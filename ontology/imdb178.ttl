Absolutely.  Is his humor and delivery similar to the great John Belushi?  Yes down to the arching eyebrows.  And I say SO WHAT? Jack Black is hilarious in this movie and director Richard Linklater the underappreciated gem Dazed and Confused uses his spoton observations of Rock music and school days to deliver a wonderful film going experience. Writer Mike White The Good Girl also plays Black's wimpy friend and former bandmate.  Although his acting is fine it is White's writing that will make him rich in Hollywood.  The kids in the band are wonderfully cast and appear to be very talented musically as well.  Special recognition to Joan Cusack who just nails the role of the uptight private school principal who is just itching to be unleashed.  I would have enjoyed a bit more of the Rock History tossed in for the sake of today's youngsters but the tributes to Pete Townsend Jimi Hendrix Zeppelin and the Ramones are much appreciated.  Look for Nikki Katt in a brief role but mostly just sit back and enjoy a pure comedy that truly ROCKS!!".

Sure maybe his character is a little onenote with his proclamations of rock on and stick it to the man but Black somehow manages to do it over and over without being boring. He's unbelievably energetic AND versatile delivering these same things in different ways each time that prevent the movie from getting into a rut. I think it's safe to say that only Black himself could have made this role work so well.There is plenty of humor and great music. Even my senior citizen parents kept laughing and told me after it was over that they enjoyed the rock soundtrack as well. It's a great movie for the whole family. Why was this rated PG13? Sure there are some references to stuff like alcohol and groupies but they are not emphasized at all in their brief passing  and your kids will already have seen these kind of things treated much worse elsewhere! In fact here in British Columbia the ratings board gave it a G rating.".

One day as he shows up late for band practice he notices a new guitar player who is replacing him. Poor Dewey feels so bad about it and also about Ned and his girlfriend threatening to kick him out since he doesn't pay any of the bills. After a few days of trying to sell his guitars which doesn't go very well the head of a school calls and asks for Ned Schneebly who is a talented substitute teacher with a good reputation. In a desperate attempt to getting money fast Dewey impersonates Ned and conveniently finds himself the teacher of a third grade  or something like that  class for several weeks ahead. Yet another one of his crazy ideas strikes him and his plan to turn his class into a rockband to win the Battle of the Bands competition is set in motion. School Of Rock is a great feelgood comedy fun for just about anyone of any age kids or adults. Jack Black does carry a lot of this film on his own but I won't be too harsh on the kids in the movie they did very well also. If anyone else should play Dewey Finn rather than Jack it just wouldn't be the same. Since Jack is actually in a rock band in real life and has played a few characters in films before who are also into music he just seemed to fit right into this film. His real passion for rock music helps a lot in this film and makes Dewey Finn one hell of a good character. The plot to this film is really good I think and Mike White did a great job on the screenplay. As did Linklater on the direction of the film.This comedy should not be ignored just because there are kids in it I enjoyed it a hell of a lot and you probably will too. 910".

School Of Rock is a great feelgood comedy fun for just about anyone of any age kids or adults. Jack Black does carry a lot of this film on his own but I won't be too harsh on the kids in the movie they did very well also. If anyone else should play Dewey Finn rather than Jack it just wouldn't be the same. Since Jack is actually in a rock band in real life and has played a few characters in films before who are also into music he just seemed to fit right into this film. His real passion for rock music helps a lot in this film and makes Dewey Finn one hell of a good character. The plot to this film is really good I think and Mike White did a great job on the screenplay. As did Linklater on the direction of the film.This comedy should not be ignored just because there are kids in it I enjoyed it a hell of a lot and you probably will too. 910";

When his friend and school teacher Ned Schneebly Mike White is called to a temporary work in an expensive private school Dewey pretends to be Ned and accepts the job. He finds talented young musicians in his class and he decides to form a rockandroll band with the students and win a competition called Battle of Bands to raise the prize and be recognized in the show business.The School of Rock is a very funny and politically incorrect comedy tailored for Jack Black. He steals the movie and rocks in the role of a rockandroll lover who dreams to be successful as a guitar player. Most of the lines belong to him and I believe this movie is his best individual performance in his successful career. Joan Cusack is excellent as usual and Miranda Cosgrove seems to have potential and be a great promise as actress. The soundtrack is a great homage to rockandroll with many classics including Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song. The DVD is full of worthwhile Extras and in the end this film is an excellent funny entertainment. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Escola de Rock School of Rock".

The Sound Of Music is the mushy Brady Bunch goody goody corny serious setinworld war II version which can be enjoyable the School Of Rock is the hard and humorous and much more up to date version. In the Sound Of Music the main character's main plight was surviving the harsh realities of Nazi World War II along with her love interest in the School Of Rock Jack Black's main plight is to survive the commercialization of music instead of Nazism i.e. getting kicked off his own band while his band members replaced him with a gorgeous dude with a great body who is more marketable and seeing that today's elementary kids are fed nothing but crap music. See how it is all modernized more up to date? Basically the School of Rock ROCKS!".

He lives with Ned Schneebly his longtime rocker buddy who has traded in his dreams of musical glory for a nagging girlfriend and a job as a substitute teacher. Desperate for money to pay the rent Dewey pretends to be Schneebly and takes a job as a sub at a snooty traditionbound prep school where the last thing the administration and the parents would want is a Jimmy Hendricks knockoff teaching their kids. And since Dewey really only knows one thing this uncredentialed professorial imposter decides to make rock'n'roll the sole focus of his curriculum turning these inward shy nerdish kids into a viable rock band  all under the radar screen of the everwatchful administrators and parents of course.Although the storyline wends its way along a predictable path writer Mike White and director Richard Linklater find a great deal of warmth and humor in the material. Dewey's utter obsession with rock music and rock history is reflected in the fact that he leads the band members in a prayer to the god of rock before a concert and screams in frustration  What have they been teaching you kids at this school?  when he finds out his pupils have never been educated in the basics of Hendricks Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Dewey is so preposterously wellmeaning and goodnatured that the audience can't help but root for him and his students as they embark on their mad quest to appear at a local battle of the bands competition unbeknownst to the powersthatbe at the school.The children playing the students are all winning and charming and Joan Cusack cuts a sympathetic figure as the uptight school principal who harbors a little bit of Stevie Nicks under her prim and proper exterior. But it is Black who makes this film his own turning what might have been a buffoonish caricature into a fullyrounded human being. Black is not afraid to cut loose and take over the screen when necessary hitting heights of unbridled mania to rival the master Jim Carrey. Yet he also realizes that he is part of an ensemble effort here and understands the importance of integrating himself into the material and not always dominating it. As a result even when certain elements of the film fall flat as they frequently do Black is always there to prop the movie back up.The School of Rock is an entertaining little comedy but unlike a real satire which would skewer the conventions of the genre it is attacking this film loses its nerve and winds up endorsing those conventions. Dewey for all his talk about defying The Man is really a rebel in name only and the film reflects the kind of feelgood populism that no true hard line iconoclast would be caught dead supporting. I guess it's too much to expect a mainstream Hollywood comedy to launch a truly savage assault on mainstream values in the way rock at its best often does. Still it might be nice to come across the unexpected sometime after all movies like Dr. Strangelove and MASH were able to do it.Until then we'll settle for what we can get. And Jack Black is good enough for now.".

	schema:headline " Jack Black's School Of Rock And Roll";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Richard Linklater and writeractor Mike White come up with a hilarious rock and roll comedy casting Jack Black in the lead. 'School of Rock' does in a way fall on the same lines of 'Sister Act' and at the same time it funnily enough mocks all those teacherstudent bonding movies about the meaning of life etc. As a teacher Black's Ned aka Dewey breaks all school rules. Screw maths. Screw History. Screw all academics. He pretty much gets his initially timid students to throw away academics and eventually to solely focus on one thing only and that is rock and roll. Although the thought might pop up 'come on rock and roll is good but academic studies are important too' Dewey doesn't care and as the film proceeds neither does the viewer. 'School of Rock' is a Jack Black film. The actor uses his fantastic flair for comedy to the max. For me he is one of the funniest actors. But 'School of Rock' is very much a collaborative effort as the kids are very good too and their interaction with Jack Black are among the highlights of the film. Joan Cusack holds her own as the uptight principle who does have a wild rocker in her and Mike White is likable too. Sarah Silverman is annoying but thankfully she's only there in a few scenes. The cast and crew clearly as is evident in the special features had a lot of fun in the making. The soundtrack is a musthave. 'School of Rock' does follow the path of 'safe' Hollywood films as the storyline isn't exactly novel but the director and writer infuse excellent materials of humour making the experience great fun with loads of laugh out loud moments. Moreover watching the DVD is a bonus as it has some awesome special features that only contributes to the laugh out loud quality of the film.".

So when Dewey answers the phone that was meant for his roommate and takes a job posing as his roommate as the new substitute teacher at a high class prep school. Since he doesn't really care and just wants the money he just sits back and relaxes. He wants to get back at his band still by competing in Battle of Bands so he takes these kids and turns them into his rock band better into the School of Rock.This has endless humor and just over all a terrific story that is so touching and I think anyone can appreciate. Even though the ending is just a smidge unrealistic it's what everyone wanted and I think we can say that it rocked! 1010".

Yea this is the Dead Poets Society wearing a clown's clothing. Just change a few variables switch drama with juvenile comedy switch high school with grade school Robin Williams with Jack Black poetry with Rock n' Roll and carpe diem with stick it to the man and you get School of Rock. And somehow this formula works to create an enjoyable giggle film. Just don't expect knee slapping humor though I can count on my left thumb the number of times I laughed out loud watching this.Jack Black plays Dewey Finn a misunderstood artist who is so misunderstood the members of his own rock band pull a PeteBest move on him by voting him out. This leaves Dewey without a band to compete in an upcoming battle of the bands contest a potential source of revenue that Dewey could have used to appease his roommate's girlfriend by paying his share of the rent for once. With no band and no job Dewey sleazes his way into a substitute teaching assignment at Horace Green Prep the state's best elementary school. The gig was intended for Ned Schneebly Dewey's substituteteaching roomie but fortunately for Dewey a simple ID check by the school's administrators wasn't on their todo list. Dewey even asks to get paid in cash or thirdparty check but that doesn't raise suspicions. Nor does the fact that he didn't know how to spell Schneebly. Just call me Mr. S he says.Now you didn't have to watch the trailers or even know the film's title to figure out where this film was heading when after Dewey makes a disparaging remark about teaching his roommate tells him that he wouldn't last a single day in a class full of kids. As any movie fan worth the salt on their popcorn knows such challenges rarely go unanswered even if they require a metaphysical soul switching procedure as in either version of Freaky Friday.Dewey's teaching career starts off with complete ambivalence on his part but his interest in the kids perks up when he discovers that they can play music. What luck. He was in need of a set of musicians to form a new band. He runs out to his decrepit van parked along side late model Volvos collects a set of instruments and introduces his class to their new secret project rock band. In addition to musicians there are groupies roadies a security crew and even a band stylist with a thing for Liza Minelli. Don't bother wondering how a rock band can practice in a quiet prep school without being detected it's not worth the amino acid computing power. Just let it go.Horace Green is headed by Joan Cusack who gives whole new meaning to being sent to the principal's office. A pair of eyeglasses might shield Clark Kent's secret identity but they don't hide Cusack's sex appeal. My grade school principal resembled Nikita Kruschev but without all the charm. And then there are the kids. Other than Angelo Massagli who plays Bobby Baccalieri Jr. on The Sopranos they are all virtually unknowns. The really amazing thing here is that the kids in the band were recruited as musicians first not actors. They really do a superb job and when I learned that they played their own instruments I was doubly impressed. I actually enjoyed the song they perform at the battle of the bands contest and a few times I booted up the DVD just to listen to the song.Before watching School of Rock I wondered if I could stand a movie staring Jack Black. He's great as the fat somewhat annoying but lovable wisecracking sidekick as he was in High Fidelity that one with two Cusacks but 90 minutes of him? I wasn't sure. To me Jack Black is a cross between the late John Belushi and the current Philip Seymour Hoffman. He's a funny guy and does a great job in this film but there was still something missing with him as the star.One headscratching point about this film is that it left me wondering who the target audience really is. There were about three or four lines in this film including one about pedophilia that should have been removed to allow the under 10 crowd to watch. It might be prudish of me but I'm not sure my eightyear old daughter should be exposed to words such as slut. Anyway I'll always give extra credit points to any DVD that doesn't start out by forcing the owner to watch a bunch of advertisements unlike the DVDs from some Mickey Mouse company I know I won't mention any names.Do the kids win in the battle of the bands? Do rebellious teach and hot principal hook up? Do the parents find out what's going on? You'll all just have to learn this for yourselves. See you in the back row.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dewey Finn is an arrogant outlandish musician without a cent to his name however he is a catalyst to pursuing ambitions. Through its humor the movie is able to relate to the dreamer that will never quit in every viewer. School of Rock is an inspiring movie about children and young adults not only pursuing their ambitions but also inspiring and encouraging others to pursue theirs even through opposition. The perception of Jack Black's character Dewey Finn is an overweight washedup broke musician. Despite the criticism he receives he refuses to be anything other than a musician. Ebert says Dewey Finn does not start as a disreputable character and then turn gooey. Jack Black remains true to his irascible character all the way through he makes Dewey's personality not a plot gimmick but a way of life. Black is in almost the entire movie and wildly entertaining in each scene. Whether he is dancing like a maniac in front of his class or singing math songs his mannerisms and facial responses are the highlight of the comedic genius in School of Rock. After being kicked out of his rock and roll band Dewey finds himself at a crossroads be poor or give up music. Desperate to pay rent and still be a musician he steals a gig from Ned Schneebly his friend and his landlord as a substitute teacher at a private school. This uptight private school is the last place a person of Dewey's crude personality and short temper belongs. Ned is Dewey's ironic antagonist he represents what would happen if Dewey gave up on his dreams but unlike most antagonists he is soft spoken and a pushover. Ned Mike White is a dullard who says few words in the movie except when he tells Dewey that he misses music everyday. Dewey is dumbfounded when he realizes a substitute teacher is more than just a temp who sits behind the desk quietly this shocks him into realizing that he does not belong in the classroom. Rainer points out His fifthgrade class doesn't know what to make of him especially when he declares an allday recess and hungry swipes a sandwich from one of his students. Dewey hatches the idea to teach the children about the only thing he can teach rock and roll or what he considers real music. Holden says Dewey is flabbergasted when his students cite Christina Aguilera the musical Annie and Liza Minnelli as their musical influences and claim total ignorance of Dewey's personal hardrock pantheon. In order to culture them he teaches them more than just names and songs he teaches them how to act like rock and roll stars. Motivation to be productive as a substitute comes to Dewey when he recognizes that the students are talented and they need someone to enhance their rock and roll abilities. Dewey is energized at the chalkboard when he draws an intricate diagram covering the vast topic of rock and roll. He turns the dry mundane classroom into a creative space that is unique for each student's passions. Holden says Those who are not musicians design lights costumes and sound or serve as roadies. Dewey explores what each member is capable of and uses it to enhance the band as a whole. School of Rock connects with viewers by attesting to the fact that no goal can be accomplished without overcoming some obstacles. Lawrence a keyboardist tells Dewey that he is not cool enough to be in the bandSchool of Rock. Dewey tells him you could be the ugliest sad sack on the planet but if you are in a rocking band you are the cat's pajamasSchool of Rock. Dewey has personally faced many critics for his appearance or how he is not cool enough but continues to perform regardless. Tomika Myra Hassan another student asks Dewey if she can avoid preforming because she is sensitive about her weight. Ebert notes this scene You have an issue with weight?  Dewey asks. You know who else has a weight issue? Me! But I get up there on the stage and start to sing and people worship me. This touches on the fact that most viewers have felt inadequate in the pursuit of his dreams but in the achievement of his or her dreams he or she becomes adequate and even prodigious. The most worthwhile lesson Dewey teaches the class is about sticking it to the man School of Rock. Dewey has all his students get heated and tell him off. Lawrence generally quiet tells him he is a fat loser and has body odorSchool of Rock. The students have all gained a backbone and some since the beginning of the movie when they were conformists to their systematic school. Whether the school is enforcing the strict dress code or the student's parent is yelling at them for listening to rock and roll the students have learned to think for themselves and do what they believe in. The students are diverse there is a grade grubber a stereotypically cool kid an insecure girl and every other type of child. The children connect with Black convincingly throughout the entirety of the movie whether they are supposed to believe Black to be their new substitute or their fellow band member. As a band Black and the students are able to stick it to the man and pursue their ambitions despite the negativity they receive.School of Rock ends with a grand finale at the Battle of the Bands with a conglomeration of the parents teachers the former band and the new band School of Rock. Despite the fact that the entire movie is about performing at the Battle of the Bands it becomes less and less important as the movie progresses. School of Rock becomes more about how finding a passion that gives you joy and pursuing is greater than focusing on being the absolute best.".

He turns the dry mundane classroom into a creative space that is unique for each student's passions. Holden says Those who are not musicians design lights costumes and sound or serve as roadies. Dewey explores what each member is capable of and uses it to enhance the band as a whole. School of Rock connects with viewers by attesting to the fact that no goal can be accomplished without overcoming some obstacles. Lawrence a keyboardist tells Dewey that he is not cool enough to be in the bandSchool of Rock. Dewey tells him you could be the ugliest sad sack on the planet but if you are in a rocking band you are the cat's pajamasSchool of Rock. Dewey has personally faced many critics for his appearance or how he is not cool enough but continues to perform regardless. Tomika Myra Hassan another student asks Dewey if she can avoid preforming because she is sensitive about her weight. Ebert notes this scene You have an issue with weight?  Dewey asks. You know who else has a weight issue? Me! But I get up there on the stage and start to sing and people worship me. This touches on the fact that most viewers have felt inadequate in the pursuit of his dreams but in the achievement of his or her dreams he or she becomes adequate and even prodigious. The most worthwhile lesson Dewey teaches the class is about sticking it to the man School of Rock. Dewey has all his students get heated and tell him off. Lawrence generally quiet tells him he is a fat loser and has body odorSchool of Rock. The students have all gained a backbone and some since the beginning of the movie when they were conformists to their systematic school. Whether the school is enforcing the strict dress code or the student's parent is yelling at them for listening to rock and roll the students have learned to think for themselves and do what they believe in. The students are diverse there is a grade grubber a stereotypically cool kid an insecure girl and every other type of child. The children connect with Black convincingly throughout the entirety of the movie whether they are supposed to believe Black to be their new substitute or their fellow band member. As a band Black and the students are able to stick it to the man and pursue their ambitions despite the negativity they receive.School of Rock ends with a grand finale at the Battle of the Bands with a conglomeration of the parents teachers the former band and the new band School of Rock. Despite the fact that the entire movie is about performing at the Battle of the Bands it becomes less and less important as the movie progresses. School of Rock becomes more about how finding a passion that gives you joy and pursuing is greater than focusing on being the absolute best.";

	schema:reviewBody "I like to consider myself a rock 'n' roller and metalhead. I love all rock music from Chuck Berry and Little Richard to Alter Bridge and Weezer. Actually not really all rock music these days I'm very picky. I love all metal from Black Sabbath and Motorhead to Trivium and All That Remains. Several movies look into the subject of rock and roll but for some reason I find this to be the best one. Not because they explore the subject of heavy metal along with rock and punk. I guess because it was the first rock movie I'd ever seen and it had a huge impact on me. Well one reason.In his breakout role Jack Black plays a talented and hyper musician named Dewey Finn who aspires to be a famous rockstar. Desperate for money he owes to his more conservative roommate White and fired from his group due to his out of control behaviour he lies about being his roommate who is a substitute teacher and goes to make big bucks at a prep school. When he sees how talented the kids are he decides to make a band with them and gets them entered in the Battle of the Bands contest to win some money and beat his old band.Everybody knows that Jack Black is funny and a good actor but School of Rock shows his highly impressive talent in music and just how good of an actor he can be. Black really does know all the music knowledge he displays in the film and it really is him playing all those instruments and singing. I got some of my musical knowledge from watching this. I never knew how amazing of a singer Black is. I honestly think he could sing opera. One of the best voices I have ever heard. In his previous band No Vacancy Broadway star Adam Pascal plays the lead singer. We get to hear some of his juicy chops too. Pascal is classically trained and was the original Roger in Rent but I think Black is just a natural. It is tough to say who is better. It is also tough to say who is better between Black and the kids. All the kids are great musicians and great actors.Gene Shallit panned this movie because of Jack Black. He is worse in other films like Year One. Although not his most serious it does justify that Black can act.Another quality I liked about this is that is about giving the chance to open up and be themselves. In order to be a rockstar you to have to be crazy and let loose. He subs at a super strict prep school so the kids are more than just mechanical. He brings them out of their shells which leads to a student writing their title song. But it's not just the kids he influences Joan Cusack plays the uptight principal who is overly stressed at her work. He even has a positive influence on her. This element is really what sets this apart from the others.".

The ending is extremely powerful completely unexpected and expected at the same time. Mali finally makes a choice for herself and we are left hoping that her life will be a happy one.This film brought me to tears on several occasions.

Whichever side of the story you may be either the touching romance against all odds or the practical considerations of secular enmity at the end you will reflect at length and be enriched by this film. With precise timing and increasing emotional leverage Yedaya mounts a gradual increase in tension a catastrophe and then gives us more the wonderful struggle within the future mother.

Scenes of great emotional intensity are shot in vignettes brimming with concealed pain... At the end of the film the debate is far from close but the hope the child of both Israeli and Arab is something we have in front of us unmistakenly.

I really enjoyed the performance by Ronit Elkabetz as I have seen her in The Band's Visit. It was fun to watch. There was also a great performance by Dana Ivgy who portrayed Mali Wolf. She appeared so innocent and believable as the daughter who falls for a Palestinian worker and decides to keep it a secret from her family  even after becoming pregnant.While I have no idea if it represented the relationships between Jews and Palestines I really hope that these type of relationships happen each and every day in their world. There is a chance for peace!!".

Sat through rooted to my seat as if I was watching a thriller and I can't even remember which thriller. The love. Most of the characters are very mature and portray largeness of heart. Inspite there are certain differences that you just can't break. These get built into the psyche purely based on your circumstance. The racial hostility between a jew and an arab makes sense to a jew and an arab but not to an Indian. The actors. There were so many actors who have done excellent excellent work. The Arab the nonchalance with which he performs he almost looks like he strayed into the camera field without knowing. The way he comes out of jail and his expression changes as he sees his brothers. None of the theatrics just a smile. The father has done a great job. The mother. The sister. The brother  every one. To me there is no actor in the movie except may be the Arab's mother and sister. The direction is excellent too. I think most of the movie is shot in low lighting. The setting is also very dry. The movie felt so real It could pass off as a documentary.However there were challenging shots for actors to perform too. It was great story telling  uncomplicated technique. The viewer is given full time to appreciate the situation. It is not like those Hollywood movies where one wacky dialogue you miss  you miss the plot and then you go back and admire  oh what a tricky way to convey. Nonsense. This one was direct. Dil Se. You can feel the warmth of the relationships in spite of the fact that no elaborate situation has been built artificially to convey this".

Jews are not cast as brainy but thrifty business moguls.Instead the moviegoer gets to look into the lives of these two groups of people and judge for themselves. Jaffa does not however show the true nasty side of Israel it ignores the fact that tens of miles away Palestinians are being completely deprived of their basic human rights squeezed together behind a cruel apartheid wall by Israel.Is Israel even ready for a movie like Jaffa? I will argue that yes it is time for Israelis to accept Palestinians as people deserving of equal rights in a society that has so long denied them that.

	schema:reviewBody "Poor Death. The guy can't seem to catch a break. He's got a job to do and now for a third time he's being kept from doing it. What's worse is he's being foiled by a bunch of high school kids! That can't be good for the ego. Within that context you can't really blame the guy for trying to finish the job. Heck if I were Death I'd totally relish taking some of these brats out. Particularly the guy who calls himself Frankie Cheeks. Sheesh if that guy were any more annoying then his name would most likely be Chris Kattan.Anyway this is a movie that's very easy to review. Did you like the first two entries in the Final Destination franchise? Do you like to watch irritating characters meet unseemly demises? If so then you'll love it. If not then save your money. I don't want to hear any complaining.Personally I morbidly enjoyed it. The movie starts off with a cringeinducing roller coaster disaster one that will likely make you think twice about setting foot in an amusement park again and it rarely slows down for a breather. The filmmakers set out to ensure that the viewer like a child at Neverland Ranch is never at ease and that goal is accomplished as each scene leaves the viewer nervously anticipating who is going to die next.Yeah yeah Wendy and Kevin are desperately trying to save their peers from Death's cruel hand but come on. We all know somebody's head is about to be turned into ground beef or somebody will be on the receiving end of a dismemberment soon. We wait ... wait ... wait ... and then BAM! Gory kill. I should probably feel guilty for laughing out loud at some of these fatalities but since these are silly little characters that didn't die in real life I've decided not to let it weigh on my conscience.A new element to the franchise is that clues are being left as to how the characters will die. Using her nifty digital camera Wendy was busy taking pictures for the yearbook on that fateful night. After the accident she begins examining the pictures and realizes that she has taken at least one picture of each survivor. A little more studying reveals that she might be able to use the photos to help the characters escape Death. Is this a case of Death playing a sadistic game with Wendy and Kevin or is there some sort of benevolent life force that's trying to help them save their friends? The filmmakers leave it up to the viewer to decide.This is a nice touch that keeps the viewer actively involved in the cinematic proceedings. It gives us the chance to try to interpret the clues and guess who might be Death's next victim and how they'll be violently killed. Perhaps that's not exactly an activity you want to participate in so keep it in mind before laying your money down.One thing that really gauges whether a movie connects with its target audience is the crowd's reaction and I have to say that Final Destination 3 got the loudest most involved reaction I've witnessed in quite a while. While the deaths were being thrown at us fast and hard the audience was oohing and ahhing with every single one. During one particularly brutal scene a girl behind me let out a highpitched shriek so loud that I had to turn around and make sure Chris Tucker hadn't wandered into the theater.No one goes to see a Final Destination movie with the expectation of great acting and high brow art. They just want to be scared or freaked out. Love it or hate it there's no denying that Final Destination 3 at least forces you to have an opinion about it. It'll make you cringe it'll make you turn your head in disgust but at least it's original and creative enough to make you feel something other than absolute boredom like some other socalled horror movies out there COUGHwhenastrangercallsHACK.If just one person decides not to ride a roller coaster the next time they're at an amusement park then the filmmakers have done their job.".

In the film seriousness coexists with comedy while the latter is more frequent than the first. Comedy most of all stems from characters with very low IQ. One of them shouts with superiority something like death will never defeat me and then dies in most ridiculous way. Thus the film is intentionally laughable at times. What's more the flick abounds with awesome deaths and these quality gore scenes are probably the biggest virtues of this horror movie. Besides the script is rather superficial and repetitive. I only liked an idea of photos depicting how victims will die. That's it. Other feature ideas were taken from previous parts. To sum up this flick is worth watching especially with your mates.".

I feel that this movie is a lot better than the first two because of the new properties. The Pictures that tell Wendy how the people die. I also liked the second premonition of the train crash at the end. Personally My favorite death was the one in the weight room. I mean you thought that the swords were going to cut the guys head off. Didn't you! I know you did. Any way It was sudden for him to lift the weights and then they fall sideways and crush his head. I really didn't expect that!!!I also thought that the Roller Coaster crash Was really cool.Usually when there is a sequel to a movie it isn't as good as the first but that isn't true for this sequel. It is ten times the excitementGoreand thrill as the first two. I myself am right now Writing Final Destination 5 Because I hear that the fourth one is about a casino accident. If Any of you readers have any Ideas for deaths please email me at DramaDude926aol.com and Title it Final Destination 5. Thanks for reading. DramaDude926".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been waiting a while for this film to come out. I thought that it was very well done looking at the cinematography. The original director James Wong coming back was a good thing because the second was more about the gore and less about the plot and such. Wong brought back a better plot along with some pretty creative deaths. The opening scene had my pulse running high as I felt like I was there and on the ride. I like how certain themes were continued such as the opening scene being a vision of something horrible to happen some pattern to the dying and trying to spot someones death and warnsave them right before it happens. To warn the viewer there are some disturbing deaths that are worse than others  but I found that to be true with the 1st and 2nd movies also. The problem that most people have had with the movie was that it was all about the dying scenes and nothing else. You have to be a big fan like me  or just like that kind of movie to really appreciate it. If you go go with a friend or someone because this is one of those great films that leaves you not wanting to be alone for the night. Overall I believe it was a great end to a series. Taken by itself it is amazing.".

	schema:headline " A Horror Series turning out to be really something!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Uniqueness is something very very hard to accomplish in the Horror Genre nowadays. Slasher films almost always have the same M.O. and that's not a bad thing but to find a unique one that started in 2000...Final Destination stands alone. In this third installment six years after the original three after the second one it continues it's own M.O. and continues to impress and be a really great series that is possibly one of the most disturbing and scary films out there just for it's sole realness to it. Final Destination works like a comedian...ie It's funny because it's true...well this is Horror because it's true. No other film makes you think hard about every single object situation and chain reaction you can possibly think of.The acting has never been A in the series and still isn't in this one. I mean it isn't bad and the cast is definitely sufficient but they aren't what holds together the film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead takes the lead role as the girl who sees horrible visions of death. She's quite intense and a good scream queen but nothing stand out. Ryan Merriman is the lead actor playing narrowly saved friend Kevin Fischer. With a little study and some mention of the original film the two of them set out to try and save everyone who got off the roller coaster and therefore is now on Death's radar to be knocked off. Anyone else in the film is basically expendable as proved by their rather horrific and well thought out deaths. One of the most unique things about The Final Destination series is that the killer is the same throughout but they never have to put him in any physical form...the killer is death...period. Perhaps some day when they are ready to drain this series they can put him in some sort of physical form but until then it's enough to know that it exists.Original director James Wong returns to the helm for the third installment and it's obvious he knows the script and ideas quite well. If slasher flicks try to find the most unique deaths...well Final Destination hones that to a science. You won't find any more unique and gory deaths than in this film or the previous ones. There are some jaw dropping cover your eyes death scenes that will make you cringe. Certainly make sure you see the original films before checking out number three but this one is worth seeing in the theaters for sure. It is one of the best Horror Films out there right now and it makes horror out of every day events and settings. The first one was the horrific plane accident the second film was that deadly nightmarish car accidentpile up and now the third installment will make you never look at a roller coaster again. Definitely worth seeing for fans of gore blood and horror!!! I will mention that the film is deadly short...haven't seen a movie this short in a long long time but it doesn't ruin it any just worth mentioning. 810".

The first and second were 2 gory brash and trashy films and didn't attempt to pretend they weren't and the third followed the same route.The plot in itself was pretty thin and the characters were really just people on a hit list no strong characterisation but then it wasn't needed! This is a no brainer snuff movie and it rocks. Some gratuitous amounts of gore and a little nudity here and there and you have the perfect film to waste away the boredom welling up inside you after sitting through Harry Potter. The actors all do fine jobs and the special effects are pretty much topnotch when they're not CGI and the pace just moves along nicely.The 2 major bad points are  The CGI  It was pretty noticeable and it did take away some of the magic of the Rollercoaster scenein my opinion anyway and secondly it was way too short and there weren't enough deaths in it! That sounds a little demented I know but I actually found myself yearning for just a little more... but no. Excellent ending though it surprised me I have to say.A good strong film altogether a perfect date movie but you'll never EVER look at a Tanning Bed or a picture for that matter the same way again.GO SEE IT!".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me tell you I will NEVER look at a rollercoaster the same way again. Or an exercise machine. I'll be a little wary around nail guns too. Be extracareful around tanning beds. Oh and board subways at your own risk.The opening scene of this movie was fantastic. I actually got the same feeling watching them board the coaster that I get when actually climbing into them myself. My heart began to beat fast my heart seemed to levitate into my throat helping me realize that my throat could not have been any drier. The coaster's ascent to the top of the initial hill was extremely prolonged not in an annoying way but in a way that made the scene all the more effective. All it takes is a video camera's painful fall to the bottom of the coaster's loop to ensure the ending the lives of a varied group of strikingly attractive teenage rollercoaster fanatics.The most frightening part of the rollercoaster disaster was when the harnesses on the coaster first came up. I cannot imagine how terrifying that would be. The actors in this sequence did a fantastic job in portraying this horror. It did not take much longer before you see the seemingly innocent high schoolers getting hurled out of the coaster and plunging towards imminent death that Death had reserved for them. Not much longer every single participant on the ride was dead as a doornail.Wait it didn't happen yet! The last girl to die on the ride Wendy Christensen a generically likable girl with an odd haircut that progressively grew on me throughout the film saw the whole disaster in her head. A premonition she called it. This is where the movie becomes incredibly similar to the two before it. Not neccassarily a bad thing but I was hoping for a little twist maybe.To make a long story short Death was not happy with Wendy. Oh not with Kevin Fischer the generically likable jock that surprised you with the occasional intellectual insight either. Wendy being the photographer for the high school yearbook had pictures of the wouldbe rollercoaster victims each of them holding a 'clue' regarding their future and very imminent death.Let's see... Ashley and Ashlyn were the first to bite it. Their death scene was easily the best and most commercialized one. I mean these girls suffered. Note to self don't go to a tanning salon anytime soon.Frankie Cheeks was the perverted sickening character that you could tell the whole theater was waiting for to die. Sure enough a few sexual comments and middle fingers later he met his match with an whirling engine blade from Kevin's car.Next Death had the pleasure of dealing with Lewis a dude who actually thought that Death would be afraid of him. Death retaliated by sending hundredsomething pound weights down to give his head or soon lack thereof a little hint.The next death actually upset me a little. I didn't really want to see the appealing brainy emo couple Erin and Ian die. I actually kind of liked them. Unfortunately Death didn't. Wendy and Kevin thought they saved Ian from some falling fence posts at the home improvement store and right before they started celebrating a poorlyplaced nail gun relocated its nails in Erin's head. That scene went on far too long and I wanted Erin to just die after one nail but it took about 12 more nails to do it. It was painful to watch.Next Wendy had to save her sister Julie almost killing Kevin actually killing Julie's friend Perry who was the next to die after Erin who was the girlfriend of Ian who wanted to kill Wendy who was still with Kevin and Julie who were both just saved by Wendy. All of this confusion ends when Ian is hit by a giant billboard crushing him just like a fly getting whacked with a flyswatter.Ahh... 5 months later. Everything must be back to normal now... right? Don't get your hopes up. Also don't get your hopes up about getting any decent closure to this movie. I won't ruin it for you but you will not be disappointed. It will differ if you have an optimistic or pessimistic opinion of the characters. The ending is dependant on the condition that you have any sympathy for them or if you have any level of admiration for Death.".

Oh and board subways at your own risk.The opening scene of this movie was fantastic. I actually got the same feeling watching them board the coaster that I get when actually climbing into them myself. My heart began to beat fast my heart seemed to levitate into my throat helping me realize that my throat could not have been any drier. The coaster's ascent to the top of the initial hill was extremely prolonged not in an annoying way but in a way that made the scene all the more effective. All it takes is a video camera's painful fall to the bottom of the coaster's loop to ensure the ending the lives of a varied group of strikingly attractive teenage rollercoaster fanatics.The most frightening part of the rollercoaster disaster was when the harnesses on the coaster first came up. I cannot imagine how terrifying that would be. The actors in this sequence did a fantastic job in portraying this horror. It did not take much longer before you see the seemingly innocent high schoolers getting hurled out of the coaster and plunging towards imminent death that Death had reserved for them. Not much longer every single participant on the ride was dead as a doornail.Wait it didn't happen yet! The last girl to die on the ride Wendy Christensen a generically likable girl with an odd haircut that progressively grew on me throughout the film saw the whole disaster in her head. A premonition she called it. This is where the movie becomes incredibly similar to the two before it. Not neccassarily a bad thing but I was hoping for a little twist maybe.To make a long story short Death was not happy with Wendy. Oh not with Kevin Fischer the generically likable jock that surprised you with the occasional intellectual insight either. Wendy being the photographer for the high school yearbook had pictures of the wouldbe rollercoaster victims each of them holding a 'clue' regarding their future and very imminent death.Let's see... Ashley and Ashlyn were the first to bite it. Their death scene was easily the best and most commercialized one. I mean these girls suffered. Note to self don't go to a tanning salon anytime soon.Frankie Cheeks was the perverted sickening character that you could tell the whole theater was waiting for to die. Sure enough a few sexual comments and middle fingers later he met his match with an whirling engine blade from Kevin's car.Next Death had the pleasure of dealing with Lewis a dude who actually thought that Death would be afraid of him. Death retaliated by sending hundredsomething pound weights down to give his head or soon lack thereof a little hint.The next death actually upset me a little. I didn't really want to see the appealing brainy emo couple Erin and Ian die. I actually kind of liked them. Unfortunately Death didn't. Wendy and Kevin thought they saved Ian from some falling fence posts at the home improvement store and right before they started celebrating a poorlyplaced nail gun relocated its nails in Erin's head. That scene went on far too long and I wanted Erin to just die after one nail but it took about 12 more nails to do it. It was painful to watch.Next Wendy had to save her sister Julie almost killing Kevin actually killing Julie's friend Perry who was the next to die after Erin who was the girlfriend of Ian who wanted to kill Wendy who was still with Kevin and Julie who were both just saved by Wendy. All of this confusion ends when Ian is hit by a giant billboard crushing him just like a fly getting whacked with a flyswatter.Ahh... 5 months later. Everything must be back to normal now... right? Don't get your hopes up. Also don't get your hopes up about getting any decent closure to this movie. I won't ruin it for you but you will not be disappointed. It will differ if you have an optimistic or pessimistic opinion of the characters. The ending is dependant on the condition that you have any sympathy for them or if you have any level of admiration for Death.";

	schema:reviewBody "Film review final destination 3 Final destination 3 is about teenagers trying to cheat death which is following them because they survived at first when they should have died. So at first the movie took place in a theme park and everything was alright until they sat on a roller coaster which is going to come off the rails and everyone will die however one teen girl whose name is Wendy  Mary Elisabeth Winsted  predicts the catastrophe and a few of her class mates got out off the cars which is cheating death but her boyfriend went on the ride. Soon her premonition becomes true and all the time death tries to kill them in order of how they were sitting. The main characters attend McKinley high school and were celebrating their graduation. Throughout the first half of the film Wendy wasn't trusted by her friends because she was predicting how they will die by looking on their photos which she made and only Kevin Ryan Merriman was supporting her and he was the man who saved lots of lives with Wendy. Wendy herself was beautiful not outgoing and a modest person what you definitely can't say about Kevin  he was always on the move but he wasn't careful or brave enough sometimes for example when Wendy suggested him to look at their photos in order to save their lives Kevin became scared and said that he doesn't want to know how he will die however Wendy looked at the snapshots and saved the lives of both friends. The film became even more interesting when they understood that it is possible to save people so if death misses someone it won't come back. For me the film was credible and sometimes really really realistic. I wouldn't call it a horror movie because the characters showed all fear on themselves and was well matched with nice music which makes you even more interested in the plot of the movie. Also the thing I enjoyed very much is that they didn't try to over show emotions while people were saving each other sometimes they had to act quickly but still nice emotions. However excluding good moments each film has bad sides which I want to talk about now. Everyone understand that film cant show all moments of your live but I didn't understand how Wendy could forget about her loss so quickly as it showed there  she was just little bit sad for one day and then everything became fine. In addition sometimes citizens were dying in a strange way like Kevin in the metro there was accident with two trains pushing each other and Kevin was thrown to the window which was slowly cracking and instead of going away he was just lying on one place .Final Destination is thriller horror and mystery movie which is inappropriate for children under 15 years old there are naked people goriness however I would say that it is only scary for some because some people are really worried about characters' death which makes them fret about them a lot.Mostly my opinion about this film is positive and I would recommend you to watch it. The director of this film James Wong created a really believable story which made me truly worried about the actions which were happening during the most interesting sections of the film in fact I can say that it is one of the best films I had ever seen. In spite of what I just said there are few facts which made this film not my favourite one. I think that there should be more time between deaths to make the characters more interesting for example  at the end of the film there were three deaths in three minutes. Also in the place of the director I would have made more difference between the different final destination films. So if your parents will allow you to watch this film then you definitely have to watch Final Destination 3!".

What you don't know is how people are going to die what twists will they put in will they then try to forever escape death or try to end it? It had the usual teen movie stereotypes the perfect couple the nearly perfect couple jock Goth's and preppy Vally girls. You know as soon as it starts the perfect couple will split the nearly perfect couple the girl is gonna dump the apparently chauvinistic guys ass and he wants to marry her the valley girls don't have one braincell between them and that the sister that shouldn't be there the sibling rivalry will be broken bonds made then it will come back into play later then bonds remade.They didn't skip skip skippity skip like the first one they didn't learn how to stop it like the second oh no they pretty much accepted they were gonna die and tried to skip it thought by the last person it was done and then death seemed to just go oh feck it not again ill let them off until 5 months later he's all a little peed at them figuring him out and death goes right I'm gonna put you all in a big metal box train try and escape this b1tch! and then to the girl who had the premonition feck my design up will you well you can suffer and her death is so strung out.OK technical things now. No one seems to appreciate good cinematography any more. The intro was great we know from the trailer that it takes place in a theme park they use that to their advantage and go with all kinds of imagery from carny freak shows and also using the tarot card reader machines as a way to tell the film. The CGI of the ball in the machine dropping between fate luck and other things before falling into death was a good touch. I loved the way they sped up and slowed down the movement of the rides in the park it just added a more sinister touch especially with the way peoples screams fade in and out like you hear on those rides that go round and round.I loved the juxtaposition in the death of the valley girls two sunbeds by the side of each other two coffins by the side of each other and the corny irony of their song love rollercoaster in fact the songs were wonderfully picked to be sarcastic ending with love train after the last three have just died on the train.Overall if you are fan of the previous Final Destinations you will love this film it has more suspenseful bits and build ups than usual and they are really well done. You know you are going to see a corny film about death what should the problem be thats what you get ".

	schema:reviewBody "No sir I did not like it.Ok there are plenty of SPOILERS below for all 3 Final Destination films it could not be avoided. There is also some angry ranting. Be warned. Final Destination has a great premise. Hard to go wrong with it in fact. Many of the major horror franchises thrive on original and over the top deaths and with FD the possibilities are infinite.Final Destination 2 was a great sequel. It took much of the best features of the first film and cranked it up a notch or two.Final Destination 3 is an example of a wonderful premise and a good franchise being squandered. The deaths which this series lives by were uninspiring in comparison to the previous instalments. The 'Big Sequence' of the Roller Coaster ride was fairly uneventful in truth. Most of the deaths in that sequence were off camera People falling out or due to the coaster's speed a case of blinkandyoumissit. Compare that to the stellar Car Crash sequence in the second film and you realise that a Roller Coaster From Hell might sound great on paper but it is an extremely linear ride in all senses.Then there are the slow build deaths. The first film had the long drawn out death of the teacher. The second had the Kitchen  Fire Escape sequence. Both of which kept you guessing right until the end. Extremely engaging film making. All the deaths in this came across as either 'BAM!' out of nowhere or blatantly obvious. The Tanning Sequence was indeed long and drawn out but you could see where it was going right from the off. And don't get me started on that 'Warning Must'nt go over 250' Sticker. Suspension of disbelief collapsed in an instant. The only attempts to throw you off the scent were in the Gym Sequence however with noknowledge of the design of that Gym Machine I couldn't possibly have seen it coming nor do I understand why those weights swung down like they did Why were the wires keeping them out? What purpose would it serve letting them swing down at all? Why not bolt them?.Is it just me or did they break their own rule when killing McKinley too? The way it seems to work is that you can only save yourself or others through premonition. The trio ducked the fireworks Which Death had set in motion easily and they ended up killing McKinley. So what? By ducking they skipped Wendy? No since McKinley was supposed to kill her. They killed McKinley and so that saved Wendy? No if anyone killed McKinley it was Death and his Fireworks. Gah! The idea of McKinley being Death's chosen method was an excellent one but the execution in more ways than one was disappointing.END SPOILERS If you haven't seen it this is not the comment for you. I cannot express my rage at this film without revealing details of it. Please save your money go see something else. Go pick up FD1  2. Please.".

Final Destination has a great premise. Hard to go wrong with it in fact. Many of the major horror franchises thrive on original and over the top deaths and with FD the possibilities are infinite.Final Destination 2 was a great sequel. It took much of the best features of the first film and cranked it up a notch or two.Final Destination 3 is an example of a wonderful premise and a good franchise being squandered.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Sky Crawlers";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sky Crawlers seem to live up to its name that it really took its time to tell a story but in doing so allowed for the narrative to sink in. After all it's brought to us by Mamoru Oshii and as far as his filmography goes this Japanese maestro's works is often deep and have more than enough room for multiple viewings each time allowing you to take away something different or unnoticed from the previous time round.Adapted by Chihiro Itou from Hiroshi Mori's story you could see the themes that this movie had that would interest Oshii to be at the helm. They are nothing relatively new as fans would see some similarities in the characters' struggle about their own existentialism and what I enjoyed most the connected thread between war and peace. It's like the notion of having to prepare for war that you get to enjoy some peace and I guess every National Serviceman would have heard that at one point or another during their tour of duty.While one can find some distinct parallels from Americanized films that pay homage or blatantly ripping off Oshii's earlier works what I thought could have been toned down was how toward the end subtlety wasn't the rule of thumb and almost every theory got explained verbatim. There were enough unanswered questions along the way to tickle your brain leaving you guessing and drawing your own conclusions but there were at least two crystal clear moments that decided to tell all and show all taking away most of the fun. So in a way you have less room to maneuver your thoughts during that aftermovie discussion with friends.I could imagine and understand any kid sitting inside a theatre hall having absolutely no patience for this masterpiece. Except for the opening sequence which had packed in the action at Top Gun pace one's notion that this was going to be a waraction movie gets thrown out the window within 10 minutes. Naturally it has the potential to go in that direction by playing up and extending the aerial dogfights but to do so would be to dumb this film down a lot of notches.Granted its characters are pilots and kid pilots at that Kildren I would like to think of it as KillerChildren who don't seem to grow up get careers in Corporations that seem to be waging war on behalf of nations and pilot propellerpowered warplanes to engage their enemy in attacking and defending routines. Heck there's even a Red Baron equivalent as the resident bogeyman too! They smoke they kill up in the air and they make love with nary an adult batting an eyelid that you would deem them all turning a blind eye to their kids' shenanigans of course there's a reason for this. Imagine the adults being quite nonchalant and some even supportive of kids fighting wars while they go about their daily lives being quite unaffected other than being a feature in news bulletins.So we follow the adventures and mysteries weaved amongst the characters of Kannami Yuichi voiced by Ryo Kase base commander Kusanagi Rinko Kikuchi of Babel fame who had also collaborated in Oshii's omnibus movie Kill under the segment Assault Girl 2. The remaining supporting characters serve out their primary purpose such as Tokino Shosuke Tanihara as the wingmanbuddy and Mitsuya Chiaki Kruiyama Kill Bill's Gogo Yubari as the tellall mouthpiece which I thought that even without the coda after the end credits roll would have summed it all up nicely.This is Japanese anime so its quality is excellent with some really photorealistic moments and aerial dogfights that look as real as if they really built those planes and shot them in mid air. John Woo would also be proud at how balletic the shootemups can get pulling back its punches as well to avoid any explicitness in its violence. The main theme of the soundtrack is extremely hypnotic and would linger on you for some time after the end credits roll. After all it's by Kenji Kawai.This is not an action movie period. If that's the kind of movie you're expecting then my advice would be to save your ticket money. If you're looking toward something that's more contemplative and dealing with themes that would make you think along the way until the two mentioned moments where the hints get more obvious and maybe even appreciate life a little more then march up to the box office when this opens next week. Highly recommended and definitely a contender when I compile the top ten list for the year!".

	schema:headline " a masterwork of subtlety";
	schema:reviewBody "Imagine an animation whose driving metaphor is the sky bustling with clouds and fighter planes. I would bet you are already thinking of adjectives like action and fastpaced to describe such a film. Well think again.In fact Mamoru Oshii's latest feature film is surprisingly lowkey. Fans of his previous work will not be disappointed but even those familiar with his typical moody antics and his meandering selfreflective style from movies like Ghost in the Shell or Avalon may find the pace of this film hardgoing. Characters are distant and understated. Places are remote and static. Action is fleeting and almost random. Dialogue is sparse and vague. All of this makes for a challenging experience.How though does it pay off? How does the film pull it off? Well it is difficult to explain this without either giving too much away or saying far too little but the main point is perfectly understandable without any spoilers The salvaging fact of the movie is its logical progression towards perfect explication of its premises towards perfect selfexplanation. This film pays off wonderfully towards the end. The way it does it is being faithful to its own pace and rhythm. Yes characters may be understated  but for a reason. Yes places are remote  but for a reason. And on and on so it goes... There will be a moment when everything just clicks into place. The serenity and straightforwardness of the film is also its greatest strength. It is like a long algebraic expression that crunches away slowly in the background but ultimately overwhelms the viewer in a Heureka! moment. For a film that starts opaque everything becomes transparent by the end. It doesn't rely on tricks or cheating the audience. It is a perfectly honest and also perfectly brutally realist film. It makes explicit references to Camus and this makes sense in the context of the classically existentialist questions the movie raises. For its theme and mood it feels very European and American it even features quite a bit of English dialogue and there's no Japanese cutesyness in the film. It is a very serious and mature movie in a way that combines the best of both European literature and Japanese culture.Despite its universal and abstract nature and despite its stylized alternative American backdrop the best reference point for the style of the film is the cinema of the masters of Japanese understatement Yasujir Ozu and Akira Kurosawa. Indeed the movie's subtle aesthetic eye belongs to the tradition of the Japanese outlook on life crystallized in the concept of mono no aware translatable as transience of things. If the movie is existentialist it is so in a way that only a Japanese film can be. The movie then is very Japanese and very universal. It combines realism with symbolic and sciencefiction elements in a way that is reminiscent of the equally slowpaced spiritual materialism of the master director Andrei Tarkovsky.So Sky Crawlers succeeds because it starts out with banally normal situations and people but by the end increasingly problematizes its own deceptive normalcy and shows the underlying tensions bubbling under the calm surface. In other words the film is both straightforward and complex both obvious and difficult both downtoearth and transcendent. This contrast between ground and air is in a very obvious way incorporated into the plot  it is after all a movie about pilots and airplanes both on the ground and in the air. This is obvious right? Well yes it is obvious but it's also very difficult to comprehend and appreciate. This film doesn't show heroes or heroic deeds it shows people in difficult situations. This movie is not about pilots and planes but about what those pilots and planes represent. The symbolism of the film is very subtle but it is this very subtlety that makes it so strong and compelling when it finally hits you! Slowly as is intended you get to see the greatness of this film and the gravity of its themes. Like in Tolstoy's War and Peace the true genius is not in the description of banal dinner parties or whatever but in the way all of this normal interaction is shown to be a facade through a careful elaboration of the underlying themes. A huge kudos to the script which is an exercise in humanity and subtlety.This marvelous ability of the film to be read on many levels at once  literal and allegorical  is what makes it such a pleasure to watch at least for the most part. The pacing may be difficult yes but the payoff is immense. It reminds me a little of David Lynch's The Straight Story where the simplicity of the plot is what makes it so good. The bottom line you don't need to think about Camus Ozu or Ghost in the Shell to appreciate this film.

	onyx:emotionText "Imagine an animation whose driving metaphor is the sky bustling with clouds and fighter planes. I would bet you are already thinking of adjectives like action and fastpaced to describe such a film. Well think again.In fact Mamoru Oshii's latest feature film is surprisingly lowkey. Fans of his previous work will not be disappointed but even those familiar with his typical moody antics and his meandering selfreflective style from movies like Ghost in the Shell or Avalon may find the pace of this film hardgoing. Characters are distant and understated. Places are remote and static. Action is fleeting and almost random. Dialogue is sparse and vague. All of this makes for a challenging experience.How though does it pay off? How does the film pull it off? Well it is difficult to explain this without either giving too much away or saying far too little but the main point is perfectly understandable without any spoilers The salvaging fact of the movie is its logical progression towards perfect explication of its premises towards perfect selfexplanation. This film pays off wonderfully towards the end. The way it does it is being faithful to its own pace and rhythm. Yes characters may be understated  but for a reason. Yes places are remote  but for a reason. And on and on so it goes... There will be a moment when everything just clicks into place. The serenity and straightforwardness of the film is also its greatest strength. It is like a long algebraic expression that crunches away slowly in the background but ultimately overwhelms the viewer in a Heureka! moment. For a film that starts opaque everything becomes transparent by the end. It doesn't rely on tricks or cheating the audience. It is a perfectly honest and also perfectly brutally realist film. It makes explicit references to Camus and this makes sense in the context of the classically existentialist questions the movie raises. For its theme and mood it feels very European and American it even features quite a bit of English dialogue and there's no Japanese cutesyness in the film. It is a very serious and mature movie in a way that combines the best of both European literature and Japanese culture.Despite its universal and abstract nature and despite its stylized alternative American backdrop the best reference point for the style of the film is the cinema of the masters of Japanese understatement Yasujir Ozu and Akira Kurosawa. Indeed the movie's subtle aesthetic eye belongs to the tradition of the Japanese outlook on life crystallized in the concept of mono no aware translatable as transience of things. If the movie is existentialist it is so in a way that only a Japanese film can be. The movie then is very Japanese and very universal. It combines realism with symbolic and sciencefiction elements in a way that is reminiscent of the equally slowpaced spiritual materialism of the master director Andrei Tarkovsky.So Sky Crawlers succeeds because it starts out with banally normal situations and people but by the end increasingly problematizes its own deceptive normalcy and shows the underlying tensions bubbling under the calm surface. In other words the film is both straightforward and complex both obvious and difficult both downtoearth and transcendent. This contrast between ground and air is in a very obvious way incorporated into the plot  it is after all a movie about pilots and airplanes both on the ground and in the air. This is obvious right? Well yes it is obvious but it's also very difficult to comprehend and appreciate. This film doesn't show heroes or heroic deeds it shows people in difficult situations. This movie is not about pilots and planes but about what those pilots and planes represent. The symbolism of the film is very subtle but it is this very subtlety that makes it so strong and compelling when it finally hits you! Slowly as is intended you get to see the greatness of this film and the gravity of its themes. Like in Tolstoy's War and Peace the true genius is not in the description of banal dinner parties or whatever but in the way all of this normal interaction is shown to be a facade through a careful elaboration of the underlying themes. A huge kudos to the script which is an exercise in humanity and subtlety.This marvelous ability of the film to be read on many levels at once  literal and allegorical  is what makes it such a pleasure to watch at least for the most part. The pacing may be difficult yes but the payoff is immense. It reminds me a little of David Lynch's The Straight Story where the simplicity of the plot is what makes it so good. The bottom line you don't need to think about Camus Ozu or Ghost in the Shell to appreciate this film. Even if it's not exactly easy entertainment it works on the surface level of science fiction anime. I mean it's simple some would say banal it's lowkey boring it's marvelously atmospheric slooow. All those qualifications can be read as good or bad signs but if you're willing to invest a bit of time and effort into digesting the theme and message of the movie you will be glad you did so because Mamoru Oshii has given us another masterwork of adult animation.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mamoru Oshii's newest film utterly confounded most of the people around me at tonight's New York Screening. There was lots of What the hell was thats and I liked it up to the end's which was really not the end because Oshii appeared in a recorded message welcoming us to the New York premiere saying a few words about the film and admonishing us to stay to the end which he didn't specify as after the end credits where a five minute sequence takes placeso half the audience was gone by the time it ranand yes it alters things. The main message Oshii gave us was that the film is about children who are pilots who don't grow up.This is the story of a world thats like our own but different. Its a place where corporations seem to control everything and everyone is engaged in a war that is actually more like a national game. Fighting the war are the eternally young kildren young adults who never age and who can die it seems if they do so in combat. Into this mix or rather to an outpost of four planes comes a new pilot a nice young man who seems to feel he remembers being here before. Of course he's wrong but everything is a blur.I don't know how much more to tell you. the story that spins out from one of the most incredible sky battle action sequences put on film is something that really needs to be seen on its own terms to be truly appreciated. What I can say is that the flying sequences rendered in hyper realistic animation is amazing. They are the reason to see the film on a movie screen preferably a BIG movie screen if you get the chance. Its truly amazing. They are utterly beautiful...and terrifying.I have to make it clear the sky sequences are not what the film is about. the film is about the pilots and their commander who face the day to day existence of getting by and fighting a war. The film deals with the daily grind of the people involved and you get to feel what their lives are like. At the same time the film is very deliberately paced. the film is what could be best described as slow. I didn't mind but some people around me did wanting to know why there wasn't more action. Actually the action is almost an after thought or away of punctuating themes and ideas Oshii has running around in his head. This is not a film of physical motion but of intellectual.What the people around me didn't seem to grasp was that this is a film by Mamoru Oshii who may have made Ghost in the Shell but he's also made some other really wild and trippy films about the nature of reality memory what it is to be human and other ideas. As an intellectual work the film is firing on all cylinders. Oshii has made a film that is about all of that and more including the nature of war and the world. The action is secondary to the human story since the human story is where all of the meat is. The story of the new guy slowly morphs moving in to several other directions including a mystery of sorts the solution of which may appear to be obvious but it raises other more intriguing themes like who are we really I don't dare mention some of the others since to fully explore them will reveal major pot points.In my humble opinion this is a great film. The friend and I who went with me to see the film began talking as soon as the film really ended and we didn't stop talking about it until I left him on the train almost three hours later. Yes there were other subjects discussed during that three hours but we kept coming back to the film he liked it but didn't love it however he agreed that there is something to the film because it forces you to be engaged in a dialog about it. Not only does Oshii discuss big ideas but there are so many plot points and world points that are thrown out there that are never resolved that you can just keep pondering what happens at times. If you like films that you think about and argue about and which go their own way you will love this movie.Let me be honest I doubt most people are going to like this film. I don't know if most people are going to get this film. I think most people are going to wonder why there is not more action and why its so slow. I know the people around me were wondering if that was it as if the lack of a clear resolution especially when they didn't stay through the credits some how made the film something less then it was. I liked the lack of complete closure since it allowed my mind to wonder besides you can see how the story may continueIf you can take the film on its own terms and take it for the film of ideas it is I think you'll like the film possibly even love it. Don't fight it. And do stay through the end credits since whats there is important think of the credits as a natural break which frankly it is it is one of the few films I've ever seen where the final sequence needs to be there it needs the break of several minutes to function as it does. One of the better best? films of the year.".

And those who don't will probably complain about poor animation and too much talking.Actually the story is a lot more straightforward as far as Oshii is ever 'straightforward' than Innocence but the world presented here is quite a tricky one to get your head around if you start thinking too much about it. And of course half the fun of an Oshii movie is thinking too much...If you liked Jin Roh you'll probably like this.So anyway the world It's kind of Europe. It's sort of WWII. But then again it's kind of science fiction too. But actually it's not any of these. It's a fantasy world which exists firmly in Oshii's mind neither postapocalyptic farfuture nor alternative history.So there's this group of Japanese pilots fighting for a free world some unspecified enemy the other team in what appears to be England then maybe Poland on what they call the European NORTHERN front according to the JapaneseEnglish newspapers and of course the colour TV reports in the American style diner they hang out in... You get the idea. It's a weird mix of nostalgic wartime imagery. In a world which seems to have no national borders where everything is run by corporations.After an initial exciting CG action scene with really cool engine noises if ya like that sort of thing  and Oshii obviously does! the characters are presented. The 2D animation is quite a shock at first after the smooth CG. It doesn't quite fit. But then again lots of things 'don't quite fit' in this movie. It's one of the main themes. Oshii keeps introducing strange things about his world throughout while characters muse on the meaning of life and stuff as Oshii characters are want to do.What's real? What's not? Why are we here? and refreshingly Let's not worry too much about it and go bowling.There are several revelations about the world the characters inhabit but it never gets too confusing and Oshii allows you to figure things out for yourself as the movie progresses at its own slow pace I don't need to point out that Oshii's movies tend to be quite a bit slower than usual anime do I?. And just in case you need some confirmation about part of the mystery there's a final shot after the end credits which kind of sums up.It's probably best not to read too much about the plot.

In fact the film is rated PG13 primarily for smoking. Instead Sky Crawlers has a very quiet reserved pacing. Its a two hour anime that feels like it clocks in at over three hours. Not boring per se but very deliberately paced with adult conversations adult music and an overall adult tone that reminds one of Before Sunrise with occasional airborne dogfight to break up the relationship introspection.The plot is both light I will reveal that here and quite heavy I will let the movie itself surprise you with its philosophical underpinnings. On the light side is there is a special group of teenagers who are pilots that never grow old. The movie refers to them as Kildren and much is made of how they are just kids but if you drive fly have sex drink and smoke a pack every 10 minutes of screen time your are at best a teen and in reality a young adult.These Kildren fight in retro WW2 style aircraft against each other in an air war with no winners and no other casualties all to apparently satiate the publics need for conflict. Think Star Treks A Taste of Armageddon. There is a new pilot a wingman and a couple of androgynous love interests with deep secret pasts. There is even a Red Baron character rumored to be an adult and a constant source of tension and conversation in both the dogfights and on the ground.The Animation is simply awe inspiring. The CGI work is better than many a Hollywood blockbuster and the 2 dimensional cell shaded characters fit both the pacing and the mood of the film. The attention to detail is quite amazing overall.Overall the film is recommended for fans of adult drama and serious anime. I do confess I did wish for longer sky battles more realistic violence and even some fan service. It is ironic that one of the most adult anime I have ever seen suffers from a lack of adult thrills with its PG13 rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit it was difficult to get into the right mood to watch Sky Crawlers. I was expecting one thing a war film and while there were moments of that I found myself confronted with a world full of characters with human concerns and a strict atmosphere that called upon the audience to pay attention to the details. Having watched and enjoyed other films by Oshii this one most resembling Avalon in tone and theme I knew that I'd be in for something demanding and stoic but I was also surprised by just how initially uncharismatic the two main characters were. However as the film progressed I found myself drawn in by their mysterious histories and eventually deeply sympathizing with their tragedy. To explain the nature of the pilots is to spoil the film but rest assured every frustration and question you have concerning the characters is answered by the end just make sure you sit through the end of the credits! However whether or not you are satisfied in the end is another question entirely. While the chaotic crowdpleasing dogfights and strikingly rendered landscapes are sure to get a rise out of any audience the mystery of the characters themselves is initially impenetrable and unwelcoming.On the other hand Oshii's depiction of emotionally mature personally tortured characters is a unique landmark in animation. While there have been other animated films concerned with serious character drama few of them have chosen to completely eschew melodrama with the exacting discipline of this film.The film strikes a strange balance between frenetic action scenes and serious character exploration. It won't please everyone. But if you enter Sky Crawlers with an open mind you may find something exciting brutal and heartbreaking here.".

I was expecting one thing a war film and while there were moments of that I found myself confronted with a world full of characters with human concerns and a strict atmosphere that called upon the audience to pay attention to the details. Having watched and enjoyed other films by Oshii this one most resembling Avalon in tone and theme I knew that I'd be in for something demanding and stoic but I was also surprised by just how initially uncharismatic the two main characters were. However as the film progressed I found myself drawn in by their mysterious histories and eventually deeply sympathizing with their tragedy. To explain the nature of the pilots is to spoil the film but rest assured every frustration and question you have concerning the characters is answered by the end just make sure you sit through the end of the credits! However whether or not you are satisfied in the end is another question entirely. While the chaotic crowdpleasing dogfights and strikingly rendered landscapes are sure to get a rise out of any audience the mystery of the characters themselves is initially impenetrable and unwelcoming.On the other hand Oshii's depiction of emotionally mature personally tortured characters is a unique landmark in animation. While there have been other animated films concerned with serious character drama few of them have chosen to completely eschew melodrama with the exacting discipline of this film.The film strikes a strange balance between frenetic action scenes and serious character exploration. It won't please everyone. But if you enter Sky Crawlers with an open mind you may find something exciting brutal and heartbreaking here.";

They're layered and have back stories that propel them forward in the story and brings the viewer into their world.The animation is amazing throughout. The art is gorgeous. The plane fights were amazing. Each time a dogfight began my heart would be racing and i'd be concerned for the characters involved. The music is very Mamoru Oshii. It felt a little odd but did seem to fit well enough that it didn't distract me from what i saw.The pacing was skewed wrong. At times it felt subtle slow and decisive with the characters which is fine in it's own right but when you open with an explosive dogfight you leave the subtle approach coming off as sluggish. I would have preferred the character scenes to move a little faster and to be presented more aggressively.The ending is left me disjointed however it fits the mood of the film so i won't count that against it.The Sky Crawlers is a beautiful and touching experience that's among the best of the year.

The concept of Killdre who can't won't? become adults were also quite interesting but I felt they could've done much more with this story.Throughout the film the main character repeated that there were no reason to become adults but what was the real difference between childhood and adulthood? Children and their immaturity come from inexperience. Even if their bodies never grew up wouldn't their minds continue to grow into an adult? I wish they had explained this more because the Killdre pilots in this movie didn't behave that different compared to adult pilots. To me it seemed like being children had no real advantages other than better reflexes and lighter weight for the planes.They did a fine job with the revival problems of Killdre that they can't escape the war even through death but I wished they focused more on the subject.Animation on this was quite disastrous in my opinion. In this day and age many anime series mix 3DCGI and traditional cel animation. This style of animation never worked for me since the handdrawn cel animation seems like laziness behind 3D backgrounds especially since there were many 'frozen' frames where a character don't move for about 5 seconds. Such wide gap in animation quality within an anime movie seems unnatural and I believe the CG technology in Japan has not reached a convincing level in anime yet. Some plane fight scenes were quite cool but the following cel animation in the base always seemed awkward afterwards.Truly great animated films in recent years like Byousoku 5cm and reputable anime studios like Ghibli and Mad House still use computer graphics only to assist the handdrawn special effects without using protrusive 3DCGI in 2dimensional background or characters. Japanese anime creators need to wait until they have enough budget and technology to match current Pixar films before using CGI in their anime films.I really liked the character development in this movie but I believe this film had a lot of space for improvements.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sky Crawlers is directed by Mamoru Oshii the 56yearold genius director. He lets go of the screenplay this time and presents a fresh front by introducing a new scriptwriter Chihiro Ito.The most anticipated aspect of this film for fans of Hiroshi Mori the author of the original novel is how the director has translated the original into the medium of film. The original is like a poem where you can clearly see his vision with a lots of space in the sentences. It's also a challenge to decide on what extend the truth of the story is to be visible which was less clear in the original novel.KillDren  Living weapons which never grew up kept as adolescents their entire lives and created to show people a performance called a war.Once again the film treats the dominant theme of the conflict between humans and AI made by humans. However the story has an appeal which is different from Ghost In The Shell or Innocence.Humans who do not know about wars breeding killing people depriving family or being full of hatred. They wish for peace and exhausted by all the efforts which end in endless tragedy and death. The wars as a form of entertainment is a way to look directly at such concepts and is a way to create a distance from such tragedies. The wars what make them recognise once more what they are truly happy about by peeping at this extreme hopelessness.Certainly humans are greedy creatures and they expect that the safe and peaceful situation will continue and this would be fine without knowing whether they are truly happy. They still want to their further happiness because they are not satisfied with this situation. It is the moment that they realise they are actually happy by recognising the position where they stand at the hierarchy of the society they live in and comparing it with others. It is through having wars as entertainment that people venture to create.Meanwhile there are girls and boys who only find their lives worth living in the sky laughing in the sky crying in the sky and killing other people using their right hands as Living weapons. KillDren who love people become puzzled with the truth have some self confidence and sometimes are fragile. It is the same life as normal adolescent girls and boys except they are weapons and never grow.This is a story which tells us about what the truly important things in life are and to see them living in our world and time.Notes Please watch till the end of the story even after the ending credit starts. The last scene will give you a hint to the secret of the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just watched the movie using Crackle on my Xbox 360.To be honest I thought this movie would involve a lot of blood and fighting. But actually not at all the majority of it involved conversations between characters. The fight scenes that did happen were entertaining however especially the opening one. I'll also admit that I initially thought that The Teacher was the main character. That part was confusing for me.I couldn't really see a clear storyline. The plot summary on Crackle was short and not informative so I had a hard time gathering information and putting it together.Characters were uninteresting at best. Everyone seemed 'cryptic' in nature. By that I mean they seemed to lack a personality. I never like that sort of thing. I enjoy seeing characters that express their personality and when there's none to express it gets boring really fast. This is one of the most beautifullyanimated movies I've ever seen. Realistic explosions and movements especially the props on the aircraft were pleasing to the eye. No bright or vibrant colors were used but somehow I found that appealing.If I were to improve this movie I'd add more fight scenes the battle between Kannami and The Teacher especially and take out a lot of the conversations. One key scene that I thought about for a while was the bombing attack  I seriously disliked that they didn't show the bombing the interceptors or how they botched the job.".

	schema:headline " Toxic Futures";
	schema:reviewBody "The near future. Humanity has achieved some semblance of peace. To remind the masses of pain and suffering and to inject wonder gratitude and emotion into a world that has long calloused into apathy multinational corporations stage elaborate wars fought by cloned fighter pilots called Kildren. The corporations are named after German football teams. The Kildren do not age and remain in a state of perpetual adolescence.The Sky Crawlers was directed by Mamourou Oshii who cites Michelangelo Antonioni and Andrei Tarkovsky as influences. His film begins with Yuichi Kannami one of many fighter pilot Kildren arriving at a military installation. Everyone at the installation knows that Yuichi is simply a clone who's been assigned to them and died countless times before but they nevertheless treat him as a real human being. It is a charade they're tired of maintaining.Why bother to grow up if I'm going to die? Yuichi says early in the film the line encapsulating his indifference to all things. Unfazed by the possibility that he may be bioengineered a machine created for virtually no purpose Yuichi spends his days drinking beer playing war games having sex and lazing about. He never questions who he is why he's on the island or why he fights. He has no memory of what came before now and little regard for what will come next.Towards the end of the film Yuichi begins to develop some modicum of selfawareness. Seeking a kind of Sartrean authenticity and desperate to end the charade he is caught up in he takes to the skies. He is then mercilessly shot down by a fighter pilot called the teacher. The following day wait until the end of the credits another clone of Yuichi appears at the military base. It then becomes apparent that each clone is destroyed or commits suicide prior to attaining selfawareness. For the Kildren ignorance is bliss.The film is philosophically heavy Oshii swimming in waters routinely visited by Antonioni. Today in Japan an estimate one million youths or roughly one percent of the population are classified as hikikomori which literally means being confined. These are youths who have sequestered themselves in family homes and have little contact with the outside world. Having given up on the idea of being a contributing member of society these youths either remain unemployed or work in menial jobs embracing stagnation and self medicating themselves with various postindustrial creature comforts. In addition to this the number of students dropping out of school in Japan has doubled since 1990 and women are increasingly going on womb strikes refusing to have children. With this comes a shrinking work force and a fall in birth rates. An entire chunk of Japan no longer wishes to live.While many believe the hikikomori to be social misfits or psychologically damaged it is better to think of them as an early warning signal. Like coal mining canaries which were once used to detect toxic gasses the hikikomori are a red flag sensitive individuals who sense that something is wrong and so retreat to the wombs of their bedrooms to escape from a society they view as being toxic.Much literature has been written about the hikikomori but their existence essentially boils down to one thing Japan is the world's first true postmodern nation. What you have in Japan is a conflict between East and West between group and individual between modernity and postmodernity. It is a country caught within a web of diametrically opposed forces forces which are pressure cooked because of several relatively unique factors.So on one hand you have a country cocooned by walls of water. A country with a fixed national identity heavy immigration restrictions a rigid school curriculum a homogeneous ideology a society built on strong social mores honour tradition hard work loyalty groupism specific aesthetics a hierarchical structure emphasising the inequality between persons etc etc. And on the other hand you have a country which no longer believes in the myth of Progress. Which suffers the atomization of the family the rampant feminization of men which now heavily borrows and models itself after Western culture and which in the wake of the economic boom of the 1980s finds the pursuit of material extravagance to deliver emptiness rather than inner contentment.Of course existential questions of meaningfulness and identity traditionally crop up in wealthy societies as man's focus shifts from selfpreservation to introspection. But Japan goes beyond this. Postmodernity is epitomised by relational identities a loss of absolutes and widespread fragmentation. It abolishes the idea of fixed essences and leaves individuals to construct identities by appropriating from vapid but always shifting cultural and ethnic positions. End result today the essence of the Japanese is to have no essence a stance which the hikikomori feebly rebel against.So at its core The Sky Crawlers is about a society of youths caught in limbo refusing to grow up because they have nothing to live for. Stuck in stasis they become increasingly infantilized soothing their pain with vices like anime which in this film takes the form of staged or theatrical wars fought by actors. Oshii in other words attacks the anime industry itself an industry in which the same old thing is repeated ad infinitum all with the same interchangeable boy pilot avatars. Resentful of a dead creative environment see Children Of Men in which the future is literally sterilized he urges his hero and audience to escape and strive towards something. Interestingly this pursuit is seen to be suicidal. Dedicating the body to a cause is itself the decision to erode the body for that cause.Many complain that the film is too slow even its dog fights are made banal but those familiar with Antonioni will be at home here. The film isn't slow so much as it is beautifully nauseous. It's Antonioni's Red Desert with fighter jets.8.910  Flawed masterpiece. See The Tin Drum.".

This film is nearly unbearable and it elicited cheers from me and my two friends when the credits started to roll apparently there's another sequence postcredits but I'm not sorry I missed it.

I'm not a huge fan of Mamoru Oshii but I loved the job he did on Ghost In The Shell 1 and 2 as well as Patlabor 2 in a lesser way.

It's far too slow the characters are quiet boring plus the character design looks so poor compared to the CGI it's just not fitting at all. There is a lot of static shots with pretty much nothing to think about. Okay they give you some of the reasons why it was so slow all the way long nearly at the end but my point is that it's too late! It's not like I jumped off my seat I was actually quite disappointed so long for this! And what do I care? It's not like after 2 hours I really got attached to any of the characters... It just barely saves the movie.I understand it could work very well for the graphic novel wouldn't get this issue with the different styles plus you can read it at your own rhythm and go back for another reading after the big revelation at the end but here I just got the proof from Oshii himself that one cannot adapt everything to animated movies or movies. Sometimes it's just impossible. A movie HAS to entertain and not only for the last 5 minutes.".

Unfortunately the script is not good enough to make us understand or at least care about HP's bad and confusing choices during this 104 minutes. He makes weird and stupid decisions over and over again and it is just irritating...! The interhuman relations in this story are in addition badly reproduced. HP and Makker HP and Mette HP and Marco HP and his dead father... We don't get the feeling that he is close to any of them and yet their relation is supposed to mean more than what the film is able to express. Another thing that is weird are scenes where people start shouting to each other without any obvious reason... People can get caught in the moment and engaged in a discussion of course but two men yelling at each other in a blockapartment still seems weird when you see it onscreen. Difficult to explain it just seemed a bit... off. The action scenes is not at all bad. Norwegian film is definitely improving on this aspect. Nicolai Cleve Broch is a great actor and he is convincing in his role as HP but his character is not nuanced enough. I blame the script cause he has already proved that he can manage this ambivalence in Uno. Ane Dahl Torp is okay as Mette but doesn't give much extra to the film. Ahmed Zeyan as Marco is also okay but none of them blows me away. Ingar Helge Gimle as Makker is all wrong!".

The only bad thing we get to know about HP is that he punched one of his teachers in the face and then took off to another town. And in this lays some of the problem with the film. Although the movie tries to portray HP as a troublemaker who ignores the rules and his comrades because he believes it's the right thing to do it only makes him look like part partyboypart emokid. It also makes him look incredible stupid since he'd probably get permission to do what he's doing IF he'd told his superiors and makes us wonder how he could ever get into the police academy the real one not the movie one.The other problems is that the scenes never take this movie to the next level. The sad parts aren't really that sad the gritty part's aren't that gritty and the funny parts.. well there aren't really any funny parts. It might have saved the film if HP had walloped in sin and drugs. He takes a few shots of cocaine and have sex with the drug lords drug addicted daughter but that's about it. The movie tries to be black and grim but ends up gray and flat.The paradox of the movie is that the acting is pretty good but the film is not. Nicolai Cleve Broch makes a good effort with HP's limited character and both Ane Dahl Torp and Ahmed Zeyan does solid performances. The best portrayed character is by Ingar Helge Gimle as Makker HP's boss. Whereas HP is gray and lifeless Makker is full of emotion and life. You can really feel his frustration when HP doesn't follow his plan for him.To sum this up I say good acting poor camera and scriptwriting. A total of 5 out of 10 stars.".

Agnes is on location in East Berlin and Jochen her husband works at the Westend Theater in West Berlin. They hold diametrically opposed views on politics art and the responsibility of the individual to society. As they have vehement arguments their marriage is in danger of breaking up. This film portrays numerous figures of contemporary German cultural and political lifeincluding Veit Harlan director of the notorious Nazi propaganda film Jud Sss and Boleslaw Barlog a famous West Berlin theater director. Also memorable in this film is documentary footage of the construction of Stalin Allee the biggest boulevard built in East Berlin after WWII soon to become a central locus of the popular uprising of 17 June 1953. Although director Kurt Maetzig depicts Cold War Berlin with dramatic verve the film illustrates the tightening grip of Stalinism on East German cultural production at this time.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very amusing love story with a good dash of humor. Much of the humor centers around the culture clash between Standish and the 18th century family. Standish uses modern terms and slips when he reveals things that happen in the future. The culture clash is a cautionary tale for would be travelers. This film appealed to many women because Leslie Howard was a heart throb for many of them. My mother loved this film and could watch it over and over. She was so disappointed when late in her life it disappeared from the old movies shown on TV.It is currently not commercially available but a number of vendors have poor quality CDs or tapes for sale. All of these were probably made from a VHS tape from a TV showing. The tape was deteriorated and possibly copied several times so there is a lot of instability and wiggling of the image. The original broadcast used extreme compression of the video and sound. As a result the noise level rises to become very loud until dialog causes the gain to be cut. As a result the dialog is sometimes very indistinct. The music which was originally soft also rises to match the level of the dialog. Once this is restored by hand the film is fairly listenable. The complaint of another reviewer about the music being too loud may stem from watching a copy with similarly compressed sound. In addition the broadcast severely cropped the film and did not stabilize the jitter.This is a film that deserves restoration from the existing prints but when and if this happens is unknown. Until then buying one of the existing CDs may be the only way to view this fine film.".

She seemed to come along at the right time to be a successor to Janet Gaynor but Fox didn't bother much about her after a role in a forgotten Charlie Chan movie Charlie Chan's Greatest Case 1933. She did have some interesting moments in Springtime for Henry and The Mystery of Edwin Drood but after that her career just ambled along until she found a place as Phyllis Clavering in the Bulldog Drummond series.Peter Standish Leslie Howard is a wealthy American traveler who unbeknownst to him is about to be hooked into matrimony by an impoverished Regency family the Pettigrews whose son has spent the family fortune on wine women and cards. Just as he arrives a fearful storm breaks out and .......................Marjorie Frant Betty Lawford who looked a lot older than 23! is very concerned about her fianc Peter Standish  he keeps to his room and is obsessed by his ancestor Peter Standish. He has inherited the house in Berkeley Square that the original Peter Standish owned and spends his time pouring over a diary that tells him all the little details about the family and London life in the 1780s  especially Helen who seems to have a secret sorrow and never marries. Walking back to his house during a storm and arriving at exactly 5.30 he is suddenly whisked back in time to 1785 and the intrigue that is going on at the Pettigrews!! He is so determined to do the right thing to let events take their course without changing the course of history but he bumbles from the start. Almost proposing to Kate on their first meeting he knows from the diary that Peter marries Kate to revealing Helen's birthday gift a beautiful shawl before the box is opened!!!Peter feels like a stranger in a strange land but also senses a kindred spirit in Helen who seems to understand he is not in his own time. I thought it was a touching romantic fantasy with many scenes that bought tears to my eyes. When Helen looks into Peter's eyes and sees the future of the world she is instantly repelled and cannot be coaxed by him to return to the future with him. She convinces him to go back and wait until they can both be reunited in the hereafter. Her speech is very eloquent. The original play by John L. Balderstone who also wrote the screen play was much more grittier  Standish was very disillusioned with the past he was appalled by the squalor and poverty by the horror of public hangings. In the movie John astounds everyone by insisting on a daily bath!!! So Helen's seeing the future through John's eyes which couldn't have worked on the stage was a way to give the movie an added dimension.Alan Mowbray had a small role as Peter's friend and Beryl Mercer played what she played best sweet little cockneys.I just loved this movie but can only give it 9 out of 10 because the soundtrack was very scratchy and the picture quality was very grainy. The play Berkeley Square opened on Broadway in 1929 and ran for a respectable 229 performances. The plot was suggested by a Henry James short story The Sense of the Past.Highly Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although this version of Berkeley Square was little more than a photographed stage play it does have Leslie Howard portraying Peter Standish as he did on Broadway for 229 performances during the 19291930 season. No other member of the cast repeated their roles. I have to say that the Tyrone Power version from 1951 was and is more cinematically viable.That being said Leslie Howard was doing a part that was tailor made for him. He's a jaded American scientist who is firmly convinced that he is at some point in time destined to change places with an ancestor also named Peter Standish from the 18th century post American Revolution Great Britain.When he gets there he mixes and mingles with high and mighty of the day like the Prince Of Wales Dr. Samuel Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. And he knows things that others don't and uses all kinds of modern in this case 1928 idioms that first amuse then frighten.He's in fact pledged to one woman but falls in love with her sister played by Heather Angel something he did not count on. It's almost like a trip to Fantasy Island where Mr. Rourke has arranged a trip to the Age of Reason. Usually those trips to some idealized place in history involved a cruel dose of reality as well and in Berkeley Square Leslie Howard gets just such a dose.Howard and Angel are a wonderfully matched pair of lovers who will meet some day in time and space and know it. Howard earned his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor the second coming with Pygmalion. Had Berkeley Square been better cinematically it probably would be more revived. As it is it's a great performance by Leslie Howard one his legion of fans should treasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Leslie Howard proves once again that he was the matine idol women adored long before he was unwillingly cast as Ashley Wilkes in Gone with the Wind a role he hated to play.He gives a very forceful performance here as a young man who is fascinated by his ancestry and somehow transports himself to an earlier era with unhappy consequences he couldn't have expected when events turn against him.Heather Angel makes a good impression she and Howard both starred in the Broadway stage version but the tale itself is much too talky for the screen and would have benefited from a wider use of outdoor scenes to take away some of the stagebound feeling. An unusual feature is the almost constant flow of background music in an era when most soundtracks were only punctuated by dialog without musical effects.

	onyx:emotionText "Leslie Howard proves once again that he was the matine idol women adored long before he was unwillingly cast as Ashley Wilkes in Gone with the Wind a role he hated to play.He gives a very forceful performance here as a young man who is fascinated by his ancestry and somehow transports himself to an earlier era with unhappy consequences he couldn't have expected when events turn against him.Heather Angel makes a good impression she and Howard both starred in the Broadway stage version but the tale itself is much too talky for the screen and would have benefited from a wider use of outdoor scenes to take away some of the stagebound feeling. An unusual feature is the almost constant flow of background music in an era when most soundtracks were only punctuated by dialog without musical effects.

	schema:reviewBody "In adapting his own stage play 'Berkeley Square' for the screen playwright John L Balderston made numerous changes. One change is significant in hindsight during Act One of the stage play the dialogue makes several references to a war hero named Bill Clinton! A hero on the side fighting AGAINST the United States. In the film this British officer is merely identified as Major Clinton and there are no mentions of his heroics.Leslie Howard everyone's definitive Englishman was actually English only by a fluke his parents were Hungarian Jews who moved to London shortly before his birth. In the film version of 'Berkeley Square' Howard portrays two Americans  one from the 18th century one from the present  but his accent and demeanour in both roles are quintessentially English. Howard had previously starred on Broadway in this story but in the stage play he portrayed only the modernday Peter Standish who journeys into the past his namesake ancestor swapping places with him in the present remained offstage.Here we have the fantasy about a modern American who contrives to switch places in time with his 18thcentury ancestor both men are named Peter Standish and are physically identical. This is unlikely the medical dental and nutritional standards in 1784 would have kept that century's Standish looking very different from his descendant. Apart from failing to convince me that he's American Howard gives an excellent performance in both roles. Soon enough Peter Standish acquires a touch of Peter Ibbetson as he falls in love with a woman who will die in 1787 more than a century before his own birth.The everreliable Samuel S. Hinds wearing a bizarre moustache here plays straight man to Howard in one fascinating scene in which Standish explains the difference between linear time and nonlinear time in the latter all the events in the universe are occurring simultaneously.Also quite excellent is Betty Lawford in an unsympathetic role. She wears some very chic gloves but also sports a bizarre fur collar that seems to be intended for a female impersonator. A transvestite linebacker could hide his shoulders inside there!As the doomed young lady of 18thcentury England Heather Angel has one memorable scene opposite the 18thcentury Standish's body possessed by his modern descendant. Staring into Standish's eyes she glimpses an amazing stockfootage montage of the chaos and mayhem of modern times. Her reaction is memorable.A story like this will have intentional anachronisms but I looked for unintentional errors. Here's one a string ensemble in 1784 perform Gossec's 'Gavotte' two years before he wrote it. Have another in the opening scene set in September 1784 Lionel Belmore reports that a French aeronaut has just flown from Dover to Calais Belmore mispronounces this name in a balloon. Actually that didn't happen until January 1785 the flight was in the opposite direction and there were two men one of them AngloAmerican in the balloon. In a later scene some English gentlemen give the word 'bathed' the wrong pronunciation yes I'm quite certain. The art direction is generally excellent except for a dodgy thunderstorm. And it's weird to encounter the term 'crux ansata' applied to what modern viewers know better as the Egyptian ankh.This film gets very much right a detail that many other period stories get wrong 'Berkeley Square' acknowledges that the past is a dirtier not cleaner place than the present.The single worst thing about 'Berkeley Square' is the overscored soundtrack practically every scene assaults the ears with loud background music when so much of this gentle fantasy would have worked better with no music at all. I was delighted that the character actress Beryl Mercer is much less annoying than usual here probably because for once she's been given no maudlin material. My rating for this gentle stately fantasy is 7 out of 10. For a much more romantic treatment of this premise with a different set of timetravel paradoxes I recommend a better movie 'Somewhere in Time'.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the earliest time travel films it concerns two men named Peter Standish both of whom are played by Leslie Howard. One lives in 1784 and the other his distant relative lives in 1933. The elder Peter longs to see the technological advances which will come after his death while the younger Peter seeks to escape the hustle and bustle of 1933 and experience the joys of a supposedly simpler time. The two men switch places and while in 1784 the younger Peter falls in law with Helen Pettigrew played by Heather Angel who is destined to be the elder Peter's sisterinlaw. Having had access to the elder Peter's diary in 1933 the younger Peter knows many little details of the Pettigrews' lives that the elder Peter did not yet know in 1784 and on several occasions makes the mistake of the mentioning them. He does the same when it comes to revealing his knowledge of more general events that have not happened yet and uses expressions like cockeyed and see you later that did not exist in the 18th Century. This leads people to fear him and the elder Peter's wouldbe wife Kate to break off the engagement as he believes that he has been possessed by a demon.Based on a 1929 Broadway play of the same name Howard reprised his roles as the two Peters and gave a wonderful performance as a temporal fish out of water whose experiences of the 18th Century lead him to view it as a filthy little pigsty of a world rather than romanticise it as he had done before his sojourn into the past. The elder Peter's experiences of the 20th Century are left unseen but the descriptions would seem to indicate that they were equally unpleasant not least because he was considered insane for claiming to be from 1784. Howard whom I had never seen in a film before and Heather Angel have wonderful chemistry and the younger Peter and Helen's gentle romance is certainly the highlight of the film. It has a very good cast overall including Valerie Taylor as Kate who likewise appeared in the Broadway play Irene Browne as her mother Lady Ann Pettigrew Colin KeithJohnston as her layabout brother Tom Ferdinand Gottschalk as Helen's far older suitor Mr. Throstle and Betty Lawford Peter's cousin as the younger Peter's fiance Marjorie Frant. The film is very well directed by Frank Lloyd probably best known for directing the 1935 version of The Mutiny on the Bounty.As the younger Peter scuppered his ancestor's chances of marrying Kate in 1784 it may be the first film in which time travel is used to alter the past  it was never stated outright that the younger Peter was a direct descendant of the elder one  but this is not made clear. The film was believed lost for many years until it was rediscovered in the 1970s which I am very happy about as I would obviously not have been able to see it otherwise. Incidentally I recently watched the excellent 1971 film Quest for Love which concerns a man who falls in love with a woman whom he meets in a parallel universe. One of the differences in that universe is that Leslie Howard is still alive and still acting. It may be only a coincidence but given the subject matter it could very well have been an oblique reference to this film.Overall this is a hugely enjoyable romantic fantasy film which reminds me of my tenth favourite film of all time Somewhere in Time due to its similar premise and bittersweet ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now I know why the chemistry of Leslie Howard worked so well in GWTW. He was most dashing! The attempt to portray time travel and it's fearful interpretations was impressive and laid the groundwork for Back to the Future and others as well.I enjoyed the peculiar moments of slip ups in modern for 1933 language and mannerisms in 1784 London. The actual transitions from one time to another was awkward but having limited expectations this presented no problem from an otherwise exciting plot.My biggest issue was the glimpse of our future with the wars speed violence and loud noise complimented with a grand finale fireworks display.

	onyx:emotionText "Now I know why the chemistry of Leslie Howard worked so well in GWTW. He was most dashing! The attempt to portray time travel and it's fearful interpretations was impressive and laid the groundwork for Back to the Future and others as well.I enjoyed the peculiar moments of slip ups in modern for 1933 language and mannerisms in 1784 London. The actual transitions from one time to another was awkward but having limited expectations this presented no problem from an otherwise exciting plot.My biggest issue was the glimpse of our future with the wars speed violence and loud noise complimented with a grand finale fireworks display.

He plays a currentday 1933 American man who yearns for the peace and quiet and beauty of the 18th century after he discovers some old papers and diaries in his ancestral house. He wishes so hard he is actually transported to 1784.Right off the bat he gets into trouble fitting into the rhythm and manners of 18th Century London ... and into the lives of his ancestors. The mother Irene Browne is trying to marry off two daughters Heather Angel Valerie Taylor to men with money one of whom is Howard's ancestor whose body he is now inhabiting.Knowing that he must not change history he walks a tightrope. He is not attracted to the woman his ancestor marries but he is attracted to her sister. But history dictates he must not marry her. He also keeps dropping words and phrases that make no sense in 1784 and he scares people by when he blurts out bits of information about things that have not yet happened.As he digs himself into a bigger hole every day he realizes that the woman he really loves Angel seems to shares his discontent for the age in which she is trapped. She longs for the future! Yet in one horrific moment she sees the future world in his eyes and it scares her. For his part he finally has to admit that the 18th Century is utterly horrible and that it actually stinks! People don't bathe the streets are full of horse manure.Leslie Howard is superb as the man torn between the past and his own time. He and Heather Angel make for a terrifically doomed couple and the scene when he returns in 1933 from her grave and read the epitaph carved into her headstone is quite moving.Costars include Juliette Compton as an arch and wily duchess Alan Mowbray as Clinton Ferdinand Gottschalk as the aged suitor Betty Lawford as the currentday girlfriend Beryl Mercer as the housekeeper and Samuel S.

He visits her moldering grave from times past. He wants to be with her in Eternity  together forever. Richard had the penny to bring him back to the future and Peter had the Ankh as a similar instrument. Richard had the pocket watch as the time loop instrument also that eerily appeared in his future and in his past. When Peter saw his future Ankh in the hands of his 18th Century girlfriend I thought Peter is now going to creepily be pulled back to the future like Richard did in Somewhere In Time. Peter went back and looked despondent just like Richard did in Somewhere in Time. Early in the Berkeley Square film I began seeing scenes that totally creeped me out because I instantly thought of Somewhere in Time and that its author Richard Matheson must have copied a lot from 1933's Berkeley Square. Just add into Somewhere in Time the reallife actress Maude Adams fictionalized as Elise McKenna and you have a maybe plagiarized film and novel Bid Time Return that Matheson supposedly dreamed up after he accidentally saw an old photograph of Maude Adams in Piper's Theatre from the Old American West. Matheson was a quite prolific writer including Twilight Zone.. Somewhere in Time was not really the true story of Maude Adams and it seemed to have quite a few of the elements from Berkeley Square. Both Elise and Helen figured that their boyfriends were from the future. Elise in the novel thought so and even in that film she was interested in time travel. Helen saw the future through Peter's eyes and a frightening future that it was. I thought that the Berkeley Square future montage of wars fighting and killing airplanes trains flappers gangsters etc. was quite clever scary and had fantastic special effects. I enjoyed seeing Irene Browne The Red Shoes and Beryl Mercer The Little Minister and The Little Princess in Berkeley Square. My wish is that Berkeley Square could have been in color. In that comparison Somewhere in Time wins by a landslide. Other connections and observations Now about that other time travel film The Time Machine. H.G. Wells finds Weena in another dimension and of course she cannot go back with him either. In The Blue Bird Shirley Temple visits her longdeceased grandparents. Finally not time travel but the film The Little Princess again played by Shirley has wonderful Beryl Mercer portraying Queen Victoria during the Boer War. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "DEATH KNOCKS TWICE is an excellent vehicle for both leading man Dean Reed in this film he reminds me of a cross between James Franciscus Tab Hunter and the preburnout JanMichael Vincent who plays a detective out to solve a murder and robbery while stumbling across other corrupt activities and for leading hunk Fabio Testi who opens the film with a seminude outdoor love scene and seems to play half the film without his shirt on. If Joe Dallesandro had begun his European career at this point he would have been great in this part but Testi plays a sulking hunk well too and here he is a spoiled painter who lives in a wonderful beachfront villa and sleeps with various women who meet untimely ends. The film may tend to introduce too many characters too soon and the mystery does not seem so mysterious in the initial reels but somehow the whole thing chugs along and becomes more exciting in its second half which features an excellent highspeed car chase on a wet winding country road and some exciting stunts from Reed. There is a superb allstar Eurotrash cast including Adolfo Celi Anita Ekberg Werner Peters Leon Askin Nadia Tiller and Ricardo Garrone the film was cowritten by his brother Sergio and direction is handled by the reliable German director Harald Philipp whose credits include some of my favorite films such as MANHATTAN NIGHT OF MURDER with George Nader as Jerry Cotton and RAMPAGE AT APACHE WELLS an adaptation of Karl May's novel THE OIL PRINCE starring Stewart Granger as Old Surehand and Pierre Brice as Winnetou. The feel of the film is halfway between some of the later German crime films of the Edgar Wallace cycle and some of the earlier protogiallo films of the mid and late 60s. One wonders if Dean Reed viewed this film as a critique of capitalistic decadence which it certainly is although that may be unintended or just a good leading role to give the Italian period of his acting career a shot in the arm. Either way he handles himself well looks great and has charisma to burn. DEATH KNOCKS TWICE the title will make sense when you see it is not a mustsee film but I'm glad I watched it again and the combination of director and stars make it desirable to the fan of European genrefilms. Also Dean Reed was not that prolific of an actor and some of his films have never circulated in Englishlanguage versions to my knowledge so anything that can be found is worth watching. My copy was taped off a TV station in Aruba back in the 1980's. A letterboxed restored version would certainly be welcome!".

	onyx:emotionText "DEATH KNOCKS TWICE is an excellent vehicle for both leading man Dean Reed in this film he reminds me of a cross between James Franciscus Tab Hunter and the preburnout JanMichael Vincent who plays a detective out to solve a murder and robbery while stumbling across other corrupt activities and for leading hunk Fabio Testi who opens the film with a seminude outdoor love scene and seems to play half the film without his shirt on. If Joe Dallesandro had begun his European career at this point he would have been great in this part but Testi plays a sulking hunk well too and here he is a spoiled painter who lives in a wonderful beachfront villa and sleeps with various women who meet untimely ends.

	schema:headline " Could have been interesting but lacks focus";
	schema:reviewBody "Death Knocks Twice is a somewhat interesting thriller that is often considered a part of the Giallo genre despite putting much of its focus on other areas of the plot which shows in a nutshell just how meandering this film is considering that a murder plot makes up the backbone of it. The film was made in 1969 just before the Giallo genre would gain popularity and Italian directors would go into overdrive making them. This one was actually a coproduction with West Germany thus further calling it's credibility with the genre into repute. The plot focuses on Francisco di Villaverde a talented artist who has a deadly hobby which involves strangling girls after having sex with them. He strangles a girl on the beach and this is witnessed by a couple of body guards who just so happen to work for a local gangster who just so happens to want to buy a piece of property owned by Francisco di Villaverde. This story is then fused with a love story between the artist and the gangster's wife as she can't resist his charms in spite of his murderous nature.The film gets off to a good start as we witness the central character murdering a woman on a beach...but from there it just peters out as we descend further into the plot. It loses focus as it goes on and the film quickly gets boring. In its favour the film does have three of the best stars of Italian cinema in its cast list. A young Fabio Testi takes the lead role and hints at the kind of performance that the charismatic actor would go on to give. The beautiful Anita Ekberg also appears as does one of the most underrated actors of cult Italian cinema the excellent Adolfo Celi. The film is directed by Harald Philipp and while he does capture some nice looking locations his direction in general is nothing fascinating and certainly not a patch on the likes of Dario Argento who would go on to make some of the best films of the genre. It all boils down to a decent conclusion but by then I couldn't really care what happened to be honest which is a bit of a shame. This is not an easy film to come by and I don't see any reason why that would change as it's not a particularly memorable entry.".

It doesn't help that our hero is a Roger Moore clone who doesn't seem to mind pimping out his wife as a potential murder victim although we do get some tense scenes involving her and Testi. Testi is good as the supposed killer artist and Adolfi Celli is also good as the old gangster who's possibly the cruellest person involved in the story. There's a really winceinducing part where he squeezes a guy's hand while the guy is holding a glass of whiskey with gory results. There's also a kind of lack of style here although on the other hand there is a 'trash' vibe that will become familiar during the next 300 Italian films I watch. I almost forgot to mention the subplot involving the dog that Roger Moore befriends which lends the latter part of the film a kind of 'Lassie' vibe which was kind of funny. Interest constantly waning during this one. Maybe I'm growing jaded of the giallo. Maybe not. Maybe it's because the kids are off school and won't go to bed the bastards.".

This building was also the Abrams Building during the time the U.S. military occupied it during the Cold War and anyone who was in Frankfurt in the 1970's or 1980's might recognise it as unchanged inside from the time the movie was made to the time one served in the Army. This film is rare because that was a secure building during much of the Cold War. Today I believe the Army has left the building and it is occupied by a school or college.Lots of history in this movie. I wish it was available on DVD.".

The location shots in bombed out Frankfurt and Berlin are rather startling and it's interesting to see the hatred and mistrust everyone has for the Germans. The movie is shot very well and the early scenes are excellent.Unfortunately the script is weak. Towards the end I realized that I just wasn't clear on why things were happening as they were. It felt like the plot was just a backdrop to the ambiance which was fine in the beginning but became a problem as the plot moved its wobbly self to center stage. I can't entirely blame the script though I think Tourneur's greatest failing as a director is that while he had a lot of style and could always make things interesting he could be sloppy in terms of telling a story. Of course he wasn't the only director who believed you could gloss over a lot if you just kept things moving but that works better with a good muddled script like The Big Sleep rather than the distinctly ordinary but muddled script he worked with here. Still worth seeing though.".

Such sentences as here justice arranged it so that the punishment were equal to the crime I'm not sure if the quote is correct but the idea is might corroborate that first impression.

The story line is incredibly muddled and held together in the early stages by a plodding voiceover that stops the flow of the film dead even before it starts. The first reel is almost entirely in French with the narrator explaining everything to us in mindnumbing detail including at one point informing us that '2145' is the European way of saying 9.45 pm. Eventually despite the narration a bunch international characters one from every Allied nation are assembled in the sleeper car of the Berlin Express of the title. I though at first the narration was a postproduction addon fix but then there is a long tracking shot down the train carriage where each of the characters is introduced to us by the narrator compartment by compartment which makes me think it was intended all along. It's such a laborious shot that it makes you think the movie is going to settle down to being a mystery on a train like The Lady Vanishes or Murder on the Orient Express. But no. There is a murder all right but everyone is quickly hauled off the train and the victim turns out to be a decoy for a real VIP and after a few brief scenes in an office no attempt is made to solve the assassination attempt.The assembled international types continue on their journey but before they can get on the train the VIP is kidnapped. They all break their schedules to hunt Frankfurt for the missing man and stumble over a set of 'clues' and coincidences that would make the writers of Murder She Wrote blush with shame for example our heroes go to a bar and see a girl smoking one of the VIP's special monogrammed cigarettes. She runs away so they talk to the GI she was sitting with. A few shots later he turns out to be a Nasty German in disguise  why? I mean why was he sitting around in a night club offlimits to Allied troops wearing an 'enemy' uniform. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Later our heroes though one of them also turns out to be a Nasty German find their man and save the day before reaching Berlin. More painful Narration as they drive past various bombed landmarks before arriving at the everso symbolic Brandenburg Gate. Then they all go their separate ways with a great show of international solidarity and hope for the future that is so painfully earnest and laboured it made me want to immediately start rebuilding the Berlin Wall.Having said all that there are a few good things in here. The clown is bizarrely weird  classic Tourneur. And the fight in the brewery tun was a memorable  the bad guy blasting down into the huge barrel lighting the trapped Ryan in brief flashes as he fired was a great moment. The performance of the man who betrays the VIP to his enemies is touching  the best acting in the whole movie. But as to who the bad guys were and why they were doing what they were doing I had no idea. I'm sure it mean well and full kudos for having a sympathetic Soviet Russian character. But all in all I found it a confusing mess.".

Be prepared for conscientious lectures conventional and dull about how life might be for us all if the U.S. Britain France and the Soviets could work together and be jolly doing it. Divided Germany right after WWII is the subject but we get the idea We all just need to be friends. An anonymous narrator keeps telling us this as well as pointing out what we're already seeing. It's no accident I think that Dore Schary supervised the making of this movie. If there was any possibility of pounding inspiring messages into an otherwise good movie Schary was the producer with the mallet. Imbedded like those oldtime prizes in clumps of stale sticky Cracker Jack are the good parts. These are worth digging for. We're in the middle of a Nazi plot to keep the victors from working together all to better the chances of these grubby but dangerous survivors of the Third Reich to divide and conquer. The humane Dr. Bernhardt a German who opposed Hitler and survived is on a mission from Paris to Berlin by train to address an international conference on his plans for a unified and democratic Germany. There's a plot to kill him. When a grenade on a snack tray goes off in Dr. Bernhardt's compartment...is it goodbye Dr. Bernhardt? Four travelers on the train strangers to each other find themselves thrown together with Lucienne Merle Oberon the doctor's secretary to find out what really happened. There's Robert Lindley Robert Ryan an agricultural expert from the U. S. Sterling Robert Coote a teacher from Britain who will work to develop Germany's education institutions Perrot Charles Korvin a Frenchman who was with the maquis and is now a businessman and Soviet Army lieutenant Maxim Kiroshilov Roman Toperow returning to the Soviet Union. Can they overcome differences to work together successfully in Berlin to learn the truth? Well sure. That's the whole point of the movie isn't it? Why is Berlin Express so good in parts? Most of the movie is set in the bombed out desolation of Berlin. It's a grim desperate place. The reality of Germany under the control of the occupying armies is clear. Cigarettes are the common currency useful for buying potatoes or bits of coal or if you're a G.I. women and liquor. Director Jacques Tournier gives us some firstrate tense scenes of interrogation hunts down rubblefilled streets at night a tawdry German nightclub in a ruined building a tacky mindreading act and impending violence in a cavernous bombedout brewery. You can't beat a dying clown for morbid interest and Tournier gives us a doozy with the clown in full costume a big smile painted on his face running and staggering down brickfilled streets bleeding from a bullet wound in his back and pursued by those intent on finishing him off. He has an effective death scene too in that nightclub. There's no sign of romance or even a spark or two between Merle Oberon and Robert Ryan just a bit of uneasy flirting. They raise the question what's the point of the two of them? Charles Korvin Coote and Toperow all do fine jobs. Reinhold Schunzel dominates his scenes as an aged friend of Dr. Bernhardt who learns too late that he made a terrible bargain. I suppose he's forgotten now at least in America but Schunzel was a fine actor. For raucous and corrupt good spirits put on Criterion's The Three Penny Opera 1931 and watch Schunzel as Tiger Brown pair off with Mack the Knife to sing KanonenSong The international intrigue parts of Berlin Express are just fine especially when we realize we'd better not trust just anyone. The laidon messages of international cooperation are unfortunately dull and heavyhanded. They slow down the plot appreciably whenever Dr. Bernhardt Lucienne or the narrator decide we need to be reminded of what the real purpose of the movie is. Still like the curate's egg parts of Berlin Express are tasty.".

	schema:reviewBody "Berlin Express 1948Just after WWII has ended comes this film about getting inside the postNazi world for an assassination. It's multinational and filled with bitter scenes of German ruin.This actually is an amazing film starting off and ending as beautiful and dramatic. And it's complex but luckily edited with precision. It's filmed with remarkable realism in postwar German Frankfurt and Berlin with trains and train stations and lots of darkness and steam and drama. Later there are huge areas of utter utter devastation. The first half hour has a stunning filmnoir style lots of angles deep shadows moving camera and so on all under the hand of master cinematographer Lucien Ballard. It's great to just watch.It's also a rare imperfect glimpse of what it might actually be like in that era where Germany was an occupied territory. It's almost shocking even now or maybe especially now since we have seldom seen anything remotely this vast and awful in a long time. That really is the depth of the movie that was intended and effective.The plot trying to save a German diplomat who is out for a peaceful future you might call a device and it is the weakness of it all even though they place much of the best of it on a train where the drama is classic train stuff car to car. There is also a lot of narration explaining rather well but still having to explain what is going on. Robert Ryan plays the leading man an American agriculture expert out to help recovery in Europe. There is also the expected stereotypingthe casual smart American the principled and arrogant Soviet the suspicious and duplicitous Germans the interested but somewhat victimized French and the humorous and unflappable Brit. I'm seriousit's here and it's done well enough you can easily buy into it. Merle Oberon is restrained but wonderful.Director Jacques Tourneau is always interesting and often compromised Out of the Past is interesting and very uncompromised for sure. This movie has so many shifts and complications it is hard to know what they all mean and this makes it all the more interesting even as the narration deadens our absorption into events. I admit to liking every minute of it even the bureaucratic office scenes which had their own slight believability. By the end as they all say goodbye and drive in separate directions the truth of divided Germany was cleareven in 1948.The very last scene shows a man with one leg and crutches moving through some partly destroyed columnsvery symbolic and right on.".

The BritishAmerican alliance is uneasy neither trust the Russians and all are worried about a German resurgence none can bury the past or agree on the future. It's perceptive thoughtprovoking stuff and it accurately foresees not only the Communist annexing of the fifties but also the unification of the nineties. It was made by a terrific cosmopolitan group  a gifted FrenchAmerican director a great German writer Curt Siodmak who along with his brother Robert made some of the best films of the forties and a fine international cast. The plethora of nations is amusingly summed up at the start when all the men hit on Oberon and she fobs them all off in different languages. The thriller elements of the plot don't always work so well but the characters are rich and intriguing and whilst the extensive narration is offputting it's there for a purpose. A small but profound antiwar film made at a pivotal moment in military history when politicians were only concerned with their spoils.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's 1947. Frankfort. The Nazi underground is trying to destroy the man Paul Lukas who can pull the separate parts of postwar Berlin together. That gang of thugs will stop at nothing.Kids maybe I should explain. When I used the term postwar before I meant to refer to a conflict we called World War Two or sometimes WWII. The war was just terrible. There were more deaths than in A Nightmare on Elm Street. Frankfort is in Germany not as you might think Kentucky. Germany fought on the losing side in the previously mentioned WWII. Germany including Frankfort Germany not Kentucky was in ruins that were even worse than those in the seedier parts of your own suburb. You couldn't find a J. Crew store for miles. Anyway Paul Lukas who is going to unite Germany is headed for Berlin on the train accompanied by his secretary the exoticlooking Merle Oberon. The pair meet four men who will represent the four sectors into which Berlin is divided. Robert Ryan is the American Charles Korvin is the Frenchman who turns out to be a fake Robert Coote is the proper Englishman Roman Toporow is the distant humorless dilatory Russian.Here's the plot. Lukas is kidnapped by the Nazi underground when the train stops in Frankfurt Germany who want to prevent him from unifying Berlin also Germany so that its four occupation forces will fight among themselves and let the Nazis take over again. Something like that. Oberon Ryan Korvin Coote and Toporow miss the next train to Berlin in order to throw together in an attempt to find and rescue Lukas from certain death. The detective work takes them through some louche places you wouldn't ordinarily want to go.Do the good guys manage to rescue Lukas? Are you kidding? Not only do they save him from the river they uncover Korvin's real identity when they find him trying to strangle Lukas after he has apparently been saved.This isn't a movie of any complexity. The good guys are good the bad guys are bad. They're the kind of bad guys who sacrifice one of their own in order to avoid suspicion themselves. Now that's really rotten.The only role that is at all complex  ambiguous would be a better description  is that of the Russian soldier played by Roman Toporow. He's not a stereotype exactly. He's young handsome well spoken and expressionless rather than old bald snarling and sneering.The writers had to be careful with Toporow's character because 1947 was rather a tricky years on the international stage. The West was transitioning between enemies from the hated and nowsubjugated Germans to the emerging adversaries in the Soviet Union. But the mutual hatred hadn't yet been set in cement. In 1947 nobody could foresee the Berlin Wall or the Cuban Missile Crisis or anything of that magnitude so Toporow is the least featured of the pursuers. We don't get to know much about him except that he never smiles. And when the pursuers burst into a room and find the dead body of a friendly figure Toporow is not in the shot so he doesn't get a chance to express sorrow like everyone else. But he does smile and wave goodbye at the end. Well he more or less had to. Two or three years earlier the Soviet Union had been our allies in the war against Germany and things could have gone either way in 1947.It's directed by Jacques Tourneur who had done some splendid work for Val Lewton's production unit at RKO but you wouldn't know it from this movie which is routine in almost its every element. If the writer had changed the underground Nazis into American gangsters and Paul Lukas into the newly arriving reform Chief of Police this could easily have been an inexpensive B feature.But don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it. The tight plot the educational location shooting the informative quality of the script and the Weltschmerzladen narration by Paul Stewart Berlin  the punishment fit the crime. lift it above average.".

Something like that. Oberon Ryan Korvin Coote and Toporow miss the next train to Berlin in order to throw together in an attempt to find and rescue Lukas from certain death. The detective work takes them through some louche places you wouldn't ordinarily want to go.Do the good guys manage to rescue Lukas? Are you kidding? Not only do they save him from the river they uncover Korvin's real identity when they find him trying to strangle Lukas after he has apparently been saved.This isn't a movie of any complexity. The good guys are good the bad guys are bad. They're the kind of bad guys who sacrifice one of their own in order to avoid suspicion themselves. Now that's really rotten.The only role that is at all complex  ambiguous would be a better description  is that of the Russian soldier played by Roman Toporow. He's not a stereotype exactly. He's young handsome well spoken and expressionless rather than old bald snarling and sneering.The writers had to be careful with Toporow's character because 1947 was rather a tricky years on the international stage. The West was transitioning between enemies from the hated and nowsubjugated Germans to the emerging adversaries in the Soviet Union. But the mutual hatred hadn't yet been set in cement. In 1947 nobody could foresee the Berlin Wall or the Cuban Missile Crisis or anything of that magnitude so Toporow is the least featured of the pursuers. We don't get to know much about him except that he never smiles. And when the pursuers burst into a room and find the dead body of a friendly figure Toporow is not in the shot so he doesn't get a chance to express sorrow like everyone else. But he does smile and wave goodbye at the end. Well he more or less had to. Two or three years earlier the Soviet Union had been our allies in the war against Germany and things could have gone either way in 1947.It's directed by Jacques Tourneur who had done some splendid work for Val Lewton's production unit at RKO but you wouldn't know it from this movie which is routine in almost its every element. If the writer had changed the underground Nazis into American gangsters and Paul Lukas into the newly arriving reform Chief of Police this could easily have been an inexpensive B feature.But don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it. The tight plot the educational location shooting the informative quality of the script and the Weltschmerzladen narration by Paul Stewart Berlin  the punishment fit the crime. lift it above average.";

	schema:reviewBody "The only real reason to watch this film is for the location work in Frankfurt and Berlin which really shows the results of the allied bombing in WW2. There's some good black and white cinematography and an interesting sequence in an old brewery but for a movie that promises suspense and intrigue on a train there's very little suspense incomprehensible intrigue and not much on trains. Maybe the concept made sense in 1948 but the plot left my wife and me scratching our heads. Dr. Bernhardt is a German diplomatprofessor who apparently has some sort of vision of a unified postwar Germany and is en route to a conference in Berlin to present it to the allies at a conference. There's another faction of Germans who oppose him for reasons unknown. Exactly why we're supposed to care one way or the other is unclear but the 2nd faction wants to prevent him from making his presentation. There's also some propaganda about postwar cooperation particularly regarding the Soviets. There's no chemistry between Robert Ryan and Merle Oberon who is unconvincing as a French woman and none of the characters are particularly interesting. If you want suspense and intrigue on a train I highly recommend The Narrow Margin the 1952 original not the remake. But Berlin Express is pretty underwhelming.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening script for Berlin Express gives one an idea of what to expect in this movie. Actual scenes in Frankfurt and Berlin were photographed by authorization of The United States Army of Occupation The British Army of Occupation The Soviet Army of Occupation. The film is based on a story by Curt Siodmak a German writer director and producer. He fled Germany after Hitler came to power. and wound up in Hollywood in 1937. Most of the action takes place aboard the The Main Seiner an American Army express train that ran from Paris to Berlin with a stop at Frankfurt. The film narrator says that the Berlin Express is a sort of traveling Grand Hotel for soldiers on leave and on orders for War Department clerks and wartime wives displaced persons diplomats. Other people also seem to be able to travel on the express judging by those in this film.Otto Franzen Paul Lukas was a German industrialist now a dealer in scrap metal. Henri Perrot Charles Korvin had been a member of the French underground and is now in commerce. James Sterling Robert Coote is a British war veteran and Allied teacher for reeducation in German schools. Lt. Maxim Koroshilov Roman Toporow is a Russian soldier on orders. Lucienne Mierbeau Merle Oberon is a multi linguist and secretary. Hans Schmidt Peter von Zerneck is a German civilian who speaks English and whose occupation is drowned out by the train whistle. Robert Lindley Robert Ryan is an American agriculturalist working to rebuild Germany's food and nutrition programs. A mystery traveler is soon understood to be Heinrich Bernhardt Fritz Kortner but we know he is a decoy. He was Otto Franzen and Paul Lukas was the real Bernhardt.These are the people who make up the main cast of the film. Others take part later in Berlin. All of the cast are superb. The cinematography is outstanding. The technical work and production qualities are excellent.This is the first Hollywood movie made in wartorn Germany after the May 1945 end of World War II in Europe. It shows the almost total destruction of the cities of Frankfurt and Berlin. So this film has considerable historical value. As bleak and terrible as the destruction appears  three years after the war the film doesn't show the human toll. One can get a sense of it from the stark landscapes and scenes devoid of all but a few people. Then the contrast with the scene of the busy openair market amidst the rubble. That's a place the narrator says where one can sell and buy anything from diapers to diamonds.Berlin Express was made as a mysterythriller but there's a great deal more to it than that. It is foremost a bleak picture of the widespread destruction of Germany. People of the 21st century may view this as a horror of war and rightfully so. Those who watched the film when it came out would have been more aware of the insanity of it. Not because of any hateful or spiteful vengeance on the part of the Allies for needless bombing. But because of the refusal of Germany to surrender with a lunatic at its helm. So this film stands not just as an example of the horrors of war but of the insanity of the war perpetrator who then refuses to surrender in the face of defeat and instead invites his own destruction. This film also has a clear propaganda theme. It's hope is that the Allies will be able to work together and help eventually to rebuild the devastated Germany. It does this with some light humor and jousting between the men on the train from different countries. And the film touches one more topic  postwar Nazism. It has an existing Nazi underground that reminds viewers that Nazism itself is not dead. Indeed the neoNazi beast was to rear its head soon in countries around the globe. Three things about the film are puzzling. The first is the shooting of a pigeon in the opening scene. Who would be shooting pigeons with so many people around the Eiffel Tower? And why didn't the shooter pick up the pigeon? I'll give a pass to the pigeon having the message for the suspense but it wasn't necessary to the plot. The second strange thing was on the train. One of the men who escorts the decoy Dr. Bernhardt asks Schmidt for a light as he leaves the train. He passes a message to him. It's the same message found on the pigeon 2145 D 9850 Sulzbach. Schmidt was the undercover bodyguard for Dr. Bernhardt as we learn later. Was that just an Allied relay to him about the message? The only way it makes sense is that Schmidt then got the American military guys to switch the decoy's compartment. Then the only person who would know where to kill Dr. Bernhardt the fake one would be someone on the train who saw the changes. We all find out later who that was.The third strange thing seems to be a hole in the plot. After the train stops at Sulzbach Lindley and others find that some compartments have been changed. His first compartment A is now occupied by Lucienne who had been in B. Lindley doubles up with Perrot in E. They find D unoccupied  where the decoy Bernhardt had been and the Army captain said it was to stay that way. So Bernhardt must now be in B. But as the train resumes travel and the decoy Bernhardt comes down the corridor he enters the now vacated compartment D and closes the door. The explosion goes off and kills him. Why didn't he go into his new compartment B? It seems like a plot hole and scripting or directing error.".

Most of the action takes place aboard the The Main Seiner an American Army express train that ran from Paris to Berlin with a stop at Frankfurt. The film narrator says that the Berlin Express is a sort of traveling Grand Hotel for soldiers on leave and on orders for War Department clerks and wartime wives displaced persons diplomats. Other people also seem to be able to travel on the express judging by those in this film.Otto Franzen Paul Lukas was a German industrialist now a dealer in scrap metal. Henri Perrot Charles Korvin had been a member of the French underground and is now in commerce. James Sterling Robert Coote is a British war veteran and Allied teacher for reeducation in German schools. Lt. Maxim Koroshilov Roman Toporow is a Russian soldier on orders. Lucienne Mierbeau Merle Oberon is a multi linguist and secretary. Hans Schmidt Peter von Zerneck is a German civilian who speaks English and whose occupation is drowned out by the train whistle. Robert Lindley Robert Ryan is an American agriculturalist working to rebuild Germany's food and nutrition programs. A mystery traveler is soon understood to be Heinrich Bernhardt Fritz Kortner but we know he is a decoy. He was Otto Franzen and Paul Lukas was the real Bernhardt.These are the people who make up the main cast of the film. Others take part later in Berlin. All of the cast are superb. The cinematography is outstanding. The technical work and production qualities are excellent.This is the first Hollywood movie made in wartorn Germany after the May 1945 end of World War II in Europe. It shows the almost total destruction of the cities of Frankfurt and Berlin. So this film has considerable historical value. As bleak and terrible as the destruction appears  three years after the war the film doesn't show the human toll. One can get a sense of it from the stark landscapes and scenes devoid of all but a few people. Then the contrast with the scene of the busy openair market amidst the rubble. That's a place the narrator says where one can sell and buy anything from diapers to diamonds.Berlin Express was made as a mysterythriller but there's a great deal more to it than that. It is foremost a bleak picture of the widespread destruction of Germany. People of the 21st century may view this as a horror of war and rightfully so. Those who watched the film when it came out would have been more aware of the insanity of it. Not because of any hateful or spiteful vengeance on the part of the Allies for needless bombing. But because of the refusal of Germany to surrender with a lunatic at its helm. So this film stands not just as an example of the horrors of war but of the insanity of the war perpetrator who then refuses to surrender in the face of defeat and instead invites his own destruction. This film also has a clear propaganda theme. It's hope is that the Allies will be able to work together and help eventually to rebuild the devastated Germany. It does this with some light humor and jousting between the men on the train from different countries. And the film touches one more topic  postwar Nazism. It has an existing Nazi underground that reminds viewers that Nazism itself is not dead. Indeed the neoNazi beast was to rear its head soon in countries around the globe. Three things about the film are puzzling. The first is the shooting of a pigeon in the opening scene. Who would be shooting pigeons with so many people around the Eiffel Tower? And why didn't the shooter pick up the pigeon? I'll give a pass to the pigeon having the message for the suspense but it wasn't necessary to the plot. The second strange thing was on the train. One of the men who escorts the decoy Dr. Bernhardt asks Schmidt for a light as he leaves the train. He passes a message to him. It's the same message found on the pigeon 2145 D 9850 Sulzbach. Schmidt was the undercover bodyguard for Dr. Bernhardt as we learn later. Was that just an Allied relay to him about the message? The only way it makes sense is that Schmidt then got the American military guys to switch the decoy's compartment. Then the only person who would know where to kill Dr. Bernhardt the fake one would be someone on the train who saw the changes. We all find out later who that was.The third strange thing seems to be a hole in the plot. After the train stops at Sulzbach Lindley and others find that some compartments have been changed. His first compartment A is now occupied by Lucienne who had been in B. Lindley doubles up with Perrot in E. They find D unoccupied  where the decoy Bernhardt had been and the Army captain said it was to stay that way. So Bernhardt must now be in B. But as the train resumes travel and the decoy Bernhardt comes down the corridor he enters the now vacated compartment D and closes the door. The explosion goes off and kills him. Why didn't he go into his new compartment B? It seems like a plot hole and scripting or directing error.";

	schema:reviewBody "Poll is a coproduction between Germany Austria and Estonia from 2010 so it has its 7th anniversary this year. Fittingly there are also all kinds of languages spoken in here so you will most likely needs subtitles at least for some parts. The writer and director is Chris Kraus and it was his most recent work before the new movie Die Blumen von Gestern. And just like that one this one here also has a historic component actually a really big one. The movie is set around the time when World War I started and the film's main character is played by the really young Paula Beer who recently had a bit of an international breakthrough as well in the movie Frantz. Anyway back to this one we have here. I am not too surprised that there has not been another review on IMDb so far as it was not too great of a watch and I found the 7.0 rating by 846 voters as of 29012017 really too high. German film biffs will find more familiar cast members perhaps like Selge Mller Trebs Steinhauer or Ritter even if none of them are very big names. The movie was pretty successful at several awards bodies like the German Film Awards back then where Richy Mller received the biggest honor of his career and the film also scored in several categories. These however were all wins that could justify this film being called a piece of style over substance and I think it is true. I did not find it a rewarding watch at any point but thanks to the weak script it dragged on several occasions. The period of World War I has always been one that interests me less than World War II but still the problem is not the bleakness the problem is the overall uninteresting depiction of and elaboration on characters and scenarios that does not do justice at all to the tumultuous times over a century ago. Beer's talent is sometimes visible and there are moments when she elevates the material and script but it is far from enough especially taking into account that this one runs for over 2 hours actually. I cannot share the praise that some people have for it and I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

Looking at Ruttman's earlier work in Opus IIV his interest for turning abstract material into delightful optical compositions are more obvious.

I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Elvis or who dislikes Elvis because this movie will most possibly change your mind!  The movie also has a lot of values everyone needs to know in life.

Keitel is wonderful at playing tough guys but I think he really shines as an actor in his smaller and more lowkey movies like this one and Smoke. The cast is excellent  some playing celebrity impersonators who are real complex human beings with personalities of their own. Bridget Fonda as a tender almost motherly Marilyn Monroe is great fun to watch. I've seen this movie several times and it holds up well always revealing new layers of story and message. Wonderful scenery a classy car excellent performances and a quirky plot make this a worthwhile movie to watch. Maybe even to watch over and over. I hope you like it as much as I do.".

From out west to gambling in Tunica Mississippi to crying on Elvis's carpet inside Graceland. Priscilla was an advisor to the film and allowed some intimate participation from the estate. Harvey Keitel is a HOOT! Thumbs up and thank you ver.. ...alright I won't.";

The initial interactions between Byron and Elvis seemed one dimensional and uninteresting and absolutely nothing made Byron Gruman endearing as a character Until well past the first hour.  Keitel was of course good in his role but Schaech was stiff and the direction was actually quite bad in places.  Bridget Fonda plays a somewhat endearing Marilyn Monroe impersonator only annoying while her character is in character.  Truth be told I was tempted to turn the movie off halfway through it and go on to one of the other titles I had rented for the weekend. I am glad I did not.  The movie is entertaining for the last 45 minutes and toward the end Schaech finally reaches down deep to pull off a rather heartwarming performance.  This is a multifaceted story of redemption with every character eventually finding something they had needed all along. Finding Graceland is most definitely worth the price of a video rental so long as you can stand a long and often boring buildup.  In the end the story aptly uses the growing mythology of The King to tell a story that is worth the time it takes to hear it.".

I caught it during the opening credits and I had no clue what to expect.  I wasn't too concerned though.  Any film involving Keitel usually has its rewards.  The story follows a young man who was widowed a year ago.  He's taking a road trip when he picks up a drifter who claims to be Elvis but looks nothing like the king.  This is the kind of feelgood drama that I haven't seen in a long time. Perhaps what suprised me the most was that this is the kind of flick that the whole family can enjoy.  The prfanity is very light and there is one mild scene of sexuality.  Harvey Keitel delivers a knockout performance as Elvis and Bridget Fonda was also quite good in a barely recognizable role as a Marilyn Monroe impersonator.  It was only when she took off the makeup that I recognized her.  This one is well worth seeing.".

I think it was Roustabout and I wasn't too impressed. I liked his singing but I really was more of the DylanBeatles generation.I was expecting the film to be like Elvis has Left the Building just a comedy making fun of Elvis impersonators. It is not like that at all. It was a bittersweet romantic road tale. See Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins Easy Rider The Last Detail or TrainsPlains and Automobiles for other examples. Basically the formula is incompatibles find themselves traveling together to a common destination and having adventures along the way that bring them together.Harvey Keitel is not a great Elvis impersonator and Bridget Fonda is not a great Marilyn Monroe impersonator. This is a weakness in the film but on the other hand they do build sincere believable and likable characters. Keitel and Fonda are wonderful actors and this film does give them some room to work and show off their craft.The film is pleasant to watch and has a few nice comedy moments. Most of these have to do with Keitel trying to cheer up melancholy Johnathon Schaech. However I think the film gets more soulful and touching towards the end when the characters do make it to Memphis. The scenes inside and outside of Graceland are fascinating.The film basically says that Elvis Presley was a wonderful singer and a nice guy and we miss him like we miss all dead people in our lives that we loved. It is sweet and respectful of Elvis. You get the feeling that it is exactly the type of film he would have made if he had knowingly chosen to make a last film.The writerdirector David Winkler hasn't done anything this nice and personal since.

Geographically the main focus is on Potsdamer Platz the surroundings of the now finished Lehrter Stadtbahnhof the government quarter and the surroundings of the Alexanderplatz former East Berlin where during the shooting of this film  besides endless political debate  nothing significant happened but where the main focus of the building activities has shifted during the last couple of years. No other city in he world has seen an urban renewal project on such a scale as Berlin in the '90s and it's still far from finished if it ever will be. The film contains some stunning aerial footage perhaps the only way to fully grasp the scale of the mammoth rebuilding in the city greatly enhanced by the soundtrack from the Berlin group Einstrzende Neubauten. Off course it's not just the scale of these projects that are important but also the political debates concerning the various projects touching not only Berlin but German history and identity as well. As a whole the film is a little uneven as it wavers between architectural documentary spiritual journey and an overview of Berlin and German history. Nevertheless essential viewing for anyone with an interest in architecture urban planning and history in general.Camera Obscura  710".

The writer and director is Hubertus Siegert and it is still among his most known works today maybe even number 1 in the list. It is about Berlin but I as a Berlin citizen do not think that it is enough if you have an interest in this wonderful place but you also need to have interest in the history city planning and maybe even architecture to enjoy this one. If you do then you may have a truly great time seeing this one. But I don't think there are too many people who have an interest in all this.However this should not mean that it was a bad or even horrible watch. The topic makes it just pretty difficult to make a connection with this 1.5hour film even if the people seem likable in here and listening to them does not only provide a great deal of information but also may put a smile on your lips sometimes because they are just unintentionally funny with their quirks and comments. And it becomes obvious that they know a whole lot about the subject of this film. But I myself wonder if I really want to know a lot or learn a lot. Perhaps not but that's just my bias with the topic that cannot entertain me really. By general standards this film is a success I guess just for a very limited target audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Drum is the story of Henry Nxumalo a journalist for South Africa's pioneering Drum magazine. Set in the mid1950s the film attempts to recreate the ambiance of Sophiatown an area of shops and nightclubs in central Johannesburg that has been compared to Harlem during its Renaissance. Henry is at first content to write sports stories for the magazine until the gradual encroachment of apartheid laws threatens his beloved neighbourhood. Henry's politicization leads to confrontations with the authorities and to a predictable end.Overall I don't feel like I have much to complain about. It's just that well I think I expected more punch. I'm a veteran of many films and plays dealing with South African history but most of them Cry Freedom and the underappreciated Barbara Hershey vehicle A World Apart for instance deal with the political awakening of white liberal South Africans and have been directed by white often foreign directors. Even so I found them powerful and inspiring. Naturally I expected that a film about a genuine black hero directed by a young black South African director would be even more powerful and affecting. And this one just wasn't. Clearly the casting of American Taye Diggs in the role of Henry has a little bit to do with it. His casting tells me that the director wanted to make a commercial film and with that comes some inevitable trade offs. The film feels too short and hurried to make Henry's transformation convincing. His relationships with his wife boss and colleagues were surely an integral part of the story and yet they feel superficial here. At the QA after the film Diggs even admits that he still feels the part should have gone to a South African actor. The director countered that women dig Taye Diggs and that his presence would put bums in seats. Enough said about that.The music though stands out and almost succeeds in elevating the film. Granted it is pretty hard to mess up the music in a South African film and here there is a fine mix of township jazz and mournful hymns that hints at what life in Sophiatown must have been like.In summary the film was competently written directed shot and acted. But it feels a little bit like a missed opportunity. Apart from the two films I mentioned above you really should see the onewoman play The Syringa Tree by Pamela Gien if you ever get the chance. That play performed by one woman on a nearly bare stage has left indelible images in my mind that no film can ever match.710".

I am thinking of films like Das Experiment and Die Welle which directly or indirectly investigate what lies behind a dictatorship like Nazism and the dangers of falling into one again which sometimes may seem far away. With this film this time we are taken very close to the reality of a small supposedly East German town where farright extremists rule the place and intimidate migrants. The point of view is entirely coincident with the main character Marisa awardwinner Ukrainianborn Alina Levshin who plays the passionate girlfriend of one of the gang's most violent and dangerous subjects. Her acting is amazing and as already stated by another reviewer it brings the film to a totally different level giving it the effectiveness of a documentary. The film is essentially about a girl who seems to know very well what she wants to the extent that her whole body is covered in tattoos which are also political statements while in fact some events will force her to reconsider not only her set of values but also a relationship with a man whose deep love quickly turns into the deepest hate. On the background there is a side story about Marisa's dying Nazi grandfather. She doesn't want to accept that he had been violent to her own wife before she was born and that relates directly to the violence she in turn has chosen to surround herself with. A 15 years old seeking to be accepted into the gang is also dragged into this spiral of hate and violence  a consequence of her dominating father  until she understand what that really means. The third girl of the gang is always in the background she's very passive and hardly talks and shows a melancholy which turns out to be a result of life's injustice. This is in my opinion the best German film since Gegen die WandHead On. Both educational and a piece of literally screaming art. A must see!".

	schema:reviewBody "This unlikely movie is a concentrate of all the stereotypes the controlled medias daily feed to their public. Here are some of the most preposterous suggestions it attempts to hammer into the viewer's mind  The German farright scene is entirely composed of wild loud unreasoning skinheads only suited at getting drunk and exercise mindless violence. Just on the contrary most neonazi militants are perfectly articulate persons with job and family apt to argument their political views.Only people with an unbalanced familiar background and childhood problems enter the right scene. This idea is so dull that I won't even expend words to counteract it.By contrast refugees are pleasant quiet balanced persons who only come to Europe to be reunited with their family. I once lived two months close to a camp full of this... humanity and I heartily recommend such an experience to anybody approaching this outrageous movie. As a side remainder and according to official if wellhidden statistics 90  of drug dealing in Germany is managed by immigrants.The conclusion is one of the movie's most weird moments. I won't spoil it for you but it serves the director's intent in impressing one more cracked stereotype people in the right scene live and die by futile pointless violence.In the final grotesquerie the dying protagonist devotes her final words to explain how wonderful democracy is. Not only the idea is so trite but hey  everybody expects people suddenly shot in the abdomen to sputter a lecture of regime's political humbug.The movie is technically welldone and enriched by the two female protagonists' excellent acting. Regimes lavish their best efforts on means of propaganda like this one.

	onyx:emotionText "This unlikely movie is a concentrate of all the stereotypes the controlled medias daily feed to their public. Here are some of the most preposterous suggestions it attempts to hammer into the viewer's mind  The German farright scene is entirely composed of wild loud unreasoning skinheads only suited at getting drunk and exercise mindless violence. Just on the contrary most neonazi militants are perfectly articulate persons with job and family apt to argument their political views.Only people with an unbalanced familiar background and childhood problems enter the right scene. This idea is so dull that I won't even expend words to counteract it.By contrast refugees are pleasant quiet balanced persons who only come to Europe to be reunited with their family. I once lived two months close to a camp full of this... humanity and I heartily recommend such an experience to anybody approaching this outrageous movie. As a side remainder and according to official if wellhidden statistics 90  of drug dealing in Germany is managed by immigrants.The conclusion is one of the movie's most weird moments. I won't spoil it for you but it serves the director's intent in impressing one more cracked stereotype people in the right scene live and die by futile pointless violence.In the final grotesquerie the dying protagonist devotes her final words to explain how wonderful democracy is. Not only the idea is so trite but hey  everybody expects people suddenly shot in the abdomen to sputter a lecture of regime's political humbug.The movie is technically welldone and enriched by the two female protagonists' excellent acting. Regimes lavish their best efforts on means of propaganda like this one. And that's what the film is a blatant straightforward piece of political indoctrination aimed at slandering the Establishment's political opponents. This movie is pretty everything Western freethought cant reviles... as long as it is performed by its opponents.";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie a few years ago in a screening provided by our school for educational purposes. The topic itself isn't often depicted in German movies. That's why I was excited to see Kriegerin. It even won the German Film Award for Best Feature Film so it had to be good  but it wasn't.While it is indeed interesting to see the rare portrayal of a female neoNazi and a girl who is getting involved with the rightwing extremist skinheads Kriegerin fails at other aspects. As a German citizen and someone familiar with the rightwing extremist culture I think it's only showing a clichd picture composed of neoNazis with combat boots lots of tattoos which say 14 words or 88 and who are dumb and only seeking violence. It seems as though they are a rather barbaric people. Rightwing extremist skinheads who behave most of the time as shown in the movie are not the majority anymore among the neoNazis in fact they're number is decreasing. NeoNazism still lives mainly because of two factors 1. Autonome Nationalisten AN who make up the largest group of Nazis 2. Political parties such as NPD Republikaner and other influences in politics.Kriegerin fails raising awareness of how someone gets sucked into the neoNazi scene and what the common Nazi is like today. It doesn't really matter whether the acting  especially of Alina Levshin was good or if the approach of going with female main characters is brave and interesting  the main purpose should be educating the viewer about current racism and antiSemitism in Germany. Unfortunately the filmmakers didn't deliver at all. Search the web for Autonome Nationalisten and you get a vastly different picture about today's Nazis and their recruiting and propaganda strategies.".

	schema:headline " Excellent breakthrough performance keeps this film from being a failure";
	schema:reviewBody "Kriegerin German term for a female warrior is a 4yearold 105minute movie written and directed by David Wnendt. The best way to see this is not as a film which will tell you accurately about life as a Nazi or life in a Nazi community but as a character study of two females and what factors caused them to end up in this company of rightwing extremists. It has a lot to do with the behavior from their parents including emotional and physical the cigarette scene abuse by those who are supposed to protect them and help them finding their place in life. The way these two girls developed during the movie makes it obvious that they do not necessarily believe in the ideal of Nazis but their acting in accordance with them is really more a consequence of wanting to belong somewhere and being accepted the way they are. However quite ironically they are changing in order to be accepted and they willingly do so. I am not really sure if I found Levshin's or Haase's character more interesting. However it is obvious that Levshin's character sees parallels to herself in Haase's character. And as she becomes more tolerant also thanks to the boy she tries to be a helping hand to Haase's character and maybe prevent her from making the same mistakes she did.This was the big breakthrough film for Ukrainianborn Alina Levshin. She won a German Film Award for it and is since considered among the top actresses of her generation on the German market. And it was also one of Haase's breakthrough films. David Wnendt won a German Film Award as well for his screenplay and the film itself was honored as the third best movie of the year. Wnendt went on to direct the heavilydiscussed Feuchtgebiete based on Charlotte Roche's novel after that an in my opinion terrible film that couldn't be more different from Kriegerin. Still somehow I expected more from Kriergerin. I really do not believe the screenplay is that good. It's almost entirely Levshin's performance which holds this film so well together. At times especially at the very final scene near the sea this film could have done with tome more subtlety in my opinion. But Wnendt went for overthetop showiness instead sadly. Also I would have preferred an approach which not only displays the women in the Nazi community as victims or as somewhat good people. Maybe one of the guys helping the girls would have been nice as well. It's almost sexist. With some slight alterations this could have been an actually great film and not only a decent one. Still all in all I recommend watching it.".

I was expecting to watch a documentary that fell into that nearly unavoidable pit of shameless selfpromotionidolization.I was WRONG! This nearly 120minute EPIC not only is probably the most humble and honest boxingdoc I've ever seen. It redefines the format of the standard sportsdocumentary and presents us with an insight into the REAL important moments of a fighter's career namely dealing with loss mental and physical defeat maintaining you strife for excellence and learning from your mistakes.The documentary is engrossing it spans the early childhood of the brothers their excellence in local Ukrainian kickboxing their switch to a pro career... all information is presented with exceptional moderation providing nothing but essential and informative stories and facts. No 'deadair' here folks! The picture that this film paints is one of overcoming personal and psychological issues becoming a better person through hardship and defeat through challenge and distress.The documentary also sheds an interesting light on Vitali's political engagements which i found to be quite remarkable. I could also appreciate that the film doesn't focus on the brother's charity work in detail. Something that I found refreshingly selfless and humble.IN CONCLUSION The film is long but every single minute is entertaining informative and just a great watch. The editing and production are tremendous.The film left me with a remarkable feeling even though i know I just watched the defining documentary about two of the most successful boxers in history I came to the realization that what was portrayed in the film was much more humble and sincere. The film focused on the VERY few losses they had and doesn't ravel in the greatness that they rightfully have established. Very few 'EPIC' scenes and plenty of personal heartfelt and sincere moments with the Klitchko's.I rate this film a 910  Not just based on content but also as a film that could possibly provide a blueprint for the 'new style' of sports documentaries. all in all A MUST SEE!!!".

Vladimir has another fight up soon and Vitali seems retired by now and active in politics exclusively. What did not make sense to me though is that they say at one point that Wladimir is the more diplomatic of the two. But why is Vitali then in politics now? Anyway we also hear some information on the brothers from their longtime coach Fritz Sdunek who died not too long ago. Also boxer Chris Byrd gets to tell us his take on the Klitschko brothers for quite a big part of the film. One part I found interesting and funny is when they told how the other Klitschko not the one they initially wanted came to Germany for the first time and he looked exactly the same. I agree. I never know who is who either. The brother mentality is good too that they would never fight each other in the ring and I liked the RHCP music. However some of the other music was too dramatic for my taste and it got a bit cringeworthy at times.If you have not been a boxing enthusiast before watching this it will probably not wow you either. i personally found Dewhnhardt's Nowitzki documentary more interesting and captivating. In addition you have to say that this is still a really brutal sport and there are some fight scenes in this movie which are certainly not for everybody.".

The voiceover bookends worked so well and I kept thinking about all stories are love stories for the rest of the day.

I was particularly impressed by Claudius Franz as Mitsch and of course the beautiful Jana Pallaske as Margarete. This girl rocks! I loved the cool score and went to your MySpace page for more.

	schema:reviewBody "BERLIN AM MEER is a highly enjoyable romancedrama with a lot of smart comedy parts in it. The cast is a very well functioning ensemble of fresh faces and young talents. Best known internationally is Robert Stadlober as Tom who started his big screen career with Sonnenallee which was quite a success in Germany. Up and coming is Jana Pallaske as Margarete  who will be seen in lead next to German super star Til Schweiger in Phantomschmerz and in two other Warner projects within the year. The newcomer is Claudius Franz as Mitsch. Fresh out of film school he gives proof of his extraordinary talent in his first feature appearance. The film is about a group of twenty s.th. guys who's easy student life is turned up side down when the younger sister  Mavie Anna Brggemann of their roommate Mitsch Claudius Franz is moving in. The film is music driven. With a blast soundtrack mix from those ultra hip local music groups like Jeans Team 2Raumwohnung Hund am Strand and famous Mia and Wir sind Helden. The film authentically shows the current life of this age group in a major European city. Living an easy life without obligations financed by some waiter jobs. Partying 'till they drop in the coolest clubs in town. Finally it is quite a heart wrenching romance. Listen to the voice over in the beginning and towards the ending. My favorite scene the slowly cumulating party scene in Margaretes Jana Pallaske apt. Never seen a hilarious and authentic party like this in a movie.".

In this aspect this film is like a documentary of this urban student situation. Very authentic the interaction of the characters. Definitely is Robert Stadlober the most obvious talent of the ensemble but he is by no means overruling the scene. In particular strong of talent the newcomer Claudius Franz. The soundtrack is a blast. The picture has an extraordinary true feature film look. Hard to believe that it has been a HD shot. the lensjob is the best coming from Germany in a long time. R. Wolf".

	schema:reviewBody "Since its premiere Berlin in Berlin has sent sound waves throughout the transnational cinema culture. One can still see the repercussions it has on the German and Turkish film industry today. The film director Sinan etin was the first person to create a film that switched the roles of having an ethnic Turk feeling out of place within Germany and an ethnic German fitting in with society. This role reversal can also be seen as the first film and the beginning of the second phase of Turkish German Cinema the pleasures of hybridity phase. This film follows a young ethnic male German who falls in love with a Turkish colleague's wife and by unforeseen circumstances is forced to live and hide out in her home with the rest of her ethnic Turkish family. The film makes use of the cinematic gaze right out of the gates with the first scene filled with stares between audience and character and character and character. Although there are only three different sets to the film this allows the viewer to focus more on the plot and how what is happening is affecting everyone involved. Berlin in Berlin is a suspenseful piece with very sound acting and a simple but innovative storyline. Recommended that everyone should watch this film to understand the transition of filming throughout Turkish German Cinema history.".

The film director Sinan etin was the first person to create a film that switched the roles of having an ethnic Turk feeling out of place within Germany and an ethnic German fitting in with society. This role reversal can also be seen as the first film and the beginning of the second phase of Turkish German Cinema the pleasures of hybridity phase. This film follows a young ethnic male German who falls in love with a Turkish colleague's wife and by unforeseen circumstances is forced to live and hide out in her home with the rest of her ethnic Turkish family. The film makes use of the cinematic gaze right out of the gates with the first scene filled with stares between audience and character and character and character. Although there are only three different sets to the film this allows the viewer to focus more on the plot and how what is happening is affecting everyone involved. Berlin in Berlin is a suspenseful piece with very sound acting and a simple but innovative storyline. Recommended that everyone should watch this film to understand the transition of filming throughout Turkish German Cinema history.";

	schema:reviewBody "Taking a hostage is usually seen as an act of terror and is one of the worst things that could happen to most people. However at least one instance exists where being a hostage is a blessing rather than a curse. Berlin in Berlin directed by Sinan Cetin sets up a dynamic where a man is thankful to be a prisoner because his other option is death. When a German construction worker named Thomas Armin Block sees a beautiful Turkish woman named Dilber Hulya Avsar he starts taking pictures of her without her knowledge. The woman's husband finds out and confronts her which leads to a fight between the husband and Thomas. The husband dies in the fight and Thomas runs away from the wife's brothers lead by Muertuez Cem Ozer and accidentally runs into the family's home. Muertez wants to kill Thomas but the parents insist on letting him life as long as he stays under their supervision. Cetin creates moments of stress using prolonged shots intense music and shaking cameras. A key turning point in the film is when a man breaks into the home because Muertez is sleeping with his girlfriend. The man attacks Muertez with a knife and Thoman saves him. This scene is a major turning point in the relationship between Thomas and the family from mistrust and hatred to equality and acceptance. Overall this film captivated the audience and was exciting from start to finish. It was rare to be bored with what was going on in the film. I recommend this film to people who enjoy plots based on drama and action.".

The entire beginning of Berlin in Berlin shows a man having an irresistible attraction to a married woman and begins to follow her around his work place. Sinan Cetin the film's producer and director does a great job in the beginning showing the man's attraction to the woman when he begins to take pictures of the woman secretly. Each camera shot is filmed in a certain angle that expresses a sort of distance the man is having yet still close enough to keep his eye on her. The issue arises when the man prints the pictures and has them lying around in the work place. Years later the man played by Cem Ozer still has an obsessive attraction to that woman and wishes to find her in hopes of getting her forgiveness. Through many unfortunate wrong turns he ends up taking cover in a stranger's home only to find out that he is staying in the home of the man that he killed years ago. The film brings out many cultural aspects throughout the movie. The man is eventually spotted within the household by everyone is about to be killed however everyone is stopped by the grandmother and father. Traditions are a big part of their life and since the man was considered a guest in the house he was given the ability to live due to their customs. The man continues to figure a way out without getting shot but knows once he is out the door so are the traditions that is keeping him safe. This creates a great plot for the story because of the development of relationships that you see within the household and the actions that the man take sin order to escape. This movie revolves around Turkish culture and how its influence can keep people from acting a certain way. The ending had a twist because even once the man is out the front door caught by the dead man's brother and is stood up on gun point just . Although the movie only had a few scenes its production of scenes demonstrating the Turkish culture made the movie become easier to understand and therefore made it more interesting it is a must see.".

It was first released in 1993 and in same year it was entered into the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. The actress in this film Hulya Avsar won the Best Actress award at the festival. The summary of this film is that a young German man stalks a Turkish married woman and he accidentally kills her husband while trying to stop their fight. Later he bumps into victim husband's brothers and ran into a random house to hide. However that place was a house of the husband's family including the married women he stalked. Although 'Berlin in Berlin' is not widely known or a blockbuster film considering that this movie was filmed in 1993 I thought it has impressive story plot and setting. There are not many fancy sequences but it reveals a certain culture specifically the Turkish by an ironic setting of the film. It is better to watch this film knowing that Turkey has a tradition of welcoming guest whoever that person is even the enemies. In this film although the young German man was a murder of their brother or son the family starts to communicate with him and somehow respect him as time goes by. It was interesting to see how the two cultures meet and how the characters start to know and understand each other.".

	schema:reviewBody "Berlin  Ecke Schnhauser is an East German movie from 1957 so this one will have its 60th anniversary next year. The director is Gerhard Klein and he also wrote the script together with Wolfgang Kohlhaase probably a much more familiar name due to his long contributions to the German film industry. Here we have a movie that is fairly short does not even make it to 80 minutes and tells the story of a group of teenagers. Unfortunately I found none of them really interesting and the characters basically all seemed interchangeable. The acting was very mediocre and I am not surprised I don't know any of the actors from anything other than the equally mediocre Edgar Wallace films. The script has a decent moment here and there in terms of dramatic storytelling but not enough either. It is pretty telling that this film is today probably considered one of the more known and famous movies from the GDR and it is still nothing special. Great moviemaking may certainly not have been the country's strength. I also don't believe that it has to do with that film being blackandwhite still despite color easily being on the forefront already around that time. It is a just an accumulation of too many subpar factors that play together here. I give this one a thumbs down. Not recommended.".

	schema:headline " Leslie's screen farewell  a haunting ghostly one.";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1935 Leslie Howard made one of his finest films in the historic romance THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. He played the hero Sir Percy Blakeney who was a society leader but also a society twit who spent time staring through an eyeglass criticizing the way a man's cravat was tied or a sleeve was cut or how Romney was painting his wife. But when alone with his intimates he was The Scarlet Pimpernel who planned the rescue of French aristocrats from the guillotine. He and his gang are fighting a war to the death against Citizen Chauvin Raymond Massey the Jacobin agentminister to Britain who is seeking to end the rescues. In between is his beloved but seemingly tarnished wife Merle Oberon who is trying to save her captured brother and unknowingly reveals her husband's secret to Chauvin. The conclusion of this adventure film was very exciting and surprising. But there was and is a problem with THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. Despite Baroness Orczy's marvelous writing ability try her detective tales of THE OLD MAN IN THE CORNER as a good followup she was deeply impressed with the old order of aristocracy. Only once in the film did a sense of balance come through  and oddly enough out of the mouth of the villain. Merle Oberon had testified for the French Revolutionary Court against some aristocrats dooming them by her testimony to death. She has never forgiven herself and it has blackened her reputation. In bemoaning this Massey gets disgusted and spits out Why is it that everyone is always condemning what happened to the poor aristocrats and never think of what they did to us?! It's a good point but because we dislike Massey and his boss Robespierre of course we never stop to consider it for long. Howard was able to repeat and improve on the original film in 1942 with PIMPERNEL SMITH where as Professor Horatio Smith he uses his archaeological digs in Germany for proof of an Aryan civilization before Greece or Rome to rescue intellectuals and victims of the Nazi Reich. Here his opponent is General Von Graum Francis L. Sullivan who is like Chauvin in his sharpness and pomposity. He is an obvious knock at Hermann Goering who was obese like Sullivan and has Goering's sham bonhomie and his total vicious streak. The writer of the screenplay must have had some discussion with German refugees in the know notice the bits about Von Graum throwing a tantrum and then turning about and offering German chocolate to someone who has come through for him. The film also uses Howard to brilliant advantage in one sequence disguised as a bureaucrat who he himself states was the most disagreeable person he ever thought up. The ultimately efficient German bureaucrat is totally inhuman  a talking machine of bossy efficiency. Percy Blakeney was disguised several times as an old crone and a soldier but never someone so disagreeable.And that is the difference. THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL deals with the 1790s and the Reign of Terror. It was a century and a half in the past and really could not annoy the French too much though one wonders what it's box office was like in France. Britain and Germany were at war in 1942 and the film couldn't present even one moment where Von Graum could make a comment like Chauvin's outburst. As a matter of historic record Chauvin had some point about the sins of the Ancien Regime as opposed to the Revolutionaries. Knowing what we know now about Von Graum's buddies he would not have been able to say much.The closing of the movie was a memorable speech by Howard about how Germany's entrance into war was not the start of it's road to glory but to it's destruction. True enough in 1945  1950 or so. And when he manages to take advantage of Von Graum's brief distraction to vanish into the night the Nazi fires his gun into the empty space. I'll be back we hear Howard repeat twice. It is haunting because of his real fate of being shot down in the war by a Nazi plane. Howard physically did not return but spiritually he did with the men at DDay all the way to V.E.Day.".

	schema:reviewBody "Returning to England before the war Leslie Howard was a towering figure in the British government's antiNazi propaganda policy making patriotic radio broadcasts and movies that lifted the spirits of the British people in the dark days of the war. One such film was Pimpernel Smith in which Howard plays Archeology Professor Horatio Smith who doubles as a British spy undertaking to help refugees escape from the Gestapo. Based on the novel The Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Emmuska Orczy and modeled after the 1934 film of the same name Pimpernel Smith is said to have influenced Raoul Wallenberg known for his heroism in rescuing Hungarian Jews from the Holocaust. In the film Professor Smith takes six students with him on an archaeological dig in Germany presumably to find out whether or not there was an early Aryan civilization in Germany. Smith tries to convince Gestapo leader General Von Graum Francis L. Sullivan that he is just a learned professor reading from The Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll and telling him his theory that William Shakespeare was really the Earl of Oxford. Imagine that! The Professor's wit and wisdom are no match for the humorless Nazis and they seem to fall for each of the professor's tricks. Unfortunately the Nazis are depicted not as mass murderers but only as bumbling clowns who speak English as well as Winston Churchill. When Smith is wounded the students catch on to what he is up to and agree to help him in his attempts to secure the release of pianist Sidimir Koslowski Peter Gawthorne. In his clandestine cat and mouse game he meets Koslowski's daughter Ludmilla Mary Morris who is working for the Nazis in order to save her father and the two form a bond. Howard's role as Professor Smith is one of his most acclaimed in a career that included roles as Ashley Wilkes in Gone With the Wind and Sir Percy Blakeney in The Scarlet Pimpernel. He had a great sense of style and screen presence and his death in 1943 on what was most likely an intelligence gathering mission for the British left the film industry bereft of one of its brightest stars.".

In the iconic original he manages to effectively portray the mildmannered fop more interested in clothing than fighting the warrior and man of action known as the Pimpernel and even the romantic counterpart to his wife who in a brilliant subplot was also not what she seemed but for entirely different reasons. It was an astonishing portrayal. Hollywood being what it is was? Howard was given a second chance to play the same character in a modern setting as an underground agent working against the Nazis on their own soil. The script direction and acting are all superb. The only negative is that this film TAKEN ON ITS OWN might seem contrived and overwritten. Unless  THIS IS THE KEY  you see the original first. Remember that this was the era before 500 cable channels and streaming video. It is a 'given' that the audience for this film was familiar with the first. So if you you follow their footsteps and see the films in proper order the sheer bravado and outrage within this script will pop and you will enjoy a tremendously entertaining film by a master at the top of his craft.In particular the exchanges between Howard and his nemesis played by Francis L.

	schema:headline " Unmissable starring role for Leslie Howard";
	schema:reviewBody "On the face of it I don't ask much of a film only  only!  that it should make me laugh and cry and catch my breath and stir my blood in equal measure. Strange then how rare this seems to be... and how few films earn the final accolade by almost forcing me to review them! I had not the slightest intention this morning of writing about Pimpernel Smith. But now that I sit down afterwards and try to work I find my attention wandering back to it again and again. Clearly I must set down this review or I shall never get anything done... and there can be few stronger tributes to the power of a film.Leslie Howard of course makes or breaks the whole. As producer director and starring actor his name is scrawled  literally  on the film from its opening titles indeed it gives us a chance to recognise the penmanship on the mysterious handwritten notes that recur! Unsurprisingly in some ways this is very much a oneman vehicle. If Leslie Howard's charms escape you the whole production is probably a dead loss  but for any fan of his earlier films it is little short of unalloyed delight.Pimpernel Smith takes much of its resonance from the subtle parallels with Baroness Orczy's story of the Scarlet Pimpernel. The latter is openly referred to only in the title but acknowledged in a dozen ways from the leading character who cloaks an incisive mind beneath a foolish mask to the young acolytes who aid and yet rashly put him at risk the woman who is set to spy out the identity of a beloved one's potential saviour and of course the closed frontiers and despotic arm of a newfledged state  not Revolutionary France but a Nazi Germany not yet at open war.   Above all the echoes lie in the ingenious guises and plans for escape always one twist ahead of both the enemy and the viewers themselves. By the end of the film I was suspecting the most innocent characters of being the nondescript Professor Smith in disguise... and I'm still not certain about the indignant lady on the Cook's Tour!The references however are never obtrusive and always remain subtle and of course perhaps the chief of these is the casting of Leslie Howard himself. Along with a humane and intelligent script it was his outstanding depiction of the title role that raised the 1934 film of The Scarlet Pimpernel above the average. Even today the association is immediate. Less than ten years after the original the dual performance of their star must have been inescapable.From vacuous fop to absentminded professor... and yet it is to Howard's credit that his Professor Smith is not a carbon copy of Sir Percy Blakeney but a distinct and undoubtedly charming character in his own right.   For a moment rapt in admiration of an Aphrodite he is startlingly handsome. But for the most part peering owlishly over a newspaper or buried beneath a deplorable hat he is more the living spit of bespectacled Charles Hawtrey in some postwar Carry On. He has developed the baggy amble to a fine art and the knack of deprecation and inoffensive insolence almost without effort and the role of gentle academic is not a pose but the guiding principle behind all his unlikely impersonations even that of the part of hero. The Professor above all is a man who hates destruction and waste.Passionate screen kisses rarely move me oddly enough a handful of restrained moments of tenderness in this film did. It may be a carefullyscripted star vehicle but few enough of those choose to celebrate the clever and the unassuming. I like Professor Smith very much indeed.But even the quietest hero needs a villain as foil and Francis L. Sullivan is also outstanding here as the elephantine von Graum a Nazi general who turns out to be far less stupid than one might assume. It's hard not to suspect the character of being a lampoon on Goering and from the start we are invited to laugh at him but for all his girth and his struggles with the English sense of humour von Graum is brighter by far than most of his staff and sometimes even one step ahead of the viewer which makes it hard to be complacent on our heroes' behalf. He may rant and foam for lack of proof but the net is tightening... and without the advantage of Orczy's predetermined plot the unexpected twist at the end of this film could all too easily go either way. Unfortunately heroism is not necessarily defined by survival...In fact in retrospect I feel that the ending which I won't reveal here was perhaps the one weak point. Unlike the Basil Rathbone wartime pictures there are echoes of Pimpernel Smith in the subsequent not at all bad Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon the antiNazi sentiments of the hero's setpiece speech are not dated or tendentious to modern ears. Indeed Leslie Howard's shadowed intensity remains one of the most effective shots in the film. The only trouble is that it's so good that it becomes a hard scene to top and the actual finale comes off as somewhat trite by comparison.But that's with hindsight. At the time the only thing of which I was fully conscious was that already predisposed in that direction by The Scarlet Pimpernel and Pygmalion I had just become a raving Leslie Howard fan!

	onyx:emotionText "On the face of it I don't ask much of a film only  only!  that it should make me laugh and cry and catch my breath and stir my blood in equal measure. Strange then how rare this seems to be... and how few films earn the final accolade by almost forcing me to review them! I had not the slightest intention this morning of writing about Pimpernel Smith. But now that I sit down afterwards and try to work I find my attention wandering back to it again and again. Clearly I must set down this review or I shall never get anything done... and there can be few stronger tributes to the power of a film.Leslie Howard of course makes or breaks the whole. As producer director and starring actor his name is scrawled  literally  on the film from its opening titles indeed it gives us a chance to recognise the penmanship on the mysterious handwritten notes that recur! Unsurprisingly in some ways this is very much a oneman vehicle. If Leslie Howard's charms escape you the whole production is probably a dead loss  but for any fan of his earlier films it is little short of unalloyed delight.Pimpernel Smith takes much of its resonance from the subtle parallels with Baroness Orczy's story of the Scarlet Pimpernel. The latter is openly referred to only in the title but acknowledged in a dozen ways from the leading character who cloaks an incisive mind beneath a foolish mask to the young acolytes who aid and yet rashly put him at risk the woman who is set to spy out the identity of a beloved one's potential saviour and of course the closed frontiers and despotic arm of a newfledged state  not Revolutionary France but a Nazi Germany not yet at open war.   Above all the echoes lie in the ingenious guises and plans for escape always one twist ahead of both the enemy and the viewers themselves. By the end of the film I was suspecting the most innocent characters of being the nondescript Professor Smith in disguise... and I'm still not certain about the indignant lady on the Cook's Tour!The references however are never obtrusive and always remain subtle and of course perhaps the chief of these is the casting of Leslie Howard himself. Along with a humane and intelligent script it was his outstanding depiction of the title role that raised the 1934 film of The Scarlet Pimpernel above the average. Even today the association is immediate. Less than ten years after the original the dual performance of their star must have been inescapable.From vacuous fop to absentminded professor... and yet it is to Howard's credit that his Professor Smith is not a carbon copy of Sir Percy Blakeney but a distinct and undoubtedly charming character in his own right.   For a moment rapt in admiration of an Aphrodite he is startlingly handsome. But for the most part peering owlishly over a newspaper or buried beneath a deplorable hat he is more the living spit of bespectacled Charles Hawtrey in some postwar Carry On. He has developed the baggy amble to a fine art and the knack of deprecation and inoffensive insolence almost without effort and the role of gentle academic is not a pose but the guiding principle behind all his unlikely impersonations even that of the part of hero. The Professor above all is a man who hates destruction and waste.Passionate screen kisses rarely move me oddly enough a handful of restrained moments of tenderness in this film did. It may be a carefullyscripted star vehicle but few enough of those choose to celebrate the clever and the unassuming. I like Professor Smith very much indeed.But even the quietest hero needs a villain as foil and Francis L. Sullivan is also outstanding here as the elephantine von Graum a Nazi general who turns out to be far less stupid than one might assume. It's hard not to suspect the character of being a lampoon on Goering and from the start we are invited to laugh at him but for all his girth and his struggles with the English sense of humour von Graum is brighter by far than most of his staff and sometimes even one step ahead of the viewer which makes it hard to be complacent on our heroes' behalf.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a relatively obscure film that occasionally appeared on AE and the print was in abysmally awful condition. We ordered a video and discovered the print quality on that was still pretty poor. Nevertheless we still watch it. And we love it. Pimpernel Smith is a wonderful film the brainchild of the great English actor Leslie Howard who was ironically the son of Hungarian immigrants. In film he became the quintessential Englishman and in real life he loved his country as passionately as a man could love anything. His untimely death over the Bay of Biscayne while on a flyby mission for England bore that out.Pimpernel Smith was written produced and directed by Howard who also starred in it and no doubt handpicked its cast. It retells the older story of The Scarlet Pimpernel but is in some ways a stronger movie than its more lavishly produced predecessor. The setting is more modern and accessible to most viewers it has a film noir flavor that is appealing and the enemy is not the mindless tyranny of the French Revolution but the carefully planned and mechanized tyranny of the Third Reich. Its obvious propaganda message is compelling and moving when one recalls the plight of England at the time. Howard made this film to bolster his countrymen and offer hope which it must have done and yet Pimpernel Smith retains a sense of timelessness in its message that tyranny must always be resisted no matter what the cost.As the movie opens the viewer is thrust into a Europe shadowed by Nazi threat where people are routinely rounded up if the state deems them a danger. A medical researcher is arrested but then whisked out from under his captors' noses by a mysterious rescuer who slips the doctor to safety. The Nazis are livid for this unknown savior is their bane and they want him caught as soon as possible.From the European mainland the scene shifts to an English college campus where works Horatio Smith an archeology professor who fusses over his prized statue of Aphrodite is absentminded and late for everything and eschews social engagements. The only woman in his life is the aforementioned statue. His students think he's a few bricks shy of a full load he keeps his superior in a state of confusion and Horace exasperates his wellmeaning brother. Smith is tolerated as a harmless eccentric and resident laughingstock though brilliant he's also borderline dysfunctional.It is naturally an act one carefully cultivated to disarm people so Smith can go about his real business of rescuing those endangered by the Nazis. As an archaeologist he's free to travel Europe and he comes up with a plan to take his students with him on a hunt for traces of a lost Aryan civilization. The young men sniff and sneer but a trip to the continent is irresistible and off they go. The Nazis meanwhile have a secret weapon of their own a seductive and beautiful young woman named Ludmilla Koslowski who spies for them. She does this because her beloved father is a Nazi prisoner and she hopes to secure his release.Ludmilla meets Smith and finds him oddly compelling though he for his part does his best to keep his distance from her. She concludes that he must be the elusive rescuer. The Nazi general for whom she works laughs at her suggestion for Smith has already ingratiated himself to the general as an annoying little English pest. Ludmilla however knows she's right and comes to Smith's room to plead with him to help her father. Apparently unmoved by her plight the professor falls in love with her and later communicates to her that he will rescue her imprisoned father. How he does so is ingenious employing his students as erstwhile journalists and parlaying the Nazis into unwitting assistants. The rest of the film concerns a trap laid for Smith using poor Ludmilla as bait.Pimpernel Smith was Leslie Howard's last film and somehow that seems in keeping with the way he died. The final scene in which he says from the shadows that he will always be back is haunting for he wouldn't be able to return in the flesh. It is Mr. Howard's spirit that returns time and again when this deeply personal movie of his is played. This film remains an important reminder that tyranny under any guise must be constantly fought no matter what it takes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Leslie Howard starred during his younger years in the original 1934 version of The Scarlet Pimpernel the story of an Englishman named Sir Percival Blakeney who rescues aristocrats during the French Revolution. However I actually preferred this World War II version Pimpernel Smith to both the original Scarlet Pimpernel and its 1982 remake starring Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour.This movie set in pre war 1939 tells the story of the unassuming British Professor Horatio Smith who takes a group of his students on an archaeological dig in Nazi Germany. These students much to their amazement discover that this dig is merely a front for their professor's true purpose which is to rescue intellectuals artists  other enemies of the Third Reich and arrange for their safe passage out of Germany.Howard is perfect as the absent minded socially inept and rather eccentric professor. Also while in Germany the group encounters a beautiful woman Ludmilla who is being forced to act as a Gestapo agent hoping to obtain the release of her father whom the Nazis are holding as prisoner. This enhances Professor Smith's character development and adds romance  some tender moments to the tale. Hitherto the only woman in the professor's life has been a statue of Aphrodite in his college campus back in England! The Nazis in this movie are portrayed essentially as idiots totally lacking any sense of humour. Professor Smith on the other hand is constantly witty. The very purpose of his archaeological dig to determine whether or not an Ayran civilization actually existed in Germany of course totally mocks the entire Master Race nonsense of the Third Reich though the Nazis here are far too dumb to perceive the ridicule. In fact the apparently bumbling but actually very clever Smith is able to snatch his intellectuals right out from under these Nazis' noses! By the way you'll always think of this movie whenever you chance to hear the tune 'Tavern in the Town'.The movie has less swashbuckling derring do than The Scarlet Pimpernel but does boast an engrossing and suspenseful plot a cat  mouse game with some tense moments. However the film's main asset in my opinion is its message that quiet unassuming people can make unlikely heroes not just the obvious tough guy superheroes and can accomplish great if unheralded deeds. Also people may sometimes be other than what they appear! It's always interesting to watch these old war movies. The original British audience back in 1941 would have been in the darkest wartime months and of course not have realized the eventual outcome of World War II. This hopeful  uplifting tale must have cheered them up. I was also interested to note that Howard himself was killed when his plane was shot down by Germans during a flight returning home from what may have been a spy mission to Lisbon.".

He was returning from a 'lecture tour' which was certainly propaganda and may well have had intelligence connotations via Portugal and the civilian plane he was on was shot down over the bay of Biscay. It's still not clear if this was an accident or a deliberate target but if the latter it's as likely that Howard's accountant who bore a strong resemblance to Churchill may have been the target.Also look out Violette Cunningham the assistant in the cosmetic shop. She was Howard's last love  despite still being married to Ruth he fell for Violette who also appears in the German dinner scene in 'The First of the Few'. It broke his heart when she died of cerebral meningitis in 1942.".

It's still not clear if this was an accident or a deliberate target but if the latter it's as likely that Howard's accountant who bore a strong resemblance to Churchill may have been the target.Also look out Violette Cunningham the assistant in the cosmetic shop. She was Howard's last love  despite still being married to Ruth he fell for Violette who also appears in the German dinner scene in 'The First of the Few'. It broke his heart when she died of cerebral meningitis in 1942.";

He was a learned man and gave to all his roles on either side of the Atlantic a suave sophistication that appealed both here and in the states.But what we loved about him most was his unswerving patriotism. His love of this country more evident during the war years was something he lived by and eventually was something he gave his life for and we all herald him a hero in our midst. A truly great Englishman and one we can all be proud of. To us he was the sort of Englishman we all wanted to be and to Americans he was the Englishmen on whom all others would be judged from that day forward.In Pimpernel Smith he all but reprises his roll as The Scarlett Pimpernel from the 1934 film of the same name. This time the action takes place in 1939 and our modern day Sir Percy is an architect on an expedition in Germany where our hero has the chance to rescue innocent political prisoners incarcerated by the Nazis.There is very little gun play or physical violence at all but we get plenty of entertainment by the casual and almost comedic performance by Howard as the foppish Smith who whilst convincing the Germans he is a scatter brained professor constantly outsmarts and outwits them as he steals the 'enemies of the Reich' from under their very noses.Ultra patriotic and echoing Howard's own antiNazi views Pimpernel Smith is an espionage great with a powerful message to deliver.I love the speech he makes at the end about how the Germans will never find a horizon and as how one day they will be lost and they will be doomed. Also the line I'll be back we'll all be back gives an almost spine chilling prediction of Dday. Three years before Dday and four years before the final victory it is amazing just how accurate Howard's words were words made more powerful with our knowledge that Howard himself would not live to see either event.One of the best British propaganda films of the war years it has enough elements here to have your British hearts souring with pride re the Rupert Brooke quote and enough to keep you on the edge of whatever you may be sitting on at the time.Look out also for a young David 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' Tomlinson as one of Smith's students.".

Then the camera tracks across to a ragged scarecrow and pans slowly down its arm. Blood!";

	schema:headline " Superb plot WW II thriller and propaganda movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Pimpernel Smith is a superb wartime film about rescuing scientists from Nazi Germany. It's a fictional story that takes its cues from the earlier books and films about The Scarlet Pimpernel. Leslie Howard plays Professor Horatio Smith. He is an archaeologist from Cambridge University who says he's on a quest to find evidence of the Aryan civilization. But in reality he digs the Allied cause. The setting for the film is just before September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland to start World War II. Francis Sullivan is General von Graum the head of the gestapo. He's not a dumb Nazi but cunning and committed. The large cast includes college students scientists underground characters German soldiers gestapo men and others. All of the cast are very good in their roles. Other reviewers discuss the story and actors. Those who are interested in the background of the film and its significance for the time may like more information. The following is a brief overview. Baroness Emma Orczy de Orci was still alive in 1941 when Leslie Howard and British National Films made this movie. Pimpernel Smith borrows its plot and part of its name from de Orci's 1903 play and 1905 book. The Scarlet Pimpernel was a big hit. In 1934 Howard played Sir Percy Blakeney in the movie of the same title that set the standard for all film versions to follow. Indeed all but the 1982 TV film with Anthony Andrews in the role pale in comparison. In 1940 De Orci had just written the last of a dozen sequels to her original. In the meantime Scottish author A.G. Macdonell had written a story 'Pimpernel' Smith that brought the famous rescuer up to the time of World War II. One wonders if Macdonell Howard or others consulted de Orci about the 1941 film. Did Howard correspond with her about it? Would she have approved and been pleased? Howard was interested in a rescue type film against Nazi Germany as early as 1938. After Macdonell's modern Pimpernel Smith came out Howard made this film his project from start to finish. He coproduced directed and starred in it. Besides being a firstrate wartime thriller Pimpernel Smith is one of the best propaganda films ever made. It was highly regarded as such from its opening early in WW II. The movie was released in Great Britain on July 28 1941 and around the rest of the U.K. in the days that followed. It wasn't released in the U.S. until February 12 1942 after America had entered the war. But it was a big success there as well as in the U.K. It was the third most popular movie in England in 1941. In the U.S. it was released under the title Mister V. Pimpernel Smith may have inspired Sweden's Raoul Wallenberg whose efforts in 1944 saved many thousand Hungarian Jews from Nazi death camps. Wallenberg's story has been told in several documentaries and two movies. Wallenberg A Hero's Story was a 1985 Paramount movie made for TV. Good Morning Mr. Wallenberg is a Swedish film from 1990. When Pimpernel Smith reached Sweden in November 1943 it was banned by the Swedish Film Censorship Board. The Swedes feared for their continued neutrality during the war because of the portrayal of the Germans in the movie. But Wallenberg and his sister saw the film at a private screening. She later said that he was impressed by the movie and said he would like to do something like that. Since 1941 he had been traveling frequently to Hungary as a businessman. By 1944 he would be a special envoy for Sweden to Hungary as well as a contact for the American OSS. He made it his mission to help save Hungarian Jews. Wallenberg did save many thousand Austrian Jews by giving them Swedish passports and secured housing. But his fate is unknown. After the Soviet Army took Budapest in 1944 Wallenberg disappeared. He was summoned to Soviet headquarters and was never heard from again. The later movies books and articles conjecture about his final end. While no one can be sure and actual evidence has never surfaced as to when or how he died there's no doubt that he died or was killed while a prisoner of the Soviet Union. And Leslie Howard himself would not survive World War II. Howard was too old for military service  he was 46 at the start of WW II in 1939. But he worked feverishly in his trade against the Nazis. He made several documentaries and starred in a number of World War II films. His other films included 49th Parallel of 1941 Spitfire aka First of the Few of 1942 and The Gentle Sex of 1943. After his last film in America  Gone With the Wind of 1939 in which he plays Ashley Wilkes Howard returned to England to help with the war effort. But he was killed on June 1 1943. He was one of 17 passengers on KLM Royal Dutch AirlinesBOAC Flight 777. It was enroute from Lisbon Portugal to Bristol England when German fighters shot down the DC3 over the Bay of Biscay. The plane was off the coast of France 500 miles West of Bordeaux. Leslie Howard is one of the great film and stage actors of all time.".

First I found it hard to believe that some of the students such as David Maxwell were much less than middleaged and indeed Hugh McDermott was 33 and 3 months in July 1941. After World War I there were a lot of older men in universities as they had been called up from school but I don't think this was true in 1939 before the second lot of trouble with Germany started. Second did young Americans in 1939 really say things like a rough house is just my meat when they meant they enjoyed a bit of a fight? I doubt it. It sounded very antiquated stilted out of tone with the rest of the dialogue there. By the way McDermott was of course British and his supposedly American accent here is a bit odd at times too.Third I recognize that Leslie Howard had an awful lot to do on this movie but his attention to detail lapsed in the moment when the professor walks through a college cloister and recites a snatch from the first stanza of Jabberwocky Twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble .... In gyre and gimble he makes both Gs hard but this is correct only in gimble. A fastidious learned professor would  and actor of Howard's stature surely should  know that gyre is a perfectly good English word going back centuries and that like gyrate and gyroscope it begins with a soft G that is it sounds like jyre. There is no plot reason for Prof. Smith to pretend to get it wrong as I see it the point of him reciting the lines is that he is a dreamer rather otherworldly and fond of such things as this rhyme from a fantasy for children written by an eccentric mathematics don not that he is not sufficiently erudite to pronounce such a word as this correctly. Indeed if he were really chiefly a working secret agent only pretending to be a Cambridge scholar he would be more likely to make such a mistake if it were a deliberate error by the professor it would be counterproductive. Therefore it is an error by the actordirector not an error deliberate or otherwise by the character.".

Howard's function in this film as Professor Horatio Smith is to liberate as many scientists intellectuals writers and other opponents of the Third Reich.

As in so many other films of this period the mention of slave labor camps and of concentration camps only make postwar denial all the more nonsensical both by the Axis and by the Allies. Of course in a British film of conflict between the Brits and the Huns the British triumpha fair conclusion for American audiences. How good a film is this? As a spy movie it is very good however at times the action dwindles in the midst of British propaganda about German propaganda. Somewhat curious is that fact that Howard is not listed in the writing credits especially since the dialogue seems to have his style attached to it.

My mother had Anna Sewell's Black Beauty on the shelf but it didn't appeal to someone more interested in Tolkien and Twain. Horses were fun to ride but could you do that in a book? Teenage boredom finally forced open the pages of Black Beauty and the horse was out of the barn. The story was immediately captivating because Ms. Sewell creates a wonderful animal character and tells the story from the horse's pointofview.And you believed it.Now you don't. In this adaptation the allimportant personality of the horse Black Beauty is almost nonexistent and the story is altered extensively  it really only vaguely resembles the original novel. Paramount filmmakers might have tried a narration to evoke some of the original's first person narrative but they didn't. The animal's personality could still come through as it does with Lassie and other animals but it doesn't. So we are left with a human protagonist cute Mark Lester as Joe Evans who doesn't seem all that engaged in the role and doesn't horse around for long. Chris Menges' photography is quite nice though.

	schema:headline " Decent film but not great";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie that can be looked at one of two ways. You can look at it as an adaptation of Anna Sewell's classic novel or you can look at it as a story about a bunch of people who all happen to own the same horse. I'll do both.As an adaptation of the novel this movie disappoints terribly. The plot bears almost no relation to the original story. Classic characters like John Manly Reuben Smith and Jerry Barker are cut out completely. New characters are often shallow and onedimensional. Ginger one of the most important horses in the story acting as a foil for Black Beauty and with her own heartwrenching story is turned into a gelding given about three seconds of screen time and has no involvement in the actual story. The plot particularly the ways in which Beauty passes from owner to owner often seems contrived. On more than one occasion Beauty is simply standing around in the middle of nowhere and someone comes along and finds him. Other times he performs some heroic deed which would merit his owners deciding to keep him forever and the next thing we know he's being sold again. While the novel deeply explores the society of the time and the effects of that society for better or for worse on both the humans and the animals this movie disregards that aspect entirely. It portrays some rather stereotypical views. Worse some of the bad guys are just that bad guys with no depth or personality. Take for instance the young squire who is cruel for no reason and loves to hurt horses just for the fun of it.As a movie with complete disregard to the book it isn't half bad. The story as it is presented here is not about the horse it is about all the different people who own the horse. Beauty isn't a character so much as he is a plot device. If you don't mind the focus shifting from animal to human it is an enjoyable sequence of stories. I stand by what I said earlier about many of the characters being onedimensional but when the entire cast is reviewed as a whole it displays a wide range of personalities and backgrounds. There is a good balance between kind and cruel owners. Pacing was fairly good. The movie had a nice balance with enough action but not too much. Cinematography was very nice. Many of the shots of the countryside were beautifully done if occasionally somewhat overdone. Most of the stories were fairly standard plots a decent farmer at the mercy of a heartless bank young lovers forbidden from meeting but some such as the circus family were rather creative and even the recycled plots were well done. Acting was good overall.My conclusion A good animal and people story but if you want something closer to the source watch the 1994 version.".

What disappointment we had when it was apparent that we weren't watching 'Black Beauty' but a bastardized story with less than good acting. All through the movie we both wondered aloud whether we had ordered a wrong movie by mistake. Almost all of the characters in the book are absent and the most egregious omission is that the horse is not the narrator. The top billed Mark Lester was less than himself and only in the movie briefly. The other characters are mostly one dimensional and their stories are only glossed over. Of course this is not a miniseries and probably couldn't delve into all of their stories but some story transitions leave me wanting something more.  Spoiler  I thought I heard the soldier who briefly owns Black Beauty volunteered to go to India but in the battle scene it is clear that the people he is fighting are not Indians. Oh and how did this movie got a 'G' rating with such violent battle scene? Someone should have warned me and my eight year old daughter. Viewers who want to watch a movie based on the book should be warned that this one ain't so.".

Many user reviews have been dismissive of this film due to the differences between it and the original novel. But I say who cares! I have never read the book but I have seen a 1990's film version which is more faithful with the inclusion of the Ginger story line so go and watch that and stop moaning! I found this an incredibly moving story and I thoroughly enjoyed Black Beauty's journey which goes full circle in a sad but slightly rewarding way which is enough to leave you with a sense of satisfaction albeit with a tear in your eye. This movie crams a lot into its 90 minutes and the pace is fast but somehow gives the viewer time to soak up the emotional road our equestrian hero is thrust along including all the ups and downs he has to endure. Highlights for me are when Beauty ends up on the Continent after being sold to a travelling circus and thereafter gifted to a humiliated hussar by his estranged lover becoming in the process a war hero after the horse charges with its mortally wounded master into the enemy cannon. More sad times follow as Beauty is brought and sold finally almost expiring due to his ill treatment but just as the old horse drags heavy coals up a steep road and the tired animal is close to death redemption comes at last. The final words are very sad as it gives you the feeling that so much of the horse's life has been used without any real joy and yet we see the old warrior sent to pasture in a field where horses live out their final days. I wish more films were made like this today the music is very good and invokes the broad hills and mountains that feature so prominently Ireland and Spain were used as the filming locations".

However this movie does not manage to do any of those two things and I think that's the problem with the movie. Despite being titled Black Beauty the movie's primary focus is on the human characters in the movie instead of the horse. In fact the horse is often an afterthought and we certainly never get a feeling of what the horse is feeling or thinking. While the movie has these major flaws the movie isn't awful  it looks nice the human drama is sometimes interesting and there are no slow spots. But viewers who think they are going to get a story about a horse will likely be somewhat disappointed. By the way while the movie got a G rating back in 1971 some mild language violence and some mature themes would earn the movie a PG rating today.".

It's quite obvious that several reviewers have either forgotten everything they ever knew about the book or more likely never read it at all. If you are looking for a movie version of the book to watch look elsewhere. So it's just a film about the life of a horse and as such it is soso. The beginning of the movie does have some beautiful shots set as it is in the British countryside somewhere. But it pretty much goes downhill after that becoming a series of vignettes about Black Beauty's various owners with little in the way of real depth and even less focus on the horse himself. It's reasonably entertaining for a rainy day. Older children would likely enjoy it most. I am personally unlikely to watch it again and will be checking out the other versions in the hopes of finding something resembling a reasonably faithful adaptation.".

Hope you don't mind.'. The lives of Mitch and his wife Abby Jeanne Triplehorn are completely and drastically changed when he is hired by the firm setting up a disorienting atmosphere especially when strange things start happening people getting killed by boat bombs and whatnot. Gary Busey plays a small seedy role and it works really well because he's best at playing seedy characters. Ed Harris also delivers a good performance as an FBI agent trying to coerce McDeere into helping them investigate the big bad firm. It seems that McDeere has been helping the firm in its illegal activities making him guilty without him even knowing about it. If he doesn't help the FBI he'll go to jail with the other 40 members of that big happy family. The Firm really gets going once McDeere starts trying to investigate making copies of incriminating files etc. Some things may have gone a little too far like the conveniently placed pillow truck but as a whole The Firm is a great thriller. It may not be quite as good as other John Grisham adaptations The Rainmaker in particular but The Firm's complex and fascinating plot as well as good direction and acting makes it way above average.".

Tom Cruise also plays a great Mitch McDeere with a lot of intensity and charisma. You cheer for him as the protagonist. Holly Hunter is topnotch with her portrayal of the vulnerable secretary turned accomplice Tammy. Gene Hackman is also great as Avery Tolar the one bad guy who sympathizes with Mitch and Abby. Such a great screen presence. His scenes while they're in the Kaymen Islands are key ones to watch. Jeanne Tripplehorn finally makes up for her role in Basic Instinct as Abby McDeere the cheated wife not only by her husband but also by the firm he works for. Sydney Pollack showcases some of his best work as director especially by the opening segment that describes Mitch McDeere perfectly in the span of less than 10 minutes. Such a GREAT adaptation and a even better film to watch!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Firm 1993The twist in the plot as you realize this Memphis law firm is not what it seems and the rather innocent freshman lawyer played by Tom Cruise is slow to catch on is the core of the movie and a relief. It starts steadily or slowly depending on your patience and in fact plays many scenes out in more detail than we need for a kind of bookish thriller. It's not a bad ride and there are some further minor twists but it's not packed tightly enough or frankly original enough to lift its boots out of the sand.Director Sydney Pollack hugely successful as a director and actor might have just had bad scriptwriting here by David Rabe because John Grisham's book had proved itself. The acting is really solid I'm no Cruise fan but he's fine but the characters are often doing things that just don't quite follow or that are improbable or stupid. Or they end up doing something dangerous and the danger is either watered down or ridiculous. Examples that come to mind are how they show Cruise discovering or stealing or xeroxing files. We get the plot but it lumbers along or is just shown not built up with suspense. The cinematographer takes a hit here I think. Things are often nicely framed and routinely well done but a thriller needs to hide some things show some things create ambiance and mystery and so on visually.

	onyx:emotionText "The Firm 1993The twist in the plot as you realize this Memphis law firm is not what it seems and the rather innocent freshman lawyer played by Tom Cruise is slow to catch on is the core of the movie and a relief. It starts steadily or slowly depending on your patience and in fact plays many scenes out in more detail than we need for a kind of bookish thriller. It's not a bad ride and there are some further minor twists but it's not packed tightly enough or frankly original enough to lift its boots out of the sand.Director Sydney Pollack hugely successful as a director and actor might have just had bad scriptwriting here by David Rabe because John Grisham's book had proved itself. The acting is really solid I'm no Cruise fan but he's fine but the characters are often doing things that just don't quite follow or that are improbable or stupid. Or they end up doing something dangerous and the danger is either watered down or ridiculous. Examples that come to mind are how they show Cruise discovering or stealing or xeroxing files. We get the plot but it lumbers along or is just shown not built up with suspense. The cinematographer takes a hit here I think. Things are often nicely framed and routinely well done but a thriller needs to hide some things show some things create ambiance and mystery and so on visually. It doesn't really happen.So for a kind of technical highstakes rich person's goodguy badguy suspense film it will get you through but barely. By the last five minutes if you aren't sucked in you'll want to scream hurry up!";

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Cruise the All American kid from the trailer park who worked his way through Harvard Law School just got the dream job with a prestigious white shoe law firm in Memphis Tennessee. Sounds like he's on his way to the top with wife Jeanne Tripplehorn. But it turns out to be a nightmare. This Firm's main client is a Chicago crime family and they launder the mob's money. Now the FBI in the persons of fatherly Steven Hill and hardnosed Ed Harris are squeezing Cruise to infiltrate and get incriminating information. That would result in disbarment for violating lawyerclient privilege. And The Firm isn't a gang of boy scouts either. They're not above a little blackmail and entrapment and they've got a security man in Wilford Brimley who's real good at it.How Tom Cruise gets out of this rock and a hard place situation is the plot of The Firm. Sydney Pollak gave him one stylish cast in support and everyone of them delivers. Even players like Gary Busey Hal Holbrook Gene Hackman take essentially supporting roles because this film was a guaranteed blockbuster. All of John Grisham's novels have their own built in audience The Firm is no exception. I do remember my mother was a devoted reader of his work whereas I always await the film version.Holly Hunter got an Oscar nomination for her small role as private detective Gary Busey's secretary and girl Friday. When Hunter witnesses Busey's murder without the hit men knowing it she sets the wheels in motion for the downfall of the bad guys. Hunter got nominated for Best Actress for The Piano and Best Supporting Actress for The Firm a most unusual occurrence. She won for The Piano in 1993 but lost the Supporting Actress Award to her costar in The Piano Anna Paquin. Winning both would have just been a bit too much for the Academy voters.The Firm has a far fetched plot to be sure in the way that Tom Cruise brings them all down. Still that's the charm of it. It's almost Hitchcockian in its pace and mood and even more resembles the Mission Impossible television series in the way it's all brought off. Small wonder that Tom Cruise was chosen to star in the big screen adaptations of that television classic.When I watch The Firm I'm reminded of that line from another television classic that one Hannibal Smith used to say about he loved it when a plan comes together. That's what you will like about The Firm.".

The casting was really really great and the plot was first rate. Cruise is a fresh out of college law student named Mitch with a pretty new wife who is dreaming of becoming a successful and big name lawyer. So as any other graduate he is sending out resumes and getting offers from different firms. But one firm from Memphis Tennessee gives him an offer he can't refuse. It seems like a small homegrown firm that is very wealthy and prosperous and prides itself on being the best. But this isn't any ordinary law firm. It's a Family with a history of partners having premature deaths and now Mitch is part of it. And he can't get out. Not alive anyways. So Mitch has to find a way out without joining the list of expired former associates. Gene Hackman in this is incredibly stunningly unbelievably great. His character quickly becomes Cruise's mentor. He is an unhappy alcoholic womanizing ambulance chaser albeit an highly powerful and prosperous one who also cannot escape either and is the linchpin in the unfolding drama that Cruise and Tripplehorn find themselves square in the middle of. Hackman is the one you should despise and dislike right from the beginning but you can't even if you try very hard because he is a likable person and you know he is in serious trouble which makes you emphasize with him right from the get go. My favorite Grisham book adaptation it made him a household name to this very day. Also features appearances by Paul Sorvino Gary Busey and Holly Hunter.".

	schema:headline " Caught In A Trap";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who has experienced poverty or hardship in their early life never forgets the experience and always retains a certain element of insecurity about wealth regardless of how much financial success they later achieve. In The Firm it's this phenomenon that essentially drives a brilliant young law student to ignore numerous offers of careerenhancing opportunities from a number of prestigious big city law firms to instead join a small Memphis partnership who offer him a fantastic remuneration package. Unfortunately what follows perfectly illustrates the wisdom of the old adage that if something seems too good to be true it probably is.Mitch McDeere Tom Cruise is the Harvard Law School graduate from a poor background whose exceptional academic achievements lead to him being headhunted by Berdini Lambert  Locke. The firm offer him a huge salary a lowinterest mortgage a Mercedes and the repayment of his student loans and in return Mitch readily agrees to join them. After relocating to Memphis with his wife Abby Jeanne Tripplehorn he quickly settles into the practice and regularly works long hours. Initially he's comfortable with the firm's family ethos and doesn't share Abby's unease about some of the advice she receives such as the firm encourages children etc. A little later however when he realises that a high percentage of the firm's work is related to the activities of the Mob and a couple of the firm's lawyers suddenly die in mysterious circumstances he gets the strong feeling that something sinister is going on.Mitch's suspicions are confirmed when he gets approached by the director of the FBI and Agent Wayne Tarrance Ed Harris who inform him about the firm's criminal and moneylaundering activities. They want Mitch to supply them with information and documents to be used as evidence to bring his employers to justice and add that if he doesn't cooperate things will be made very difficult for his brother who's in jail facing a manslaughter charge. They also emphasise that Mitch effectively doesn't have any choice in the matter because no partner has ever left the firm alive and if he simply decides to stay with the firm he could face 20 years in prison when they go down as they inevitably will.Mitch knows it would be impossible to pass on the documents that the FBI want without breaching the confidence of his legitimate clients and taking that action would inevitably lead to the loss of his licence to practice law. He therefore realises that in order to meet their demands without losing his career making his brother's parlous situation worse or winding up dead at the hands of his ruthless employers or the Mob he needs to devise an imaginative plan to get out of the trap he's in.

	onyx:emotionText "Anyone who has experienced poverty or hardship in their early life never forgets the experience and always retains a certain element of insecurity about wealth regardless of how much financial success they later achieve. In The Firm it's this phenomenon that essentially drives a brilliant young law student to ignore numerous offers of careerenhancing opportunities from a number of prestigious big city law firms to instead join a small Memphis partnership who offer him a fantastic remuneration package. Unfortunately what follows perfectly illustrates the wisdom of the old adage that if something seems too good to be true it probably is.Mitch McDeere Tom Cruise is the Harvard Law School graduate from a poor background whose exceptional academic achievements lead to him being headhunted by Berdini Lambert  Locke. The firm offer him a huge salary a lowinterest mortgage a Mercedes and the repayment of his student loans and in return Mitch readily agrees to join them. After relocating to Memphis with his wife Abby Jeanne Tripplehorn he quickly settles into the practice and regularly works long hours. Initially he's comfortable with the firm's family ethos and doesn't share Abby's unease about some of the advice she receives such as the firm encourages children etc. A little later however when he realises that a high percentage of the firm's work is related to the activities of the Mob and a couple of the firm's lawyers suddenly die in mysterious circumstances he gets the strong feeling that something sinister is going on.Mitch's suspicions are confirmed when he gets approached by the director of the FBI and Agent Wayne Tarrance Ed Harris who inform him about the firm's criminal and moneylaundering activities. They want Mitch to supply them with information and documents to be used as evidence to bring his employers to justice and add that if he doesn't cooperate things will be made very difficult for his brother who's in jail facing a manslaughter charge. They also emphasise that Mitch effectively doesn't have any choice in the matter because no partner has ever left the firm alive and if he simply decides to stay with the firm he could face 20 years in prison when they go down as they inevitably will.Mitch knows it would be impossible to pass on the documents that the FBI want without breaching the confidence of his legitimate clients and taking that action would inevitably lead to the loss of his licence to practice law. He therefore realises that in order to meet their demands without losing his career making his brother's parlous situation worse or winding up dead at the hands of his ruthless employers or the Mob he needs to devise an imaginative plan to get out of the trap he's in. When he then discovers that the firm have routinely been overbilling clients for some considerable time he starts to see an opportunity to formulate just such a plan but of course its success is by no means guaranteed.Based on John Grisham's bestselling novel this glossy thriller was understandably a huge boxoffice success.

And it can't be denied that one of their most amazing aspects is that they are perfectly fitted to be adapted onto the big screen. I wanted to watch this film since the time that I have finished reading The Firm this amazing book which turned Grisham into a world class writer. I craved for more of its pure excellence. I just needed to see Sydney Pollack's vision. And I am so happy to say right now that he certainly didn't let me down.Tom Cruise still in his early days of glory is an ideal Mitch McDeere the young ambitious and somehow innocent young lawyer. The man just passed the bar exam and started looking for a job. And then he found what he thought was a perfect opportunity for a wellpaid job of his dreams. Unfortunately this all seemed a bit too good to be totally legit and riskfree. But at the time who could tell that this particular firm is controlled by a group of dangerous Mafia thugs?This is the moment when the fun starts. The fastpaced sequences begin to roll. The viewer starts to uncover one secret after another of the overly corrupted Bendini Lambert  Locke law firm. The suspense is heightening with every scene and that is what makes you concentrated all the time. You simply don't want to miss any part of the action. And I can assure everybody it won't stop until the last minute. This is what makes the movie so similar to the book  you just can't stop till you know the whole story all the way through. Of course they had to do some rewrites and cut out some of the scenes and subplots even though the movie is still relatively long. This is probably why the movie seems a bit chaotic at times. Also I didn't like what the did with the ending it should have stayed as it was described in the book.On another topic I love the way that all of the great supporting characters build up the plot. And the stars that play them. One of the most memorable cameos of this movie must be the one made by Gary Busey. The only person that really didn't convince me was Jeanne Tripplehorn. I pictured Mitch's wife very differently  let's just say she seemed more beautiful and appealing in my mind. However that still didn't stop Gene Hackman's character as he tried to seduce her in the most adorable way one of the best scenes in my opinion.Even though I found the book more exciting than the movie I still highly recommend it for its everoccurring suspense and the atmosphere that causes shivers on the back. You won't find many law thrillers like this one for sure  except maybe for other Grisham masterpieces.810".

	schema:reviewBody "John Grisham fairly burst on the scene with the very definition of a pageturner in the legal thriller The Firm. His novel is slick manipulative undeniably fastpaced and suspenseful. Keep those last two terms in mind because fastpaced and suspenseful can never be ascribed to the stillborn ponderous mess that Sydney Pollack perpetrates on the viewer.The storyline centers on idealistic young attorney Tom Cruise who joins a prestigious Southern law firm that ends up having ties to organized crime and begins to take control of his life. The novel details the dawning realization and horror that the attorney and his wife face when it is discovered that they are basically owned by The Firm and their lives are in danger should they ever step out of line. The film details pretty much the same story with some rather wrongheaded derivations and devoid of any tensions or excitement.The cast is par excellence. There is not even a minor role not inhabited by a firstrate actor. Cruise is ideally cast as the attorney. Gene Hackman is reliable as his mentor at the firm. Unfortunately of the remaining cast only Holly Hunter makes much of an impression as a canny private detective's secretary who ends up helping the lead couple. Jeanne Tripplehorn spends much of the film looking constipated as Cruise's wife. The film offers her a midway revelation that results in her spending an obscene amount of time moping on a set of swings. The various shady characters at the firm that instilled such fear and distrust in the novel are inhabited on screen by a diversity of nonthreatening retirement age actors  like Hal Holbrook. And to play the terrifying head of security and enforcer of the firm  the man that no one wants to mess with  Pollack casts Wilford Brimley  the avuncular grandfather figure from the oat bran commercials. Apparently Pollack was going for irony but it blows up in his face. There is something to be said when Ed Harris' relatively sympathetic FBI agent comes off as more of a threat than the assassins dogging Cruise. With the likes of Holbrook and Brimley out to get him Cruise just has to rev up to a hearty shuffle in order to avoid them.The pace is the film's worst problem. It is stagnant from start to finish. There is literally no stretch of excitement in the entire film based on a novel that was swimming in it. Part of the issue is that Pollack seems to think the story is of biblical importance and needs to be portrayed with unflagging solemnity  in short he is too good to stoop to a thrill. The film is tragically overlong and easily feels like triple the length it is. Anything that was remotely exciting from the novel has been removed or depicted in such a painfully tedious fashion lest one break a sweat.Even worse changes made in the story and the outcome in particular make no sense. The true evil of the firm was actually the organized crime syndicate that it fronted for. In the film the organized crime syndicate is depicted as almost a neutral figure that can be won over by Cruise's reasoning and savvy while the firm itself it depicted as the ultimate evil HUH?. We never truly feel that Cruise and Tripplehorn are ever in any serious danger and that coupled with the staggering pace and running time gives us no rooting interest in the outcome. And when the outcome is as weak as it is here one is just as happy not to wait around for it.The score sounds like lowrent jazz and often detracts even further from the action.This production is a veritable textbook on how not to adapt a popular pageturner. A lumbering tortuous joyless mess devoid of tension suspense excitement or any recognizable human emotion. Even the most undiscerning viewers will find themselves looking at their watches and tapping their feet prior to the halfway mark. A complete misfire and a total dud  this film is indeed painful.".

I enjoyed every minute of this intense thriller from the beginning until the surprise ending though I'm tempted to tell what happens I'll let you find out for yourself!.  I tell a bit of the story here so it is possible they may be regarded as SPOILERS so if you don't want to know anything about the movie STOP READING.Tom Cruise shows off one of his best performances as Mitch McDeere the formally poor boy who goes off to Harvard Law School and graduates cume laude.  He goes to many prestigious firms all of whom want him real bad. One firm though Bendini Lambert and Locke strikes his interest.  In return for joining he gets 100000 per year and a shiny new Mercedes. He accepts and he and his wife Abby Jeanne Tripplehorn fly to Memphis where they get a nice house with most of it payed for by the firm.  The story unfolds and through the course of events Mitch learns the dark truth about his firm. . .The acting is superb in this film.  Tom Cruise's performance reminds me of his in 'A Few Good Men' strong and realistic.  Jeanne Tripplehorn is a pleasure to watch as his wife Abby.  Gene Hackman plays a surprisingly sympathetic role as a partner in the firm.  Holly Hunter who received an Oscarnomination for her role is almost humorous as a southerntwanged secretaryturned victimturned accomplice.  Ed Harris brings his usual fine acting style as an FBI agent and veteran actor Hal Holbrook plays a grandfatherly lawyer more evil than his attitude would imply.  Sydney Pollack's directing is radiant and the single piano score by Dave Grusin can be both calm and content then become fast and furious.In conclusion 'The Firm' is a fun fresh thriller and it should be enjoyed for years to come.".

In return for joining he gets 100000 per year and a shiny new Mercedes. He accepts and he and his wife Abby Jeanne Tripplehorn fly to Memphis where they get a nice house with most of it payed for by the firm.  The story unfolds and through the course of events Mitch learns the dark truth about his firm. . .The acting is superb in this film.  Tom Cruise's performance reminds me of his in 'A Few Good Men' strong and realistic.  Jeanne Tripplehorn is a pleasure to watch as his wife Abby.  Gene Hackman plays a surprisingly sympathetic role as a partner in the firm.  Holly Hunter who received an Oscarnomination for her role is almost humorous as a southerntwanged secretaryturned victimturned accomplice.  Ed Harris brings his usual fine acting style as an FBI agent and veteran actor Hal Holbrook plays a grandfatherly lawyer more evil than his attitude would imply.  Sydney Pollack's directing is radiant and the single piano score by Dave Grusin can be both calm and content then become fast and furious.In conclusion 'The Firm' is a fun fresh thriller and it should be enjoyed for years to come.";

	schema:reviewBody "Back in the early 1990's movies based on lawyers and law were everything so it's no surprise that many of John Grisham's books were adapted into screen during this time including this movie The Firm. The Firm is actually a really tense characterdriven thriller that works despite a stuffy running time and a very confusing plotespecially the last halfhour. The screenplay is effective but kudos to those who can follow the entirety of the plot because it was hard to follow at times.Sydney Pollack's film is about this very smart man who is on the cusp of graduating from Harvard when he is offered a package at this law firm in Memphis which can afford him an affluent lifestyle. But little does he know the firm has a sinister side. When the FBI talks to him about the firm and asks him to be an insider Mitch McDeere's life will be forever changed.This film has a wellrounded cast and everyone is put to good use. Tom Cruise does a great job using brain and muscle to sort things out. Gene Hackman does a great job as his flawed but kind character. Jeanne Tripplehorn is effective as Mitch's wife Abby. We also get smaller key performances from Ed Harris as the FBI investigator and David Strathairn as Mitch's older brother Ray who is serving time for manslaughter.Overall The Firm is a very interesting movie. The plot is all over the place and the film runs over two and a half hours but the film never becomes boring and it's not all that hard to put the pieces together. I also like the jazzy piano score by Dave Grusin. It sounds upbeat at times but it adds to the film. A very suspenseful thriller and I was surprised how fast my heart was beating in the threeway battle between Mitch the FBI and the Firm. I rate this film 810.".

The theatrical trailer 1 is very good and doesn't even show that much of the movie. My favorite parts of this movie was mainly the ending sequences which I won't go into because you need to see them for yourself. I loved right at the beginning where Tom Cruise's Mitch McDeere's wife gets home and as she's opening the door the door flings open and Mitch grabs her and they go straight for the couch kissing. Then after a few seconds she says Okay. Okay. You're going to have to leave now. I'm expecting my husband. The hell with him he says and shuts the door and takes her into the kitchen.The movie is very good entertaining and I do agree with it being a little farfetched but all a movie is supposed to be is entertainment because it is all fantasy. Even stories based on true events are fantasies because they may not show exactly how certain things took place and that it is a biased story. It only shows how one person viewed something. In any case this movie deserves an 8 or nine out of ten.".

The film's mood pushes the limit of tongue incheek and it is certainly felt as a comedy because after all the premise is a stuttering boy joining a debate team but despite all the hilarious non sequiturs and plotdriven laughs I take that essential theme to heart. Hal Heffner is an innocently gawky young high school kid portrayed in a shouldbe careermaking performance by Reece Thompson who has a severe stuttering problem and experiences a change of events that he finds to have had a tempestuous emotional effect on him that I'm just dying to give away but won't. From this point on we share those emotions because it's nearly impossible not to throw in all your chips for this kid. The reason is because growing up frankly is hard. Once one has done it one doesn't feel like it was as hard as it was but at the time it most definitely was. Watching this film we watch this naive stuttering boy crippled by inhibitions and shyness mature reaching the extremes of anger confusion love intellectual growth and introspection.There are plenty of movies about high school and they're full of comeuppance humor targeted for that age discovery of sex et cetera but there is very very rarely a movie like Rocket Science a movie about that particular time in your life when you were just growing into yourself and you didn't even know it and you hardly look back at that time because of the unawareness of self at that point and hopefully the growth since then. This is an important little film that though it isn't receiving the attention I feel it would and should get with a wider and longer release time will be kind to with great hope.".

	schema:headline " A Neurotic AntiLove Story";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is simply astounding in my opinion. The acting is top notch as well as the soundtrack writing editing and photography.I'll start with the general storyHal Heffner Reece Thompson is just an ordinary  no frills highschool kid who happens to have a severe stutter. He has a somewhat broken home life living with his older bullying thief of a brother Earl Vincent Piazza. Their parents don't get along so well... Hal has a difficult time dealing with his stutter in school as well as general daily life. He is especially shy. Well... Hal is approached by the school Debate Team Star Ginny Ryerson Anna Kendrick and she entices Hal into joining the Plainsboro High Debate Team. Hal develops a fondness for Ginny and desperately attempts to be closer with her. Hilarity Ensues...The Acting in this film is nothing but astonishing. Reece does an incredible job of balancing his lines and creating a very convincing stuttering problem. Not only this but the jokes he has to carry out are lowkey and very natural. The very impressive fastpaced and garbled speech that Anna and Nicholas D'Agosto Ben in the film as well as the other debaters in the film have to employ is incredible. According to Jeff Blitz real debaters speak faster but the ActorsActresses had to slow their speech so that everything was intelligible. Every player in this film speaks so naturally and fluently that the jokes are not obvious. They require thought despite their beautiful simplicity. If you know Wes Anderson films you know what I am talking about.Speaking of the Writing it is once again amazing. The love story that this film illustrates is a very different type of love story. It takes the genre and flips it upsidedown at every turn. This trend also emanates in all other facets of the film as well. Just when your mind thinks one thing is going to happen something unexpected happens. This film is very unpredictable which is very nice as this film does not follow the fairy tales that are so common in film today. Rocket Science is also just beautiful looking. The film was made predominately in the Baltimore Area. The crew did a most convincing job of turning South East Baltimore into Trenton NJ and turning the suburbs of MD into those of NJ. As a Dundalk resident myself I can testify.The editing is also innovative in that it employed its fitting soundtrack into the cutting. The music will fire up to match the sequence and then pause to let a key moment carry itself out and then pick up right where it left off. Speaking of the music The Violent Femmes are all over the place and their songs of Love Angst match perfectly with the entire flow and story of the film.All in all this film was a most enjoyable experience. The laughs I had are unforgettable and the emotions that I felt watching Hal chase his dreams really tapped into me. Its a realistic film with a slight neurotic sitcom twist to it. Jeff Blitz is simply brilliant and it shows in this work. Reese has a most bright future and will be fully discovered once this film hits.For a truly uplifting however realistic experience that will certainly make you laugh and impress as well go see Rocket Science when it releases on August 10th.

It's never glib towards a range bent characters and chooses to leave the smart remarks for the characters and not the film itself. Despite the subject of repressed anger and expressed rage there's a sweetness that avoids the sentimental.Clearly Jeffery Blitz needed to tell this story.

I was extremely pleasantly surprised. It was a very good movie definitely worth seeing. The soundtrack was extremely fitting to the theme of the film as well. It turns out from some of the comments I have read here some people just do not like this film. I cannot find a reason for that. I have noticed that with the younger crowd this movie seems to not be as popular as others. This movie is very linear when it comes to how things really are. You can relate to several main characters and their struggles in life. If you are expecting a slapstick non realistic comedy with tons of shock value go and watch Wedding Crashers which I love by the way. If you want to see a movie with intelligent dialogue with a good message and great acting go and see Rocket Science. My rating 10.".

Their performances were unlike anything I've seen in years!!! I think it's difficult to portray a character that you hate and love quite like Anna has done in this movie and even now.. I'm still wondering..? but mostly it's love  Seriously for the last 2 decades or so Hollywood has been lacking the ability to produce anything that even resembles 'originality' and usually just chews up and spits out a recombination of 3 or 4 stories that have been told time and time again..... and for that reason alone there'll probably be one or two people that won't even appreciate this movie because its not that run of the mill crap they're used too.But honestly whoever put together the cast of this movie deserves a massive pat on the back. I cannot think of another name that could have fit the profile of these characters so perfectly!I question how the hell it got the 'R' rating however?? Come on its language and sexuality content was on par with 'Lost in Translation'.. What the? Whether you're 25 or 12 watch this movie by yourself with no distractions and no one to influence your reactions and you will LOVE this movie it's very clever. I recommend it highly!".

	schema:headline " Best film so far of 2007";
	schema:reviewBody "For some the joys of being a teenager include excelling at sports having a girlfriend or boyfriend being part of a close circle of friends or just having fun. For others there is only the constant feeling of being an outsider looking in. For some even the thought of getting out of bed in the morning to go to school is filled with dread. Case in point  Hal Hefner a fifteen year old attending Plainsboro High School in New Jersey who is trying to make sense of growing up but is burdened by a stutter so debilitating that he cannot even tell the cafeteria worker at school that he wants pizza instead of fish. Rocket Science the second feature by Jeffrey Blitz Spellbound who overcame his own stuttering disability is a teen comedy that poignantly captures the painful loneliness of adolescence.While on paper Rocket Science sounds like other coming of age films such as Election and Rushmore it manages to capture something unique and very special about being a teenager without having to rely on grossness stereotypes or implausible situations. Brilliantly played by Vancouver actor Reece Thompson Hal's sweetness and innocence is totally captivating and we identify with his pain and root for him to succeed. His family support however is virtually nonexistent. His brother Earl Vincent Piazza is a compulsive thief and bully who calls him by girls' names his father has moved out of the house and his mother Lizbeth Bartlett has a Korean boyfriend a Small Claims judge Steve Park who laughs inappropriately and whose son Heston Aaron Yu a bisexual shows an unusual amount of interest in him.Hal has a speech therapist Mr. Lewinsky Maury Ginsberg but he is so incompetent that he tells him that he wishes Hal was hyperactive so he would know how to treat him. Under these circumstances the last place he would want to be is on the high school debating team a collection of driven superconfident word magicians who can speak with authority at breakneck speed on both sides of an issue. Surprisingly however Hal is recruited by top debater Ginny Ryerson Anna Kendrick to be her debate partner after her former partner Ben Wekselbaum Nicholas D'Agosto went blank at last year's championship match.Ginny a charming but overly aggressive super student tells Hal that deformed people make good competitors because they have so much anger to express. Hal's first inclination is to say no but he is so taken with Ginny and flattered that someone could see some possibility in him that he accepts. Giving it the old high school try he stumbles badly both in pursuing his romance and in debating the subject of sexual abstinence in high school so badly in fact that he often has to hide in the janitor's closet from embarrassment.Mr. Lewinsky advises Hal to try singing the words of the debate to the tune of Battle Hymn of the Republic or speaking with a foreign accent and he does both with hilarious effect. Partly out of revenge and partly out of desperation he turns to failed debater Ben Wekselbaum now working in Trenton in a cleaners to be his new partner after Ginny transfers to a different school. The ending is ripe for the big debate in which all the pieces fit neatly together but Blitz does not go there. Instead he relies on the inner strength of the characters to see them through not on a contrived narrative.While there are some predictably oddball characters like Philosophy major Lionel Jonah Hill pintsized Josh Lewis Garrles who spies on Ginny for him and models her bra that he has stolen and an older couple who practice the Kama Sutra and play Violent Femmes Blister In The Sun duets on the cello and piano Rocket Science has few false notes. It is wise honest funny touching and painfully sad with Oscarcaliber performances. It's not rocket science to figure out why it is the best film so far of 2007.".

Giving it the old high school try he stumbles badly both in pursuing his romance and in debating the subject of sexual abstinence in high school so badly in fact that he often has to hide in the janitor's closet from embarrassment.Mr. Lewinsky advises Hal to try singing the words of the debate to the tune of Battle Hymn of the Republic or speaking with a foreign accent and he does both with hilarious effect. Partly out of revenge and partly out of desperation he turns to failed debater Ben Wekselbaum now working in Trenton in a cleaners to be his new partner after Ginny transfers to a different school. The ending is ripe for the big debate in which all the pieces fit neatly together but Blitz does not go there. Instead he relies on the inner strength of the characters to see them through not on a contrived narrative.While there are some predictably oddball characters like Philosophy major Lionel Jonah Hill pintsized Josh Lewis Garrles who spies on Ginny for him and models her bra that he has stolen and an older couple who practice the Kama Sutra and play Violent Femmes Blister In The Sun duets on the cello and piano Rocket Science has few false notes. It is wise honest funny touching and painfully sad with Oscarcaliber performances. It's not rocket science to figure out why it is the best film so far of 2007.";

They are both amazing in their key roles and were this a highprofile Hollywood film would no doubt be considered come Oscar time as well they should be! High school can be a painful time so to expect some Disney version of perfect perky kids who all look like teen models is downright unrealistic. This film on the other hand rang true in just about every scene which is no easy task. And I have to add that I have become a big fan of Margo Martindale who can do just about anything asked of her. See her touching segment in the multisegment film Paris je t'aime and her work in The Riches to get an idea of how terrific this actress is. In any event if you want to see a film that reflects high school in all its goodbadandugly splendor this is one film you should not miss.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hope old Hollywood and what's become the new Hollywood namely the Sundance Film Festival haven't yet established that the angst of suburban high school life really is a metaphor for all those life lessons they want to share with us. Rocket Science is one more in a long line of sensitive and notsosensitive teenage movies. Surprisingly this one is pretty good. On the other hand if you're not prepared early on to recognize lowkey exaggeration to achieve humor and make a point Wait a minute why didn't Hal just point to the pizza? you might leave the theater scratching your head. Hal is Hal Hefner Reese Thompson a schlumping unhappy shy high school student with a stutter. The stutter in fact is more like a series of strangled gargles. He knows the answers he has ideas...and he simply can't get them out. When the captain of the debating team Ginny Ryerson Anna Kendrick recruits him to be her partner it's because she says she can see his potential. Turns out she has some other not so altruistic motives. Hal first finds infatuation and what he thinks is love for this cute smart high school star. He decides he'll join the debate team even though he has never been able to get more than a sentence or two out of his mouth because Ginny wants him to. Hal also has to deal with an older brother who bullies and steals the breakup of his parents' marriage and his mother taking up with the father of a schoolmate. Through it all Hal perseveres. Those who think this movie will be a series of crude jokes and high school hormone scenes will be disappointed. Of course those who think Hal will overcome that strangulating stammer will win Ginny's heart and the two will face a tense debating contest which will leave them state champs...are going to be disappointed too. What Hal faces is a series of struggles and challenges keyed to the awful inexperience and misunderstandings of adolescence. The director and writer Jeffrey Blitz who gave us the documentary Spellbound sets up Hal and his world as a series of situations for Hal to deal with. There is no selfpity from Hal. As the movie progresses we figure out that Hal is not going to have an epiphany of speech or love but that he's going to manage even if just barely at times. Along the way we can enjoy what Blitz gives Hal...a high school speech counselor who only knows about hyperactive kids Hal's continuing battle to deal with the choice of pizza or fish in the cafeteria Ginny Ryerson's neighbors a couple who work through their marriage issues with a cello a piano and a copy of the illustrated Kama Sutra the debate technique of spreading or cramming a breathless fasttalking debate position into 30 seconds ten if you're responding. I hope this is a Blitz invention. It causes some aweinspiring situations...when a debater goes dry when Hal tries when Ginny wows 'em...but it seems as unnatural a part of real debate technique as miniature poodles are to dogs. And at the close? Love shouldn't be as complicated as rocket science Hal says to his father. Most of us over the age of 30 have figured out that it shouldn't be but usually is. Rocket Science is a goodnatured goodhumored movie about a kid with a stammer who is willing to try for the sake of love. Is it a realistic slice of high school life? I wouldn't know. I tried my best to forget my high school years as quickly as I could. For those who enjoy their high school movies filled with doubledealing backstabbing uneasy laughter and wickedly sharp irony you can't do better than Alexander Payne's black comedy Election. Reese Witherspoon's overachieving Tracy Flick would leave Ginny Ryerson with the stammer and Hal Hefner nothing but a moist lump in the janitor's closet.".

I didn't. Maybe i had the wrong idea when i watched this movie i was convinced from start till perhaps the last scene that i was going to see an inspiring transformation where i would no longer feel sorry for the kid and that marred my view on the film. All i could think about during the whole film is not what this kid was talking about what he was thinking about but how he was speaking. Its like a movie where the main character looks like a bunyip all you can think about is this main character looks like a bunyip and not really what heshe is saying. I was convinced the inevitable transformation was going to be in his speaking patterns so i wasn't particularly interested in his views on love because I'm sorry i don't mean to be offensive to anybody but having a speech impediment as BAD as that is something i couldn't bear to hear for the rest of my life you have to try and do something about it. I thought thats what this movie was about! Look I'm sure what the kid was saying was important and meaningful but i was looking for more blunt changes that were imperative to me saying at the end of the movie wow that was good. The stutter was a vehicle to portray a message about love when i went through the whole movie thinking it was the opposite that all the references to love would make him lose his stutter. Not a horrible movie but after i finished watching it i felt horrible Im a bit tired of movie producers thinking 'it will be more meaningful if we deprive the movie of a happy ending'. To be honest i don't need happy endings but what i do need is some light. At the end of 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' i was left thinking despite its lack of a clich happy ending that the main characters were not doomed because of it that they could bounce back from the issues in the movie. I felt at the end of 'Rocket Science' that the kid was never going to get rid of his stutter and when did his last debate and he turned to the judges and said 'Im killing it right?' that he was in fact not killing it he sucked you can't debate in a musical tone there was no growth there. Was it that hard to put a happy ending in!?!".

	schema:headline " best Asian American movie I've seen this year";
	schema:reviewBody "Seriously. I have to agree with the writer of the review at the top of the string of reviews. There's insight and brilliance in the script and in the direction. Movies about high school kids will draw comparisons to all the high school films that preceded it from Hughes to Apatow. Americans we take our high school years very seriously...especially after we graduate. And we all have our favorite movies that deal with those four years of our lives mine Donnie Darko Rushmore and Election. Given time I think Rocket Science will settle somewhere between Election and Napolean Dynamite for me.Rocket Science is unique if you're willing to look beyond the surface similarities. Yes this movie has a young protagonist who wants to overcome the odds to get the girl with the help of friends with interference from an antagonistic sibling and parents who just don't seem to understand. That's practically a classical form by now. Euripides could fill in that outline.Already there are 4 pages of reviews and I can only add this the roles of the Asian Americans that writer and director Jeffrey Blitz carved out deserve comment. And that comment is sweet! Astonishing really. Someone mentioned Juno in these reviews and how Rocket Science achieved where Juno may have fell short. I skipped Juno but listened to at least three separate discussions on public radio and on the local AM stations about the Chinesebaby line used in the promotions. I understand that in the context of the movie it wasn't so bad. Nothing nearly that clumsy in Rocket Science. Two Asian American actors get speaking roles and their lines are often hilarious Stephen Park as Judge Pete who is jovial for no good reason and Aaron Yoo as his son Heston who crosses that line from admiring muscly dudes to really admiring them. The roles are clearly written as Asian American roles. In fact father and son are identified specifically as Korean American highlighted by Judge Pete's wailing of ummah in a scene where the judge is not so jovial. Blitz does wonderful work in identifying the characters as Asian American while not announcing their scenes as The Asian Scenes. The jokes come but not at their expense. There's a funny line about the casserole they bring to dinner which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen the movie yet. The exchange says more about the mother aptly played by Lisbeth Bartlett and her appetite for the exotic than the Asianness of her guests.Later in the film the protagonist and Heston pair up in a speech competition and employing a technique suggested by his school counselor to quell the stammer Hal decides to affect an accent. The scene is brilliantly written directed and edited. The last time I was surprised by how loud I laughed in a movie was when Bart had a fullfrontal scene in The Simpsons. There's also a scene with that same counselor speaking from home to Hal on the phone. There is a shot that includes his significant other who is Asian. It's uncanny or is it uncannily canny. The casting she's a good looking woman and by most measures he did better than his station or his looks. The composition she is positioned in a way that suggests detachment and selfabsorption showing no interest in the conversation. She's in a bathrobe trimming her toenails or something similar on the couch displaying a level of comfort in particular with her body many Asians would find immodest and notsoclassy. A director with less skill would have had any Asian actress fiddling around in the background. Jeffrey Blitz creates something as precise as something Wes Anderson put on film without the elements becoming ornamental.Yes there are jokes in Rocket Science but it's not the jokegagjoke rabbit punches of Apatow and his bunch and none of that numbing repetitive dissonance of their adult language spoken by what we're supposed to believe are goofy high school kids. They write as if they are haunted by moments from their high school years in which they could have uttered something clever and snappy but the words came only after dinner. Another memorable scene in Rocket Science Hal visits the principal's office at a private school and while he waits there he discusses 2nd base with a girl that could be a delinquent. The girl's final remark is hilarious. And you believe it is something that could be said by a girl who was sent to the principal's office.".

	schema:reviewBody "Billed as 'Election' like and the first feature from the director of 'Spellbound' the documentary that followed American students through the harrowing spelling bee competitions 'Rocket Science' is quite frankly disappointing. It's not a bad film but it's also not that great. It so wants to be Rushmore Thumbsucker or anything by Wes Anderson and unfortunately its not and so falls quite flat. The story is basically about a guy with a stutter who wants to join the debating team problem number one he then falls for his debating partner who doesn't reciprocate and eventually defects to the other side problem number two. There are some funny moments and I don't like using the word but it is 'quirky'. Trouble is all the interesting characters are never explored the weird kid who lives opposite the untrained teacher who councils the strange goth girl etc have such fleeting screen time. The boy meets girl storyline is so old that if you are going to do it you really need to approach it in a fresh and exciting way this does neither and with the weak story underpinning it the film plods along to an inevitable conclusion. Where as films before have injected something anything into the visual makeup think 'Science of Sleep' or 'Eagle vrs Shark' this is filmed straight and uses natural light that renders some scenes so dark and dingy that it is at times almost unwatchable. Sometimes films where nothing happens works 'Old Joy' being a great example but here that nothingness doesn't translate into anything and although I wasn't bored it was dragging towards the end. Subject matter aside this had the potential to be something but sadly ended up another in a long line of pretenders to the throne. Roll on 'The Darjeeling Limited' to see hopefully how it's done.".

The boy is Hal Reece Thompson just annoying as hell in this. The girl is Ginny Anna Kendrick also pretty bad in this. Together they form an annoying stupid predictable relationship. The only mild laugh was from Jonah Hill as a student who sits next to Ben at the library. The movie is a mess from start to finish. It's another annoying extremely predictable teen comedy in which a no one gets to be a someone. There is no real plot the characters feel too forced and scripted and the jokes are just depressing. I can't really say I was disappointed by this film I knew nothing of it although I regularly do like D'Agosto. I feel like I should have never seen it. It's 98 minutes of my life I'll never get back. It's such an annoying film. The main problem with the film is that the film presents itself with a main character I just wanted to shut up. It's a movie of such tedium and annoyance that I have to say it's one of the worst film I've seen in a long long time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Along with DANTE'S INFERNO and THE MERRY WIDOW also made in 1934 I think this film is the reason the censorship Hays code was rigidly enforced in Hollywood for the next 30 years. Deleriously vulgar and immoral in every scene all set in a sensational nightclub for all ages and kinky tastes each leering winking and squabbling all set to foxtrots and waltzes reimagined by Busby Berkeley and climaxing with the most hilariously offensive musical number of all time Going To heaven On A Mule. There's no point explaining it or any other of the screwy dance numbers...including the leather clad SM themed whipping and murder tango by Inez and Harry...complete with loud cracks of the whip across the gorgeous face of the awesomely beautiful Delores Del Rio. Someone at Warners must have decided to create a shopping list of production possibilities directly from the planned Hays code of banned themes. It just does not stop being deliberately immoral vulgar and hilariously rude for all of its 88 minutes. I loved all 189 minutes of it because I kept re winding so many bits over and over just to gasp between laughs at the blatant unstoppable cheerfulness of it's violations. All in the most glamorous setting and style imaginable. The orchestral score is excellent  and I have an LP from the 70s with GO INTO YOUR DANCE on the other side. It is created directly from the soundtrack so there is plenty of dialog as well. WONDERBAR is CABARET 1934 for real. Wait 'till you see the epic musical sequence called Don't Say Goodnight where a squadron of negligee clad showgirls dance around massive moving 'pillars' that have big veiny patterns weaving down from the top. That is in between floating past the camera lit from behind so we can see how sheer their garments are. The scene where two turkey like old dames ditch their husbands and together pick up the one gigolo planning a threesome is a screamer...he clinches the job with the incestuous note You remind me of my mother to which they very happily go for him.... and this is all just starters! On top of all this is Al Jolson leering and bellowing all lustful and creepy... not too much a stretch for Joel Grey in 1972 singing Wilkommen and getting an Oscar! Find WONDERBAR and show it to everyone you know! Colossal and bent as all hell... to music. Read the other comments on this site for the story and viewer outrage. Haha!".

	schema:reviewBody "WONDER BAR First National 1934 directed by Lloyd Bacon is a perfect example of a precode movie that dares to be daring and surprisingly different. It's one of the most elaborate musicals to star Al Jolson with choreography by the Million Dollar Dance Director Busby Berkeley. Jolson in his first Warner Brothers musical after a four year absence fits his role to perfection as Al Wonder entertainer and proprietor of The Wonder Bar night club in Paris. In a plot set in a single evening as does Universal's forgotten 1932 drama NIGHT WORLD starring Lew Ayres and Mae Clarke with Boris Karloff as the night club proprietor which featured one brief Busby Berkeley production number Al loves the star dancer Ynez Dolores Del Rio who loves her partner Harry Ricardo Cortez but he is carrying on an affair with a businessman's wife Liane Kay Francis etc. Also in the cast are Dick Powell Tommy the bandleader and singer who also loves Ynez Robert Barrat as the suicidal Russian Hugh Herbert and Guy Kibbee as married drunk American businessmen who flirt with a couple of gold diggers Merna Kennedy and Fifi Dorsay while their wives Ruth Donnelly and Louise Fazenda try to make a play with a young Frenchman. Interesting that this movie includes so much plot and subplot in its tight 86 minutes that director Lloyd Bacon succeeds in keeping the story moving in between songs. WONDER BAR features some very risqu dialog and scenes that would have kept this movie from being released had it been distributed to theaters after the Production Code enforcement in May 1934. Maybe that's why WONDER BAR played sporadically on local television back in the 1960s and disappeared before the end of the decade making it as underplayed as the excellent backstager 42nd STREET Warners 1933 was overplayed. Good tunes by Harry Warren and Al Dubin include Vive La France Why Do I Dream Those Dreams? and the instrumental tango dance titled Tango Del Rio. One of the highlights include the production number Don't Say Goodnight sung by Powell featuring dancers with overhead angles which is so mesmerizing to see and tuneful to hear even at ten minutes. But while the 12 minute Jolson finale Goin' to Heaven on a Mule might offend today's viewers it is quite a production number just the same inspired by Marc Connelly's The Green Pastures which needs to be seen to be believed. Participating in this number is Hal LeRoy in a brief tapdance sequence. While Al Jolson is hailed as a great singer but poor actor which is evident in some of his earlier film roles notably SAY IT WITH SONGS WB 1929 I feel his acting has improved with this one and the subsequent roles that were to follow and he looks more at ease making wisecracks and singing to an audience than giving tearful performances especially in blackface. His argumentative scene with Ricardo Cortez in which they play rivals who hate each other looks so real that maybe they actually hated each other offscreen. When Cortez as Harry puffs cigarette smoke in Al's eyes it appears as if Al really wanted to sock him. One wonders how WONDER BAR was behind the scenes amongst the other cast members.WONDER BAR is available for viewing on Turner Classic Movies and video cassette. A record soundtrack to this double featured with songs from GO INTO YOUR DANCE from the late 1970s would be an interesting find today. ".

	schema:headline " Odd Mix Of Vulgarity  Romance";
	schema:reviewBody "Welcome to the WONDER BAR! Your host Al Wonder Al Jolson promises you the finest music  entertainment Paris can offer in this wonderful year of 1934. Our featured dancers Harry  Inez Ricardo Cortez  Dolores Del Rio will thrill you with their passion they say that Inez adores Harry but that he a true gigolo loves only money. Seated on the sidelines is a wealthy married woman Kay Francis who is supposedly giving Harry diamonds for his affections. Al loves Inez as does his boy bandleader  crooner Tommy Dick Powell. And if you glance over at the bar you'll see a French Captain Robert Barrat bankrupt disposing of his last cash  valuables hinting darkly that we should not miss tomorrow morning's newspapers. Al himself will of course entertain us with a selection of tunes sung in his inimitable style. Yes I think we can promise you an evening you won't forget full of waltzes  romance love  hate murder  suicide! Right this way mesdames  messieurs!Released just prior to the imposition of the Production Code this neglected film is an example of too much talent  not enough taste. Sex in several illicit forms seems to preoccupy much of the dialogue  plot watch the reaction on Jolie's face as the two young men dance past him. Some of the references are a bit sly others obscure but the decadence lingers on...That having been said the film does have strengths. Jolson is wonderful to watch. His outsized personality was too big for any screen to hold nonetheless his talent to entertain was immense  he doesn't stint here. Francis she has little to do  Del Rio are both lovely and Powell is in good voice. The comedy is handled by two American couples Guy Kibbee  Ruth Donnelley and Hugh Herbert  Louise Fazenda who bicker and flirt and have almost nothing to do with the rest of the plot.Al Dubin  Harry Warren provided some good tunes for the picture.

	onyx:emotionText "Welcome to the WONDER BAR! Your host Al Wonder Al Jolson promises you the finest music  entertainment Paris can offer in this wonderful year of 1934. Our featured dancers Harry  Inez Ricardo Cortez  Dolores Del Rio will thrill you with their passion they say that Inez adores Harry but that he a true gigolo loves only money. Seated on the sidelines is a wealthy married woman Kay Francis who is supposedly giving Harry diamonds for his affections. Al loves Inez as does his boy bandleader  crooner Tommy Dick Powell. And if you glance over at the bar you'll see a French Captain Robert Barrat bankrupt disposing of his last cash  valuables hinting darkly that we should not miss tomorrow morning's newspapers. Al himself will of course entertain us with a selection of tunes sung in his inimitable style. Yes I think we can promise you an evening you won't forget full of waltzes  romance love  hate murder  suicide! Right this way mesdames  messieurs!Released just prior to the imposition of the Production Code this neglected film is an example of too much talent  not enough taste. Sex in several illicit forms seems to preoccupy much of the dialogue  plot watch the reaction on Jolie's face as the two young men dance past him. Some of the references are a bit sly others obscure but the decadence lingers on...That having been said the film does have strengths. Jolson is wonderful to watch. His outsized personality was too big for any screen to hold nonetheless his talent to entertain was immense  he doesn't stint here. Francis she has little to do  Del Rio are both lovely and Powell is in good voice. The comedy is handled by two American couples Guy Kibbee  Ruth Donnelley and Hugh Herbert  Louise Fazenda who bicker and flirt and have almost nothing to do with the rest of the plot.Al Dubin  Harry Warren provided some good tunes for the picture. Powell sings 'Why Do I Dream Those Dreams?'  'Wonder Bar'  while Jolson sinks his teeth into 'Welcome To My Wonder BarVive La France.' Busby Berkeley was the dance choreographer and he provides one of his finest creations 'Don't Say GoodNight' featuring the talents of Powell Del Rio  Cortez with the Berkeley hallmark identical blonde chorus girls in swirling precision movements filmed from above this time endlessly magnified by mirrors.

While this is not a great movie by any means it is still a lot of fun and it is more innuendo than actual open sinning going on.Al Jolson is the headliner at the Wonder Bar in Paris a nightclub where the elite go to toss down a few martinis escape from their nagging wife or forget that they are married to an older businessman who spends more time in the office than trying to have fun. Dolores Del Rio and Ricardo Cortez are the dancing team who are having a bit too intense of a time He Wips Her But She Likes It! is one of the dances they do as he is involved with other women most seriously bored wife Kay Francis. She is the one with the busy businessman husband and she is very wary of the working relationship between Cortez and Del Rio.Also involved are the comic relief older couples of Ruth Donnelly and Guy Kibbee and Louise Fazenda and Hugh Herbert. The men want to spend an evening with some pretty French girls while the two women flirt with two sleazy gigolos. They spend the evening trying to get rid of the other which results in some comical double entendres. Fifi D'Orsay is one of the French working girls which must have inspired Stephen Sondheim to cast her 36 years later in Follies on Broadway to sing Ah Paris!.After Jolson gets things started with the title tune we are treated to some glorious production numbers. The classy Don't Say Goodnight just seems to go on forever spacewise not lengthwise with its use of mirrors on three sides of the stage and is truly a romantic moment. Much more controversial other than the sudden dance with two men the one cutting in pushing the woman out of the way is the Goin' to Heaven on a Mule which utilizes every black stereotype there is. A huge white heaven with a smaller black heaven next door segregated you know... and a heavenly nightclub set on Heaven's own Lennox Avenue. Then a blackfaced Hal LeRoy tap dances out of a giant watermelon while Jolson you expect him in blackface feasts on a chicken roasted for him in which you see the poor bird plucked by a machine  skewered onto a roaster. Utilized in the documentary It Came From Hollywood as an example of Hollywood's bad taste in making some musicals it has survived its controversy and not been exorcised out of prints. Most audiences simply look at it as an artistic triumph in spite of its bad taste that has taught us lessons and is an example of where Hollywood used to be and has moved far away from. Still it is lighthearted compared to the same year's Pickin' Cotton from George White's Scandals in which a huge mammy character raises her skirt so a dozen or so blackfaced children can run out from underneath it!When Jolson is in front of an audience singing there is a joy exhilarating from him like the shining of a star. He isn't so comfortable in the serious acting sequences. Kay Francis obviously upset by being secondary to Del Rio suffers as a result of her unhappiness with the role although the bitterness she feels somehow matches that of the character. What makes it worse is that Francis and Del Rio sometimes appear to have similar looks with the widows peak hairstyle but Del Rio is much more exotic looking. Dick Powell is on only to sing a few songs and adds only incidental plot development. Cortez once again plays a sleazy character much like the same year's Mandaly which costarred Francis in a much better part who is not so likable. The four older character actors offer much needed humor to the somber plot which includes a murder a suicide and eventually cover up. As Jolson would say it's all in a night's work.".

Wonder Bar seems to me to be one of the few Berkeley movies like Gold Diggers of 1933 and Footlight Parade whose plot is genuinely interesting and entertaining in itself and not just an excuse to set up the spectacular numbers. The alternation between drama and comedy which bothers some of the other reviewers is one of the best things about this film it gives it a contemporary quality even if some of the numbers badly date it. Lloyd Bacon's direction is unusually stylish for this generally hacky filmmaker the Harry WarrenAl Dubin songs are at least serviceable and sometimes better than that and though Warners was dubious enough about Al Jolson's continued popularity that they surrounded him with an allstar cast Dick Powell Kay Francis Dolores del Rio Ricardo Cortez he triumphs.One thing I've always loved about Jolson is that  unlike Eddie Cantor and other contemporaries who sang in blackface exactly the way they sang in whiteface viz. the CantorBerkeley Whoopee!  Jolson didn't. In his whiteface number in Wonder Bar Vive la France Jolson's voice is a shrill high tenor with an annoyingly fast vibrato. His singing on Mule is in an almost different style he drops his register slows down his vibrato sings from deeper in his chest and genuinely tries for  and I think achieves  the simple direct eloquence of the Black singers of the time. Whatever you think of Jolson's blackface act and I'll admit it dates VERY badly blackface liberated Jolson and freed him to sing in a deeper more soulful style. One could make the case that Jolson did for Black music what Benny Goodman and Elvis Presley did later  as a white performer he could reach audiences Blacks themselves couldn't  and Jolson actually did it twice in the 1910's when he got his start on Broadway and the 1940's when the success of The Jolson Story launched his comeback. White audiences tired of the bland crooners of the early 1940's seized on Jolson's direct ballsy style and his comeback paved the way for other Blackinfluenced white singers like Frankie Laine Johnnie Ray and Elvis.Also if you'll dig out your copy of the O Brother Where Art Thou? soundtrack CD and listen to the 1928 recording of Big Rock Candy Mountain by Harry McClintock and you'll find that the fantasy of heaven in the Mule number isn't all that different from the one in this song where the hens lay softboiled eggs ... and they hung the jerk who invented work by a whiteface performer aimed at a white audience. O.K. so no one would dare do a number like this today but Mule is still astonishing and despite the patronization worthy to stand as the one JolsonBerkeley collaboration.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Wonder Bar' stars Al Jolson in a film with more plot than usual and it's one of his best efforts. Jolson's films are notoriously tainted by racist blackface routines in 'Wonder Bar' this material is completely avoided until the very end of the film when we get a long blackface number called Goin' to Heaven on a Mule. If you fastforward through this to get to the last few minutes of the film tying up some loose ends in the plot you'll be better off.Several Warner Brothers movies of this period 'Two Seconds' 'Central Park' featured a 'bookends' structure in which the film's opening shot and closing shot are the same camera setup. We get a variation on that structure here. The first couple of reels of 'Wonder Bar' set up the conflicts between the characters. Then about a third of the way into the film we get the first 'bookend' as Jolson's nightclub the Wonder Bar opens for the evening a liveried doorman unrolls a red carpet and salutes us. At the very end of the film after the Wonder Bar has closed for the night the doorman rolls up the carpet and salutes us again.I'm a longtime fan of Dolores del Rio an immensely talented actress who was also exceedingly sexy. Here she gives the best and sexiest performance I've ever seen from her as a cabaret dancer who is bullied and exploited by her dance partner the very hissable Ricardo Cortez. Jolson is in love with del Rio this is cleverly depicted with an unusual visual device but she doesn't return his love.Dick Powell is less annoying and less obtrusive than usual. Ditto the raccooneyed Kay Francis whom I always dislike. SPOILERS COMING. There's an amusing subplot with four Warners stalwarts Guy Kibbee Hugh Herbert Louise Fazenda and the splendid Ruth Donnelly as two stodgy married couples on holiday. The husbands conspire to sneak out for a night on the tiles while the wives are asleep the wives plot to sneak out while the husbands are asleep. Unfortunately after setting up this very funny situation there's no payoff for it.Veteran character actor Robert Barrat plays a role well outside his usual range with only partial success. Somewhat implausibly Jolson allows Barrat to commit suicide because this will help Jolson conceal a murder committed by del Rio. We're meant to admire Jolson for this.I shan't comment on the protracted blackface routine late in the film except to say that it's a dull number apart from its offensiveness. The effeminate tapdancer Hal LeRoy performs nearly naked in blackface and full body makeup. Instead of painting a white man to look like a black man couldn't Warners have hired a black tapdancer instead? Plenty of black men were much better dancers than Hal LeRoy.Much earlier in the film there's one very surprising gag involving Jolson and two gay men. During his long career as a stage performer Jolson frequently worked 'lavender' material into his act. Like the British comedian Max Miller Jolson was a heterosexual performer who deliberately led audiences to suspect he might be homosexual. Apparently the rumours were good for the box office. Jolson employed 'camp' humour and gay jokes frequently onstage but so far as I know 'Wonder Bar' is the only time he ever did this in a film. I'll rate 'Wonder Bar' 8 points out of 10. I was tempted to knock off several points for the blackface routine but I put them back on again for Dolores del Rio's very erotic performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "...and a great film comeback vehicle for Al Jolson. This film was released on March 31 1934 just three months before the production code began to be enforced. As such it is a buffet of items one would never see on film again in the U.S. until the 1960's  adultery as comedy gigolos a pair of men dancing with Jolson making the remark Boys will be Boys a dancing act involving a woman being whipped what amounts to housesponsored prostitution to keep the Wonder Bar's male patrons amused a suicide that everyone knows about in advance and nobody bothers to stop and a murder that goes unpunished and even undetected for that matter. However this film is much more than just a last hurrah for the precode years and I found it quite enjoyable. It is an intersection of Grand Hotel the world's greatest entertainer Al Jolson and that genius of choreography Busby Berkeley with plenty of action and snappy dialogue to keep things going.Of course it is very ironic that the one part of the film that leaves everyone shocked today is probably one of the few things that the Hays Office had no problem with  that wellknown musical number Going to Heaven on a Mule. It is exactly what you would expect when the overthetop style of Busby Berkeley's choreography meets the minstrel tradition of Al Jolson's musical style. Every racial stereotype in the book is in this musical number and it was omitted on the VHS release of this film but was kept in the laser disc Jolson set. That's probably because laser disc was seen as specialty product whereas the VHS release was seen as something for consumption by the masses. The Warner Archives is also seen as a niche market so the number is included in that DVDR release. I am glad of that because the present will never be made better by trying to erase or adjust the past no matter how uncomfortable it may make people feel.Highly recommended as great classic movie fun if you can just remember that this film was made in 1934 not last week.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1931 Al Jolson went back to Broadway to star in a new show Wonder Bar. It got good reviews but as it was the middle of the Great Depression the costs proved too much and it closed after two months.Not like any great hit songs came out of it for Jolson but Warner Brothers decided to buy it for him as a film property. The plot line was changed somewhat and a whole new score was written for the film by Warner Brothers contract composers Harry Warren and Al Dubin.Jolson got as one of his costars Dick Powell who was the screen partner of Mrs. Jolson Ruby Keeler. Although Powell was fifth in the billing he was number one in the song department. His songs included Don't Say Goodnight Why Do I Dream Those Dreams and the title song. Powell plays the orchestra leader at the Wonder Bar and helps Jolson in the vocal department.Between Jolson and Powell in the billing are Dolores Del Rio Ricardo Cortez and Kay Francis. Del Rio and Cortez are a pair of tango dancers and both Powell and Jolson are crushing on her. She is hopelessly infatuated with Cortez. And Kay Francis is a rich woman who Cortez has been seeing on the side.Ricardo Cortez was one of a number Rudolph Valentino wannabes during the silent screen era and in Wonder Bar he's as nasty a heel as ever been portrayed on the screen. Wonder Bar was produced right before the Code took effect and there are lots of sexual innuendo in this film. Of course it's set in Paris and one expects decadence there. But apart from a few newsreel shots to establish Paris as the location this was all done on the Warner back lot. Jolson got three songs of his own Vive La France Otchichornya and the infamous Heaven on a Mule. It's as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Al Jolson got his start at the turn of the 20th century in live minstrel shows which were still around then as a runaway kid. When he became a star on Broadway he played black characters on stage in blackface. And for reasons that I still can't fathom would not leave it behind. I'm sure that in his mind Jolson felt this was what the audience expected from him.It's worse because Heaven on a Mule adds zero to the plot. In a Parisian nightclub I'm sure the audience was not expecting a blackface number. Remember this was the Paris that Josephine Baker was triumphing in at that point in time. It might have been nice had Ms. Baker or Ethel Waters had done a real number Wonder Bar would have a better historic reputation today.".

But there is yet another thing which I wasn't particularly fond of in this film which was Dick Powell who I think is overrated. If you don't like minstrels then don't see this film it has Al Jolson in it. Despite being a great lover of music I am not terribly fond of some of Busby Berkely's stuff His dance sequences for example tend to be a bit overlong.

Al Jolson based on a number of biographies started wearing blackface after his first few nervous performances.

	schema:reviewBody "The hot spot in Paris is the Wonder Bar. For entertainment dancing good food and what tickles your fancy this is the place. Wonder Bar is a very provocative and titillating little film with a very good and talented cast. Though some may say she's wasted in this film considering she's been in more melodramatic films where's suffering and loving and decked out in lavish gowns Kay Francis is the female lead. She has been unfaithful to her husband Henry Kolker with a dance instructor and entertainer played by Ricardo Cortez. When detectives have confronted her husband about the affair she doesn't make that day's rendezvous and hightails it to the Wonder Bar where Ricardo will be later. It seems she gave him a necklace she needs back for insurance purposes and to keep the proof of her infidelity from her husband. The Wonder Bar is owned by Al Jolson who also sings for the guests. He of course delivers with usual pizazz. But the main attraction is Ricardo and his partner Dolores Del Rio who of course loves him. But Dick Powell loves her too. Added to the mix are patrons of the restaurant Guy Kibbee and wife Louise Fazenda and friend Hugh Herbert and wife Ruth Ronnelly who came for the eats but did they? Right away Guy and Hugh are flirting with pretty young things and even a pretty boy is touching and flirting with Louise Fazenda. She in turn says her room number very loudly. Shocking!? A guy asks to cut in on the dance floor and he proceeds to dance with the man. The KayRicardoDolores triangle comes to a head very dramatically with a memorable dance number with a whip. A whip! For a minor little film this was very entertaining and had just enough bizarre naughtiness to differentiate itself from other precode films. The only criticism is the black musical number which goes on too long and does seem to be a bit overthetop and hard to take. Getting back to the action the married men Hugh and Guy tells the p.y.t.s they'll see them later after they ditch the wives and Louise has a rendezvous of her own. What happens next? We'll never know because this is about the Wonder Bar where things only get started.".

Cortez is a nasty character and the dance partner at the title establishment of Dolores Del Rio.Ms. Del Rio one of the great beauties of movie history is not served well by the makeup and hairstyling here. She looks like the Ann Miller of 2000. Francis is as chic as ever and has a thankfully small role  almost a cameo.Louise Fazenda as the wife in two American couples visiting France is hilarious doing everything she can to attract the boys. Not presumably the two whom we see dancing together. The dance number between Cortez and Del Rio is genuinely shocking. It's called a whip dance and he cracks a whip like a lion tamer. It doesn't touch her but she crawls on the floor responding to it. This movie has some of the raciest scenes of any between the end of the Code and Lina Wertmuller.Alas a scene near the end begins with Jolson in blackface and expands to include a whole group of supporting singers in blackface. This was a convention and one of specialties. I have seen it in movies made as recently as Torch Song from the early 1950s in which a blond Joan Crawford sings in blackface.

The story of a night at Al Wonder's Al Jolson Paris nightclub named after the film is full of dark humor crazy cougars love triangles and crimes of passion. Sadly it's quite forgettable and these parts of the movie aren't really why anybody would watch Wonder Bar today.The two reasons to view Wonder Bar is first to see Al Jolson sing and he puts on a terrific show. My favorite part is when he talks to the Russian Count and he goes back to his roots Jolson was born in present day Lithuania and develops a Russian accent. Yes he's playing himself but that's good enough for everybody.The second are the two Busby Berkeley numbers. Don't Say Goodnight is an amazing showcase of his choreography skills with tons of blondes and mesmerizing visuals.Going' To Heaven On A Mule over the years has aged worse and worse. Every time I think of all those kids in blackface I cringe. I find it hard to believe the producers would think Going' To Heaven On A Mule would be listed among the greatest movie musical numbers ever. The idea of hundreds of whites dancing in blackface with Jolson still disturbs me. Maybe Hays was right in this case that having a Code would at least prevent this kind of overt racist humor for a period of time. You would figure back in 1934 Hollywood was liberal enough to discard the watermelon stereotype but apparently not.Wonder Bar is nothing special outside of Jolson and the two big Berkeley numbers. It's definitely a mustwatch for serious cinephiles but that's about it.".

Sadly it's quite forgettable and these parts of the movie aren't really why anybody would watch Wonder Bar today.The two reasons to view Wonder Bar is first to see Al Jolson sing and he puts on a terrific show. My favorite part is when he talks to the Russian Count and he goes back to his roots Jolson was born in present day Lithuania and develops a Russian accent. Yes he's playing himself but that's good enough for everybody.The second are the two Busby Berkeley numbers. Don't Say Goodnight is an amazing showcase of his choreography skills with tons of blondes and mesmerizing visuals.Going' To Heaven On A Mule over the years has aged worse and worse. Every time I think of all those kids in blackface I cringe. I find it hard to believe the producers would think Going' To Heaven On A Mule would be listed among the greatest movie musical numbers ever. The idea of hundreds of whites dancing in blackface with Jolson still disturbs me. Maybe Hays was right in this case that having a Code would at least prevent this kind of overt racist humor for a period of time. You would figure back in 1934 Hollywood was liberal enough to discard the watermelon stereotype but apparently not.Wonder Bar is nothing special outside of Jolson and the two big Berkeley numbers. It's definitely a mustwatch for serious cinephiles but that's about it.";

The story is essentially a remix of 'The Prisoner of Zenda' with the addition of a historical background the 1848 Revolutions and Otto Bismarck's attempts to unify Germany. The genius of the Flashman protagonist this is adapted from a terrific series of books is that in public he is a war hero but in private he is a lecherous coward. Cue instant entertainment with a uniquely reluctant hero as he is dragged into the dangerous plot. Fans of the novels have quite rightly complained that Malcolm McDowell isn't dark or beefy enough for the character  but it doesn't much matter as he turns in a terrific performance anyway. The film is full of good actors David Jason Bob Hoskins Oliver Reed who are uniformly excellent with even Britt Ekland doing a standup job. This ability extends to every other part of the production. The locations and costume are stunning and unusual  Victorian Mitteleurope looking beautiful and strangely exotic to this Englishman. The key however is the plot which is stuffed with intrigue loveaffairs pursuits assassinations humour and darn good characters. Also look out for much periodauthentic slang and all sorts of odd historically accurate details. The 1970s was also a perfect time for such a film with social rebellion breaking down the stuffiness of many prior historical films yet without the stultifying political correctness present in so many modern historical films. It zips along with pace making best use of the historical background to magnify the drama zipwiring down a telegraph line until it's thoroughly satisfying conclusion.Worth two or more viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman series I have seen this film many times and it's a treat to finally own a widescreen transfer on DVD. Royal Flash is the 1975 film based on the second Flashman novel of the same name. It stars Malcolm McDowell as Captain Harry Flashman Oliver Reed as future German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck Alan Bates as Rudi von Sternberg Britt Ekland as the chilly Princess Irma and Florinda Bolkan plays the actressmistress of mad Bavarian King Ludwig. Lola Montez. It also features the best Scrooge ever Alastair Sim and a preRoger Rabbit Bob Hoskins in minor but memorable parts. Fraser wrote the screenplay and the film was directed by Richard Lester. It is very similar in style to their collaboration on The ThreeFour Musketeers films of 19731974 which also featured great locales swordfighting galore and an ideal cast. OK first the BAD news although I saw a 1975 preview screening in Ottawa I have never seen the original longer version which apparently was released and trimmed to 102 minutes shortly after. Sadly this footage which apparently featured Lester regular actor Roy Kinnear in some scenes does NOT appear on the DVD. There are some special features including the theatrical trailer and a couple of minidocumentaries made around 2004. Another quibble some Flashy purists have expressed is that McDowell is not stout enough to play Harry. I think the natural devilment in Malcolm's performance more than makes up for his stature and they even try to make him broadchested in the film. I'm a Flashy purist too and I prefer the tall lancer figure portrayed by Barbosa on the original book covers to the rather fat portraits on the current book covers. Finally some have objected to the slapstick nature of the film and perhaps these readers are more interested in Flashy's military campaigns than his rollicking amorous adventures. How much you like Lester's use of muttered quips and style of shooting will perhaps guide you if you like A Hard Day's Night Help! or the Musketeers films you should enjoy this one. If you're looking for Kubrick move along. Here's the GOOD news the widescreen transfer is fine the outdoor location shots still gorgeous and the movie is great fun. It is still a puzzle to me why such a fine film stiffed at the box office and was hard to find on TV or video for so many years. But you don't even have to be a fan of the books to enjoy this movie or know the fascinating actual histories of Bismarck or Lola Montes to enjoy the largerthanlife characters. P.S. any resemblance to the classic Prisoner of Zenda is entirely deliberate. Eight out of ten stars only because I hope the lost footage has survived and may be available in a BluRay please! version soon.".

	schema:headline " A Huge Disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "As an avid fan of the Flashman books by George McDonald Fraser I looked forward immensely to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this film was first released. Sadly it was a huge disappointment then  so I left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again but it was no better the second time. Mr Fraser is a tremendously skillful writer but I am not a fan of his film screenplay work with Richard Lester. The penchant for slapstick spoilt 'The Three Musketeers' for me and the same applies here. To me the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong. The Flashman books are uproariously funny in parts but they are adventure novels. There is much seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has  after all he is involved in dangerous situations. This is conveyed in the novels but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style. It is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I first read that the book was to be filmed the article said that the film was to star Oliver Reed. I rejoiced as Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman. How I would have loved to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by the books too scrawny looking! Flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow. Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the film is that it is made as a comedy. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet Tom Bell. A great shame as the production values costumes sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent  just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from Malcolm McDowell. Possibly the directorship of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is as a recent radio adaptation of 'Flash For Freedom' adapted by Mr Fraser worked quite well. Perhaps one day we may see Flashman done justice on screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Lester's rollicking comedic followup to his two Musketeers movies this is not quite up there but still doesn't explain why this is almost an unknown film or worse an almost lost film. McDowell captures much of the spirit of the notorious lecherous Capt.Flashman of the books by G.MacDonald Fraser a devout coward when pressed but possessed of so much British insolence and bluff he gets by quite well. The film lacks much of any other interesting truly humorous characters but Oliver Reed is a hoot as the humorless Otto von Bismarck planning to begin a new Reich in Europe with Flashman as one of his pawns this is the mid 19th century by the way. He and Flashman begin a contentious relationship near the beginning with Flashman usually taunting him and Otto swearing a retribution. Those are some of the best scenes including Otto's boxing challenge with reallife boxer Cooper.Alan Bates on the other hand never quite warms to the part as the suave adventurer Rudi a more polished version of Flashman always dressed in white and quite dashing. He pops up almost a half hour into the film and maybe is too suave his scenes lack a certain something such as the droll atmosphere pervading everything else. Overall it's an impressive cast including wellknown Brits Tom Bell and Lionel Jeffries hamming it up as Otto's henchmen. But like Bates they're not given a chance to really shine usually relegated to an odd mixture of slapstick and serious threats against Flashman's life. A thinner than we're used to seeing Bob Hoskins shows up briefly near the beginning as a copper. Britt Ekland as a duchess also seems to make only a token appearance. McDowell however even gets a chance to play a second role that of Flashman's double a more noble prince. The first half of this picture is really promising delivering period entertainment it doesn't quite live up to its promise later but it's still a royal good time. It's a shame this film is best available only as a DVDR if one can find it. Update new DVD arrived in April 2007!".

Unfortunately they picked the weakest of the Flashman books. To be fair it's a very enjoyable read but compared to the others it comes out not quite up to standard. I guess they picked it because it could be made within a certain budget. No large battle scenes and it could be made in European locations. One can always debate whether MacDowell was the right choice. He certainly lacked the stature but on the other hand he did project that natural insolence one would expect from Flashy.

	schema:reviewBody "George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman Papers are ripe for movie treatment but unfortunately the only film available is Dick Lester's Royal Flash.On paper the idea of Lester directing a Fraser script sounds promising.

	schema:reviewBody "Tricia Helfer sparkles nicely in this Bizarro World comedy directed by Robert Cuffley. In some ways it hearkens back to the mid1930s and to some of the great screwball comedies of that era except with a much harder and daring edge to it. She's an old friend of the bungling ingnue from a hick town  Lee Lee Sobieski  who has made a niche for herself in the big bad city by becoming a pro dominatrix.For those who don't know being a dominatrix is a lifestyle choice with psychological and sexual overtones but rarely involving actual sex. It is about psychosexual mind games and roleplaying with its own rules and subculture. In all of that Helfer's characterization and charm seems to be admirably suited for the choice of Celine.Sobieski takes a brilliant turn as the goofy young friend who simply cannot keep out of her own way. There is in all of this comedic action a dark undercurrent of criminal behavior as Sobieski's character  ironically named Alberta  blunders her way into and out of real trouble where there's real violence done to the real people in her life. She's like a lightning rod in that regard.The genius of the film lies in how the director and these two superb actresses move the story forward almost effortlessly as every time Alberta stumbles into a predicament whatever she does next fails to resolve the problem. It only brings a worse and yet even funnier predicament.The DVD presentation is terrific and there's just enough of Sobieski's beautiful body shown  for the right reasons  to warrant this film having a most sensible R rating. There's just too much sexual role playing in the plot for young teens and it is not something in the way of entertainment for preteen youngsters at all period.Aside from that caveat this is one goofy wacky welldone comedy.The criminal behavior involved in the plot is diluted somewhat by the hapless nature of the three criminal characters. They are bad hombres for sure but just so darned incompetent that they don't really frighten anyone all that much ... adults that is. They are not misunderstood it should be noted these characters  but they are comically incoherent and impulsive.So this film ought to and does get seven stars out of ten with two additional boxes of popcorn tossed in for good measure.".

I didn't see this in a cinema but if I did I would think twice about asking for my money back. I am very open minded about movies as I watch a lot of them every single week but this definitely was not a good movie.

In this show however talent is wasted ability is squandered and the audience is assumed to be sick in bed with the flu. I would compare this film to Bon Cop Bad Cop another Canadian production that took actors with chops and turned them into chopped liver.Put another way I think if you laughed uproariously at the humour in Bon Cop Bad Cop and you never figured out that Harry Buttman in that film was a parody of a real person then you will love Walk All Over Me. I didn't think Bon Cop Bad Cop was funny at all nor entertaining but it was Heat combined with Ghostbusters compared to this turkey.Screwball comedies work because the humour arises from the peculiar logic of the situation.

Made in the sweltering heat of the northern Sahara Desert of Libya I found myself sitting up until 2 am to see it through to the end enjoying every minute of it feeling like I was experiencing every task of the events in the story along with the characters.The story tells of ambulance corps officer played by John Mills named Captain Anson whom the war has driven to drink who is unwillingly ordered to leave besieged Tobruk before the Germans break through and take the strategically important town over. In his ambulance he takes with him two young nurses along with the stalwart Sergeant Major Tom Pugh played by Harry Andrews and heads out across the desert for Alexandria in Egypt. Their journey leads them through many obstacles and along the way they pick up the enigmatic South African army officer Captain van der Poel vanderPOOel he corrects them in his distinctly Afrikaner accent played by Anthony Quayle who has become detached from his unit and is looking for a lift. Can they beat the elements of the desert and make it to Alexandria where Anson knows of a certain bar that serves the ice cold lager he so longs for and promises the others? In height and build Mills is a much smaller next to big men like Andrews and Quayle but I was very impressed with how his strong acting and personal inner character make him seem as tall and broad shouldered as the other two. I also admired how the whole cast put their all into the many no doubt very difficult scenes obviously having to deal with the physically exhaustive work that was asked of them the tortuous heat and sand fleas nipping at their legs. I could see they were feeling the affects and that adds to the realism of the whole film. Note even the lovely Sylvia Syms as the seemingly unshakable nurse Sister Diana Murdoch didn't avoid having to look hot sweaty and bothered like her male costars unlike some Hollywood actresses of that time who I will not even mention. That and the ambulance must have been an oven during the whole shoot.! A truly unique film and worth the whole gripping two hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen Ice Cold In Alex three or four times over thirty years. Each  time I find it more impressive.  At one level of course it's a classic adventure story four people  pitched against an amazing hostile environment one of whom is  evidently not who he appears to be. Incident by incident and the pace  of the film never flags the tension builds and our view of the  characters deepens.  But what struck me most last time I viewed it was how untypical a 50s  war film it is. Most films of that era have an uncomplicated patriotic  message  in this case they would usually concentrate on the adventure  itself and the unmasking of the spy as the main points of the story.  ICIA is quite different. It is ambiguous not simplistic in its  political values. The British characters act in a way which is  practically treasonable themselves  they hide the fact that Quayle is  a spy from the authorities. Of course the shock element of the ending  is that you don't expect them to do this until the actual moment in the  bar in Alex when they confront Quayle. But in retrospect you can see  how early in the film the Mills character prepares the ground  the  critical moment is when he throws away Quayle's jacket after saving him  from the quicksand.  The nearest the film gets to patriotism is presenting tolerance and  loyalty as quintessentially British values.  Mills as the alcoholic antihero is particularly good. I love that line  It's a personal thing.. Sylvia Sims is also good as the woman who  sees the admirable qualities of Mills beneath the lush and knows what  she wants.  The very end of the film also seems to me to buck convention. We might  expect to return to the British characters after Quayle is taken away  as a POW not a spy to witness an emotional parting. Instead we see  events from Quayle's eyes looking out from the back of the lorry that  takes him off through the streets of Alexandria. What happens to the  Brits is left to our imagination.".

When the subject of war movies comes up I always tell people this is my favourite war movie and in my opinion one of the best  and usually get a blank look. They recognize the cast when I list them though. And it is a great cast  Mills Andrews Quayle. And I am totally in love with Sylvia Sims in this. I guess I must have a thing for beautiful women with no makeup sweating in khakis. I loved Juliette Binoche in Canadian battledress in The English Patient too  but I digress.This is simply good storytelling and great character drama in a setting that tests character with an authentic look and feel and superb BW photography of the kind that distinguished so many postwar 'neorealist' films. There are so many great moments such as van der Poel lifting the ambulance the 'surprise' encounter with the SAS ? man the Blimpish officer's encounter with an 88mm shell in his Humber staff car Mill's moments of crisis stunning closeups of Sylvia Sims and and especially that moment in the bar which makes you want to run out for a tall frosty one. Next time I view it I will indeed have a cold Carlsberg waiting in the fridge. Years ago I was sailing across Lake Winnipeg to Gimli on a slow hot July day with little wind  I promised we would enjoy beer and pizza when we finally made it to harbour and I was thinking of this movie.I am also a bit of a military vehicle buff and I like this movie for that too  for me the ambulance  I think it's an MorrisCommecial CS1130F or maybe a Ford WOT2 but I'd have to see the movie again to be sure  is also one of the stars. Crankingupthesanddune is probably my favourite scene with it. The Wages of Fear Scorcerer comes to mind as a comparable vehicleascharacter movie.Vehicle buffs will also enjoy the anachronism of seeing a Land Rover parked on the street in the background of the final shot  the car wasn't in production until 1947.".

John Mills is a captain with a drinking problem and he's in charge of a party of four driving an ambulance out which consists of RSM Harry Andrews and British nurses Sylvia Sims and Diane Clare.

The main characters are an army captain on the verge of a breakdown a determined nurse a solid sergeant major and a South African soldier whom they pick up on the way. With simple heroism they try making their way to their goal which in this case is a glass of ice cold beer in Alexandria on the coast.The interplay between the characters and the growing bond they have in adversity is well played by the actors. John Mills' deeply troubled captain is particularly well acted. Harry Andrews Anthony Quayle and Sylvia Syms are fine too. The other main character is the ambulance itself gradually coming to pieces on the way steaming and bumping along.J. Lee Thompson was a very able director and there are some excellent scenes here. The minefield scene near the beginning and the hill scene near the end are great tense and emotional. The beer scene is moving and uplifting. The best British films about the Second World War are generally about a small group of ordinary people who faced with crisis and peril just get on with it.".

The other main character is the ambulance itself gradually coming to pieces on the way steaming and bumping along.J. Lee Thompson was a very able director and there are some excellent scenes here. The minefield scene near the beginning and the hill scene near the end are great tense and emotional. The beer scene is moving and uplifting. The best British films about the Second World War are generally about a small group of ordinary people who faced with crisis and peril just get on with it.";

	schema:headline " A fine taut British war film with fine performances and some unusual aspects";
	schema:reviewBody "Four people in an ambulance are struggling to cross the hot blinding North African desert on their way from Tobruk to Alexandria. It's 1942 and Rommel's Africa Corps is just about to take Tobruk and continue its race to Egypt. There is Captain Anson a blond John Mills an ambulance officer stressed to the breaking point and just this shy of being an alcoholic Sergeant Major Tom Pugh Harry Andrews a big capable lifer who has been with Anson for several months and knows his weaknesses Diana Murdoch Sylvia Syms a nurse who was stranded in Tobruk who has a steady hand but has seen her friend another nurse die in an attack on the ambulance and Captain van der Poel Anthony Quayle a strong swaggering South African they meet in a deserted outpost. Captain Anson is persuaded to let van der Poel join them because van der Poel has three bottles of gin with him. He also carries something in a knapsack he refuses to let out of his sight. Ice Cold in Alex is one of the best of the war movies Britain produced in the Fifties. It sets up a small group of people on a tense journey through a desolate landscape in a brokendown ambulance. We get to know these people...and we begin to worry whether Captain Anson is going to lose it every time he gets close to a bottle whether van der Poel is truly a South African or a German spy whether it will be Sergeant Pugh or Nurse Syms or van der Poel who'll get killed in one of the dangerous situations they encounter. And the movie has plenty of welldirected tense situations coming one after the other. The four of them encounter mine fields that must be crossed sand storms Nazi ambushes and pursuits capture by German troops they must talk their way out of with van der Poel coming in handy mechanical breakdowns and quicksand. And if there is one lesson they all learn it's to never park your vehicle on the top of a giant sand dune. The movie is unusual in that the hero is damaged goods. John Mills is excellent in portraying Captain Anson as a determined and stalwart British officer. He's even better at showing this man just a bit too eager for a drink too quick to justify it too close to breaking down when things don't work out. Mills was not a big man and he has to dominate the movie next to two very big men Harry Andrews and Anthony Quayle. Both are nearly a head taller than Mills. In one scene Mills as Anson collapses and Quayle must pick him up carry him several steps to the rear of the ambulance and deposit him inside. This is all done in one shot. Quayle looks as if he's dealing with no more than a 50 pound bag of flour yet Mills is definitely the one we watch during the movie. His Captain Anson may be falling apart but he is determined to get the ambulance and its passengers to Alexandria. While he struggles to do so we can see that he's slowing pulling himself together. It's a nice performance. There also is almost no distraction from artificial romance. There is only the faintest hint of a possible relationship developing between Nurse Murdoch and Captain Anson just a brief moonlight nuzzle and much later a realistic recognition of Anson's continuing demons and the difficulty of making personal plans in wartime. The movie also gives a much more subtle approach to the German enemy. At the conclusion while the four of them are finally enjoying an icecold lager in an Alexandrian bar one of them points out that working together they beat the desert which was a bigger enemy than...well you'll need to see the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another one of those films I remember watching at a young age on TV on a wet Sunday afternoon. There are only certain scenes I remember clearly but having rewatched it today I realised for the first time just what a tremendous film it is. It's not your traditional war film there is very little fighting but that doesn't matter it's more about the characters and their battle for survival against the desert. But more of my thoughts later here's a brief summary first summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please help crank that ambulance up the slope while I write the next paragraph.I guess I'd better give you a bit of background first. The film is set in North Africa in World War II The British army are being pushed back along the coast of Libya towards Egypt by the Germans. Captain Anson MSM Tom Pugh and two nurses Sister Diana Murdoch and Sister Denise Norton are somehow left to find their own way to safety in an ambulance called 'Katy'. On the way they pick up a South African officer Captain van der Poel who at first seems OK but later they become suspicious of. Amongst all this intrigue Captain Anson comes to terms with his alcoholism and vows not to touch another drop until they get to Alexandria where he will have an icecold lager hence the title 'IceCold in Alex'. There is so much more I would like to say about this one but in the interests of not giving spoilers away I'll stop there.This is very much a character driven piece and as such you are easily drawn into the story. For the most part the four main characters are totally captivating and you will be surprised how quickly the time passes and it is quite a long film for its day. So excellent performances from John Mills as Captain Anson Sylvia Syms as Sister Diana Murdoch Anthony Quayle as Captain van der Poel and Harry Andrews as MSM Tom Pugh.In some parts of the world I believe this film is known as 'Desert Attack' a pretty bad title I'm afraid. It conveys nothing of what the film is about and may have either misled or put some viewers off. It's not perfect there are some technical issues and one moment that just didn't quite fit for me. But at the end of the day it's all about what they discover about Captain van der Poel and what they decide to do about it that makes this film so good. It's one of the best films I've seen that were made about World War II back in the days of black and white and so highly recommended.My score 8.610".

My wife understands and doesn't mock  after all I could be ranting on about Girls Aloud  grrr... Nicola .Anyhow the film. It is a fantastic piece of cinema and does truly evoke the loneliness of the desert and the small things that can tip one over the edge. I read an article once about Rommel and the North African campaign where he came across a couple of wounded Tommies next to their wrecked APC. Whereas the SS would have probably shot them there and then Rommel ensured the men were treated well had their wounds tended and were dropped off at the nearest Red Cross station.

	schema:reviewBody "ICE COLD IN ALEX 1958This British film is based on the novel of the same name by British author Christopher Landon. This WW2 film is set in 1942 North Africa at the time of the fall of Tobruk. John Mills headlines the production with Harry Andrews Sylvia Syms Diane Clare and Anthony Quayle.John Mills is in charge of a convoy of trucks and ambulances being evacuated from Tobrouk just before its capture by the German Afrika Korps. Mills and his Sgt Harry Andrews are given a pair of nurses to take along during the evacuation. The two nurses Sylvia Syms and Diane Clare had missed their ship out of Tobruk. Due to a number of factors the ambulance is cut off from the rest of the convoy. They need to drive out across the desert in order to reach the coast road back to British lines. They soon come up on a South African officer Anthony Quayle who joins up with the Tobruk escapees. Mills a man with an over fondness for the bottle likes that Quayle has several large bottles of gin with him. The first of several problems pop up a minefield is blocking their way to the coast road. With Andrews slowly driving Mills and Quayle lead the ambulance carrying the nurses through the mines. Now they have a run in with a German patrol and the truck gets shot up. The one nurse Clare is badly wounded. Anthony Quayle who just happens to speak German has a word with the Officer in charge of the patrol. The Germans are too busy chasing the retreating British army to worry about a one truck with a wounded nurse. The German officer Walter Gotell lets the group continue on their way.The wounded nurse Clare has been fatally hit and soon dies. She is buried out in the middle of nowhere with a simple cross to mark the grave. The other nurse Syms as well as the Sgt Andrews notice that Quayle is never without his pack. And that he goes off into the desert every morning and night at the same time. Mills figures the guy is just attending to his waste needs. Mills promises them all a tall glass of ice cold beer once they reach safety in Alexandria. Now there is another run in with a German patrol and again Quayle talks the Germans into releasing them. Now even Mills figure that something is wrong with this picture. He tells the others they need proof before they can say that Quayle is really a German spy. The group is now forced to head out into the dangerous terrain of the Quattara Depression. The area is full of quicksand and salt marshes where a truck and its contents could disappear beneath the surface. The group catches Quayle that night in the act of sending a message on a small portable radio that is kept in his pack. Quayle disposes of the evidence is a handy quicksand hole. He however gets caught in the same hole. The others just barely manage to pull him out of the trap with the truck tow rope. It is now on to Alex and safety as well as that cold beer. Mills gets Quayle to cough up his real name before the Military Police show up. Otherwise he will be shot as a spy by the British Army. He also grabs Quayle's fake id and dog tags before they are seen. They all now sit and wash the dust away with a couple glasses of ice cold beer. This is a very interesting tension filled film and is much better than I am making it sound. The film was directed by J. Lee Thompson. Thompson started out as a writer before switching to directing. His films include MURDER WITHOUT CRIME THE YELLOW BALLOON THE WEAK AND THE WICKED TIGER BAY WOMAN IN A DRESSING GOWN CAPE FEAR THE GUNS OF NAVARONE and KINGS OF THE SUN. Thompson received an Oscar nomination for his work on THE GUNS OF NAVARONE. There are two versions out the full length UK version which is the one written about here and the US version with 54 minutes cut from the runtime. Needless to say that one makes no sense.".

The movie has fine music and songs performed by children and nice background electronic soundtrack. The acting is very outspoken and frank. The movie itself consists of 2 large parts each of them also contains several smaller ones. Each piece is a kind of short story. All the stories are linked together. Though at first sight the film may seem very childish it is a mistake to judge it like this because it has some moral lessons to teach and more than a few witty jokes to consume.Watch out for a great spoof of our legendary action movie of 1970. The good old actor you should have guessed already is back in his genuine Red Army uniform. His ironic smile is there too. It also spoofs Little Red Riding Hood and The Taming of the Shrew in such charming ways that you have no choice but goggle.Open your ears to hear a few memorable songs performed by the talented children who are in charge of the highly entertaining atmosphere of the film. Their intrusion into the fabric of the movie is quite nice and each performance looks like a music video. One of the finest songs is the tram fantasy at the very end of the first part of the movie. It has got strange words and a very dreamy feel about it.Such films have magic which is present in Mr Charlie Chaplin's works. Sometimes lots of modern cinema samples must be just kicked aside and one of such films is to be rediscovered in all its glory. By the way watch out for a little Charles Chaplin in one of the performances dedicated to the art of cinema.The sequel to this movie  Kanikuly Petrova i Vasechkina  can be easily named the No.1 movie for kids making the impossible it beats the original on all grounds the sets the characters the tunes and songs are pure genius.If you miss its sequel you'll flush your life down the drain.10 out of 10 highly entertaining and highly sophisticated.

Sarah Patterson A Company of Wolves is not only beautiful but gives Snow White the spunky yet childlike quality needed to bring the young princess to life.  Miss Patterson also has a pleasant singing voice.  I highly recommend seeing this enchanting version of the classic story!!!".

Most saw this on the Disney Channel in the late 80's or mid 90's. It has gained the reputation of cult classic and is possibly awaiting a new DVD release.Starring Diana Rigg as the evil queen this adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale is not only faithful to it's source Right down the the eating of Snow White's liver but tells it as a delightful family musical. Having this be a musical made the tone lighter instead of dark and scary like the original fairy tale. Nicola Stapelton and Sarah Patterson are the embodiment of the character. Ms. Stapelton is exactly what I think of when I see Snow White as a young girl. Ms. Patterson is the total spitting image of the older Snow White. She is one of the most gorgeous actresses I have ever seen and it's a shame that she has drifted into oblivion.This production is lavish to say the least. The settings and sets are unbelievable. The queen's room is especially beautiful and weird.It reminded me of a mix of Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast and Dario Argento's Suspiria. It is stunning. The costumes are no less inspired.If you can find this great film get it! You won't regret it!".

I really wanted to like this film and there ARE some good things in it but it's not the Snow White it could have been. The script is at least a fairly faithful version of the original story which the Disney film for all it's charm was not. The music and songs by Michael Berz are above average and nicely staged. Both Sarah Patterson and Nicola Stapleton are well cast as the older and younger Snow White as is the prince. The production values are equally persuasive especially considering it was filmed mostly in Isreal. What's wrong then? Sadly enough to make the picture a less than enchanting experience. The Dwarfs are little more than obnoxious including the late veteran Billy Barty and there is an abundance of out of place humor which does nothing but jar the mood. But what really does the film in dramatically is the portrayal of the evil Queen here played by the usually magnificent Diana Rigg. It's the fault of the script that the character is written in such an over the top manner but Rigg hams it up for all she is worth. Her costumes are almost all hideous adding to the lampooning of the character who must be taken seriously if the story is to make sense. Yes by the climax of the movie the story switches to a darker mood but by then it's too late. Musical or not there is no reason to add burlesque to a classic story. Snow White might better have been left on the shelf.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's get down to the meat of the review shall we? I think we all know the story of Snow White well enough to skip the summary.First let's get the negative over with. Here are the movies bad points 1 The King's fate. Snow White and her father were extremely close. The movie made an effort to point it out. Then Snow White begs the huntsman not to kill her and she'll run away in the forest and never come back. The king is told his beloved daughter is dead and is so heartbroken he goes into battle and dies. How unfair! Snow White should have come back and told her father of the queen's scheme regardless of what she told the huntsman.2 The 'extraordinary band of tiny little men' with the exception of Billy Barty. They weren't endearing they just sort of all blended together into one dirty annoying mass. They seemed more concerned about Snow White as a servant than a family member and I never could remember who was who due to the rhyming names. Plus most of them had the personality of rocks.3 The Queen's costumes! I only saw one that I halfway liked and the rest were either blah or hideous. Don't even get me started on some of the headdresses! There were so many costume changes I can't believe they couldn't impress me just once.4 Some scenes dragged on too long and some weren't even needed. Take for instance Snow White's flight through the woods as a child. It just kept going and going with no real action except a confusing encounter with a wild dog and could have been cut into half at least. Even as a child at the height of my fascination with fairy tales I found the scene boring. There are a few others but I think you get the idea.On the plus side 1 The adult Snow White played by Sarah Patterson. Not only could I easily believe she was the fairest in the land she had the character of Snow White down as well. Kind and innocent to a fault as well as dignified and graceful not to mention industrious and cheerful. There was a subtle sensual quality to her a young woman on the verge of blooming.2 The Prince. He didn't have a lot of air time but the actor did a lot with it. Handsome and Verile with a strong singing voice and a soulful quality it's not hard to see why Snow White went off with him so quickly. Most of the time I'm rolling my eyes when the prince declares his love even as a kid but in this case I just go 'Awww.' 3 Snow White's parents. There was a natural sweet chemistry between them both of them fine actors. The king's grief upon her passing was heart wrenching. Usually in fairy tales life and death is a light matter but the movie managed to convey the importance of such a final event without getting depressing.4 The sets! From Snow White's lavish childhood bedroom to the drawn's rustic cozy cottage there is nothing but topnotch quality. You believe you have been transported to this fairy tale world and not once are you jarred from story moment.Everything that I have not mentioned falls into the average category.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always loved fairy tales as a child Snow White believe it or not isn't one of my favorates but that's just me though I do really like the story. It really supprised me when I discovered how many live action versions of this tale there were which shows how timeless this tale is. Yeah just like in an apple tree there are some bad apples bad adaptations of this tale but there are also good ones and this is one of them.This film is kinda another one of my childhood gems I mainly saw this on home video in my second grade class and I really liked it. Watching it as an adult I still like it what can I say I really have a soft spot for this movie.Supprising fact of this film it was from the Cannon film company which is one of my favorate movie companies as their famous for their series of action films. I honestly didn't expect them to try their hand in the fantasy genre but most movie companies always try to branch out which I like showing that they can do more. This was a volume in this series of live action adaptions of fairy tales this volume I honestly feel is the best one in my book.Not much to say production value is pretty good despite the limited budget Cannon as usual works with I felt they really did will with what they had the set pieces and costumes are all up to par even certain effects though not many but Snow White was never an effects show are on par because it's all practical no CGI bull crap.Music is soild though not that memorable which is the weak point of the film don't get me wrong the songs are fun but not exactly the kind I would play on my Ipod over and over but that's me. Though I really did like the one song that Sarah Patterson sings I was really supprised she could actually sing and it's a beautiful voice.But I think what really sticks out are in the performances. Diana Rigg is soild as the Evil Queen and yes I have seen The Avengers really like that show. She's a villan you love to dislike or even plan dislike as she really presses that wrong button as usual is vein narsistic self centered she's kinda funny there are bits of dry humor.The Dwarves are really good too just like in the Disney version each of them have some distinctive personalities . Though what's interesting is each of them have all different names that rymme. It kinda makes sense they would all have different names than the one's from the Disney version since in the original fairy tale none of them had any names. Billy Barty is one of them whom is defiantly no stranger to the fantasy genere as he was also in Willow and the underrated Masters of the Universe.But my favorate of course is Sarah Paterson as Snow White. When I was a kid I had the biggest crush on this actress she just radiates gogiousness she to me is one of my favorate live action versions of Snow she just fits the role like a glove not just in looks but in performance as she captures the persona which is sweet kind but also slightly nave and inexperienced with the outside world as she's lived a sheltered life most of her life but has like any person coming of age to get outside their comfort zone and see the world and find love. I do like from how the tale and performences are executed despite predictable I actually found myself caring about what happens in the story and Snow herself hoping things will turn out right for her and get the life she deserves. Overall if your looking for some really good live action versions of the classic fairy tale this vintage version is one to check out just like the tale itself it's timeless.Rating 3 and a half stars".

	schema:headline " Not the fairest of them all but a long way from an ugly duckling";
	schema:reviewBody "The most famous adaptation of Snow White and the one that will always be my favourite is the classic 1937 Disney film. This 1987 Cannon Movie Tales adaptation is not in the same league but for low budget this is pretty good and is one of the better Cannon Movie Tale films.Snow White 1987 does have a few problems with the biggest problem being some of the pacing the film does drag at times with scenes that go on a little too long. This is particularly true of the scene in the woods necessary but goes on too long and devoid of terror it was a scene that was terrifying in the Disney film but is pretty interminable here and it is further disadvantaged by the fakelooking animal stock footage. The low budget does show in the costumes like with most of Cannon's film with Beauty and the Beast being a notable exception with some of the Queen's costumes like her horrendously kitschy disguises being particularly hideous and do not flatter Diana Rigg at all one may argue that it suited the type of character this viewer would argue that they don't do anything for a character who is meant to be one of the most beautiful women in the land. There are a few spots where the humour courtesy of the Dwarfs' slapstick pratfalls is a touch out of place as well though most of it is very amusing and endearing.However generally Snow White is one of Cannon's betterlooking films with some of their most lavish set design especially the Queen's bedroom and the scary forest setting and very rustic and beautifully lit photography. The makeup is also good and there is a visually and dramatically imaginative touch with the Queen's demise at the end see it for yourself it is one of the most imaginatively done demises for any villain in a Cannon Movie Tales film. The incidental music is enchantingly whimsical and the songs are lively and catchy can listen to them all again with little problem. It's wittily and charmingly scripted with a light touch without dissolving into overcutesiness and a darker one without being traumatising like the Disney film there are a couple of emotional parts like the aftermath of the poisoned apple. The story while not as dark as the Grimm version is still more faithful generally in detail and spirit than Disney's version which some may like. While there are pacing issues it's not the case like The Emperor's New Clothes or The Frog Prince where the film is trying to extend a short story to feature length and not quite succeeding Snow White's story is very strong and actually has a good amount happening.Performances are good with a sweet Nicola Stapleton and a radiant and touchingly innocent Sarah Patterson as younger and older Snow White. The dwarfs do amuse with the most memorable being Billy Barty have sweet personalities and you can at least tell who's who. Diana Rigg is great sinister fun as the Queen with wonderfully arch delivery and steals the show quite easily. The prince has very little screen time but James Ian Wright gives the role a lot of poise and charm. All in all not bad at all for a low budget Snow White adaptation and one of Cannon's better outings. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Recall the fabulous 80s Knight Rider Wham! Peewee's Playhouse. It was a time of artistic innocence and as such it was the perfect era for fairytale adaptations. Cannon Movie Tales' Snow White falls squarely into that vibe and if you watch it with the mind of a child or literally with a child you'll indeed be transported to a fantasy land much removed from our 21st century gritty reality  cynicism.Scenes are bright songs are bouncy acting is delightfully melodramatic and the story is simple yet engaging. I hated it. But that's because I was expecting something a little edgier like maybe Willy Wonka made a decade prior. When I accepted that this was a true children's film not an adult's film under the guise of a children's film like Wonka I had a great time.This film adaptation one of Cannon Movie Tales' 9 installments is remarkably close to the Grimm's vision. For that reason the story may seem a little drawn out  redundant showing all 3 attempts by the Evil Queen to nix Snow White unlike the famous Disney version which showed only the apple. But I think this worked because it showed the Evil Queen's growing frustration obsession  Faustian descent into black magic all leading to the frenzied climax. It might be fun for you to read the Grimm's version before seeing this movie so you can see the pages come to life visually almost exactly as the story was meant it's only 5 pages on gutenberg.org. There is one small variation the ending which I won't ruin. I found it to be very symbolic poetic  satisfying much more than the original Grimm's ending which in Grimm tradition is rather sudden and extreme.Special effects are minimal but effective. Obviously there's no digital cgi instead the film relies on good old creative stunts like you'd see in Jean Cocteau's timeless Beauty and the Beast 1950 or the obscure Russian fantasy horror Viy 1967. I was really impressed and slightly creeped out by the talking mirror which was played by the head of Julian Chagrin painted white with no eyeballs partially thrust through the wall creating the simple yet convincing illusion that he's part of the frame.The acting as I said above is delightfully melodramatic as a fairytale should be. I agree with everyone else that Diana Rigg an exBond girl from the 70s Her Majesty's Secret Service is well cast as the Evil Queen cruel intimidating and oddly funny when she sings my favorite song from the film More Beautiful Than Me sort of a wicked tango in a minor key check it out on Youtube.Other songs range from fun to forgettable but none are bad. Something I found interesting was the way the song styles were deliberately anachronistic and inappropriate for the setting as with the aforementioned tango ...in 15th century Germany??.As far as fairytale adaptations go this one is worth the price of admission. The DVD is quite rare but occasionally you'll see one pop up on ebay for surprisingly cheap. The 2005 DVD is nonanamorphic letterboxed meaning it's made for standard 43 TV sets even though the film is widescreen and on widescreen tvs it doesn't fill the entire set. It would be nice to see this with the HD Bluray treatment some day. But considering for 20 years there were only a few VHS copies floating around it's great that this cute film is finally available on disc.".

Even watching it as an adult i love it the simplicity of going back to the days before everything was cgi or 3d! When they actually built all the props! Its such a wonderful wonderful adaptation! Sure the songs are a bit cheesy this was the eighties though dont forget but it all adds to it! Sarah Patterson plays the part of snow white well alluring yet innocent really pretty without being overly provocative. The dwarfs are fab especially billy Barty who appears in pretty much every cannon movie tale film! I cannot rave about this enough!

	schema:headline " A faithful adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "Although it isn't as endearing or charming as Disney's animated version I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I think both Nicola Stapleton and Sarah Patterson better known for her role as Rosaleen in Company of Wolves did a good job playing Snow White. Best part was played by the evil queen Mia Rig who really was evil. At least she was pretty in comparison to the evil queen from Disney who looked like a ghost and could never be the fairest of them all. The evil queen had so many costumes in which she could disguise and transform into a totally different person. She used her disguises 3 times to kill Snow White. That's right she needed 3 attempts for that. I'm glad they showed us in this version all of these attempts so people do know it was not only the poisonous apple.

The songs are nice not great but not over the top and fitting. I was a bit disappointed by the dwarfs however they do lack some kind of personality and too bad they have all the same sounding names ending on iddy.

I think both Nicola Stapleton and Sarah Patterson better known for her role as Rosaleen in Company of Wolves did a good job playing Snow White. Best part was played by the evil queen Mia Rig who really was evil. At least she was pretty in comparison to the evil queen from Disney who looked like a ghost and could never be the fairest of them all. The evil queen had so many costumes in which she could disguise and transform into a totally different person. She used her disguises 3 times to kill Snow White. That's right she needed 3 attempts for that. I'm glad they showed us in this version all of these attempts so people do know it was not only the poisonous apple.

Little Nicola Stapleton from 'Hansel and Gretel' is also featured as a baby Princess White and as usual she's keeper.i've always been impressed with Cannon's ability to turn out these family gems on such low budgets and with limited resources and still acquire interesting name actors and provide them with quality musical scores. i guess its cheap to film in the Holy Land.i won't pretend this is the great cinema that the animated Disney classic is. but it's better entertainment than it's usually given credit for and of the numerous TV and movie productions outside of Disney this is what i think the cutest and best production and the most suitable for small children.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cannon Movie Tales were a low budget string of films that had remarkably big stars in them but were really much too corny for most people's taste. I highly urge everyone to avoid the clunky adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. The only other one I've seen is Snow White which is marginally better... but that's damning with faint praise considering this version of Snow White isn't particularly good and has a considerable list of faults.Take for instance Snow White and the Prince's meeting. He meets her right after she is awakened from the poisoned apple instead of a revitalizing kiss the piece is jostled out of her mouth. Instead of a courtship they immediately marry in what is easily the most joyless and mechanical wedding to ever appear in a children's film. Neither couple looks remotely happy. It could be because they haven't had a properly dated but then when has that ever been important in fairy tales? Couldn't one of them at least crack a hint of a smile? As the Evil Queen Diana Rigg seems to channel Gloria Swanson from Sunset Boulevard. In every scene Rigg was in I waited with baited breath to hear her say All right Mr. De Mille I'm ready for my closeup! Rigg also has a dreadful musical number and the poor dear can't sing a note and an appallingly hideous wardrobe. We're talking foothigh headdresses and shapeless sequined tunics. Don't you think someone as vain as the Queen would be a little more fashion savvy than this? The editing is also inexcusably poor. When little Snow White Nicola Stapleton is running from the hunter trying to kill her there are random stock footage closeups of animals that play no part in the scene whatsoever like the lingering shot of a python that has no payoff at all. And for such a climactic pivotal scene it was rather boring and ineffective.The dwarfs are at least partially amusing acting like a bunch of aging vaudevillians and painfully attractive brunette Sarah Patterson The Company of Wolves plays Snow White. She brings nothing new to the part but since Snow White isn't supposed to be interesting that's to be expected.Normally I write reviews warning people against bad movies. However this version of Snow White is worth a watch for its corny screenplay bad acting and some of the most ridiculous sequences ever. Remember when I mentioned the poisoned piece of apple coming out of Snow White's mouth? It actually flies out of her mouth in a hilarious bad blue screen effect and soars through the sky and hits the Evil Queen in the head. Words fail me.Grab a movie buddy and have a some MST3Kstyle quips ready for this delightfully campy fairy tale.".

Diana Rigg of the television show The Avengers delivers the only worthwhile performance and nobody else stands out in this lackluster but more accurate rendition of the classic yarn. The action starts with the Prince discovering the glass coffin with Snow White in it. Afterward we learn that the mother of our heroine died after she gave birth and the dad married the Evil Queen. The Evil Queen wants to destroy Snow White because her mirror reminds her that she is the fairest of the fair and the Queen refuses to be upstaged. She orders a huntsman to take the young beauty into the woods and kill her. The Evil Queen demands that the Huntsman brings back the heart of the heroine so she can keep it in a box. Alas the poor fellow does not have the nerve to do such a dastardly deed. Anyway Snow White flees and winds up at the house of the seven dwarfs and becomes their housekeeper. She cooks their meals and keeps their home clean. Years pass and the Evil Queen learns from her mirror that the damsel has survived so she sets out to kill her by herself. Initially she laces a bodice on Snow White and our heroine passes out and the Queen leaves. The dwarfs cut the bodice off and Snow White recovers. The Queen masquerades the second time as an Asian woman and gives Snow White a deadly comb. Again the dwarfs saw the day. By now the dwarfs have warned the witless Snow White to not open the door and let anybody into their house. Finally the Queen tries again and gives Snow White a poison apple. No Snow White does not open the door but the Queen manages to get the apple to her and our heroine winds up unconscious on the floor again. Sarah Patterson of The Company of Wolves is pretty but she doesn't do much other than look pretty. Billy Barty who parlayed his short stature into a film career plays one of the dwarfs. Eventually the Queen learns that Snow White survived the apple and is about to be married to a prince in an adjacent kingdom. The Queen shatters her own mirror and sets off to attend the wedding not knowing that as each shard of the mirror falls to the ground that she grows even older and more ugly. Again Diana Rigg is the only reason to watch writer director Michael Berz's version of this story".

	schema:headline " Gene Fresh On The Scene";
	schema:reviewBody "The sequel to the previous year's Jesse James 1939 The Return of Frank James is a perfectly entertaining fastmoving Western that is historically important for two reasons It was director Fritz Lang's first picture to be shot in color and it served as the setting for the debut of one of Hollywood's most beloved actresses Gene Tierney. In her 1979 autobiography SelfPortrait Gene tells us that Fox Studio head Darryl F. Zanuck had seen her performing on Broadway in 1940 in The Male Animal and immediately offered her a contract. After a previous stalled career in Hollywood however Geneand her familymanaged to finagle an unusually liberal deal from the studio chief 750 a week with a raise every six months and the freedom to return to Broadway for half the year an option that Gene never took advantage of AND the right to make no changes to her hair or soontobefamous teeth. In her first film for Fox 20yearold Gene played the role of Eleanor Stone a liberated woman and nascent reporter on the Denver Star newspaper of 1882. She is duped by Frank James Henry Fonda and his sidekick Clem Jackie Cooper who had grown up a LOT since playing the role of kids a mere 10 years before in films such as 1931's The Champ into writing a false story of the outlaw's demise so that he might more easily track down the Ford brothers John Carradine and Charles Tanner who had just shot Jesse in the back and gotten away with it. Gene is excellent in her ingenue role fresh faced and dewy eyed and hardly deserving of Harvard Lampoon's The Worst Female Discovery of 1940 citation.As for the rest of the film it is nicely shot and filled with amusing characters and situations. Besides Fonda and Carradine Donald Meek returns in this sequel a bit tougher than usual as the conniving railroad man McCoy as does Henry Hull almost stealing the show as Frank's buddy Major Rufus Cobb. The film contains surprisingly little action per se although a horse chase through the Rockies and resultant gunfight coming at the picture's midpoint are very well executed. Fonda who had worked with Lang before in 1937's You Only Live Once is very fine here as Frank James sympathetic cool and tough a reformed badman with a conscience and perhaps only 1100th as nasty as he would be 30 years or so later playing another Frank in Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. Tierney apparently absolutely adored working with Fonda especially after he defended her against the director. As Tierney reveals in her book she had the unfortunate habit of keeping her mouth slightly parted when she wasn't speaking an adorable habit sez me! and Lang chastised her severely for it yelling You little bitch! When you have no lines keep your mouth shut! Little could Lang know that that mouth and those teeth would soon make Gene one of THE preeminent screen goddesses of the 1940s! Anyway although The Return of Frank James has been faulted elsewhere for its many historical inaccuracies it remains a fun enough diversion. Capped off by one of the most amusing trial scenes since The Three Stooges' Disorder in the Court the film is perfect for all ages and most especially of course for fans of Miss Gene Tierney....".

	onyx:emotionText "The sequel to the previous year's Jesse James 1939 The Return of Frank James is a perfectly entertaining fastmoving Western that is historically important for two reasons It was director Fritz Lang's first picture to be shot in color and it served as the setting for the debut of one of Hollywood's most beloved actresses Gene Tierney. In her 1979 autobiography SelfPortrait Gene tells us that Fox Studio head Darryl F. Zanuck had seen her performing on Broadway in 1940 in The Male Animal and immediately offered her a contract. After a previous stalled career in Hollywood however Geneand her familymanaged to finagle an unusually liberal deal from the studio chief 750 a week with a raise every six months and the freedom to return to Broadway for half the year an option that Gene never took advantage of AND the right to make no changes to her hair or soontobefamous teeth. In her first film for Fox 20yearold Gene played the role of Eleanor Stone a liberated woman and nascent reporter on the Denver Star newspaper of 1882. She is duped by Frank James Henry Fonda and his sidekick Clem Jackie Cooper who had grown up a LOT since playing the role of kids a mere 10 years before in films such as 1931's The Champ into writing a false story of the outlaw's demise so that he might more easily track down the Ford brothers John Carradine and Charles Tanner who had just shot Jesse in the back and gotten away with it. Gene is excellent in her ingenue role fresh faced and dewy eyed and hardly deserving of Harvard Lampoon's The Worst Female Discovery of 1940 citation.As for the rest of the film it is nicely shot and filled with amusing characters and situations. Besides Fonda and Carradine Donald Meek returns in this sequel a bit tougher than usual as the conniving railroad man McCoy as does Henry Hull almost stealing the show as Frank's buddy Major Rufus Cobb. The film contains surprisingly little action per se although a horse chase through the Rockies and resultant gunfight coming at the picture's midpoint are very well executed.

Some say the man did it in revenge for Jesse's murder but that is likely just speculation. Gene Tierney and the scenery are beautifully photographed in gorgeous technicolor throughout.".

	schema:headline " A pale watery excuse for a western but with lots of great archetypes";
	schema:reviewBody "The Return of Frank James 1940The Western is back as of 1939 when four big ones were released including John Ford's Stagecoach with John Wayne which has lasting critical acclaim and also Jesse James which was the fourth largest moneymaker for that blockbuster year. Maybe it was the war breaking out in Europe or just a realization that if you lifted a Western from its usual Bmovie status the public would respond. Henry Fonda starred as Frank James in that one and so this is really a sequel with the same chronology and feel as the first one. It is clearly Alist movie material with genuine Technicolor a year after Jesse James The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind had all made clear Technicolor was no passing gimmick.Frank James is now out to seek the killers of the more famous outlaw. The fact we are rooting for the renegade through his surviving brother is slightly oddthe antihero or negative stereotype as protagonist wasn't really respectable or possible until the 1960s full fledged. Jesse James was a brave Civil War guerrilla fighter but he became an uncommonly violent criminal and murderer after the war. Frank James was probably as ruthless and bad he was part of the same gang but after the death of Jesse he escaped prison in real life and lived into the Twentieth Century.In this movie Frank is not portrayed as a bad person. He just wants his brother's killers dead. And Henry Fonda is a kind of low key determined fellow throughout. We naturally run into the standard assortment of types that are almost required in period Westernsdrunks and sheriffs and pretty girls out of place in this rough manly world. And there are shoot outs and a court trial and so on.Of all people to approach this genre and in color you'd least expect Fritz Lang the recent migr with Metropolis and M and Fury all in his portfolio.

	onyx:emotionText "The Return of Frank James 1940The Western is back as of 1939 when four big ones were released including John Ford's Stagecoach with John Wayne which has lasting critical acclaim and also Jesse James which was the fourth largest moneymaker for that blockbuster year. Maybe it was the war breaking out in Europe or just a realization that if you lifted a Western from its usual Bmovie status the public would respond. Henry Fonda starred as Frank James in that one and so this is really a sequel with the same chronology and feel as the first one. It is clearly Alist movie material with genuine Technicolor a year after Jesse James The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind had all made clear Technicolor was no passing gimmick.Frank James is now out to seek the killers of the more famous outlaw. The fact we are rooting for the renegade through his surviving brother is slightly oddthe antihero or negative stereotype as protagonist wasn't really respectable or possible until the 1960s full fledged. Jesse James was a brave Civil War guerrilla fighter but he became an uncommonly violent criminal and murderer after the war. Frank James was probably as ruthless and bad he was part of the same gang but after the death of Jesse he escaped prison in real life and lived into the Twentieth Century.In this movie Frank is not portrayed as a bad person. He just wants his brother's killers dead. And Henry Fonda is a kind of low key determined fellow throughout. We naturally run into the standard assortment of types that are almost required in period Westernsdrunks and sheriffs and pretty girls out of place in this rough manly world. And there are shoot outs and a court trial and so on.Of all people to approach this genre and in color you'd least expect Fritz Lang the recent migr with Metropolis and M and Fury all in his portfolio. He gets rising star Henry Fonda in the loner lead for this sequel naturally and Fonda is the meat of it really terrific in an echo actually of the loner lead in John Ford's Grapes of Wrath in the same year. And then there's Gene Tierney playing a pseudoreporter in her very first film role showing early on that she is mostly a pretty face but a decent actress at least.

Well it was directed by Fritz Langthat's enough reason to see it. But it also stars Henry Fondaand I'd watch him in anything.This film begins around the same time Jesse James was killed. It concerns his brother Frank and his actions following this death. Unfortunately most of what you see never actually occurredand Frank played no part in the deaths of the Ford Brothersnone. In fact Frank gave himself up was tried for some of his crimes and acquitted and retired to a relatively normal life. 'Frankly' I'd love to see a film about thisabout the many odd jobs he did and the things he did after retirementbut I also doubt if the public would really care! I guess the truth just isn't very interesting in most cases.So it's obvious that the plot was almost complete crap. What did I think about the film otherwise? Well it was pretty to seebeing in Technicolor. And Fonda's performance was niceas usual. In fact the entire film is competentjust nearly all wrong! This actually makes one scene in the movie VERY ironicand funny. Frank is enjoying a play when suddenly out come two actors pretending to be him and Jesseand naturally the two actors are doing things the James' never did! I'm pretty sure the studio didn't see this as ironic or funny.By the way at the 41 minute mark you see a couple horses make some horrifically bad falls. Sadly to get this wonderful effect the studios would actually use trip wires like piano wire to make the horses falland often the horses would break their legs and need to be euthanized! Fortunately this practice was later abandoned when bad publicity for this cruel thing brought this to light.".

The law find the two men guilty of murder regardless of what the victim had done but thirty minutes later and the Governor has pardoned them. Keen to avenge his brother's wrongful murder Frank leaves his remote farm and heads out after the killers. Tangling with the law early on he can no longer rely on the rumour that he has been shot dead himself and finds himself a prey while at the same time being a hunter.I was looking forward to this film because the themes of revenge violence and their affects are often ideas that Fritz Lang has managed to do interesting work with. So regardless of the western setting and the colourful Technicolor presentation I decided to give this a go. The promise is there early on and as Frank starts to give up his quiet life to pick his guns up again the film seems to chicken out of looking at his dark side at all. This means that the film isn't as interesting as I hoped it would be but doesn't mean that it isn't a solid western because it is. It is a bit slower than many genre fans will be looking for but it does the basics well enough and I enjoyed the mix of dramatic and the amusing even if it doesn't really amount to that much.Lang's direction is good although it is only in the odd scene where I felt he was doing something interesting the scene in the barn near the end is the best one  all shadow and atmosphere. The cast are solid enough to make the material work. Fonda has the ability to go darker as an actor but he doesn't here for whatever reason. His performance suits the matine western of the film but doesn't do anything more interesting than that. Tierney is pretty and has some chemistry with Fonda but the story could have done without her she was meant to be a love interest but it was dropped as an idea. Support from Cooper Hull Carradine and others is roundly good with everyone delivering the goods on the genre level this was working at.Overall then an entertaining enough western that will probably satisfy genre fans. However with an actor and director that are given an interesting theme to work with this should have been much better than it was and I must confess that I was a bit disappointed. Should work for a boring afternoon's viewing though.".

The chases try to duplicate King's by having sound effects and no music but they are tame. The film also suffers by the casting and the writing of the Ben Cooper character who is made to seem not only conventional but unsympathetic. On the other hand Henry Hull does come across just a shade less fulminating here and is all the better for it. The climactic courtroom scene with the exchanges between Hull Barbier and Hicks is the most entertaining and gripping in the film. But still westerns fans didn't come to see a good courtroom scene. Gene Tierney looks nice though and Donald Meek carries forward his characterization from Jesse James. Fonda is much the same but unfortunately there is no Randolph Scott to help him carry the film.

	schema:headline " Fonda Carradine Gene Tierney and especially Henry Hull make for a fun drama.";
	schema:reviewBody "1939 and '40 saw Henry Fonda involved in his greatest string of classic biops and classic novel film adaptations though not always the lead character nor most remembered character. This includes Jesse James. Young Mr. Lincoln Drums along the Mohawk and The Story of Alexander Graham Bell in '39 followed by the '40 The Grapes of Wrath as well as the present film where he reprises his role as Frank James in a sequel to Jesse James his brother having been killed at the end of the previous film and he out to do justice to his brother by assassinating the killer. While this film scores significantly lower mean rating at this site than these other films I find it the most entertaining of the bunch having seen it numerous times over the years. Never mind the gross historical inaccuracies and many contrivances of the screenplay. Like Jesse James it was a rare film of the times shot in Technicolor. It makes sense that Frank might try to kill the assassin of his brother. Historically it just didn't happen that way. Incidentally this site has it wrong that the Ford brothers died within a few months of killing Jesse. Brother Charlie killed himself 2 years later while suffering from terminal TB. Brother Bob lived another 10 years moving around to several parts of the West but not Denver as portrayed in the film. However at one point in the film Frank and adopted son ClemJackie Cooper are riding to catch BobJohn Carradine in the mining town of Creede CO to which Bob fled after Frank and Clem chased him out of Denver. Historically this is where Bob was finally assassinated after setting up a business there. However that's not how the screenplay tells it. Also the theatrical play in Denver in which the James brothers hold up a woman to be thwarted by the Ford brothers alludes to the historical fact that Bob did stage reenactments of his killing of Jesse in the early years after the deed. Frank's appearance in the balcony induces Bob to flee Frank jumping to the stage Boothlike in pursuit.Gorgeous Gene Tierney has her first film role as leading lady Eleanor Stone the late teen daughter of the editor of a Denver newspaper. She seems a tad formal in her demeanor and deliveries perhaps due to her scripted finishing school training. Also I see what she meant when she reportedly began smoking to hopefully lower her voice as it does sound a bit like Minnie Mouse here at times. ..The original idea was that she and Frank would form a romantic pair. However due to outside considerations it was decided to tone down this romance resulting in an awkward goodbye scene to end the film.Although Frank was involved in 3 gun battles that resulted in 3 deaths the screenwriter was careful not to implicate a bullet from Frank's gun as being directly responsible for any of these deaths. During his night robbery of the Midland Express office a bullet fired from outside into the building was shown as causing the death of the watchman blamed on Frank. During a gun battle with Charlie Ford Charlie slipped on a high ledge to his death. The final drama of the film has Frank engaged in a hide and seek shootout with Bob in a dark livery stable. Bob had just engaged in a gun battle with Clem outside the courtroom immediately after Frank was acquitted of charges. As it turned out the wounds Bob and Clem inflicted on each other proved fatal within a short time Bob dying from Clem's bullet while engaging Frankat least it's fairly novel.Humor is mainly concentrated in 2 segments. First Clem's fanciful story about how Frank died in a gun battle in Mexico which EleanorGene has printed in the newspaper to her later embarrassment. Also the related tying up of bespeckled railroad detective Runyan in their hotel room stuffing him in their closet to be discovered by the freakedout maid....But the major theatrics are provided by Henry Hull in part in bits here and there but concentrated during Frank's trial in which he serves as the defense council attacking the prosecution and defending his client with all the awesome fury of an enraged pit bull injecting bits of sarcasm and humor here and there. This is what you will most remember about this film! Fonda occasionally adds his own dose of laconic sarcasm in remembrance of the rather similar court scene in the previous year's Young Mr. Lincoln. In that scene Fonda was the defense attorney and Donald Meek who has a subsidiary role in the court scene in the present film was the prosecuting attorney. Fonda played Lincoln's laconic self very different from Hull's continuously bombastic performance. Tall imposing Russell Hicks takes the place of short balding Meek as the prosecuting attorney in the present film. Although like John Carradine he played a role in several hundred films this is the only one I remember him in. The trial nearly turns into a reenactment of the Civil War as Hull recounts in dramatic fashion the probable killings of Yankees by Frank's revolver'weepin' and the depredations of the blue coats and other Yankees on the local southern sympathizers. Despite Frank's admitted guilt in robbing the Midland office not to mention forcing another railroad watchman to flag down an express train so Frank and Clem could hurry to KC to hopefully prevent the execution of their innocent friend Pinky the jury incredulously declares Frank not guilty of all charges. This dramatically shows the still very antiYankee feeling of the people in this region. Historically Frank was acquitted of the several charges relating to the robberies of the James Gang although he spent a year in jail awaiting trial.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's an engaging Western. Henry Fonda is Frank James in postcivil war Missouri. His brother Jesse is dead killed by the Ford brothers and engineered by the railroad. Many of the characters are carried over from Jesse James a year or two earlier.Poor Fritz Lang. From the monumental Metropolis to Jesse James' less colorful older brother. Such was the fate of many who were escaping the Nazis. Lang's wife was Jewish but he was thought so highly of that he was asked by Goebbels to head the propaganda division of the Third Reich. According to Lang his reply to Goebbels was I'm tickled pink and then he was on the fastest airplane out of Germany. He went on to film some very effective noirs in the 50s including The Woman in the Window and Scarlet Street. However here he is behind the camera on a sequel. And it's not bad. The script is proficient though without the exciting action scenes of the forebear but shot in the magnificent color that was characteristic of 20thCentury Fox Studios at the time. This movie is suitably dark but some of the studio's musicals were in such loud colors that they resembled animated cartoons.Anyway Jesse James was shot in the back by the Bob Ford and his brother. Frank quickly dispatches the other ford but Bob remains an elusive target. In the course of his pursuit Frank James stages his own death and assumes a different identity. In this peaceful guise he runs into Gene Tierney a woman of sass and principle for whom saving a life is better than causing a death.It gets complicated but winds up a courtroom drama in which the plainspoken Frank is being tried for murder. He's defended by the choleric Henry Hull newspaper editor and lawyer. Hull shouts his lines including a paraphrase of Shakespeare from Henry VI Part 2 in which a revolutionary cries The first thing we do let's kill all the lawyers. Frank James is found guilty and is drawn and quartered his intestines spilling out the giddy spectators splattered with blood. Just kidding. He gets off.It's WHY he gets off that's a little disturbing. The narrative is involving but its values are those of Gone With the Wind and Birth of a Nation. The Confederaly was good and the Yankees were bad and that's all there is to it. All the heavies are cowards. And they're the cause of all dysfunction. The prosecutor in the case for instance is a man who is being paid by the Yankee railroad. He's made ridiculous. The judge is biased the jury is biased the defense is biased the audience is biased and the viewers  willy nilly  endorse the notion that the Confederacy was good partly because a man settled his own affairs like shooting his enemies in the front instead of the back.Disregarding that Henry Fonda does a nice job as a subdued ex bandit driven by family honor. Henry Hull's character has only one dimension but it's an amusing one. Gene Tierney is exquisite but has a voice that  if a mouse could speak  would sound like a mouse's.Treat it as fiction and enjoy it.".

A verbal faceoff with him and Fonda would have salvaged a lot. The Technicolor however is vivid the scenic shots in and around Lone Pine real eyecatchers. Too bad we don't get more of that instead of the near silly courtroom scenes. At the same time luscious Gene Tierney is almost as scenic as Lone Pine even if her performance is still at a beginner's stage.

Repeating its opening and closing credit score conducted for JESSE JAMES along with its Technicolor splendor and location filming that served the earlier film so well FRANK JAMES elevates Fonda from secondary character to top draw leading attraction. While this extension might have reused the services of JESSE JAMES director Henry King it comes of a surprise in having not Howard Hawks or John Ford whose best films happen to be westerns but the European born Fritz Lang. Yet under his watch the result of THE RETURN OF FRANK JAMES is every bit as good as the original.The fadein begins with the closing minutes of JESSE JAMES where the wanted outlaw Tyrone Power gets shot in the back by his friend Bob Ford John Carradine as his brother Charlie Charles Tannen watches. Eliminating the eulogy given by Rufus Cobb Henry Hull that closed the original film THE RETURN OF FRANK JAMES opens its new chapter with newspaper headlines depicting the death of the notorious outlaw and the disappearance of his brother Frank James after the Northfield robbery now believed to be dead. Frank Henry Fonda however isn't dead but living a secluded farm life in the Ozarks under an assumed name of Ben Woodson. He's accompanied by the family farmhand Pinky Washington Ernest Whitman and Clem Jackie Cooper an orphan teenager whom Frank had taken in following the death of his father. It is Clem who runs over to Frank with the news about Jesse James murder and the arrest of the Ford brothers. After learning the Fords were set free from the judge a half hour of the guilty verdict from the jurors and having collected the 10000 reward on Jesse dead or alive Frank breaks from his seclusion to take the law into his own hands by avenging his brother's killers. Along the way Frank and Clem now acting as his tagalong sidekick encounter Eleanor Stone Gene Tierney a reporter for the Denver Star hoping for a good story or else her father Randolph Lloyd Corrigan owner of the newspaper would send her off to college instead.Aside from the tobacco chewing Henry Fonda playing Frank James others reprising their original roles from JESSE JAMES include the ever reliable Henry Hull Major Rufus Cobb editor of the Liberty Weekly Gazette still using the catch phrase Shoot them down like dogs J. Edward Bromberg George Runyan the railroad detective out to expose Ben Woodson as Frank James Donald Meek McCoy the railroad president responsible for having the Ford brothers betray their leader Jesse and arranging for their pardon and George ChandlerRoy Cobb's typesetter. New members of the cast include George Barbier Judge Ferris Eddie Collins The Station Agent Barbara Pepper Nellie Blane stage actress and Victor Kilian The Fanatic Preacher.For Gene Tierney's movie debut she gets no special introduction in the credits. Only her name comes billed second under Henry Fonda which is an honor for any newcomer. A dark beauty with girlish sounding voice reminiscent in both factors to an early 1930s actress Sidney Fox best known for 1932s Murders in the Rue Morgue Tierney doesn't play a love interest but one interested in reporting the news that's fit to print. She does quite well in her first try as a movie actress and would improve with each succeeding movie before reaching her peak with LAURA 20th CenturyFox 1944.As with JESSE JAMES THE RETURN OF FRANK JAMES with original screenplay by Sam Hellman toys with the facts resulting to better screen entertainment. While the first hour depicts on Frank's vengeance on the Ford brothers with a tense moment having the Fords acting on a stage play The Death of Jesse James observe Frank sitting in the theater box looking down at them the second half shifts to courtroom proceedings with Frank accused of a murder and Major Cobb acting as his defendant. Though Fritz Lang may have avoided borrowing from Henry King's directorial style from JESSE JAMES interestingly the courtroom segment comes as a sheer reminder to John Ford's YOUNG MR. LINCOLN 1939 also starring Henry Fonda by using humor over tense action for the proceedings. Like King Lang keeps the pace moving with exciting horseback chases and shootouts something very much expected for any western.Though the second and last of the Frank and Jesse James westerns for the studio this wasn't the last depiction on their lives presented on screen. Lippert Studios independently produced two totally different adaptations I SHOT JESSE JAMES 1949 and THE RETURN OF JESSE JAMES 1950 with the latter costarring Henry Hull in a different character portrayal.

Other numerous westerns on the Jesse and Frank James would follow for many years to come.Distributed to home video and later DVD THE RETURN OF FRANK JAMES consisted of cable TV broadcasts as Turner Network Television 199495 American Movie Classics 19992005 Fox Movie Channel Encore Westerns Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere December 27 2012 among others. With this much television exposure Frank James should become more legendary than his kid brother Jesse. 12";

But it does'nt really matter if Fonda did not want to do Jesse James or Return of Frank James because he has such a great acting ability which he displays on screen. I think this one is superior to Jesse James for many reasons all of which are hard to explain. Cooper turns in a worthy role as Frank's sidekick Clem. But don't you think that the AfricanAmerican servant is kind of silly? Some people say that Carradine is not a good villain but when that happens just refer to McCoy and Co. to fill in that role. I love Henry Hull's character especially his rantings and ravings in the courthouse and also his rantings and ravings while he paces up and down the floor of his newspaper office. There isn't very many people that he does not think should be taken out and shot down like a dog is there?".

	schema:reviewBody "While some may compare this to Brick the 2005 similarlyset High School film noir Assassination is much more comparable to Chinatown which is clearly it's biggest influence. In fact you'll see lines lifted right out of the film. But is it good? Yes actually it's quite good. Clearly the filmmakers here were not taking this quite as seriously as either Brick or Chinatown and it pays off with a fun funny sometime campy film noir with a good mystery and some well acted roles.The writing presents a stylish script with dialogue that is often funny and over the top. Bruce Willis is especially mentionable as a veteranturnedprinciple who pines over his time spent in the military taking out bad guys and his hate for chewing gum. He's perfectly over the top. Reece Thompson also does a great job as the lead character playing up the gumshoe role with relish. It's fun to see him be him and follow him on his journey.One line in the film goes something like high school is simple...yet it's not. The film does a particularly good job of showing this throughout in scenes that inspire laughs. We have a suspension hall that acts like a prison and is presented in such a way as to inspire this comparison. We have an assassination attempt that...well I won't spoil it. But suffice to say this scene in particular demonstrates exactly what I am talking about. It's a good revelation of how high school can be in the end it seems simple but while in high school can be anything but.The film is very entertaining and should be fun for anyone looking for a good noir. It's not serious like it's inspirations but it does contain a good mystery some good acting stints and some fun dialogue. I recommend it for anyone looking for something slightly different to watch on a Saturday night.".

As fortune would have it a crime happens  the SATs are stolen from the office of Principal Kirkpatrick Bruce Willis playing Bruce Willis and Booby is on the investigation and story a story that points to Paul as the perpetrator. Bobby's nerdiness is transformed by his attention and by the affections of Francesca and soon the school collapses under the cloud of the crime. It is how the 'crime' is inspected and resolved that ends the film. For Bobby Funke it is a matter of 'What price glory'. The cast is fresh and it is a pleasure to see some new faces with promise. Whether it is the director's or the sound mixer's fault much of the dialogue is swallowed by the soundtrack a problem thankfully solved by turning on the subtitles. This is a movie with promise from all involved and it will be interesting to see if it has an impact on teen flick quality. Grady Harp".

It seemed like a low budget stylized sort of art film that managed to pull in some mid level stars and in aging one in Bruce Willis. Not my kind of film. I was wrong!apparently ignoring my gut turns out to be a good idea but usually it's still tortureThis was really a fun quirky little movie that I actually enjoyed. The story is fairly sophomoric. A high school cheating scandal that the student newspaper and the grizzled old war veteran Principal Bruce Willis are trying to get to the bottom of.The acting in this one is admittedly over the top but that is the strength of this movie. It is suppose to be over the top which provides the humor throughout. Mischa Barton plays the pretty girl so that was no stretch Bruce Willis's tough guy image works wonderfully for his character as well.I won't get into the whole plot storyline as anyone can read it above but it was a pleasantly surprising humorous story that I would definitely recommend. I am usually not even into this kind of movie but I really enjoyed it. It was much better than sitting through another stupid Harry Potter movie that's for sure.So if you find yourself bored with nothing to watch pop this fun little gem in the DVD player.

	schema:reviewBody "Assassination of a High School President is a pleasant surprise a high school noir comedy where the joke is how seriously it takes itself. It never leaves the classroom  nothing that happens in it is too ridiculous  but it maintains a consistent sense of epic importance that successfully subverts and is subverted by its own fairly mundane story. On that level it's sort of brilliant we understand how important the events of the story are to the characters while never losing track of how comically meager they are to us the seasoned moviegoers. Now just reading that I can't imagine a more effective way of representing secondary school.The story is this wannabe star reporter of the school newspaper Bobby Funke Reece Thompson gets a puff piece on student body president Paul More Patrick Taylor at the same time a stack of SATs are stolen right out of Principal Kirpatrick's Bruce Willis office. Kirpatrick appoints Bobby as his head investigator and it turns out the two stories are deeply connected. More than that I will not say although keep in mind this film is closer to Wes Anderson than James M. Cain.And another thing it isn't is Rian Johnson's Brick. Its 2005 genre predecessor and Miller's Crossing ripoff that was the film where Joseph GordonLevitt was a downandout student playing two high school gangs against each other. It's the movie this one has been most compared to unfavourably although the two are nothing alike. Brick was a film of dead weight a leaden drama with aged and dreary characters and a story meant to confuse and depress you. It was a gangly nearly incomprehensible movie that's gained cult status mainly I think because most of its fans don't understand it. It was a movie with a story and setting that never came together and with a sensibility and technique more heavyhanded than the worst Hollywood message movie.Assassination just wants to make you laugh and in the process laugh off the petty issues that plague high school life I can see it being almost therapeutic for kids facing those problems today. It sparkles with an understated wit and has a real atmosphere to it with stylish brooding cinematography and dialogue that's one third noirspeak and two thirds teenage dirtymindedness. It never plays above or below its own maturity level at once broadly funny and fiendishly clever.It's also a showcase for a host of young actors who are likely to become the Steve Buscemis and Robert Downey Jr.'s of their generation. Reece Thompson is noteperfect as Bobby a classically straightlaced gumshoeintraining who can't seem to catch a break. He holds the movie on his back and shows some real star power. Taylor is hilarious as the airheaded president and Bobby's three stoner friends  Tanya Fischer Luke Grimes and Vincent Piazza  inject their scenes with a putupon camaraderie. Mischa Barton Adam Pally and Melonie Diaz also shine.The old pro's have a lot of fun with the material Willis Kathryn Morris and Michael Rapaport. Willis is particularly strong as the scenestealing principal. He's a deadly serious toughasnails man who can't stop talking about his tour of duty in the Gulf War  perhaps not the most appropriate coaching technique for a group of adolescents. His dialogue is spotless timing perfect and intensity  palpable. Every scene he appears in elevates the material to a heightened level of pulppop culture craziness you almost can't believe that's actually Bruce Willis standing there having so much fun almost impersonating himself. I'd go so far as to say Willis deserves a Supporting Actor nomination for his work here.It's an effective comedy and an interesting mystery. It has a lot of fun with its premise instead of sticking to it with an almost dutiful monogamy like Brick did. It's wellmade enough to make its director Brent Simon someone to watch out for. It's not perfect the conclusion lacks some umph but that only makes sense considering the film's last line Forget it Bobby it's High School. 810".

It grated on me to the point that I stopped caring. It not a good sign when I got up and walked out and left the DVD running.

Its clearly set up to seem like its hip and cool but to me it seemed forced and false perhaps it was done to cover the fact the film is derivative of other better school comedy dramas. It grated on me to the point that I stopped caring. It not a good sign when I got up and walked out and left the DVD running. I did come back and watch the film to the end but I never much cared.I'm probably not the audience for this film. If you think you might be give it a shot as for me I'll watch Heathers again.";

Instead of getting Bobby Funke acting like a hard boiled detective out to wade through an engrossing web of lies and deceit to solve a mystery we get a nerdy kid trying to get a summer internship and gets to fit in with the cool crowd. The failure of the film rests solely on rejecting the noir aesthetic and instead doing scenes with school dances and beer pong. Visually many of the noir staples are missing with no use of shadows pedestrian use of lightening and no camera angles. Noir is treated as nothing more than a plot device. Without high stakes it is quite hard to really become engrossed with the plot. Hanging in the balance is a summer internship that Bobby never seems to really care too much about and as a result it is hard to get worked up about the plot.Reece Thompson does a decent job as Bobby Funke any problems with the character are issues with the writing and not with the performance. There is a huge cast of characters and honestly most serve no purpose but to further the plot. There is no depth and doesn't even make very good use of high school stereotypes. The one that missed the mark the most is the principal played by Bruce Willis. He exists as the authority figure but is way over the top and is a one note joke as an exsoldier who is overly aggressive and keeps taking about his fighting experiences. The less said about Mischa Barton's weak attempt to play a femme fatale the better. A brief nude scene does not excuse this performance. An interesting premise ruined by poor writing and direction. If you have any interest in this film at all seek out Brick a film with a similar premise that succeeds in all ways where this film failed and is the far superior one for it.".

I mean there is tons of movies for a certain type of genre but you hardly see people whining about similar styles in films and go see it anyways. So Assassination of a High School President is it's own film as a matter of fact it would have worked as a fresh sequel for Brick. Now is it better than Brick? I don't think so. And if I had to compare it to Brick this is complicated but not as intelligent not as convoluted but also not that much in depth less heartbreaking but comedic. Also main character in this film just isn't cool or slick as Brendan from Brick but that could be his charm.

But when Paul's girlfriend who is the hottest girl in school makes a move on Bobby and even his former bullies lay off his back Funke begins to doubt the jock's guilt and everyone else's motives. And his investigation uncovers a campus wide conspiracy that threatens to take down people in high places in school. Funke must decide to either stay as the new stud on campus or decide to tell the truth although he is sort of forced to go with the other option. The build up was good but the ending wasn't that satisfying because it was simply far fetched had plot holes and just wasn't that creative but passable.7.410".

Funke must decide to either stay as the new stud on campus or decide to tell the truth although he is sort of forced to go with the other option. The build up was good but the ending wasn't that satisfying because it was simply far fetched had plot holes and just wasn't that creative but passable.7.410";

	schema:reviewBody "I'd been resisting watching this movie mainly because of Mischa Barton but thankfully a trailer for the movie convinced me otherwise or else I'd have missed this little gem.For me this movie was a neat satire of several types of movie settings. It's a mystery through and through but it satirizes styles such as 1940s detective noir prison dramas conspiracy theories and high school movies. And it does it well to a certain extent.The movie is not perfect it's not that well polished and I felt that some of the actors were a little to laid back but it's a little nitpick. The tone of the mystery was well maintain throughout with subplots and little twisters popping along to keep the movie going. Sure the mystery wasn't mysteryproof...you could guess where it was heading before it happened but it was still a fun ride. The performances were decent not brilliant but not over the top. Mischa Barton was the sole sore point she didn't really do anything with her bad girl character. Perhaps it may be because she wasn't given much screen time but in that case why have her. The movie wasn't going to be a must see for everyone in any case and any no name fledgling and better looking actress could have done an able job. Still I'm biased against her so I still maintain she sucked and brought the movie down a little.I'd still recommend this movie as it worth watching the mystery is great who stole the SAT sheets and it's fun watching Bobby Funke try to meander his way to the truth much like a roving ace reporter and there's never a dull moment.".

There was totally no reason for Bruce Willis to be in it and the storyline was pretty terrible. It just seemed like your usual American teenage college movie which we have seen loads of times before and it just seemed to drag. I was quite disappointed with the film and I can totally understand why it didn't make much noise even if Bruce Willis was in it. Expected Better!RoundUp With the murders happening in the schools I can totally understand why they held this movie back because I don't think that it would have gone down well with the victims relatives. The director didn't really use Bruce Willis that much so it's obvious that he plastered him all over the poster hoping to get people to see it but judging by the money that it took that didn't really work. The main character who is doing all of the investigating was a bit dull and I couldn't understand why he was left to solve the problem when an adult should have dealt with the matter.Budget 11.5million Bruce's Wage! Worldwide Gross  70000 Terrible!I recommend this movie to people who like there typical American teenage movies about college life. 210".

	schema:reviewBody "Assassination of a High School President is a mysterycomedy mishmash in which neither the mystery nor the comedy are really any good. The story unfolds in a high school where Bobby Funke writes for the paper. Except he's never actually finished a story. But he gets his big break when he's assigned to do an article on student body president Paul Moore. Then the school principal discovers the completed SATs have been stolen from his office. Intrepid reporter Bobby Funke is on the case. He ties Paul Moore to the crime and writes an article incriminating him pretty much ruining Paul's life. His sleuthing has earned Bobby newfound popularity amongst his classmates but he soon begins to have doubts. Was Paul really guilty? Or was he just a pawn in some sort of grand conspiracy? Bobby resumes sleuthing but unfortunately for the viewers nothing particularly interesting or funny happens while he does.Reece Thompson does a reasonably decent job with the role of Bobby but the script does him few favors especially with the way it uses Bobby as a narrator who narrates seemingly every second of the movie. This grows tiresome very quickly especially as much of the narration is meant to be funny but is not. Meanwhile the film's central mystery ends up not being very mysterious you'll figure the whole thing out long before Bobby does. The film's obviousness drains much of the drama away. And the film really struggles for momentum. The plot such as it is moves forward at glacial pace. Some scenes are absolutely interminable. Humor falls flat. Really the only guy to draw any laughs is Bruce Willis playing the quite strange principal. Willis has his moments injecting some life into the dull proceedings. Mischa Barton has a big role as the school's resident hot girl. The film tries to set her character up as some sort of femme fatale but neither the actress nor the character convinces. By the end rather than coming together the film pretty much unravels. You can see where the movie's going you don't like where it's going and you got very little entertainment out of it along the way. No way to spin this as anything other than a big disappointment.".

I was confused as to the time period. The music at the dance was modern and there was a bad reference to a cell phone but none of the kids have a cell phone. Once you get past the weirdness of the time period the movie settles down to a soso whodunit with twists the box tells you there are twists so they are expected. The first person narration throughout much of the movie got to be boring. I did enjoy the John Wilkes Booth limp of the assassin as well as the character of the school nurse. The Spanish teacher was supposed to be quirky but really was bland due to a bad script. I think the movie would have been better if they added another quirky teacher or two to the mix as background characters similar to the Spanish teacher.".

An all time great movie villain perhaps.Many fans forget about Stallone's solid output in the 90's Cliffhanger is always mentioned but Assassins seems to be forgotten. It's a slick and explosive action thriller from Lethal Weapon director Donner. Featuring some great dialog and shoot outs between Stallone and Banderas.On the negative side the film is too long. Running over 2 hours Assassins begins to wear out it's welcome. And the love story between Moore and Stallone is too cheesy and unrealistic to be taken seriously.Like Daylight and Copland Assassins is one of Stallone's most underrated films from the 90's.

Ironically enough in the advent of John Woo his american popularity and his imitators as well as Micheal Bay Tony Scott and Jerry Brukhiemer it is rephreshing to see an action movie a shootout action movie where the emphasis is on efficiency and control rather than chaos.  Unlike the John Woo pilosophy of keeping the guns firing non stop even if they hit nothing Assassins works on the exact opposite theory of every shot has a purpose and a meaning and no shot is taken wildly even to distract add on to the fact that in most John Woo movies and especially  Michael Bay movies the guns are super loud whereas in Assassins pretty much every shot thats fired is silenced. I beleive there is only one instance in the film where shots are fired wildly wnd wrecklessly and that is during the apartment scene where Antonio Banderas' character. Micheal Bein shoots blindly through a wall at Slyvester Stallone's character Robert Rath.  Other than that there is not really anytype of panic fire or wild bullet spraying in fact I dont beleive this film even features automatic rifles of any kind.  Strangely enough this allows for events that move extremly quick example the first scene featuring the three title characters in the hotel.  We see Antonio Banderas in the blink of an eye alomst take out 3 guards walkinto the room they were guarding and then take out the 4 targets in that room in the same amount of time.  In a way it is very similar to the old Samurai films since their action scenes moved in a similar manner with nothingn then all of a sudden a few quick sword strikes and the conflict is over.  That being said this movie would require a certain type of taste in action movies or is a type of movie you have to be in the mood to watch.sidenote When I first watched this film I had no idea it featured the would be superstar Antonio Banderas nor that it was written by the soon to be Matrix creators.  In that sense it is almost a fun movie to watch because it kinda answers the question what did they do before they were famous? and now you know.".

Robert Rath Stallone wanted to kill Bain so bad during this scene. I loved the explosions. I just had a thought though. Whenever Rath blew Bain out of the window and then it showed Bain in the bathtub shouldn't he have had more wounds than it showed? I don't know. Maybe it was just me. Anyways. This movie had violence but not as much as most movies in this genre does. I thought it had just enough. The ending was pretty good. It seemed like Bain just would not die. An invincible villain!

Not only does this movie possess comedy but it's thrilling. I was on the edge of my seat in some of the scenes. I honestly didn't know who to cheer for between Miguel Antonio Banderas and Robert Sylvester Stallone. I enjoy them both and both their characters were hitmen. Even though Robert was trying to go through a change he was still a hitman end of story. Now Miguel he was a little more cutthroat. In this story Robert is starting to grow a soft spot and only kills the person he was hired to kill...leaving innocents out of it. While Miguel was ready to shoot a 7year old soccer player to get what he wanted. Banderas plays this part well. I dunno if any of you caught this but when Banderas is handling a gun he does alot of the same things in movie. Scenes from the movie Desperado started to flash in my head when I saw Banderas and Stallone duking it out at the cemetary. Robert is then hired to hit a mark which is a woman who is only known by a pair of cat eyes to retrieve a disc and also kill the buyers. Miguel is also hired for the same job causing a little game between the 2 hitmen. Ofcourse Robert can't come around to killing Electra Julianne Moore so he instead protects her and later teams up with her for some more delightfully planned out fun. I really enjoyed this movie because I am the crime loving type. I also loved it because of the connection between Electra and Robert. A definate must see if you enjoy movies such as this. If you don't prefer them then go watch Aladdin.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a top notch action film with 2 awesome performances from Stallone and Banderas!. It's very unpredictable and a really cool twist at the end that you won't see coming!. I loved the mind games between Stallone and Banderas they were a LOT of fun to watch and see them try to outsmart each other was a treat!. It's very intelligent with only a few plot holes plus the chemistry between Stallone and JUlianne Moore was great!. It's One of Stallone's best Non Rocky films and one of his best performances too! even though he is amazing in everything!. The Directing is awesome!. Richard Donner does an awesome job here with some great camera work keeping the film fresh and overall keeping the film at VERY fast pace!. There is lots of blood but we only get LOTS of extremely bloody gunshot wounds. The Acting is AWESOME!. Sylvester Stallone is AMAZING as always he gives one of his best performances here he kicks that ass had awesome chemistry with Julianne Moore and was just TONS of fun to watch!. Antonio Banderas is AWESOME here as the main villain  he was extremely menacing funny and him and Stallone were great fun to watch! love his accent!. Julianne Moore is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS! and was GREAT here she had awesome chemistry with Stallone and was very smart she was a perfect choice to play this part! she is a wonderful actress!. Anatoli Davydov is good in his scene!. Overall GO see it! a must see!  out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have watched 'The Mechanic' you will certainly see a parallel between that movie  this movie. Both are fastpaced action movies about two assassins in conflict with each other.'The Mechanic' starred Charles Bronson in the lead role of a veteran contract hitman Arthur Bishop. He took on a cocky but ambitious young man Steve McKenna played by JanMichael Vincent to be his protg. The latter turned the table on the master.In this movie 'Assassins' Sylvester Stallone played the lead role of a veteran contract hitman Robert Bath who apparently was number one in the business. A cocky but ambitious young hitman Miguel Bain played by Antonio Banderas came into the scene with the fatalistic idea of becoming the number one.Intertwined in their personal conflict of hierarchy appeared a woman computer hacker Electra played by Julianne Moore as well as a mysterious employer Nikolai Taslinkov who seemingly was connected to all the three key characters in the movie.For the rest of the movie it was an exciting cat  mouse game between Bath  Bain with Electra eventually teaming up with Bath to elude from  deal with Bain. The action sequences throughout the movie especially the shootout inside a hotel in the first half  the shootout in an abandoned building in Mexico towards the end were really good.It was quite fun to watch Antonio Banderas playing the hotheaded crazy guy. He was really good as good as Sylvester Stallone who as typical  in most of his movies of this genre Nighthawks Cobra Judge Dredd Demolition Man... played the cool confident character...maybe a little stiff in some way. Julianne Moore a very accomplished British actress unfortunately had an understated role although she did her best.On the whole 'Assassins' has been an entertaining  never a dull moment  action movie to watch...especially when you can watch two assassins for the price of one!".

	schema:headline " Slick enjoyable manoymano action thriller!";
	schema:reviewBody "I had never been a huge fan of Sylvester Stallone in the 1980s. I find most of his 80s flicks unwatchable. He doesn't have that ability to let loose and make fun of himself while still entertaining like Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger. I can think of a dozen or so Arnie flicks from his career that I can just plain sit back and enjoy bc Arnie knew how to entertain an audience. Stallone has always taken himself too seriously and been too stiff. But guess what? A funny thing happened in the early 1990s. I started to like Sylvester Stallone! All of a sudden he made these hugely entertaining action flicks that his style of errr acting seemed to be suited for CLIFFHANGER THE SPECIALIST DAYLIGHT and this film my favorite of the lot ASSASSINS. I love ASSASSINS! I can watch it over and over. The tone pace and style of the film perfectly fits Stallone's stoic glaring steely demeanor. And Stallone is damn freakin good in this film! It's one of his better film performances. Stallone plays Robert Rath cool name a veteran highly paid assassin who will only assassinate highlevel shady criminals nicknamed marks. He has morals of course as noted early in the film. But Rath wants out. He's tired of killing for a living so he wants to do one last job assassinating a reclusive billionaire mark named Alan Branch who financed South American death squads.But there's a complication. Rath finds that he's no longer alone. A cocksure boisterous young gun named Miguel Bain played with vim vigor and verve by Antonio Banderas. Bain kills Branch at his brother's funeral where Rath was going to kill him then the fun begins! Rath tracks down Bain and tries to eliminate him but to no avail. Bain escapes and so Rath wants to know from his secret employer who this kid is. So Rath agrees to do one last job this time he's serious it pays 2 million dollars to retrieve a disc with encrypted information and kill the buyers and the seller the mark. The buyers are Interpol agents trying to capture Rath and Bain's secret employer. The mark who intercepted the transmission is a hot slightly skeweredinthebrain redheaded genius named Elektra and she is played by then newcomer and now top Hollywood actress Julianne Moore. I've never seen Moore's big time Oscarnominated movies except BOOGIE NIGHTS but I've seen her in a lot of other stuff and this is my favorite thing she's done.As Rath is about to complete this 'final' mission Bain steps in again and kills the buyers while Rath gets to Electra first before she turns over the disk information but decides not to kill her since Bain has interceded again and he wants to stop this kid and deal with his employer for hiring him by extorting for 20 million dollars for his trouble. It is during this time that Rath and Electra develop a connection and become partners to stop Bain from repeating history Rath killed the 1 assassin 15 years before to be 1 now Bain wants to kill Rath so he can become 1. Stallone Banderas and Moore are all excellent and keep the action lively and moving. I like the way the film shows how these highly trained professionals plot scheme think and outwit their way through sticky and tricky situations. The action is spare yet exciting when it comes and the film is an very interesting character study. It never slows down or drags at all even though the pace is delibarate. The final showdown is thrilling to say the least. Well done all the way around!".

There were just too many dumb things to let go the gun hidden in the cast at the funeral like that's not obvious Stallone's magic sandwich that he keeps taking bites out of but never chews or swallows hiding behind a gravestone in plain sight of the mobs of Day of the Dead people that somehow don't see them. Maybe I just took this too seriously? I enjoyed it more as it moved along I guess because the action picks up. Stallone does a decent enough job and I suppose he's meant to be some kind of antihero but that aspect never really comes through. A young Julianne Moore plays Electra who is a high tech hackercrazy cat ladyvoyeur. Weird.As for Antonio Banderas he's cccrazy but in a good way. Totally over the top and insane fun to watch cat and mouseing his way after Stallone. The ending climax is decent especially the bank scene with Antonio waiting all day to take Rath out and then the show down in the crumbling building. 21716".

The action sequences are excellently handled highly realistic and at the same time very exciting and the various special effects and stunts are inserted perfectly into the flow of things.Meanwhile the scenes of suspense between the action are full of very real danger so despite the long running time you never find your attention wavering. Cast in the flawed hero mould is endlesslycriticised Sylvestor Stallone putting in a nicely subtle performance and letting his nemesis Antonio Banderas do all of the overacting as psychotic but deadly assassin Miguel Bain. Holding the movie together is a lowkey and sweet Julianne Moore as a surveillance expert who finds herself over her head and in the middle of a violent battle to the death between two expert marksmen. The only problem I have with a film like this is that all other action movies don't possess the same level of commitment grace and intelligence as this one does.".

Cast in the flawed hero mould is endlesslycriticised Sylvestor Stallone putting in a nicely subtle performance and letting his nemesis Antonio Banderas do all of the overacting as psychotic but deadly assassin Miguel Bain. Holding the movie together is a lowkey and sweet Julianne Moore as a surveillance expert who finds herself over her head and in the middle of a violent battle to the death between two expert marksmen. The only problem I have with a film like this is that all other action movies don't possess the same level of commitment grace and intelligence as this one does.";

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1995 Richard Donner's Assassins is a slick action flick starring Sylvester Stallone as Rath a professional hit man who wants out of the business after decades of killing. Antonio Banderas plays his young rival and Julianne Moore a computer whiz with whom Rath teams up. Anatoli Davydov is also on hand.At a 132 minutes Assassins is too long for what it is  a walltowall action movie where someone gets shot every 12 minutes at least during the numerous ultraviolent sequences. This would be alright if the story and characters were interesting enough to warrant such length but they're not. Banderas shines in the role of Bain the zealous murderous psycho but being a murderous psycho means he will get no sympathy from the viewer otherwise he wouldn't be a murderous psycho. The characters played by Stallone and Moore are more sympathetic but there's not enough detail to really care about them. Beyond that the plot is convoluted even while the film is snappy. Despite the thrills the story's just not engrossing enough to give a higher grade but it's nowhere near as bad in this regard as say The Mummy Returns. In other words Assassins moderately keeps your attention.And then there's the pileup of implausibilities that are too easy to spot like how does Bain not get seriously wounded by a bus while hanging out the window of a taxi? How does he emerge virtually unscathed from a fall from a thirdstory window after a great explosion? Even if the table protected his head and midsection what about his fingers and legs that weren't protected? How did he NOT break something from the awkward fall? Why does Rath blow valuable seconds looking for a dumpster to throw a suitcase with a ticking bomb? If you knew a sniper was waiting for you outside a bank wouldn't you use the back door and then maybe surprise the assassin from behind? If someone pulls a gun on you like at the end with Bain and Rath wouldn't you automatically shoot first and ask questions later? Lastly the whole setup at the end with one character waiting in the bank another as a sniper in an abandoned hotel and the other outside informing the one in the bank is the height of contrived.I realize implausible and contrived things happen in all action flicks but the really good ones are able to get away with it because the filmmakers take the extra time to work out the kinks and make a truly compelling picture like Terminator 2 and not merely string together a bunch of exciting action scenes with contrivances galore. Still Assassins is worth checking out if you like the cast and are in the mood for a polished actionthriller.The film was shot in Seattle  Everett Washington Portland Oregon and San Juan Puerto Rico.GRADE C".

True Richard Donner lacks the style of those great directors but it's that kind of situation and Donner milks it for all its delicious tension through to the satisfying if not entirely surprising resolution.Sure Assassins isn't exactly cinema at its finest. But it delivers what it promises some clever action that for once takes the time to evolve from the characters  no doubt courtesy of the Wachowski Brothers' aboveaverage script. I'd put Assassins right up alongside some of Stallone's other underrated action flicks  well ahead of simpler films like The Specialist and Cliffhanger and even smidgen ahead of the more robust Daylight.Don't go in expecting Citizen Kane and you should have have a grininducing good time with this one.".

Julianne Moore gives a good performance as the love interest to Stallone's character. She performs the role with emotion and does a respectable job of it. Now when I watched this film recently all I thought of was how amazing Antonio Banderas performed his role as the archnemesis of Stallone's character. Banderas did an excellent job on his character he performed it with depth emotion and wit. His performance was convincing and made the movie that much better for me. He was the star of the movie even though he wasn't meant to be the star of the movie. He out acts Stallone and Moore he makes the movie what it is with his memorable performance as Bain it reminds me very much of how Heath Ledger was a key to the success of the Dark Knight. Banderas was key the the movies success but overall it was a good movie with great characters. And great performances from a star cast.".

But  I got a surprise.Stallone plays a hitman. He's the maestro. Long in the business and meticulously careful with a low profile. But he's had about enough and wants out. His contracts come via the internet that's not something you could do post 911. At his next hit he finds himself upstaged by another killer played by Antonio Banderas. He's also extremely good at killing but he's halfway over the blue wall slaughtering anyone who is the least inconvenience with a maniacal relish. He's the new kid on the block and wants to be No1. But it's obvious that such overt ferocious excess couldn't possibly stand the test of time. The authorities would have to track him down. A star that burns twice as bright shines for half as long etc.It appears that both men have been playedoff by their contractor. One of Stallone's next hits is a female computerhacker who sells secrets to foreigners  a traitor in other words.Instead of bumping her off he's an unemancipated sucker you see he decides to defend her from his heirpresumptive firebrand who is likewise after her scalp. What follows then often resembles 'The Terminator' where hero Kyle Reece tries to keep Sarah Connor safe from the relentless cyborg. Though there are other plot threads too.I found this a thoroughly entertaining romp. It far exceeded my expectations. Sly's sluggish demeanour is well suited to the quiet calculating character he plays. Whilst Antonio Banderas has played the manic pistolero often enough to know the score. All the players give a decent turn for their paycheques. When the action comes  it comes plentiful and fast. Meanwhile the corpses accumulate. But it's not all roadrage and shoot'emup. There are plenty of mood moments and lots of clever original plot details. I particularly like the exchanges of money and goods by means of a radiocontrolled model truck via the hotel ventilation ducts.All of the technical issues like lighting and editing are on the mark. The soundtrack and incidental music are interesting and wellchosen. I was only a little disappointed by the ending. This movie has far more to engage the viewer than Tom Cruise's verbose and rather overblown 'Collateral' which also features a hero protecting some female from Cruise's brutal assassin. Frankly I think the critics have been unreasonably harsh there's some solid entertainment here. Recommended.".

	schema:headline " Worse than I ever could have imagined.";
	schema:reviewBody "This could be the worst movie ever made. Certainly its the worst I've seen in a very long time. Now before I begin I have to say that I'm not a fan of the series to begin with. It had its moments but as a lifelong resident of Manhattan I mostly blamed the series for the unbearable influx of wideeyed moronic girls from all over the country who flocked to the city en masse thinking that upon arrival their lives would instantly revolve around cosmopolitans rich men and 1000 shoes and who very quickly became insufferable basket cases once the reality of city life actually set in on them. Of course I saw this movie with my girlfriend as my good deed for the week. What I was not prepared for was how horrible it actually was. The first ten minutes contained more clich stinted dialog corny jokes and general awkwardness than I had previously thought possible in such a short time frame. It was embarrassing. It also involved Liza Minelli. I thought it couldn't get worse but oh did it ever. Next came the foundation for the entire film which was that the ladies were in a funk and needed to get away for a couple of weeks. The funny thing about that is how they all have impossibly great lives especially by NYC standards. They live in massive apartments have highpaying careers plenty of money and for everyone but Samantha loving husbands and families. And its not like there was some substantial existential crisis underpinning their dissatisfaction to legitimize their feelings and generate sympathy on behalf of the audience. It all amounted to 'Boohoooo we used to partyyyy all the time but now we're all grownups waaa pity us'. Literally that was it. Sorry I don't feel bad for you guys. So Carrie starts a whole big fight with her husband because he doesn't feel like going out to some stupid party after working into the evening and providing her with a lifestyle that includes what appears to be a 15 million apartment two luxury cars an unlimited decorating budget a truly massive closet with hundreds of thousands of dollars in clothes enough leisure time to write her stupid books AND her old apartment to write them in. Then he had the NERVE to not buy her jewelry for their anniversary she actually said that. It was completely effing nauseating.The rest of the women's 'problems' were no better. Charlotte has kids who drive her crazy. Really groundbreaking stuff there. Especially since she too lives in a multimillion dollar apartment with a full time livein nanny and housekeeper. Pathetic. Miranda has a new boss who doesn't like her very much OBVIOUSLY because she's a woman duh. There's no other reason for a boss to not like a subordinate other than their gender clearly. And finally Samantha is old and needs to take hormones for menopause now stop the presses. Is your heart bleeding for them yet? No? You must hate women you sexist. Moving right along. Samantha somehow is a megaPR agent at this point in Times Square?? despite the fact that I've literally never seen her do any work resembling PR and I know lots of PR people. She meets some sheik at a party who simply MUST have her work that imaginary PR magic on behalf of his new hotel and as a perk of this great new account conveniently gets the girls invited to Abu Dhabi. Hooray! Their dreary despair comes to an end as they're flown ultrafirstclass to the glamorous 'new' middleeast shuttled to the luxury hotel in individual Maybach limousines one for each of them! and given two weeks allexpensespaid in the hotel's premier 22000night penthouse suite because that is totally standard treatment for PR flacks. Naturally. All is well in this paradise for like a week until the icky middleeastern customs of female oppression begin to rear their ugly head and Samantha is inevitably arrested for being a giant whore and having sex on the beach with some Dutch dude at which point they're politely informed that Samantha's PR expertise would not be needed after all and that they'd be personally responsible for another night of hotel charges unless they vacated the hotel in one hour. So now these four extremely wealthy women proceed to freak the hell out because if they don't hurry they may be liable for gasp! 5500 each to cover the suite. Makes perfect sense to me too. Never mind that they're millionaires particularly Carrie whose couch alone in her living room is worth upwards of 30000. Never mind that they could have also asked to be moved into regular rooms for the night so they could leave at a normal pace the next day. But on the other hand if they had been logical we wouldn't have been treated to a madcap scene of the girls packing and then inexplicably getting into trouble at the local bazaar again related to Samantha's inability to keep her clothes on followed by a quasiinsulting scene of burqaclad women revealing designer clothes under their robes and reading a Susanne Sommers menopause book for some reason. Ultimately they make their way to the airport in a horrible little gypsy cab because between the four of them they couldn't afford a limo of their own too? and before you know it they're off to America again. Oh and Carrie hooked up with her ex boyfriend at some point in there and told her husband about it for no good reason. Predictably they get home and everyone is as introspective as they're capable of not very much at all and they realize how wonderful their lives really are no they don't. The end.Now you don't need to see the movie. You're welcome.".

With the recession the loss of jobs and general pessimism of late  the thought of dressing up drinking cocktails and watching a great movie in the company of a whole room full of women like us was excellent. We desperately wanted to love the movie.Initially everyone seemed to be in good form  a bit of a cheer when Mr. Big came on screen gasps and giggles in response to the first few jokes.then uncomfortable silence. My sister squirmed in the seat beside me through the horrible 'I am woman' song. Having visited the Middle East myself and enjoyed the cultural experience and friendly people albeit with a different outlook on life I was pretty appalled at the blatant lack of propriety exercised by the four.I have to admit when the movie ended all the women around me turned to each other and said it was 'great'  I don't think we were ready to admit that it was possibly the biggest disappointment ever. My sister and I had planned to talk about the outfits and scenarios afterwe completely avoided the topic. We had all looked forward to this movie  we couldn't admit to ourselves never mind anyone else that it was awful.To say I loved the original show is an understatement. As I enter my late twentiesearly thirties the reruns are even more relevant. The characters in the show discussed sexuality in a fresh exciting way. They were women you could look up to  intelligent confident selfassured. They bear zero resemblance to the four selfindulgent disrespectful two dimensional creatures I had to watch.I doubt any fan will take my advice and not go  I would have ignored it myself. The movie seems to symbolise everything that has gone wrong lately  by blindly pursuing materialism we lose what's really important. This movie spells that out  and leaves you feeling ashamed for having loved them so much in the first place. Having said that I watched an episode in the series a night later and realised that actually I'm not an idiot  they used to discuss interesting relevant issues  just in fabulous clothes.As an aside I spent an hour with my sister getting all dressed up to go two hours chatting to her before we watched the horror show and four hours after dancing our socks off. Maybe the fact that was the best part means I have my priorities right after all.".

That was bad. This one...even worse. The characters have become utterly superficial materialistic in a way that's practically nauseating given the current state of the economy  and completely 2 dimensional. The writing  cartoony and juvenile. Honestly Carrie's the worst  the way the character acted in the film I would personally have recommended that Mr. Big file for divorce. Complaining because he wants to stay home and watch movies together then forcing him to leave a partythat she dragged him toearly because he had a conversation with another woman? Jeez.As for Samantha  that character's gone completely over the top  sex crazed in a way that went way past racy and into plain vulgar. Combine that with the incongruity of throwing the characters into a completely unrealistic situation heading to Abu Dahbi? and then disrespect that they show to Arab culture....well this movie COULD NOT have been worse. Thank goodness that there's no way they'll make STC3. At least I really really hope not. How this ever could have been green lighted for production is totally beyond my comprehension.".

Who acts like Samantha when in a foreign country the Middle East or otherwise? As I watched the characters make total asses of themselves I was embarrassed for them simply sitting in the theater. It's no wonder other countries believe Americans lack respect for everyone and everything. Hollywood apparently does and wants everyone to know it.

Not only Samantha also looks much older than she is thanks to the terrible makeup but her behavior is erratic and really not consistent with what has been shown in the series.

	schema:headline " The Good and The Bad";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the first Sex and the City movie and finding it OKAY I decided to take a stab at the second film. I am a huge fan of the HBO series so i was naturally excited...THE GOOD Yes there were some funny moments and some nice things to look at clothes design men. I liked most of the music choices and I did enjoy the first 20 minutes or so of the film because it seemed as though it would be building up to something interesting but just these few things alone could not have made a good enough movie for one of the best shows to ever air on television. THE BAD This movie had a lot of downfalls. Lets start with the plot or lack there of. The audience was treated to four women that constantly complained about their problems. I am not saying that their issues were not legitimate to regular women but they did not present these issues in a way that would create an interesting plot..they were just seemingly simple problems that were over dramatized and annoying to listen to lackluster marriage boring job declining hormones having children... In the middle of these problems we get to see how rich they are with their maidsnannys change of expensive clothes every 4 minutes and fancy homes. All these things made it hard to sympathize with them.

I felt as though there was a mocking undermining quality to the way they portrayed middle eastern customs... But more importantly to me is the fact that when i think of the show and its title Sex in the CITY I think of that city as NYC NOT Abu Dhabi really what were they thinking?

	onyx:emotionText "After seeing the first Sex and the City movie and finding it OKAY I decided to take a stab at the second film. I am a huge fan of the HBO series so i was naturally excited...THE GOOD Yes there were some funny moments and some nice things to look at clothes design men. I liked most of the music choices and I did enjoy the first 20 minutes or so of the film because it seemed as though it would be building up to something interesting but just these few things alone could not have made a good enough movie for one of the best shows to ever air on television. THE BAD This movie had a lot of downfalls. Lets start with the plot or lack there of. The audience was treated to four women that constantly complained about their problems. I am not saying that their issues were not legitimate to regular women but they did not present these issues in a way that would create an interesting plot..they were just seemingly simple problems that were over dramatized and annoying to listen to lackluster marriage boring job declining hormones having children... In the middle of these problems we get to see how rich they are with their maidsnannys change of expensive clothes every 4 minutes and fancy homes. All these things made it hard to sympathize with them.

Charlotte complaining about how hard it is to be her when she has a nanny AND a housekeeper. Miranda complaining that her boss doesn't like her. Carrie complaining that Big puts a TV in the bedroom. Samantha complaining about her hormones. I just kept thinking are you kidding me?? This passes for dialogue??. That's all in the first 8 minutes and it's just downhill from there.

The writer of these shallow and futile adventures of four dysfunctional Americans in Abu Dhabi seems to have the mind of a thirteen yearold boy with stupid jokes and lowlevel dialogs.

Sarah Jessica Parker lost her charming style and now looks like an anorexic with bad taste wearing dreadful clothing. Her infantile behavior after kissing her exboyfriend is probably the most ridiculous moment of the story for a forty and something years old woman. Kim Cattrall's character Samantha deserves pity for her attempt to behave like nymphomaniac lowlife slut.

	schema:reviewBody "The popular TV series Sex and the City has ran from 1998  2004 spawned a movie adaptation of the series in 2008 and here's the sequel that will most likely bring it to a close in 2010. At this point the girls are old enough for fans to not care what happens to them. But we keep coming back to see them every movie and every episode. We're so used to these characters we need them in our lives supposedly but after this movie my love for this show is drastically decreased. My hope for this film to be a successful follow up was brought to a tease when watching the first hour of this film.To begin with the film has a miserable run time. Two hours and thirty minutes may work for a superhero film or LOTR prequel but who the hell thought it would work for a Comedy about four women? The first film had the almost the same run time though it was entertaining and it was fun to see the characters do what they did in the second film like struggle with wedding plans and try on dresses. This is jam packed with racist stereotypical jokes about homosexuals Jewish people and Middle Eastern people as well. I'm sure if Prince of Persia didn't steal the subtitle The Sands of Time it would belong as the subtitle of SATC2.The plot is all four women are struggling with their marriages. Carrie Parker wants more sparkle with her man Big Charlotte Davis has trouble keeping her two children under control and frets the nanny Eve is getting too close to her husband Miranda Nixon is stressed with work and not there for her kid when she needs to be and Samantha Cattrall is still sleeping with the whole town. All knowing their stressed Samantha books a vacation for the girls to fly in n extreme first class condition to the Middle East where jokes take the route for stereotypical and the lackluster level plummets straight into the ground.Its sad to see a once brilliant series take the route of crap but if it were to keep going on and maintain the same jokes as seen in this it's better off dead. I said before the first movie was just as long but interesting to see the characters get into fun mischief and have fun intelligent talks. In this sequel an intelligent and interesting talk is hard to come by. Every talk is followed by some bad joke or stupid sexual comment no talk is perfect in this film.Overall the film is mediocre and just a bore. There are some humorous scenes by Carrie and Big but with a big name like Sex and the City it should've been extraordinary and have been on many critics Best of the year list. Instead it makes the Worst of the year list and probably will earn the title The worst film of the year by most critics. Wouldn't surprise me if the cameo by Miley Cyrus is nominated for a Razzie Award. Lord knows the film will be too.Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall Kristin Davis Cynthia Nixon Alice Eve Chris Noth John Corbett David Eigenberg Evan Handler Miley Cyrus Penelope Cruz Jason Lewis Lynn Cohen and Liza Minnelli.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm an English person of no religious faith at all but the way this film treats Islamic culture is so deeply offensive I literally couldn't watch at points. The four characters we have learnt to love over the series are made to be characters I literally despise in this hideously misguided sequel. They come across as ignorant brash and horrible tourists who flagrantly disregard Islamic modesty laws while on holiday in Abu Dhabi and show little respect or courtesy in a foreign land. The scene where Samantha goes insane and starts throwing condoms at braying men is particularly embarrassing followed by the girls rescue by a group of women in burkhas who then whip them off to reveal designer clothes beneath. The film doesn't set to dispel any myths about Middle Eastern culture instead it actively enforces these stereotypes and makes them seem laughable and stupid and worse encourages them to be disregarded and mocked by Western audiences. We are never given a sense of what Aby Dhabi is actually like like stupid American tourists the girls spend little time outside of their luxury five star hotel and when they do eventually leave the Moroccan souk they visit couldn't look more like a studio set if it tried. The girls walk around with bare arms and legs as if this would have no repercussions in an Islamic country the sad reality is this behaviour would see them swamped with lecherous men as happened to my friends during a visit to Morocco.What makes everything worse is the way the characters have been turned into grotesque parodies of their formers selves. Before the love of clothes of materialism was balanced by a sense of friendship now the girls have simply become rich ungrateful moaning middle aged annoyances. Their gratuitous love of wealth is pathetic and stupid and the comparison of Carrie having to spend time away from Big when directly compared to an Indian hotel worker being forced to spend time away from his wife is insensitive. Charlotte struggling to look after two children when she is a stay at home mum with a full time nanny is also extremely insensitive seeing as she has it so easy.A horrible film that ruined the heartfelt and intelligent series. Complete and utter horror was my only reaction.".

At least his present was from the heart since the story behind it was that he enjoyed watching an old movie with her the other day. To be honest Big is usually not the kind of character I would ever see settling down and being controlled by a woman so to me he did an awesome job. I mean after a long day at work he decides to make Carrie happy and go with her to a movie premiere. I mean c'mon this guy is doing everything to make her happy. And what does she do? Complains all the time and then cheats on him with Aidan in a foreign country. This movie made me hate Carrie the whole time I kept thinking she was acting like a spoiled 16 year old. At no point did she stop to think. I meaneven though she was never perfect in the series she was someone who would stop and ask herself rhetorical questions every five minutes. For someone with so much experience in relationships she was so stupid. The other characters were also equally dumb Miranda was maybe the only one that was still half normal.All in all I just wish the producers of this film would have stayed true to the characters and focused on what really mattered instead of trying to impress us with a bunch of superficial things which in the end made everything in the movie look shallow.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a rare breed...a heterosexual male who enjoyed Sex and the City on HBO. This movie on the other hand...I'll sum it up with the word stinks.There are plenty of problems I have with the finished product. First off the movie is set in Abu Dhabi...a location where most of the audience couldn't find on a map if they were given a flashlighthat a magnifying glass and a clue! And by the way movie producers the showmovie is called Sex AND the City. And that city is NEW YORK clowns! Half of the identity and allure of the show is that it is set in New York. This sequel being set in Abu Dhabi would be like making a sequel to Waterworld and setting it in the Sahara desert! What an absolutely utter moronic decision to cast it in Abu Dhabi. Who greenlights these types of decisions...and is there any way to have those people rounded up and savagely killed in a public setting?! Secondly and trust me I'm completely aware that Hollywood is going to milk this cow completely dry...but the basis of the TV series was the trials and tribulations of 4 middleaged women trying to find their way in relationships and in life. That type of show inevitably brings a best by date along with it though. And that date has clearly passed. The show now resembles 3 rich and snobby abovemiddleaged women...and their Grandma. People get old. Plots excluding cartoons and superheroes get stale. It's inevitable. No need to trounce around a 53yearold Kim Cattrall spouting cringeworthy lines that no 50plusyearold women would ever utter! Example After meeting a welltodo Arab man Cattrall announces He's the 'Lawrence of my labia'! Ouch. I had to pause and take a shower after writing that line! There's bad puns and there's bad puns...but that one takes the cake! A common theme from the general public in regards to the show...which is understandably getting louder and louder over the years...is the question of Are there any humans on Earth that actually behave in this manner?! You've got one girl Cattrell who's such a slut she puts a drunk and cokedout Lindsay Lohan to shame! With her sexual past I wouldn't touch her with a hazmat suit on! Kristen Davis manipulates more partners than Glenn Beck does viewers. And Sarah Jessica Parker  her love interest is nicknamed Big. If that's not a slut for you  nicknaming your boyfriend based on his member  I don't know what is! I don't know any guys who would actually date any of these girls. They are highmaintenance petty golddigging partnerjumping manipulating whores with apparent mental issues.And what's up with the running time?! 212 hours for a show about sex gossip and relationships?! This isn't Schindler's List material you know! Liza Minnelli makes an appearance for comic relief...with the exception that she didn't really bring any comedy. Doing the whole laughattheoldlady routine isn't that bright considering your cast is all 40 or 50 aged females. Just horrible.Trust me it's awful.Thank you for reading! JD".

The variety published by a typical paper can usually be solved in less than 5 minutes or at least that's been my experience with them. The goal for me was to grab an issue of The Kansan take a seat in class and have the Sudoku finished before learning was to commence. I didn't have class every day so when I didn't need the Sudoku I kept the paper. A small pile sits next to me as I type this review. I never got to working a single puzzle after graduating I found that writing and talking about movies was a more suitable exercise for me. It seems that the worse the movie in question the more mistakes there are to find. For that reason alone Sex and the City 2 is a good brain teaser.The adventure begins when Carrie Preston Sarah Jessica Parker and friends Miranda Cynthia Nixon Charlotte Kristin Davis and Samantha Kim Cattrall attending the wedding of their best gay friends. Since this is based on a long running TV series I'm sure fans of the show found more significance to the scene than I did. In my eyes it was the most logical way to present Liza Minnelli as herself singing Beyonc's Single Ladies. It's a scene that can't be unseen and I knew instantly that it would haunt me for the rest of the summer. Everyone at the wedding makes Carrie feel bored with her life now that she's settled down with Mr. Big Chris Noth. The most bizarre way this is accomplished is by having a random couple tell them they will be lonely if they don't have children. Then wouldn't you know it something ridiculous happens and the girls get flown to Abu Dhabi where they are treated like royalty all because some sheik wants Samantha work a PR campaign for his property. But don't worry our leading ladies forget about any logical objective and proceed to flaunt what they got in the desert.I realize this movie didn't have me in mind when it was created. This is my first experience with the girls of Sex and the City and from what I gathered I can see why an hourlong TV program running on premium cable would be a hit. These girls are rude and vulgar but they play off of each other like champs. When they are seated at a table gossiping is when Sex and the City 2 shows any hint of a shine. The problems then smudge that polish.I've never seen so many costume changes. I'm convinced it's the driving point behind the narrative. Every scene is constructed to show what Carrie and the girls can put on then lead to another situation for them to dress up. No movie should be so shallow and even worse they look flammable and toxic. I wasn't sure if the running gag is that Carrie doesn't know she looks like a low rent streetwalker there's a sign of trouble if ever there was one.No care is shown with the characters. Samantha sleeps with absolutely any guy regardless of the situation and the outcome is too much to stomach. Miranda has a subplot about needing to balance work and family which gets lost in a sea of plunging necklines. Charlotte frets about her husband cheating on her with their nanny every 10 minutes. Lastly Carrie is simply too selfish to be likable. She has a husband who seems to be doing a fantastic job by everyone else's standards. To her he needs to do more and this sets her up for a lamebrain and oddly predictable encounter with an old flame.The wanton excess of this movie leaves no doubt as to why the world hates us. Sex and the City 2 is a better terrorist motivational tool than it is an enjoyable time at the theatre. These girls are easily living the life in New York before the film takes its sweet time to send them to the Middle East where everything is ratcheted up to 11. They each get a personal Maybach 62 S so they can be chaffered to and from locations where they can offend locals and change clothes. There's an occasionally clever line but that won't vindicate watching it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't even know where to begin because this movie is so awful but let's start with the plot shall we? Carrie and Co. are so exhausted from their spoiled lives that they decide to have a girls vacation all expense paid of course by way of Samantha's business agenda. Where does this vacation take place? Why the only place where girls aren't allowed to show an ounce of skin speak without permission and wear burka's AKA the Middle East.There the ladies insist on acting like spoiled brats which they can't help considering that's exactly what they are. But let's consider what makes these women want to take a vacation.1. Carrie is getting away from her terrible husband of 2 years who buys her TV's instead of jewelry wants to come home and relax after a hard day while she wants to party like she's 20 instead of 45 eat Chinese food rather than go to some pricey restaurant and lets her keep her apartment in order for her to get away from the pressures of her horrible life. Oh and he's so horrible that he decides to make her happy and go out anyway even though he's tired.2. Samantha is aching for some new male attention after sleeping with the entire east coast and looking to expand her clientle the one that pays for her services with actual cash rather than nature's credit card.3. Miranda needs to get away from her loving attentive and adoring husband and their child that she never sees her boss who is sexist of course her terrible job that pays for her wonderful home and her terrible nanny that takes care of her sick mother in law child and the house.4. Ah Charlotte. We all know she's had it very rough over the past eight years in the course of the series and these 2 movies her never ending trust fund her Upper East Side or one of those fancy places apartment her perfect husband that loves her more than the air he breathes her two children that she wanted more than anything and of course her full time live in nanny. After a breakdown from having so much stress of this terrible life while baking cookies Charlotte decides that her life is just too stressful with a perfect husband full time nanny and all the time to herself to drink with her friends.Yes indeed these women have it ROUGH. I'm surprised they haven't complained to the government about the unfair turn of events their lives have taken. How dare those husbands give them everything and love them so much! How dare those hardworking husbands want to relax instead of reliving their youth! To alleviate their dreadful lives they go to Abu Dabhi...because that's the Las Vegas section of the Middle East you see. Only it's not.Their perfect vacation goes awry when they learn that skimpy outfits particularly midriff baring tops and fluffy skirts aren't considered cute especially on a middle aged woman. And who knew that having sex in public was against the law? Apparently not Samantha  she thought it was oppressive and sexist. So what does she do? She wears tiny outfits and yells I HAVE SEX! in the middle of a market place while humping the air.I know I know. Classy.In the end the ladies are kicked out for the lack of respect for another culture. Shocker right there. Oh! But not before Carrie conveniently runs into Aiden and kisses him because we all know that she needs drama to survive we have six seasons and another movie as evidence. However that lapse of judgment could be because she had an argument which Charlotte about something.Now this is the point where Miranda and Charlotte have a toast and bitch about their horrible lives with those pesty full time nannies. Keep in mind that Charlotte has no job and doesn't need one.Samantha of course is trying to give a guy  who she barely knows  a hand job in the middle of dinner. She's then arrested and that brings us to when the girls are kicked out and Sam has her meltdown in the middle of a marketplace.Somewhere between the bitching and non needed drama and the boredom is a lot of clothes changing that remind me why middle aged women should stop wearing clothes made for 20 yr olds.I was a fan of the series although looking at it now I'm not even sure why I am. The characters are selfish materialistic and spoiled this film amplifies those characteristics to the point where I am genuinely embarrassed for the cast and crew of this...thing.Are we supposed to feel sorry for these characters or something? Because all I felt was absolute disgust. These women have everything full time nannies husbands who love and worship them wardrobes that cost more than a house houses that cost more than country jobs that earn them more in one week than I do in a year and children who love them.No wonder why foreigners have such a bad opinion of Americans! These women are so disrespectful and it's infuriating to see. How could anyone even be allowed to produce such a stupid movie? I'm not even talking about the so over the top even Liberace would be embarrassed gay wedding and a random but painful rendition of Single Ladies by Liza Minnelli seriously what is this? The We pity over 40 yr old women movie?.Just...bad. It's almost traumatic to see.".

She's then arrested and that brings us to when the girls are kicked out and Sam has her meltdown in the middle of a marketplace.Somewhere between the bitching and non needed drama and the boredom is a lot of clothes changing that remind me why middle aged women should stop wearing clothes made for 20 yr olds.I was a fan of the series although looking at it now I'm not even sure why I am. The characters are selfish materialistic and spoiled this film amplifies those characteristics to the point where I am genuinely embarrassed for the cast and crew of this...thing.Are we supposed to feel sorry for these characters or something? Because all I felt was absolute disgust. These women have everything full time nannies husbands who love and worship them wardrobes that cost more than a house houses that cost more than country jobs that earn them more in one week than I do in a year and children who love them.No wonder why foreigners have such a bad opinion of Americans! These women are so disrespectful and it's infuriating to see. How could anyone even be allowed to produce such a stupid movie? I'm not even talking about the so over the top even Liberace would be embarrassed gay wedding and a random but painful rendition of Single Ladies by Liza Minnelli seriously what is this? The We pity over 40 yr old women movie?.Just...bad. It's almost traumatic to see.";

This movie from the terrible beginning to the God awful end shouldn't even be shown under the guise of a film. First of all I enjoyed the television show. The comradery is endearing and all women dream of a perfect life with perfect friends lots of money men that love them amazing clothes movie star friends red carpet premiers etc etc. SATC has created this dream into a likable series that most women enjoy. Now turning any series into a film is tricky 30 minute stories every week isn't really in depth story telling. Venturing into this realm the first time was ballsy but the second time around was simply egotistical. The film contains a various stories all hoping to appeal to its mostly female audience 1 Husband and wife fight over the TV wife wants to go out husband doesn't. Carrie wants to go to the premier Big wants to stay in and watch TV very relatable matter to most women right? 2Menopause seen as a chastity belt by someone like Samantha. She is taking any known medical serum hoping to prevent the inevitable. Aiming to guarantee her worn out body the ability to be enjoyed by the other half of Manhattan she hasn't already banged. 3Not enough time with family job too time consuming....yes I know...you are trying to grasp how women with money maids and nannies deal with such trying issues but I haven't told you the final story line...4A stay at home uber wealthy mother with a live in nanny is trying to deal with being a mother!!! Are you on the floor? That one should've put you right over the edge. So here we are four extremely wealthy women dealing with problems that you and I deal with every day. Except they have live in nannies drivers extra homes to hang out at when they want to get away closets full of couture and oh yeah did I mention they're millionaires? So how much crazier can this story get you ask well here it is the writersdirectors decided to throw these women into a culture that is the total opposite of everything they stand forTHE MIDDLE EAST..gasp hand over mouth tears streaming down your horrified face. So they send these spoiled sluts on over to the Middle East now this is where the story literally takes a nose dive into the Red Sea. The writersdirectors thought it would be humorous to have these women confronted with a culture so unlike their own and then have them mock it very ignorantly I might add. If there is ever the stereotypical view that Americans are stupid and ignorant to foreign cultures that assumption would have been reached upon viewing this film. The SATC sluts dress provocatively then mock the local women for choosing a life of piousness to one of shallow days filled with shopping. The culminating shot was Samantha's purse being spilled onto the streets of a marketplace and her stack of condoms falling out. She then screams into the crowd that yes she likes to have sex all while gyrating her hips and pumping her fists. Are we to assume that the writerdirectors were hoping that you would side with Samantha? Hooray for America for women having sex wearing whatever they want and being proud of it? Not that there is anything wrong with that but they are placing the Muslim lifestyle under the DON'T column of this list. Upon picking up her stack of condoms the women are helped by a group of Muslim women that take them to a back room and pull of there niqab's to reveal they are all dressed to the nines like the SATC ladies!! Hooray this culture of women dressed so terribly but underneath they want to be just like us Americans. Heartwarming right? Well it's not it is terribly arrogant and embarrassing. I feel there is always something good that comes from most movies good looking guysgirls cool clothes btwthe women were all dressed terribly in SATC2 some humorous dialogue but this movie has nothing. If there is a God then this movie will surely end up in hell.".

I wonder how much the Emirates Tourism Board offered the filmmakers for each time this occurred? If you Google Sex and The City 2 and crossreference the term product placement you will find over a thousand results. It seems I am not the only one who thought I was watching a 2.5 hour infomercial. Before the movie had begun I'd already suffered a million commercials for the usual chick products adverts for Chocolate when you're feeling ugly and adverts for beauty products to fix up the damage done by the chocolate. However when a movie fades in I expect the advertising to stop. Brandchannel.com called SATC2 a brandapalooza. The sequel even beat the first movie's record of 94 brand placements.When I wasn't counting product plugs I was laughing at Samantha. Apologies to Kim Caterall as I was not laughing with you but at you. You would think by time you are 52 yearsold you would be over your daddy issues and realise frequent intimate encounters will never fill the emotional void. On two occasions we were subjected to watching this sad lady desperately trying to fill her void with some guy. As predicted lazy Sam lets the man do all the work. It's always the ones who brag about it who are the worst at it.The most hilarious part was watching Sam and her pals sing the feminist anthem I Am Woman and why the hell not? Helen Reddy had long ago sold out her song to Coors and Burger King for a gigantic amount of money in her words. I smiled while I pondered this is what forty years of sexual revolution has given women the right to be a slave to overpriced fashion. The punchline of this joke is that they were singing I Am Woman in the United Arab Emirates  one of the most sexist countries in the world wherein women are commonly and legally abused. Sex And The City has a cute solution for Muslim women in the UAE Just swathe yourself in Dior sing bad karaoke and everything'll be alright.".

Liza was an embarrassment to the gay community  for some strange reason I have no idea why they adore her. Judging by this movie I have to ask why? The wedding was just a slight irritant to things to come.The whole story line with Miranda hating her job  Charlotte with the nanny who has never heard of the invention called a bra was so poorly executed  rushed. When Miranda quits I expected her to tell her boss where to shove it but they just cut off to a different scene. The nanny  that horrible Irish music playing when she's flopping her knockers about was just weird. The Irish music is okay but her flopping about with her boobies all over the place was embarrassing. Then they solved that storyline with Poof the nannies gay no threat problem solved. Their story lines were poorly written  executed.Samantha was written as a common floozy with no class. Again her story lines was poorly written  her character was assassinated. She used to have confidence  class. Well not no more she does not. Thecondom scene in the village square was embarrassing. I know i use the embarrass a lot but with this movie most of it you feel embarrassed.I also felt the characters remarks  their stares of the middle east was insulting. Who goes to another country just to sit there make catty remarks  gawk at the people there. Seriously? They played the whole middle east thing poorly into the ground.Carrie really came off at her worst in this film. Her constant nagging at Big made me want to strangle her. Her kiss with Aiden  the heart break on Big's face when she tells him has me pity Big for once instead of the other way around. She would get mad at him for any little thing then when he buys a TV she flips. A TV with the intentions of them spending time together. The moral of the story Nag  Cheat to get what you want? Are the writers retarded? The only characters I liked were Big  Miranda.

	schema:reviewBody "What to do what to do. You've made a mint a fortune. An incomprehensible pile of dough from your HBO TV show and syndication and DVD sales and the film version which made half a billion dollars and you know you know in your bones because your product is good that there is more money sitting there waiting to be made.Your fans still love you and haven't been won away to other shows your brand is sacred and almost uncontested in its niche. But... well it's getting to be a stretch. Sexy single women in their 30's struggling to make it in the big city have become married mothers in their 40's with fortunes of their own fortunes that seem a little tacky maybe in these days of conspicuous economy and restraint.What you should do is say We had our run.What you definitely shouldn't do is make your coda a twoandahalfhour long slapstick romp about rich dull women that look like ropy hunks of lacquered wood with jewels glued to them having a very expensive vacation in Abu Dhabi. Despite the impulse.Catching up with the girls two years down the road from the first film Sex and the City 2 catches Carrie Sarah Jessica Parker as she struggles with the boring realities of her marriage to Mr. Big Chris Noth and spends her time decorating their new apartment 12 floors down from their previous penthouse. Charlotte Kristin Davis is barely hanging on dealing with her daughter's terrible twos and the fear that her husband may have a thing for their fetching Irish nanny Alice Eve. Miranda Cynthia Nixon is chafing in her lawyer job trapped under the glass ceiling while P.R. agent Samantha Kim Cattrall struggles with the onset of menopause. Getting the girls together out at the premiere of a film Samantha is asked by a Sheik to visit his hotel in Abu Dhabi to design for him a P.R. campaign and she whisks her three friends off to the U.A.E. for a fabulous eachtoherownstretchMaybachlimo vacation. Some drinks some shopping some dishing a couple of romantic crises that arrive apropos of nothing and fizzle away into meaninglessness almost immediately.The film also suffers from its mightily weird choice to have the four sexually open imbibers spend their last hour of screentime among the burqaed ladies of Abu Dhabi.

	onyx:emotionText "What to do what to do. You've made a mint a fortune. An incomprehensible pile of dough from your HBO TV show and syndication and DVD sales and the film version which made half a billion dollars and you know you know in your bones because your product is good that there is more money sitting there waiting to be made.Your fans still love you and haven't been won away to other shows your brand is sacred and almost uncontested in its niche. But... well it's getting to be a stretch. Sexy single women in their 30's struggling to make it in the big city have become married mothers in their 40's with fortunes of their own fortunes that seem a little tacky maybe in these days of conspicuous economy and restraint.What you should do is say We had our run.What you definitely shouldn't do is make your coda a twoandahalfhour long slapstick romp about rich dull women that look like ropy hunks of lacquered wood with jewels glued to them having a very expensive vacation in Abu Dhabi. Despite the impulse.Catching up with the girls two years down the road from the first film Sex and the City 2 catches Carrie Sarah Jessica Parker as she struggles with the boring realities of her marriage to Mr. Big Chris Noth and spends her time decorating their new apartment 12 floors down from their previous penthouse. Charlotte Kristin Davis is barely hanging on dealing with her daughter's terrible twos and the fear that her husband may have a thing for their fetching Irish nanny Alice Eve. Miranda Cynthia Nixon is chafing in her lawyer job trapped under the glass ceiling while P.R. agent Samantha Kim Cattrall struggles with the onset of menopause. Getting the girls together out at the premiere of a film Samantha is asked by a Sheik to visit his hotel in Abu Dhabi to design for him a P.R. campaign and she whisks her three friends off to the U.A.E. for a fabulous eachtoherownstretchMaybachlimo vacation. Some drinks some shopping some dishing a couple of romantic crises that arrive apropos of nothing and fizzle away into meaninglessness almost immediately.The film also suffers from its mightily weird choice to have the four sexually open imbibers spend their last hour of screentime among the burqaed ladies of Abu Dhabi. That hour is spent pinballing violently from hilariously simple cultural dismissiveness  the ladies' response to Carrie's observation that veils make it seem like Muslim men don't want women to have a voice is to go to a nightclub and sing I am Woman to rapturous applause  to facile commentary on the real dirty pool being played in that part of the world  slave labour building 7star hotels  to borderline offensive exoticism to openly rude flaunting of the cultural mores of the city they've decided to visit.

This camera is literally introduced as a character when noelle offers it an hoordoov.' The camera participates the lights participate.

Sayles knows in real storytelling there's a game between teller and listener each trying to outwit the other. A masterful storyteller teases but plays by the rules allowing the reader to take risks. It takes craft to do this in the written word and is extremely rare using the more intimate but external and slippery experience of cinema.TRANSPORTING Alaskan wilderness as theme park where stories are safely refined for casual visitors. That would be enough given this level of craft. But Sayles takes us into Noelle's diary world. That's the center of this film's world the world of the mystical Shefox. Deep imagery here  superficially referenced in the real' action. I do not expect to ever forget that visit. The selfreference is in both.Much has been made of the actors and I think that a mistake since the creative force here is clearly Sayles. But this girl Martinez has some magic.

	schema:reviewBody "I'd suggest that viewers watch 'Limbo' on DVD with the voiceover narrative by John Sayles the director. A lot of insights provided there including a lot of little details which give you insight into moviemakingthe reason for multiple takes visual effects the importance of 'continuity' and even a lot about sound which was a big issue in the making of this film.I was amazed to learn that Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is such a terrific singershe sang all the songs and in fact her voice was recorded live while shooting the scenes not dubbed in later in postproduction. Sayles describes this in his narrative.Sayles had less to say in the narrative about the ending but based on the comments he DID make it was all quite intentionalnot the result of studio politics or a screenwriter Sayles himself who couldn't decide on a final ending. In fact I would suggest that it is Sayles' standing in the business that permitted this film to be produced  released without answering the question of what becomes of those characters though it also occurs to me that it could be the reason why this film didn't get much of a marketing push. Clearly the audience is left hanging indare I say ita state of limbo. Sayles has no intention based on his comments of a sequel though he invites anyone else to dream one up if they wish.But aside from all this it was a terrific film with interesting characters shot in unusual and often stunning locations Insomnia comes to mind when thinking of recent films shot in Alaska with its scenic backdrops.The cast was generally quite goodMastrantonio and Strathairn were terrific and Kris Kristofferson was a great choice as the likable but edgy local Smilin' Jack Johannson. Vanessa Martinez was for me less convincing as the daughter until the boat trip and beyond but that is when her character becomes truly important to the story and her work was quite good when it mattered most up to then it was all teenage angst.Overall I enjoyed 'Limbo' a great deal and the limbo in which the audience is left with such abruptness was for me almost a slap in the facea welcome onein striking contrast to the 'Star Wars' series in which George Lucas took 6 movies and nearly 30 years to tell us how Darth Vader came to be.Note I am NOT slamming Lucas or 'Star Wars' by that comment only making a point.".

	schema:headline " Arthouse TV movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This is certainly a film of two halves. It feels like an upmarket TV movie at first but the acting and camerawork are superior to that aforementioned fare. There is a sense of a community evoked by Sayles's direction as he follows a diverse array of characters and overlaps their problems with the actions of others while at the same time providing enough social commentary on the evils of capitalism that threaten the natural beauty of Alaska. This sociopolitical commentary is subtle enough because Sayles avoids stereotypes in his portrayal of the inhabitants. The first half feels fragmented at times but the presentation of the blossoming romance between the two main characters provides a seemingly stable counterpoint to the Altmanesque rendering of the tale.However the film is really a tease. It abandons the first half in favor of the unexpected Lord of the Flies scenario involving the three main characters for the second half. Moreover it changes mood full circle using fear and anxiety as the main concerns of the three stranded characters whose lives hang in the balance in a state of limbo as it were. I wasn't sure how the first half related to the second and I still feel uneasy about the total break Sayles employed between both parts. As a result it feels like two films joined together. I also feel Sayles abandoned any sense of a multithreaded narrative drive he successfully built into the first part in favor of the unexpected second part. The second part may symbolically allude to the film's title but it's also an abrupt digression of the preceding genre. Why bother with showing the first hour if it wasn't followed up? Why bother showing many characters in the first half then abandoning their concerns in the later as if it didn't matter? This is essentially a TV movie for the arthouse crowd but one that challenges and frustrates in equal measure.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is certainly a film of two halves. It feels like an upmarket TV movie at first but the acting and camerawork are superior to that aforementioned fare. There is a sense of a community evoked by Sayles's direction as he follows a diverse array of characters and overlaps their problems with the actions of others while at the same time providing enough social commentary on the evils of capitalism that threaten the natural beauty of Alaska. This sociopolitical commentary is subtle enough because Sayles avoids stereotypes in his portrayal of the inhabitants. The first half feels fragmented at times but the presentation of the blossoming romance between the two main characters provides a seemingly stable counterpoint to the Altmanesque rendering of the tale.However the film is really a tease. It abandons the first half in favor of the unexpected Lord of the Flies scenario involving the three main characters for the second half. Moreover it changes mood full circle using fear and anxiety as the main concerns of the three stranded characters whose lives hang in the balance in a state of limbo as it were. I wasn't sure how the first half related to the second and I still feel uneasy about the total break Sayles employed between both parts. As a result it feels like two films joined together. I also feel Sayles abandoned any sense of a multithreaded narrative drive he successfully built into the first part in favor of the unexpected second part. The second part may symbolically allude to the film's title but it's also an abrupt digression of the preceding genre. Why bother with showing the first hour if it wasn't followed up? Why bother showing many characters in the first half then abandoning their concerns in the later as if it didn't matter? This is essentially a TV movie for the arthouse crowd but one that challenges and frustrates in equal measure.";

The selfabsorption and the amazingly flamboyant failed attempts at good parenting are all part of the title Limbo. Mastroantonio's character is in perpetual limbo and as a result so is her daughter. Straithairn is simply trying to live in limbo due to an accident for which he feels responsible but isn't. The community is in limbo as well as industries close and local officials try to find a way to keep the economy afloat and their own pockets full. Although one could argue that the crisis  Straithairn's brother's 'situation'  is a little manipulative I didn't mind it and I loved the fact that the crisis led the trio to a 'timeout'  limbo within a limbo. It was filmed so beautifully acted so amazingly well and was so nice and slow that I almost felt envious of the characters for their situation  who in real life gets to put their life into a perspective while bonding with other truly caring souls? Of course being hunted by killers starving to death and worrying about dying in the Alaskan winter are no picnic...but there was a strong sense of togetherness and of honesty even painful and inappropriate honesty. As for the ending  well I too shouted 'NO!' at the screen but only because I ended up loving these characters so much I wanted to see them do well  to get out of limbo as they all so ardently wish for the final scene itself was so expressive both in the staging and the acting that it tore me up. Of course I didn't want them to die either! A perfectly formed movie. I will watch it again for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Sayles along with David Mamet is my favorite screenwriter.  Sayles unlike Mamet is a great director as well.  This film is an exploration of family morality love and survival.  The preview is no good so just trust me and watch the film.  The writing is outstanding.  There are parts of the film that contain the reading from a diary and the prose there is beautiful.  It is more than that it is exquisite.  The acting is first rate. David Sraitharn a long time Sayles actor gives a an excellent performance as Jumping Joe Gastineau a Jack of All trades guy looking for some love to fill the empty whole in his life.  Mary Elziabeth Mastriantonio who has been cut out of Hollywood now that she is over 35 is also very good.  She plays the Nomadic musician with child in tow.  She is just trying to put a life together and raise her child the best way she can.  The Characthers are real and the situations they are put in are interesting ones.  We get to find out about who these people are and what they are made of.  They are thrown together by chance and choice.  The young actress playing the daughter does fantastic job and I hope she continues to act although I haven't sene her again since.  The film is aptly name because Limbo is what the characters are in and it is also what you the viewer will be in.  I love these kinds of movies. I like to watch an interesting story with fascinating characters. If you don't know who John Sayles is then watch this movie and start watching his other films Lonestar Men with Guns Passion Fish Eight Men Out and of course Brother from another planet.".

This film is an exploration of family morality love and survival.  The preview is no good so just trust me and watch the film.  The writing is outstanding.  There are parts of the film that contain the reading from a diary and the prose there is beautiful.  It is more than that it is exquisite.  The acting is first rate. David Sraitharn a long time Sayles actor gives a an excellent performance as Jumping Joe Gastineau a Jack of All trades guy looking for some love to fill the empty whole in his life.  Mary Elziabeth Mastriantonio who has been cut out of Hollywood now that she is over 35 is also very good.  She plays the Nomadic musician with child in tow.  She is just trying to put a life together and raise her child the best way she can.  The Characthers are real and the situations they are put in are interesting ones.  We get to find out about who these people are and what they are made of.  They are thrown together by chance and choice.  The young actress playing the daughter does fantastic job and I hope she continues to act although I haven't sene her again since.  The film is aptly name because Limbo is what the characters are in and it is also what you the viewer will be in.  I love these kinds of movies. I like to watch an interesting story with fascinating characters. If you don't know who John Sayles is then watch this movie and start watching his other films Lonestar Men with Guns Passion Fish Eight Men Out and of course Brother from another planet.";

	schema:reviewBody "Patience may be a requisite for enjoying Limbo the latest opus from John Sayles a filmmaker who always challenges the limits of commercial moviemaking and who values the art of storytelling in his films as much as visual design.  His movies are not for all tastes however and much of his latest film seems languid and unfocused even though it is filled with fine performances beautiful majestic vistas of the Alaskan wilderness and an audacious assumption that the audience need not be wowed in the first fifteen minutes to ensure their continued interest.As with most of his films Sayles employs a novelistic approach patiently gathering the strands of his story together as he introduces us to each of his various characters.  Slowly almost leisurely we get to meet the people who occupy this Alaskan town as they take their place upon the canvas Sayles has painted.  Some emerge as major players in the tale some burst forth for a brief moment then recede to the background. The main characters include a former fisherman guilt ridden by the deaths of two of his friends while on a boat outing and an aging club singer desperately attempting to cope with a failing career a succession of loser boyfriends and a deeply troubled teenaged daughter who barely tolerates her mother and who abuses herself by cutting gashes into her arms as a cry for understanding and some stability in her life.One of the problems with the narrative is that Sayles sets up a set of other characters and conflicts around these three main players yet virtually drops them all when the three of them become stranded on an uninhabited island and the focus shifts entirely to them.  Unfortunately neither the singer Donna De Angelo Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio nor her daughter Noelle Vanessa Martinez nor especially the fisherman Joe Gastineau David Strathairn are sufficiently interesting in themselves to carry the weight of the whole drama.  What we lose is the richness provided by the Alaskan locals be they fish canners suddenly left unemployed by the closing of a local plant the tourist representative and the logging industry leader who clash over the age old issue of commerce vs. environment or the endless stream of geriatric tourists drifting by in the background creating a surreal image for the foreground drama.  These are the elements that rivet our attention and it is just these elements that evaporate in the second half of the film.  The conventional familyrelations drama we are left with provides insufficient compensation.Special note should be taken however of Mastrantonio's finely fleshed out interpretation of a mother struggling to come to grips with a myriad of problems and frustrations and just trying to find some personal peace and fulfillment in her world.  Strathairn however underplays his role so excessively that he often appears invisible in the film.  As the daughter Martinez is winning and effective.The movie also tacks on a silly ladyorthetiger ending that in the context of a more meaningful daring film might have been audacious and thoughtprovoking.  Here however it merely smacks of either last minute lack of inspiration or a more sinister possibility simple authorial smugness.All in all Limbo emerges as one of John Sayles's lesser cinematic achievements.".

John Sayles has written and directed a very wellpaced film with really interesting characters who are believably vulnerable. Vanessa Martinez is quite brilliant and intense as the daughter of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's character. David Starthairn is also great. Overall it is very well acted and the story is interesting until the end. I prefer Limbo to the Sayles film which most reviewers at least here in Sweden think is a masterpiece Lone Star. I liked Lone Star too but I have to say that I found both the characters and story in Limbo more interesting. SPOILER follows. The only thing that disappointed me was the ending. Well I don't know if disappointment was what I felt since I really like movies that don't go to far and bring on the fairy tale ending. However not knowing how it ended for the characters if they get murdered or rescued was at least a little irritating. 710".

For example the culture clash between the Alaskans and the tourist industry was totally gratuitous. There is also an inordinate amount of small talk that leads nowhere. All of this could be forgiven if once the story kicks into gear with the mother daughter and David Strathairn stranded on a remote island something happened. Unfortunately the second half in the wild is tedious and boring. I recommend fast forwarding every time the daughter picks up the diary. All the fine acting and beautiful scenery cannot hide the fact that this movie is way too long for such slight material and the conjectural ending is totally unacceptable.  MERK".

	schema:reviewBody "I happened to read the short novel by Kennaway before seeing its movieversion Tunes of Glory. The novel is good but quite uncommonly the film is much better which is mainly due to the stunning excellence of acting. For instance reading the book I wasn't quite convinced by the final mental collapse of Jock Sinclair with his beyondanypossiblepraise performance Alec Guinness made me wholly understand the deep inner sufferings of the outwardly friendly tough rash Scottish officer.The story is very simple few things happens. The film is almost entirely located in the barracks of a Highlanders regiment. Here we find a somewhat conventional clash between the lowerclass major Jock Sinclair and the upperclass colonel Barrow John Mills who suddenly replaces Jock in the command of the regiment. Jock has started as a simple piper and has gained his grades on the battlefield during World War II. We gather that he is a natural born soldierhero with the typical virtues but also with the defects of natural born heroes for instance a certain lack of intelligence and sensitiveness. For Jock the war was just a stimulating if tough adventure where he had the opportunity to test his courage and honor. Barrow comes from the Military Academy and has much more education manners and perhaps intelligence than Jock. And by sure he wholly and bravely accomplished his duties during the war but we see that differently from the lighthearted Jock the horrors of the war have left deep traces in his mind which increased his natural excitability to a breakingpoint. He deeply feels the grief of being looked at as an intruder by the tight community of the other officers.In the movie we find many subtleties on military life. The attachment to the Highlanders tradition is symbolized by the officers' use of calling each other by first name and of drinking whisky in this sense important is the scene when a false friend refuses Jock's offer of a glass of whisky and takes gin instead. We realize that this impoliteness is not a trifle as it may seem. John Mills is superb in his design of Barrow and he's only surpassed by Guinness. But the whole cast is fantastic. How good is the average British actor is always amazing for me. Alec Guinness for me is the greatest actor of all times. He doesn't act he IS Jock Sinclair as he was the myriad of other characters he BECAME during his glorious career. He is so good that after all I think that he was underrated despite his fame. Rest in peace great Sir Alec and thank you for all. A final remark. I read somewhere that many British critics and directors not least Alfred Hitchcock have considered Tunes of Glory the best movie ever made. Indeed even an Italian as myself can feel that this magnificent film touches some profound chords of the British soul.".

	schema:reviewBody "A clash of wills and personalities between two men one a psychologically scarred idealist the other driven by ego and his own needs to the point of cruelty is examined in the peacetime military drama Tunes of Glory' directed by Ronald Neame and starring Alec Guinness and John Mills.  Major Jock Sinclair Guinness is the acting Colonel of a Scottish regiment but as the story begins he has been notified that he has been passed over for promotion and his replacement Lieutenant Colonel Basil Barrow Mills is en route to take command.  Sinclair is a soldier's soldier a man's man loved and respected with some qualifications by his men.  He has clawed his way up through the ranks was once a piper he would've been happy as a Pipe Major in fact but Hitler as he says at one point Changed all that' and feels strongly that he should have been made Colonel of the regiment. Barrow on the other hand is an aristocrat and a third generation officer of this particular regiment.  He suffers however from his experience in a prisonerofwar camp and has never fully recovered the impact of which is succinctly expressed when he tells his Captain that he never really came back.  From the beginning it's an almost impossible situation and from the moment Barrows arrives the atmosphere is thick with tension as he and Sinclair square off in a contest from which it is readily evident that neither will emerge unscathed in one way or another .Working from a tight intelligent screenplay by James Kennaway adapted from his own novel Neame delivers a taut insightful character driven drama that explores the diversity of human nature and illustrates the good and evil contained within us all and the traits which ultimately determine which will be the prevalent manifestation of the individual personality. Through the device of placing the protagonist and the antagonist each the antithesis of the other in a nowin situation the film examines motivations actions and reactions that can lead the story in any number of directions none of which are positive but all of which are logical and which finally leads to a conclusion that is extremely powerful incisive and totally believable.  As Jock Sinclair you see Alec Guinness in a role quite unlike anything else he's ever done it was in fact his own personal favorite of all of his cinematic creations.  Sinclair is a man who is course and roughhewn an egoist who when the personal need arises will wantonly subject those around him to psychological cruelty in order to elevate himself and his position and to assuage his own ego.  At mess for example he derides a young officer for not smoking his cigarette like a man he orders every man' to drink whiskey implying that to do otherwise constitutes an assessment of an individual's masculinity.  Boisterous bravura and ribald behavior are his tools of navigation through life coupled with an attitude of doing things his way or the wrong way.  And Guinness plays it to the hilts.  Beginning with his whole perspective and attitude he IS Sinclair while physically he embodies and expresses exactly who this man is and what he stands for.  At times his eyes fairly bulge with an enthusiasm that suggests a lasciviousness underlying the cruelty when he walks he strides purposefully and carries himself in such a way that when he enters a room he veritably fills it and makes his presence felt so that the very air seems oppressed by him.  It's a performance that even in a strong year of Oscar contenders Trevor Howard Lancaster Lemmon Olivier and Tracy were all up for Best Actor Lancaster won he deserved to be among them.  In this film Guinness is quite simply unforgettable in one of his most powerful roles.John Mills as well delivers a superb introspective performance as Barrow capturing the way in which this man must live so inwardly to survive and conveying how difficult it is for him to continue on while attempting to live up to his heritage and the expectations of a position to which he is clearly unfit in his current mental state.  In Barrow we see reflected the prevailing attitude of the times that might makes right' and that anything less is akin to unacceptable negligence that same military mindset that put Jake Holman at odds with the world in The Sand Pebbles' and led to the unfortunate incident depicted so eloquently in A Few Good Men.'  It's an excellent understated sensitive performance by Mills who plays brilliantly off of Guinness's brutishness.The film also boasts a number of excellent supporting performances especially Dennis Price as Major Charlie Scott whose stoic assessment of himself as well as the situation at hand serves as the film's conscience Gordon Jackson as the sympathetic Captain Jimmy Cairns and Duncan Macrae in a memorable turn as Pipe Major Duncan MacLean.Also included in this outstanding supporting cast are Kay Walsh Mary John Fraser Ian Susannah York In her film debut as Morag Sinclair Percy Herbert Riddick Allan Cuthbertson Eric and Angus Lennie Orderly.  A powerful film that so successfully demonstrates the devastating effects of dysfunctional human relationships and conveys the need to look beyond ourselves Tunes of Glory' presents a story to which everyone will be able to relate because the theme is applicable to any setting involving human interactions.  A thoroughly involving film featuring a number of memorable performances especially by Guinness that will give you reason to take pause and reflect and hopefully add some perspective to a world too often mired in unnecessary turmoil.  I rate this one 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "I finally had the chance to see this film in its entirety on Bravo a few days ago. Ronald Neame was not a director of the first rank and  he probably wasnt even a director of the second but this is NOT  a directors picture. It is a picture carried by superb acting and a brilliant script.I am now convinced that Guinness was one of the greatest screen actors that ever livedif not the greatest.. This performance surpasses even his Colonel Nicholson in Bridge on the River Kwai or his magnificent performances in the Ealing comedies. His boorish arrogant but oddly touching and vulnerable Jock Sinclair is a full length portrait worthy of Rembrandtor Dostoevsky.John Mills as the by the book  colonel whose aloof exterior hides enormous psychic scars is almost equally good.Dennis Price as a friend who turns his back on Sinclair and the superb Gordon Jackson  he was  a great actor long long before Upstairs Downstairsas a restrained sensitive officer who tries  ineffectually to help both antagonists are almost equally good. All of the other performances are very fine.The films beautifully written sometimes funny usually achingly sad script is a profound meditation on honor tradition repression and class conflict. Guinnesses soliloquy at the end is  one of the most heartbreaking moments in all of film.".

	onyx:emotionText "I finally had the chance to see this film in its entirety on Bravo a few days ago. Ronald Neame was not a director of the first rank and  he probably wasnt even a director of the second but this is NOT  a directors picture. It is a picture carried by superb acting and a brilliant script.I am now convinced that Guinness was one of the greatest screen actors that ever livedif not the greatest.. This performance surpasses even his Colonel Nicholson in Bridge on the River Kwai or his magnificent performances in the Ealing comedies. His boorish arrogant but oddly touching and vulnerable Jock Sinclair is a full length portrait worthy of Rembrandtor Dostoevsky.John Mills as the by the book  colonel whose aloof exterior hides enormous psychic scars is almost equally good.Dennis Price as a friend who turns his back on Sinclair and the superb Gordon Jackson  he was  a great actor long long before Upstairs Downstairsas a restrained sensitive officer who tries  ineffectually to help both antagonists are almost equally good. All of the other performances are very fine.The films beautifully written sometimes funny usually achingly sad script is a profound meditation on honor tradition repression and class conflict. Guinnesses soliloquy at the end is  one of the most heartbreaking moments in all of film.";

	schema:headline " A few details about Tunes of Glory";
	schema:reviewBody "These are just a few notes on one of my favorite films Tunes of Glory which I recently watched again in its new Criterion DVD release.  The plot is welldescribed by many posters below so I won't bother with that.The more I watch this film the more I appreciate the wealth of detailed characterization it contains.  On Barrow's first meeting with the officers of the regiment as he is introduced to the rotund Major Dusty Miller note John Mills' quick downward glance of disapproval at the Major's corpulent gut.  In the following scene where Jock Sinclair offers Barrow a whiskey Barrow courteously replies that whiskey does not agree with him to Jock's dismay.  We later learn that Barrow is emotionally unstable has problems controlling his rage and that his family life has broken up. Could alcoholism be an issue explaining his aversion to whiskey?  While Guinness and Mills are justly praised I find the performance by Dennis Price as Major Charlie Scott to be very interesting as well.  Bringing to mind Ralph Richardson he exudes an oily genteel but detached sort of uppercrust English manner that Colonel Sinclair gleefully mocks old boy old boy old boy.  When RSM Riddick Percy Herbert distractingly bringing to mind Michael Palin in appearance and exaggerated military manner tries to officially express the doubts of those in his own strata in the military hierarchy about the prosecution of Jock Sinclair Barrow's first reaction is curiously bemused and sarcastic you astonish me.  Barrow subsequently snaps into martinet mode and brusquely dismisses Riddick's petition.  His initial bemusement though is telling in that his instinct is not to take this man from a lower level of the social and military hierarchy seriously at all treating him almost as an unruly child who needs be put in his place.  Having seen power struggles personality clashes and class divisions like this in my work experience I see that this all rings true. As foreign exotic and strange as the setting characters and language are to an American like me the themes of this story are so universal that they can be immediately appreciated by almost anyone who's experienced life to some degree.As for the language it's a delight to finally have a DVD with English subtitles to clarify some of the spoken lines.  The picture by the way is excellent on the new DVD except for the intermittent appearance of a dark streak down the right side of the screen near the end of the film.  I would have thought this could be fixed with digital restoration but the cost of that might have been prohibitive and though a little distracting it really doesn't spoil my enjoyment.  I think it's fitting that there are no negative reviews here thus far.".

	schema:headline " What fine reviews";
	schema:reviewBody "As a very late reviewer I see that very much of what I would have said has already been said so I endorse rather than repeat it. What is surprising is that these lengthy perceptive and very admiring reviews have come not from the film's country of origin but from the USA where it seems to have struck a particular chord. Reviewers have noted Guinness's perhaps finest ever performance as well as very unusually the fine ensemble playing where script casting and direction must all have been of similar quality.I would take issue with the reviewer who said that the Mills character would never have been given command. Clearly he had been highly educated had a long and distinguished career in a headquarters job following a traumatic time as a POW of the Japanese. He would have at least earned some kind of moral right at the end of his career and in peacetime to be given the job that he believed he really wanted and might have thought to have been among friends. He would most likely have been highly respected owed favours and been able to pull strings. Had Jock Sinclair Guinness  unashamedly uneducated rough and proud to have been educated in Barlinnie jail Glasgow and deeply popular with his men not been the officer he replaced most likely Colonel Barrow would have made a success of it. The whole entirely believable tragedy came about through the grotesque mischance that with these so different characters one had to wrest command  and respect of the men  from the other. Colonel Barrow's fragility was only exposed when he tried to impose his English civilising ways on the one person whose whole being rejected them. Bad enough if it had been simply about class here it was a battle for the Scottish soul. These deeper levels of conflict deriving from earlier historical intraScottish battles was suggested by one reviewer. The film tells a story which perhaps could have been set in almost any country with a strong military tradition  France. Germany Japan etc rather like its near namesake Paths of Glory by Stanley Kubrick set in WW1 France. Here though the central conflict presumably had very deep roots in Scottish ethnic and tribal history of clan wars of Highlanders vs Lowlanders even of those supposed Englishloving traitors who sold Scotland to a parcel of rogues The English in 1707. It may well be that for Sinclair the entirely Anglicised Colonel Barrow gindrinking aloof distant and without a hint of a Scottish accent represented exactly that kind of treacherous pseudoScot.One reviewer describes it as pure John Ford leaving it unclear if he is suggesting that it was similar or derivative. With art in general its lower and by definition least original forms ape others. This film does not ape any other  as already said the intensity of the conflict derives not just from class but from old old historical grievances between two intimately close nations. In Old Europe grievances and rivalries ran long and deep. Just a rather sad footnote. One reviewer mentioned similarities to earlier John FordJohn Wayne movies. The entire John Wayne archive is to be seen on a continuously circulating basis on two of Britain's five national television channels State broadcaster the BBC and socalled public service broadcaster Channel 4. Yet in contrast Tunes of Glory has rarely been shown. It reappeared 2 years ago but in a poor quality print on a remote satellite channel which plays mainly public domain material. Many of Britain's fine vigorous quality films of the 1960s have never been shown at all on British television until a few months ago when again a very minor satellite channel started showing them Otley The Hireling The Reckoning and others. I did not see them originally and it was revelation seeing the bold acting and directing talent which existed then and how sad is the current decline into the Lock Stock etc formulaic gangster stuff. Very curious indeed that great British films are not shown on the supposed British public service channels and it is left to small satellite channels Movies4Men and Simply Movies to show them. Very curious indeed. Public service broadcasting not in the service of the public.".

	schema:headline " A Shattering Dissection of a Scottish Regiment";
	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to say anything new about this marvelous film  possibly the last great film Alec Guiness had the starring role in although some STAR WAR fans may disagree with that assessment. Guiness as Major Jock Sinclair is a man's man and the popular head of a Scottish army regiment. Since the war ended he has been in charge of it and there have been no complaints. But one day he learns that the Army brass have decided to appoint John Mills Lt. Col. Basil Barrow as the Regiment's new commander.Guiness is not a coward  he has fought his way up the ranks on the battlefields of Europe and the others in the regiment know this. But Mills is an unknown quantity. He is aloof and he is English. Nobody can tell whether or not he has any inner reserves of strength or what was once called moxie to win their respect. So soon Mills finds that while his commands are heard the men are still basically looking to Guiness for real leadership.It becomes a quiet but steady battle between the two men to see who is the real head of the regiment. Even when due to personal problems Guiness is arrested for drunkenness Mills keeps fumbling his attempts to put him under control. Part of the problem is psychological  Mills has had a very rough time during the war. He was tortured badly by the Nazis in one of their camps. He has been just beginning to pull himself together. The lack of respect he is being shown is not helping.The characterizations in the film are wonderful in particular Dennis Price. Mills had been the star of GREAT EXPECTATIONS in the late 1940s with Guiness in support. Price had been the actual star as the scheming Louis D'Ascoyne  Mazzini in KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS again opposite Guiness. Here Price is Major Charles Scotty Scott who has usually been Guiness's closest friend but has stumbled. In typical Price doubledealing he has made a play for Kay Walsh Guiness's girlfriend and has not been totally rejected when Guiness learns of this he goes into his bender which leads to his arrest. Price however is more complex than one would initially believe. He of all the regiment officers does not go to Guiness to doublecheck the orders of Mills. Price feels that Mills as commanding officer needs no doublechecking. The others are there to obey him.But then Mills decides to be nice to that drunken scamp Guiness  and Guiness and his friends sees this as weakness not kindness. Mills finds that the last shreds of his rank's dignity are gone...especially after he and Price have some quiet words while Price is playing billiards. Basically Price tells Mills that it is impossible now to have any respect for the Lt. Col. And this leads to the final double tragedy at the end.Dennis Price from what I have read on this board had many family and financial problems and emotional problems that led to an alcoholism that smashed his career. But his performance as Scotty relatively short in comparison to Guiness and Mills in this film was a quietly effective and superb one. One only wishes his personal demons could have been controlled so that he could have given us more performances as this one.".

To my mind Alec Guinness is the premier actor of the century his performances have immeasurably enriched my inner life.I am not as enamored of Tunes of Glory as I am of say Bridge on the River Kwai but it is without question a powerful movie. The conflict between Sinclair and Barrow is palpable I think in particular of Mill's violently trembling rage during the dancing scene and Guinness's dismissive ridicule of Barrow's deepest confidences toy soldiers! during his attempt to con him into clemency.

	schema:reviewBody "Alec Guinness is an amazingly underappreciated actor. While most remembered for his ObiWan character this was one of his least interesting or demanding roles. Few today realize the depth and range of his characterizations as well as the realism that he infused his characters with in his previous films. He was one of the finest British actors and this film is yet another example of his skills.Guinness plays an angry and blustering Scottish officer who may also be an alcoholic he at least is a problem drinker and shows many signs of alcoholism. The film begins with this popular officer throwing a farewell party of sorts with the men in his command. It seems that Guinness was given temporary command but a replacement John Mills is due to arrive shortlydashing Guinness' hopes for this position becoming permanent.Because Guinness' character is so very flawed and petty he does much to try to undermine the new C.O.. In particular Mills is a by the book sort of officer and Guinness ignores changes Mills ordersand by example derision and a lack of respect for Mills spreads through the ranks. Instead of behaving like officers and gentlemen the men behave like this is some sort of popularity contest and they show contempt for their new leader. None of this is helped by Guinness' drinking as it gets him in trouble and creates serious problems for the regiment.While Mills as usual does a great job in the film playing a man who is suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder the film is definitely Guinness'. His boorish character is a great example of him once again immersing himself into a character and the way he responds to the tragedy near the end of the film gives the character great depth and a bit of sympathysomething you needed to make this a standout film.The bottom line is that this film is extremely wellcrafted. The acting is universally excellent the script tense and wellwritten and the film is great unless you are the type of person who demands lots of action. While a film about the military this is no action film. Wonderful.".

Instead of behaving like officers and gentlemen the men behave like this is some sort of popularity contest and they show contempt for their new leader. None of this is helped by Guinness' drinking as it gets him in trouble and creates serious problems for the regiment.While Mills as usual does a great job in the film playing a man who is suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder the film is definitely Guinness'. His boorish character is a great example of him once again immersing himself into a character and the way he responds to the tragedy near the end of the film gives the character great depth and a bit of sympathysomething you needed to make this a standout film.The bottom line is that this film is extremely wellcrafted. The acting is universally excellent the script tense and wellwritten and the film is great unless you are the type of person who demands lots of action. While a film about the military this is no action film. Wonderful.";

But that very stigma is what hurts him as he is never really given a chance to be seen as anything more than a privileged fool so then you pity him. Guiness plays a character who worked very hard for everything he has and is to be admired until you realize he doesn't give any room for kindness or compassion and then you pity him too but for different reasons. I saw this movie at 300 am on a work night and couldn't move from the screen despite my early day at work.

Rough and wild for once he is cast against type yet emerges triumphant in an acting master class.The book is a slim volume but is fast moving and full of character.  Set in provincial Scotland the flavour of the film is as strong as the novel by James Kennaway who also wrote the screenplay but the characterisation by the actors builds on and then surpasses the script.  I note that neither of the actors is Scottish and this amazes me.  Maybe I should seek advice from a Scot on this matter.We never leave the barracks or the quiet army town and so learn only by rumour how Jock Sinclair on some blasted field at the centre of El Alamein saved his regiment and turned the battle.  Half the officers and men were dead the cause lost yet his spirit and the force of his will brought him a battlefield promotion to acting colonel. The Regiment is what he lives for.Several years later in peacetime the army catches up with its paperwork and sends a proper officer to take back the reins. Basil Barrow arrives unexpectedly from a desk job and Sandhurst. His assignment is to organise and civilise the men long gone wild under Jock's supervision.  John Mills plays the rather impotent lonely Barrow as an accentless and educated man. There are dark rumours amongst the men that he may be English.The clash between the two men commences immediately on their meeting and ends in scenes of mourning and redemption.This is an actors film.  There are few effects and much of the action is centred on one or the other of Guinness or Mills.  Sinclair is a piper this gives him an almost spiritual air and his feel for music the Tunes of Glory is the first area of contention between the two Colonels.  When Jock leads his men in a wild and unruly reel with arms flailing and much shouting and yipping at a society ball the ensuing fit from the uptight and conservative Mills is wonderful.  He trembles and shakes and we do likewise.The film builds and builds to a finale full of Tunes of Glory and we come to an understanding about both men as they come to understand each other.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fine movie. If anyone wants to examine the difference between what passes for a good movie these days and a good movie fifty years ago Tunes of Glory is a good place to start. The direction is economical with little in the way of razzle dazzle. Ronald Neame has almost edited himself out of existence. And the writers are equally straightforward. I'll give an example. As Col. Barrows John Mills spent several years in a POW camp during World War II as a result of which he's about to pop. This is a golden opportunity for a dramatic flashback. Neame could have stopped the narrative short and taken us back to a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Burma or someplace and then shown us Mills starving Mills shivering with fever Mills being waterboarded Mills being beaten by sadistic guards Mills crawling through the mud. But instead we see Mills and a younger captain Gordon Jackson racing along in a Jeep. Mills pulls the vehicle to a halt slumps behind the wheel and in a brief monologue he tells Jackson a little of his experiences. The scene lasts about two minutes. That's economy. And it's all the more effective for not being spelled out in detail. The horrors are left to our imaginations.The movie is a Shakespearian kind of tragedy addressed to adults and the script leaves a lot to the viewer's own judgment. There are no easy good guys and bad guys. That brings us to the acting and I'm reluctant to get into it for fear of running out of space. Alec Guiness is Jock Sinclair the longtime temporary commander of the Scottish regiment who is replaced by an uptight bythebook John Mills. Guiness has never been better. He's been as good before but not better. Let's just say he embodies the bluff raucous whiskyloving brave deceitful superior officer very different from his Col. Nicholson in The Bridge on the River Kwai. He has the most screen time but John Mills has the more complicated role  a commander new to his post unknown to his men given to following the kinds of rules that Guiness has made a point of ignoring slightly deranged by his war experiences loyal to the regiment and willing to compromise his principles for its sake. When Mills lets Guiness get away with a major public offense Guiness tells him he's grateful but then goes on to celebrate what he deems his victory over Mills. Guiness and his loyal officers carry on loudly and drunkenly at one end of the table while Mills sits humiliated and alone at the other. Mills loses more than his dignity. One of the officers  next in command in fact  is Dennis Price in a splendid performance. Want a challenge? Figure out if he's a good guy or a bad guy. Justify your answers. Five minutes allowed beginning  now! The location which looks more like the Edinburgh Castle than a military barracks are almost as beautiful as the teenaged Susannah York.Enough. Watch this film.".

The mood of the film was perfectly captured by a cast of outstanding British character actors led most ably by Gordon Jackson in the world of post wartime Britain.  The barrickscastle backdrop is itself a character in the film. However its indeed an actor's film.  Guinness's soliloquy at the end of the movie is worth the price of admission and should be mandatory for any wouldbe actor to view prior to entering the trade.  Guinness is matched scene for scene with John Mills portrayal of Col Barrows.  Movies such as this and Carol Reed's The Third Man with Orson Wells was the backbone of two decades of outstanding British cinema.  This movie joined an impressive list of movies to be ignored by Academy of Motion Pictures and the Oscar. If nothing else the soundtrack is a bagpipe lover's dream.  In a personal aside chance for name dropping I had the opportunity to met Gregory Peck once and he in a brief moment he was asked about great performances in great roles and without hesitation chose Guinness's Colonel Sinclair as one of his top three comtemporary performances first of course was his Attackus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird.

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film dozens of times over the years and always relish the chance to introduce it to new viewers. People are always impressed by the power of the story and the brilliance of the acting. It is one of the finest British films ever made and just a tremendous film period.Alec Guinness is astonishing as the rowdy hard drinking leader of a Scottish Army regiment a few years after the end of the Second World War. The sophisticated roles he is known for are swept away by his blustering boorish Colonel Jock Sinclair. He completely inhabits the role from the moment we first see him at a drunken farewell party on the evening before the new commanding officer is to arrive and take over. John Mills is equally good as his opposite number Colonel Basil Barrow a gentlemanly reserved type who wants to change the crude manners and uncouth image of the regiment but is hopelessly outclassed from the beginning by Jock's popularity with the troops. The growing clash of wills between the two leaders becomes more intense and can only end in the utter defeat of one of them or the other. Colonel Barrow's difficulties in assuming command are made worse by his suffering the after effects of imprisonment in a POW camp where he was tortured almost to insanity. Thus the stage is set for a disastrous outcome of the power struggle of these two men.All the supporting performances are excellent with fine work by Dennis Price as a friend of Jock whose loyalties are suspect Gordon Jackson as the adjutant caught in the middle John Fraser as a young piper in love with Jock's daughter Susannah York in her film debut and many other great British character actors. The atmosphere of tradition and Scots pride in the regiment and a vanishing way of life is amazingly real. The look of the barracks in the ancient castle that overlooks the town the squads of men drilling and exercising in the cold the pictures and weapons that line the walls a palpable sense of the heritage of the place and the regiment are conveyed with total believability. And above all the music. From the opening bagpipe tune over the credits to the parades and gatherings to the mournful dignity of the pipes at the tragic ending the music is the very soul of the picture. I cannot praise this movie enough. It is a masterpiece of acting on the parts of both Mills and Guinness and a superbly written and directed film that is a moving and unforgettable story.".

So much so that he has been made Acting Colonel of an unnamed Scottish regiment. Sadly for him his informal barracks is going to be reformed under the auspices of the public school via Sandhurst graduate Lt. Col. Basil Barrow John Mills who believes in doing all things bythebook. This sets the scene for a post WW2 power battle under a grey Scottish winter sky.When writing a review of any excellent film  such as this  you are frightened you are going to put people off by its limits. However this is a classic example of less really being more. The claustrophobic atmosphere and the sense that armies without wars are prone to be heavy with politics. Not unlike like prisons To many people in the same space with too much time on their hands. They drive men mad and extend the worst in the human character.Guinness and Mills are fantastic actors. Oscar winners both and more. They could read the phone book and captivate an audience. For the record they had both seen war service although Mills baby face and short stature had made him the butt of many jokes many he was happy to retell. Did this help form his character? The guy who was laughed at and therefore worked even harder to enforce discipline or gain respect. This is naturally speculation.I have no the knowledge of author of book and film but just by watching you know he has seen it for real. The little details that only the insider would know. The story would just as well be served as a theatre piece and it employs some its stock devices. The accidental narrator being the more obvious. Maybe this was to save money but it would not have helped the picture to see  say  the incident that Mills had to endure from the Japanese.Eyewitness testimony from the filming says that Guinness thought he would look silly in a kilt and used fake tanner on his pale legs. He is not the biggest of men and has to stick out his chest and stand on tiptoe to be imposing but you do believe him. What an actor he was. An actor's actor. Like Peter Sellars totally bland out of character and not always very nice as he writes in his various autobiographies but always mesmeric on screen. Mills  on the other hand  could never work as a bad guy. The perfect uncle figure who you would want to confide in.I am maybe giving the support cast shortshrift  but most British films of the time had quality character actors. No exception here. Amazing to see Susannah York in her first role. Alfred Hitchcock himself said Tunes of Glory was his own personal favourite film. It is not quite mine but a great demonstration of how brilliant film can be when top class actors get their teeth in to a wonderful script. The end is pure Shakespeare. Don't watch it once watch it twice...".

This is naturally speculation.I have no the knowledge of author of book and film but just by watching you know he has seen it for real. The little details that only the insider would know. The story would just as well be served as a theatre piece and it employs some its stock devices. The accidental narrator being the more obvious. Maybe this was to save money but it would not have helped the picture to see  say  the incident that Mills had to endure from the Japanese.Eyewitness testimony from the filming says that Guinness thought he would look silly in a kilt and used fake tanner on his pale legs. He is not the biggest of men and has to stick out his chest and stand on tiptoe to be imposing but you do believe him. What an actor he was. An actor's actor. Like Peter Sellars totally bland out of character and not always very nice as he writes in his various autobiographies but always mesmeric on screen. Mills  on the other hand  could never work as a bad guy. The perfect uncle figure who you would want to confide in.I am maybe giving the support cast shortshrift  but most British films of the time had quality character actors. No exception here. Amazing to see Susannah York in her first role. Alfred Hitchcock himself said Tunes of Glory was his own personal favourite film. It is not quite mine but a great demonstration of how brilliant film can be when top class actors get their teeth in to a wonderful script. The end is pure Shakespeare. Don't watch it once watch it twice...";

Every role no matter how small is meticulously cast and the actors give well rounded performances. It is a lot like the military service films that John Ford did in America. In fact there's more than a passing resemblance to Fort Apache in the rivalry between Guinness and Mills here and John Wayne and Henry Fonda in Fort Apache.

	schema:reviewBody "It's October 10 2008 and I've just watched Tunes Of Glory on DVD. I give you the date because it is now more than 52 years since the end of World War II and that is relevant. Tunes Of Glory is about unresolved grief for friends and comrades in arms who have died in battle. Those now very old men who fought in WWII those who fought in Korea those who fought in Vietnam and Iraq and those who fought in the many other smaller engagements around the world since then might be familiar with that grief but a great many of us won't. Are great many of us are the babyboomers who grew up to smoke dope and sneer at our father's generation and the occasional show of emotion they felt for friends and comrades alongside whom they had fought and who unlike them had been unable to cheat death. My father born in 1923 and who enlisted in 1942 took part in the DDay invasion in June 1944. He finally developed cancer in the late Eighties and died in 1991. But oddly enough he a man who was always something of a hypochondriac all his life spoke nor one word of complaint when he was for once very ill and knew he was to die. He said that after seeing so many of his friends and comrades killed in the war every day since then had been a gift and he could not complain now that his life was finally going to come to an end. Tunes Of Glory is a film for his generation. The two main characters portrayed by Alec Guinness and John Mills have neither of them really come to terms with their experiences in the war and the deaths of comrades in arms but both coped with it in different ways. Mills retreats into being a stickler but that doesn't save him from his grief. Guinness copes far better but is still damaged but at least he survives. Both are very different characters both strong in their own way but both also weak. The Mills character ironically demonstrates his strength by going against the grain and giving way. The Guinness character's weakness is more hidden  he has the affection and loyalty of his men but his flaw is that that affection and loyalty is vital to him. Without it and the battalion he led for a while it seems that his whole life might fall apart. The film itself is quite static and this production would not be out of place on a stage. But that is no criticism. It is not a director's film but an actor's film  you watch the film for the story and acting not the direction and cinematography. In that sense it is quite oldfashioned but that too is no criticism. The only drawback is that it might mean nothing at all to the MTV generation and that it might only be fully appreciated again once  heaven forbid  we have another world war and once again men and women are destined to cope somehow with a grief they find almost impossible to express. In that sense  in the sense that until this planet becomes uninhabitable and mankind ceases to exist we will always go to war and we will always lose friends and comrade in arms and we will always ask ourselves why did I survive but not him or her  this film will always carry an emotional clout and will be timeless.".

There is no Africa Italy or Germany Star on Barrows' uniform to show that he fought the Germans. Finally there was nothing in the movie about whether Barrows fought the Germans in 1940 Norway 1940 France 1941 Greece 1941 Crete or assisting the various resistance movements in Occupied Europe.Sinclair got rapid promotion as an officer. He enlisted in the army in 1933 and won the Military Medal however that medal was awarded only to enlisted and NCO ranks so he must have won it along with the General Service Medal for seeing action during the 19361939 Arab revolt in Palestine and then was shortly commissioned during or after the revolt because World War II in Europe broke out in September 1939 and three years late Sinclair become temporarily battalion commander during the Battle of El Alamein and won the Distinguished Service Order awarded to officers only.All in all an excellent movie".

Pressing the flesh meeting his constituency face to face. He is more apt to apply the pressure of his office in order to get what he wants than he is to seek a consensus on matters. Tracy is perfect in this role. In many ways it is Tracy's last hurrah. He would appear in only a handful of films after this one. Since the film was made in 1958 you could also say that his style of acting is giving way to a new breed as well.Jeffrey Hunter is effective as Tracy's nephew.

Wallace Ford and Frank McHugh add local flavor to their roles as traditional opponents to Skeffington.But it is Tracy who carries this film and he does so handsomely. I am one who believes that many of his best performances were his last ones. I think because he seemed more natural and there seems to be less effort and fewer mannerisms in these performances.

	schema:headline " Skeffington...Skeffington...Cast Your Vote For Skeffington...";
	schema:reviewBody "In the early 1930s John Ford directed a relatively unknown actor in a forgotten film called UP THE RIVER about prison. After that effort they went their separate ways Ford usually directing at 20th Century Fox Republic and other studios RKO for MARY OF Scotland but rarely at MGM. And when he was developing into Hollywood's greatest director Tracy after an initially unrewarding period at Fox went to MGM and became their leading actorstar. But neither managed to find a project to do with the other. Then in 1958 Ford approached Tracy to play Mayor Frank Skeffington the hero of Edwin O'Connor's novel THE LAST HURRAH. This time with both director and actor at their peaks the result was far more memorable than UP THE RIVER had been.O'Connor's novel a best seller in it's day was a fictionalization of parts of the career of James Michael Curley a man who became synonymous with the city of Boston. Boston's laws were peculiar regarding electing Mayors. After some bad experiences in the 19th and early 20th Century the city decided that Mayors could not have consecutive terms in office  that they could serve as Mayor frequently but like Grover Cleveland's two terms as President not one term following another. This was okay with Curley who ended up the most reelected Mayor in Boston serving four terms each four years in length over a period of two and a half decades with a two year term as Governor of Massachusetts as well. A remarkable career for his day or any day. He was corrupt as they come  but he always pointed out that his corruption benefited the public usually it did. It was like the old Tammany Hall dictum of their Sachem George Washington Plunkitt about good graft and bad graft. Good graft enabled the construction of roads repairs of streets public building projects that were needed bridges tunnels etc. In short they enhanced or helped the city. Bad graft was like stealing the tin roof of the town orphanage to sell it to a metal dealer! Boston had many improvements under Curley but plenty of payoffs. Yet he was a master at manipulating public opinion. The Irish and other ethnic groups including Jews and AfricanAmericans became his voting blocks because the conservative opposition was hidebound old Puritan  Yankee and old money and antiminority. It worked like a charm for Boss Curley. It got him to the state house. It was only towards the end of his career when he got involved in a postal fraud that he went to prison for two years. He left prison and was reelected Mayor of Boston!The novel emphasized the more hamish elements of Curley's success. His ability to have loyal lieutenants here played by Pat O'Brien Ricardo Cortez James Gleason and Ed Brophy as his gopher Ditto and to have loyal friends even including opponents like Anna Lee Wallace Ford as a crank political rival Frank McHugh and Jane Darwell. Even some of his critics like and respect him even if they don't always support him such as the Cardinal Donald Crisp and the local Episcopal Bishop Basil Ruysdael. Tracy basks in this warmth as well as that of his nephew Jeffey Hunter. It's good he has it as his son Arthur Walsh is a total washout as an emotional support the boy just likes dating pretty girls going golfing and hearing jazz. Tracy invites Hunter to follow the last campaign. He is smart enough to realize that this mayoralty campaign is the last of the old time political clubhouse type elections. Tracy has noted the rising media of television and radio and knows in a few years they will dictate the political future. Ford captures this horrible future well showing the inept wooden candidate McCloskey with his wooden wife and kids four of them and a rented dog they don't like on television. It's a rich film and a warm one. The villains are evenly dispensed  Basil Rathbone as banker Norman Cass John Carridine as editor Amos Force Willis Bouchey as Roger Segrue are a trio of types but each is different. Rathbone is a patrician and dislikes Tracy for his background he represents the loss of the patrician class's power to the lower classes. Carridine simply hates him for a piece of bigoted history on his own family's part. Segrue demonstrates that intolerance can be found in the Catholics as well as the Protestants. But there are differences. Rathbone fed up with his ally Carridine at one point for his suggesting the banker could have put pressure on Ruysdael on a political matter shoots a cutting statement that if it was up to Carridine a former member of the Ku Klux Klan they'd be burning a cross in the bishop's front lawn!The film ends with Bouchey suggesting that if Skeffington had it all to do he would do it differently. Skeffington smiles and says Like Hell I would!. When the novel came out James Michael Curley was still alive and angry...he threatened to sue. But then he noticed the public liked this friendlier image of himself from the novel. He dropped the lawsuit and wrote his memoirs. He entitled the memoirs I'D DO IT AGAIN!".

After that effort they went their separate ways Ford usually directing at 20th Century Fox Republic and other studios RKO for MARY OF Scotland but rarely at MGM. And when he was developing into Hollywood's greatest director Tracy after an initially unrewarding period at Fox went to MGM and became their leading actorstar. But neither managed to find a project to do with the other. Then in 1958 Ford approached Tracy to play Mayor Frank Skeffington the hero of Edwin O'Connor's novel THE LAST HURRAH. This time with both director and actor at their peaks the result was far more memorable than UP THE RIVER had been.O'Connor's novel a best seller in it's day was a fictionalization of parts of the career of James Michael Curley a man who became synonymous with the city of Boston. Boston's laws were peculiar regarding electing Mayors. After some bad experiences in the 19th and early 20th Century the city decided that Mayors could not have consecutive terms in office  that they could serve as Mayor frequently but like Grover Cleveland's two terms as President not one term following another. This was okay with Curley who ended up the most reelected Mayor in Boston serving four terms each four years in length over a period of two and a half decades with a two year term as Governor of Massachusetts as well. A remarkable career for his day or any day. He was corrupt as they come  but he always pointed out that his corruption benefited the public usually it did. It was like the old Tammany Hall dictum of their Sachem George Washington Plunkitt about good graft and bad graft. Good graft enabled the construction of roads repairs of streets public building projects that were needed bridges tunnels etc. In short they enhanced or helped the city. Bad graft was like stealing the tin roof of the town orphanage to sell it to a metal dealer! Boston had many improvements under Curley but plenty of payoffs. Yet he was a master at manipulating public opinion. The Irish and other ethnic groups including Jews and AfricanAmericans became his voting blocks because the conservative opposition was hidebound old Puritan  Yankee and old money and antiminority. It worked like a charm for Boss Curley. It got him to the state house. It was only towards the end of his career when he got involved in a postal fraud that he went to prison for two years. He left prison and was reelected Mayor of Boston!The novel emphasized the more hamish elements of Curley's success. His ability to have loyal lieutenants here played by Pat O'Brien Ricardo Cortez James Gleason and Ed Brophy as his gopher Ditto and to have loyal friends even including opponents like Anna Lee Wallace Ford as a crank political rival Frank McHugh and Jane Darwell. Even some of his critics like and respect him even if they don't always support him such as the Cardinal Donald Crisp and the local Episcopal Bishop Basil Ruysdael. Tracy basks in this warmth as well as that of his nephew Jeffey Hunter. It's good he has it as his son Arthur Walsh is a total washout as an emotional support the boy just likes dating pretty girls going golfing and hearing jazz. Tracy invites Hunter to follow the last campaign. He is smart enough to realize that this mayoralty campaign is the last of the old time political clubhouse type elections. Tracy has noted the rising media of television and radio and knows in a few years they will dictate the political future. Ford captures this horrible future well showing the inept wooden candidate McCloskey with his wooden wife and kids four of them and a rented dog they don't like on television. It's a rich film and a warm one. The villains are evenly dispensed  Basil Rathbone as banker Norman Cass John Carridine as editor Amos Force Willis Bouchey as Roger Segrue are a trio of types but each is different. Rathbone is a patrician and dislikes Tracy for his background he represents the loss of the patrician class's power to the lower classes. Carridine simply hates him for a piece of bigoted history on his own family's part. Segrue demonstrates that intolerance can be found in the Catholics as well as the Protestants. But there are differences. Rathbone fed up with his ally Carridine at one point for his suggesting the banker could have put pressure on Ruysdael on a political matter shoots a cutting statement that if it was up to Carridine a former member of the Ku Klux Klan they'd be burning a cross in the bishop's front lawn!The film ends with Bouchey suggesting that if Skeffington had it all to do he would do it differently. Skeffington smiles and says Like Hell I would!. When the novel came out James Michael Curley was still alive and angry...he threatened to sue. But then he noticed the public liked this friendlier image of himself from the novel. He dropped the lawsuit and wrote his memoirs. He entitled the memoirs I'D DO IT AGAIN!";

I would like to call attention to two actors who typified the cultural divide that James Michael Curley never attempted to bridge in his lifetime unlike in this film. Willis Bouchey playing Roger Sugrue disparagingly referred to as the Papal Knight is this rabidly bigoted Roman Catholic who is forever finding fault with the rest of humanity and criticizing those of his fellow Catholics who are not as good as he. He nearly has a stroke after seeing a Monsignor played by Ken Curtis on TV playing golf with a rabbi. No wonder Donald Crisp playing the Cardinal refers to him as that horrible man Roger Sugrue.And the other side of the coin is John Carradine playing Amos Force the descendant of old line Puritans who is as bigoted in his way as Roger Sugrue is in his. It's alluded to that back in the 1920s Carradine was in the Ku Klux Klan and you can believe it from Carradine's portrayal.Bouchey and Carradine are the two best in a cast that is saturated with John Ford favorites.

Please forgive my relating all of this similarity to Chicago. Enough of this already so  OUR STORY Long time Mayor Frank Skeffington Spencer Tracy of an unnamed Bostoniantype Big City is facing an election after being in office of one form or another most of his life. Being an old pro and facing challenge from College Boyupstart Kevin McCluskey Charles B. Fitzsimmons there is nothing that seems extraordinary about this election. So we are to follow Mr. Skeffington all day long during the last stretch of the election.We see it all through the eyes of Adam Caulfield Jeffrey Hunter a newspaper man who is assigned to cover the Campaign of his somewhat estranged Uncle. In addition to the Public Man we get to see the day to day functions of the Skeffington no one ever sees.In addition to regular duties as the City's Chief Executive All of us are present when he decides on who a new statue in city park shall be made. The Mayor brings in a host of mourners for a socially solitary constituent and gets the widow a rock bottom price by using a little City Hall Arm Twisting on Mortician Johnny Degnan gently reminding him that his business licensing is up for renewal soon. He also garners support he needs from the City's Bluebloods by appointing Amos Force Jr. O.Z. Whitehead the nitwit sissified son of Amos Force John Carradine to be the new Fire Chief complete with Black Mail Photos.The campaign progresses and the public turns Frank out of office. In making concession speech he announces his new campaign for Governor which would go unrequited as he is stricken with a highly debilitating stroke. Confined to his bed all of his political allies and some of the old rivals come by to pay their respects. Frank dies.Director John Ford took an excellent adaptation of the novel and transformed it into great film. Use of the archivallike effect of the Black  White was well executed and effective. Ford  writers Edwin O'Connell novel  Frank S. Nugent screenplay use ironic twist of having Frank Skeffington Jr. Arthur Walsh characterized as a useless goodtime Prodigal Son type having no interest in his Father's Mayoralty or his declining physical condition.One thing for sure though is that Mr. John Ford put together a super talented cast some of the regulars others working with him for the first time. These include Pat O'Brien Basil Rathbone Diane Foster Donald Crisp Frank McHugh James Flavin James Gleason Ed Brophy Basil Ruysdael Willis Bouchey Ricardo Cortez Wallace Ford Carleton Young Frank Albertson Edmund Lowe William Leslie Anna Lee and Ken Curtis. Jane Darwell Ruth Warren Helen Westscott Mimi Doyle Danny Borzage William Forrest Frank Sully Charles Sullivan and others too numerous to name here.NOTE  The NINA stands for No Irish Need Applysigns which were commonplace in our big cities in the mid to late 19th Century.".

He was struck down by the bullet of assassin Giuseppe Zangara in Miami Florida February 15 1933. This was during an appearance with Presidentelect Franklin D. Roosevelt. The assumption was that the bullet was meant for Roosevelt but nobody knows for sure.Others to ascend the Throne of the OrganizationMachine were Edward J. Kelly 193347 Martin H. Kennelly 194751 Michael A. Bilandic 197679 Jane M. Byrne 197983 Harold L. Washington 198387 Eugene Sawyer 198789 and Richard M. Daley 1989Present. Please forgive my relating all of this similarity to Chicago. Enough of this already so  OUR STORY Long time Mayor Frank Skeffington Spencer Tracy of an unnamed Bostoniantype Big City is facing an election after being in office of one form or another most of his life. Being an old pro and facing challenge from College Boyupstart Kevin McCluskey Charles B. Fitzsimmons there is nothing that seems extraordinary about this election. So we are to follow Mr. Skeffington all day long during the last stretch of the election.We see it all through the eyes of Adam Caulfield Jeffrey Hunter a newspaper man who is assigned to cover the Campaign of his somewhat estranged Uncle. In addition to the Public Man we get to see the day to day functions of the Skeffington no one ever sees.In addition to regular duties as the City's Chief Executive All of us are present when he decides on who a new statue in city park shall be made. The Mayor brings in a host of mourners for a socially solitary constituent and gets the widow a rock bottom price by using a little City Hall Arm Twisting on Mortician Johnny Degnan gently reminding him that his business licensing is up for renewal soon. He also garners support he needs from the City's Bluebloods by appointing Amos Force Jr. O.Z. Whitehead the nitwit sissified son of Amos Force John Carradine to be the new Fire Chief complete with Black Mail Photos.The campaign progresses and the public turns Frank out of office. In making concession speech he announces his new campaign for Governor which would go unrequited as he is stricken with a highly debilitating stroke. Confined to his bed all of his political allies and some of the old rivals come by to pay their respects. Frank dies.Director John Ford took an excellent adaptation of the novel and transformed it into great film. Use of the archivallike effect of the Black  White was well executed and effective. Ford  writers Edwin O'Connell novel  Frank S. Nugent screenplay use ironic twist of having Frank Skeffington Jr. Arthur Walsh characterized as a useless goodtime Prodigal Son type having no interest in his Father's Mayoralty or his declining physical condition.One thing for sure though is that Mr. John Ford put together a super talented cast some of the regulars others working with him for the first time. These include Pat O'Brien Basil Rathbone Diane Foster Donald Crisp Frank McHugh James Flavin James Gleason Ed Brophy Basil Ruysdael Willis Bouchey Ricardo Cortez Wallace Ford Carleton Young Frank Albertson Edmund Lowe William Leslie Anna Lee and Ken Curtis. Jane Darwell Ruth Warren Helen Westscott Mimi Doyle Danny Borzage William Forrest Frank Sully Charles Sullivan and others too numerous to name here.NOTE  The NINA stands for No Irish Need Applysigns which were commonplace in our big cities in the mid to late 19th Century.";

Well ... there's a bit of political social and cultural history in this film and in the novel by Edwin O'Connor. It is a commentary from Ford's point of view and with the customary Ford schmaltz on big city politics in the first half of the 20th Century. Although the film never mentions the locale it is Boston. The novelist O'Connor a New Englander from Rhode Island admitted that the Frank Skeffington character was based roughly on James Michael Curley who served as mayor of Boston four different times and as governor or Massachusetts and as a Congressman from Massachusetts. Curley wrote his autobiography in 1957 a year after O'Connor published his novel. Ford uses many of the stock company actors which he regularly used in the 1950s and '60s. But Spencer Tracy is splendid as Skeffington. When I later read the novel I thought of Tracy as Skeffington and I constantly heard the harp music theme used in the film in my mind. Ditto Ditto Ditto. How do you thank a man for a million laughs?".

All the elements for a masterpiece are in place the stock company Frank Nugent manning the screenplay the Irish milieu and the most Fordian line ever  there's only one way to describe the candidate and that is that he was victorious in defeat. So Wha'happen? This is a mediocre film that should nonetheless be analyzed shot by shot. The last hurrah is Ford's not Skeffington's and I wish I was enough of a theorist to go into every detail of how that becomes obvious over the course of the film. I once heard that the film critic Serge Daney said something to the effect that every film is a documentary of its own creation and that is so true here. The sight of John Carradine alone evokes a whole world and life the seven films of Ford's he participated in in the thirties the fact that he hadn't been seen in one in almost 20 years. His scenes are a meditation on the ineffable quality known as stardom for all his sepulchral presence he can't hold a screen the way Spencer Tracy can and their moments together are a battle between the magnificent character actor who has never and will never rise above that status except when he's with Edgar G. Ulmer naturally and the star. Ford understands all of this  all of this and more. What is being mourned  and make no mistake it's being mourned way before Skeffington's actual death  in this film? Is it the death of a man or of a way of life? The way Skeffington ritually changes the flowers under his dead wife's portrait daily tells us that these people are already in mourning for themselves. The wake scene for the nondescript ne'er  do  well seems disproportionally long but as the film progresses you understand that it functions as a foreshadowing of the film's central ritual. All this is great. But making all the sons into buffoons is a cheap kneejerk statement on the generation which is replacing these dinosaurs and it is impossible to get a sense of how McCluskey's manipulation of the media this of course represents the modern world leads to his victory given the fact that the one time we see him on TV he seems like a totally unlovable clown. Was Ford going for Nixon's Checkers speech here? Nixon's nervousness and uncomfortableness read to many as a form of truth and his we're not giving up that dog no matter what anyone says read as a particularly bumbling form of honesty. Ford should have at least shown us that. This way the deck is so stacked that it's impossible to care. Andrew Sarris was right Sturges director of The Great McGinty shoulda taken this one.".

	schema:headline " Skeffington's Last Hurrah!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Last Hurrah is John Ford's fine film about Frank Skeffington's fifth and final attempt to win the mayoralty of a New England City. The story is loosely based on the life and times of former Boston mayor James Curley. Although Boston isn't identified per se several discreet references are made to it throughout the film.Spencer Tracy heads up a large cast which includes many familiar faces from the 1930s as well as members of the John Ford stock company. Tracy dominates the proceedings as we follow him through his fifth campaign to be elected mayor. Along the way we see his modus operandi as he greets his constituents attends a wake confronts his political enemies and deals with his personal problems as they arise.Skeffington draws his nephew Adam Caulfield Jeffrey Hunter into his circle with the apparent goal of eventually passing the torch to him. He treats Caulfield like the son he wishes he had rather than his actual son playboy Frank Skeffington Jr. Arthur Walsh. Caulfield is married to the daughter Dianne Foster of his long time opponent Roget Sugrue Willis Boucher with whom there is no love lost.Banker Norman Cass Basil Rathbone and newspaper editor Amos Force John Carradineteam up to block Skeffington's reelection. They put up their money and their own candidate Kevin McClusky Charles B. Fitzsimmons  Maureen O'Hara's brother to run against him.On Skeffington's team are secretary Dan Herlihy William Leslie his personal assistant Winslow Carleton Young and his back room boys Gorman Pat O'Brien Weinberg Ricardo Cortez Gillen James Gleason and gofer Ditto Boland James Brophy.Others in the rather large cast include Donald Crisp as Cardinal Burke Ken Curtis as Monseignor Killian Basil Ruysdael as Bishop Gardner Wallace Ford as mayoralty candidate Hennessy and Frank McHugh as Festus Garvey another opponent.As always Ford injects some humor into the story. There is a hilarious encounter at a wake between Hunter and Ford favorite Jane Darwell. Also the scene where Skeffington anoints Norman Cass Jr. O. Z. Whitehead as Fire Commissioner is hilarious. Look for Ford perennial stock company members Anna Lee and Jack Pennick as well as Bob Sweeney and Richard Deacon in other parts.I have to take issue with the characterization of the Kevin McClusky character. Ford makes him such a buffoon that it's unfathomable that such a person could be elected mayor of a New England city.Spencer Tracy as always makes this film well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes there can be too much of a good thing. In this case it is the presence of too many characters played by too many veteran stars in cameos some of them off screen for so long that it is difficult to recognize them. Its a matter of oh that's funny bald guy Edward Brophy and squeaky voiced Frank McHugh. I didn't realize that they were still alive let alone still working. Jane Darwell still movin' around as a townsperson who attends every funeral. At least modern audiences knew her from her cameo as the bird woman in Mary Poppins. But what worked in the comedy classic It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World is intrusive here. Tons of characters in a novel can't bring consistent flow to a two hour movie without some confusion no matter how well meaning the script writers was.There is tons of potential for great drama in this political drama of devoted public servant Spencer Tracy running for reelection for mayor even though he's also been governor and suffers from health issues. Tracy is both public hero and a bit of a bully to get what he wants and this has made him both loyal followers and powerful enemies including an aging cardinal and a former Klu Klux Klan member whom Tracy claims had to drop out because he was too cheap to buy his own sheet. Director John Ford utilizes many of his old acting stable including Basil Rathbone Anna Lee and Ricardo Cortez.What is ironic about this movie is the timing of seeing it again just as scandal rocks American politics all over particularly New York City as candidates for mayor are raked over the coals in the press. In this movie Tracy's rival is a buffoon a real weiner if you pardon the pun. In a sense this makes a mockery out of politics but in movies politicians were often skewered and roasted. By the late 50's however the McCarthy scandals had made politics being taken much more seriously and later dramas like Advise and Consent and The Best Man would play on that change. The presence of the amazing Mr. Tracy is certainly worth its prestige but too many things fall in the way of making this the masterpiece it could have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw political boss described of Tracy's character in THE LAST HURRAH I really wasn't sure where director John Ford was going with this. The two words together had me literally leaving it as my own last hurrah of the numerous films I've recorded and watched during Spencer Tracy's turn as October 2012's TCM Star of the Month. My queue is quite full but proportionately I've seen few duds this last month so I gave it a shot vs. deleting it. I'm so glad I went with my faith in Tracy's choice as an actor! He rarely went wrong. My awe of him has increased tenfold in the last 5 weeks. He was a rare great and this rare film didn't disappoint.Also this underrated gem is one of those movies that benefits greatly from the still intact Hays Code in the late 1950's. That opinion is due to the subtle mysteries and implied allegations mixed in with the tense relationships and amusing political tactics that keep us intrigued and entertained throughout. Too much information from either side would leave us with a completely different film as often happens in modern day films. I loved the winding way the story unfolded and left me guessing as to how it could possibly play out.As it turns out Ford in his unique Ford way knew exactly what he was doing. He made a film about intriguing characters...plain and simple. This is no soap opera and there were no big Indian battles set in this quaint 1950's New England Town. However this film had all of the entertaining qualities of Ford's character driven westerns with all of the complexities that arise off the battlefield too. It literally was one last hurrah as some of the fine supporting cast retired or died within a few years. What a great way to go out on a fine film led by Spencer Tracy and directed by John Ford! I'm glad these two greats matched up along with the stellar character actor cast to make what was one of Tracy's greatest films of his last decade and of his career. Many think those films were made with Stanley Kramer but I actually prefer this one to those last major statement films which Tracy made with Stanley Kramer. There's nothing like infusing interesting characters with high drama and light comedy. Not to diminish the importance of the Kramer films. It's just what I prefer as a viewer. Make time to see this film if you have a fondness for any of the cast and crew or want to see a great political drama. It will be 2 hours you'll be glad you invested.".

Winning twice in 1937 for Captain's Courageous and in 1938 for Boys Town he was the first actor to win backtoback Oscars.In 1958 two films both based upon best selling novels were released. The first of these was a screen adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea the story of a lone Cuban fisherman and his solitary fight to 'land the big one.'The second film was a transcription of Edwin O'Connor's look at IrishAmerican politics in The Last Hurrah! Tracy received an Oscar nomination for the former but should he have been honoured for the latter instead?In The Old Man and the Sea Tracy is alone for most of the film's 86 minute running time. A glorious opportunity to show off one's acting chops having that much screen time to yourself is also a major challenge because it requires the actor to dig deep to maintain our interest since there is no one off of whom he can play. With The Last Hurrah! the opposite is true as Tracy is surrounded by a veteran group of scenestealer's Basil Rathbone John Carradine Edward Brophy Donald Crisp Jane Darwell and Anna Lee just to name a few who challenge him and us to keep the focus where it belongs. In each film loneliness and isolation is a central metaphor. In the Hemingway story the old Cuban fisherman in his rickety old boat must land 'the big fish' alone and then alone fight off 'the sharks' who want to rob him of it. As O'Connor's Mayor Frank Skeffington he is still alone and isolated from the modern and crass world of his son and political opponents plus he is also unable to give up the old ways that propelled and kept in office even though he knows the days for those old ways are numbered. That he becomes all tooacutely aware of the accuracy of his perceptions is brilliantly confirmed in one of the cinema's most stunning shots Skeffington's walk home alone after the results of the election are in.For this viewer at least Hemingway's old man is a skeletal boring old man thus robbing Tracy gifted actor though he was of the tools he needed to make him cinematically interesting. O'Connor's Frank Skeffington on the other hand is much more finally nuanced. A flesh and blood skin and bone sinew and tissue firebrand he is at times almost repulsively sentimental harsh kind churlish generous vindictive and opportunistic. In other words there is real meat here with Tracy the consummate actor making a feast of it. Was Spencer Tracy nominated for the wrong film in 1958? Yes I would say he was even though I doubt he would have defeated winner David Niven for his brilliant turn in Separate Tables.".

I must admit that I was pretty letdown with this film considering the talent involved. When you have Ford directing actors such as Tracy and Hunter then I expected a lot more than what was actually delivered. The supporting cast contains brilliant actors such as John Carradine Basil Rathbone Dianne Foster Pat O'Brien Wallace Ford Donald Crisp Ricardo Cortez and Frank McHugh. There are signs a greatness throughout this film but they're often followed up with overly talky scenes that just drag on for no reason at all. Ford is trying to make all sorts of points about the political game but when he speaks these points he just keeps on and on. There's a scene inside a funeral that has political motivations behind it and this scene is the perfect example of a message being beaten to death and dragged down into boredom. There are several great sequences including one where Tracy blackmails Rathbone into doing some good for the city and there's another great scene when Tracy busts in on some bank managers who are using race to work against him. Tracy is good in his role but I don't think this is among his best performances. Hunter delivers a nice performance as well but I found his role to be rather underwritten. I think Carradine steals the film as the racist newspaper editor who holds a grudge against Tracy. All in all this is an interesting movie but I don't think it takes off the way it should have and considering the talent involved the movie should have been much better.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies that I confidently predict will wind up being considered much better as time goes on than the critics said at its inception. It's especially funny and biting on occasion if you happened to have lived through the first rush of AIDS deaths and the fear that engendered. This whole movie is a send up of that and revels in the idea that sex and life go on even in the aftermath of terror. The Hoedown fantasy sequence with its overtones of Busby Berkley and Oklahoma is hysterically funny. As for the acting it's purposely broad with Patrick Steward playing against type both in his role of Picard and in his many Shakespearean ones. Steve Weber is a hoot and there is no doubt in my mind that the other actors had a blast working in this flick. Many of them appear to have that look you see when actors are performing for their peers and enjoying every moment of it. The Pink Panthers moment alone lets Stewart shine. Are there flaws in the movie. Yup! The dialogue is sometimes stilted and jokes occasionally are dumped in rather than flowing from the plot but overall it's witty biting and downright rapierlike on more than one occasion. All in all Jeffrey is fun and worth an hour or so of your life.".

The characters we meet are intriguing and though the 2dimensional stereotypes are made for laughs we get the feeling that we are laughing at the strange mix of truth and falsehood many of the stereotypes possess we are laughing not at people who are flaming but at characters who are exuberant joyous people trying to squeeze every bit of joy and delight that they can out of every moment.I won't spoil the journey through this story with any specifics let's just say that Jeffrey doesn't quite get it. It is both painful and joyful at turns watching the character navigate through a turning point in his life. I laughed I got choked up and then I laughed again and again ad infinitum.

Rest assured this movie will keep you interested not only with its story line but with the surprise cameo appearances by some of today's best actors. Patrick Stewart gives an outstanding performance as Sterling however it is Michael T. Weiss who steals the show!

His direction really destroyed some of the jokes. Other than that this is an OK movie. Michael T. Weiss is beautiful and hunky and one hell of an actor. Patrick Stewart played a gay older man to perfectionI couldn't believe it when I found out he was straight. Also the scenes with Olympia Dukakis Sigourney Weaver and Nathan Lane are great!

To sum it up it shows how important friends are in our time of need. This is one movie I can watch over and over and I have seen it probably two dozen times or more. The writing acting and music are flawless you'll laugh you'll cry you'll love it! This is the one single movie I can quote the most amount of lines from.".

	schema:reviewBody "The world is a scary place and serious contemplation of that could be enough to cause anyone to shut down. So what happens when in the face of the AIDS tragedy one handsome young gay man decides that he'd rather be celibate than risk it all? Worse yet what happens when he then meets the man of his dreams who turns out to be HIV positive? Rent this little gem to find out.Jeffrey Steven Weber is a handsome young single gay man in New York City who is letting his fear of AIDS run his life. In fact he is so afraid of AIDS that he has decided that celibacy is the only way to protect himself from it. And considering the kinds of sexual encounters we see him engaged in during the opening sequence of the film that may not be such a bad idea. His closest friends Sterling Patrick Stewart a wise old decorator and his partner Darius Bryan Batta a dancer in the musical Cats don't necessarily agree with Jeffrey but they remain supportive. And then one day at the gym Jeffrey meets trainer Steve Howard Michael T. Weiss a very handsome man who is very interested in Jeffrey. After agonizing over the decision Jeffrey agrees to go out with Steve but before their first date Steve tells Jeffrey that he is HIV positive and Jeffrey cancels. As the movie goes on Jeffrey experiences several life changing events which cause him to question the wisdom of his insistence on celibacy and to wonder if a life without risks is a life worth living.It's rather a delightful script full of wit and silliness and flights of fancy. But underneath it all there is a seriousness to the message which only makes the comedy that much funnier. And its message about taking risks in life is one that should resonate universally.The acting was superb. Batt's uneducated kept dancer is nicely done in that we see that he's not stupid he's just not sophisticated. Stewart camps it up with hilarious results and yet his serious scenes show just how much range and talent this fine actor has. Weiss gives a nice performance as a man with a confident exterior who is still quite vulnerable underneath. Weber plays Jeffrey's uncertainty very well and is surprisingly good as a gay man.Fun little film that shouldn't be taken too seriously but which still has a serious message. And one well worth watching.".

He decides to work out instead. Meeting Mr. Exactly Right in the gym gives him pause though. Especially when the guy is the delectable Steve Michael T.Weiss all muscle and chiseled grin. Jeffrey's friends advise him to reconsider his celibacy and give it a go. It takes Jeffrey around 1 hour and 20 minutes of screentime to do so. Had he succumbed to Steve right away there would have been no movie! There is a sitcomlike feel to this story obstructions and cracks are neatly wallpapered over in the name of lighthearted comedy. Darius' angelic reappearance towards the end smacks of opting for the easy way out. How else would Jeffrey have seen the error of his ways? It's the least convincing scene in the movie. Still everything else is both funny and touching. The fantasy gameshow is nice the Hoe Down for AIDS is a scathingly funny pisstake on charityevents while Sterling's banter and relentless quips are wonderfulMartha Stewart says that as long as you can make a nice dried flower arrangement  nothing else matters!!Darius is a believable character Steve is the hunk of the year and although Steven Weber doesn't set the room on fire as Jeffrey I found him to be exactly in character. After all Jeffrey is SUPPOSED to be a rather ordinary guy. Why Steve would go for him though is a bit of a mystery. Their subsequent affair would make for an interesting sequel. It would probably all turn sour in the end. Then again...".

Jeffrey's pain is that he's sworn off sex altogether. About this time he meets the Man of His Dreams Michael T. Weiss oozing dark masculinity. The catch this Man is HIVpositive. So the dilemma lies to be with a man who may or may not survive such a deadly disease and risk his own life since a moment of passion may be the dividing line between life and death or to turn around and continue looking for Mr. Goodbar even when Mr. Goodbar is right there for the asking.The premise makes for a a story that should be much much darker and introspective but Paul Rudnick has decided to make it a romantic comedy and it works for the most part. Again and going back to the top of this article it's the supporting characters and bit players who make the adventures of Jeffrey worth experiencing consider one surreal scene where Jeffrey calls his parents who are extremely implausibly hilariously in tune with the times when in fact they shouldn't and go into frank discussions about Jeffrey's lack of a sex life. Looking at them all 1950s excess yammering in gay lingo is enough to have anyone rolling on the floor.Other scenes are of equal hilarity Patrick Stewart interrupting Kevin Nealon as a reporter announcing the sex change of a bit player then unknown Gregory Ibarra whose mother Olympia Dukakis has a whale of a time posing for cameras and Nathan Lane as a priest who unsuccessfully tries to seduce Weber at church in a rather bizarre moment. Of the cast however Bryan Batt is the one who almost walks away with the movie as Stewart's lover also dying of AIDS and has some pretty outlandish scenes which make his character memorable. And of course any movie that lampoons Mother Theresa has to have my vote especially when it manages to pepper an erstwhile campy romance scene. One of the better entries of the Nineties not to feature gay men as unable to have sex lives and wallowing in corners and a hoot to watch.".

I have seen a few other movies that focused on gay relationships but they didn't seem real to me. They seemed to focus on either the stereotypical lifestyle on portraying them as victims of society or were overdramatized. Watching Jeffrey allowed me to feel the emotions of the characters and get pulled into their lives and issues and feel their highs and lows right along with them. The characters were going through everyday emotional relationship ordeals that I could relate to as a heterosexual as well as some specific issues that homosexuals face. I highly recommend this movie...it is interesting and different. SPOILER AHEAD! SPOILER AHEAD!I've never seen a movie before where I was passionately rooting for two men to get together and kiss. It's not because I have a closed mind but I was never able to connect to the characters enough before.END OF SPOILER".

Both stories come across via the broad strokes of a comic book come to life. And indeed one wonders that Frank Loesser and Abe Burrows couldn't take Jeffrey and work it over into a '90s Gays and Dolls without too much trouble.  The movie already has its start in that direction with the rodeo dance number serving as the dream ballet sequence requisite of every selfrespecting stage musical.The point I'm making is that every fictionalized reality an oxymoron if there ever was one requires to some extent or another a willing suspension of disbelief.  Watch Jeffrey with the same perspective you sat in the audience and enjoyed Guys and Dolls with  Don't look too hard for subtlety here.  Just sit back relax and enjoy the story.

It's a very original idea which is rare amongst family films these days which all seem to be remakes or rehashed films. The only real downside to this film keeping in mind of course that it is aimed towards kids is that some of the dialogue is really cheezy and unbelievable The 10 yearold I was watching over while watching this film kept said 'gimme a break' and 'yeah right' at a couple of points in the film...and it's one of her favs The effects were fun Martin Short was funny most of the time...he tends to overdo it at certain moments and Amanda Plummer really shines..all in all a good film to watch with one's children. 710.".

From the opening scenes Murrey shows us what kind on stooge he really is and it just develops from there as the film moves through it's plot. It's not a bad plot as family movies go. Kathleen Turner puts in a wicked performance as a villainous witch. The special effects are good and used in a way that compliments the funniness of the scenes and aren't just there to dazzle or put there arbitrarily. I saw a comment on another Short movie that fits the bill here too. I'm going to change it while keeping the spirit of it intact. If you don't get the meaning of slapstick humor then there's nothing to get just ...let it happen go rent a George Carlin standup video instead.

With his next audition he is ready to throw it all in and go work in his cousin's rendering plant on Nebraska. Anabel wishes for her fairy godmother to help them but because the majority of them are tied up at the annual conference she has to make do with the failing trainee Murray. She quickly finds that Murray is not quite as good as he has told her and most of their time is spent trying to correct his mistakes. Things are more complicated when they are pursued by witch Claudia who has trapped all the other godmothers and only needs Murray's wand to finalise her attempts at total power.Although I taped this film in error thinking it was something else I still ended up watching it as it was a bonus family film to act as distraction. Normally I wouldn't bother with such a thing but on this occasion I did and the end product was a basic but quite entertaining film that had enough to stop it being boring for me and enough silliness and energy to make it enjoyable for children. The narrative is a bit messy for a while it is about Murray's weakness as a Fairy Godmother but then it becomes a big finish around a plot by Claudia to get all the power for herself. The two strands don't sit well together at all and the latter just feels like it has been added to bulk the former out and give it more impact as a dramatic finish. However it is quite amusing along the way and children will enjoy the mix of silliness effects and magic.The cast are OK and are a good part of this working. Short is a bit irritating but he does overplay the silliness well enough to provide distraction. Turner seems to enjoy herself even if her role is a bit smaller than I'm sure she expected meanwhile Plummer does her usual slightly unhinged thing but this time as a dog. Pastorelli has little to do but Wilson and Capra are both engaging without being like the very sickly AllAmerican kids that US family films can be dripping with.Overall this is a family film and therefore not the sort of thing any adult would really chose to watch alone because there isn't much just for them even if it isn't bad as such. The energy silliness and pace of the film will make it a winner for children and it serves well as a distraction if hardly a great film for the ages.".

Pastorelli has little to do but Wilson and Capra are both engaging without being like the very sickly AllAmerican kids that US family films can be dripping with.Overall this is a family film and therefore not the sort of thing any adult would really chose to watch alone because there isn't much just for them even if it isn't bad as such. The energy silliness and pace of the film will make it a winner for children and it serves well as a distraction if hardly a great film for the ages.";

The special effects are decent there is some nice photography and costumes and the pacing is good nice and skippy as I like it. Plus there are some fun moments one of the funniest ones was the froginyourthroat scene gross but quite amusing.The acting wasn't that bad either. Martin Short does overact a bit but he is clearly having fun as Murray. Mara Wilson who I really like gives a typically charming performance. Robert Pastorelli is giving little to do though but Ruby Dee and Francis Capra give entertaining performances. But for me it was Kathaleen Turner who stole the show as her performance is delightfully wicked and so captivating as the villainess of the piece. I must also say the music was surprisingly excellent. All in all this is a nice underrated film. 710 Bethany Cox".

However I could have done without the 'comedy stylings' of Martin Short at his hyperactive worst or Amanda Plumming who chews one too many shoes for my liking in this role.If you're babysitting one night and you find yourself shoved in front of the box with this playing I'm afraid the only consolation is some good oneliners from Turner and a few mildly diverting magic spells. Otherwise prepare of a bit of a long haul.

	schema:reviewBody "A Simple Wish 1997 Dir Michael Ritchie  Cast Martin Short Mara Wilson Kathleen Turner Amanda Plummer Robert Pastorelli Simple film much like many of its kind but it contains glorious visual images that are amongst its few praises. The title symbolizes complications. It stars Martin Short as a fairy godmother who accidentally turns Mara Wilson's father into a statue. They must retrieve the wand from an evil witch by midnight. Simple plot with numerous happenings that showcase massive production values. Unfortunately it doesn't present screenplay value. Children may not relate to Broadway musicals and auditions. Then again what element of this film can a kid possible relate too? Director Michael Ritchie has fun with the magical elements. This is somewhat similar to one of his earlier films The Golden Child. Short is basically the bunt of a bad joke looking ridiculous and Wilson provides the ever familiar wholesome innocence. Kathleen Turner is a superb actress but playing this witch is so beneath her talent. Amanda Plummer plays her sidekick who belongs on a dog leash and marched around central park. Robert Pastorelli plays Wilson's father who more or less should be a statue considering the role. Are adults suppose to sit through this with their children and suffer along with the talent involved? Satire of fairy tales that had potential yet one might wish for a better screenplay. Score 4  10".

	onyx:emotionText "A Simple Wish 1997 Dir Michael Ritchie  Cast Martin Short Mara Wilson Kathleen Turner Amanda Plummer Robert Pastorelli Simple film much like many of its kind but it contains glorious visual images that are amongst its few praises. The title symbolizes complications. It stars Martin Short as a fairy godmother who accidentally turns Mara Wilson's father into a statue. They must retrieve the wand from an evil witch by midnight. Simple plot with numerous happenings that showcase massive production values. Unfortunately it doesn't present screenplay value. Children may not relate to Broadway musicals and auditions. Then again what element of this film can a kid possible relate too? Director Michael Ritchie has fun with the magical elements. This is somewhat similar to one of his earlier films The Golden Child. Short is basically the bunt of a bad joke looking ridiculous and Wilson provides the ever familiar wholesome innocence. Kathleen Turner is a superb actress but playing this witch is so beneath her talent. Amanda Plummer plays her sidekick who belongs on a dog leash and marched around central park. Robert Pastorelli plays Wilson's father who more or less should be a statue considering the role. Are adults suppose to sit through this with their children and suffer along with the talent involved? Satire of fairy tales that had potential yet one might wish for a better screenplay. Score 4  10";

We wait for Dev Anand and Pran to reunite all along the film and then there is very limited interaction between them for all our wait.Nonetheless it is a must watch.";

I don't think many people know who Padma Khanna ispoor man's Mumtaz but her sexy dance will blow you away. Trust me it is unique and has never been done before or since. And then there is that beautiful song  Babul Pyaree  every daughter's memorable song. One of the most heart pulling song ever pictured. Another favorite song of mine is the bhakti song  Govind Bolo Hari gopal bolo.There are other memorable movie moments like when Dev Anand says that he has been following the daughter so that she would lead him to her father only to realize that the daughter was also trying desperately to reach her father.If you like Dev Anand and Pran's incredible voice plus some good acting this movie is a must see. Trust me you will rewind the tape to watch Padma Khanna. Little known fact Dara Singh's brother has a small role in this movie.".
