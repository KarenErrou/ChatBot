	schema:reviewBody "I went into a screening of this today knowing only that it was about a woman who buys the home she lived in as an orphaned child planning to open it to other orphans that it mixed fantasy and reality and that Guillermo del Toro of 'Pan's Labyrinth' had a hand in it. I didn't have any expectations. Even if I did I certainly not have expected what I got. 'El Orfanato' surprised me first in successfully thrilling me with its surface and surprised me again in how deeply it moved me with its core.When Laura the marvelous Beln Rueda moves back into the house that used to be the orphanage she lived in as a girl she is thirtyseven married and she and her husband have adopted a son  Simn a little boy with HIV who doesn't know that he's terminally ill or adopted. Simn is wildly creative  he has several imaginary friends and a penchant for treasure hunts mind games and the story of Peter Pan. One day shortly after a mysterious visit from a social worker and Simn's revelation that he knows the truth about his adoption and illness Simn disappears. The rest of the film follows Laura's desperate search for her son as she comes to terms with her loss and her own past as well.Screenwriter Sergio G. Snchez does a masterful job of balancing the thriller with the drama. Laura's attempts to connect with everything that haunts her and her home are darkly touching though slightly psychologically twisted. The acting is strong and the directing editing cinematography and music all work together well. Some of the sound effects  the constant creaking wind blowing etc.  got wearisome as the film went on and some of the thrills were a little cheap  I won't ruin it for anyone by revealing them  though admittedly they were effective all the same. The story dragged a little towards the end and during the scene with the medium  cutting it just a little shorter might have been equally as effective and easier on the viewer.Bottom line even if you don't like scary movies like me you'll probably still appreciate and enjoy the more thrilling aspects. If you're a horror flick buff you'll probably find some of the thriller elements a little tired and overdone. Either way it's still worth seeing  the exploration of Laura's heart and mind are both lovely and tragic to behold and though the film is morbid it is beautiful as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bone chilling terrors with a hint of the fantastic await audiences who dare to enter The Orphanage. Produced by Guillermo Del Toro The Orphanage continues the tradition the filmmaker started with films like The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth by showing the darker sides of humanity through frightening fantasies. In many ways Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona has applied Del Toro's own winning formula to The Orphanage and has made the most flawless film of this lineage.Moving back to the orphanage where she grew up Laura and her husband Carlos plan to reopen the property as a home for mentally handicapped children. The gorgeous old house seems too good to be true and it is. Her son Simon starts telling his parents of an imaginary friend Tomas. Ignoring Simon's claims as merely childhood banter the parents continue in their work readying the house. Supernatural disturbances and a maniacal old woman start to disturb the family resulting in the sudden and traumatic disappearance of Simon. Desperate and panicked both Laura and Carlos must look within themselves and confront the beings that haunt the orphanage if they are ever to see their son again.A commentary on faith and love Bayona uses the thrills and troubling chills of The Orphanage to create a powerful message. Using the disappearance of Simon as the catalyst for showing the devotion of a mother's love Laura plays a stark contrast to her husband's practical interpretation of their harrowing situation. While Carlos would rather believe that there is a logical answer to unlocking this mystery Laura explores more otherworldly options.Her knowledge of the orphanage and the solitary pain that her missing child must be going through makes her a prime vessel to confront the ghastly creatures from beyond and answer the dark questions that De Toro and Bayona dare to ask. Like last year's Oscar front runner Pan's Labyrinth Bayona mixes a bit of the fantastical into The Orphanage. Allusions to legendary fables such as the overt Peter Pan reference combined with the staple fantasy images help The Orphanage rise above the average horror romp.With only the faintest bit of gore The Orphanage accomplishes its scares methodically using the somber atmosphere to give audiences goosebumps. The creaky old mansion appears far more menacing at night and Bayona makes use of incredible sound mixing to keep viewers on edge as the protagonist explores the dark unknown.Pairing the producer's innate knowledge of the cinematic language of horror with the raw and untested talents of a first time director paid off brilliantly. There is a sense of restraint when it comes to the scares in The Orphanage that many veteran filmmakers have failed to approach. Bayona lets the frights build subconsciously making each one far more effective when unleashed. In fact few cinematic moments rival The Orphanage for sheer terror as when Laura turns to a group of ghost hunters to help solve their specter problem.Helping to increase the tense atmosphere is stellar production design and gorgeous cinematography. While there may be no fauns or pale men lurking in The Orphanage the design of Tomas alone is sure to give off its fair share of shivers. Belen Rueda is equally stunning in her performance as Laura. The actress lends credibility to the phantasmagorical happenings capturing our sympathy as a fully rounded character. We follow her as a mother and a victim and we can only pray that her faith will reunite her with Simon.Heading to American shores nearly one year after the stunning domestic success of Pan's Labyrinth The Orphanage should appeal to an equally wide audience. While longtime art house Del Toro fiends will certainly be please with the dramatic arc of the picture the strong horror element and shocking ending should make the film easily translatable for all viewers despite the language barrier. One thing is for sure with The Orphanage we have adopted another truly talented Spanish filmmaker and Juan Antonio Bayona is a director to watch.Joe Russo".

A woman named Laura returns to the orphanage she grew up in as a child with the intention of opening it up again as a home for children with disabilities. Together with her husband and adopted son Simon Laura tries to make the huge old building ready to receive it's first new residents but all is not quiet in the dusty rooms and grounds and gradually she starts to feel sinister presences from the past making themselves known.The film strings out quite a good story blending traditional scares bumping noises heard through walls and doors silently appearing children in masks with modern touches Simon is HIV positive. Although most of the actual frights are on the soft side the film does have quite away with sudden shocks especially one great sequence involving the death of a sinister secondary character...you'll know when you see it! But mostly things stay pretty calm and there were times when I was wishing for something more visceral to actually happen as many of the very well built tension sequences fade away without any cinematic payoff such as a very tense sance sequence and in most of the many scenes of Laura alone in the orphanage she being almost too subtly menaced for things to get really scary which I think is a shame. However there are certain moments when you WILL jump!However The Orphanage still stands up as a strong piece of work. The backbone of the film is undoubtedly the strong performance by Beln Rueda as Laura who carries the entire film admirably. The film looks great with stunning photography and very elegant sets and a gorgeous building standing in for the orphanage itself. Sound and music work very well too and the film succeeds in working many small elements together such as a playground hiding game and some very clever revelations towards the end so all in all the film is an accomplished piece of cinema and well worth seeing although don't expect too much real terror as most of the chills in this film are poetic rather than gruesome.".

	schema:reviewBody "Laura Belen Rueda returns to the orphanage she spent time in as a child with her husband Carlos Fernando Cayo and little boy Simon Roger Princep in hopes of reestablishing it as seaside retreat for children with disabilities only to find there may be some former residents who never left. In Juan Antonio Bayona's tightly wound The Orphanage nothing is as it seems and child's play takes on sinister overtones.Bayona belongs to this new wave of Spanishlanguage directors most notably Del Torro and Amenabar who excel when it comes to creating moody atmospheric tales of the supernatural with Catholic overtones. Whereas Pan's Labyrinth took a dark fantasy approach to a Passion Play The Orphanage is closer to the classic haunted house themes of The Others as it attempts to give a sentimental view of life after death. Be warned The Orphanage is often more sad than scary and those not familiar with Catholic mysticism might find things a bit hard to believe. As goes the film's mantra...Believe Then You Will See. Those with the patience and the heart will be greatly rewarded as the audience doesn't necessarily have to Believe to relate to the characters who do.Working from refined less is more psychological horror templates Bayona delivers the formulaic goods. There will be a simplistic but heartfelt exploration of grief. There will be allusions to classic literature in this case a very nicely done Peter Pan as Catholic allegory motif. There will be uncovering dark secrets from the past. There will be precocious children with spooky imaginary friends. There will be creaking set designs and manipulative sound effects to create gotcha! moments. There will be a creepy medium an excellent Geraldine Chaplin brought in for a sance. And there will be a twist at the end.Thankfully there is also a great performance from Belen Rueda as Laura. She gives a compelling portrayal of a woman devoured by her loss and achingly desperate for the truth no matter how horrific that truth might be. One must have a cold heart not to find sympathy with her and even the most hardened audience member will find it hard not to feel that stray tear form in the corner of their trembling eye when all is revealed. The Orphanage offers nothing terribly new but sometimes the same old ghost story presented in a beautiful way makes for the best type of coldrainyday entertainment.".

Apart from the terrific scares there are solid performances from the whole cast stunning cinematography and the editing is flawless. If I had to criticise one element it is that the music swells just a little too much a couple of times but it is a good score nonetheless.See this one at the cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Laura returns with her family to the orphanage she grew up in as a child she reopens it for handicapped children and all is going to plan until her son starts communicating with an invisible friend.......Directed by Juan Antonio Bayona  produced by Guillermo del Toro this Spanish picture is a delightful antidote to the ream of gore for gore sake movies flooding the market on a seemingly daily basis. This is not a horror movie as such this is one of those pictures that oozes old fashioned values as regards telling a grand old ghost story with mysterious undertones. The setting is perfect the orphanage of the piece is a ghostly monolithic structure that has all those perfectly shadowy rooms that are hiding secrets expansive gardens perfectly framed in aura by Bayona's willingness to let the setting be an integral part of the story. The story is a creepy one and there is always an added air of unease when children are the focal point of the piece in question and sure enough this central concept of troubled children and troubled childhoods gets the maximum amount of emotion from the viewing public.It's hard to write anymore than I have without delving deeper into the story and it's significant turn of events suffice to say I feel this is a wonderful creepy and at times beautiful film that prospective viewers would be better off going into devoid of any prior knowledge. Beln Rueda plays Laura and it's a marvellous performance from her full of emotion and guts she carries the film with skillful ease. Bayona directs carefully and it's evident that he is benefiting from the guiding hands of his gifted producer but his marker is here and I'll be keeping an eye out for future efforts from the young Spaniard.A smashingly engaging film that is in the vein of Robert Wise's The Haunting  Alejandro Amenbar's The Others so if you like real well told ghost stories that unhinge rather than shock you get in the queue because El Orfanato is a real pleasure. 910".

	schema:headline " One two three knock on the wallEl Orfanato";
	schema:reviewBody "There is something to the marketing of foreign films and the way Hollywood tries its hardest to fool the public into thinking it is an English language movie. By not allowing any characters to speak in the trailers giving away their secret with subtitles someone like me knowing it's foreign is able to get a glimpse at the style and tone without really learning anything about the plot to ruin my surprise upon sitting in the theatre. This aspect worked perfectly for Guillermo Del Toro's production of El Orfanato. I had very little idea of what I was getting into and this film ended up being the best atmospheric horror I have seen since Alejandro Amenbar's The Others I don't count Del Toro's own El Laberinto del fauno because that was more fantasy than anything else. I now ask what it is that all three of these films have in common? With thisJ.A. Bayona's feature debuteach is helmed by a Spanish director. I can't think of a better nation making movies right now the Spanish are doing everything right and this film just adds to bolstering that argument.Bayona creates a mood and tone that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats anticipating the scares that they know will shortly be coming. I was actually surprised how slow the introduction was and how carefully laid out all the story pieces were. We are led into this world discovering the relationships between our lead roles and the vague past of the orphanage that once housed our heroine and now is about to become her home for special needs children. Like The Others the spirits involved here are not necessarily violent or demonic. They have an agenda for sure but what may at first glance seem malevolent could be nothing of the kind. The orphans now haunting the establishment are only trying to play a game. By taking something you love a scavenger hunt is begun. Following the clues is the only way the game can end and if successful the children will grant you one wish. The rules are simple except the circumstances are far from easily accessible. One must believe that the game can happen before heshe can truly take part. Without the belief that the spirits are in control success can never be achieved.The cast is led by a remarkable performance from Beln Ruedawho as it turns out had a wonderful turn in Amenbar's latest Mar adentro. Her composure and beauty is shattered as she finds her son has been lost. Trying to keep herself together taking in what the police her husband and the mediums enlisted to help on the paranormal aspect tell her she is given the task to figure out for herself how far she is willing to go to find her son. Always captivating and never out of her element Rueda carries the story and never looks back. The supporting players around her are all portrayed nicely as well. Fernando Cayo plays the husband watching his wife deteriorate before him while unable to open his mind to the possibility that what she says could be true Geraldine Chaplin is magnificent as the psychic medium whose trance brings out a puzzle piece necessary to continue the game and young Roger Prncep plays the child Simn with the right amount of innocence mixed with the knowledge and comprehension of his fate to help keep the bond between he and his mother strong.Bayona never goes for the cheap thrills either as he builds up the tension with sounds and visuals. His use of the closing doors and the moving merrygoround add a sense of foreboding that ends up being more important than you may initially guess. Stylistically too the transition between the house's current state of duress with the way it shone by the glow of the adjacent lighthouse from the past is expertly handled. There were numerous instances where the film could have gone off the rails to tragic effect but he holds it steady throughout. More psychological than visceral the scares are few but effective. Even when the grotesque rears its head it is to enhance the story not to shock for shock alone. The sound work is utilized to the fullest too. What seems to be jarring and loud for the purpose to scare our lead and us is actually very important to the tale at hand. Nothing is shown or heard here that doesn't have absolute relevance to the film as a whole.The final third of the film comes quick and fully envelopes you into the proceedings. You are right there with Rueda's character as she slowly uncovers the secrets hidden behind the years that have past since she last lived in the orphanage. Whereas a film from Hollywoodof late usually being a remake from a better horror film in Japanwould use this tension in order to hide the flimsy and lackluster conclusion it tacks on so as not to alienate those viewers who enjoy leaving the theatre with a smile Bayona knows how to effectively end his tale the way it should. I was blown away by the handling of the final scene and the way he used the rules of the game to transition us from one reality to another. It is truly a remarkable feat that hits home hard emotionally but I will actually say also succeeded in me leaving with a smile on my face. Whether you exit the theatre with your eyes moistened or not you will not forget the beauty and perfection for which it concludes. The tagline is correct for while it is a story of horror it is above all else a tale of love.".

One of those three Alfonso Curon said in an interview last year that the trio himself Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu  Guillermo del Toro considered themselves to be nothing in comparison to what is to come.With The Orphanage executive produced by del Toro we get to see some work from the first of the new Hispanic wave namely the Spaniard Juan Antonio Bayona. Although del Toro's name is plastered all over the posters this is undeniably Bayona's film who with stylish photography effective design and confident direction makes this a fantastically gripping and moving piece of work.It is a staggeringly bold and extremely exciting feature debut by this director. From the very first shot the audience can see that this director has style and an eye for striking images. But he also knows how to manipulate an audience. The early scenes grip the audience as Bayona builds up a tense atmosphere filled with the sort of menace that Hitchcock created in so many films.Then when the supernatural plot gets going he fills the film with enough memorable visual touches and crash bang wallop moments to keep you on the edge of your seat. A number of scenes excel especially one where a medium is used in the eponymous orphanage and wanders the apparently empty corridors viewed in the eerie green of night vision. It is a magnificent thrilling scene and although it sounds clichd it is fresh inventive and spinechilling.But this film is so much more than a nuts and bolts ghost story. The film ends with a wonderful moving twist that is at once heartbreaking and utterly uplifting. This is an engrossing and thrilling film and a triumph of superior direction but it is the film's intelligent and philosophical side that stays with you long after your spine has stopped tingling.".

	schema:headline " Pretty decent though not particularly scary supernatural mysterydrama";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is less like a traditional horror movie and more of a dramamystery with strong supernatural elements. The setup is that Laura who once lived at an orphanage returns to the orphanage with her husband and son to start it up again as a place for special needs children. Of course it all seems simple but there are mysteries abound in this story and the revelations trickle in over the course of the tale.The film isn't particularly frightening although it has a couple of jumpy moments. Rather than focusing on creating an atmosphere of fear instead it works on drawing up sympathy for Laura's plight as events transpire against her and her family and the past comes back to haunt her. It's an interesting meditation on loss as well that had a wonderful potential to straddle the line between realworld and supernatural but don't worry folks it doesn'tit's firmly supernatural and you know it from early on. Nonetheless that you could imagine this film working even if the supernatural elements were just in Laura's mind and that's a pretty good thing for the drama.The technical aspects of the film are all sound although I noticed a couple of background gaffs but I think you'd have to look for them with clear direction capable lensing and design. The actors all do a good job of rendering their characters children fare believably enough and Belen Rueda carries the film well as the central protagonist. The story itself doesn't reach any great depths but unraveling the mystery with the film is enjoyable.It's nothing stunning but in the world of horror films it easily stands a shoulder above the regular flotsam that the genre tends to churn out. At that it's no terrible film and could be recommended if you're looking for a relatively intelligent and well composed supernatural horrortype film. Just don't expect bloodbaths and constant shocks. 710.".

	schema:headline " Admirable atmosphere  setting.";
	schema:reviewBody "I pretty much knew with relative certainty and from beforehand that The Orphanage wasn't going to be my cup of tea. Slowbrooding ghost stories almost never appeal to me and I didn't even care for producer Guillermo Del Toro's own and critically acclaimed The Devil's Backbone. But considering the hugely positive internet buzz as well as the endless amount of praising reviews on this website I  being a devoted horror fanatic  simply couldn't afford to ignore this Spanish instant classic entirely. Well the only thing I can conclude after seeing the film is that The Orphanage is exactly what you expect from a relatively soft mainstream and overall ethically correct modern day horror production whether it's made in Spain Japan or elsewhere in the world. Obviously it's an extremely professionally made film with a handful of memorable style elements and effective jump moments but in the end it really isn't much more than just another derivative and predictable 'ghosts from the past coming back to haunt us' tale that lack the courage to go very far. Undoubtedly the qualitatively greatest aspect about The Orphanage is the naturally sinister setting. The events take place in an old and remote orphanage  duh  located near a quiet beach with an inactive lighthouse and a wide network of sinister caves. Laura who spend her childhood here returns with her husband and 7yearold son and intends to reopen the orphanage specifically for orphans with a mental andor physical handicap. On the day of the opening however Laura's own son Simon  who's also adopted and chronically ill  mysteriously disappears without a trace. Months go by without a sign of life and Laura understandably starts to get desperate. Was Simon kidnapped by the uncanny lady who arrived at the orphanage and posed as a social assistant shortly before his disappearance? Or perhaps Laura should have listened more to her son's stories about the invisible friends he made as they seem to know an awful lot of accurate details about the orphanage's dark past. Somewhat to my anticipated frustration The Orphanage contains all the clichs and stereotypes the sub genre of ghost stories has to offer. There's the overly fanatic mother versus the rational father the eccentric and somewhat flamboyant spiritual medium the morbid old lady that may or may not be real and of course a wide collection of pityevoking long dead children whose souls are restless. The young and relatively inexperienced director J.A. Bayona does an impressive job maintaining the macabre ambiance all the way from start to finish but sadly it isn't enough to qualify as a masterpiece in the genre. There's only just ONE that really made me jump towards the edge for my seat for a little while namely the second confrontation with the elderly lady in the middle of a busy street. Although this is unquestionably a truly masterful sequence it's nearly not enough as far as I'm concerned. Many fans glorify the finale but the whole third act actually just confirmed to me that The Orphanage rather wanted to be a sentimental melodrama about the true values of family and motherly love. When it comes to Spanish ghost stories of the past 10 to 20 years Amenbar's unique and already classic The Others is still the norm and The Orphanage is not likely to change that.".

Sure I will  just as soon as pigs fly out my rear end whistling the Colonel Bogey March. But I went to see El Orfanato because I gathered that it was more of a ghost story than a horror film and that it was more of a thoughtful reflection on The Unseen World like Don't Look Now or The Sixth Sense than a movie whose main purpose was to scare the bejabbers out of the audience.And so it turned out to be. Which isn't to say that it didn't scare the bejabbers out of the audience! Several times.The film comes from Spain and stars Spanish TV star Belen Rueda as Laura. We learn that Laura was an inmate of an orphanage that she was adopted away from the orphanage and that she has at the present time returned to the old property with her husband and adopted child to create a home for neglected children.This movie like Sixth Sense one of my alltime favorite films is about love and death. In fact I think they both share the same message that is that helping those most in need of help gives life meaning. I enjoyed The Orphanage and I think you will too. If you just plain don't like being frightened in movies then stay away. But there's no glorified violence and  you know how the music builds and builds more and more ominous and the thing which is about to attack gets closer and closer? There is some of that but mostly it's used as exposition  it's when you're not really expecting anything that the director pushes the bejabbers button leaving the audience chuckling  like whoo  THAT was a GOOD one!I think folks who like a good haunted house story will like this and people who like a good love story will like it as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Recent horror films seem more inclined to thrill than to chill. Such hits like Dawn of Dead and I am Legend are great movies but their fear comes from intensity rather than dread. However there have been a few good chillers out there such as The Others and The Ring. And now The Orphanage from acclaimed Spanish producer Guillermo del Toro creeps its way into their ranks while still being a genredefying film.The story revolves around Laura a woman who buys her childhood home in hopes of starting an orphanage for handicapped children with her husband Carlos. But soon their son Simn starts communicating with the orphans who used to live there. Thus many spookydoins' begin. And boy are they spooky. The Orphanage is certainly not the first film to use the creepy kids angle but screenwriter Sergio Snchez made the story original and engrossing enough to be wholly enjoyable.One of the creepiest factors of The Orphanage is its sound design. The house contains plentiful creaks and groans which seem to come standard in all haunted houses but the real frights come from the music. As well as being ambrosial to the ears it has the power to induce an assortment of emotions. It can bring a tear to your eye or make you cramp up in your seat from suspense.But the real enjoyment comes from the acting. Horror films are known for having some of the campiest acting out of all the film genres but The Orphanage is one of those rare gems where the actors are so great they make you think Yeah maybe they really are experiencing supernatural phenomena. And Kudos to Beln Rueda Laura for having the most range and believability in the entire movie. Her performance transcends the language barrier and makes you forget you're reading subtitles.To round out the film is the cinematography and if Guillermo del Toro is involved you know it will be stylish to the max. The manorlike orphanage is not the typical rundown creepy haunted house. It isn't so much haunting as it is hauntingly beautiful. And each of the places around it follow suit such as the beach and the playground. Each scene is so elegant that it can be incredibly terrifying while still being gorgeously shot at the same time.Of course The Orphanage isn't perfect. One of its weakest points is that it is a bit clich. There are a bunch or creepy kids there is a medium that contacts the dead and gosh does that house ever shutup? But with all that aside The Orphanage is still a classy and mysterious haunted house movie that will keep you guessing and screaming until the end. Do yourself a favor and go see this film despite the subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "The uninspired movie for people who think they are cool and hip by liking foreign movies. This movie is a bad tasting stew made with ingredients from far superior movies and every once in a while while watching this boring turd I kept thinking I wish I were seeing one of those instead.First to all ignorants out there this film was not directed by Guillermo del Toro who has not that many credits under his belt to pull a Spielberg. The act of good will of acting as Executive Prducer by using you name to push the movie of a lesser known director with talent is a feat reserved to few film makers and del Toro is not yet one of them.This movie was directed by first time Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona and his firts film is flawed to the brim. I don't see why or no let me rephrase I do see why he needed del Toro's name to sell this movie cause without the name I don't think any distributor would have bought it.The main flaw with this movie is the flaw of most if not all scary movies of today it's a classic case of been there done that and a million times better. Every single concept handled in the movie has been handled before in far superior movies like Poltergeist which was written by Spielberg or The Sixth Sense by M. Nigh Shyamalan and The Others by Alejandro Amenabar. Hell the movie even rips off Friday the 13th and even goes to the point of ripping off Peter Pan this movie has Poltergeists a Jason children ghosts that only one person can see you name the scary movie The Orphanage found some weird cheap way to package it then adds very similar elements of Pan's Labyrinth at the end and hopes everyone will be too much of an idiot to be sucked into the cheap thrill moments. The movie relies on the shock high modulated surprise music cue way too much a thing that pisses me off tremendously cause once you've used it no matter how much depth of field shots you can include the energy is out and the movie is running on fumes. Not even Jaws a classic of the thrilling genre uses the high pitch music cue in it's big thrill moment where Roy Scheider is gonna need a bigger boat.The sort of 112 method of this movie gets so boring that within 15 or 20 minutes of film you pretty much figure out the entire thing and you have to sit through until it unfolds slowly in a very boring fashion. I hate when thrillers become predictable cause they stop being thrilling and that is the case of The Orphanage cause it is predictable by doing everything that has been done in movies about haunted houses and children only with less flare less style and certainly less greatness.The movie is terribly written terribly directed and also does some pretty stupid casting choices. I mean I love Edgar Vivar I think that as every person of Latin America born from 1965 onwards we count El Chavo as one of our most important childhood programs and Vivar as Senor Barriga was funny as hell but when he is supposed to be a guru of the occult that just doesn't work when he started talking about the ghosts everyone laughs cause it just doesn't work at all and getting Geraldine Chaplin to pull the trick of using a funny person as the sance just like Zelda Rubinstein's Tangina in Poltergeist was flat down boring you kept thinking why is Mrs. Chaplin trying to copy Zelda Rubinstein? The end of the movie also leaves something to be desired the movie no matter how much it tried to trick the audience into thinking it was a serious movie they just could not stick with the sad ending they had to give a positive cheerful note at the end just in case people get too disturbed let's kill the little dark overtone of having a boy with AIDS I can see the producers and Bayona let's give it a Pan's Labyrinth touch that worked last year right? The movie also makes the stupid clich of having the protagonist discover the most retched scary places imaginable and well obviously she is going to go in alone with out a flashlight cause if she doesn't the movie can't be scary and just when it gets too scary someone walks in and saves the day just at the nick of time well sure cause if no one saved the protagonist from a heart attack the movie would be over an that is too much to hope for.Not to mention some incoherent elements like a woman mistaking red haired little girls for her brunette boy and a mysterious and tool like character that makes no sense has no beginning and no end and only works for comedy and terror and to tie in a plot hole.Aside from creating a convincing looking set the movie really has nothing worth mentioning or remembering cause I already could mention and already remembered all the things that happened on this movie from other better movies.This is the epitome of uninspired cinema and it's a shame that just cause del Toro put his name in it distributors and audiences were suckered in on it.".

The movie also makes the stupid clich of having the protagonist discover the most retched scary places imaginable and well obviously she is going to go in alone with out a flashlight cause if she doesn't the movie can't be scary and just when it gets too scary someone walks in and saves the day just at the nick of time well sure cause if no one saved the protagonist from a heart attack the movie would be over an that is too much to hope for.Not to mention some incoherent elements like a woman mistaking red haired little girls for her brunette boy and a mysterious and tool like character that makes no sense has no beginning and no end and only works for comedy and terror and to tie in a plot hole.Aside from creating a convincing looking set the movie really has nothing worth mentioning or remembering cause I already could mention and already remembered all the things that happened on this movie from other better movies.This is the epitome of uninspired cinema and it's a shame that just cause del Toro put his name in it distributors and audiences were suckered in on it.";

Spanish cinema is going to become one of the best creator of this kind of genre. This film has a different style of mystery not the same we see in most of the horrorsuspense movies in which the overact curiosity of the characters carry to cross the creepy door where are killed in the next shot with the axe or the saw no... this time the bad guy isn't the ghost.

	schema:reviewBody "I happened to be in Denver on business and the Denver film festival was in full swing. When I found out this film was playing at midnight on my last night in Denver I jumped at the chance to walk 20 blocks one way and in November to see it. I was not disappointed.I was not impressed in the beginning because the film seemed a bit derivative to me. I mean just how many ghost stories concerning children are there? And with imaginary friends too? I was thinking Amityville Horror The Shining Wicked Little Things et al ad nauseum. But boy was I wrong! There are entire sequences that are reminiscent of classic fright films of course the boy with imaginary friends as mentioned above but also a psychic and her entourage right out of Poltergeist there's a death I've seen before as well I think out of one of the Final Destination films and of course the general outlinea ghost story set in an orphanageis vaguely reminiscent of Guillermo del Toro's own The Devil's Backbone. All the ghostly trappings we have come to expect from classic fright films are there as well from mysterious noises and bangings to ghostly visions. I'm not saying that this film ripped off any other film on the contrary it was great fun recognizing all these classic fright moments and they weren't done in an homage type of waythey stood on their own.I can't tell you the last time a film made me jump. It has been a long while since I've attended a film that made the entire audience jump. This one does it not once not twice not thrice but several times. It is spooky and atmospheric in places it has some jump scares but it also has some outandout scares that are guaranteed to get to you no matter how hardcore you think you may be.I do have to say that I guessed early on what happened in the end. I didn't know exactly why or how but I did guess the cause of the haunting. I don't think it mattered I don't think it was being hidden. I think it was obvious that the orphanage was haunted because of some terrible past event involving children why else would you call it The Orpanage?!. But the reason behind the event was solid and the way the protagonist finds the information is cool. Besides wasn't it Alfred Hitchcock who said that it isn't the bomb under the table that makes the scene scary it's the fact that you don't know when it's going to blow up that creates the tension. So it didn't matter that I understood early on WHAT had caused the haunting.And finally the ending is bittersweet. It isn't a typical American ending in that everything is wrapped up and presented to the audience with a bow. It isn't a sanitized ending and it isn't necessarily a perfectly happy ending. I like that. It seems more real to me. I hate the fact that we Americans tend to want a sugary sweet ending so we can walk out and smile about the film without any more thought given. In fact the last American film I can think of that didn't deliver the sappy ending was Sandra Bullock's Premonition and it flopped at the theater.Another film that I would draw comparisons to is Kevin Costner's Dragonfly. It is similar in theme in that it is pretty creepy and scary until the end when you have some resolution for the protagonist but not a typically happy American endinga bittersweet ending much like The Orphanage.Overall I truly enjoyed this film. It was spooky it made me jump it was fun and it had a good ending. I hope the director makes more like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a child Laura was in an orphanage until she was adopted young. Years later she has returned to the building with her husband and adopted child Simn with the aim of making it both their home and also a place for the care of special children.. Simn has his own challenges one of which is his reliance on imaginary friends but when he claims to have met one in particular Toms things take a very dark turn for the worse.After a few weeks of listening to mark Kermode praising this film I got myself along to a cinema to see it. What I found was not the amazing earthshattering film that some had claimed  but this is a common thing for good foreign films they tend to be extra praised because they are foreign. Don't let my sentences put you off though because this is a very effective and enjoyable ghost story. Director Bayona uses the devices that you'll have seen other films of the same ilk using but the thing is he does it really well. The creeping camera is used several times without a related payoff producing a constant air of tension that is almost a relief in a perverse way when a proper scare does come. As many others have said it is very unnerving rather than gory with slow movement replacing jump scares and so on all to good effect.The story is no slouch either and it is built on the desperation of Laura and the loss of her treasure. This puts a very human heart to the ghost story engaging the viewer and making it easier for scepticism to be put to one side even if only for a few hours. The narrative carries a satisfying arch that is ultimately as tragic as it is happy and as relatable as it fantastic. To put it another way when a specific scare was not happeningabout to happen I was still interested in what was happening and boredom never occurred. The cast deliver well too. Rueda is the heart of the film and she is convincing throughout. Cayo's Carlos is a lot less important but he plays his character well. Prncep's Simn is the right kid for the job as his matteroffact lack of fear adds to the story. The rest of the child cast are weaker but mostly their creepy silent presence is all that is required.The Orphanage is not anything new or brilliant then but it is very efficient and effective. The story is a strong base for a consistently creepy air that is expertly delivered by Bayona who makes it all look easy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Achingly sad is a term I have never used before to describe a horror movie but it captures 'El Orfanato' perfectly. This tale revolves around a young family who move into an orphanage where the mother resided as a child. They intend to reopen it as a home for disabled children but as we get to know them the realisation dawns that they are not alone in the house.What starts with the premise of being a classic haunted house tale including the new vogue for stories of this kind  i.e. creepy children is actually transformed into something which takes it from a standard horror to something much more powerful. With powerful emotional performances especially from the lead actress x as mother Laura who was sensational in her portrayal of grief this ghost story transcended its genre and turned into a touching desperate account of a mother driven mad by the disappearance of her son. The audience couldn't fail to be moved almost to tears as we follow what essentially becomes Laura's story and the Spanish language made it somehow more realistic for me. I do hope this film doesn't get an Englishlanguage remake. It is so unique for a horror film to move me close to tears alongside providing a wonderfully built up tense and creepy atmosphere and this is where El Orfanato comes into its own. There is a slowburning build up to the emotionallywrought finale and the direction acting and score which is quite impressive on its own especially the end credit music each add something to this brilliantly atmospheric piece. Indeed the creation and sustaining of the atmosphere is probably the films highest point because it build in you a classic horror tension whilst letting you into the personal grief and sadness of Laura at the same time.There are some shock moments and jumps hidden amongst the twists and turns of the plot but this is not a film to see if you are looking to be scared witless by your horror. More this is an entirely different film which is seeking to add depth and something more to the horror genre than cheap thrills and moments that make might make you jump but ultimately add nothing to the story. Each part of the film was well made acted and directed and all go to making this film one of the most unique horrors I have come across. 810".

The terror is masterfully used here not only because it really frightens when it's meant to but also because the terror is genuine avoiding the use of cheap terror and sophisticated digital tricks.There have been comparisons with The Changeling 1980 and Poltergeist 1982. This and The Changeling have slight similarities in details but nothing major. As for Poltergeist frankly I don't see much where to compare them. Yes they are both about ghosts but I can't say they are similar just because they have ghosts.El Orfanato is a great movie on its own. It is clearly one of the best movies of the year 2007 and one of the best from the 20002009 decade. Considering that this generation brought some but very few really good movies I highly doubt the current decade will bring many worthy films although we can always give the benefit of doubt.I got to know that Hollywood plans to remake this valuable Spanish piece of cinema. Can't say that I'm surprised. Hollywood stubbornly insists on remaking films. Stealing the others's works must give them pleasure so that they can claim it as their own when we who know the truth know what the truth is.This should definitely be on Top 250.".

Considering that this generation brought some but very few really good movies I highly doubt the current decade will bring many worthy films although we can always give the benefit of doubt.I got to know that Hollywood plans to remake this valuable Spanish piece of cinema. Can't say that I'm surprised. Hollywood stubbornly insists on remaking films. Stealing the others's works must give them pleasure so that they can claim it as their own when we who know the truth know what the truth is.This should definitely be on Top 250.";

For awhile after Malcolm first begins his activism with the nation of Islam you find yourself conflicted both respecting the man and often disagreeing with him. Lee handles it well without condemning or supporting really just showing Malcolm's gradual transition in his beliefs. The inserted documentary footage especially at the end shows how Malcolm's words still relate today. Someone commented that they only watched an hour of the movie and Lee doesn't know how to tell a story but maybe if they would be slightly more openminded realize it's not a literal adaptation of the autobiography and actually finish the film they could understand that Lee does not just want to tell the story of one man but rather wants it to reflect the struggle of a race.

	schema:headline " Epic film does justice to its subject.";
	schema:reviewBody "Spike Lee struggled mightily to get 'Malcolm X' made financially and artistically. But when all was said and done he produced an epic blockbuster and a definite treatment of the man's life.There's great differences between the two as well but to me Lee has many things in common with Oliver Stone. Both of them seem to have been born to make films. Both of them are uncompromising in bringing their artistic and moral vision to the screen and neither will try to seduce the public by catering to their tastes. Both present their own interpretation of facts without apology. For example from what I've read it's not certain that Malcolm's father was actually killed by Klansmen. But Lee isn't in the same league as Stone when it comes to playing fast and loose with the truth. Stone even ends his movie 'Nixon' in a similar way to 'Malcolm X' with footage of reallife figures blended in though I'm not accusing Stone of imitation.This movie has an epic sweep and scope and as a director Lee is up to the challenge. He is served well by being able to direct in several styles one of which is almost cartoonish witness the scene where Malcolm Denzel Washington and Shorty played by Lee himself go stepping out at the Roseland Ballroom resplendent in their zoot suits. Some comic relief is welcome at times because otherwise the serious heavy message of the picture might be overwhelming. For instance the movie opens with a fullscreen shot of an American flag while we hear a voiceover of one of Malcolm's most rousing or inflammatory speeches depending on how you look at it I accuse the white man of being the greatest murderer on the planet! The flag begins to burn and eventually forms a flaming 'X' as the fiery rhetoric continues. But if you haven't been scared away the next scene shows the young man Malcolm Little in a funny situation having his hair straightened by a concoction that threatens to burn off his scalp.Denzel Washington has won beaucoups of rightlydeserved accolades for his amazing performance in the title role. If you've ever heard or seen Malcolm X's speaking you will be astounded at the similarities in tone and cadence. The illusion is so real one may not recognize that real archival footage of Malcolm is used late in the film. But this is not a case of style over substance here. Between Washington's talent and Lee's directing and screenwriting an unforgettable character emerges. The film boasts other fine performances by Al Freeman Jr. especially good as Elijah Muhammad a controversial figure in society and eventually to Malcolm himself Delroy Lindo Albert Hall Kate Vernon Ernest Thomas and many others in its large cast.It's clear that Lee doesn't care for the Motion Picture Academy and they don't particularly care for him. But the snubbing he and his picture got at Oscar time would be comparable to Richard Attenborough and 'Ghandi' not being nominated the year that film was made. Ordinarily one would think this film is the kind of production Hollywood loves to honor. But Academy Award nominations or not the film 'Malcolm X' is like the man himself impossible to ignore.".

So many want to glorify King as the only leader of the time but X was a leader in his own right. His ideas weren't that different from King's. His approach was honest and a response to the times. Denzel shows every emotion in his face that seemed to formulate in his mind. I seriously thought of him as Malcolm.

His one weak area in this film was editing. There is no reason this movie couldn't have been half an hour shorter. Right off the bat there were unnecessarily lingering camera shots and scenes that could have omitted. Off the top of my head I'm thinking of Spike himself sliding under a woman's skirt and mugging the camera. That scene not only failed to further the story but instead made the audience stand up and say Hey that's Spike looking at us! Lee's biggest editing mistake was based on his desire to tell the story of Malcolm X AND tell the story of the AfricanAmerican experience. That's more than enough for several movies so why cram it all under one title? After a clear scene illustrating X's life Lee would move to a large dance hall to illustrate the richness of the AfricanAmerican experience. A quick shot of the dance hall would have been sufficient. Instead the far away shots were maintained for too long and when the focus moved back to specific characters it moved to the character played by Lee himself. Why? I don't know. It certainly didn't help us to understand X any better. The ending with children saying I am Malcolm X also went on too long and should have been part of a separate feature. The cameos were distracting. The movie could have been tighter shorter and better except that Spike Lee wanted to put everything including the kitchen sink into it.That being said it is a great movie and I'm glad I invested the three and a half hours to watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think the major success of Alex Haley with this movie is that he tells the story of a dynamic person known as 'Malcolm X' with such a skill that no man from any part of any society get his feelings hurt. I think it is a commendable effort from Alex Haley Spike Lee and Danzel Washington that they made a hero out of Malcolm X. I think he deserved it because he was the man who was not after money or popularity......he changed his statements his way of life  even his faith as he knew that those were true. The theme of the movie is very clear that Malcolm X was not a hardliner rather he was always open for truth. Secondly it also emphasized though in the end that negotiations and reforms is a better way than the violence. But yet it also gave the message that the ruling races reap the violence which they breed themselves sometimes in the hegemony of their power or sometimes due the wrong interpretation of their religious verdicts. I think it was right to hit at the ' Black organization known as nation of Islam' and Elijah Muhammad. Muslim community is itself greatly indebted to this movie because Elijah Muhammad's teaching were very far from Islam. The real Islam practiced worldwide does not believe in the continuance of prophethood after Muhammad P.B.U.Hand the Black supremacy by Elijah Muhammad was a ridiculous idea as Islam does not believe in Nationalism. Any Muslim anywhere in the world whether black or white are equal in Islam's teachings. It was great to see the scenes of pilgrimage to Makkah ....... these were not unnecessary ......because they helped us to understand the sudden change in the teachings of Malcolm X. Denzel's acting is really superb and also that of Al Freeman Jr. I think this movie is an invaluable resource for the people who want to take an insight into the Malcolm X's life.".

Reading his autobiography will actually help you understand him even further. As will his indication that AfricanAmericans bled for the white man in Korea Japan Italy etc. so why shouldn't they bleed for their freedom at home?

	schema:headline " Malcolm Big";
	schema:reviewBody "There's two ways to look at this movie as an entertaining evening filler a rollercoaster of a movie it's very successful  strange and no mean feat for a biopic about a radical black leader from yesteryear. As a biography however which is supposed to tell you the truth about a person I think it's simply a piece of blatant propaganda. I see it as a lost chance to do the man Malcolm X Little justice and also to show up the critical aspects of his persona.The acting is great I particularly enjoyed Angela Bassett as Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz as well as director Spike Lee playing Malcolm's zoot era friend the wily Shorty. Overall this movie is well made as can be expected of a great director such as Spike Lee.OK let's focus on content then. Malcolm X wasn't Martin Luther King but this movie portrays him like he had been King's ghetto version. In his autobiography Malcolm X describes himself as having started as a street thug although one who was driven to this life by racism who was transformed in prison to a black minister and leader. An alternative but possibly more enlightened way to describe his career would be that he took up the same profession as his father that of a black separatist minister his father had followed Marcus Garvey Malcolm followed Elijah Muhammad instead.Another fact that the movie didn't bring out is that the Nation Of Islam are no Muslims. They were an idiosyncratic black American sect which borrowed some formal aspects from Islam and sold Elijah Muhammad instead of adhering to his prophet namesake. One interesting question to ask yourself about Malcolm X is when did he figure out that the NOI were about as halal as ham hock? If he really only became wise to the game after Muhammad had kicked him out that would have made him seem a bit dim in the intellectual department and I don't think that he was anything but sharp. But if he found out before then why didn't he leave the sect by himself? Does anyone really buy his magic transformation into a proper Muslim and nonracist on the hadj he went on after he had been forced to leave NOI? In the movie Malcolm starts to doubt Elijah Muhammad pretty abruptly when he finds out that he has fathered children with his  very much younger  secretaries. This is shown melodramatically where the mothers are dressed up in their full freaky NOI costume have their darling children playing around their feet and profess that they are only worried about their toddlers' wellbeing i. e. present the picture of purity. I didn't buy that either neither in the film nor in Malcolm X's life.There are simply some aspects this movie should have addressed some questions it should have raised. Instead it cultivates and adulates Malcom X. Apart from being a fierce speaker and writer what actual plans did Malcolm X have? Did he implement them did they work out did they fail? How serious was he about separating the races or was that just rhetorics? Did he actually further or hinder the Civil Rights movement? Didn't he especially in the light of Obama fail quite badly by his own standards? One scene I didn't buy at all was when Malcolm liberates a black man from racist police imprisonment. He threatens the officer in charge by telling him to look out of the window through which we see a thin row of NOI goons standing before the police precinct. Somehow the captain freaks at the sight of 20 dudes in suits and ties and immediately gives in. In the following scene Malcolm gives them a sign and they turn around like robots and march off. Wow that's how the NOI fought? Too bad Martin Luther King hadn't thought of that. Although I'd advise anyone not to don suit and tie and descend on the local police outpost yet. Spike Lee feeds us off with simple cinematic razzledazzle.Spike Lee also tells us quite unambiguously that Malcolm's father was murdered by the KKK where this is at best highly speculative.Another point were the NOI with their guru their uniforms their sex separation and their bodyguards not perhaps a pretty scary outfit? Scary not only in the KKK had finally met their matchsense but more as in made the KKK seem like a regular bunch of guys with a hood fixation and the John Birch Society like a bunch of hippies? Just a thought.Then in the final scene Spike Lee serves up a I'm Malcom X scene which wouldn't have looked out of place in a Stalinist propaganda film.Malcolm X once said that all his achievements should be blamed on Allah and only his failings on himself. Spike Lee should have taken his word. If you want to learn more about Malcolm X then even his autobiography is a better choice.".

This biopic and Spike's fifth fulllength feature makes only partial sense as a followup to his greatest classics Do The Right Thing Mo' Better Blues and Jungle Fever the three films in which he created and developed his unique voice and made a name for himself as one of the most prominent independent filmmakers in the US Spike's own voice can barely be heard in Malcolm X and his usually immediately recognizable trademarks are tough to point out. The reason is that for the first time in his career Spike Lee took a step back and he is not the dominant personality in the film the dominant personality is Malcolm X himself and Spike let Malcolm's voice be heard throughout the film louder than anything else.So Malcolm X is less a work of art and more a statement than Spike's previous films. It's scope is immensely larger than anything he did before  it does after all span 200 minutes  and is therefore naturally not as tight and focused as Do The Right Thing or Jungle Fever but in Malcolm X Spike tackles head on the very subjects he treated with symbolism and subtlety in those films and it was therefore a natural and important progression for him and a logical continuation of those movies and in it he proved that he has more than one voice. In a biopic and for that matter in any docudrama the most important factor is for the director to care about the subject and I'm yet to see a director who's more passionate about his subject than Mr. Lee.Malcolm X boasts a huge ensemble casts with wonderful performances by Delroy Lindo Angela Bassette Al Freeman Jr. in a harrowing performance as Muslim extremist Elijah Muhammad and Spike Lee himself  but the movie is still entirely Malcolm X's and therefore Denzel Washington's. Spike's protg gave a lifetime performance in Mo' Better Blues two years earlier but he surpassed it with his gutwrenching portrayal of Malcolm X which earned him an Oscar nomination unfortunately lost to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman and based him as one of the best actors of his generation.Although Malcolm X is not Spike Lee's best film it's an important film that needed to be made and it's a good thing that Spike was the one to do it.

The thesis is of the book is that the severe bigotry and injustice experienced by Negroes in America has been replaced by an equally inaccurate and unjust expectation of perfection. There is an attempt to correct the errors of slavery prejudice and brutal discrimination by recreating reality in an equally tragically inaccurate set of expectations. Blacks have been miraculously transformed from ignorant vile subhumans to noble perfect superior beings that have been unjustly suppressed for reasons of racist ambitions greed envy etc. Neither of these depictions is accurate and both misconceptions degrade the social and economic ascendance that is the answer to the issues of black society.This film and its writers producers directors critics etc. are an example of the extremes to which myth has attempted to transplant error. The protagonist is depicted as a humble gifted noble and superior hero who conquered white oppression through selfenlightenment. In reality Malcolm Little was a felon a convict and a miscreant who sought advancement through narcotics prostitution and illegal gambling. His enlightenment through the spiritual experience of the Nation of Islam Black Muslims was depicted in his statement about President Kennedy's assassination the chickens would come home to roost. Malcolm's association with the Black Muslims ended in his own brutal assassination by other peaceful enlightened members of the Nation of Islam.But Spike Lee directed this movie as a tribute to a hero who transcended racism though enlightenment and moral superiority. This is a terrible film not only because of its betrayal of reality but because it perpetuates the myths that are as evil as the bigotry and persecution that it assaults. There are no mythical heroes just as there are no subhumans among the black races. Miraculous transformation of history does no more to elevate society than prejudice does. Greater lies cannot correct other lies.Richard Pryor made the best statement on reality I have ever heard. Its majesty lies in its simplicity and accuracy. On a trip to Africa he attended a large community celebration of ethnic music dancing revelry etc. As he sat among the hundreds of revelers he thought to himself Now look around you. Do you see any Niggahs here? He answered to himself No there aren't any. There never were any. Just people. That's all there ever were. In the same way if the filmmakers as well as the multitudes of activists who advocate societal betterment would just see that all they have to deal with are people the issues could begin to be resolved. Fantasies like this movie only prolong the hatred and incomprehension.".

There are no mythical heroes just as there are no subhumans among the black races. Miraculous transformation of history does no more to elevate society than prejudice does. Greater lies cannot correct other lies.Richard Pryor made the best statement on reality I have ever heard. Its majesty lies in its simplicity and accuracy. On a trip to Africa he attended a large community celebration of ethnic music dancing revelry etc. As he sat among the hundreds of revelers he thought to himself Now look around you. Do you see any Niggahs here? He answered to himself No there aren't any. There never were any. Just people. That's all there ever were. In the same way if the filmmakers as well as the multitudes of activists who advocate societal betterment would just see that all they have to deal with are people the issues could begin to be resolved. Fantasies like this movie only prolong the hatred and incomprehension.";

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Spike Lee this overbudgeted very lengthy biopic Malcolm X tells most of every facet of his life as he begins as a gangster to becoming a Muslim convert to becoming an outspoken African American who wanted to believe that his fellow people should never be afraid to stand up to themselves and to be happy with the skin they have. In the early scenes we see Malcolm X Denzel Washington starting out as a criminal under his accomplice named West Indian Archie Delroy Lindo. He starts by robbing houses along with his assistant Shorty Spike Lee and joining his for the ride is a hot young blond named Sophia Kate Vernon with whom he chooses as a love interest over a much wellbehaved AfricanAmerican girl named Laura Theresa Randle. Later on Malcolm ends up incarcerated and opposing the Biblical teachings from Chaplain Gill Christopher Plummer and seems more on the side of AfricanAmerican Muslim convert Baines Albert Hall. Once he's discharged he become the top followers of the Nation of Islam under the influence of Elijah Muhammad Al Freeman Jr. Malcolm X becomes a charismatic celebrity which the white press so arbitrarily decided to lash out controversy towards this young radical. As his bravado increased proportionately the Nation of Islam became very envious about it while the Nation of Islam becomes a part of a scandal involving Elijah's illegitimate children.Malcolm eventually married Dr. Betty Shabazz Angela Bassett and raise three wonderful daughters. He then makes a religious journey to Mecca and declares that not all Caucasians are not entirely evil. When he returns to America he breaks ties with the Nation of Islam and establishes a rival church that fits the modern spirit at the time. The Nation of Islam did not take this very well and at the Audubon Hotel in Manhattan on February 21 1965 Malcolm X was beginning a speech when a disturbance takes shape Malcolm tries to calm everybody down and was gunned down one of the shooters was his former friend Baines. The movie itself was very high in terms of budget in spite of the very gargantuan production costs. Denzel was nominated at the Oscars for Best Actor in a leading role but sadly was ousted by Al Pacino for his role in Scent of a Woman. Washington had to wait several years before winning the Leading Actor Oscar in the film Training Day. The film itself was quite accurate in the time period clothes making it very authentic and the lingo spoken by the characters was very appropriate during the time period. The costume design was also in Oscar contention as well. The other high point was that many scenes were very well filmed especially the uproar during Malcolm X's assassination.Sure it was praised by many including myself there are still quite a few issues that didn't sit very well with me. Some of these were small nitpickings while others were much more bigger that truly hindered the film from being anything but perfect. Where to start was the singing performance by Miki Howard who was supposed to play the part of Billie Holiday but her voice doesn't even come close to even sounding like her. Anybody who listens to jazz and Big Band music know Holiday's familiar voice. It wouldn't have hurt if she just lipsynched from a Holiday soundtrack and it would have been more convincing. Lee really should have known better. The more obvious falsifications come from the character Sophia. She's hanging out at an all black girls nightclub and just freely throws herself in Malcolm's arms with no indication as to he is. I'm sorry but that is very illogical. It's just a scene designed to get male viewers' attention. It would never happen to you even if you have Washington's looks.It seems strange that the Nation of Islam has a hostile attitude to Washington who at the time looked decent wellcaring family man who loved his wife and kids. Did he munch on pork rinds at the time? Who knows?Another unanswered question stems from the scene where he stands up the cops after they unmercifully beat the tar out of a black man. Malcolm brings in a group of identically dressed black men to await for his command. Where did he find them and how did they fall into his lead? And what's the purpose of them acting like soldiers? To me they're there to look cool behind the camera if nothing else. And finally I must wonder what does Malcolm X himself truly stand for? He transforms from a thief in his early years to a radical Islamic radical and finally reconsiders his thoughts long enough and before you know it he's murdered. Sure his mission was to for equality but his execution was more radical rather than peaceful. He was separated from most of his life and wanted his fellow people not to anticipate with anything the white majority did and joined a church who eventually turned against him by having him killed. These quibbles are what brought this movie down. I think some editing should have been greatly desired as this movie went on too long and many scenes needed further explanation. But other than that the performances were excellent an Washington acted his heart here as the the other performers. But the illogical scenarios brought this film down from being an absolute masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " Sadly one of Lee's flattest film but still a story worth hearing and features a good performance from Washington";
	schema:reviewBody "Malcolm Little was a young man when his father was murdered by the KKK and he and his siblings were taken from their mother and separated.  As a young man he became a hustler and eventually a full robber with his friends before eventually getting 812 years in prison for his crimes.  While inside he learns the ways of Elijah Muhammad and coverts to Islam.  Once released he rises in the ranks of the Nation of Islam to be an uncompromising leader of the black movement  tackling white oppression head on.Lee does not want any question about the tone of this film.  Opening with footage of the Rodney King beating projected onto an American flag that chars before bursting into flames while Malcolm's American nightmare' speech is played over the top Lee leaves us in no doubt that this film will not step back from being provocative and incendiary.  Unlike many reviews on this site I will not review the politics of Malcolm X but I will try and view this as a film.  I do not need to agree with the stance of X to be interesting in this film  I did not watch this film to fight with it or get annoyed by it I watched it to listen to Lee tell the story of Malcolm X.Substance wise the film is too long  Lee did not allow the editors to be as ruthless as he should have been.  I can understand why though this was a labour of love and he must have felt that he needed that long to do the job. As a flow it works reasonably well although it is too baggy quite often but it is an interesting story nonetheless.  Many critics have lambasted the film for it's bias.  In that regard the only thing that surprised me was that they genuinely seemed surprised by this fact  what did they expect from Spike Lee?  However I don't believe that this is a fair accusation to make at Lee.  He tells the story in a fair light  he doesn't hide the double standards of the Nation of Islam nor does he spin the antiwhite teachings to paint Malcolm in a better light.  Of course Lee is going to bring his own problack politics to the film but that is his right and he doesn't rewrite history to serve himself.In fact I admired some of Lee's touches as they actually produced a more balanced view.  For example where Malcolm is talking to Betty about his thoughts on women Lee cuts to Malcolm being told the same opinion word for word by Muhammad  a brave move that implied the spoon feeding of his views that I didn't expect from Lee.  Of course the other way to look at it would be Lee excusing Malcolm's stance on women by pinning it on Muhammad and in fairness to that view Lee does tend to gloss over the NOI's view on woman's place.  The film is a little kind to Malcolm but not to the point where the absurd claims about bias and spin would really stick  well for the majority anyway.  I did feel that although it wasn't spin that the final 5 minutes of the film really went too far with the little kids all standing up saying I am Malcolm X' parallels with Jesus and then Mandella being wheeled out...now THAT bit I found to be unnecessary as it was not from Malcolm  it was heavy politicing from Lee himself in further evidence that he was knocked off his usual style by the weight of the material.In fact this stands out to me as being one of Lee's least stylish and slick films  only the early freer scenes of Malcolm's crime drink and dancing seem to be directed by a Spike Lee using the camera and the space.  For the most part Lee sits back and watches  apparently in total reverence of this subject and afraid to take away from the supposed importance of what the film is trying to do.  It is a shame because the overly long running time means that it desperately needed a spark at times and I did expect Lee at least to bring the film alive with visual flourishes.  Sadly like I say Lee's respect for his subject causes him to do nothing and worse still he includes some bits that just don't work  Muhammad's appearance in the cell is worst but Malcolm's trip to Mecca doesn't work as it is overlong and forced again as Lee stresses that Malcolm dropped the antiwhite stance. In regards this critics have unfairly accused Lee of trying to lessen Malcolm's stance and make it more acceptable ie change history but those of us who are a bit older know that we will learn things over our life and will not hold the same opinions as we did when we were 18 or 25 or 30. In the same way Malcolm lost his harsh teachings with age  this is the case it is not Lee trying to trick us.For all these reasons the film is greatly in debt to Denzel Washington. If it weren't for his engaging and powerful performance then this film would be very bland for the majority.  Happily then Washington rises to the role and deals with it's changes and development really well. He makes a charismatic leading man and it is difficult to imagine that anyone else could have done a better job with this role  or that the film would have worked without him.  The names of those involved is impressive but not all their performances are.  Bassett varies between being a shy little woman and having raging fights with her husband in neither mode does she convince. Freeman is also pretty comic  but part of the blame for that lies with Lee's portrayal of him floating in a cell is not a good look!.  Hall Lindo Randle McDaniel and Lee himself all do reasonably well in minor roles but the film belongs to Washington and it is just as well for the film's sake that he is up to the task.Overall this is an interesting film that is worth seeing as an INTRODUCTION to Malcolm X  however if you take your opinion from this film alone then you are doing yourself a disservice.  As a Spike Lee film it is surprisingly flat and lacking in the usual visual style that he brings it is a real shame but this labour of love is not one of his better films although it is not among his worst  it is rather pedestrian overlong and were it not for a charismatic performance from Washington would be a lot duller than the subject deserved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven the major winner of the Academy Awards in 1992 for best director and best film is good solid filmmaking. However Malcolm X produced and directed by Spike Lee and starring Denzel Washington in the title role is a bona fide masterpiecea 20th century film equivalent to a masterwork of the Renaissance. Certainly it may be unfair to evaluate the two films against each other but since one received much more acclaim than the other during the year of its release it begs comparison. However it's like comparing a Caravaggio with Michaelangelo's frescoes atop the Sistine Chapel. The first is certainly exceptional but the latter is a magnum opus. Malcolm X is Spike Lee's Sistine Chapel. Like Selznik's Gone with the Wind or Welles' Citizen Kane Malcolm X may be hard to top.The only thing equally as superb as Washington's acting is the directing and the script which is at once honest and compelling. Except for a coda at the end that seems at odds with the rest of the film the script is near perfect relying heavily on true accounts of Malcolm X's life instead of altering the story to fit prescribed entertainment values a bad habit of Hollywood filmmakers. Instead Lee and Washington rely on Malcolm X and his history as the guiding force behind the film. Many of the incidences portrayed in Malcolm X actually happened from his father being assassinated on railroad tracks to the young Malcolm being involved with drug dealing to his rise as a star among the Nation of Islam or socalled Black Muslims. In one scene that is history and not fiction Malcolm X orders his entourage of male associates to stand outside a hospital when a fellow Muslim Brother Johnson requires medical attention.Malcolm Little was an AfricanAmerican the son of an assassinated preacher whose family had sustained vicious threats from the KKK. As a young man he relocated to Harlem and became a streetwise hoodlum involved in crime gangs. Racketeering gambling prostitution and drug dealing were his first religion. Then after an incident with white girls that landed himself and his associate Shorty Spike Lee perfectly cast in jail he meets a member of a new religious organization claiming kinship with Muslims in the Middle East and reclaiming their African roots.Headed by the honorable Elijah Muhammad who had converted to Islam and brought the religion or at least his version of it to the United States as the Nation of Islam the socalled Black Muslims although they do not refer to themselves as such lures Malcolm into a new world of honesty compassion and purpose. To the their credit the religious organization gives Malcolm Little now renamed Malcolm X a sense of purpose an identity a loving community and rehabilitation from the vices that were destroying himself in Harlem.After his conversion he becomes a prominent voice among the sect a spokesperson for the honorable Elijah Muhammad and his message of religious determinism. Simultaneously they also preach dangerous messages including that all white folks are devils and that the honorable Elijah Muhammad is to be obeyed without question. As the spokesman of their cause against whites Malcolm X in some ways becomes the darker side of Martin Luther King Jr who propagated that proclaiming AfricanAmerican superiority was as sinful as proclaiming white superiority. The press dubbed Malcolm X the angriest man in America.Washington does more than just portray Malcolm X he becomes him. Washington I imagine must have studied footage of his speeches and spoken with people who knew him. Speeches of the real Malcolm X as compared to speeches in the film as enacted by Washington are almost indistinguishable. His performance ranks as one of the top two or three performances by an actor in the history of the performing arts and cinema up there with Ben Kingsly as Gandhi Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane Laurence Olivier as Hamlet and Vivian Leigh as Scarlet O'Hara.The turn in the film occurs when in the wake of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy Malcolm makes some illconceived remarks to the press. Malcolm X further learns that Elijah Muhammad is not practicing all that he preaches. The star of the socalled Black Muslims begins questioning not only his role but the integrity of the entire movement. He then makes a pilgrimage to Mecca required at least once in the lifetime of a Muslim. His pilgrimage changes many of his views.It's hard to describe this film without using many superlatives but if there was ever a film that deserved it it's Malcolm X. Washington and Lee do a tremendous job of neither vilifying nor idealizing Malcolm X the man. In retrospect on the man I think Malcolm X began to realize he could serve a higher purpose to help unify rather than divide the races. In the end Malcolm X began to encourage that dream but like Martin Luther King Jr his mission was cut short. As for the film it is an honest tribute to one of the most memorable figures of American history. And like the man himself the work may only be appreciated by later generations. Malcolm X is the embodiment of the American story.".

In retrospect on the man I think Malcolm X began to realize he could serve a higher purpose to help unify rather than divide the races. In the end Malcolm X began to encourage that dream but like Martin Luther King Jr his mission was cut short. As for the film it is an honest tribute to one of the most memorable figures of American history. And like the man himself the work may only be appreciated by later generations. Malcolm X is the embodiment of the American story.";

What better stage than this one about a man who leaves his Christian roots and converts to Islam? Here Lee goes out of his way to have the KKK mentioned several times and how they are good Christians. An accomplice to many of Lee's bigoted films unfortunately is the fine actor Denzel Washington. Check how often Washington and Lee collaborate on films and how many of them play the race card. Too bad because Denzel is a likable guy and a great actor. Lee is neither.At 201 minutes this a long film but an interesting one nonetheless. I can't say I was ever bored watching this. It's also beautifully photographed with some slick visuals. You can tell a lot of love went into this movie. Too bad Lee can't put this much effort into a biography of let's say Martin Luther King Mother Teresa or Billy Graham.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing  this movie as a kid and  pretty bored I was  but having recently caught it on the BBC  I was surprised how good it really is.Movie's basic outline concerns the development of the German V1 and V2 weapons and the subsequent  allied attempt  to infiltrate the underground factories at  Peenemnde where most of these these socalled Vergeltungswaffen' 'revenge' weapons were assembledRichard Anderson is the British government top official  who  puts  a team together Peppard Kemp and Courtenay posing as Dutch engineers volunteering to work for the Reich.As the spystory itself is undoubtedly heavily fictionalised the rest is pretty  historically accurate. Movie has an elaborate script featuring a plot full of twists and loopholes. instead of relying on big battle scenes or derringdo. Which is probably the reason  why it was a bit ignored by the public and critics alike on its release.  Moviegoers were expecting some straightforward   war epic as The battle of the Bulge The Heroes of Telemark or Von Ryan's Express all released in 1965 with plenty of action but seriously lacking in the historic credibility department.spoiler ahead Actors are solid but watch out for Anthony Quayle as an unusually shrewd German counterintelligence officer and the fact that some of the main stars get killed halfway the movie. Special effects in recreating the Vweapons  and their subsequent effect on London are definitly for that time very well executed.There are several subplots  one involving Sophia Loren but most interesting is the one with famous female  Nazi testpilot Hannah Reitsch Barbara Rtting as what must be only time  she is personified on the big screen.  Movie claims she actually had to test flight the V1 which was a not more then a flying bomb but the Germans  first wanted to use it as some sort of semikamikaze contraption with the pilot bailing out at the last minute.  After several killed pilots they wisely opted for a simple unmanned version.  These were launched en masse at London and other already liberated European cities. Incidentally the biopic The Glen Miller Story' 1954  has  an important scene with Miller's orchestra playing while being under attack of several V1's. Quite another beast was the V2  a real  ballistic missile  and a 'wonder' weapon  if there ever was one. It was  capable of going up in to the stratosphere and remained undetected by radar and reaching speeds of up to 2 mach and at that time impossible to detect and to shoot down.  A few hundreds were launched and did some important damage to major  supply lines especially the vital Belgian port of Antwerp  but never seriously endangered the allied offensives. The later ICBM's carrying nuclear warheads are all  based on the V2.major spoiler ahead Finally the produces  must have realised they had tot put some action sequences in it to justify the star cast and budget resulting  in a  very Bondlike  action sequence trying to prevent with the help of Bomber Command  a test flight of an improved V2  capable of reaching New York !.The British actually bombed Peenemunde several times which seriously delayed construction time and was instrumental in moving  almost the whole plant  underground as most German heavy industry after 1943.British Director Michael Anderson  is bestknown for another WWII tale The Dam Busters' also  the SFepic Logan's Run' and the TVseries The Martian Chronicles'  He was active until 2000still turning out the occasional TVmovie.George Peppard and Jeremy Kemp would team up again next year in the spectacular The Blue Max' this time not involving rockets  but WWI flying crates.See OC in its original Cinemascope format. Sadly the BBC choose to air in the socalled 'panandscan'version  seriously harming the colour and perspective.If you like this try  The battle of Britain'.I gave it an 8.".

The conclusion in England was that the V1 and V2 were wreaking havoc on London and the prime Minister Patrick Wymark called on his war ministry to design a plan to destroy them. Innically the secret operation was called 'Operation Bodyline' but changed for the movie under  Operation Crossbow. The idea was to select allied officers trained and educated as engineers fly them to Germany have them infiltrate the German War Machine and sabotage the entire Vrocket plant. What they did not harp on was that is was also considered a suicide mission. George Peppard Tom Courtenay and Jeremy Kemp play the incredibly courageous allied agents who must carry out the task. Anthony Quayle is superb as the traitorous EnglishGerman counter agent who's job it is to stop them. Richard Todd Paul Henreid Trevor Howard John Mills Richard Johnson and Sophia Loren round out the cast. The movie is incredible with actual WWII footage and surprisingly great dramatic acting.

Now I am a fan of Ms. Loren's films and have nothing against her performance in this film but she is only a minor character. She enters a scene and is dead a short time laterand that's about the size of her contribution to the movie. The advertising folks for this film should be shot as if you are watching the movie for her you'll be very disappointed.Now on to the movie itself despite the advertising this is a war espionage filmnot a romance. It's about as romantic as THE LONGEST DAY in fact. Nopedefinitely not a romance. Instead it's a film about Allied agents infiltrating the V1V2 bases at Penemunde. And in this light it is a very successful and engaging filmvery similar to THE HEROES OF TELMARK and other 60s epic war flicks. In fact it's better than Peppard's more famous war film THE BLUE MAX because it is NOT bogged down with a sappy romance and is pure wartime entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Operation Crossbow was quite a hit in its day but is not seen as being in the same league as films such as The Guns of Navarone or The Great Escape. Nevertheless it is a very worthy film on many levels.Firstly the cast is uniformly excellent with supporting roles taken by some of Britain's acting luminaries such as Trevor Howard John Mills and Richard Todd. The leading man is George Peppard who plays the role with his characteristically understated charm and when called upon a very believable physicality. Some have been critical of the fact that Sophia Loren is billed as a costar and has very limited screen time. However her performance as an innocent caught up in a desperate and finally unfairly cruel situation is worth watching. So too is the performance of her killer played by Lilli Palmer who embodies the emotional control deceptiveness resourcefulness and cool ruthlessness required by resistance contacts whose every move was potentially their last. Bouquets to Barbara Rutting who plays the real life character of Hannah Reitsch with a steely resolve and belief that had me looking up the life story of the Nazi test pilot. She remained a dedicated National Socialist until her death and was highly critical of postwar Germany and Germans. She was appalled at the fact that German soldiers by the late 60's were allowed to wear beards and that Germany was in her words now a nation of bankers and car builders. She won many awards for her feats of aviation after the war. Other historical figures such as Constance Babington Smith a key figure in identifying V1 rocket sites and Professor Lindemann who dismissed the Nazi rocket program as being a hoax are to my knowledge faithfully portrayed by Sylvia Syms and Trevor Howard respectively.The pace of the film is another highlight. The story is told through a number of points of view including the Nazi rocketry program and its own attempts at espionage and counter espionage. Almost every scene has an element of suspense  a mini story within the story. There are also some moments of humour seamlessly laced into the drama. Well done to the editor who was faced with the complex task of melding so many story elements into a very cohesive whole.Lastly the action scenes and in particular the final destruction of the rocket production plant is comparable to any such destroy the villain's lair scene including those in the Bond series. The stunts and special effects stand up very well after almost 50 years.".

Unfortunately the rest of the movie is very talky and while serviceable lacks strong visual excitement. The British high command must thwart German rocket development as V1s rain down on London. They send in a specialized team of commandos to infiltrate the rocket base and stop the threat at the source. George Peppard From Hell to Victory Jeremy Kemp THE BLUE MAX and Tom Courtenay KING RAT are the commandos in question. The movie runs 2 hours and the first half hour is dedicated to setting the stage. The leads aren't even introduced for 30 minutes and they only appear in about half of the film total. Each actor does fine but is offered little material to work with. Anthony Quayle THE GUNS OF NAVARONE plays a British double agent who is really an evil Nazi Richard Todd THE LONGEST DAY has a small cameo as a British intelligence officer Lilli Palmer is a German housekeeper Patrick Wymark Where Eagles Dare is almost unrecognizable as Churchill and Richard Johnson The Fifth Day of Peace is the minister of defense.On the bad side of the coin Producer Carlo Ponti's wife Sophia Loren is onhand for a really pointless part. She plays the wife of the scientist Peppard is impersonating and complicates matters for a time for no purpose other than to suck up time until she is simply taken out and shot by the resistance. She plays the sappy role to the core but it's still a waste of talent and good looks. Trevor Howard VON RYAN'S EXPRESS has a horrendous role as a skeptical scientist. It's easily his worst acting role ever and you can tell he hates his part. The action scenes are  for the most part  limited to the final act. There are some great suspenseful sequences of V1s raining down on London but these are hampered by some secondrate miniatureanimation work pretty bad even for its day. The last 15 minutes with Peppard and Kemp holding a huge underground factory at bay is excellently filmed. Perfectly edited with great Ron Goodwin music the long scene is a perfect example of how a suspense sequence should run. When the factory does go up it's by a mere miracle  and looks fabulous. Filled with awe striking special effects including a rocket blowing up while launching detonating jet fuel and men trying in vain to escape an exploding tomb are mindnumbing.Turner Classic Movies gives the film proper treatment showing it in widescreen format from a beautiful master print. Everything looks and sounds perfect. The letterboxing is necessary to absorb the scope of the big action scenes and take in the scenery which fills the screen in others. The German scenes are adequately subtitled in the bottom letterbox band.Most critics give this film a topnotch rating and I fail to understand why. I used to think it was a superb movie until I started writing this review and realized there's nothing really great about. Even as an action movie it lacks the stunts of WHERE EAGLES DARE the strong characters of THE LIBERATORS and the scope of THE LONGEST DAY. It still works just fine but it's no more than an ordinary waraction film with a good Ron Goodwin music score and little else to offer of any interest. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the movie on TCM and was gripped by the well built tension until the gripping end. Basically a good story how the courage and self sacrifice of English volunteers defeated the terror of the V2 rockets posed on England and the further proceedings of the war. I saw it a 2nd time and had to wonder about some holes and a lot of strange additions to the straight forward story 1. Celebration of German engineering and especially German Fighting Womens Courage impersonated by B. Ruetting to make that terror weapon work she flies it to work out constructional weaknesses although 4 pilots have died before trying the same along with wasting some familiar faces P. Henreid H. Dantine 2.

I saw it a 2nd time and had to wonder about some holes and a lot of strange additions to the straight forward story 1. Celebration of German engineering and especially German Fighting Womens Courage impersonated by B.

	schema:headline " Good history in fiction thriller about WW II arms race";
	schema:reviewBody "Operation Crossbow is a fictional movie based on historical events of World War II. It's a historical look at Hitler's program to develop rocket weapons and the Allied efforts to foil the Germans. The plot has enough intrigue and action to make the film entertaining. And the bombing scenes keep the sense of urgency about the race between the Allies and the Germans the last two years that would determine the war's outcome. The film has a cast of notable movie stars of the day but I think only a couple stand out for their performances. Trevor Howard is excellent as Professor Lindemann and Tom Courtenay is very good and convincing as Robert Henshaw. The real pluses for this film are four. First it's a reasonable portrayal of historical events and some key people of the time. Second it has excellent camera work. Third it has very good recreations of the German rockets and testing sites and of the bombing scenes in London and the air raids on the German sites. Fourth it uses some actual war film footage sparingly.During World War II Operation Crossbow was the code name for the overall Allied effort to destroy the German rocket and longrange bombing projects. It began in early 1943 under the code name Bodyline when Allied planes photographed a V2 rocket site in northern France. The code name changed that fall. Some of the film characters are based on real people and use their names. Others are amalgams of people. The roles of the main stars aren't real people. Besides Winston Churchill other British leaders portrayed were real. Richard Johnson plays Duncan Sandys who was in charge of Operation Crossbow. He had been wounded while fighting with British forces in Norway after Germany invaded that country in early 1940. He also was Churchill's soninlaw at the time. In this movie Sandys often is at odds with the chief science adviser to his group Professor Lindemann. Frederick Lindemann was a real person and the chief science adviser to the British war effort. He was a close friend of Winston Churchill and made significant contributions to the Allied war efforts. But he believed that the German rocket program was a hoax. Another leading scientific adviser was Reginald V. Jones with whom Sandys often clashed. It seems that the film writers combined the two British scientists under the character of Lindemann. Constance Babington Smith played by Sylvia Syms was another very real person in the film. She was the British photo interpreter who first spotted a German rocket site from aerial photos. Another real character was Hanna Reitsch played by Barbara Rutting. Reitsch was a renowned German aviatrix who set many flying records. She was a test pilot for the Nazis and was the only woman to receive the Iron Cross first class. She survived the war and set many glider records. Reitsch died at age 67 in August 1979 at Frankfurt  then West Germany. MGM's British film group did an excellent job recreating the German Peenemnde rocket research and testing site. The filming was done along the Norfolk coast NNE of London. Its North Sea location and coastline probably very closely resembled the real German site along the Baltic Sea. Watching this film again I understood how the British early on were concerned about Germany's advances in weapons. After the war and through the 1950s there was a general sense in the U.S.  and perhaps much of the world  that the Germans were generally superior in the fields of science and engineering. I grew up with that notion. My dad had served in the Army in Europe during WW II and I later served in the Army in Germany during the Cold War. The Germans continued to excel in cameras tape recorders other electronic production and automobiles. But with the passage of time and greater public awareness of recent history we now know more about the seeming German prowess in the sciences. In fact most of technology and development of the German rocket program had been pioneered almost two decades before by an American scientist Robert H. Goddard 18821945. Today Goddard is recognized as the father of modern rocketry and the father of the space age. How ironic that when he died in 1945 many still doubted and dismissed him and his work. Yet he had launched the world's first liquidfueled rocket in March 1926 and he and his team had launched 34 rockets from then until 1941. He was working with grant monies and obtained more than 200 patents. But much of his work took place during the depression. And no one  the U.S. government included seemed interested in all the possibilities that Goddard had envisioned from rocket science and achievements. My DVD of Operation Crossbow had a 10minute short special with it A Look Back at Crossbow. It has some early film clips of Goddard's first attempts to launch rockets. One can see these today on YouTube. This short documentary noted that Germany collected all of the Goddard research achievements for a mere 10 cents per copy from the U.S. Patent Office. And Adolf Hitler had his Nazi regime embark on a huge RD program for weapons superiority shortly after he came to power in 1932. The rest is history. Another American also had much to do with Japan's recovery after the war. W. Edwards Deming was a scientist whose work Japanese industry took seriously. In just two decades Japan grew to become a world power based on its high quality and innovative production. Japan's industry created the Deming Prize in 1951. President Reagan awarded Deming the National Medal of Technology in 1987. But just as with Robert Goddard Deming's work wasn't widely recognized in the U.S. until after his death in 1993. And that's another whole story.".

	schema:headline " Celebrate your Freedom ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Paint It Yellow. Oops.that's suppose to be Rang De Basanti.. Well that's exactly the director tries to convey. Its about today us and our present yet the similarities we have from the Preindependence era. The Genx who knows MacD but still prefers the Dhaba Paranthas with sweet Lassi. However they restrict their national values only to food and nothing more. Its not a run of the mill stuff with 6 six romantic songs couple of foreign locales and then finally some emotional drama.. No no no.. Rang Deis a Cult movie. It is more of an introspection a food for our thought process. It makes us think as to how should we actually celebrate our freedom. I was really moved by some of the ending lines by the narrator I thought there are 2 types of people in the world one who die crying and other who move away in silence but today I learned there is third genre people who go laughing. That says it all Rang De is definitely a very brave and innovative attempt by the director and for that matter he has selected a near perfect cast. However veterans like Om Puri and Anupam Kher looked disposed. All the characters grow gradually in the film and make you think their way. Everyone is given enough space to justify their talent. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra is a director of the new emerging Indian cinema he always tries to bring in something very different. I was really impressed by his last attempt in 2001 for Aks Amitabh Bachchan and Manoj Bajpai  and he definitely has succeeded in making another fabulous master piece. The highlight of the movie is the great use of cinematography techniques. Its probably for the first time in Indian cinema that juxtaposing has been used with such a great effect. The way each character gradually immerses into scenes from the past leaves you fantasizing about the hard work that has gone in the background to create this both technically and on the part of the actor.The movie starts on a very high spirit reflecting today's youth mindset who believe that patriotism is something that looks good in history chapters and today's world is far ahead of all that they would prefer to go boozing and dancing rather than thinking on any of those lines. The way the campus scenes are shown really makes everyone go down the memory lanes of beautiful college days. This is followed by some intriguing drama and events which turns the life of a group of buddies upsidedown altogether.The film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within a freedom to think in one's own way. A.R. Rehman doesn't need any introductions and he is surely one of the most original music directors we have in the country.The brilliance of Aamir Khan is something very difficult to narrate he has proved it umpteen number of times that he is truly the most versatile actor in the industry. His comic timing in the first part is better than anything seen in recent past. He is extremely fluent even with difficult Punjabi tongue twisters and the acting prowess he has shown would be very difficult to match by anyone around. He appears so natural and his complete look with new hairstyle which is now part of his every new movie gives a very striking combination.Well the most wanting part of the whole thing has been the script to certain extent it appears very loose in the second half and at times gives a droning feel. Few new ideas presented by the author looked halfbaked. However it has been the technical expertise of the director who managed to save the things with some outstanding camera work and editing.Rang De  is for sure a must watch movie it doesn't have any preaching but still it will force you to think once. As they say it There are two primary choices in life to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them. I believe most of us want to bring about the changes without doing anything so its time to think again folks and take some responsibility lets Paint It Yellow ".

The storyline though is stretched a bit we Indians need that but the message is loud and clear. Throughout the movie a great sense of humor is maintained.The performances are all excellent. I have given this movie a rating of 10 solely on the basis of the originality of the story.

	schema:reviewBody "It's about time there has been a Bollywood film about the youth of India. Granted these are college kids and not the average Indian adolescent who sometimes foresakes education for work they are a good representatives of young Indians both in the diaspora and in India.Casting is great. Each character pursues their emotion when their emotions are pursued by circumstances. They express both the emotions at surface and those sunken to be brought out by a situational tide. And they do it with truthfulness. Although some of the elder cast could have been utilized more the focus on the youth and parallels with past figures are well orchestrated. The character that plays Bhagat Singh Amir Khan and Sonia are incredible. Each has their own spotlight where they nudge us from complacency and create an unstable sense of urgency.This is the best screenplay I have seen thus far in Indian media. Although BLACK had great language through what we saw on the screen this movie has shown the progress of film making abroad. Finally! The depth and character development we need are supplied with not just turn of events but the turn of the screen. We don't need just words to understand a character. This movie shows how well a change in scene isn't a transition but an entity that holds together a character and emotion. And repetition! And repetition of words dialogue and attitude through the parallels was very inspiring.The general storyline of the movie is good. I say good because parts of the youth's leisure sometimes can get annoying as well as the camerawork that accompanies it. At times I wanted to push the film forward and get to the point. But that's the point! Point being that we need to understand the choppy nature of the first half because chops or not these characters are transient figures who don't realize their role in life until they have experienced the wholeness of reality. It's interesting that the wholeness comes from reflections of the past. The use and reuse of certain scenes are important in showing the character growth built upon experience.AR Rahman's music captures the reality unbelievably. We have dance numbers but they're pathetic belligerent kicking and hand waving. Isn't that what we usually do when we're drunk anyways? Although the use of the music is off sometimes and abrupt the emotion that each peace carries relates so well to the circumstances. The best use in my opinion being Luka Chuppi by Lata M and AR Rahman. The symbiosis between the lyrics and the events on screen are incredible. Dramatic irony at it's best.The cinematography of this film is great in the majority of the film. The few annoyances in cinematography come with the patchy scenes with the first half during these leisure rides and early in the second half. But besides that  the cinematographer and director have made outstanding use of the diagonal view. The lines and profiles of people and country are so well placed that you begin to understand how crooked life's path can be. None of us have a straight line ahead of us. What makes me enjoy the movie the most is the humor and cause. You'd think with all the aforementioned details that this is a sobering movie about crooked lives and emotions and such but the characters have fun. Sue's project is hilarious and the use of extras was really earnest. It is very much how I would be acting with friends of course only when drunk like they are in certain parts. The cause is very important to this film and it makes it a powerful film because it has this cause.I'm 22. I just recently visited India. I understood and was confused by the youth of India and this film portrays the ambiguity of India well. There are no answers there are only actions. And this is what they strive to do in the film. Usually Bollywood movies lose their purpose come the 1st dance number but the truth of this film speaks more than numbers. It is a film about what comes after pure white innocence of our youth. And it asks that we paint the difference.".

	schema:headline " Film Review Rang De Basanti India Awakens";
	schema:reviewBody "Film ReviewRang De BasantiIndia AwakensBy Nidhi KathuriaRating 'Rang De Basanti' gratifies you with uncomplicated almost melodious humor it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word 'go' this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. 'Rang De Basanti' is not a clich patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting melodrama reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit Aamir Khan Atul Kulkarni Sharman Joshi Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career's best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What 'Mangal Pandey' couldn't do for Aamir Khan 'Rang De Basanti' does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn't have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her 'pucca Punjaban' character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue a filmmaker from London who wants to make a documentary in India called 'Young Guns of India' based on heroes of PreIndependence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh Azad Bismil Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice a blast that could be heard by our generation to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled 'Rang De Basanti'. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music A.R. Rehman after the wishy washy music of 'Mangal Pandey' completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well that's what the film hopes to achieve on some level without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours' souls and no matter where we are and what we do we love our country.The Story A young English filmmaker Sue Alice Payton arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia Soha Ali Khan. After grilling auditioning sessions when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all she comes across DJ Aamir Khan Karan Siddharth Sukhi Sharman Joshi Aslam Kunal Kapoor and Lakshman Pandey Atul Kulkarni and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles.

	onyx:emotionText "Film ReviewRang De BasantiIndia AwakensBy Nidhi KathuriaRating 'Rang De Basanti' gratifies you with uncomplicated almost melodious humor it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word 'go' this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. 'Rang De Basanti' is not a clich patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting melodrama reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey which is the USP of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Warning This is not a movie for he faint hearted or for escapists looking for brainless entertainment.But if you belong to neither of those categories then this one's for you. As a viewer I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Sure Aamkir Khan was known for quality cinema and all but Mangal Pandey had come as a huge disappointment and I was thinking that this would follow the same lines. Thankfully I was wrong.One of the most different movies ever seen on the Indian Screen it is a novel experience for the average moviegoer. One cannot really categorize this movie as Action or Romance or Patriotic etc. However it falls under one category perfectly Cult. This movie is sure to achieve Cult status especially among the youth. It has scenes from the lives of Bhagat Singh and other Revolutionaries the sepia tone give it a really authentic feel as well as the state of the current youth. But what really makes this movie stand out is how it makes a successful comparative study between the Incidents and Events in the Lives of our PreIndependence Heroes and the Lives of the Modern Youth of India. As this comparison is brought out especially in the PostInterval Portions it makes your skin crawl. Also the climax is an exhilarating experience though it will meet with diverse reactions. The Story Sue Alice Patton in an extremely commendable role is a British girl who wants to make a movie on Indian Revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad on the basis of the experiences of her grandfather who was an Officer in British India. Due to shortage of money she convinces a mix bag of college students and slackers to act in her movie Aamir Siddharth Sharman Soha Ali Khan Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor. While making the movie she becomes good friends with them and even gets smitten with D.J. Aamir.Now these guys have a friend who is an Air Force Pilot R. Madhavan whose MiG crashes due to its faulty parts. The entire group is devastated. What angers them further is the Defence Minister's Mohan Agashe accusation that the pilot was an amateur. But what really pushes them to the edge is when the Police attacks their peaceful protest march ruthlessly not sparing wither man woman or child. They decide to take revenge....By killing the Defence Minister. When they succeed in their endeavour they are shocked to find the Minister being called a Martyr ad being awarded the Bharat Ratna. They decide tat the country needs to know the truth. For this they take over an All India Radio Station to announce the truth over the radio. What follows is the tense climax that keeps the viewers guessing till the very end.Analysis The movie has been treated in a very contemporary manner. The dialogues have been penned beautifully. The script is tight. If the first half is filled with light moments then the second half has its share serious scenes. The Punjabi Dialogues come as a breath of fresh air.Apart from the main story there are a number of subplots that are included that raise many issues. Be it the views of a Hindu Fundamentalist about Muslims or the views of a Muslim of the treatment given to his community in the country it makes the viewer think. There is also the love story between Soha Ali Khan and R. Madhavan as well as the controversy regarding the faulty parts in the MiG airplanes purchased by India and the money made by selfish industrialist Anupam Kher...wasted and Ministers. The Music is Excellent. After a hiatus we see A.R. Rahman in full form. The Title Track gives the viewer a sense of elation and the colourful picturisation leaves you wanting more. Also other songs like 'Tu Bin Bataye' 'Paathshala' 'LukaChhupi' and 'Roobaroo' leave an impact on you.Full Marks to Rakesh MEhra for the treatment of the subject. There are a number of scenes that give you chills like1 D.J.'s breakdown at Sue's house after returning from the hospital. 2 Madhavan's last remains brought to his house for his mother and friends. 3 Atul Kulkarni's delivery of the poem 'Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna' as Ramprasad Bismil. 4 the Jalianwalah Bagh Massacre sequence with replacing the Defence Miniter for General Dyer to explain its contemporary relevance.However what really makes this movie a true accomplishment is the performances. All of the above would be nonexistent if it wasn't for the stellar performance given by the entire cast. Aamir Khan is excellent as the care free Punjabi but he doesn't steal all the attention. He is supported by equally riveting performances by Siddharth Kunal Kapoor Sharman Joshi and Atul Kulkarni. Soha Ali Khan is a revelation compared to her prior films. Her breakdown on hearing of Madhavan's death is one on the most amazing scenes from the movie. Alice Patton is equally good. Her Hindi is sure to strike a chord with the Indian cinegoers. Also absolutely amazing performances come from Waheedaji and Kirronji. Both lend brilliant support to the movie. One the whole this movie is a novel experience. A definite recommendation to every youth of India as well as the World. It is a movie that gives you fodder for thought. Also it is one of those few movies that actually lives up to its tagline A Generation Awakens.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movies we view come and go releasing from our minds however this particular movie left behind a mark in my heart. It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever viewed in my life. I find it pretty ridiculous when such a movie is compared to LRMB.What i favored most about this extravagant movie was that there was an attempt to conveying a message and the message is revealed very thoroughly. Human beings tend to complain about negative occurrences ministers corruption unemployment etc...Yet rarely any one steps up to change what's wrong and eventually nothing progresses. This movie encourages you to make a difference in society and change what is erroneous. EVerything about this movie is just absolutely unique  the screenplay the colors the performances the songs...EVERYTHING. All actors played their roles topnotch. Every actor had an impact in the movie and should've received equal credit from my perspective. Amir Sharman Siddharth Kunal Atul Soha Waheeda every one stepped up to the plate. Some actors were over lookedsuch as Alice Patten and Sharman Joshi. Alice had dedication towards her work  her Hindi was very well fluent and so were her expressions. Sharman did a great job acting innocently comic. Soha's reaction after Ajay's death was natural  she fitted into the very skin of her character. Siddharth is a fantastic actor and hopefully will make it big in Bollywood one day he handled his character to the maximum level. Amir as usual did not disappoint. He was awesome and very authentic. The movie was modern  so today and it was something that we can easily relate to. Honestly when I first purchased the movie last year I thought it was an overrated movie just because of Amir Khan's comeback nonetheless after watching it I was proved wrong. It was just wow beyond words. I couldn't manage not to cry at the end. THe quotes in the movie were just lovely and has the possession of very deep meanings.Overall this movie deserves a 10 without any questioning. It is a message to the youth of the present era. Get out there  change the negative aspects of the world. This movie DOES NOT ONLY GO FOR INDIANS however all other countries in south Asia which contains issues such as corruption over population and so forth. I am a Bengali and the movie impressed me as much as any Indian  because the situations in Bangladesh is alike. Ministers are stealing the country's money and they are not caring about the people or doing anything to improve the country. People suffer each day  due to their very actions. It taught me that we should do something about my country's political groups and Prime Ministers. WHOEVER DID NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE MISSING  go watch it! D.".

It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever viewed in my life. I find it pretty ridiculous when such a movie is compared to LRMB.What i favored most about this extravagant movie was that there was an attempt to conveying a message and the message is revealed very thoroughly. Human beings tend to complain about negative occurrences ministers corruption unemployment etc...Yet rarely any one steps up to change what's wrong and eventually nothing progresses. This movie encourages you to make a difference in society and change what is erroneous.

	schema:reviewBody "This film's absurdly high rating insinuates all that is wrong with today's urban Indian youth. Before I get into all the bashing I have to give credit where it is due. I have to agree that the movie is technically strong the cinematography is charming Rahman's music is one of his best editing is crisp and the acting is mostly above par and a few outstanding. Where the movie fails is in its core theme and the message it tries to convey. A group of college students who are indifferent to the problems of the country as most of us are suddenly one day gear up to kill the Defence Minister of the country because they 'think' he is responsible for their friend'san airforce pilot death. They are utterly convinced that their friend died because of the mediocre parts that went into the manufacturing of the crashed MiG plane despite having no evidence to establish this whatsoever. They never for once bother to think that the minister could be innocent. What is sickening is the way their act is hailed at the end as if it was the most heroic thing ever done on the face of the earth. The movie constantly compares these halfboiledattitude youth with the revolutionaries of the Indian freedom struggle which I think is an insult to those real heroes. The plot holes are many. The attack on the people peacefully protesting by the police in the presence of media is simply ridiculous to be real. Now icing on the cake was the climaxwhen these 'nationalists' break into a radio station to confess and justify their action. I am not sure of what did these guys think would happen after they confess and allege the minister of corruption on AIR? The country would rise against the government?? when clearly it didn't happen when the innocent people were beaten black and blue in the presence of media! We Indian youth are susceptible to the mobmentality. The director has exploited it thoroughly. Now this movie has gained the cult status among the urban dudes because as a quote in the movie goes it is easy to grumble about all the ills in the country and kill its minister than changing the society for the good say by becoming an IASIPS officer which requires quite a struggle than stupidly throwing up your life that serves nothing.PS I would have given this movie a 610. But 1 is just a feeble attempt to bring it to its deserving position.".

The film is a good mix of fun and message. It delivers the message without loosing the essential fun factor. Amir Khan's one liners keep you alive all through. As expected Amir Khan steals the show but the second leads stand out as well with some good performances. Cinematography direction and screenplay are of first grade. This one also marks A R Rehman's return to form with some marvellous songs and background score. I would have rated it 1010 only if the climax was handled a bit better. The end of the story leaves a lot to be desired and the moral of the story is not very clear by its climax. A genuine honest and good attempt nevertheless.

As it progressed on i realized well Aamir has done better than Mangal Panday. Then after the intermission i said hmmmm...good film and i don't say that easily. But when the film ended i thought Finally symbolism has returned to Indian cinema and Aamir has regained his status as a superstar. Aamir Khan easily outclasses himself and all the other performances in 2006 and breathtakingly acts very naturally. This performance is unlike any of his previous ones and certainly the best performance by an actor of his age. I'd even say that he outclasses Mr. Bachan in Black and Paa. For this two reasons are present. No.1 both of the roles by Amitabh in Black and Paa were overplayed and both films were copies from two very good Hollywood flicks. The rest of the cast is also very well put together and each and everyone pulls off a decent performance. The soundtrack of the film is perfect for its mood and this is coming from someone who does not under any circumstances acknowledge A.R Rahman as the Mozart of India. I'd recommend this film to anyone who has taste for good cinema and who loves films with a message because at the end the message in the film is what makes it memorable. Hats off to Rakesh Omprakash Mehra Aamir Khan and A.R. Rahman and a memorable thank you to the supporting cast that made this film the best of 2006 in my opinion.".

If Yuva was the ignition RDB is the Spark that lights the fire.A script that is almost flawless and executed with unimaginable comparisons to the preindependence era is extremely hard to portray. Also to grasp the audience by the throat from the word 'Go' in this over critical world is stunning.I've watched RDB about a dozen times now and I must say it is equally powerful for the message that needs to be conveyed regarding doing rather than gossipping and being a spectator or passenger in the so called 'system'. We have all been there we have all done it and are still doing it but RDB makes you more than just aware of it.A virtual tag line Koi Bhi Desh perfect nahi hota Usey Behther Banaana Padtha hai is quite adorable and delivered by different personalities with exactly opposite ideals at different times in the movie. Was it right to eliminate a bad powerful person? Maybe Not but it is definitely a way to get the QUICK attention of the ever so unfocused youth of India myself included.R.O.P.Mehra has presented RDB for the youth and done full justice to them. At the end of RDB one definitely feels that he has had some kind of rubin with the government regarding MIG's. He seems to have put his heart and soul into RDB. I wouldn't be surprised if his closest kin was one of the pilots affected due to bad parts in the MIG's.Aamir Khan as DJ short for Diljeet has essayed a role that is funny yet focused comic yet concerned silly yet sensible and a loafer who becomes a leader. The complexity of this character is probably lost because of the ease at which Aamir is able to become DJ. Being a Bombayite to transform into this ever so likable Dilliite with that awesome Punjabi oye pehen de takke.. transformation was dumbfounding. On the other hand he is Chandrashekar Azard. No Doubt.Siddharth as Karan Singhania  Bhagat Singh is a revelation. A calmness shown by him breathing life into a character who just Loathes India and becomes the voice of the 5 man Rebels with a cause is sometimes too hot to handle. The emotions and the sincerity of the character are given more than enough respect by Siddharth. He will go a long way in handling intense roles very easily.Soha Ali Khan as Sonia urf Durga Bhabhi is fresh and practical. She does have lots of similarities to Saif Ali Khan but still stands out as her own woman not just a Sharmila Tagor or SAK clone.Madhavan in his short role as Lft. Ajay is very effective and has a magnetic presence that the group of friends look up to. His chemistry with Soha is simply natural.Sharman Joshi as Sukhi has perfect comic timing and is a great sidekick to DJ's jokes. He does show his ability of serious shades when the film turns into a fighting for a cause saga from a light one.Now the newcomer that I think will get a lot of looks due to his personality and charisma is Kunal Kapoor as Aslam. His difficulty in dealing with a petty family clinging to old virtues and his loyalty to his friends is just too perfect. His physique can only add to his characters in the movies to come and he could be the perfect raw material for directors who want the next Angry Sensitive and Sensible young man.I just hope RDB does not stay just a movie but truly awakens India. This one is a 1010 for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra merges two plots in RANG DE BASANTI. The first is about a group of friends their bonding the carefree lifestyle they lead. The second plot pertains to the past when freedom fighters sacrificed their lives during the era before independence. Mehra draws parallels between Indians ruled by the British and Indians ruled by corrupt politicians today. The message is subtle at first but echoes piercingly before it reaches its finale. The transition of the five friends from meaningless to meaningful existence is done brilliantly.Rang De Basanti has a story to tell is not a ripoff of some exotic film but the story is told at a leisurely pace. Is it a patriotic film? Yes and no. Is it a fun film? Yes and no. Is it a serious film? Yes and no. Does it have a neat ending? Yes and no.Thats the beauty of Rang de Basanti. Its the film which shows that bollywood is indeed coming of age.A R Rahman lives to his reputation in Rang De Basanti. Binod Pradhan's cinematography is lyrical and Adman Prasoon Joshi evokes the youth lingo with his dialogues. Sameer Chanda's art direction and Allan Amin's action sequences are its other strong points.Aamir gets into the skin of the character and delivers a knockout performance from start to end but the film has more gems when it comes to performances Siddharth is excellent Atul Kulkarni is fantastic Soha Ali Khan is a complete revelation Kunal Kapoor is natural and Sharman Joshi delivers a powerful performance.Alice Patten is brilliant and besides delivering a flawless performance her style of speaking Hindi is sure to win a lot of hearts. Madhavan is likable. Waheeda Rehman is graceful as ever. Both Om Puri and Anupam Kher don't get much scope. Kiron Kher is exceptional yet again. Mohan Agashe Steven Mckintosh K.K. Raina and Lekh Tandon are adequate.But ultimately despite sharing the screen space with others this is an Aamir Khan film. And the actor playing a character 15 years younger lives the role conveying the right amount of mischief as in the banter in Hindi with Sue without realizing she knows the language carefree flippancy earnestness insecurity even breaking down on screen and keeping his infectious laughter till the very end.Well in the movie its said  I always thought that there are two kinds of men those who met their deaths screaming and those who die in silence. And then I met the third kind Similar type of feeling triggered in my mind too There are movies made with some moralsome underlying message some are pure entertainers not making much sense. Yesterday i came to know about the third kind...........that leaves you with a thought a thought...................".

The transition of the five friends from meaningless to meaningful existence is done brilliantly.Rang De Basanti has a story to tell is not a ripoff of some exotic film but the story is told at a leisurely pace. Is it a patriotic film? Yes and no. Is it a fun film? Yes and no. Is it a serious film? Yes and no. Does it have a neat ending? Yes and no.Thats the beauty of Rang de Basanti. Its the film which shows that bollywood is indeed coming of age.A R Rahman lives to his reputation in Rang De Basanti. Binod Pradhan's cinematography is lyrical and Adman Prasoon Joshi evokes the youth lingo with his dialogues. Sameer Chanda's art direction and Allan Amin's action sequences are its other strong points.Aamir gets into the skin of the character and delivers a knockout performance from start to end but the film has more gems when it comes to performances Siddharth is excellent Atul Kulkarni is fantastic Soha Ali Khan is a complete revelation Kunal Kapoor is natural and Sharman Joshi delivers a powerful performance.Alice Patten is brilliant and besides delivering a flawless performance her style of speaking Hindi is sure to win a lot of hearts. Madhavan is likable. Waheeda Rehman is graceful as ever. Both Om Puri and Anupam Kher don't get much scope. Kiron Kher is exceptional yet again. Mohan Agashe Steven Mckintosh K.K. Raina and Lekh Tandon are adequate.But ultimately despite sharing the screen space with others this is an Aamir Khan film. And the actor playing a character 15 years younger lives the role conveying the right amount of mischief as in the banter in Hindi with Sue without realizing she knows the language carefree flippancy earnestness insecurity even breaking down on screen and keeping his infectious laughter till the very end.Well in the movie its said  I always thought that there are two kinds of men those who met their deaths screaming and those who die in silence. And then I met the third kind Similar type of feeling triggered in my mind too There are movies made with some moralsome underlying message some are pure entertainers not making much sense. Yesterday i came to know about the third kind...........that leaves you with a thought a thought...................";

The movie very aptly captures the lives of our youth but more importantly goes further than portraying a carefree hedonistic lifestyle by providing them important issues to deliberate on. Like how to pro actively deal with corruption and how to respect the sacrifices made by our predecessors to achieve our almost takenforgranted independence. Also the issue of equanimity between Hindus and Muslims is dealt with very well. The camerawork is fantastic. Great scenes captured from Delhi and other places. A lot of sharp humor interspersed with the typical Punjabistyle wit acted by Aamir Khan. Sidharth Narayan and Kunal Kapoor have done their roles proud. Soha Ali Khan is as cute as can be and does a very mature role. Sharman Joshi however is the pick of the lot as his role involves a lot of grey areas and changing character. In all a MUST SEE for Indians everywhere! I'd give this movie a perfect 10!".

	schema:headline " Not exactly bad but lacks the magic of the original";
	schema:reviewBody "The Brave Little Toaster was a film I saw many times in my childhood. It came out the year after I was born but the two sequels it spawned came out much later in the late 90's and I didn't even know about them until years later when I found them on IMDb. Just over a week ago I watched the 1987 original again for what I believe was my second viewing since the 90's. After that I intended to finally watch the two directtovideo sequels. Apparently The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue was released after the other sequel The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars but takes place before it. For that reason I decided to watch this one first. While I think it's better than some fans of the original do it didn't surprise me when I saw that it was another inferior sequel.The appliances' master Rob is now a college student studying to become a veterinarian and is now nearing the end of his final semester. He still has his entire treasured collection of appliances from when he was a kid Toaster Blanky Kirby Lampy and Radio and keeps them with the exception of the lamp at the veterinary hospital where he treats animals. Rob is almost ready to graduate as he is very close to finishing his thesis on the computer when suddenly he loses it all when the computer crashes and he hasn't saved any of it! It doesn't help when his relationship with his girlfriend Chris runs into trouble. Meanwhile Mack Rob's bitter lab assistant is secretly working against him and planning to sell the animals to a testing laboratory! So the appliances have another problem on their hands when they find out about this scheme and now must also try to save their animal friends! One reason why this Brave Little Toaster sequel is inferior to its predecessor is the plot which isn't quite as interesting or adventurous as that of the original. The appliances stay in the same place for most of this film and don't go on the kind of epic journey they did before. The film also doesn't quite have the eerie feel to it that's part of what makes its predecessor so good. Some new characters are introduced here such as the animals the appliances share a room with and the master's evil lab assistant Mack. There's at least one new character I didn't care much for and that was Ratso around the beginning though I think he improves after that. I didn't find the songs in this sequel to be all that memorable though I've only heard them once. I can't forget to mention the humour. I did laugh at times but definitely not as much as I did when I last watched the original. For example the Radio isn't as funny here. I guess he's not the same without Jon Lovitz providing his voice though he still has his moments. Despite the flaws this movie does have amusing gags plus a bit of suspense and some mildly poignant moments though none of it is consistent enough to make for a really good family film.The Brave Little Toaster was released by Disney but produced by Hyperion Pictures so it isn't really a Disney flick. However just like a number of theatrical animated Disney movies it got the directtovideo sequel treatment. I haven't seen all of Disney's directtovideo sequels but the ones I have seen have lead me to believe that most of them aren't really that good and tend to show a significant drop in quality from their theatrical predecessors. Basically that's also the case with this sequel to the barely theatrical 1987 Hyperion Pictures production. Some parts of this one are pretty good and I found that it improves along the way leading to a satisfying ending but there's definitely something missing from the original. If you're a fan of the underrated 1987 movie you might like to see The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue but I guess there's a good chance you won't like it at all and if that's not the case you could easily end up thinking of it as a mixed blessing like I do.".

So the appliances have another problem on their hands when they find out about this scheme and now must also try to save their animal friends! One reason why this Brave Little Toaster sequel is inferior to its predecessor is the plot which isn't quite as interesting or adventurous as that of the original. The appliances stay in the same place for most of this film and don't go on the kind of epic journey they did before. The film also doesn't quite have the eerie feel to it that's part of what makes its predecessor so good. Some new characters are introduced here such as the animals the appliances share a room with and the master's evil lab assistant Mack. There's at least one new character I didn't care much for and that was Ratso around the beginning though I think he improves after that. I didn't find the songs in this sequel to be all that memorable though I've only heard them once. I can't forget to mention the humour. I did laugh at times but definitely not as much as I did when I last watched the original. For example the Radio isn't as funny here. I guess he's not the same without Jon Lovitz providing his voice though he still has his moments. Despite the flaws this movie does have amusing gags plus a bit of suspense and some mildly poignant moments though none of it is consistent enough to make for a really good family film.The Brave Little Toaster was released by Disney but produced by Hyperion Pictures so it isn't really a Disney flick. However just like a number of theatrical animated Disney movies it got the directtovideo sequel treatment. I haven't seen all of Disney's directtovideo sequels but the ones I have seen have lead me to believe that most of them aren't really that good and tend to show a significant drop in quality from their theatrical predecessors. Basically that's also the case with this sequel to the barely theatrical 1987 Hyperion Pictures production. Some parts of this one are pretty good and I found that it improves along the way leading to a satisfying ending but there's definitely something missing from the original. If you're a fan of the underrated 1987 movie you might like to see The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue but I guess there's a good chance you won't like it at all and if that's not the case you could easily end up thinking of it as a mixed blessing like I do.";

It continues from the first in the series but Lovitz as the Radio is replaced there are some annoying songs The internet was introduced along with a whole new line of strange characters including a pregnant cat a very stereotypical Hispanic chihuahua and a rat that seemingly has no purpose. The Master Rob is in college with his girlfriend and he has to write a thesis statement. Rob's girl keeps getting hit on by this pimplooking fat guy in a lab coat who tries to sell all the animals in the college to be test subjects in a medical research laboratory. The plot kind of takes a turn for the crazy when the appliances discover an enormous but outdated computing system one that needs a bulb to survive and help them rescue the animals. When the Radio accidentally breaks the bulb the other appliances yell at him so he wanders off behind a box and performs selfsurgery to remove his own bulb and slide it over to them. The toaster rather apathetically declares the radio dead this scene traumatized my sister and I when we were kids. Anyway after the new bulb is donated to the large computing system all that's left is to save the animals and stop Mr. UnmemorableNamed Pimp Guy from selling them off.For kids this film is okay save for the radio's suicide although he lives because Master and the girlfriend repair him. If you grew up with the original though you may be disappointed by this lousy sequel complete with some highly dopey songs that just don't compare with the original and some very pointless characters added in just for the hell of it. The animal rights activism gets very annoying not to get into a debate in my review but there are two sides to every story not just aw don't hurt the poor little fuzzy kitties! It's about saving lives cancer research that could save millions of humans and animals too. I'll bet P.E.T.A. is a huge fan of this movie. My favorite character of the franchise has always been the radio so it was disappointing that John Lovitz was no longer the voice actor of Radio. I thought the fat lab guy hitting on Rob's girlfriend was a little weird and out of place.If you are looking for a movie to show your kids I suggest you try the original from 1987 because not only is the radio scene disturbing but the whole concept of just what is supposedly going to happen to the animals in the lab could be extremely disturbing to kids and if you're a parent you might want to save yourself the trouble of explaining animal testing to your kid. There were several actions the characters did that appeared perverted and I think were there intentionally in the VHS tape I ordered of it the fat pimplike lab guy reaches for the girl's butt that's one example. To be honest it all depends on what you consider appropriate for your children and if you're watching it for nostalgic value as an adult you won't find it here.".

	schema:reviewBody "During much of the 1980s Disney was not performing well financially or critically. Release after release almost all of their films weren't making the cut. Whether it was based on content or something else viewers and critics alike at the time were unimpressed. That's not the case now however for many of the once unnoticed movies have found a home for those who appreciate the quality they gave. But of those there were some movies that got recognized for being well done. A couple years before Disney hit it big with The Little Mermaid 1989 another animated film came out that has made a lasting memory for many children that being The Brave Little Toaster 1987. As odd as the premise was audiences and critics were surprised to see how mature some of the basic themes and concepts were for the plot. Not surprisingly Disney went on to release a DirecttoVideo sequel of the original 10 years later. Even though it was a few years in where Disney started cranking out sequels it could've been bad but it holds up somewhat here.Picking up some time after the first events audiences rejoin the living household items once more but this time they're in the master's Rob veterinary clinic. The master is also ready to graduate and in order to do so he must submit his 600page thesis. One night while doing the finishing touches a power surge occurs causing Rob to lose all his work. Fearing he won't graduate it's up to the little toaster and friends along with some animals to save the day. Directed by Robert C. Ramirez who's better known for directing The Prince of Egypt 1998 prequel Joseph King of Dreams 2000 and written by Willard Carroll who served as executive producer to The Brave Little Toaster 1987 manage to put together an acceptable sequel considering the circumstances. It's not at the same level as the original but it's an allowable followup. What doesn't work in this sequel are a few components. The most typical of reasons being continuity errors ones that go beyond the physical realm that the first had established. Things don't just materialize.The other two problems deal with characters. The new animal additions to the original group is okay but they do feel a bit tacked on. It just feels very obligatory and one of the main animal's motive changes without reason. Then there's the role of Rob's underling named Mack who works as an assistant to him. Right when the character is introduced his personality immediately gives away what kind of character he will be. No questions. Aside from these problems there isn't much else to point out. Even with these problems dealing with development in certain characters the script still contains some material that is dark when looked at under certain lenses. With that said credit is due for at least not making the overall execution feel completely pointless. Some sequels get completely diluted and end up having no risk involved. When it comes to characters unless the viewer wanted to know who voiced them most would unknowingly discover that the majority of the original cast from the original did not return. Since the release of this was a decade later seeing why some actors who voiced childlike characters is understandable. Yet as to why Jon Lovitz Timothy E. Day Wayne Kaatz and Colette Savage did not return is beyond understanding. They did after all voice important characters. Thankfully the actors who do replace the old cast maintain the same quality performances. Jessica Tuck who voices Chris Chris Young as Rob Eric Lloyd as Blanky and Roger Kabler as Radio all sound very similar to that of the original actors and that's great. Returning from the original is Deanna Oliver as Toaster Thurl Ravenscroft as Kirby and Timothy Stack as Lampy which is great to hear as well. For new members of the cast Jay Mohr plays the voice of Mack Andy Milder voices the scruffy Ratso Alfre Woodard voices Maisie the mama cat Danny Nucci plays a Hispanic Chiwawa Andrew Daly plays Murgetroid the snake and veteran actor Eddie Bracken voices Sebastian the monkey. There's even a voice appearance from Brian DoyleMurray playing a computer.The animation is actually another decent quality to this sequel. This is mostly because The Brave Little Toaster 1987 itself did not set such a high bar. If anything the animation here is on par with its predecessor and that's okay. Taking into account that it was also animated on a smaller budget is important to recognize if the quality remains fairly the same. The film score was unfortunately not composed again by David Newman. In replace of him Alexander Janko composed the music. This was Janko's first film composition and seeing that he frequently orchestrates more than composes it's interesting that Janko made out rather sufficiently. The score itself consists of organic orchestra and uses those elements to its advantage. By this the cues that involve the darker themes work properly. The songs that the actual characters sing aren't that bad either. Tunes like Remember That Day Tap to the Super Highway and especially Chomp and Munch are fairly catchy and can get the viewer to emote. The sequel itself isn't memorable as to its predecessor but it isn't all fluff either. There are some mature themes involved the music is composed nicely and the voice cast perform well. It's just all the extra characters and an unexplained motivation that make it feel forgettable to some degree.".

Jessica Tuck who voices Chris Chris Young as Rob Eric Lloyd as Blanky and Roger Kabler as Radio all sound very similar to that of the original actors and that's great. Returning from the original is Deanna Oliver as Toaster Thurl Ravenscroft as Kirby and Timothy Stack as Lampy which is great to hear as well. For new members of the cast Jay Mohr plays the voice of Mack Andy Milder voices the scruffy Ratso Alfre Woodard voices Maisie the mama cat Danny Nucci plays a Hispanic Chiwawa Andrew Daly plays Murgetroid the snake and veteran actor Eddie Bracken voices Sebastian the monkey. There's even a voice appearance from Brian DoyleMurray playing a computer.The animation is actually another decent quality to this sequel. This is mostly because The Brave Little Toaster 1987 itself did not set such a high bar. If anything the animation here is on par with its predecessor and that's okay. Taking into account that it was also animated on a smaller budget is important to recognize if the quality remains fairly the same. The film score was unfortunately not composed again by David Newman. In replace of him Alexander Janko composed the music. This was Janko's first film composition and seeing that he frequently orchestrates more than composes it's interesting that Janko made out rather sufficiently. The score itself consists of organic orchestra and uses those elements to its advantage. By this the cues that involve the darker themes work properly. The songs that the actual characters sing aren't that bad either. Tunes like Remember That Day Tap to the Super Highway and especially Chomp and Munch are fairly catchy and can get the viewer to emote. The sequel itself isn't memorable as to its predecessor but it isn't all fluff either. There are some mature themes involved the music is composed nicely and the voice cast perform well. It's just all the extra characters and an unexplained motivation that make it feel forgettable to some degree.";

	schema:reviewBody "According to Marc Scott Zicree's Twilight Zone Companion screenwriter Charles Beaumont wrote the screenplay of this film as a spoof problem was according to Beaumonttoo many people who worked on the film didn't seem to realize it. Perhaps Zsa Zsa Gabor who played her role in it as straight drama as noted in another comment is an example of this.The scene near the beginning in which the girlfriend of one of the astronauts watches his rocket take off after a passionate goodbye clinch with her man wearing deep red lipstick and a bright green dress which billows dramatically around her from the wind of the takeoff is reminiscent of the famous and iconic scene of Marilyn Monroe with her skirt billowing up around her while standing on the subway grating in The Seven Year Itch. The surface of Venus seen spinning at and rushing up to the rocket right before it crashes is really a photograph of the moon taken from one of the larger Earthbased telescopes  one at Lick Observatory perhaps ?  The beta disintegrator the Queen intends to use to destroy the Earth reminds me of a giant kid's beanie with a propeller on top. The image of Earth as seen from Venus that appears in the weapon's view screen is of fair quality and may even include some cloud cover.

In the case of World Without End it made my dad ask me if I'd been fooling with the knobs on the back of the set when I watched it on TV. Cue the Outer Limits control voice There is nothing wrong with your television set ...The big fight near the end which seems to consist of almost the entire cast shoving each other about in an annoyed girlish way is what Stephen King referred to in his novel Christine as a pushy pushy  an expression of annoyance without any serious intent or attempt to inflict harm.The friend who mentioned this to me once saw Queen on a double bill with the original Attack Of The Fifty Foot Woman in a NYC revival cinema. She remarked that the audience was almost as much fun as the film as it consisted mostly of gay male couples doing Zsa Zsa Gabor impersonations all over each other !".

	onyx:emotionText "According to Marc Scott Zicree's Twilight Zone Companion screenwriter Charles Beaumont wrote the screenplay of this film as a spoof problem was according to Beaumonttoo many people who worked on the film didn't seem to realize it. Perhaps Zsa Zsa Gabor who played her role in it as straight drama as noted in another comment is an example of this.The scene near the beginning in which the girlfriend of one of the astronauts watches his rocket take off after a passionate goodbye clinch with her man wearing deep red lipstick and a bright green dress which billows dramatically around her from the wind of the takeoff is reminiscent of the famous and iconic scene of Marilyn Monroe with her skirt billowing up around her while standing on the subway grating in The Seven Year Itch. The surface of Venus seen spinning at and rushing up to the rocket right before it crashes is really a photograph of the moon taken from one of the larger Earthbased telescopes  one at Lick Observatory perhaps ?  The beta disintegrator the Queen intends to use to destroy the Earth reminds me of a giant kid's beanie with a propeller on top. The image of Earth as seen from Venus that appears in the weapon's view screen is of fair quality and may even include some cloud cover.

Suitably stung the men were banished to a nearby satellite meanwhile the queen wears a stupid mask and the women evidently pass their time doing their hair. In each coif there's never a strand out of place and somewhere on Venus somebody's doing a roaring trade on fireengine red lipstick.Things get sticky when a whole lot of Earth astronauts land on Venus bringing with them the sets and props for Forbidden Planet.

The women are at first hostile but the natural order is restored when Zsa Zsa takes the helm and long before the fadeout all is goo eyes and closed mouth kissing.

People who claim that Marilyn Monroe was never given a chance to extend her dramatic range might consider taking up Zsa Zsa's cause as well.

The spaceship is from Flight to Mars' from a design originally submitted but rejected for the Destination Moon' rocket.

For me the film is funny because it is trying to be funny in some parts but also very funny because it is crudely cheaply and horrificly made in many instances.  Obviously casting Zsa Zsa Gabor in the lead role answers the question that this was intended to be a parody.  Come on she is not an actress but rather a fixture albeit a charming vivacious buxom one.  Three astronauts and a professor are on their way to a space station when some laser beams destroy the station before their very eyes and lead them to the planet of Venus millions and millions of miles away.  All our scientific knowledge of Venus is wildly inaccurate as the gravity is much like that of Earth's and oxygen is prevalent.  The men are taken at night by surprise by a band of armed miniskirt clad Venusians that bring them before the maskfaced evil queen.  From there a Venusian scientist played by Miss. Gabor no less offers help to the men to escape.  The rest is about the foiled escape and the eventual unmasking of the evil queen and her desire to obliterate Earth.  The film has so much sexual innuendo and badtryingtobefunny smug acting as to be a little annoying. The male leads are not very good.  Eric Fleming as the man wanted by both Zsa Zsa and the queen is adequate.  Paul Birch typically a pretty good actor does a shameless job in this film smiling constantly and his scene where the space station is destroyed and he is suppose to look disconcerted is a real hoot!  Maybe this is what they were trying to do.  The other two guys are very annoying with one stupid joke after another.  One is a lothariotype making degrading comments about the fairer sex repeatedly. Even I tired of them after awhile.  The women...well they are heavenly. All of them are beautiful and Zsa Zsa is near the top of that heavenly spectrum.  Beautiful Joi Lansing also has a bit part in the beginning. Journeyman director Edward Bernds directs with some style.  I particularly like how he used color in the film.  Visually the film has lots of bright blues and reds that really takes much of your attention away from the bad acting and plot.".

It's so ridiculously sexist and outdated that you can't possibly take it seriously unless you have a stick up your rear the size of a redwood. Also it's a '50s scifi movie so it has that charm about it. I love the colorful costumes sets and props. The cast is good. Zsa Zsa is memorably bad in the best way. Eric Fleming and Paul Birch play it straight which helps make the whole thing that much funnier. Dave Willock is always a treat. But it's Patrick Waltz that gets the best and most sexist lines. A fun scifi movie that everyone should be able to enjoy on some level. Just take your serious hat off for awhile.".

One of the oddest things about this film besides Zsa Zsa Gabor's VenusianHungarian accent is that the costumes and minor props like rayguns all came from Forbidden Planet. Yup If you liked Ann Francis' ensemble as Altaira in FP here's your chance to see it again modified for Ms. Gabor's somewhat more ample contours. But don't let these borrowed items from the greatest science fiction film of the 50's get your hopes up I've seen better use of cardboard in a highschool production of She Stoops To Conquer. Everything about this movie is delightfully awful.

A space ship carrying four American astronauts is struck by a mysterious ray and forced down on Venuswhich is ruled by evil Queen Yllana Laurie Mitchell who has banished men from the planet and who now determines to kill our heroes and blow up the earth for good measure. Fortunately the astronauts are befriended by Talleah Zsa Zsa Gabor scientist and rebellion leader. Along the way we encounter lots of leggy busty women in short chiffon skirts silly special effects that include a large rubber spider and a doomsday machine that looks like it has been slapped together from cardboard and spray paint.The script was written by Charles Beaumont a writer of no particular talent and alternates great stretches of flat dialogue with accidentally funny oneliners most memorably Zsa Zsa Gabor's I HATE zat Queen! The film was directed by Edward Bernds prolific creator of grade C movies during the 1940s and 1950s and in general consists of people standing around looking like they wished they had something to do. As for the cast...The big noise here is of course Zsa Zsa Gabor one of three Hungarian sisters who became celebrities during postwar era. Sister Eva was an amusing actress sister Magda had a talent for finance Zsa Zsa however was simply famous for being famous and was a frequent guest star on television programs of the day working her accent her jewels and her numerous marriages for all they were worth to create a cult of celebrity that effectively kept her in the public eye for more than fifty years. She is indeed beautiful. She cannot however act and her entire performance consists of looking dreamy in a series of floaty gowns.The rest of the cast is very much B movie. Laurie Mitchell had a long career playing small parts in lowbudget movies and supporting roles in such television series as BONANZA much the same can be said for actors Eric Flemming Paul Birch and Patrick Waltz. Zsa Zsa Gabor aside the most recognizable performer is Dave Willock who appeared in close to two hundred films and television programs between 1939 and 1972 most often in small but charming character roles.So bad it's good movies really are a matter of personal taste one person's hilarity is another's boredom. I myself felt that the film got off to a memorable startbut about midway through I found the amusement factor began to pale. It is very easy on the eyes but it just goes on about twenty minutes too long. The DVD somewhat surprisingly offers the film in very good shapeand it comes with a commentary that features actress Laurie Mitchell who recalls the experience with fondness. Recommended for cultmoviefans but primarily for those who want to know what all the fuss over Zsa Zsa Gabor was about.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

On the one hand you've got an incredible amount of camp appeal. The movie is a mix of Zsa Zsa as a scientist who can't stand still without posing some inspired set design vivid colors leggy Venusian women in short skirts and highheels wacky dialogue delivered with a completely straight face arcane sexist jokes and some of the best unintentional at least I think it was unintentional humor you can find. It's so completely off the wall and deliciously silly that I cannot help but like it. But where there's one hand you usually find the other. The movie has its share of problems that I cannot overlook. Chief among them is some very uneven pacing and a plot that has a tendency to drag. Add to that some less that stellar acting from some of cast and what seems to be disinterest on the part of others I can't rate Queen of Outer Space as high as I would like. In the end I've taken the easy way out once again. I've split the difference and given the movie a 510  while it may be a camp lover's dream there are problems that kept me from fully enjoying the Queen of Outer Space.".

The movie is a mix of Zsa Zsa as a scientist who can't stand still without posing some inspired set design vivid colors leggy Venusian women in short skirts and highheels wacky dialogue delivered with a completely straight face arcane sexist jokes and some of the best unintentional at least I think it was unintentional humor you can find. It's so completely off the wall and deliciously silly that I cannot help but like it. But where there's one hand you usually find the other. The movie has its share of problems that I cannot overlook. Chief among them is some very uneven pacing and a plot that has a tendency to drag. Add to that some less that stellar acting from some of cast and what seems to be disinterest on the part of others I can't rate Queen of Outer Space as high as I would like. In the end I've taken the easy way out once again. I've split the difference and given the movie a 510  while it may be a camp lover's dream there are problems that kept me from fully enjoying the Queen of Outer Space.";

Oh and I forgot they inadvertently dispose of this Queen figurehead along the way.So many cliches are evident the jerky spaceship grating annoying sound effects the Queen being wicked as she is disfigured a subHarryhausen insect monster that is there for about five seconds! the ray guns the pseudototalitarian with monarchist trappings oppressive state with an already active resistance the rebels being whiter than white and a few explosions and bangs near the end.

A truly LOL moment  I must remark now that I remember it why isn't the professor accorded a girl in that middle part when the rest of them are lounging around?  Though I suppose they do end with a token gesture of his maniacal absurdly grinning smug face being seen to by The Girls as they are referred to in the end credit.To conclude may I say it is tough to rate such a film on film making quality it has to be a 2 out of 10 but on entertainment value an 8 so I'll give it a five. It is worth watching as it is fairly short  around seventyfive minutes  and just to see either those largely delectable miniskirted dames orand laugh at an unbelievably ridiculous film in all its garish glory.Rating  12".

Sandra Bullock was decent in scenes with her family but there was no chemistry between her  Harry Connick Jr.It would have been helpful to have a few brief scenes showing life between Birdie Sandra Bullock and her husband and best friend even if only still lifes showing the progression from High School to now.....it would have made the bond between them more apparent and helped us to sympathise with her loss.  As it was both husband and best friend were simply paper doll characters labeled The Bad Guys and the audience is left wondering why they were there to begin with.The constant interruption of boom mikes  in the bathroom over the stairs in the bedroom with the daughter  was extremely annoying and distracted from an already weak film.This film is not a winner.

Sandra Bullock was decent in scenes with her family but there was no chemistry between her  Harry Connick Jr.It would have been helpful to have a few brief scenes showing life between Birdie Sandra Bullock and her husband and best friend even if only still lifes showing the progression from High School to now.....it would have made the bond between them more apparent and helped us to sympathise with her loss.  As it was both husband and best friend were simply paper doll characters labeled The Bad Guys and the audience is left wondering why they were there to begin with.The constant interruption of boom mikes  in the bathroom over the stairs in the bedroom with the daughter  was extremely annoying and distracted from an already weak film.This film is not a winner.  Thank you  please try again.";

Sandra Bullock is very good in a complex role. Gena Rowlands is gold. Harry Connick Jr. fails to impress. Michael Par is awful. Mae Whitman is extremely irritating but the other child actor Cameron Finley is quite likable. Some of the scenes are beautifully shot like the ones where Sandra Bullock is taking photographs. I know the director and writer had good intentions with the film. There isn't much happening but even as a mood piece it doesn't quite work like 'The Station Agent' does.

	schema:reviewBody "Village of the Giants based very loosely on H.G. Wells Food of the Gods is one of those classic cult films that gets worse and more enjoyable on repeated viewings. Later on Bert Gordon actually did make a straight version of the science fiction classic that was quite a bit better. But I'm sure a pile of money was made on this one at many driveins across the country.Sad to say that films like these are what happens to a lot of teen idols. Of the cast in this film only Beau Bridges and Ron Howard went on to careers of real substance. I'm willing to bet that both look back on this film and cringe.I think what Walt Disney did to Tommy Kirk was a disgrace but typical of Hollywood in the preStonewall days. Tommy might have had a substantial career had the gay 'scandal' never happened who knows. Or this might have been where he would have wound up any way maybe later on. There are too many variables to consider. I would point out that Johnny Crawford didn't fare any better than Tommy in his post Rifleman career and he had no scandal attached to him at this point.What this is about is six out of town teenagers drunk and stupid wind up in a small town where they take some 'goo' that child scientist Ronny Howard invents and grow to be some 15 to 20 feet tall. Led by Beau Bridges they start running things until the town kids headed by Tommy Kirk and Johnny Crawford fight back and Ron Howard finds an antidote. Best shot of the film Johnny Crawford hanging on for dear life to giant Joy Harmon's cleavage. Must have sent them rolling in the aisles back in the day.".

Beau Bridges leads a bunch of bad teens Tommy Kirk of Disney comedy fame is the leader of some good teens and you are the befuddled audience trying to believe what is transpiring on the screen.Natch the idiotic bad teens get a hold of the goo and turn into colossal idiotic bad teens who take over a small town somewhere. Apparently the presence of 30 foot hostile giants does not interest anyone outside of the town so the townsfolk are left to fend for themselves. Of course nobody in the town except the good teens bother to do anything about it.Once the giants appear the action is limited probably due to a lack of budget for special effects. The growth sequence is about all they really focused on where they oh never mind. It's the highlight of the film though trust me. Progressively cheaper and cheaper effects parade their way through the story after that. My favorite is the scene where they try to tie up a giant Beau Bridges. You see two plastic poles supposed to be his legs being roped by the good teens. They then try to fasten the ropes with hot rods orbiting the surprised victim. Every once in a while they show Beau making spasmodic and confused expressions in slow motion. By the way whenever they show a character in slowmo you know it's one of the giants.The movie knows it's idiotic and makes no effort to conceal it. Good for a laugh at how absurd it is.".

It's all rather silly and quite funny if you're up for this kind of movie.  Of course it's not funny in the way Gordon intended.  Was it ever?Tommy Kirk also of the classic Mars Needs Women is fooling around with his lady friend in the start of the film when Ronny Howard Still with a full head o' hair and answering to the modest name Genius creates a formula that makes things grow.  When the nogood drifter teens get their hands on it they cause some real trouble and it's up to Tommy and Ronny to stop the chaosy.  The best scene is the first in which the teens appear before the town.  They show up at an outdoor barbecue and everyone is afraid but really not so afraid that they run away or anything they just kind of look up and gasp a lot.  So then the giants are making threats and Tommy in a fit of rage and large hair picks up a chair That just happened to be sitting around outside in a park and breaks it over the giants legs They pretend use your imagination.  He goes Ow! and then backfists Tommy who gets whalloped.  Very nicely done.The whole film takes place in a vacuum.  No one seems to be much surprised or worried by the giants ducks that show up out of nowhere in the Whiskey A GoGo and start dancing.  They just kind of go along with it.  Nor is anyone interested in calling the government in when the teens take over the town. They just sort of go with it.  And really when these giants move as slow as they do why would anyone be afraid of them?  You can always outrun them or if they try something take two steps to the left.  Bert I. Gordon if you'll pardon the expression just wasn't thinking big enough in this movie to really deal with the consequences of his ideas.  The end is so banal and rather anticlimactic especially for what is essentially a monster movie.All in all Village of the Giants is low on logic but high on some good laughs most at its expense.".

'Village of the Giants' seems to be a B movie that was intended to attract young kids and the teen audience of the early 1960s. What you will find here is a poorly directed low budget movie with bad acting cheap special effects and a plot that goes no where. You'll see a lot of bikini clad teenagers go go dancing to some mild early rock and roll music played by the Beau Brummels. The camera does show a lot of cleavage shots and wiggling butts that surely was and is one of the movies main attractions. This movie was most likely considered a little racy for it's day. Quite a bit of this movie brings up the anti authority good teen versus bad teen issue. This is all very mild by today's standards. Actually this makes it humorous in today's world and it can be mildly entertaining if not taken too seriously. It is nice to see Ron Howard as a child actor in this movie playing the part of 'Genius'. You'll also find a couple of ex Mickey Mouse Club members in the cast. 'Village of the Giants' could be considered one of those 'it's so bad it's good' movies. You have to view this as a fun but stupid movie and by no means look at it with a critical eye.

	schema:headline " Tommy Kirk in another nonDisney Disney movie  adjust your expectations accordingly";
	schema:reviewBody "As mentioned in the summary line Village Of The Giants has many of the elements of the live action Disney comedies of the early 60's mildly bemused humor with a 'way out' attitude safely toned down for the kiddies The Barefoot Executive teen gang dynamics romance and dancing The Monkey's Uncle a magical chemical substance that breaks the laws of physics via cheesy process shots Flubber a juvenile genius The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes and even Tommy Kirk exMousketeer and juvenile lead from many of the old Disney movies by then in exile from The Magic Kingdom. My guess is that Bert I. Gordon who tried his hand at many different genres including fantasy horror and film noirall badly decided to make a Disney film  only slightly hipper music by the Beau Brummels blonds in bikinis drug jokes etc racier by 60's standards and campier.Village is intentionally camp and cheesy all right. And it's even vaguely funny. Not haha funny but pothead funny  if you were stoned or drunk you might get a mild chuckle out of the proceedings.In its favor Giants features some pretty nice eye candy in the form of the blond girl members of the 'bad' teen gang that comes to town to make trouble for our wholesome law abiding teen gang. This is speaking as a male of course. They're pretty hot if you like the Pam Anderson platinum blond gogo dancer type. They also dance real good. And the Beau Brummels contribute a couple of nice lively pop songs that are much rawer and funkier than anything you would hear in a Disney film from that time.Against practically everything else. Beau Bridges eventually matured into a fine actor but the movie tries to peddle him as a cool guy and a teen idol which is ridiculous given his molelike opaque features constipated expression and pale flabby body. He has great hair and complexion and that's it. Poor Tommy Kirk tries his best to carry the film as the teen 'hero' of the town but at this point in his career it was basically over for him. As a result he tries too way hard and the movie makes him such a goody two shoes that you can't help but cheer when giant Beau backhands him for a loop. The special effects range from barely acceptable a couple nice shots of the giant kids gathered on a theater stage to ludicrously bad the giant mannequin legs that Tommy breaks a chair against. The screenplay is completely brain dead even as it tries to veer from heavy handed irony to action to comedy managing to be none of those things...not even good camp. I don't want to pick on the supporting cast though because the screenplay called for cardboard cutouts to go through the motions and allows none of the 'minor' members of the cast any room for something as evocative as actual 'acting'. BTW what was the deal with the red headed gogo dancer? Was it supposed to be sexy when she vibrates all over like a blender set on 'puree'? Was she supposed to be shaking her 'bippy'? It wasn't a gogo dance it was a muscle control exhibition...! Wait stop take a breath. Whoofa whoofa whoofa. OMMMMMmmmmmm...OK the movie is basically harmless. It's just really stupid so stupid as to nullify even the 'camp' entertainment value. MST3K covered it in one of their later 'SciFi' channel episodes which is pretty funny. Go watch that one if you can or don't. You won't be missing much.".

	onyx:emotionText "As mentioned in the summary line Village Of The Giants has many of the elements of the live action Disney comedies of the early 60's mildly bemused humor with a 'way out' attitude safely toned down for the kiddies The Barefoot Executive teen gang dynamics romance and dancing The Monkey's Uncle a magical chemical substance that breaks the laws of physics via cheesy process shots Flubber a juvenile genius The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes and even Tommy Kirk exMousketeer and juvenile lead from many of the old Disney movies by then in exile from The Magic Kingdom. My guess is that Bert I. Gordon who tried his hand at many different genres including fantasy horror and film noirall badly decided to make a Disney film  only slightly hipper music by the Beau Brummels blonds in bikinis drug jokes etc racier by 60's standards and campier.Village is intentionally camp and cheesy all right. And it's even vaguely funny. Not haha funny but pothead funny  if you were stoned or drunk you might get a mild chuckle out of the proceedings.In its favor Giants features some pretty nice eye candy in the form of the blond girl members of the 'bad' teen gang that comes to town to make trouble for our wholesome law abiding teen gang. This is speaking as a male of course. They're pretty hot if you like the Pam Anderson platinum blond gogo dancer type. They also dance real good. And the Beau Brummels contribute a couple of nice lively pop songs that are much rawer and funkier than anything you would hear in a Disney film from that time.Against practically everything else. Beau Bridges eventually matured into a fine actor but the movie tries to peddle him as a cool guy and a teen idol which is ridiculous given his molelike opaque features constipated expression and pale flabby body. He has great hair and complexion and that's it. Poor Tommy Kirk tries his best to carry the film as the teen 'hero' of the town but at this point in his career it was basically over for him. As a result he tries too way hard and the movie makes him such a goody two shoes that you can't help but cheer when giant Beau backhands him for a loop. The special effects range from barely acceptable a couple nice shots of the giant kids gathered on a theater stage to ludicrously bad the giant mannequin legs that Tommy breaks a chair against. The screenplay is completely brain dead even as it tries to veer from heavy handed irony to action to comedy managing to be none of those things...not even good camp. I don't want to pick on the supporting cast though because the screenplay called for cardboard cutouts to go through the motions and allows none of the 'minor' members of the cast any room for something as evocative as actual 'acting'. BTW what was the deal with the red headed gogo dancer? Was it supposed to be sexy when she vibrates all over like a blender set on 'puree'? Was she supposed to be shaking her 'bippy'?

The writing and effects do leave a lot to be desired but this was actually a fun movie to watch if you don't try and take it too seriously.   Lots of laughs at some of the gags and moments that this movie takes. And the music.. oh brother. ha ha.While some of the giant animals like the dog cat and ducks look really bad and you can tell that its like a split screen zoom up close effect thing they are going for  those type of scenes and moments could have really worked using todays technology.   The ideas for this movie were there and with a good script I really believe this would have been one of the best fantasysci ficomedy spoof type movies made.  Potentially But unfortunately what we do get is giant cats that exit through the door never to be seen again giant dogs that can't enter the room at all giant wooden legs in the middle of a road as cheap built motorcycles circle around.  And Ron Howard in a role I'm sure he would rather soon forget he did.The plot itself was silly.  4 trouble making teens enter a town only to steal some growth formula invented by before mentioned Ron Howards character.  Lots of giant kids run loose and tell everyone they are in charge now. But all they seem to do is sit around a lot in a huge auditorium and eat.  Lots of sexual innuendo including a breast ride on one of the giant female teens as she tries to dance with someone and bad jokes like midgits at the end showing up hoping for some of the formula.Funny movie but if it was written well and even remade to todays effects could be a great movie all together.2 12 stars in my book.  Has a lot of potential and you have to take into effect when it was made.".

If I had this stuff and knew full well what it did I think I'd be secretly dropping in the food of my favorite chicks just for the reaction factor of course I know I'd pay dearly later. Except for Joy Harmon and Toni Basil none of these actresses are really all that attractive to tell the truth and the guys seem to be nothing more than stereotypes the hero the sidekick the tough the bully none of the personalities are developed. In this movie Beau Bridges and his entourage of friends I can't really call them a gang come to town and eventually discover that Ron Howard Opie himself from The Andy Griffith Show has accidentally created by chance a formula for giants. What does he do with it  he dares his friends to eat it and they do! Right nowyou know these kids are a few fries short of a happy meal. They take over the town just to rebel against the adults when you know they'd be fairly lousy parents themselves only to lose face and common sense in the end. The parents don't do anything so their kids have to get together and do something. The movie occurs in a vacuum with no trace of the outside world. The Paramount lot with the house from Bewitched and The Partridge Family is used in one attack scene and the courthouse lot at Universal from Back to the Future and Bruce Almighty appears at the end. The plot shifts between comedy and camp and special effects are okay and a bit dated but not outstanding yet overall this movie has become its own cult movie in a way and has become a starvehicle for fans of the busty and lovely Joy Harmon. Only Bridges and Howard are still working today. Even I enjoy this movie as a moviefantasy about giants but on its own merits it is just plain boring. I give it 5 out of 10 stars. Nevertheless I wouldn't mind seeing this movie remade today with Christina Ricci Melissa Joan Hart Britney Spears and Sara Michelle Gellar as the giantesses.".

So I went to the theater to play movie roulette. Hot Tub Time Machine was playing almost immediately and the next movie after that wouldn't be for another 45 minutes. I almost turned around and went home so sure was I that this film was going to be stupid rather than funny. But I figured what the heck I'm here...Well the movie is stupid. But it's funny too. And what's more it knows it's stupid and makes no bones about it. At no time does it ever take itself seriously. Now I could have done without some of the extremely gross bits. Happily there aren't too many of them. And I'm sure I didn't get all the 80's references although I did live through the period I largely avoided popular culture at that time and still couldn't tell you most of the bands or big hit songs of the time or of today for that matter.But I have to confess the movie did make me laugh. Not all throughout but I did have a number of genuine laughoutloud moments. And plenty of chuckles and smiles. And I found myself genuinely liking the characters and finding them to have a bit more depth than I expected from a film entitled Hot Tub Time Machine. And the basic theme of the loss of the zany freeform fun of youth and regret of the relative staid blandness of adult life is a theme which resonated with me.Now let's get real. This is no Citizen Cane Vertigo or The Godfather. Nor is a timeless comedy masterpiece like Airplane Blazing Saddles or Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Someone here displayed gross unfairness in trying to compare it to a classic '30's comedy but obviously this is not It Happened One Night Bringing Up Baby or Duck Soup and if you go to the theater expecting it to be the fault lies with you. What it is is a silly fun enjoyable way to pass a couple hours. Not deep not profound not brilliant. Not timeless not enduring.But not bad. And not nearly as stupid as it looked like it was going to be. And these days that's not too bad.".

And I found myself genuinely liking the characters and finding them to have a bit more depth than I expected from a film entitled Hot Tub Time Machine. And the basic theme of the loss of the zany freeform fun of youth and regret of the relative staid blandness of adult life is a theme which resonated with me.Now let's get real. This is no Citizen Cane Vertigo or The Godfather. Nor is a timeless comedy masterpiece like Airplane Blazing Saddles or Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Someone here displayed gross unfairness in trying to compare it to a classic '30's comedy but obviously this is not It Happened One Night Bringing Up Baby or Duck Soup and if you go to the theater expecting it to be the fault lies with you. What it is is a silly fun enjoyable way to pass a couple hours. Not deep not profound not brilliant. Not timeless not enduring.But not bad. And not nearly as stupid as it looked like it was going to be. And these days that's not too bad.";

There are some classic lines mostly coming from insults and the film doesn't rely too much on date humour just a few references to email etc. It cleverly spits in the face of the butterfly effect and relishes its characters manipulation of time whilst showing that some things can't be avoided.

	schema:reviewBody "First off let me say that I did rather enjoy this film.Yes it is a rather read VERY farfetched premise. And yes it does have some massive plot holes mainly because it completely disregards the spacetime continuum. But this film is not designed to have you focus on these things. It is only after viewing that you realise just how stupid the whole thing is and where all the problems with timelines etc etc lie. Yet I still found myself wanting to see it again.The main characters play their parts very well. All the actors must have known exactly what they were getting themselves into and they are all willing participants. I did especially enjoy Rob Corddry's part as a washed up dead end dead beat alcoholic. His character was the fulcrum for the majority of the humour both situational and verbal. Craig Robinson bought the lighthearted humour as well as some of the best punch lines of the film. John Cusack played the 'serious' dramaticcomedic role and Clark Duke has his moments while helping to aim the whole package toward a younger demographic. Even the secondary characters have their moments of comedy glory.There are genuine laugh out loud moments spread pretty evenly throughout which are based on plot and character not just grossout humour. And although grossout humour is present it sits well because the film doesn't rely on it alone to deliver the laughs.Another thing I found very entertaining about this movie was that as the characters travelled back to the 80's it was almost as if the humour did too. I don't mean to say that things descended into a 'Porkie's Revisited' or anything like that but there were definite elements of the 80's present in the way the humour and characters come across. Think back to scenes you remember off the top of your head from Back To The Future Caddy Shack Ferris Bueller's Day Off hell  even Breakfast Club. Hot Tub Time Machine just seemed to capture some of that and revive it for today's audiences.I would recommend HTTM to anyone with a sense of humour not wanting to think too deeply and wanting to be entertained for 90 minutes.Like I said at the top of this review... There are plot holes. There is no recognition of the spacetime continuum  actually the future repercussions of the character's actions would have never worked out like they do. And really at no point does the film actually make sense.BUT... I was still entertained. I still laughed. I still wanted to see where the characters went. I still find myself remembering lines from the film and smiling. And even after all I've just written I'd still watch it again.Can't say more than that now can I?".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard about this movie I didn't think it was something I would pay to see in the theater. It just looked took much like a frat pack flick for my personal taste. However I had a chance to see a free sneak preview of it and was more than pleasantly surprised.Hot Tub Time Machine is the story of three longtime friends  Adam John Cusack Lou Rob Corddry and Nick Craig Robinson  and Adam's 20something nephew Jacob Clark Duke who revisit the ski resort playland of the three older guys' young adulthood. With the help of a hot tub outside of their room and a little movie magic the four are transported back to Winterfest '86 an event that Adam Lou and Nick attended at the resort back in the day. They believe they have to do the exact same things they did during that fateful weekend 24 years before to have a chance at getting back to 2010. Some things obviously change even when the characters are trying to keep them the same. These make for some hilarious story arcs for the three older guys and more than a few awkward moments for young Jacob.I think most adults will find this movie funny but it was made especially for GenXers and others who remember the '80s well. If you are a fan of movies such as Back to the Future one of my personal favorites Better Off Dead Red Dawn or Sixteen Candles you will get a kick out of the homage that this movie pays to those films. And it's a mustsee for John Cusack fans who produced this movie and obviously has a sense of humor about the early roles that made him a star.Granted Hot Tub Time Machine isn't perfect. There are a few obvious errors about people's ages and about the state of pop culture in the mid80s at least as I remember it. There's also some gratuitous drug use and female nudity. But these are minor criticisms about an otherwise very funny film that almost anyone between the ages of 30 and 50 is bound to appreciate.".

However I had a chance to see a free sneak preview of it and was more than pleasantly surprised.Hot Tub Time Machine is the story of three longtime friends  Adam John Cusack Lou Rob Corddry and Nick Craig Robinson  and Adam's 20something nephew Jacob Clark Duke who revisit the ski resort playland of the three older guys' young adulthood. With the help of a hot tub outside of their room and a little movie magic the four are transported back to Winterfest '86 an event that Adam Lou and Nick attended at the resort back in the day. They believe they have to do the exact same things they did during that fateful weekend 24 years before to have a chance at getting back to 2010. Some things obviously change even when the characters are trying to keep them the same. These make for some hilarious story arcs for the three older guys and more than a few awkward moments for young Jacob.I think most adults will find this movie funny but it was made especially for GenXers and others who remember the '80s well. If you are a fan of movies such as Back to the Future one of my personal favorites Better Off Dead Red Dawn or Sixteen Candles you will get a kick out of the homage that this movie pays to those films. And it's a mustsee for John Cusack fans who produced this movie and obviously has a sense of humor about the early roles that made him a star.Granted Hot Tub Time Machine isn't perfect. There are a few obvious errors about people's ages and about the state of pop culture in the mid80s at least as I remember it. There's also some gratuitous drug use and female nudity. But these are minor criticisms about an otherwise very funny film that almost anyone between the ages of 30 and 50 is bound to appreciate.";

The ridiculous title and its obvious concept turned me off at first but it turned out to be a lot of fun.As a fan of John Cusack it was pleasing to see his character Adam reminiscent of Rob from High Fidelity 2000 especially when his girlfriend moved out on him at the very beginning. She basically called me an asshole like I'm a narcissistic asshole. His friend replies Yeah she has a point though. The movie does spend a significant amount of time with the guys being assholes and calling each other assholes but it is probably the best guysactingasassholes movie.Three middleaged men are despondent with the sad state of their lives Rob Corddry being the worst of the bunch is in the hospital with another notsuicide attempt beause if he really wanted to he would kick ass at killing himself and Cusack and Craig Robinson are called in as the only people who could be described as his friends. Believe it or not but the movie's opening with all this unhappiness is quite funny and real at the same time. To cheer themselves up they are off to a ski resort where they used to hang out in the 80s. I think we all know why it's called Hot Tub Time Machine.As ridiculous and inane as this all sounds there is a lot of clever humour in the movie and the characters as much as they are assholes they are also real and genuine. I know them and that just makes them all the more fun. I was annoyed with the inclusion of Jacob Clark Duke as Cusack's nephew because I think one Jonah Hill is enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "More so than with any other genre I confess to being somewhat of a comedy snob. It's not that I have particularly highbrow taste there's simply a very thin line separating what I find enjoyable and what I find intolerable. I will tell you that Hot Tub Time Machine falls squarely into the latter category and to be honest it's not even close to the line.Take a look at the title with me. I realize Hot Tub Time Machine has no delusions of grandeur. It's not about weaving a complex story it's not about great performances and it's not about smart direction. It exists for the sole purpose of making me laughand that's its crippling failure. The film is so absolutely flimsy that when a joke misses the mark everything collapses. You're not looking at a beautiful image you're not engrossed in the story and if you're not even laughing then there's truly nothing to behold.Personally I'm more inclined to laugh at situations and characters I understand and am invested in. While Mike Judge's Extract wasn't a great film the director and his cast created threedimensional performances and I was content to watch them work even when they weren't making me LOL. Hot Tub on the other hand defines its characters with a single clich narcissist asshole married guy weirdo Jeez that sounds familiarand spends all of fifteen minutes in introduction before chucking them into a car together and asking the audience to take for granted that they were once best friends. Their performances are bereft of this assumed comraderie and they spend most of the body of the film with one or fewer of their three supposed amigos.Here's the thing. Character is the foundation of even adequate cinema and not only does Hot Tub forgo the character anglewhich would be fine if the comedy compensatedbut the inane dialogue they let dribble from their mouths blends tired lazy college humor with lame eighties retrospective. To give you an idea of the intellectual level that the film and its pullstring characters operate on at one point Nick Craig Robinson suspicious that he has been transported back in time asks a stranger What color is Michael Jackson?I'll let that one simmer. Not only is the gag unfunny but it's so stupid a thing to say that hearing it is outright frustrating. The joke is for the benefit of the 21st century audience rather than the internal logic of the film and Hot Tub Time Machine is pathetic in its universal preference for cheap laughs over creative integrity. Even ideas that should be amusing either aren't or lack polish and execution. There is a somewhat successful running gag involving a future onearmed bellhop Crispin Glover presented with an escalating series of armthreatening situations in the pastthough with a completely unfulfilling pay off. That and a laundry list of other scenarios might have worked had Hot Tub had even a germ of originality.I don't mean to offend with my comedic snobbery but plainly Hot Tub Time Machine is the sort of film I can't abide. As one who's attempted to write comedy before watching the director pander successfully to the lowest common denominator while liberally pilfering from better work is an enormously frustrating experience. The screenplay is asinine and a blatant cashin on the inexplicable wave of popularity a certain film by Todd Phillips generated last year. And yet I must concede Hot Tub Time Machine is even a step removed from that. It's a pale imitation of a white turd.".

It was absolutely brilliant but you had to have been alive in the 80's to TRULY enjoy all the references that are sprinkled throughout this movie. Rob Corddry goes completely against his previous typecasting as the wimpy guy who gets bossed around by his girlfriend. He's the exact opposite in this movie and he does a wonderful job. Jon Cusack does justice to his 80's movie pedigree. The feel of this movie is very much like The Hangover. A bunch of friends who come together to raise a little mayhem over the weekend end up getting much more than what they bargained for. The comedy is superb even though it's often sophomoric in nature. If you're in the mood to laugh like a hyena and bask in the gloriousness of the 80's then look no further. I can't wait to rewatch this movie on DVD. We were all laughing so hard that I missed TONS of dialogue. There are also LOTS of 80's references and familiar faces from the era that make this movie so unbelievably fun to watch. Not to mention give it excellent replay value. Don't wait for DVD watch this movie as soon as it comes out! You'll be glad you did.".

I'm a huge fan of John Cusack High Fidelity Grosse Point Blank but he just seemed so out of place here. Kick Ass as a comedy was by far better because for one it didn't rely on a big name like John Cusack  Chevh Chase as well as a ridiculous story line to draw people into seeing this.Like one of the other reviewers said Jacob played by Clark Duke is a complete waste as he spends a majority of the film chasing Chevy Chase's character around in the film! And whats with all the vomiting in film's nowadays.. It's unrealistic and way over the top.. And finally why is Clarke's Mum Kelly OK with Lou continuing to have sex with her even despite stating that he was going to impregnate her?? I know teenagers can be stupid but I just don't buy this kind of immaturity especially on screen.The Ratings may have 7.410 now but I will not be surprised in the slightest when this drops below 6.5 in a years time..Hollywood stop wasting our time and hardearned cash with this rubbish...".

Also the eighties references weren't ridiculous they were just enough to make it work and it seems like the writers did a lot of weeding to pick only the jokes that worked. Very refreshing since there are so many idiotic comedies that think they're more funny than they are. John Cusack was good as always and the rest of the cast did an excellent job. In fact I think I could safely say that this was not a John Cusack movie but rather an ensemble movie that didn't really have a weak link.

I hoped for some recognition but that never happened. The movie maybe a little funny for young people to watch but I sincerely thought that the makers of the movie intended to make a movie for people of my age. Furthermore I hope that my kids will not get the idea that the eigthees were really that lame as the movie tries to let us believe. To keep it short watching this movie is absolutely a total waste of time!".

I went because John Cusack was in it and figured he can only sink so low. I was wrong. He can't just need the money. I guess he needed something to do but still. The characters were all just plain stupid one being totally obnoxious but not in a funny way. Just obnoxious. An insult to anyone with half a brain. The plot of course is preposterous but I knew that before I went in. It is possible to be creative even with a ridiculous plot. There was absolutely NO creativity present in this film the first half at least I just couldn't tolerate any more grossness and stupidity that just wasn't funny.

	schema:headline " Ridiculous Raunchy and Fun";
	schema:reviewBody "What a stupid title for a John Cusack movie! John Cusack doesn't steal the limelight instead everybody is given an equal chance to shine. When the opening scene had Nick putting his hands inside a dog you know that what kind of a movie this will be. The characters quickly establish themselves as 'assholes' and if you can get over the initial nauseating feeling you are in for a fun ride. I am a big fan of John Cusack and he has not let me down most of the times and he is a good bet to take. If you liked 'The Hangover' then you are going to love 'Hot Tub Time Machine'. The movie is very raunchy over the top and gross but in a good way. The chemistry between the main characters is spectacular. The music score is superb so is the acting. Authenticity and common sense is thrown out the window but just enjoy in this Hot Tub folks.In the year 2010 Adam John Cusack Nick Craig Robinson and Lou Rob Corddry are three best friends living in Los Angeles who have drifted apart from one another during the course of their lives. They all are disappointed in the way that they are living their lives now. Adam is getting dumped by yet another girlfriend Nick is in a crappy job and his wife is cheating on him while Lou is an alcoholic and hates everybody in his life. When Lou is admitted to the hospital for trying to commit suicide which he vehemently denies both Adam and Nick decide to relive their 80's in Kodiak Valley Ski Resort which were the best weekends of their lives. Jacob Clark Duke the nephew of Adam who happens to live in his uncle's basement also gets dragged along to the KValley. But KValley is not what it used to be it is now a rundown place which isn't that exciting. They go to The Great White Buffalo and are disappointed again to see the place in shambles. They get into the hot tub outside their room to relieve their stress and after a night of hardcore drinking they find themselves transported back in time to 1986. They are worried that they would bump into their old selves when they look at their reflections and see that they are their old selves. A weird old repairman tells them that they shouldn't change anything and do exactly the same thing that they did 20 years ago. Adam and Nick are in put in a quandary over this situation while Lou thinks he can make this a profitable experience. But can they get back to their lives in the present? What would I do if I was back in the 80's America? Well I would start off by inventing Google like they did and rip off today's popular music and make myself world famous. Well one can dream can't they? At least it doesn't have the moral that one shouldn't mess up their past because honestly who wouldn't take advantage knowing the things we know today? Adam and Nick are likable whereas Lou is disgusting. Fun but disgusting. Jacob is like the guy who nobody cares he is the third wheel to the party. I didn't like him that much. They all behave like teens who are drunk. Coming from a bunch of 40 year olds that was very entertaining. I loved the scene where Nick calls up his future wife and starts crying and cursing at her. She was only 9 years old and she didn't understand half the things he was saying! And the scene where Lou has to do something to Nick!! That was so fing hilarious. The women are just caricatures of the 80's where they are only thinking about drinking dancing and sex all the time and will jump into your bed if you are even remotely exciting. It also has one regular indie chick who does the usual routine stuff. The story is truly lame but the screenplay and dialogues are great which make this a pretty good watch.710".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most erroneous outcomes of a movie is when it can't decide on what its point is? In Hot Tub Time Machine the Achilles heel here is based on intentions. What is it trying to be? A feelgood tickle your funnybone comedy or a film to search for one's youth? Is it a story about forgetting your past and accepting what one has now? Or is it a nostalgic trip down Memory Lane about how your friends in the past don't connect with the friends you have today? Is it all I've aforementioned? None of it? Where the hell's the direction in this movie?The old story of traveling back in periods in time have been done a plethora of times before Back to the Future is still the best time traveling flick ever Hot Tub Time Machine offers very little in terms of originality or plot. The acting spectrum was overall impressive with John Cusack leading the pack doing a fine job of what's given to him which really doesn't say much in terms by the drab direction. In order for a person to understand the gags jokes and quips requires that you had to either have lived in the 1980's or you must have a better comprehension of 1980's culture. My childhood was in the 1980's but even some of the lingo was puzzling to me. Maybe I should have lived my teen years in the 1980's to get the jokes delivered here. There were also numerous aspects of the movie that didn't sit very well with me. For instance the lovable John Cusack getting high seems so forced and contrived. Or Craig Robinson screaming at his future wife who was 9 years old in 1986. Or if that wasn't banal how about Rob Corddry making out with Cusack's sister with Cusack not too far away and listens to every moan and grind. If you thought this was going to be a lighthearted comedy well perish the thought.This comedy is darker than a shadow during a blackout.And when all the smoke clears we the audience are left expecting the characters show a bit of sympathy for each other and that they should forget about the past and move on with their lives. Well that didn't happen either. Overall an unsatisfying outing for me in this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Prepare yourself dear reader for I am about to make a bold declaration that will either inflate or obliterate my prestigious position as a famed film critic. Here goes. John Cusack's throwback 80's flick is the best time traveling hot tub film ever created. Did I just blow your mind? Coyness aside Hot Tub Time Machine is a supremely entertaining comedy brimming with laughs and raunch all cemented with ample 80's nostalgia.Director Steve Pink is no stranger to creating successful comedies nor is he a Cusack virgin having written the screenplays for both classics Grosse Point Blank and High Fidelity. He also helmed the criminally underrated 2006 comedy Accepted and with a resume like that the fact that HTTM transcends in high concept title should really come as no surprise. There are some unnecessary visual gags and grossout humour but the strength is in the writing and how the four leads skilfully execute that script. This is the perfect drunken Friday night movie and the kind that will only grow in cultstatus as time progresses.The four aforementioned leads are as follows John Cusack as a single unhappy man Craig Robinson as a married unhappy man Rob Corddry as a divorced unhappy man and rising young rising star Clark Duke as a nerdy unhappy young man. For the exception of Duke's character that has never really lived so to speak the trio of former childhood friends have not seen their lives progress as they once dreamed. After Corddry's Lou attempts suicide they all travel to their former haven in the mountains where they encounterwhat elsea time travelling hot tub. Whipped back to that very spot in the winter of 1986 they must choose between changing what had gone wrong in their respective pasts versus facing the ramifications of altering their futures.There are ample accolades that can be given to the cast of Hot Tub Time Machine and each character brings something different to the proceedings Cusack is the wry straightman and recaptures much of the essence he possessed in the 80's movies that made him famous. Robinson who has been hilarious in essentially everything he has done gets considerable laughs and a memorable singing number. Duke as I alluded to is gaining momentum still to star in the highly buzzed ultra violent KickAss later this year. Finishing off with the main players Rob Corddry gives his best performance dropping much of his annoying mannerisms put forth in earlier films and succeeds in creating a far more endearing presence even though much of the raunch flows through him or out of him in some cases. The best running gag is tied to Crispin Glover as an armless bellhop and is executed in a way you need to see to fully appreciate.For some reason this film is drawing comparisons to The Hangover ad nauseum. Not only are the similarities limited to their rating and the target demographic but Hot Tub Time Machine is far better in most every way. One thing I will say along with last years smash if this film is merely a rung in a growing ladder of quality Rrated flicks then there will be no need for time travel we need only look to the future.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw all the good reviews on this movie I thought this was a can't miss movie. Boy was I wrong. This movie really had potential with the whole 80s theme and the reputable cast Cusack and The Office dude. The first 10 minutes got me thinking this was going to be a great comedy. I was expecting something on the order of Tommy Boy Rat Race or even Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventure. Sadly it fell fall short of all these expectations. I would even rate BioDome with Pauly Shore higher than this movie.The movie quickly fell into a repeating pattern of vulgarity. Fword this Fword that. And the drug and alcohol use was just plain ridiculous. Just about every drug seemed to have been used and was in about every scene...I can understand some drug use for reality purposes but honestly who could drink continually do cocaine hit a bong  smoke cigars all within a relatively short time period and still function? It was just so ridiculous that I honestly do not see what the point of it all was.The sexual overtone was likewise ridiculous. I mean these characters would just be sitting by themselves and some hot chick would walk up and want to take them back to their private room and do them on the spot. I mean that's cool and all if that's your thing to see unrealistic and animal like humping but it was quite farfetched and the characters had no believable chemistry. Coupling this with the other vulgar content my wife  I were just totally turned off.In general this movie had a lot of potential and I was highly disappointed. The characters left me thinking I would never want to associate with anyone like that. How can you laugh at someone doing such ridiculously stupid and potentially fatally harmful things? And how many times can you laugh at the same thing over and over and over and over again?! I thought maybe I just don't get it but everyone else in the fairly full theater was pretty quiet. There were a few regular laughers but they sounded like your typical uneducated 18 year horny guy. It's sad because there are probably a lot of kids that think this kind of behavior is funny and admirable. The plethora of good reviews really got me thinking there was some kind of conspiracy to hype this movie. If so they sure duped me.BTW I've never written a review but felt I had to do my duty to warn you. If you must see it at least save your  and wait for DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps you've heard about the greatbutneglected comedian Charley Chase and perhaps you wonder what was so great about him. If so this nicely polished gem from Chase's silent era heyday would be a good place to start an acquaintance. Judged on a bare plot outline Innocent Husbands might sound like a runofthemill marital farce the sort of tworeeler comics like Leon Errol cranked out by the dozen but the difference lies in the execution. Charley Chase was a charming agile performer with a highly expressive face and a lanky build rather like a cross between Dick Van Dyke and John Cleese. Chase also possessed a gift for physical comedy and a fertile imagination for gags which he demonstrated not only in his own movies but also when he directed films featuring his peers.When I speak of physical comedy by the way I don't mean the sort of primitive buttkicking slapstick found in the early Mack Sennett comedies. Like many of his contemporaries Charley Chase's filmmaking apprenticeship took place at the Keystone Studio during World War I but by the '20s he'd refined his skills to the point where his work was comparatively sophisticated with an occasional touch of the risqu. One example from this film when Charley is sent to an apartment building to fetch a young lady to bring to a party. He is told to stand in front of her building and whistle three times this will be her signal to throw down her room key. Charley dutifully stands before the building and whistles three times and is pelted with dozens of keys! Maybe that isn't your idea of sophisticated but it's miles ahead of a Keystone food fight. Next we have a funny scene where Charley actually has to fend off the hottotrot young lady in the back of a cab. He's not merely an innocent husband but one who has to FIGHT to uphold his virtue!This is the sort of farce in which an obsessively jealous wife tries to catch her husband cheating. He's innocent like the title says and yet he eventually winds up innocently of course with an unconscious floozy in his bedroom and must scramble to conceal her presence. Again what makes it work is the freshness Chase brings to this admittedly familiar material. A highlight comes early on when Melvin Charley's character tells his wife Mame that he's become so tired of her suspicions he's going to end it all. He stomps into the next room finds a revolver fires it into the floor and falls in a histrionic manner. No response. So naturally he does it again. Still nothing. Now Mame opens the door to watch as Melvin performs this ridiculous act a third time. Flat on the floor Melvin looks up realizes Mame is watching and quickly resumes playing dead. This may not sound so funny in the telling and God knows plenty of lesser comics have performed similar routines to little effect but trust me when Charley Chase does this it's funny. Innocent Husbands is a comic treat that deserves to be better known and so does its star performer.".

This film here is certainly one of his better works and one I'd highly recommend to those new to the comedian. This film has a pretty good set up and a wonderful cast to really bring it home. Katherine Grant is wonderful as the wife James Finlayson hilarious as a desk clerk and we've got Lucien Littlefield nearly stealing the film as a house detective.

	schema:reviewBody "Innocent Husbands is the fourth and by far the funniest Chase comedy on Alpha's Leo McCarey Directs DVD. The others are Jeffries Jr. 1924 a boxing comedy in which Charlie receives some instructions from reallife champ James J. Jeffries. But Charlie has his best scene not directly with the champ himself but with a goat who accompanies Charlie on his front knees would you believe while Charlie kneels along the ground looking for a lost tooth! The film ends abruptly but is in otherwise in very good condition. The second tworeeler on the Alpha disc is Fighting Fluid 1925 in which we find Jimmy's office full of flappers plus a jokester of a male secretary who makes Jimmy jump. Alas the movie quickly runs out of office gags and features a long sequence in which Jimmy gets drunk on liquor in the water cooler. Fortunately the second reel at the boss's house is funnier and more inventive. Third film on the Alpha disc is Bad Boy which continues the theme of Jeffries Jr. and finds Jimmy forced to toughen up in his dad's iron works. Jimmy himself would rather be a mother's boy. This film has some amusing moments but can't make up its mind where it wants to go and whose side Jimmy should take. On the other hand Innocent Husbands is genuinely funny from first to last. Unlike the previous films. it is not just a series of oneliners but one gag builds on another making an allaround hilarious comedy that builds on just the one pretext namely is Jimmy true to his wife? More characters are introduced into the plot making it more complicated and thus funnier and funnier. The support cast is great and Leo McCarey's timing and direction really brilliant.".

Unlike the previous films. it is not just a series of oneliners but one gag builds on another making an allaround hilarious comedy that builds on just the one pretext namely is Jimmy true to his wife? More characters are introduced into the plot making it more complicated and thus funnier and funnier. The support cast is great and Leo McCarey's timing and direction really brilliant.";

	schema:reviewBody "Innocent Husbands is a very funny short comedy and a good example of Charley Chase's idiosyncratic point of view as it translated to a style of comedy. It's full of physical humor but that physicality is always strongly grounded by situation  a situation which is funny in itself   and is never broad. Charley Chase is to be admired for the compactness yet completeness of his farces. Here we are familiar already with the figures of the suspicious wife and the titular innocent husband they need be introduced only in shorthand. This allows the rest of the film to become a steady and measured escalation of the concept  Charley is put in situations that will look increasingly compromising and will be increasingly difficult to explain away when his wife gets back while his actual situation as far as philandering is concerned becomes less and less enticing. The absurdity grows while the action revolves dancelike giving a kind of incongruous artfulness to the silliness of what is going on. Katherine Grant is one of the better female supporting players who was appearing in Hal Roach films at this time and she gives a good performance here given the role of Charley's stern and suspicious wife she plays it with enough seriousness to allow the humor of the events surrounding her to show through and make the scenes believable. Frequent Laurel and Hardy supporting player James Finlayson gets a funny turn without his usual false moustachio. The plot strain that has Charley's night become increasingly unpleasant  as he is dragged to a party he doesn't want to attend then is saddled against his will with an extremely unpleasant date  generates a lot of good situations and casts new light with an original twist on the familiar backbone situation of the wronglysuspected husband.".

	schema:reviewBody "The unique thing about Charley Chase was that he had the uncanny ability to take familiar material and turn it on its head. The philandering husband in one manner shape or form was a very common theme in silent comedy but here Chase puts a different spin on it and is a completely innocent husband who finds himself in increasingly compromising situations. His always suspicious wife played by Katherine Grant seeks the advice of a medium of sorts to confirm her suspicions. Meanwhile Chase has to fight off more increasingly difficult temptations and situations which may potentially sabotage his standing with his wife. The film starts out a bit slow my only criticism but then moves swiftly into delightfully complex comic scenarios. The film really takes off once the action continues inside the same hotel where his wife is seeing a medium in a nearby room. His frantic attempts to avoid being compromised contain moments that could make anyone howl with laughter. Lucien Littlefield is hilarious as an inept house detective. That's James Finlayson as the desk clerk.  of 4 stars.".

It blends medieval mythology with a modern era breathlessly. Definitely an original take on Man vs Dragon. Now to get this straight this is a film about Humans not about Dragons. The dragons merely supply the unique reason for the apocalypse. This is a film about the postapocalypse not the apocalypse. It's not about skies full of Dragons turning worldwide armed forces into ash on an epic scale. It's not about Dragons setting the world quite literally on fire. It's about after all that's happened.Which is a shame this was advertised as a film about Dragons burning all life as we know it. Of course everyone goes in expecting to see 90 minutes of Dragons destroying everything. If this had been advertised as a more human film about after these Dragons have completely wasted everything I really think this could've been seen as a good film. It unfortunately set expectations high in the wrong sort of viewers by a mindblowingly epic trailer.Christian Bale Gerard Butler and Matthew McConaughey all deliver their role superbly and the script isn't as bad as it's made out to be either. The effects were great and the Dragons do look pretty realistic to the point I almost believed this was a documentary. Okay so there are some plot holes but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to fill those in yourself. I mean does everything have to be explained so obviously? The only reason this film gets 4 stars and not 5 is because being a film about human struggle it could've done with a bit more character development. Other than that it's a deeply entertaining wellacted suspenseful film.Don't knock it before you see it for yourself.".

The dragon fx were just soso they saved the best for last sensibly.

	schema:headline " Superb visuals make this a bit more than just glorious mindless fun.";
	schema:reviewBody "Reign of Fire's' premise is simple the world has been wiped out by airborne firebreathing dragons who at first multiplied by the thousands but now themselves are starving and dying off.  A few bands of people remain here and there trying to survive.  Quinn Christian Bale with whiskers and glottal stops who was on the scene as a boy in London when the first sleeping dragon awakened in a cave unearthed by an Underground project his mum was working on leads a group of survivors in the north of England who're just trying to get a crop going for the next year and save a little mob of children.  In comes Van Zan Mathew McConaughey with shaved head and brawny tattooed arms leading an American helicopter crew. He's become a dragon slayer and since he's found there's only one male dragon left and it's somewhere around London he's come to solicit aid.  Quinn refuses.  Van Zan pushes on to London without Quinn.  They fail.  He returns and begs Quinn to come as guide.  What follows is the finale.If you probe too deeply into the premise you're not going to have any fun but fun is what this movie offers glorious mindless fun and above all fabulous apocalyptic visuals of twisted metal crepuscular landscapes dark hulking ruins and men crawling through them to fire off weapons at the evil birds which look very graceful as they sweep through the skies and spurt out long expanding streams of fire.  Shots are so stunningly composed you want them to freezeframe.  Within the dark endoftheworld light there is amazing clarity. Working with Ridley Scott's cinematographer Adrian Biddle XFiles director Rob Bowman has produced the best fantasy landscape this year next to Lord of the Rings.'  When Van Zan leads a hunt in the sky it's like a computer game and sometimes we see the game through the eyes of the dragon and it looks like a degraded digital film.  However it's not ingenuity of conception but sheer aesthetic appeal that makes the visuals of this movie so good.The other large positive factor is the very solid mostly English cast including a number of appealing youngsters led by Scott James Moutter as Jared Quinn's adopted son not to mention Bale who brings a striking level of naturalness and conviction to his role as the sensitive consciencestricken Quinn.  Bale's a foil to McConaughey's American macho militarist icon.  McConaughey whose finely chiseled face can be seen staring in mirrors in Thirteen Conversations About One Thing' is having a lark playing a brute here but in the moments when he isn't shouting he gives Van Zan almost as much conviction as Bale gives Quinn.  Ladies are in short supply in this story there's Alex Izabella Scorupco as Van Zan's helicopter pilot who winds up with Quinn and for five minutes there's Alice Krige as young Quinn's mum.  But since this movie's ideal audience might surely be young teenage boys that's probably enough. Other things are lacking too such as more variety in the dragons more recognizable details of the wrecked London of the final scenes some more colorful characters among Quinn's community as in postapocalyptic classics like Mad Max.' But to say that is to miss the point which is that this is a fast exhilarating ride that's a feast for the eyes.  If you want to view all this as a B' horror picture fine just grant that it's a firstclass version. To be seen by all means on a big screen preferably in a big oldtime movie house.".

However it's not ingenuity of conception but sheer aesthetic appeal that makes the visuals of this movie so good.The other large positive factor is the very solid mostly English cast including a number of appealing youngsters led by Scott James Moutter as Jared Quinn's adopted son not to mention Bale who brings a striking level of naturalness and conviction to his role as the sensitive consciencestricken Quinn.  Bale's a foil to McConaughey's American macho militarist icon.  McConaughey whose finely chiseled face can be seen staring in mirrors in Thirteen Conversations About One Thing' is having a lark playing a brute here but in the moments when he isn't shouting he gives Van Zan almost as much conviction as Bale gives Quinn.  Ladies are in short supply in this story there's Alex Izabella Scorupco as Van Zan's helicopter pilot who winds up with Quinn and for five minutes there's Alice Krige as young Quinn's mum.  But since this movie's ideal audience might surely be young teenage boys that's probably enough. Other things are lacking too such as more variety in the dragons more recognizable details of the wrecked London of the final scenes some more colorful characters among Quinn's community as in postapocalyptic classics like Mad Max.' But to say that is to miss the point which is that this is a fast exhilarating ride that's a feast for the eyes.  If you want to view all this as a B' horror picture fine just grant that it's a firstclass version. To be seen by all means on a big screen preferably in a big oldtime movie house.";

It amazes me that so many people are quick to put the boot in to this admittedly silly but entertaining bgrade postapocalyptic thriller yet line up to watch the absolutely awful and overblown Star Wars movies. Yes I said bgrade because despite the budget being close to 100 million that's exactly what it is a bgrade sci fi movie no more no less. Fans of Roy Ward Baker's 'Quatermass and the Pit' Larry Cohen's 'Q The Winged Serpent' and Tobe Hooper's 'Lifeforce' all of which 'Reign Of Fire' reminded me of at various points will enjoy this one more than the Blockbuster crowd. Christian Bale 'American Psycho' and Matthew McConaughey 'Frailty' are both pretty good as the leader of an underground community and a hardass military man respectively who both have different approaches to their shared problem  the ongoing threat of dragon attacks. Yes in this future dragons are real and have devastated the world and only a handful of human survivors exist. Once you can accept that premise and some of the scientific explanations for the why and wherefores of the dragons you're in for a wild ride. Noone's gonna argue this is a great movie but it's a lot of fun and I recommend it especially with beer and pizza.".

Giving a scientific edge to a creature based in fantasy this film proved to be a rather refreshing step in science fiction which means it won't be a well received one. Even if this film barely makes its money back at least it leaves the door open for other fantastic ideas in the science fiction genre. As for the film the technical side was excellent. Bowman a former television director proves he can do just as well with a 50 million dollar budget ? and a tough to sell idea. Both Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey were believable as care taking heroes. Their bipolar dynamic was especially excellent creating tension not just in beliefs but also in culture and devotion to country. McConaughey was especially good as Van Zant which was well cast considering he is an actual southerner bringing a role to his resume which I had never seen. All in all a decent film to watch. 710".

This causes the dragons to awake and spread all over the world.  They burn everything in their path.  The Earth is broiled and the dragons formed a dictatorship.  All surviving organisms hide. Quinn is the leader of a small hiding community.  His leadership comes to question when Americans show at their door.  Big grizzly Van Zan tells his story of being a dragonslayer and Quinn lets them stay.  Van Zan has a theory that there is only one male and it is living in London.  He wants an army to help him kill the male and save the world. The computer graphics and special effects are awesome.  Some movies have big dragons and little wings that somehow make it fly but Reign of Fire's dragons have huge wingspan.  The dragons look spectacular.  Van Zan's leap into the dragon is the most exciting part of the movie. I think the director is combining fantasy and future to make the audience think that anything is possible.  Bizarre things are going to happen in the future but I do not think dragons are going to take over the world.".

It's a 'postapocalypse' story where mankind is reduced to living an almost stoneage existence by a global disaster but this time the apocalypse is brought about not by nuclear weapons but a race of dragons unleashed from the depths of the earth by overambitious mining! OK it's a pretty silly concept but the whole thing is handled with panache. Director Rob XFiles Bowman is obviously at home with this kind of subject matter and the visuals are excellent thanks to cinematographer Adrian Biddel a dab hand at photographing the impossible thanks to his work on the two Mummy films and The World Is Not Enough. Critics here in the UK panned it when it came out saying that it needed more special effects but they completely missed out on the charm of the film which was in the ingenious ways that it showed the human race had been changed by the onset of the dragons. I loved the scene where Quinn and his sidekick having to entertain a castle full of children without the benefit of TV or video games enact a scene from Star Wars providing both dialogue and narration as they go.Don't listen to the critics this is definitely worth a look.".

I mean dragons in the future??However the previews didn't really say anything about the great acting touching scenes and great overall story and concept.  What a surprise this movie was!  Matthew McConnaughy does a great job and I could only really halfbelieve it was him through the whole movie!  He plays such an interesting character ... and then the highly rated Christian Bale lives up to his previous acting job... a brilliant performance on his part.I really was impressed with this movie.  It's a wonderful postapocalyptic movie that explains the demise of the dinosaurs and brings a whole new element to the evolution and recycling of life on planet Earth.  Everything in this movie was great and scifi fantasy fans you MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!A few complaints though no nothing too bad really.. just nitpicky 1 a poor directing decision on filming parts of the dragon's eyesight perspective this kind of technique is shabby but luckily it was for only 2 quick shots. 2 They should have explained how the tanks and helicopters get their fuel. 3 The end line was a little silly something to do with evolution?  Huh? 4 Where did all the female dragons go at the end?  They just seem to dissapear... maybe an extra 2 minute scene there could have helped to explain the final demise of the dragons.Overall this movie is a winner!  I'd rate it a solid 810 or so!  See it! Finally a postapocalypse movie that is original believeable and doesn't have Kevin Costner in it!!!".

This film tells a great story about the human race becoming refugees and fighting the force that dominated them.  The characters were played very well they were hard people living in hard times.  The children added perspective and even hope that humans could outlast the beasts.  The visual effects are stunning from the dragons to the wasteland the film has a dark beauty.  The plot is survival of the fittest and only one species will survive.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 2002 London.  A group of workers on a new tube tunnel unleash a dragon from it's slumber.  The end result is the destruction of much of the world and massive loss of life.  Twenty years later humans live in small communities trying to survive the best they can as they hope the dragons will eventually starve without human cities to feast on.  Quinn leads one such group until a group of US exsoldiers turn up led by Van Zan who have more of a mind to fight back.To enjoy this film you need to get over two big obstacles.  First of all the poster  it's not for this film it's for the prequel which I hope they plan to make.  The poster shows dragons over a burning London and lots of helicopters all over the place.  Basically it's a summer FX movie.  However the film itself jumps this destruction and goes straight to the future only telling us what happened through cheap footage etc.  This is a big step as it's a real downer to not be allowed to see what happens when the dragon is freed  when we had the 2020' caption I was like what the..'.  However this can be got over as the second half of the film is very good and has some good effects and good action even if it never delivers on the poster.The second obstacle is that it's silly and doesn't make sense.  Once you accept that it's full of holes then you can sit back and enjoy it more.  If you watch it and complain about plot holes then you're missing the point. For example  how come the dragons don't come and attack this fortress regularly where does all this fuel keep coming from etc etc.  But then again lets not forget that dragons aren't real either!Like I said the plot takes a while to get going.  It's hard to watch Quinn's group in a damp castle when you know you SHOULD be seeing dragons rip into the world's cities.  However when Van Zan turns up it gets a lot better and the action is good.  The actual climax is also logically very weak but is very exciting and has a real nice touch plot wise.Bale is good and is not as muscley as the Americans.  He actually turned up having not worked out because he assumed that the characters would all be malnourished.  But when he saw McConaughey he decided to bulk up a bit. McConaughey is really good as the pumped American.  He is a bit OTT but really that's what this sort of film needs.  Support is pretty bland which leaves the dragons.  Sadly the dragons themselves are pretty empty bad guys. Because we never see them destroy the world their power is never feared. In later scenes this is done better but they are never more than big monsters whereas Jurassic Park's monsters had character and threat.Overall it took time to get going and it never lives up to the marketing hype but it's still enjoyable.  Once you get past the two obstacles then you're free to enjoy the second half of the film and a really enjoyable climax.".

Once again we have the typical grayandkhaki hued postapocalyptic world filled with burnt out cities roaming bands of grimyfaced survivors and enough soot dirt and rust to make the audience feel the need for a shower once they get out of the theatre in other words the Mad Max' look.The apocalypse in this case comes in the form of a race of firebreathing dragons that are awakened from their millennialong state of dormancy thanks to a deepdrilling construction project in downtown London.  We are told that these asheating dragons hibernate for eons at a time waiting for the earth to replenish itself before embarking on another mission of total bioglobal destruction.  This is in fact the explanation for the demise of the dinosaurs though if this were indeed the case one might question just how this species managed to so completely avoid leaving any evidence of its existence in the fossil record.  In this kind of movie it is probably best not to ask questions of this sort and to just go along with the sheer inanity of it all.The first specimen to be unleashed is discovered by a young London lad named Quinn Abercrombie who 18 years later has grown up to be the hunky Christian Bale leader of a group of survivors holed up in a kind of mountainside fortress with very little hope for a future.  That is of course until one fateful day when Dragon Slayer' Denton Van Dan Matthew McConaughey makes his sootyfaced appearance.  From then on it becomes a battle of the minds and muscles between these two strongwilled individuals who have decidedly different ideas about how best to ensure the survival of the human race.Movies like Reign of Fire' pretty much preclude any real critical analysis. Suffice it to say that the special effects and art direction are quite impressive throughout the dialogue bland and purely functional and the performances adequate to the admittedly rather unchallenging task.  And the characters are at least allowed to show their human side at times displaying various amounts of fear uncertainty and emotional vulnerability even at those moments when they are having to be at their most daring and heroic.   There is one truly inspired scene in which two of the adults beguile the children by acting out the Luke SkywalkerDarth Vader I am your father' confrontation scene from The Empire Strikes Back.'  More clever moments like that would have helped make Reign of Fire' a more distinctive film than it currently is. Oh well if nothing else the theatreshaking soundtrack is enough to keep you awake if not exactly interested at all times.   But cranking up the volume is often the first indication that a movie has very little else to offer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps it's just my childish weak spot for firebreathing dragons but this movie still strikes a chord with me. Granted I'm not at all a fan of Matthew McConaughey but the movie does its job being truly exciting and gritty.I can understand some of the negative critiques and I've spotted a few things myself. Most of them had to do with the fact that the story felt like it was missing a few parts. A perfect example is when Jared and Quinn Bale had a small argument after Quinn got into a fight with Van Zan McConaughey. It felt like the conflict between the two suddenly came out of nowhere without being built up to anywhere in the story and it seemed to end without any real tension. In fact the Jared character himself didn't really seem like he actually contributed to the story so the entire scene didn't really seem necessary.Another thing that bugged me a little is that Christian Bale often spoke his lines extremely fast. It was almost as if he wanted to speed through his lines as quickly as possible. And granted there is a lot of peril so it makes sense he'd want to keep things quick but it can sometimes get a little annoying.There were still a lot of good things about the movie though. In my case I've grown so tired of seeing dragons in movies where they were just small parts of stories like ploys in a giant strategy game. This time though they were freewilled predatory animals. That idea excited me. It also excited me that they kept the actual fairytale fantasy to a minimum. In fact it didn't seem to exist at all. These weren't magical creatures. They were flesh and blood animals and the rules of real life mortality applied. And for me that makes the entire thing much more plausible save for maybe the one male dragon idea which seemed to be too close to the alien queen concept from Aliens 1986.The dragon designs were also top notch. To this day they still remain my favorite designs for any dragons I've seen anywhere in any other movie game or artwork. The idea of adapting them to a batlike design allowing them to retain four limbs was genius and much more realistic than featuring reptiles with six limbs the four legs and two wings. The fiery breath was also made very realistic with the idea of chemicals as opposed to something like the firelung mentioned in Dragonheart 2 A New Beginning 2000. And for once the dragons' wings were at a size that could justify lifting such massive animals. In short I believed these designs.Is this a perfect film? Absolutely not. The editing and screenplay sometimes seem rather sloppy and underdeveloped. But as far as dragon movies go it's unique much more realistic and extremely exciting. It's also fastpaced enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome. It's a real monster movie. It's not perfect but it's definitely worth keeping around.".

	schema:reviewBody "Q  What's the difference between a firebreathing dragon and a midsummer movie?A  One is a lumbering monster with a tiny brain that rains death and destruction and the other is just a big lizard.Reign of Fire is basically Waterworld with gasoline with all that that entails.  The story begins in London in 2008 when a tunnel crew unearths a massive underground chamber containing a dragon who like most of us is a little cranky first thing in the morning.  The dragon oddly sleeps through the breaching of its den with a massive roaring drilling machine and only wakes up when it is nudged.  All of a sudden dragons are greeting the dawn all over the world and torching things with more reckless abandon than the U.S. Forest Service.  The world is shortly destroyed as we learn in a drawnout opening sequence involving an unseen narrator writing in a journal though he doesn't seem to be writing what he's saying.  Most of the story takes place in 2020 where a society of refugees led by Quinn Christian Bale lives in a decrepit English castle hiding from the dragons.Things can only get so bad in Europe of course before the Americans show up and show up they do in an armored column of the Kentucky Irregulars led by tattooed bald nut case Denton Van Zan Matthew McConaughey.  He has a crazy idea that entails killing the boss dragon since it is the only male dragon of the millions around the globe must be a busy fella.It's critical in postapocalypse movies to establish a credible and vivid world with a balance of the modern and the primitive and a sense of how societal priorities have changed to suit the new reality.  The classic case was the juryrigged ingenuity of the Mad Max movies where V8 engines were prized and gasoline more precious than life.  They weren't necessarily realistic but they were believable because they established a set of rules and stuck by them.  Reign of Fire is all out of whack in this department the castledwellers are on the brink of starvation but seem to have a limitless supply of electricity without even a cursory explanation of where it comes from.  As part of their security net they use massive searchlights to monitor the night skies.  Uh way to keep a low profile guys.  Van Zan's people on the other hand apparently have an endless supply of fuel enough to maintain a gasguzzling tank and a helicopter! with again no hint of how.  Not to mention the fact that the world was supposedly nuked to get rid of the dragons yet the word radiation never so much as passes anyone's lips.  Plus the movie can't even keep track of its own timeline.All this could have been forgiven if we got some gutwrenching army n' dragon smackdowns.  Van Zan is supposed to be a fearsome dragon killer so you would figure that he and his militia would have some savvy antidragon tactics figured out from the painful lessons learned by the doomed struggle of the world's armies but no.  When they take on a dragon in the castle environs their plan of attack is so suicidally ludicrous it would take a minor miracle to work just once.  Without going into too much detail it involves groundbased radar monitors a hightech computer tracking system and skydivers all to try and bring the beast to earth so McConaughey can kill it with an axe.  Seriously.The movie has its good points though it is capably directed by TV veteran Rob Bowman who at least manages to imbue the ridiculous proceedings with some sort of dramatic tension.  The climactic battle is pretty impressive and there is an awesome scene of the dragon hovering over the militia while lines of tracers whip through the night sky and the smoke roils under his wings.  Wolf Kroeger's production design isn't bad the landscape is suitably scorched and desperate though it looks like they might have swiped some sets from Enemy at the Gates.  The dragons themselves of course are amazing.  They are truly mean hombres of fluid reptilian grace whose jaws leak flaming liquid as they breathe.  They almost convince you that they really could have destroyed the world that they wouldn't have been swatted from the sky in two seconds by any F18 pilot with half a brain and a rack of heatseekers.  But then you expect great effects from even the most dimwitted of movies these days.Like most monster movies Reign of Fire suffers badly when the monsters are offscreen catching a smoke break and we are left with flat characters speaking silly dialogue in a tepid story.  Bale is all right though his character comes off as something of a weenie.  McConaughey meanwhile has no chemistry with anyone or anything on screen.  He's a buffedout paramilitary psycho but not an interesting one.  You can't figure out how he became the leader maybe he was the only one who could drive a tank. The most engaging character is Alex the helicopter pilot played by Izabella Scorupco the luminous computer expert in GoldenEye who isn't given much attention by the script but who seems like she would have been a better choice to lead the militia.  Too bad she wasn't the main character.But the humans aren't the real stars anyway.  I sort of picture a dragon guzzling an Evian bottle of lighter fluid and barking into his cell phoneI'm telling you Marty I've had it!  C'mon I can fly!  I can breathe fire!  That idiot TRex gets a threepicture deal with Spielberg and what do I get?  First Dungeons  Dragons and now THIS!  Whaddaya doing to me? Get me a meeting with Katzenberg or I torch Burbank.".

The classic case was the juryrigged ingenuity of the Mad Max movies where V8 engines were prized and gasoline more precious than life.  They weren't necessarily realistic but they were believable because they established a set of rules and stuck by them.  Reign of Fire is all out of whack in this department the castledwellers are on the brink of starvation but seem to have a limitless supply of electricity without even a cursory explanation of where it comes from.  As part of their security net they use massive searchlights to monitor the night skies.  Uh way to keep a low profile guys.  Van Zan's people on the other hand apparently have an endless supply of fuel enough to maintain a gasguzzling tank and a helicopter! with again no hint of how.  Not to mention the fact that the world was supposedly nuked to get rid of the dragons yet the word radiation never so much as passes anyone's lips.  Plus the movie can't even keep track of its own timeline.All this could have been forgiven if we got some gutwrenching army n' dragon smackdowns.  Van Zan is supposed to be a fearsome dragon killer so you would figure that he and his militia would have some savvy antidragon tactics figured out from the painful lessons learned by the doomed struggle of the world's armies but no.  When they take on a dragon in the castle environs their plan of attack is so suicidally ludicrous it would take a minor miracle to work just once.  Without going into too much detail it involves groundbased radar monitors a hightech computer tracking system and skydivers all to try and bring the beast to earth so McConaughey can kill it with an axe.  Seriously.The movie has its good points though it is capably directed by TV veteran Rob Bowman who at least manages to imbue the ridiculous proceedings with some sort of dramatic tension.  The climactic battle is pretty impressive and there is an awesome scene of the dragon hovering over the militia while lines of tracers whip through the night sky and the smoke roils under his wings.  Wolf Kroeger's production design isn't bad the landscape is suitably scorched and desperate though it looks like they might have swiped some sets from Enemy at the Gates.  The dragons themselves of course are amazing.  They are truly mean hombres of fluid reptilian grace whose jaws leak flaming liquid as they breathe.  They almost convince you that they really could have destroyed the world that they wouldn't have been swatted from the sky in two seconds by any F18 pilot with half a brain and a rack of heatseekers.  But then you expect great effects from even the most dimwitted of movies these days.Like most monster movies Reign of Fire suffers badly when the monsters are offscreen catching a smoke break and we are left with flat characters speaking silly dialogue in a tepid story.  Bale is all right though his character comes off as something of a weenie.  McConaughey meanwhile has no chemistry with anyone or anything on screen.  He's a buffedout paramilitary psycho but not an interesting one.  You can't figure out how he became the leader maybe he was the only one who could drive a tank. The most engaging character is Alex the helicopter pilot played by Izabella Scorupco the luminous computer expert in GoldenEye who isn't given much attention by the script but who seems like she would have been a better choice to lead the militia.  Too bad she wasn't the main character.But the humans aren't the real stars anyway.  I sort of picture a dragon guzzling an Evian bottle of lighter fluid and barking into his cell phoneI'm telling you Marty I've had it!  C'mon I can fly!  I can breathe fire!  That idiot TRex gets a threepicture deal with Spielberg and what do I get?  First Dungeons  Dragons and now THIS!  Whaddaya doing to me? Get me a meeting with Katzenberg or I torch Burbank.";

	schema:reviewBody "Towards the climax of Seed of Chucky Chucky himself manages to subvert the ENTIRE concept of the ENTIRE series so far and thus most films of its kind by using simple reasoning. I have been dying to hear that from a slasher villain for well...since the birth of slasher villains.What a great time this movie is! Bride of Chucky reinvented what had become a dull unscary franchaise as black comedy. Seed takes that ball and runs with it.

I have been dying to hear that from a slasher villain for well...since the birth of slasher villains.What a great time this movie is!

Chucky is not even the main star of the movie! I have already declared myself as a fan and maybe my view is not entirely unbiased. Still here are some things I particularly enjoyed1. The appearance of John Waters as an actor. Need I say more? Big 2. GlenGlenda who speaks with British accent resembles David Bowie from his Ziggy Stardust phase and has sexualpersonality identity issues. How cool is that? Big 3. Very clear references notably to Psycho Shining Rosemary's Baby and some other movies by Mr. Polanski but more in the form of allusions and even Pinnochio. I am sure there are many more. Big 4. Jennifer Tilly one of the sexiest most sensual intelligent actresses I have ever seen. Ideal for all sorts of subversive films. Of course she is wonderful in this one too. Mmm... Jennifer I love you.

This film can just go to show you how wrong thoughts can be. I heard Glen was going to be in it. I thought he was going to be stupid at first but i was wrong again. Chucky was only in this movie for 30 mins. But that didn't worry me at all. The other characters were interesting as well. No bad characters. just about everything you could ask for. Don Mancini did a great job at directing this movie. This film had everything you could ask for. Glen was a very lovable character. Tiffany came back into it again. And Of course Chucky! It had great actors in it. Jeniffer Tilly really helped this movie along with this movie. She plays a great part. And Introducing Billy Boyd. He played a great character. And Brad Dourif returns as Chucky again! This film is definitely for the Chucky fans. If you are not a Chucky fan then you should not watch this film under any circumstances. This movie also had hilarious bits in it. Such as Britney Spears getting rammed off a cliff. If you are a humungous Chucky fan like me you will not be disappointed at all.".

While Chucky Brad Dourif and his wife Tiffany Jennifer Tilly and their child GlenGlenda Billy Boyd are entertaining the film is really a vehicle for Jennifer Tilly playing herself in other words an exaggerated version of her public persona. And she is incredibly funny and incredibly daring in that role. For me this is the performance of the year. I know that Ms. Tilly has a rabid following who see every film she is in but now I am joining that fold. This film is funny scary a wonderful satire of Hollywood and the cult of celebrity. I don't know why others have put down Redman but he is perfect for his role...also playing an exaggerated version of his public persona. If anyone doesn't get this film then I guess they don't get performers such as Mae West or Jayne Mansfield. With this film Jennifer Tilly should be elevated to that level of greatness. Yes she is a fine actress who can play any kind of role convincingly but she also has an aura about her that one cannot buy or train for. There are a few jokes about Julia Roberts in the film but as Tilly herself surely knows Ms. Roberts could not have gotten away with a role such as this although she did in a way play a similar role in FULL FRONTAL. Writerdirector Don Mancini has hit a grand slam with this film which will surely become a cult classic. Of the hundreds of films I have rated on the IMDb this is one of the dozen or so that deserves an unqualified 10. John Waters is perfect for his role as a sleaze reporterthat he was offered a role in the film shows that the filmmakers surely know their lineage! Finally there is a wonderful musical score by the legendary Italian composer Pino Donaggio. I can't imagine how a Chucky 6 could follow up this film but the minds who created this amazing film can probably surprise us once again. However should they choose to retire the franchise with this entry they will be going out on top. I'll be buying the DVD the day it comes out. And I need to get a picture of Jennifer Tilly for my wall!".

	schema:headline " Seed of Chucky is definitely worth watching!";
	schema:reviewBody "Seed of Chucky is the best horror movie I have ever seen and in my opinion my favorite movie. An example of dark humor. It may also take a little time to understand some of the happenings in this movie. If you're looking for a movie with blood and gore but mostly humor then Seed of Chucky is the movie for you. Seed of Chucky isn't scary at all but is an attention catcher especially for the younger generation. In this movie there is a new addition to the family and it's name is GlenGlenda. Whichever name you want to call it since it's gender confused but I always go with Glen. Believe it or not but this offspring of Chucky and Tiffany is a really adorable cute and wellmannered kid who doesn't want to follow in his dad's footsteps. And did I mention CUTE? But that's not the main idea of this movie. The main idea is that Chucky and Tiffany want to get human bodies for themselves and get Glen one as well. This movie is great and worth watching but then again has blood gore sexual content and humor. If you don't like any of that then I wouldn't suggest watching it. If you've seen the Child's Play movies and didn't like them that doesn't mean that you won't like this movie either. These are two totally different movies and I don't see what's wrong with trying to watch this one. I hope you find this comment helpful and get to enjoy this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Seed of Chucky is the best horror movie I have ever seen and in my opinion my favorite movie. An example of dark humor. It may also take a little time to understand some of the happenings in this movie. If you're looking for a movie with blood and gore but mostly humor then Seed of Chucky is the movie for you. Seed of Chucky isn't scary at all but is an attention catcher especially for the younger generation. In this movie there is a new addition to the family and it's name is GlenGlenda. Whichever name you want to call it since it's gender confused but I always go with Glen. Believe it or not but this offspring of Chucky and Tiffany is a really adorable cute and wellmannered kid who doesn't want to follow in his dad's footsteps. And did I mention CUTE? But that's not the main idea of this movie. The main idea is that Chucky and Tiffany want to get human bodies for themselves and get Glen one as well. This movie is great and worth watching but then again has blood gore sexual content and humor. If you don't like any of that then I wouldn't suggest watching it.

The audience went hysterical. When I walked out of the theater I thought to myself Don Mancini has really reinvented these movies in a way you never thought he would. He's taken a horrifying character Chucky and turned him into a father! A family man! This turns people away from these movies I think but trust me it's not a bad thing!

	schema:reviewBody "Chucky the killer doll voiced by Brad Dourif and his wife Tiffany Jennifer Tilly are back from the dead thanks to their pacifist son Glen voiced by Billy Boyd. For the fifth film in the franchise they head to Hollywood when they learn that a movie is being made about them and of course Chucky and Tiff go on a Hollywood style murder spree which forces their son to try to stop them.What was once a promising franchise is now kind of a joke to watch. The first movie was pretty good offering enough scares and thrills to satisfy the viewer. The second and third films were bad sequels that offered no scares or thrills. The Bride of Chucky was an improvement over the last two sequels but it was still missing something that made the first one good. So where does Seed of Chucky fit in? I'm sad to report that this latest entry is closer to the bad sequels than to the original. It's better than the second and third entry but the film is kind of a dud itself. First there is a lot of gore but the film is not scary. Even the death scenes are a bit disappointing.Second Seed of Chucky is actually more of a comedy than a horror film. The director tries to mix these two genres together and it just doesn't work. Besides for Jennifer Tilly most of the jokes are lame and Chucky is just not that funny. Third Don Mancini really dropped the ball and focused more on the comedy aspect instead of actually trying to put real scares in. The story actually had potential to be scary and it completely failed. The only saving grace in Seed of Chucky is Jennifer Tilly. She offers a funny engaging performance and she's such a good sport for making fun of herself. She is the only thing that keeps this film alive. The rest of the supporting cast include Red Man and Hannah Spearritt. Neither of them do anything special though. For me this film was a major disappointment and I really hope this is the last movie of the franchise. In the end this film is better left on the shelf. Rating 510".

Yes it was ridiculous but had a rather meanspirited edge to it that made you forget how silly it was. Child's Play 2 was less savage but with a touch more humour. Child's Play 3 a film that had an unbelievably bad reputation thanks to moronic tabloids in the UK found the right balance between laughs and scares. Chucky was downright evil but you began to root for him more and more because his oneliners and easily irritable personality became rather er...cute. Ronny Yu's Bride Of Chucky while very gory simply was not a horror film at all  an entertaining black comedy that was ridiculously overthetop yes but not a horror.Now fifth time around series creator Don Mancini steps behind the camera cranks the bad taste all the way up to eleven and delivers the most intelligent dumb film you've ever seen. The horror is nonexistent but the gore is plentiful and the humour sicker than a syphilitic junkie. He rips out all the stop signs with such carefree abandon and directs with such hedonistic pleasure that you can't help pity other directors who take their own material far too seriously.The child born at the end of Bride Of Chucky voiced by Billy Boyd has been picked up by a gruff English new age traveller and made to act in a fakeventriloquist circus show thanks to his bizarre dolllike appearance. He knows he's not normal suffers terrible nightmares of killing and slaughter and is eager to find his real parents.In Hollywood a new movie called Chucky Goes Psycho starring Jennifer Tilly based on the Chucky urban legend is in production and when the young orphan sees a behindthescenes clip of what can only be his real mum and dad on TV he escapes to Tinseltown to find out why they abandoned him. The obligatory chant to the almighty voodoo god Damballa resurrects Chucky and Tiffany who are more than delighted to be together with their own child. Trouble is they can't decide whether he's a boy or a girl  a Glen or a Glenda.However the killer dolls are still keen to get out of their plastic bodies once and for all and be human again. Obviously Tiffany is partial to Jennifer Tilly's body and Chucky aims to switch places with rapperactordirector Redman who is planning a new Jesus Christ movie. As you can imagine many deaths occur along the way much to the distress of GlenGlenda.It sounds sameoldsameold but let me assure you that Mancini crams as much daft humour and sick jokes in as possible. John Waters  the King of Bad Taste himself  has a hilarious extended cameo as a sleazy tabloid photographer who happens to snap a silhouetted image of Chucky hammering one off to a porno mag. How crazy is that? Chucky himself is a wonderful comic character. You just can't help but love him. Don't you think that he and Tiffany make a cute couple? He may be short but he's far scarier than Michael Myers ever was and his mere presence makes every scene a riot.Seed Of Chucky is not a film for everyone. You have to be pretty openminded to endure the morbid humour but it's the guiltiest pleasure you're likely to have for a long time. The selfaware Hollywood references never become intrusive and the convoluted story never becomes confusing. Still as I have said it's not easy going entertainment if you're a stuffy conservative.All fans of gore and brainless amusement must see. Oh and in case you recognise the actor playing Jennifer Tilly's lawyer that's Nicholas Rowe better known as Young Sherlock Holmes.".

Oh and in case you recognise the actor playing Jennifer Tilly's lawyer that's Nicholas Rowe better known as Young Sherlock Holmes.";

I'm a huge horror fan. I love this rubbish. As you all probably know by now Seed of Chucky is Not a scary movie its camp horror which I also like. There was a lot about this I liked and a lot I didn't. I'll start with likes. It's very funny. Jennifer Tilly was very funny. Second off Brad Dourif is still the man. For any fan of the series its always great to hear his oneliners and hear him swear. Someing about potty mouths on dolls just appeals to me. Also there was a lot of blood and gore in the select scenes with blood and gore. But that leads me to what i don't like about this movie. There wasn't a whole lot of death going around. Honestly about five people bite it in this movie. Chucky is the supernaturally possessed doll of a serial killer but really he doesn't kill anyone and it makes me very mad. Another thing i didn't like about this movie is the fact that the GlenGlenda doll exists in the first place. I couldn't stand his voice and heshes a wimp. Could of done without him. I hope the next Chucky movie is about him killing nonstop. Make him scary again. I mean they made Freddy scary again 11 years ago they can do it to Chucky.Anyway this is a pretty good flick but I cant wait for the new DVD. And everyone should buy it so they make another one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jon Peters' first production as he transformed himself with girlfriend Barbra Streisand's help from hairdresser to movie producer the movie is a gem of Seventies style at it's finest. The clothes the hair makeup music attitude interiors and locations ride the crest of the highstyle wave that flooded the world through the Eighties. Combining the improbable worlds of violence and fashion with a story that centers on a famous photographer Dunaway and her ability to see her friends and colleagues being stalked and murdered Eyes has moments of serious suspense but that's hardly the reason to see this movie. Utilizing the actual photography of fashion god Helmut Newton the film maker has exquisitely captured the 1978 New York fashion and disco scene in a way that none of the recent looks at the Seventies has been able to but then again this movie was made in 1978 not 27 years later. The scenes of photo shoots are particularly fun to watch with one scene portraying a burning car crash in Columbus Circle in which the models clad in garter belts and fur coats catfight before the camera. The ingenuous use of real models add the precise amount of vacuity necessary to make the surreal shot work. Another photo shoot involves a model dead from a gunshot to his heart lying in a pool surrounded by exotically dressed discodancing models and a throbbing disco beat. The plot is secondary to style in this movie and style is the only reason this movie should be remembered. Favorite moment Darlanne Fluegel as the model Lulu haplessly trying to explain to the press why violence is important in fashion photos.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sure....  Compared to the thrillers of today  it just can't compare.  It seems low budget and 3rd world in quality.  But it's got so much more beneath the surface.The plot is simple  a 'High Fashion' photographer Laura Mars begins to have visions of brutal murders  both when sleeping and while awake.  Some of these visions begin to seep into her work and her images.  But soon the visions begin to include many of her friends acquaintances and coworkers. A homicide detective John Neville assigned to the case begins hanging around and trying to solve the case including the murders involving Laura's friends.  Many of Laura's friends  acquaintances get killed along the way leaving her emotionally bereft and open to Neville's advances.  I won't blow the end of the film as others may by giving away the twists and turns.There are a few decent performances in the movie  including Rene Auberjunois as Laura's 'flamboyantly flaming' manager assistant and best friend.  And how he can wear a dress....This stylish  sometimes sexy thriller is an 8 of 10 when the age of the flick comes into consideration.  Decent plot decent acting and decent twists.  And I am sorry but Barbara Streisand's opening song still stands as one of my all time favorite songs....  Speaking of the opening the opening credits of the film are kinda creepy and chilling.  Go rent it and decide for yourself!".

	onyx:emotionText "Sure....  Compared to the thrillers of today  it just can't compare.  It seems low budget and 3rd world in quality.  But it's got so much more beneath the surface.The plot is simple  a 'High Fashion' photographer Laura Mars begins to have visions of brutal murders  both when sleeping and while awake.  Some of these visions begin to seep into her work and her images.  But soon the visions begin to include many of her friends acquaintances and coworkers. A homicide detective John Neville assigned to the case begins hanging around and trying to solve the case including the murders involving Laura's friends.  Many of Laura's friends  acquaintances get killed along the way leaving her emotionally bereft and open to Neville's advances.  I won't blow the end of the film as others may by giving away the twists and turns.There are a few decent performances in the movie  including Rene Auberjunois as Laura's 'flamboyantly flaming' manager assistant and best friend.  And how he can wear a dress....This stylish  sometimes sexy thriller is an 8 of 10 when the age of the flick comes into consideration.  Decent plot decent acting and decent twists.  And I am sorry but Barbara Streisand's opening song still stands as one of my all time favorite songs....  Speaking of the opening the opening credits of the film are kinda creepy and chilling.  Go rent it and decide for yourself!";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Eyes of Laura Mars a few years ago and just watched it again very recently. I remembered it as being fantastic but upon watching it again I was a little disappointed. It's a solid film by no means bad it's just nothing all that special.For the past 3 years or so I've been totally hooked on giallo's and this film plays in a lot of ways like an homage to those Italian thrillers. Touches here and there remind you of Dario Argento obsessive mirror imagery Laura's visions etc. Lucio Fulci Sergio Martino and Mario Bava such as the model settings and murder scenarios. While this film scores heavy on style and music though I find this soundtrack a bit hokey but generally OK it just lacks the magic that the best giallo's seem to have. The plot while intriguing enough is not nearly played out to it's full potential. There are gripping scenes here to be sure but the film drags quite a bit and nothing virtually happens for a long period of time.For seasoned giallo fans we know the killer is most definitely gonna be the most unlikely one and for a lack of suspects I didn't find it hard to figure out who was guilty but there's pretty much no logic to support it but that's a giallo trademark a pro rather than a con actually. For me the problem is that this film doesn't have the same trashy feel and atmosphere as the best Italian thrillers it seems to be imitating. In a lot of ways I like this film certain scenes are truly gripping but there's simply something lacking. Being a huge fan of John Carpenter I can't help but think what he could have done had he directed this. He came up with the story and shares the credits as the writer of the screenplay and what's more he loves the Italian giallo films as well. His own homage to the genre Someone's Watching Me the little known TV film was terrific and you could see that he definitely had the feel for the genre and could easily translate it to American settings. I don't feel that Kershner as good a director as he is has the same love for the genre as Carpenter.I recommend watching it it scores on a number of levels.".

Other movies that come to mind are 1971's Klute and 1977's Looking for Mr. Goodbar. I would even throw 1970's Joe' into that mix with it's take on free love and nudity. What's kind of funny as I watched the picture today on cable was that the exposed breasts of women in Laura Mars' photos were uncensored but the ones on the live models were. What's the point of that? There's that other element that gets some treatment from the newspaper reporter in the story speculating on whether the gallery photo exhibit has a desensitizing effect on society and might possibly be the cause of some deranged killer who gets inspired by the titillation of sex and violence together. There are those primarily in the position of making these pictures that think that's all hogwash but why wouldn't a rational person make the same observation. Sometimes bad ideas get their start in a subliminal way.Anyway this was a fair enough thriller. Trying to figure out the murderer in a murder mystery can often be a challenging exercise but this film tried too hard to pin the crimes on Brad Dourif's character so I had him dismissed right off. That John Neville Tommy Lee Jones turned out to be the killer in Laura's visions wasn't a complete surprise though the picture could have better explored at which point in his life Neville went completely off the rails. The confrontational scene in which Laura realizes in horror that John is a madman was handled well I was patiently waiting for her to pull the trigger and she didn't let me down. Good job Laura.".

She seemed to start many scenes playing just that but would then quickly fall to pieces and appear to not know where she was what she was doing or how to answer a simple question. This happens over and over. I felt like I was watching over acting from the 40s.The rest of the cast saved it for me. Especially Brad Dourif and Tommy Lee Jones.I liked the general story and premise but even at only 104 minutes it felt drawnout. A lot of people seem to think the ending was predictable.

It becomes more traditional but it needs to stay with the first person POV. Otherwise it's a nice premise and the visual mostly works. It has blood and gore but like the photos they are too stagey. The first thing that caught my eye is the writing credit for John Carpenter. This is preHalloween by a couple of months. If it somehow got released after Halloween I'm sure they would have promoted Carpenter's script to death and it would be an even bigger hit. The great cast is doing good work.

	schema:reviewBody "The Eyes of Laura Mars 1978A thriller with a twist of course but depending too much on the first impression of that twist and not developing it as we go. What always pains me about thrillers like this is they assume we are happy to watch and have things unfold for us without our involvement. Not that we aren't shocked by blood and death but we are not given clues or hints even false hints to make us start to figure out what is going on and who did what. Instead we just watch another and another of these quirky awful murders. And watching isn't enough. This isn't a terrible movie but it has the aura of something more original and special. Expect a common murder spree with a romance thrown in and you'll enjoy it.There might be a hidden and unintended metaphor in the film about us as consumers watching the unapproachable supermodels who are the underlying landscape of the film. Echoes of Jack the Ripper are faint and cheap. And women over and over again as with lots of 1970s movies are just eye candy both as actresses and as models for the photography. Throw in glamorized murder and you have what could have been a disturbing and brilliant film. But far from it.Beauty is what it is but Faye Dunaway struts as if she's the creme de la creme and in fact her stiff haughtiness bleeds into her part. Some depth and surprise in her performance would have helped a lot. It's fun seeing Tommy Lee Jones in a young hunky role and he's pretty good if not loosened up and amazing as he would later be.A lot of this might be traced to the director who like it or not is responsible for pulling it all together and getting the most out of everyone. Irvin Kerschner has a short resume and no particular style. The trick of this film the photographer's visions are scary and a little inventive but their effect is dampened by effects. That is the visual dimming and blurring is what it is easily digested and the events don't add up to anything more than just a quick murder each time. No fun at all and slightly sad.The photography itself? It looks like slick Helmut Newton Newton was slick of course but with a wiry edge to his setups and it makes me think of Ellen Von Untwerth who made shocking scenes pretty in the same kind of way. Ah I read now the photos were by Newton with the help of Rebecca Blake who I've never heard of. Newton was famous for his misogynist and high brow fashion work often using nudity beyond the norm for his days in the 1960s and 70s. Any critique of that kind of abusive photography one might read into the movie is blunted by the fact that the photographer here is a woman.In the end the movie survives on style and it does have a really nice feel to it not in how it was filmed but in the subject matter.".

Eyes of Laura Mars is the perfect example to state this. The supernatural premise penned down by no less than John Carpenter Halloween Assault on Precinct 13 is undoubtedly intriguing and rich on artistic opportunities yet due to an incredible amount of production difficulties and constant rewritings of the script it ended up being a hopelessly muddled and disappointing thriller. Carpenter gave up when he saw that his original idea got slowly turned into a gimmicky mystery revolving more on the glossy charisma of its lead actress than on the actual trump of film a series of bizarre murders in the world of professional photography. Faye Dunaway stars as the female version of the controversial reallife artist Helmut Newton and exhibits shockprovoking photos that portray death mayhem and prostitution in New York City. Suddenly and for reasons that remain unexplained she can witness with her own eyes how a gloved serial killer brutally stabs her closest friends  coworkers to death. Laura's descriptions appear identical to how the murders were committed and thus the handsome Detective John Neville personally takes pity on her as she unquestionably will become the killer's main target. Experienced horrorthriller fans that are slightly familiar with Italian cinema will immediately spot the similarities between this film and the typical gialli  violent Italian murdermysteries of 70's and early 80's. Eyes of Laura Mars contains multiple trademarks of the giallo but sadly lacks the stuff that makes them so fantastic namely bloody gore and sleaze. Style  substance characteristics are definitely well presented bizarre title far fetched psychic sub plots implausible red herrings left and right an insane denouement silly music You almost get the impression that producer Jon Peters WANTED to make an American attempt to giallo but eventually didn't had the courage to make it as demented as it should be! Eyes of Laura Mars is a tedious and slowpaced film with castmembers that perform below their normal skill and a director that didn't really knew what he was doing.

In one very effective sequence the killer is chasing Dunaway and she sees herself being chased by him! I liked it but it's a bit depressingbasically EVERYONE Dunaway knew is killed by the end! Also she has an incredible apartment love the mirrors in the bedroom and the picture of the book on her is greatand was also used as the movie poster. And John Carpenter wrote the story! Dunaway is just great in a difficult role Raul Julia is good in a small role and so is Rene Auberjonois.

	schema:headline " Predictable and badly plotted 'suspense' thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Eyes of Laura Mars isn't a very well known film and there's a good reason for that it's not very good. The premise isn't bad and there are a few good ideas but the execution is poor on the whole and for every idea that does work there's at least three that don't. Take the main idea for example  the plot follows Laura Mars a New York artist who has blackouts during which she witnesses the murderous rampages of the local serial killer. We then follow her and her policeman boyfriend as they try to track down the killer from her visions. Now this is all well and good but the film has completely forgotten to explain WHY this is happening to her thus making it really hard for the audience to care about the plot. It didn't come as a surprise to me to find that John Carpenter wrote the script. After that many other areas of the film aren't explained properly. The movie throws caution to the wind where characters are concerned and they are merely a product of the plot itself rather than the plot being impacted by the characters. This is a guaranteed formula for a cold audience as it's hard to care anyway but when it doesn't even give you reason to care for the characters themselves it's too easy to switch off.Faye Dunaway has starred in some big films such as Chinatown and Bonnie and Clyde but her performance here isn't up there with those films. To be fair she isn't given much to do  but despite convincing as New Yorker she cant get into her character and on the whole her performance isn't the work of a great actress. Tommy Lee Jones would go on to find real fame after this film so it's a good job that he had some better roles later on as his performance here is unlikely to have gained him many plaudits. Cult actor Brad Dourif rounds off the central core of actors and he as usual stands out the most. Also as usual his performance isn't anything like brilliant but Dourif knows how to entertain. The final nail in the coffin for this film is definitely the final twist. Usually I have to start watching a film before the twist becomes guessable but I guessed this one before I even saw the movie. Just reading the plot synopsis makes it obvious. On the whole this film isn't a complete dead loss and if you like your supernatural thrillers there may be something here. Just be prepared to allow it some room in the credibility department.".

Both love their country and they learn that love of man or of woman and of country can be expressed differently and still be valued and respected. It is a wonderful charming endearing and thoroughly well acted movie. It is extremely realistic and gives and shows a snapshot of Cuba we are not able to see or partake of. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is funny well acted and well written and directed. The two male leads are superior as is the female character.

	schema:reviewBody "Strawberry and Chocolate' 1993is set in contemporary Havana. The luster of that city has dimmed after nearly four decades of Castro's rule. David Vladimir Cruz a student and avid Castro supporter is on the rebound after losing his girlfriend. He had taken her to a cheap hotel to make love but the place is so shabby it puts her off. Instead he promises never to touch her until they marry. In the next scene she marries someone else while David stands sullenly among the well wishers at the registry office. Then he meets Diego Jorge Perugorra.            Diego who is flamboyantly gay parks himself at David's table in an outdoor caf to eat a dish of strawberry ice cream. For David this is suspicious because chocolate is also available. Diego says some people like chocolate some like strawberry an innocuous line that gives the movie its title and also hints at the odd couple relationship to follow.            Diego does not disguise his sexual interest in David but is also interested in giving David an education the regime denies him. The older man is far more cultured than his new friend. Offers of books banned in Castro's Cuba such as a novel by Mario Vargas Llosa or the poems of John Donne lure David to his apartment for tea and talk. When David reports that Diego is involved with a forbidden art exhibit he is directed to befriend Diego to find out more information. Strawberry and Chocolate' thus sets their emerging friendship against the backdrop of two bleak themes antigay prejudice in the Castro regime and the betraythyneighbor expectation of a police state.            But almost nobody conforms to type. A woman in Diego's building who is part of the neighborhood Vigilance Committee on the watch for counterrevolutionary activities turns out to be a good friend to Diego and then to David. Everyone plays one game with the government but a different one in their private lives. This is a lesson David has to learn. Encounters with women along the way provide a few subplots but the heart of the story lies in the hearts of the two men.            Strawberry and Chocolate' is credited to directors Toms Gutirrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabo. The former was until his death shortly after completing this film the best known filmmaker in Cuba winning an international reputation in the 1960's for titles such as Memoirs of Underdevelopment' a look at life in Cuba in the early Castro years that tempers criticism with prudence. Strawberry' is smaller in scale and less overtly political.             The film was nominated for an Oscar in 1995 and won awards at film festivals around the world including the Sundance Festival. American viewers may instantly slot it with Hollywood features that show how straight characters learn life lessons from a wiser gay companion Boys on the Side' As Good As It Gets'. And at times Diego's excesses recall the worst performances of Harvey Fierstein. Yet superb performances by the two male leads eventually move beyond stereotypes they  and the audience  initially share about each other transforming their unexpected friendship into a statement that puts the lie to official groupthink in a repressive regime.".

The scenes of Havana are beautiful and heartbreaking.  This film conveys what it must feel like for Cubans to leave their country and how difficult that is.  It's also about learning to think for yourself and to have opinions and do things that others might not find politically correct.  There's nothing subversive about this movie and nothing that you need to hide from the kids. In fact I recommend that people show the film to their teenagers and talk about it because it sends such a great message about accepting people as they are.

What makes this film extraordinary is that it was made by a Cuban director who had been himself part of the Communist intelligenzia at the beginning but could still be objective and therefore critical of the intolerance of real socialism.  What also makes the film extraordinary is that the film itself was a box office success in Cuba and helped change attitudes towards homosexuality. Toms Gutirrez Alea or Titn as he was known in Cuba is the greatest and best loved Cuban filmmaker with a trademark black humour best exemplified in his outstanding films Memorias del subdesarrollo Memories of Underdevelopment 1968 and La Muerte de un burcrata Death of a Bureaucrat 1966. His last film Guantanamera 1994 which he made when ill with cancer is a black comedy of funeral errors and criticism of Cuban bureaucracy. This is his legacy the way he wanted his public to remember him laughing at death.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strawberry and Chocolate  Wow this was a wonderful surprise and one of the better movies I've seen of late.  Set in 90's Havana this is a very real believable story of a young homophobes first friendship with a gay man.  I found the movie touching and funny and it reminded so much of many men I knew during my years in El Paso.Diego played wonderfully by Cuban actor Jorge Perugorria is very attractive and yet easily the queeniest guy I've seen on film in years.  I really enjoyed how comfortable he seemed in the role paying in between the male and female gender roles. This man has a passion for life that he expresses while being outside the mainstream.  He does an excellent job of pulling off the crush in a believable way.He has a horrible crush on David a young Communist party member who is lured to Diego's apartment with the promise of some photos of Diego took of him while David was acting.  No pictures materialized and the two develop a solid respectful platonic relationship.This movie shows that gay and straight men can be friends.  It also reminded me of many good times I had by making friends with people I normally wouldn't associate with.  Queens are usually not my type...but then again its a reminder to judge people by the content of their character rather than superficial appearances.The film also explores Cuban's acceptance of Communism and the country's desire to remain outside the influence of American commercialism.  I was very interested to see where Diego's antigovernment rhetoric would get him and if the movie would have a moralistic 'gotcha' message at the end.In reading about this movie it's pleasing to know that the director is a wellknown and respected Cuban director thus making it a bit easier to trust the movie and the movie was well received in Cuba.  Word is it helped to remove the stigma attached to homosexuality in Cuba.I heartily recommend this film in a way I so rarely do.  Easily in the same class as Priscilla for humanity and believability.  This one is absolutely worth whatever it takes to find it.Rating 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fresa y chocolateI liked to watch Fresa y Chocolate this is first Cuban movie I've seen. Fresa y Chocolate is a product of two directors Toms Gutirrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabo in 1993. Fresa y Chocolate was nominated in 1995 the best foreign film. During the production of this film the director Alea had cancer and for this reason Tabo had to help him to complete the movie. Later 1996 Alea die. This movie expresses the oppression of Cuban government toward the homosexual and the conflict also the friendship within two different men. Around 1997 in CubaDiego Jorge Perugorria  the main character is a cultured gay and David Vldimir Cruz a young revolutionary college student. He is a naive and dogmatic. The story begins at a cheap hotel room where David and his sweetheart Vivian tried to have first intimate experience together but ended up angry at each other later Vivian marries to a much older man who is in the government office position. David the wedding day feeling low come to an Ice cream shop near by school and over there David and Diego meet. At the begging it was Diego's attempt to allure David but soon it change and in spite of their sexuality these two different men establish a true friendship. Most of story take a place at Diego's apartment where full of things art work forbidden books pictures... for David's eye. It is a new and different world for David a dogmatic and in a way an ignorant. Diego tells David about his anguish and problem toward the government. For him being homosexual hinder his work in Cuba and also his well being too.However David learns much about art and literature from Diego and moreover he learn how to enjoy and savor life. The message of this movie is tolerance. No matter what is one's sexuality people have genuine heart. They have hope dreams and frustration that life brings us.I think this movie is worth to watch because Fresa y Chocolate gave me a chance to give a glance to Cuba the country that I don't know yet. To me watching a good film lessens a tension of life.".

I don't know anything about homosexuality in Cuba though my guess is that it was rather taboo in 1993 much like in most of the western world.

	schema:reviewBody "Strawberry and Chocolate is definitely one of the best foreign films I've seen so far.  It's both entertaining and moving.  In the opening scenes I couldn't help but laugh at the fishoutofwater interactions between the main character and the gay man.  But the actor who plays the gay man isn't a walking stereotype.  He shows many feminine characteristics but not in a way that he seems to be almost laughing at himself.  Often times gay men feel like women stuck in men's bodies so it's only natural that they act feminine but that doesn't mean all they talk about is which guys they think are hot and their longing for promiscuous sex.  During those interactions the gay man hits on the main character but that's because he's a handsome guy.  If a straight man were to meet a pretty girl he'd hit on her too. Only that wouldn't be disputed because heterosexuality is considered normal.  But the gay man's advances aren't too forward and he doesn't start harassing him or anything.The friendship between the two characters develops slowly but realistically.  You can't expect an average heterosexual man to immediately click with a homosexual.  During their later conversations the gay man expresses more of his emotions and how he's shunned by society.  Of course we've seen other movies where gay characters express their disgust for being treated as thirdclass citizens but in this case I felt connected to the characters to the point where it didn't feel like a plot device.  As I said the relationship develops naturally and not through sentimental coincidence.Some directors would augment the relationship to the point where the main character decides that he himself is gay.  But what are the chances that'll happen in reality?  I have some gay friends but that doesn't tempt me to like men as well.  In fact I still cringe when certain gay friends of mine talk about their sexual episodes.  In this film the main character remains straight and even falls in love with the man's older nextdoor neighbor. I enjoyed that little subplot and felt it strengthened the narrative instead of driving it off course.  The nextdoor neighbor also adds more comic relief to the film with her quick wits.The acting is excellent.  Aside from the actor who plays the gay character who I feel gave a tour de force the main actor also delivers.  His reactions are very genuine as he's sort of the straight man no pun intended seriously feeding off his costar's energy.  The film is directed the same team who made Guantanamera another independent gem which I had the pleasure of watching in one of my previous film classes.  The two movies show the directors' knacks for telling an engaging story that can be both riotously funny and incredibly moving.My score  9 out of 10".

	schema:headline " A neutral and warm portrait of Cuban society in the 90's";
	schema:reviewBody "When we hear about Cuba what usually comes to mind is its communist regime. It's one of the traits that distinguish the island from the other Caribbean and Latin American countries in general. Therefore when talking about a Cuban film it's quite tempting to make some political remarks. That is unavoidable with Fresa y Chocolate a 1993 film that's loaded with political content but without a clear sense of ideological propaganda against or in favour of the system.The story begins when a university student member of the Communist Party meets a gay artist who doesn't like the regime. Davi the communist boy with the support of a roommate who's also a party member decides to investigate the life of Diego the political dissident with the aim of denouncing him to the authorities. However the relationship between the informal investigator and the suspect assumes unexpected features giving place to a sincere friendship that leads the naive Davi to understand and to learn how to deal with the subversive differences represented by Diego.Some subtle criticisms are made about the regime whose authoritarian nature is exemplified by the episode in which Diego tries to obtain a permit for an art exhibition. The harmless sculptures made by his friend Germn are banned and Diego feels the reason for that is simple works of art that are free of ideological propaganda in favour of the regime have no place in the island of Fidel Castro.At home Diego often has to turn on the radio at a volume high enough so the neighbours won't be able to hear some of his conversations that might sound like defying the official ideology. It might be seen as a criticism against the lack of freedom of thought that's typical of authoritarian regimes but it might also be interpreted as a proof of the high popular support for that same regime even your neighbors collaborate with the authorities in the repression of political dissent.Nevertheless there's also place for apologetic comments about the regime as when Davi emphasizes the fact that he can go to university despite being the son of peasant parents.Leaving aside the political element the human relationship between Diego and Davi unfolds in a captivating and convincing way. Davi is the typical straight guy who fears having his masculinity shaken by the contact with gay men. But little by little he lets his defences fall down until he's open enough for creating a trustful and intimate relationship with his new friend.Meanwhile Diego is an effeminate man who has an intense love for art in general and shows an atypical erudition. At first he shows a strong sexual interest in Davi but he soon realizes that the young communist man is an irreversible straight guy and then he stops his flirtatious behaviour and chooses to build a disinterested friendship instead.Some moments make it clear that homosexuality is frowned upon by the official ideology. Homophobic remarks are often made by Davi's communist roommate. He's even accused of having an affair with Diego. Davi himself asks Diego why his family didn't take him to the doctor as a child so he could be cured from that endocrinal disease. Diego laughs and says that being gay is something that has happened since the dawn of the world and that it doesn't prevent him from being a decent and patriotic person. But Davi insists that homosexuality prevents him from being a revolutionary.Fresa y Chocolate is at the same time enjoyable and thought provoking and gives us an opportunity to observe a portrait of the Cuban society from a surprisingly impartial perspective.".

And although the film is set in communist Cuba and is about a gay man you can enjoy the film regardless of your orientation political or sexual. It's simply well made and interesting.David is a very straight young man who is an unquestioning lover of the Cuban revolution. One day he's approached by Diego and lured to Diego's apartment. However because David is certainly not gay Diego's conquest never occurs and David leaves. When David tells a friend about this this friend encourages David to return to spy on Diego. After all he's a gay religious man and has international ideasand MUST be an enemy of the state. Something strange happens however and Diego and David become friendssomething that challenges both of them. Diego must learn to deal with a nonsexual male friend and David must realize that you can still love your country without being straight or having a love of life outside Cuba.The film works mostly because the acting is quite nice and the story universal. Even with a few antiAmerican remarks at one point the film is one anyone can enjoy. And I was surprised that this Cuban film was willing to question what it is to be patrioticand how Cuba in 1993 was not exactly tolerant when it came to homosexuality. Fascinating.By the way there is a reasonable amount of nudity in this one so you may want to think twice about having younger folks watch the film.".

	schema:headline " A refreshing nonformulaic movie with an effective approach about a sensitive Cuban subject.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a rather good and surprising Cuban movie focusing on homosexuality in Communist Cuba. It's not the sort of movie you expect coming from Cuba and on top of that it also isn't a movie that stays on the surface but goes in into the subject real deep.It's not a movie that focuses on the physical relationship between the two main characters but more between the spiritual relationship of the two which is a surprising approach. So it's not a 'standard' movie about two man falling in love with each other as you at first might expect when watching this movie. It's a movie that goes much deeper and therefor gets more layered interesting and compelling to watch. It's great to see how the two of them grow toward each other in a nonforced or formulaic way. It feels like a warm and very realistic movie since it never chooses to diverse from its main plotline and mainly focuses purely on the two main characters of the movie.Vladimir Cruz gives a good and realistic performance. But one thing that bothered me about him was that he was very popular in both male and female camp which seemed weird and funny to me since he really didn't looked like an handsome guy. But who knows maybe this is the Cuban's idea of a pretty looking man. Jorge Perugorra also did a good job although he performance as an homosexual character seemed a bit too feminine and overthetop to me at certain points. He played the character like an obvious stereotype of a gay person but he did it in such a good and sincere way that it wasn't always a problem.I was also surprised by the look and overall atmosphere of the movie. Foreign movies made outside of Cuba always focus and shows its visual beauty of wide beaches palms beautiful music and people living there. It's a sort of an almost surreal and alternate world if you look at it. This movie is however more dark and gritty and shows the ugly side of Havana both visually as with its themes and underlying comments.Some of the symbolism and underlying messages in the dialog are a bit too obvious as if they were trying too hard but this is perhaps the only real flaw in the movie its excellent story and directing of the movie.Don't know why the movie is often being regarded and treated as a comedy. It's above all an heavy drama but done in a light and more pleasant sort of way but those are no reasons for me to regard this movie as a comedy. The movie uses the more European style and approach of the story and characters. So be sure what to expect when watching this movie.A great and relevant movie because of its themes and I assume also a big step forward for gayright and tolerance in Cuba.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

In other words it's as difficult for a gay and straight man to develop a friendship as it is for a straight man and woman. Sounds a bit like dating and marriage doesn't it? It's even more difficult when a government and friends interfere.At the beginning I was afraid that Diego would actually seduce David and voil we have the usual gay film that I find boring. Instead I really got to like Diego much the same way he eventually charms David. That's getting involved with characters in a movie. Excellent performances by the two leads.The other performance that is compelling is that of Nancy Mirtha Ibarra. I first saw Mirtha Ibarra in Guantanamara a film that followed this by a year. In both films she plays the older woman that every young man fantasizes about. Where was Mirtha Ibarra when I was David's age? I don't know how if the Cuban regime is supposed to be so oppressive that they allowed this film to be made.

	schema:reviewBody "Homosexuality is something that is not accepted in many countries and this Cuban movie is based in this sentiment. The dramaticcomedy Strawberry and Chocolate was directed by Toms Gutirrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabo and was an adaptation of the story The wolf the forest and the new man by Senel Paz. This movie represents very well the sentiment against homosexuality that still exists. Vladimir Cruz plays the part of David the protagonist the new man in Paz's words and Jorge Perugorra plays the part of Diego the wolf.The plot begins in Havana with David and his failed attempt to make love to his girlfriend Vivian. It continues later on Vivian's wedding day with another man while David watches them from the background. Depressed David goes to the ice cream stand and meets Diego who is clearly homosexual. Diego invites him to his apartment but David flees suddenly because Diego is very strange. He later returns to the apartment because he is under the pressure of his roommate Manuel to investigate the queer. Friendship begins to grow between David and Diego. Diego is smart knows a lot about art and culture and teaches these things to his friend. The friendship between David and Nancy one of Diego's friends grows as well and they make love at the end of the movie. But Diego is in trouble after sending a letter that ridicules the government for not accepting his art exhibition and for this reason the government kicks him out and he has to leave the country. The movie ends with a touching hug between Diego and David. I like the plot because it uses elements of comedy to demonstrate a serious theme and I thing that this works well.There are two themes that clearly exist in this movie friendship and tolerance. True friendship can only exist when two people accept each other as they are not only physically but on the inside as well. For example friendship is nonexistent between Manuel and David because Manuel doesn't care about David's personality rather his actions. By the end David and Diego adore each other for all the qualities they have and do not worry about physical things. Tolerance is something different and is important as well. Many people in Cuba demonstrated in Manuel and other countries can't change their thoughts about homosexuality because they are too strong and unmovable. David's tolerance for Diego grows during the progression of the movie and it is realized at the end with a hug between friends.The use of light works well to show the mood of the movie. The darkness at the beginning shows the feeling that they are doing something bad or dirty and the brightness when David and Diego are in the hideout Diego's apartment at the end of the movie shows that things will be fine. The acting is good and adds to the movie. Sometimes Perugorra's acting is too cheesy but it works to show his strange character. Through Cruz's good acting one can clearly see David's emotional growth with his new friendship with Diego the strange guy.In reality people do not accept a change from the norm and this is true especially with homosexuality. Homosexuals still fight today in many countries for their rights but many people still don't accept them. This movie shows us very well this feeling through drama but also with a few moments of humor. I would recommend this to my friends because it isn't too serious but nonetheless has a moving message for the viewer.".

Vladimir Cruz plays the part of David the protagonist the new man in Paz's words and Jorge Perugorra plays the part of Diego the wolf.The plot begins in Havana with David and his failed attempt to make love to his girlfriend Vivian. It continues later on Vivian's wedding day with another man while David watches them from the background. Depressed David goes to the ice cream stand and meets Diego who is clearly homosexual. Diego invites him to his apartment but David flees suddenly because Diego is very strange. He later returns to the apartment because he is under the pressure of his roommate Manuel to investigate the queer. Friendship begins to grow between David and Diego. Diego is smart knows a lot about art and culture and teaches these things to his friend. The friendship between David and Nancy one of Diego's friends grows as well and they make love at the end of the movie. But Diego is in trouble after sending a letter that ridicules the government for not accepting his art exhibition and for this reason the government kicks him out and he has to leave the country. The movie ends with a touching hug between Diego and David. I like the plot because it uses elements of comedy to demonstrate a serious theme and I thing that this works well.There are two themes that clearly exist in this movie friendship and tolerance. True friendship can only exist when two people accept each other as they are not only physically but on the inside as well. For example friendship is nonexistent between Manuel and David because Manuel doesn't care about David's personality rather his actions. By the end David and Diego adore each other for all the qualities they have and do not worry about physical things. Tolerance is something different and is important as well. Many people in Cuba demonstrated in Manuel and other countries can't change their thoughts about homosexuality because they are too strong and unmovable. David's tolerance for Diego grows during the progression of the movie and it is realized at the end with a hug between friends.The use of light works well to show the mood of the movie. The darkness at the beginning shows the feeling that they are doing something bad or dirty and the brightness when David and Diego are in the hideout Diego's apartment at the end of the movie shows that things will be fine. The acting is good and adds to the movie. Sometimes Perugorra's acting is too cheesy but it works to show his strange character. Through Cruz's good acting one can clearly see David's emotional growth with his new friendship with Diego the strange guy.In reality people do not accept a change from the norm and this is true especially with homosexuality. Homosexuals still fight today in many countries for their rights but many people still don't accept them. This movie shows us very well this feeling through drama but also with a few moments of humor. I would recommend this to my friends because it isn't too serious but nonetheless has a moving message for the viewer.";

	schema:headline " A gripping dramatic thriller that works thanks to the terrific performances.";
	schema:reviewBody " out of Brokedown Palace has an intriguing premise two best friends Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes fresh from high school are on their summer vacation in Thailand but are arrested for possession of narcotics found guilty and sentenced to 33 years in a women's prison.  Admittedly I'm aware of several films with similar stories Midnight Express Return to Paradise and Red Corner and I must also admit I've only see one of those three aforementioned films which might be why much of it felt fresh and engrossing to me.  Either that or it's just a story that's told damn well.Bill Pullman also stars in the picture as an American lawyer named Hank Greene who feels for the girls' plight and fights to prove their innocence. But the real focus is on Beckinsale and Danes whose wonderful performances are the anchor to the film's drama and moral quandaries.  Beckinsale's Darlene is the more reserved and quieter of the two the kind of person who sort of follows her friend without question and certainly not the type to take unwarranted risks unless her friend persuades her to.  She's almost a direct opposite of Danes' Alice whose outgoing and semirebellious behavior is the indirect link to their current troubles.I hesitate to give much more of the movie away suffice to say that their friendship is what's ultimately put to the test and watching the twists and turns almost all of which are perfectly believable in the story is utterly captivating.  The film slinks to melodrama in its climactic moments but still rings true thanks to the tourdeforce turns from Beckinsale and Danes.It's an openended question as to whether or not either of the girls committed the crime of smuggling narcotics and such ambiguity might upset some but I liked not knowing for certain and it's not as if it makes the final scenes any less believable.  In fact the ambiguity only makes it all the more compelling.  Yes the plot has its share of headscratching moments what purpose does that Thai girl who despises Darlene and Alice really serve? and lacks subtlety on occasion but it's a wellcrafted film that boasts great performances and has the guts not to cop out in the end.".

	schema:headline " My number one favorite movie and is perfect in every way to me";
	schema:reviewBody "Where should I begin with how much I cherish and praise this absolute masterpiece? Let me start off with how I came upon it I remember it perfectly. I was staying the night at my sister's house one night and it was after she and my nephew had fallen asleep that I had watched a few films already and still really had nothing better to do but was not going to sleep any time soon. I was sorting through her DVD collection searching for films I had not seen before and luckily enough stumbled onto this film. I had never heard of it and though this might sound crazy I felt drawn to the film. I mean I really loved the cover and I really love a lot of Asian themed films and so I read the brief description on the back of the case and decided it sounded decent enough to pass the time. Since it had Claire Danes who I love in every movie she has been in except maybe Romeo  Juliet which I had not seen at the time I decided it would be entertaining. Giving this movie a chance was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life and I am not exaggerating. It is simply perfect flawless in my opinion in every way possible and fully deserves any positive recognition it receives plus all the other recognition it should have received and should be receiving now.First of all it is executed so much better than any other film I have ever seen and was so beautifully crafted and put together with perfect performances and poignancy that it makes my head spin. I was so entranced in the story and I am amazed at how perfect I believe this movie to be. It is sheer brilliance from beginning to end. It has the perfect atmosphere of intensity and brilliance that keeps me entranced in it from the getgo. The performances are perfect. Claire Danes does wonderfully as Alice and her splendid portrayal was perfect with enough sincerity and an amazing climax scene that goes down as my favorite scene in cinema history. Kate Beckinsale is perfect and her character while annoying some reviewers did not annoy me one bit. Bill Pullman is perfect and I have never really cared for him at all. Jacqueline Kim is perfect. Lou Diamond Phillips is perfect. I could list the entire cast but I am sure you get the point I am trying to prove by now.It has an excellent plot with authenticity and pain rending the viewer helpless to submit to every kind of emotion they intend you to submit to. I love how it unfolds them wanting to have a more memorable vacation by going somewhere exotic meeting and becoming infatuated with Nick Parks or Skip and then how they are thrown in jail for heroin that neither of them claims to know how it got into their luggage and their lives are slowly turned upside down on a vacation that was supposed to be their last great time together. It is so achingly beautiful. I love the whole backstory at the beginning and it immediately clicks with me and I know these two girls' lives and traits which is why I care for them so much throughout the entire remainder of the film. It inspires sympathy in the utmost manner for them. Nothing is superficial or played out about it because the way it is told is like everything is fresh and new to our senses. It is grotesque without being violent it is heartbreaking without being depressing and all the material you think is irrelevant is revealed as being important pieces of the puzzle little by little.All the troubles and faults that go on in the prison make me pull my hair out and grit my teeth. The cruel inmate that causes Alice to be punished the failed escape the cockroach in Darlene's ear. Those poor girls I wish I could help them. It is not as violent as it could be but it did not need to be to berelevant. I know this is sometimes compared to A Midnight Express and Return to Paradise and a few other drugsmuggling in foreign regions films but I can assure you in my honest opinion none compare to the brilliant execution and poignancy of this magnificent work of art. The soundtrack is even perfect as well. I love Rock the Casbah Silence Damaged Party and then Deliver Me is positively beautiful and a perfect song choice to an absolutely wonderful ending which brings me to my next appraise. I am baffled by the movies last minutes. The best climaxending in cinematic history and the most effective in my honest opinion. The movie's ending made me cry my eyes out but the song just added on to the tears. There is the cliffhanger that just makes this movie even more amazing. You never know if Alice did it or if she didn't you just know she did what she had to do set her friend free in the end and after all that's all the matters is it not? All of this does not even begin to explain how perfect I think it is. It is extremely underrated not winning one award and is hardly conversed about in today's film society and a hidden gem for anyone who has seen it and loved it. It is a beautiful perfect movie with a powerful message and incredible entertainment value. It has been my favorite movie for awhile now and I believe that I might not find another movie that I love as much as it anytime soon.I know my comment may be a little cheesy but I mean every word... Two thumbs way up!".

	schema:headline " American Teenagers In A Foreign Land";
	schema:reviewBody "Brokedown Palace is a drama starring Claire Danes Kate Beckinsale and Bill Pullman. The story deals with two American friends imprisoned in Thailand for drug smuggling. It presents a critical view of the Thai legal system.Most scenes were filmed in the Philippines and some panoramas and views were filmed in Bangkok.It was directed by Jonathan Kaplan.Two carefree Americans embark on an overseas vacation that soon becomes a nightmare. Alice is a headstrong teenager who wants to do something different to celebrate her high school graduation so she persuades her more reserved best friend Darlene to join her on a trip to Bangkok. While enjoying sun and scenery Alice and Darlene meet Nick Parks a charming Australian who shows them the sights and sweettalks Darlene into a romantic assignation which is something of a surprise to her bolder friend Alice. Nick then suggests that they join him on a side trip to Hong Kong but they soon discover that Nick's interest has been neither friendly nor romantic he has hidden a large amount of heroin in their luggage and is using them as drug runners without their knowledge. When the heroin is found by customs officials Alice and Darlene are quickly tried and sentenced to 33 years in a hideous prison known to inmates as BrokeDown Palace. Their plight comes to the attention of Yankee Hank a renegade American attorney in Asia but while Hank struggles with the court system to get Alice and Darlene released they must deal with the living hell of life behind bars and their own doubts about each other. The main lessons of this film are the following friendship is powerful don't trust strangers nice girls shouldn't drink and sleep around. The film's bleakest moments in the jail aren't all that bad and in this respect Brokedown Palace has nothing on the intensity of films such as Midnight Express or even Return to Paradise. Yet Danes and Beckinsale prove they are strong actresses and their characters' friendship is suitably complex and believable. This is a tale of selfdiscovery and the ultimate sacrifice for a friend.It could have been compelling but unfortunately Danes and Beckinsale struggle to bring some conviction to a story sorely in need of it.".

	schema:headline " A film about the power of friendship.";
	schema:reviewBody "We all have friends.  Some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with people that you can say are like your brother or sister.  Alice  Danes and Darlene  Beckinsale  are like that.  You can see that from the beginning.  They graduated together they go to parties together and they decide to go to Bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to Hawaii.  They also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster.  The rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope.  It also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone.Brokedown Palace is a very good film it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that I want to talk about.  But first I want to say what is good about the film.  And for starters the acting is top notch and you can look no further than the two leads.  Danes and Beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have.  Alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges but she seems more fun than Darlene.  But sometimes that fun can get her into trouble.  Darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of Alice's.  Bill Pullman is adequate as the American lawyer living in Thailand.  The film is photographed very well also.  The inside of the prison while not the same as Shawshank or Natural Born Killers or Return To Paradice but it does show the necessary  but underdone hopelessness of the situation that they are in.  Johnathin Kaplan's direction is quite good as well.  We see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day.  Brokedown Palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive.  The other thing that I had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film.  It heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection.  The song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison.  You can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life.

I won't say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you'll know what I am talking about.  Also I didn't really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad.  It looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic.  But I didn't get that here.Overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question  How far would you go for a friend?   That is a tough question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until put into the same situation. Let's just hope that it never comes down to that.".

	onyx:emotionText "We all have friends.  Some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with people that you can say are like your brother or sister.  Alice  Danes and Darlene  Beckinsale  are like that.  You can see that from the beginning.  They graduated together they go to parties together and they decide to go to Bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to Hawaii.  They also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster.  The rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope.  It also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone.Brokedown Palace is a very good film it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that I want to talk about.  But first I want to say what is good about the film.  And for starters the acting is top notch and you can look no further than the two leads.  Danes and Beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have.  Alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges but she seems more fun than Darlene.  But sometimes that fun can get her into trouble.  Darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of Alice's.  Bill Pullman is adequate as the American lawyer living in Thailand.  The film is photographed very well also.  The inside of the prison while not the same as Shawshank or Natural Born Killers or Return To Paradice but it does show the necessary  but underdone hopelessness of the situation that they are in.  Johnathin Kaplan's direction is quite good as well.  We see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day.  Brokedown Palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive.  The other thing that I had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film.  It heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection.  The song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison.  You can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life.  And it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do.  We have it easy compared to some country's and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject.

I excepted to cry my heart out 'cause I'm sucker for hot girls in need just read my review of 'the stalking of Laurie Show'. Some moist escaped my eyes but it were hardly buckets filled with tears. Why? Not because the two heroines weren't utterly adoring and helpless not because the movie wasn't heartbreaking at the sight of these two kids in the prime of their live locked up in almost inhuman conditions. Why then? Why did I not cry? I wanted to cry! When I rent a movie like this I except to be moved to sob like there's no tomorrow to feel miserable and like it. This movie was simply too short to do this. It was just like the script was reduced to the main plot elements and while doing this the psychological aspect was thrown aside. Clare Danes and Kate Beckinsale did an excellent job portraying the emotions of the two friends but this movie just screamed for more footage of these girls in their depressing and oppressing surroundings. The mental journey is missing here for some reason. You only get to see the key moments of it which are very touching I admit probably because of bad editing. Sometimes I felt these girls were walking around in a postcard. The relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention. What's up with the relationships between the girls and the parents especially between Alice and her dad? You catch a glimpse of it but the film doesn't quite offer the whole picture sadly enough.Nonetheless this was a great movie and at the end I even had to bite my lip a bit. But I guess this has more to do with the acting skills and the looks of the actresses and the music then with the merit of the director. To be honest I hardly knew who Kate Beckinsale was before I watched this movie again. Now I am a fan! Great movie as long as you don't expect it to be classic cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the film Brokedown Palace directed by Jonathan Kaplan two best friends Alice Claire Danes and Darlene Kate Beckinsale decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to Hawaii but hear that Bangkok Thailand is much more fun. They switched plans and decided to go to Thailand without telling their parents the change of plans. While they were in Thailand Alice and Darlene met a really handsome guy named Nick Parks Daniel Lapaine. He tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to Hong Kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in Hong Kong. They accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs. They were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison. I think Kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever. Also a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face. Those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever. Things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made. Sometimes life is not fair that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made.This movie has a great setting it was filmed mostly in Bangkok Thailand. This film also has great music a few of my favorite songs are 'Silence' by Delerium 'Damaged' by Plumb 'Deliver me' by Sarah Bightman and 'Party's just begun' by Nelly Furtado. I went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film. These girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly a mistake that anyone could make therefore this film is good for any audience. It makes no difference young or old  we all are human and subject to mistakes. Even though I did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of who really smuggled the drugs?  I would definitely give this film two thumbs up.".

The plot has so many holes you could drive a mule train through it.  There are only three things worth seeing in this movie 1. A good shot of the Golden Palace very impressive 2.

The flaws are minute and I recommend the film which seems buried sadly forever to rare TV showings. I for one want the film for my collection a collection of only 10 rated films. Watch it you will be very touched.";

	schema:reviewBody "!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!One of the main criticisms from people who dislike BROKEDOWN PALACE is the character motivation . Since I dislike this movie I couldn't help but notice the shallow characterisation and perhaps the characterisation and my dislike of the movie are linked ? A couple of young American women Alice and Darlene lie to their parents that they're off to Hawaii when in fact they're going to Thailand . it's never actually explained why they feel the need to lie since from what little we see of their family leads us to believe they get on well with their parents . It should also be pointed out that both Alice and Darlene are obviously old enough to look after themselves so why lie ? there's also another problem later on with the characters of Alice and Darlene later on where they sneak into a plush hotel and order drinks on someone else's tab . This sets up a chain of events that leads to the two girls being convicted of supplying heroin . Now I'm saying they deserved what they got but ask yourself this  If you were staying at an expensive hotel and someone was ordering expensive cocktails on your hotel bill what would your reaction be ? Would you be sympathetic ? Neither would I and the more you think about it the more you come to the conclusion that Alice and Darlene have brought their problems on their selves This actually sums up the problem with BROKEDOWN PALACE  you never feel any great empathy let alone sympathy for Alice and Darlene . They come across as being fairly dumb . They never think of checking their bags before they go to the airport because if they had they might have noticed a couple of kilos of smack in their luggage . One of them happily signs a sheet of paper even though it's written in Thai and later on they bribe a guard so they can escape . Being completely dumb neither girl understands that escaping from prison and escaping from a country are two entirely different things  they're still wearing a prison uniform  have no false passports and no money so how are they going to get back to America ? Obviously America has a surplus of bimbos . If you think that's daft wait till you see Alice at the end At the risk of sounding sexist I doubt if BROKEDOWN PALACE was made to be anything more than a chick flick involving prison with the theme being how far would you go to save your best friend and I doubt if it will appeal much outside of the market it was intended for".

The film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether or which of the girls was involved and Bill Pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer. Jacqueline Kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind magnanimous wife Yon who is also an attorney. I wish the girls had been abused more in the prison as another commenter has suggested as I've heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal. Where this film grabs me however is its ending. Alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that Darlene can be pardoned and we the viewers realize that they are both innocent. Any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me and this wellacted drama is certainly deserving.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brokedown Palace 1999Who wouldn't have some curiosity and tension about two pretty young women played by pretty young actresses anyway trapped in a Thai prison system for drug smuggling? But boy is this a clunky construction for a movie. First of all the women are stupid. They admit to being stupid but they are selfish and frivolous and you really couldn't care less if they went to jail. On the other hand you can picture being in a foreign country and losing track of things a little and getting victimized and so you do after all get involved and hope for justice.There is sometimes a tense progression of increasingly discouraging events and the prison system is a tough place. And the sets and filming are really great. If only the writing was remotely convincing and smart. It's not. Even the direction is painful emphasizing not the facts or some sense of possible realism but an armchair version of what this kind of scenario might mean to two relatively innocent girls is just a little embarrassing. The director Jonathan Kaplan is the same one who missed a huge opportunity with some amazing material filming In Cold Blood and he is understandably most known for television which takes a different kind of sensibility. And it's also very slow taking a few turns or progressions and stretching a two hour movie out of it.It's a tough ride if you take it at face value. And it's a shame because there is a Midnight Express hidden in here somewhere. There are some really gorgeous moments aside from the travelogue stuff and I think Claire Danes at least is a good actress. Just an example of how many elements it takes to align and get a great movie.".

No Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it's plot has been done many times before. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be done again if it is done well and I think this movie had some strong moments. The acting of Claire Danes as already mentioned many times was flawless as was Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performancesPullman's wife the crooked cop skip or trip or whatever his name is. The cinematography was also beautifully filmed there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negativesthree major ones that I found as well.Here is what I didn't like about itthe friendship between the girlsIn fact the girls' own individual personalitieswere not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic. It would not have been improbable to lose interest before then because despite the positives more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much Jumping around without the character and scene development I think would have been appropriate for this type of film. That however is not my major problem. And WARNINGSPOILER ALERT.The ending as mentioned dozens of times already was AWFUL. It was awful in two respects. Firstly even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood I wanted a happy ending! Yes it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this there is a Sense that justice will be served and I did sit through it to see that. I was Genuinely shocked at the ending and It was performed with excellence by all involved but I feel both girls should have got out or barring that at least the cop should have got what was coming to him. I mean nothing happens To the bad guys they all get away with it. Very disturbing.Also I do not understand the ambiguity of the ending. I understand endings that are inspired to make one think but this was not a mystery or Clue type movie we were watching and I would have liked to know something about what actually happenedwho was guilty etc with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since I somehow doubt there will be a sequel I did not want to be kept guessing.Still there was a lot to like about this movie and the acting is definitely at the top of the listI would rate this a 7.5 and say it is definitely worth a look.".

I was once again intrigued by a lot of it but this time certain things bothered me.Two young Americans Alice Marano and Darlene Davis are longterm best friends. After graduating from high school they plan to go on vacation in Hawaii before going to college. However when they are convinced by peers that Thailand is a better choice they decide to go there instead but without informing their parents! While in Thailand they soon meet a young Australian man who introduces himself as Nick Parks. They become friends and Nick convinces Alice and Darlene to fly to Hong Kong. As the two lifelong friends wait in line for their flight they are in for a shock as they are suddenly arrested! It turns out that heroin has been found in their luggage which they both claim they did not put in there and in this country being found guilty of drug smuggling leads to very long prison sentences! Do they have any chance of getting out or are they doomed to spend the next several decades in a Thailand prison?! What are the problems with Brokedown Palace? Well first of all it starts out rather dull. For the most part prior to the arrest I did not see too many merits in the film. I did feel tension at times during this part of the film but that was just because I knew what was going to happen. I also found Claire Danes' narration as Alice to be rather poor and I have noticed quite a bit of praise for the acting not a lot of criticism but I myself was not too impressed with it at least not from the two lead actresses Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale so I'm a bit confused. Maybe I'm thinking too much of the script which I'm not surprised to find a lot of criticism for andor I just don't like the two main characters who don't seem too bright. I must confess I am not an expert on Thailand so I don't know how accurately Brokedown Palace depicts the country and if I were to go there at some point it could negatively change my view on this film.Since I was impressed with quite a few parts of this drama I can't give it any less than a 610. The film could also remind people in first world countries of the harsh penalties for crimes in countries like Thailand so I guess I'll give it credit for that as well. However 6 is not THAT high a rating and because of all the problems I found in the film it wouldn't feel right to give it a rating any higher than that. In my opinion Brokedown Palace is not that bad though those who are more enlightened on the subject matter of the film may disagree but if it wasn't for certain significant problems I think it would have had a lot more potential.".

	schema:reviewBody "The three families this story entwines are Broken in different ways all live at the end of a culdesac a nearby scrapyard features in many shots where the crushing mangling and pounding of cars in many ways reflects their lives. The central character is the insulin dependant twelve Year old 'skunk' played by Eloise Laurence. She lives with her father Archie the ever reliable Tim Roth older brother Jed and their live in housekeeper Kasia. Rory Kinnear is Bob the separated father of three near feral girls who run riot both at school and at home. When Bob finds a condom that one of the girls has been innocently playing with he jumps to the wrong conclusion. Which culminates in him giving a beating to Rick the backward son of Mr and Mrs Buckley. This is witnessed by Skunk and kickstarts an ultimately fatal chain of events. Running parallel with the story of these three families there is the on off relationship between housekeeper Kasia and schoolteacher Mike Cillian Murphy. Plus the arrival of a traveller child Dillon who befriends Skunk.If you enjoy Brit flicks in the mould of Mike Leigh or Shane Meadows this is a must see. Sparking on themes of love loss friendship and violence this is a confident and unfussy directorial debut by Rufus Norris comfortably adapting to celluloid from the theatre. The way the story and characters interweave never feels contrived. The child actors are superb especially Martha Bryant as the youngest of the feral siblings who is outstanding. As is Laurence as Skunk who also sings on a couple of the Damon Albarn songs on the soundtrack. The strange but ever reliable sign of a good movie is that amongst the dross at my local Cineworld this is only on show for one week go figure. Cineworld get your ten screen act together please and support great British movies of this ilk. Films as good as this are few and far between throughout the year so get on the bus to hell with the expense treat yourself to a taxi but get to the big screen and watch this little gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "To borrow a line from my review of last year's heartbreaking film The Hunt Jagten sometimes children lie. Sometimes they are simple instinctive lies sometimes they are calculated as an easy escape from a truth that may have dark consequences and sometimes lives are broken as a result.When 11year old Skunk Eloise Laurence in her film debut witnesses a swift but brutal attack in the quiet avenue where she lives a series of violent events both physical and emotional ensues that has a devastating impact on three families.The three families each dysfunctional in their own ways would not ordinarily have anything in common and would not be drawn to one another but we see them confined in a small culdesac like trapped wild animals thrown into the same cage and each missing some of the essentials for an equanimous life. In a strange way this could be a suburban take on Life of Pi with a young girl trying to make sense of a mad world. The tragedy is circumstance but that's no excuse for the way some of the neighbours enact their lives escalating lies and compounding mistakes.But though all sounds bleak Broken is occasionally beautiful frequently touching and often funny and again it is all these things because it is so real. Watching Skunk and her brother Jed Bill Milner Will from Son of Rambow wrestling clipping clothes pegs to each other and hanging out in their camp brings back memories of childhood when the world seemed against us but there was always an escape to a bright fantasy existence.The humour comes not from cheesy asides or selfconscious jokes but from delightfully extraneous happenings on the periphery the crashing descent of a car in a breakers yard a boy dancing alone in a car park and a pair of twins with poo in a slingshot That director Rufus Norris another debut has paid such care to the incidentals makes Broken a more complete film.His choice of music is fantastically inelegant. Forget the whimsy of Rachel Portman Chocolat or the rousing scores of John Williams do you really need me to tell you? what carries Broken is close to the demo tune on a 1980s Cassio keyboard with Rolf Harris twanging along on a Jew's harp. And if that isn't sufficient to lighten the mood as characters on the screen struggle to make sense of the dark craziness of life along pops a song to celebrate the bizarre madness of it and we are permitted to laugh as the singer intones 'One day when I'm really old and my hair falls out I'll stick it back with the spoon of the marmalade that you made' It's rare that I mention the editing but Victoria Boydell has sensitively cut a story to match the patterns of our minds. Occasionally we jump forwards by minutes as if reading an exciting novel our eyes sprinting ahead until our brain slows us down then seamlessly we step back to see in everything fully and in order.Norris has cast Broken faultlessly. The star name upon which it's sold is Tim Roth as Archie Skunk's dad a single parent who is the calm reasonable father in the middle of a minor battlefield. It's unfathomable watching him here that he isn't a bigger star. Archie is clearly a man with great pressure in an unenviable situation but he doesn't simply make the best of it he endeavours to make it the best it can be. It is a wonderful understated performance that I suspect few will see.Laurence is a revelation and the emotional fullness with which she inhabits Skunk allows us to root for her and silently admonish her because she could easily be the girl next door.There isn't a poor performance in Broken only characters you care for and those from whom you'd run a mile. Rory Kinnear son of Roy as Bob gives us a man who is on the face of it the neighbor from hell with a trio of daughters to match but he's no twodimensional villain rather a damaged man with his own daemons he is unable to cope with. In contrast Kasia Zana Marjanovich the friend who lives with Archie as a cross between friend auntie and surrogate mother brings a gentle caring irreverence in the midst of the turmoil but she too has her 'edge.' Robert Emms so often an invisible supporting actor is breathdrawingly good as the mentally ill victimized Rick who struggles to cope with the various warzones into which he is cast. He is the hatefigure of Bob and his daughters the cause of weariness and frustration in his parents superb turns from Dennis Lawson  Clare Burt and more than anything the terrifying confusion in his mind. His character evolution is superb and our own feelings towards him are as confused as his own.Once the credits had rolled I sat in silence and reflected on how life runs away from us and we are subject to its whims. Sometimes we emerge the beneficiaries sometimes the victims. Perhaps this is simple karma perhaps it is fatalism. Or maybe everything is random or even the result of misunderstandings and the inability of mere humans to communicate their feelings openly simply and honestly.Broken asks the questions but leaves us to draw our own conclusions.Sometimes 'broken' may be repaired.

This film really doesn't hold back some of the scenes and subjects will be uncomfortable for some viewers. I really didn't like the Oswald family but the story really wouldn't have worked without them.I really liked how parts of this film where done we would see something happen unexpectedly and then it would flashback to show the build up to it from a different perspective. The story linked together really well. It is very engaging although some parts are unrealistic.The acting in this film was nothing short of superb from everyone. There was a lot of familiar faces but the star of the show has to be Eloise Laurence who made her acting debut in the lead role as Skunk.It's a shame this film probably won't get the recognition it deserves due to it being relatively unheard of.

It is a British product BBC and seems to have had a minimal response in the theaters. Now more available to the public hopefully this brilliant work will attract enough attention to place it in the categories for many awards it so justly deserves. But more important it may expose many people to the tragedies that surround us and are too often unnoticed or misunderstood.In North London there are three families whose houses form a culdesac Archie Tim Roth never better is a single father whose wife left him to raise 11 year old insulin dependent adventuresome tomboy Skunk Eloise Laurence and her brother Jed Bill Milner and their housekeeper Kasia Zana Marjanovic The Oswalds  Bob Rory Kinnear is an out of control easily enraged father of three loose and trashy daughters Susan Rosalie Kosky Saskia Faye Daveney and Sunrise Martha Bryant and the Buckleys  Mr. and Mrs. Buckley Denis Lawson and Clare Burt and their severely mentally challenged son Rick Robert Emms. Bob Oswald finds a condom that one of his daughters had been exploring jumps to the conclusion that Rick has raped his daughter and beats Rick mercilessly  a sight Skunk witnesses. This cruel error is the first play in the downward spiral of this profoundly sad tale of how these three families interact. There are a few subplots  Kasia is dating a local school teacher Mike Cillian Murphy as well as trying to convince Archie to marry her Skunk is befriended and has her first rocky encounter with a boy named Dillon George Sargeant and they find an empty trailer house by the nearby junkyard where massive machines toss old cars around like unwanted bugs one of the Oswald girl's secret pregnancy ends badly Rick Buckley is blamed for every odd happening and is institutionalized Skunk's friendship with Rick involves her in tragic consequences and more. Every member of each family is broken in some way and the manner in which these pieces of shattered lives influence each other makes for some of the most profoundly moving scenes and themes ever filmed.The story is based on the novel by Daniel Clay adapted for the screen by Mark O'Rowe and Rufus Norris makes his impressive directing debut. The entire cast is first class  this is the first film experience for Eloise Laurence and she is stunning as are Tim Roth and Cillian Murphy and the rest. For this viewer this is one of the finest movies of the past year a film so challenging and exquisitely crafted that it should be seen by everyone. Highly Recommended.".

I know that this movie was done on a budget but the movie is top class and its a shame that a lot of people will miss this film because it isn't a major blockbuster. great Movie!RoundUp If anyone reads my reviews please rent this movie because you won't be disappointed. The director cleverly gives you the shock value right from the beginning and then he shows different situations from all of the 3 families points of view which was put together extremely well. The other thing that surprised me was that it really isn't predictable and its one of those movies where it takes you some time to get out of that zone once the film has finished. I'm glad that the director was able to get some quality actors to portray his view of the script because of the budget. A must watch!I recommend this movie to people who like there emotional dramas about the relationship between 3 individual families. 810".

The subject treated in this movie may not be something new for the viewers but what I am certain of is that director Ruffus Norris really has a great vision and an amazing ability to capture the audience's complete attention every single second of the film allowing the movie to drive them. You'll definitely enjoy watching this movie and I assure you it will be quite an experience. Few movies have succeeded in capturing me to the last frame but Broken is one of them again a courtesy of the amazing cinema of England. The movie is based on the concept of causes and consequences that lead to certain actions and results that may be good or bad depending on the situation. It is set in a small neighborhood where the stories of the characters living there intertwine in a beautiful way. It is a story about the loss of innocence childhood unfortunate events and people trying to do good and forced to do bad.Enough said this film is definitely a mustwatch this year.".

From then one things go from bad to worse amongst the neighbourhood and her own family.This film is acting debut of Eloise Laurence who plays Skunk she is faultless. She keeps Skunks emotions right on the edge of her sleeves which makes her performance more real. When you look at her you can't help but smile even when it's a serious scene she is just so cute and so amazingly talented. I hope to see her more in the future.Tim Roth plays Skunk's dad Archie. As always Tim is amazing he really brings all the emotions a father would feel towards his daughter and puts it into his performance and let's face it who wouldn't want Tim Roth as their onscreen father? Cillian Murphy plays Mike the boyfriend of their au pair Kasia he also becomes Skunk's teacher. Murphy plays Mike as the most loyaldevoted boyfriend who anyone would want Which makes him a really likable character and even comes to Skunk's rescue which I think any girl would want. You really feel for him when things turn upside down on him and want to reach out a give him a hug. Plus he keeps is Irish accent for this one! 'Broken' is a film full of emotions be them happy sad anger or love. This film is an emotional rollercoaster ride with some brilliant actors and some wonderful singing from the lead lady herself.".

	schema:headline " Bleak view of violent broken North Londoners and the culture";
	schema:reviewBody "Rufus Norris's Broken is like the early Ken Loach social dramas ramped up to the breaking point. Where British social realism centered on the working class Broken examines three families in an upper middle class close. The characters live in spacious wellappointed houses in a quiet North London neighborhood. So class is not an issue here. Nor is economics. Nor even is race as the classroom easily accommodates some black children and an aerial view shows a black kid practicing his dance moves in the school parking lot  that even the sensitive teacher Mike Kiernan Cilliam Murphy is too selfobserved to notice. Instead of those familiar problems here the issue is  as you may or may not have inferred from the title  breakage.The people are broken. Bob Oswald Rory Kinnear unrecognizable is explosively violent especially in defense of his equally fragilebrutish three daughters. Teacher Mike can teach courage but can't marshall his own to commit to his love Kasia Zena Marjanovic until it's too late. The most literally broken character is Rick Robert Emms who suffered brain damage from a childhood drowning and here moves from being beaten by Oswald into killing his own helplessly wellmeaning parents. His mother's welcome home cake may not be broken but it has collapsed. The families are broken. Solicitor Archie Tim Roth lost his wife to an accountant ! and struggles to raise his daughter Skunk Eloise Lawrence and son Jed Bill Milner. Oswald's wife died leaving him to do the ironing and to express his paternal manhood by beating up any alleged threats to his girls. Though united in love and caring even Rick's parents quarrel loudly over how best to handle him. When Kasia loses patience with her fianc Mike she turns to Archie but her switch from nanny to possible stepmother rouses Skunk to feeling abandoned even by her father Because she'll leave us the way she left Mike. Like Mum left us. Like everyone does. Oswald loses one daughter Archie almost loses his and the Buckleys lose their son in the most dramatic form of family destruction. At the root of the breakage lies a barely repressed violence. Oswald explodes twice savagely beating first Rick then Mike  in trying to be a good father. But down the spectrum of violence Rick's mother Clare Burt tries to physically keep Rick from his room leading to her death. Even the civilized Archie almost loses control in the police station out of his concern for his missing diabetic daughter. He has to be restrained by his son. The gentle teacher Mike smashes a chair when he owes his freedom to his lost girl's lover. Indeed Broken is a reflection of a broken nation a shattered culture. There are no community norms any more no accepted guidance for the children no community even among the families enjoying the closeness of their close. Their father jailed the girls throw a wild party. The characters may as well be hard scrabble screamers in the council flats. Perhaps the film's central metaphor is the automobile junkyard where impersonal giant jaws shuffle the wrecks from place to place. There Skunk finds refuge in an abandoned van.Skunk provides the film's one optimistic note and it's enough to balance all the despair. Like the lawyer's daughter Scout in To Kill A Mockingbird Skunk comes of age learning decency from her dad in an indecent violent dishonest world. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.".

The message I got was that one brutal man creates a vortex of destruction that hurts everybody around him. The father of the three girls is absolutely the source of all the grief. The fact that his girls are terrified of him leads one of them to make a false accusation. His reaction is not to find out the truth because you know teenage girls are not the most reliable witnesses. Instead he launches a savage attack on an innocent  and helpless  man which sets in motion a chain of events leading eventually to great tragedy. This is a guy who doesn't bother much with the truth just violently attacks people  twice  on the word of his highly unreliable and conniving daughters. All the other characters have their issues sure but they attempt to deal with them in a civilized reasonable way. It's a dysfunctional criminal and violent family that is the villain here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eloise Laurence in her motion picture debut is really terrific as Skunk aka Emily Cunningham in this extremely dark British drama. Tim Roth gives his usual very solid performance as Skunk's father Archie a lawyer who is left to raise Skunk and her brother Jed Bill Milner after Archie's wife has run off with an accountant. They're aided by a livein nanny Kosia ably portrayed by Zana Marjanovic.Skunk is an 11 year old girl who must face numerous challenges in addition to the loss of her mother. She's a Type 1 diabetic who must take daily injections and constantly monitor her blood sugar levels. She also has to contend with a new school and the bullying therein a crush on her teacher Mr. Kiernan played by the fine actor Cillian Murphy as well as a first boyfriend Dillon George Sargeant and a first real kiss. However even more scary and potentially more dangerous are her neighbors. There's the rageful and violent neighbor Bob Oswald believably portrayed by Rory Kinnear who along with his three out of control daughters are causing havoc in the neighborhood. There's also the seriously mentally disturbed Rick Robert Emms living across the street with his doting mother and overwhelmed father. All of these families and characters will eventually come together in brutally stark ways. The film does little to shield the viewer from very bleak and difficult scenes.Thank goodness for the movie's powerful ending or I may just have felt the whole film was just too depressing and unflinching for me.All in all Eloise Laurence's riveting presence on screen was I think the true heart of the film. Most likely this film is not for everyone with its' heavy themes but with its' very strong ending I was glad I stayed with it.The film was directed by Rufus Norris an accomplished stage director but making his film debut here. It was written by Mark O'Rowe Boy A based on the novel by Daniel Clay.".

It's a highdrama movie nothing less. That it is well made and well acted is a bonus. And the fact it manages to touch on issues of intolerance and misunderstanding in our current world is valuable.

	schema:headline " A gripping social drama and a depressing situation report with a brilliant performance of Eloise Laurence";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't be scared. I just want your goodness.Broken. I'm not sure yet what covers this title. Is it the broken relationships and mutual relations between the families living in this culdesac. Is it about the fragile health of Skunk or the fragile state of mind of Rick. Or is it about the few broken noses that the hotheaded neighbor Bob hands out. From the first minute in this sad story I was taken on a trip through several petty depressive states. Yes you won't have happy feelings after watching this movie. However the end is a godsend and a gorgeous display of hope.Every household has his cross to bear. In this dead end street they had endofseason sales of heavy crosses. Let us hope that this is not a matter of course in most districts. First there's Skunk whose mother left for some accountant and her family. She lives with her father Archie Superb acting by Tim Rothher brother and their housekeeper under one roof . The housekeeper has an onoff relationship with a teacher who is full of doubts about the future of their relationship. Skunk also has diabetes that she follows meticulously. Opposite lives the Buckley family. An older couple with the mentally disabled son Rick. A friendly guy who as you'll notice later has a dark incalculable side. And then there is the aggressive and violent Mr. Oswald and his three teenage daughters. Bob Oswald's wife is deceased and the education of his three daughters is his greatest concern . However the morbid concern about the welfare of his daughters is the cause of the improper conduct of the 3 annoying buggers.Essentially these three families have nothing in common and they show no affinity for each other except Skunk vs. Rick and yet their life paths will be intertwined in a drastic way which will lead to the resulting conflicts. The whole situation escalates because of one simple lie. A lie to cover up the truth and to prevent facing some measures. A lie that has disastrous consequences and brings the relationships even more to falter. Skunk her cheerful and carefree life collapses after witnessing an aggressive assault on the introvert and unworldly Rick. It's the beginning of a spiral of sequential disturbing events.Broken is a gripping social drama and a depressing situation report. This shows once again that British dramas can be of a high level. The debut of Eloise Laurence as the vulnerable Skunk doesn't go unnoticed. A beautiful rendition that testifies a youthful spontaneity and empathy. The range of emotions that she has to show is not obvious  and yet she knows how to interpret it. I 'm not easily impressed by certain actors  but this was a brilliant performance .Tim Roth is a respected actor and known from the TV series Lie to Me. However I'm not a avid fan of TV shows . But his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs are well known to me. Roth has a kind of soothing calm charisma. Sometimes he reminds me of a light version of James Bond with identical expressions like Steve Carell. That confident look and cool probing observation. An icy dispassionate attitude until that moment at the hospital sitting next to Skunk's bed and telling his dream again in an emotional way. Masterfully portrayed.I couldn't really find any faults when it's about the rest of the cast. Beautiful renditions piece by piece. The three pubescent teenage girls were playing in such a convincing way that you would consider to step up to those three brutal little twerps and put them in their place. Robert Emms should also be mentioned for his irresistible and not obvious rendition of Rick the mentally handicapped neighbor. The impressive pity arousing beginning the tormented and helpless attitude during his psychiatric confinement and the destructive frenzy at the end. All these aspects are brilliantly handled by him.Filmic it also looks worked out nicely by Rufus Norris. The sometimes straightforward images with that typical British tone and style that you can find in acclaimed British series like EastEnders. The recurring flashbacks and dreamlike visions of the future are mixed with the daily harsh reality. Ultimately the core of the film is scarier than any slasher or horror film. An impressive social story with a theatrical and thank goodness a positive ending.More reviews at httpopinionasamoviefreak.blogspot.be".

	schema:headline " Amazingly heartfelt and riveting to watch!";
	schema:reviewBody "The British independent film Broken broke through in the UK in 2012 with a quite a splash winning a number of awards. The film however has sort of flown under the radar as it wasn't released in the US until last Summer by Film Movement. Its the dramatic coming of age story of an 11 year old girl affectionately named Skunk. She is played by first time actor Eloise Laurence who gives a remarkably real and thoughtful performance. This is also the first feature film for director Rufus Norris.Skunk lives within a culdesac in suburban London with her Dad Archie played by Tim Roth and older brother Jed. Her mother ran off with another man years back. They have a live in nanny Kasia who serves as a sort of mother or big sister figure. Cillian Murphy also puts forth a strong performance as Mike Kasia's boyfriend and Skunk's crush. The stories of the three families within the culdesac are all compelling and well integrated into Skunk's world. We open with Skunk talking to Rick an older friend but mentally unstable neighbor who out of nowhere get a savage beating from Mr. Oswald the fiery father of a trio of foul mouthed daughters who are also without a mother.Adding to the many difficulties of adolescence Skunk also has diabetes. She could be bitter and angry about her situation but is very resilient and strong. She is adventurous inquisitive and full of wonder where as the girls next door are petty vile and just plain unpleasant. The two families are dealing with similar issue in very different ways. While the third family Rick's Family tries to keep to themselves and protect there son from the world. Rick is a volatile man child. He has a gentle and sweet exterior that fights with his inner rage and turmoil. After becoming to much of a handful for his parents to deal with he is put up in a hospital. Skunk see the good in him the longing to be normal and accepted. The final 30 minutes will keep you on the edge of your seat with a an intensity that is hard to find. I know that sound a little clichd but the filmmakers took such care in developing the story and building its characters that the ending just works on every level. You won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "An incredibly well acted drama with a lot of warmth and heart. Broken is a British realism at its best it has been crafted so well and with such sensitivity that the audience cannot help but be touched.The 11yearold Skunk Eloise Laurence lives in a seemingly normal neighborhood in a British suburb. A mentally retarded teenager Rick Robert Emms lives with his parents in the neighborhood. Also nearby lives a shorttempered widowed father Mr. Oswald Rory Kinnear with his three daughters. Skunk lives with her father Archie Tim Roth and her brother Jed Bill Milner and housekeeper Kasia Zana Marjanovic  her mother ran off years ago with another man. Everything is as usual until one day at the beginning of summer vacation the eldest daughter of Oswald's alleged that Rick they she has been raped by him. Mr. Oswald beats defenseless Rick viciously. The story is based around documents but above all their consequences. Parallelly narrated the various family fates with Skunk as a kind of common thread among them and what was behind the attack and the implications then get up slowly unraveling.The acclaimed theater director Rufus Norris makes his film debut with Broken and that he does! He has an amazing eye for detail which is emphasized by the camera revealing closeups which incidentally in Rob Hardy's hands all the way he does a great job. The cinematography is warm almost shimmering but goes even so believable together with the barren suburbs and the environment in which the film is set. It is also incredibly edited. Amid the touching and poignant story it gets spectators to keep the spirit of anticipation.Towards the end it unfortunately becomes somewhat of a hurry there is much that has a place and everything should not the space it deserves. I would have liked to rise against and also the culmination itself had to take more time and indeed the film had at all with the benefit could be half an hour longer.Broken is an absolutely amazing experience with great music and superb actors  from the brilliant young dbutant Eloise Laurence Skunk to the more experienced Tim Roth Daddy and Cillian Murphy teacher Mike everyone does a phenomenal work with such precise and small means and it feels more than visible.".

As Cillian Murphy has said you know you've seen a great film when you can't stop thinking about it. Well I definitely cannot stop thinking about this one. I give it a 10 although I am no film critic. I love this type of filmography and the way everything was portrayed in it. I definitely recommend Broken for anyone who loves touching stories just as much as I do.".

My guess is that everyone knew this was not turning out well because we are told characters' emotional states in baroquely overwritten titles.There are some good bits. The Ball of the Gods in which the miserable wouldbe lovers are reunited is a splendid production number but it comes too late to save the movie. Corinne Barker and Vivienne Osborne as an artist and her occasionally nude model are fairly lively.I came to this film with high expectations and that may have caused me to be harsher in this review than I would have been with an ordinary programmer with lesser talents. However this one is clearly a misfire. A lot of movies can be saved in the editing room. It's clear that they tried. They also failed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made at a time when the cinema was exploring new freedoms in language violence and sex this is a somewhat tough character study which is tame now but had to be pretty gritty then. Sinatra is the title cop a man who bucks the system at times but has an innate core of fairness. When a wealthy homosexual is found slain and mutilated Sinatra and his partner Freeman set out to find the culprit. Meanwhile Sinatra reflects on his troubled marriage to sophisticated but oversexed Remick. He arrests thuggish Musante for the crime and wins a promotion for his trouble but soon after a young woman Bisset comes forth with a case that may be tied into the original one. Sinatra gives an assured and believable performance though it is jarring at first to hear him bandying about terms like penis and queer etc... Remick is attractive and effortlessly sophisticated as his wife who can't seem to keep her knickers on. The supporting cast is made up of great pros who offer a lot. Meeker is a jaded slimy fellow detective. Klugman does well as a family man cop who helps Sinatra crack cases. Duvall is menacing as a hardnosed and prejudicial policeman. Musante is so overthetop it is unbelievable! His interrogation scene is a lesson in extremes and helped sideline his US career for a while. Bisset is lovely as usual but was shoehorned in costumes and all! at the eleventh hour for Sinatra's estranged wife Mia Farrow and the part doesn't fit her as well. She's meant to be a slightly boyish type and that's a tad easier to do on Farrow than it was on Bisset. Bochner is a little too cartooncampy as a vaguely sinister psychiatrist. Though today's audience will likely find many things to pick apart with the story it is nonetheless a fascinating glimpse into what Hollywood's depiction of gays was at the time. One unintentionally funny scene involves a dockside parking lot in which scores of gay men crowd into the back of cargo trucks and snuggle  fully clothed! There's also a groovy trip into a velvety gay bar. The film's chief flaws are its overuse of LENGTHY flashbacks and a hugely distracting habit of having Sinatra and Remick deliver lines directly into the camera a big nono except in comedies or quirky dramas. The flashbacks are necessary in order to flush out the romantic story but they tend to be disjointed and overlong. The issue of speaking to the camera could have been easily solved by just having the actors act opposite each other. This was an experiment that just doesn't work. But the film has a fair share of interesting dialogue situations and visual appeal. One amusing line has a forensic specialist telling Sinatra that the victim was a homosexual. Sinatra looks around the overdone apartment and says Looks like he was a leader! Moss Mabry got quite a workout coming up with outfits for Remick less so for Bisset.".

Sinatra looks around the overdone apartment and says Looks like he was a leader! Moss Mabry got quite a workout coming up with outfits for Remick less so for Bisset.";

	schema:reviewBody "In this film done one year before the Stonewall Riots we get a picture of corruption and homophobia in the NYPD. The Detective should be required viewing for those who want to know about the days before Stonewall when as a people we were subject to routine abuse and violence.A nude man is found murdered in his apartment which usually spells one thing a homicide with gay overtones. Such an occurrence allows the police to be more brutal than usual all in the pursuit of a killer.Back in those days it's hard for people today to believe how bars that catered to gay people were the subject of random police raids usually because the cops didn't get their payoffs. In those days just being in one of those places could constitute an arrest for disorderly conduct and if you touched a member of the same sex and not necessarily in a sexual way that could land you in jail for some time unless you had the money to pay your way out.A man's been killed and suspicion falls on a street punk played by Tony Musante. Frank Sinatra plays a cop who has a specialty in extracting confessions and he does it the hard way without the rubber hose. Miranda was new at the time so they can't beat it out of Musante as per normal. Musante confesses he gets convicted and he gets the still operative electric chair.But right after Musante is killed prominent citizen William Windom jumps to his death from the roof at Aqueduct racetrack. Sinatra is again the detective and connections are established with the two deaths. Sinatra's investigations are opening a lot of doors powerful folks just don't want opened. In this he has the support of Windom's widow Jacqueline Bisset.Sinatra's dealing with some personal problems at the same time. His marriage is breaking up because it turns out his wife Lee Remick is a nymphomaniac. Still it's the story of the two gay related deaths that dominate the film.The Detective boasts one of Frank Sinatra's best latter film performances. Sinatra eschews the hipster mannerisms and delivers a straightforward performance as an honest Serpico like cop in the midst of big town corruption. In the supporting cast I liked Ralph Meeker as a sleazy cop on the take who's quite willing to stop Sinatra any way he can. Also Jack Klugman as Frank's honest sidekick and Renee Taylor as his wife.Forty years after The Detective came out who would have thought in 1968 that we would have something called the Gay Officers Action League among the police fraternal societies in New York and many other metropolitan police forces. Their organized presence in police departments have gone a long way in bringing a sensitivity and awareness for the GLBT community.And this review is dedicated to two out police officers now retired from the job that I knew and worked with in New York City when I was at Crime Victims Board. To Detectives Vanessa Ferro and Mark Caruso who are the finest of the finest in New York and to all the other out gay law enforcement officials.".

A cop with a consciences that turns out to be his own worst enemy. Det. Leland is assigned to a case where the son of a major contributor and political kingmaker in NYC was murdered in what is thought to be a crime of passion. It seems that Teddy Leikman James Inman was killed in his upper EastSide bachelor apartment by his gay roommate the night before and there's an allout manhunt to catch the killer. The police check out places that Leikman usually went to like bars waterfront piers and gyms and come up with someone that was seen hanging out with Teddy most of the time a young street hustler named Felix Tesla Tony Musante. Tracked down to Coney Island in a boardwalk hotel Felix is apprehended and taken into the police station for questioning. A the police station Det. Leland's skillful interrogation of Felix gets him to break down and confess to Leikman's murder. Later convicted of murder and sentenced to death we see Felix strapped down in the electric chair and being executed. Det.Leland is one of the witnesses to Felix's execution. Some time later a young woman Norma Maciver Jacqueline Bisset sees Det. Leland at the police station about the death of her husband Colin William Windon. Colin was killed when he jumped or fell to his death from the roof of the grandstand of a racetrack and his death was determined by he police to be a suicide Norma says that Colin was murdered and wants Det. Leland to reopen the case.Det. Leland agrees to look into Colins death thinking that it would just be a routine matter for him to confirm the original police report and put the thoughts out of Norma's mind that her husband was murdered to rest once in for all. As Det. Leland begins to investigate Colin Maciver's death he starts to realize that he was wrong shockingly wrong about what happened to Colin Macvier! Even worse towards the end of the movie Det. Leland sees that in some way in Colin Macivers suicide he had a connection to his death that goes back to the LiekmanTesla case that he solved some time ago! A good and well rounder story with very good acting especially from Mr.Sinatra makes The Detective stand out today above the scores of crime and police movies made back in the 1960's and even much later. The film really hits the mark with a groundbreaking script about issues like closet homosexually and police and political corruption that just weren't addressed in motion pictures back then. there's also in the film a good supporting cast with future stars that's just too numerous to mention here.Not to be overlooked is Llyod Bochner Dr. Wendell Roberts who in a small but important role reveals the truth about Norma's husbands Colin Maciver's tragic death that leaves Det. Joe Leland almost speechless! The shocking revelations that Dr. Roberts brings out has Let. Leland wonder if being a cop is worth all the dangers risks as well as surprises that the Teddy LeikmanFilex Tesla case eventually brought for him! And most of all it has Det. Leland also wonder if police work is what he's really cut out to do!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ol' Blue Eyes plays a tortured detective burdened with a liberal conscience a cheating wife and a bunch of timeservers and corrupt fascist bullyboys as colleagues in this interesting and complex character study. Joe Leland is an anomaly in his precinct  a career cop from a long line of cops who's read sociology is tolerant of gays and minorities and compassionate towards the social detritus of the permissive society that litters the streets of New York City at the fag end of the 1960s. Inevitably he runs up against complacent hierarchies and corrupt power elites and along the way makes some deep compromises that cause him to question his role as a police officer. Sinatra paints an admirably restrained and nuanced portrait of a man deeply ambivalent about the kind of authority he represents. The film refuses to offer any easy answers to the social sexual and political issues it raises and steers well clear of the cartoon heroics of contemporaneous cop films like Bullit and Coogan's Bluff that also dabbled with the mores of the swinging 60s. The Detective was marketed as titillating and sensational 'adult' fare that exploited the recent demise of the Production Code to offer audiences a new frankness about an America in the throes of the sexual revolution. But beneath these rather opportunistic trappings it's a seriousminded exploration of the meaning of authority and deviance in a postauthoritarian age. While burdened with some now rather outdated representations of homosexuality what plot there is revolves around the homophobic murder of a gay man the film's heart is nevertheless in the right place. It's a kind of liberal precursor to the cryptofascist and authoritarian Dirty Harry. That the heroes of both films reach the same final decision but for very different reasons is fascinating especially given that Sinatra was himself due to play Harry Callahan in the later movie until fate  in the form of a broken wrist  intervened. I guess Joe Leland is Ying to Harry Callahan's Yang. Anyway The Detective is certainly worth watching not least as it represents one of Sinatra's last meaningful dramatic screen roles.".

His wife Lee Remick is practically a nymphomaniac unable to control her sexual appetite while his fellow detectives Ralph Meeker and Robert Duvall are involved in a widespread real estate corruption scandal known as Rainbow. The investigation of the murder takes place after the prime suspect is wrongly executed for the crime and leads into the underground New York homosexual world of the late 60's with some fascinating scenes shot at one of the bars with a few faces that have been seen in other films and a surreal atmosphere. Some have called this gaybashing though it seems more to be a portrayal of the secretive and closeted world of that time. In any event the threat of being outed is an essential part of the story and that element is quite dramatic and well done with William Windom quite believable as the closeted and married gay man at the center of Rainbow. A tough movie of a detective caught up in a weird world of public corruption and personal crisis catch it if you can.".

	schema:headline " Primarily of Interest as a Portrait of 1960s American Homophobia";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1966 novel by Roderick Thorp THE DETECTIVE was among the highest grossing films of both 1968 and one of the most popular of Frank Sinatra's film career. At the time it was considered remarkably honest in its portrait of a nononsense cop who finds himself trapped between a series of compromises and his own sense of integrity. Today however it chiefly notable for its unintentional window onto 1960s homophobia.Joe Leland Frank Sinatra is a third generation New York City police officer who begins the film with two victories in his private life he has wooed and won a remarkably beautiful wife Karen Lee Remick in his professional life he is assigned to a particularly notorious murder case that he quickly solves and which results in a major promotion. But both explode in his face in particularly unsavory ways. Although flawless on the surface Karen is a distinctly disturbed woman who shatters their marriage through a series of compulsive affairs. And although it seems solved the case on which Joe's promotion rests may not be nearly as simple as every one thought at the time.The case involves the brutal murder of a gay man who is found with his head battered in and sexually mutilateda circumstance that leads Joe and his coworkers to prowl 'known homosexual hangouts' such as gyms and the waterfront. In the process the film creates a portrait of the gay community that says considerably less about the gay community than the way in which heterosexual America thought of it at the time. The gay men themselves are improbable being pulled out of group gropes from the back of cargo trucks flexing muscles in tawnycolored gyms frequenting bars notable for satin and velvet and lounging about in silk robes. They come in two basic varieties victim and predator. They are weak and are routinely brutalized by both each other and the police the latter of which positively delight in knocking them around.This is not particularly unusual for films of the 1960s and the 1970s it is much the same portrait presented by such diverse films as ADVISE AND CONSENT and CRUISING. What is unusual is Joe's attitude toward them unlike his coworkers he dislikes seeing them mistreated and prefers to see them and indeed all other suspects accorded a certain basic respect as human beings. It was a very very bold stance for a film to take at the time. Even so it does not counterbalance the portrait itself which is intrinsically demeaning or the story which ultimately pivots on a version of gay panica heterosexual myth used here with a slight spin.The chief grace of the film is the performances of Sinatra and Remick. Today Sinatra is best recalled as a singer but he had some significant acting chops and he proves more than able to over the shortcomings of the script. Lee Remick a muchadmired actress is flawlessly cast as the perfidious wife Karen a woman who superficial qualities conceal an unraveling personality. The supporting cast which features Jacqueline Bissett Jack Klugman and Robert Duvall is also quite fine. But the script is weak the story choppy the film is a shade too glossy for its subjectand its incredibly naive portrait of gay men tends to overpower everything.All films must be considered in the context of their eras but even so a good film can transcend its era. THE DETECTIVE doesn't manage to do that sometimes ridiculous to the point of being amusing sometimes so grotesque that it becomes a bit embarrassing. All the same it remains interesting primarily because it offers a window on what mainstream Americans of the 1960s thought homosexuals were like. The DVD offers the film in original widescreen format the transfer however is merely acceptable. Recommended primarily to Sinatra fans and film historians interested in Hollywood's frequently offthewall portray of gay men.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:headline " Strong themes and acting save this otherwise messy film.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Detective 1968 Directed by Gordon Douglas Starring Frank Sinatra Lee Remick Jack Klugman Jacqueline Bisset Robert Duvall et al.This relatively unknown film features an impressive cast and a score by Jerry Goldsmith which were my main reasons for watching it. It has strong themes too though homophobia corruption and moral crisis. These are ingredients for a challenging drama but sadly the film doesn't use them well.The film has two parts which are intertwined with some flashbacks. The first part features Joe Leland Frank Sinatra investigating the murder of a homosexual the second part features him investigating a mysterious death and the flashbacks involve the relationship between Joe and his exwife. Thematically it's quite involving. Joe Leland is a nononsense cop who has to make some tough moral decisions. His colleagues have no respect for homosexuals and they even mistreat them while Joe beliefs they deserve a fair treatment. In one scene Nestor Robert Duvall is hitting a gay suspect and Joe must stop this so he knocks Nestor to the ground. A brave thing to do when most of your colleagues act like Nestor does. Another conflict involves politics. Promotions depend on them and politicians care more for money than for solving crime and the bad conditions for those living on the streets. Joe believes in hard work though and he wants to make the city a better place. These aspects make for the central moral problem of the film. Joe gets a promotion because he solved the first case very quick but doubts if he got the right person. Joe's doubt is shown really well in a scene which features Joe and some colleagues watching the suspect getting the electric chair but Joe can't watch. The second part of the film focuses more on the corruption in the force and on a political conspiracy. Joe with the help of Dave another rare honest cop played by Jack Klugman finds out about this through Norma MacIver Jacqueline Bisset who suspects there's more to her husbands death than meets the eye. This interests Joe since it gives him the opportunity to show that he wants the police to be clean and honest. But when Joe starts digging he learns some terrible truths from the death of Colin MacIver William Windom and what that means for himself. It appears MacIver's death and the death of the homosexual are linked together. This second part works really well story wise in how it is linked to the first part the two become one in story and theme. Finally there's the love story between Joe and Karen Lee Remick. While it's a tragic story and features some interesting problems it fails to really fit in with the other parts of the film. Karen can't commit fully to Joe since she can't stay away from other men which Joe can't cope with and therefore they separate. This makes Joe a sad person but it doesn't have a real importance to the overall plot and therefore feels more like a random side story. The only connection is that Karen's psychiatrist is connected somehow to the death of MacIver but I think that connection is too weak.The film is a bit of a mess though which comes from the fact that it deals with different time periods and some rapid shifting between locations. Continuity is a major problem for the love story. It appears Joe and Karen met some time before the murder of the homosexual but at some point the flashback seems to go into the timeframe of this murder and you loose track of where we are in time and it becomes confusing. This isn't helped by the bad use of locations at some point we think we enter Karen's apartment but a phone rings and Joe answers and it appears to be his apartment. This all makes it unnecessarily difficult to follow and to understand in what stage of their relationship we actually are thus harming the emotional aspect. The transition between the two parts of the film is awkward too since we suddenly jump forward for an unknown period of time which made me feel somewhat lost in the film. I couldn't help but feel that with some more care from the writer or director these problems could have been solved and the film would've felt more cohesive and the situations more emotionally involving.Director Gordon Douglas went for an 'experimental' approach but this doesn't work. For example he shoots persons talking to each other but lets them talk straight into the camera which frankly doesn't add anything and works distracting. The opening shot features a New York street upside down only to reveal that the camera is filming the streets' reflection in the car roof which I found to be annoying as were some bad back screen projections. The attempted style doesn't work properly and becomes distracting making the film feel dated. The actors deliver good work though. Frank Sinatra delivers a strong performance yet Lee Remick wasn't really special. The supporting cast is fine too with a lovely Jacqueline Bisset a strong Robert Duvall a friendly Jack Klugman and Horace McMahon delivers a strong performance as the police captain. The portrayal of the homosexuals is quite overthetop though with Tony Musante being the most overthetop as the psychotic suspect. The film is scored by Jerry Goldsmith but I found it to be one of his weaker scores. It's a sad jazzy score portraying the problems haunting Joe but I didn't really like it. The underscore in scenes between Joe and Karen works the best and is quite pleasant but overall it was slightly disappointing.All in all this is a film which dares to tackle a controversial subject but is brought down by continuity problems and a failed attempt at innovative filming. The acting and the moral problems Joe is presented with make this film earn a positive rating though.610.".

Frank Sinatra plays a Detective who is given a soughtafter promotion due to his coercion of a confession from a terribly guiltridden homosexual. Later Frank fully realizes what he has done and tries to set things right by reinvestigating the case and putting the right man behind bars. Frank shows some surprising range in portraying the moral ambiguities that run through this man. All this while trying to hold the fragile sexual nature of his relationship with Lee Remick together.This movie dealt with some pretty ugly homophobia and adult sexual issues in ways not seen too often in 1968.Robert Duvall had an early role as one of the squad Detectives.".

As well as the Chairman Of The Board's leading role as he goes into the sleazy background of New York's grit you have also strong lead performances from Norman FellJack Klugman and others makes it worth watching until the shocking ending.Can it on cable if it comes on.";

Gordon Douglas directed Sinatra five times beginning with Young At Heart in 1954 by far the best of the five inasmuch as it exploited Sinatra's two strengths Singing and Acting. One of the other four was Robin And The Seven Hoods in which The Rat Pack enjoyed themselves on screen and two of the other three Tony Rome and Lady In Cement allowed Sinatra to enjoy himself on screen without the Rat Pack but sandwiched in between Tony Rome and Lady In Cement was The Detective arguably Sinatra's last halfdecent film though feel free to nominate Dirty Dingus Magee or The First Deadly Sin. For ninety five per cent of the time Sinatra puts his mind to acting losing himself in a character and there are only fleeting moments  the lookgrin he gives Al Freeman in the opening sequence when Freeman says 'I hear you're the best detective in town  when he reverts to 'being' Sinatra. Horace McMahon must have felt he was caught in a timewarp having played the same role captain of detectives in William Wyler's Detective Story back in 1951 but he offers solid support as do Ralph Meeker Robert Duvall and Jack Klugman. Lee Remick is as good as she always was but Jacqueline Bisset seems ill at ease in a largely colourless role. It was probably outspoken for its time but we look back in irony forty years on as the same corruption Joe Leland was seeking to expose and eliminate is still in business at the same old stand. A lifelong Sinatra fan of both his singing and acting I find this  along with The Manchurian Candidate  one of the most watchable of his 60s movies.".

Apparently he'd been murderedand viciously so. I'd talk about that further but IMDb has limits on the sort of words you are allowed to use in reviewsreally. I read from one of the other reviews that this film was Xrated. While by today's standards it might only be rated PG13 it still is pretty intense stuff. Additionally the recurring theme of homosexuality make this a very interesting film its candor is shocking for 1968 but I appreciated it.The detective investigating the crime is played by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra is odd in that although he's a very good cop he's also stuck with a liberal conscienceand his conscience troubles him throughout the film. What also bothers him is that although he's extremely effective on his job other cops seem willing to do almost anything to rack up the same arrest and conviction statistics as Sinatraand he soon gets sick of this. His disgust however is a lot to get a lot worsewhen a case involving corruption in his department and in the city drops into his lap.I really liked this film. Much of it was because although it was very adult it never really seemed gratuitous. It also brought up a lot of wonderful moral questions about being a copand clearly was the influence for such later films as McQ Dirty Harry and Serpico though this last one is based on a real case. Well worth seeing and an excellent performance by Sinatra. In fact it's all so good that I am shocked that its overall IMDb score is less than 7. This film is anything but ordinary.By the way this film is very blunt and crude on occasions when it talks about homosexualsand is sure to offend some. However despite this it's a very progressive film for its time and actually is quite sympathetic in how it deals with the subject....sympathetic and sad.".

Lee Remick just didn't seem to have any of the required chemistry with Sinatra which is a huge detriment to the film as their relationship was the paramount one that the film choose to hinge on. Also the film is totally bereft of humor of any kind given it an arid feel which would have been fine if the subject matter was compelling enough to warrant such an approach it wasn't.

It has a great cast including Lee Remick who's always great and who seems to be attracted to movies of this ilk like Experiment in Terror and No Way to Treat a Lady. It makes good use of time and place and its use of flashbacks comes off surprisingly well to portray the courtship of Frank and Lee which you don't expect in a movie with a violent subplot in it. But which is the subplot? But I did appreciate its time in telling his own personal life rather than just centering on his case. And he's not surrounded by girls. So if you're looking for something flashy like Dean Martin's Matt Helm this isn't for you. It's better it's a mature film with real life consequences.

Throw in an incredible coincidence and you've got a movie that's OK to watch but not on the list of the great cop dramas.  The good cast helps liven things up Jack Klugman warming up for his Quincy days Robert Duvall as a bigoted cop and Ralph Meeker as a corrupt cop are especially fun to watch.  As for the principals Sinatra is hard to believe as a lifer cop and Remick with her big hair and miniskirts is hard to take seriously.  Good time filler fare but if you're looking for a message look elsewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Broken Wings is a poignant sliceoflife drama about an Israeli family's coming to terms with the death of their father nine months earlier. The widow Dafna is a 43 yearold mother of four who works endless hours as a midwife at the local hospital both to earn money to support her family as well as to avoid having to face the reality of the tragic loss she has suffered. For while she is a loving devoted mother she seems unable to provide the guidance and solace her children need in this time of incomprehensible grief and suffering. Thus the children are left to cope more or less on their own as best they can  and this on top of all the problems young people face just doing the ordinary daytoday business of growing up. Her oldest son Yair has responded to his father's death by dropping out of high school and adopting a fatalistic philosophy declaring that life is nothing more than a series of random events that mean nothing against the backdrop of an immensely vast impersonal universe. The oldest daughter 17 yearold Maya has hopes of becoming a successful rock musician but finds herself having to carry the burden of raising the two younger children while their absent mother spends most of her waking hours at work. The two youngsters Ido and Bahr cope with the loss of their father and the inadvertent neglect from their overworked mother in various and heartbreaking ways. The narrative is paced in such a way that we learn about the life of this family only through bits and pieces of carefully revealed information with each scene exposing more and more about the people and their situation until ultimately a full picture emerges. In fact it is a good half hour at least before we even know that the father is dead.The movie takes a very lowkeyed approach to its subject matter showing in an understated fashion the devastating effect the death of a parent can have on a family unit. The film is filled with lovely little moments of humor warmth and insight that draw us deeply into the drama. We see how each of the various characters responds to the situation and to each other watching as the feelings of guilt resentment and recrimination bubble to the surface. As a second crisis hits the family a whole host of longdormant feelings and emotions finally break out in open conflict. Yet as with a wound that needs to be cauterized before it can heal this second trauma proves to be the rupture the family needs to begin its process of recovery. The amazing thing is that writerdirector Nir Bergman is able to do all this in an economical 82minute running time. Yet even with that limited length the filmmaker captures the texture of the family members' daily lives through an impressive array of sharply drawn subsidiary characters who play an integral part in the central drama.Bergman has also been blessed with firstrate actors in the primary roles. Orly Silbersatz Banai as Dafna Maya Maron as Maya and Nitai Gaviratz as Yair deliver beautifully realistic heartfelt performances. The other cast members are all excellent as well.Broken Wings is a small overlooked gem that gets to the heart of what it means to be a family. It would be a shame for anyone to miss it.".

I guess the secret belongs to the fact that the movie started as a short film when Nir Bergman studied cinema and then he developed it to a full length movie. Moreover this movie is one of the representatives of the new Israeli movie age after understanding Israel cannot produce big budget American style movies and started producing small touching movies.The story in a nutshell is about a single mom with four kids trying to overcome the loss of their father. The movie time quota is within one week so everything happens very fast and sometimes it feels like someone is hitting you with a hammer in the stomach. other times it feels like someone is squeezing you for tears. Generally speaking the movie sure is an emotional roller coaster. The movie follows the story of the rebellious daughter who is torn between her will to be a singer and her family duties because her mom is working night shifts as a nurse. It also follows the enigmatic closed son who had to be the strong man of the family because of the death of the father and the effect the death had on his personality emotions and his functioning in school. Last but not least is the small child who has some kind of an accident during the film which makes everything move even faster and more emotional. The actors especially Maya Meron but that's because I'm a fool for her are doing a great acting job and are very moving and realistic.All in all this is a great movie highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "More and more these days I come out of a film feeling cheated. I find that especially true of American films where technically everything is wonderful and yet there is an emotional laziness that makes me feel unfulfilled. The writer needed to write three more drafts and the director should have gone the extra mile with the actors but instead chose to focus on lens choices and fast slick cuts. Broken Wings is the antithesis of this phenomena. A wonderfully unpretentious deeply personal and beautifully written piece that leaves you with the feeling that perhaps your life isn't so bad after all. The film follows the life of a mother and her four children desperately trying to cope with the emotional and financial aftermath of their father's death. The brilliance of the writing in my opinion lies in the ability of writerdirector Nir Bergman to convey the devastating fatigue and hopelessness of poverty with a wonderful wit and humor. The camera serves the plot rather than the ego of the camera man. The entire cast delivers a remarkable performance that is understated and personal. Eliana Magon who plays the little girl looks like she is carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders. Run to see this movie.".

I was most eager when I finally get to see Broken Wings. It was a filmic experience full of human family emotions  those ever anguishridden teen growing pains conflicts and raptures  I was quite pleased tearjerker and all.Broken Wings aka K'Nafayim Shvurot 2002 a film from Israel in Hebrew with subtitles is the debut feature of writerdirector Nir Bergman. It may seem like yet another movie about teens mother and kids in a struggling household  somehow there's a different tone and humanity level that's most warm and welcoming in feeling. Good story thoughtful plot with trying crisis and heartfelt performances all round. And the music  especially the song Maya sings the lyrics and the guitar rhythm I really felt akin to.It's a closeknit family  it shows the dialog between mother and daughter the interactions among teen sister and brother elder brother and youngest sister brother to brother mother to sons  there's a lot going on and not without sprinkles of humor and playfulness injected in between. It's a poignant script Bergman delivered. And what a cast  each of the family members was portrayed with such nuance. Orli ZilverschatzBanay is Dafna the mother a central tour de force. Equally matched is the strong performance by Maya Maron as the daughter whose sadness and bottledup selfblame became a huge chip on her shoulder  struggling with her musical talent composing and singing and trying to be vulnerably strong 'I can take care of myself' persona as a responsible daughtersisterstudentband member  life without Dad is so tough or is it? Mother doesn't care doesn't have time to love me is it so? Ido the younger son reminds me of Edward Yang's Yi Yi  also a young boy on his own while the grownups and siblings exist in a different world. Daniel Magon plays Ido and Eliana Magon as the little sister Bahr  the pair had a street crossing scene with just as much tension felt watching their performances together. Nitai Gvirtz portrayed teen brother Yair who's a character unto himself. Vladimir Friedman is Dr. Valentin in the tension relieving role of Dafna's colleague provided breather and smiles to the audience as well as the strungout working mother of four.Nir Bergman took the time to show us the different character developments  not shying away from confronting situations or gutsy parentalteenage tensions. Broken Wings depicts how a family unit copes with grief and how crisis unites coming through with strength and renewed understanding. It's a worthy family drama. We're fortunate to have effective subtitles by Suzy de Lowe. Bravo to Sony Pictures Classics for the steady support in distributing gems of small independent foreign films. An observation the cause of death was given in a low key manner  nothing political about it as it seems to be a possible natural happening. Hence the central energy is more focused on the mother and daughter relationship  such wisdom in plot progression choices. If you're interested in a film that has a bit more political tone try the Palestinian film by writerdirector Elia Suleiman Divine Intervention 2002 aka Yadon Ilaheyya in Arabic and Hebrew with English subtitles  it's quietly political pathos with poetic tenderness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blackbird singing in the dead of night. Take these broken wings and learn to fly. All your life you were only waiting for this moment to arise.  Paul McCartneyThe trauma that accompanies the sudden loss of a beloved family member is being repeated all over the Middle East today in both Israeli and Palestinian homes. Behind the headlines however is the human tragedy the stories we never read about. This story is told metaphorically in Nir Bergman's brilliant first effort Broken Wings. It is not an overtly political film but the implications are clear. Set in the Israeli port city of Haifa it depicts the effect of the loss of the family's patriarch on each member of the Ulman family perhaps suggesting the emotional state of Israel since the murder of Yitzhak Rabin. The 83minute film won accolades at the Berlin International Film Festival and has been a huge critical and commercial success in Israel winning nine Israeli Academy Awards in 2003.Beautifully expressive Maya Maron in her first feature role is an Israeli teenage singersongwriter also named Maya who dreams of becoming a rock star and wears wings when she sings in her local band. As the film opens Maya is singing a song she wrote in memory of her father who died suddenly nine months ago for reasons not disclosed until the end of the film. Her song is interrupted when her mother Dafna stage actress Orly ZilberschatzBanai a nurse phones and tells her that she has been called to work on the night shift at the local hospital and needs Maya home to take care of brother Ido Daniel Magon and sister Bahr Eliana Magon. Maya emphatically refuses then relents but the tension between mother and daughter is palpable. Maya who was with her father when he died does not fully grasp the guilt behind her bottledup rage and takes out her anger on her mother who is both irritating and sympathetic as she labors wearily to keep the family from a collision course. We learn that each family member is suffering the father's loss in his or her own way. Dafna stayed in bed for three months leaving the children to do the parenting and the results are reflected in their erratic behavior. Sixyear old Bahr wets her bed and Ido carries out a strange ritual of filming himself while jumping into an empty pool. The oldest brother Yair Nitai Gaviratz also a teenager has been suspended from school and hands out leaflets on commuter trains dressed in a mouse costume while expressing a nihilistic philosophy to anyone who will listen. His inability to respond to the words father fear and anger during a word association test prompts his school counselor to deny him readmittance until he receives treatment but he does not help his cause when he tells the counselor Your words are meaningless. This conversation does not exist and you don't exist.Yair tells Maya that things could be worse and they do get worse before they get better. In fact the catalyst for redemption comes in a lifethreatening accident that allows the family to regroup take responsibility for their lives and begin the process of healing. Broken Wings sounds depressing but in the hands of the skillful direction of Mr. Bergman its sadness is balanced with humor and the strength and dignity of its characters. The film does not break any new ground but displays the kind of insight that allows us to learn something new about ourselves. Though rooted in reality Broken Wings has a heart that leaps and a soul that soars and is a film that I truly loved.".

Dafna played with conviction by Orly Silbersatz Banai is excellent as the over burdened mother. Maya Maron is the rebellious Maya basically the central role of the story.

However on the night of her first gig she is called home to look after her young brother and sister while her mother goes to a nightshift at the hospital. This is the pattern of Maya's life since her father died about 9 months before  her mother Dafna never seems to be around her elder brother seems to be on a downward spiral of depression while the youngest children seem adrift and distant.Whenever I sit down to watch a film that comes from Israel it is tempting to assume that the film will deal with or at least touch on the troubles there. That was the case with this film and I was pleasantly surprised that this was actually a drama about teenage relationships and difficulties. The plot focuses on Maya but draws in the other characters into a story that is rather lowkey and small but manages to be involving and rather moving. It's not perfect of course and some viewers may find it's pace a little slow and the insular nature of the drama to be a little folded in on itself especially if you expected the wider conflicts to be drawn into it in some way. As a teenage drama this is rather touching and is an enjoyable little drama that is based on a well written script.The performances are also very good and there aren't really any weak links in this regard. Maron is well cast and her Maya is interesting and sympathetic. Banar has a more difficult role but does it well and keeps the audience with her. Gaviratz is good even if his character is the most difficult to get to know the younger children are also good and rise above the usual cute performances that Hollywood seems to draw from kids on a regular basis. The film paints a small family drama on a little canvas and the good cast are a major part of producing a story that really engages.Overall this is an enjoyable little family drama that is quite involving and quite touching. The characters are well written and well delivered by a roundly good cast. Short and bittersweet and well worth a watch if you can find it  everywhere in the world there are families and teenagers and everywhere in the world they have conflict.".

In fact it's the first ever Israeli film i've ever seen. Looking at the rather simple plot line I was worried that it would be too boring. I gotta say that despite the simple plotline that it was still rather meaningful as I'm sure many families around the world experience such trials in their lives. Parents and their children fighting even over the smallest things.I just thought they could have expounded a little more on the lives of the family after the death of the father. Indeed too short at 80 mins. I thought the acting was pretty good especially from the two lead actresses. You could really feel the tension between the two as they argue.Nice film overall with good acting performances".

I like those kinds of movies and this is one of the better ones. I think the best part about it is I like putting myself into one of the characters situations. Then I ask myself What would I do? if I was dealing with what they're dealing with. Several ideas run through my mind at the same time and all are hard thoughts to think about. I hope that's just my preferable taste in movies instead of me being a depressed negative person.A 17yearold girl named Maya Ulman Maya Maron has written a song titled Cartoon Lyrics and dedicated it to her father whose death was unfortunate unspeakably. Maybe one of the biggest events of Maya's life was turned around because of her mothers Dafne Ulman Orly Silbersatz Banai random night shift at the hospital. Maya is so emotionally unstable because she blames herself for her father's death. She was with him and she could've saved him. She and her mother can't get along seeing is that they are both emotionally unstable. Her mother works at the hospital and when you have four kids to look after night shifts can be rough. Maya is given the chance to record by a phone call of some big time music producer but after the recent hospitalization of her younger brother and problems with her guy friend she declines. Maya's twin brother Yair Nitai Gvirtz is a mouse. Really it's his job go to around handing out applications in a creepy mouse costume. After the fathers death Yair has dropped out of school and has since then lead a fatalist life neglecting his siblings his mother and his ex girlfriend Iris Dana Ivgy. Iris departed for a while for reasons I forgot she is inattentive toward Yair when she returns. He did not write to her in her absence. Both Yair and Iris condition at school is the same because neither can come on campus unless medically and therapeutically treated.Maya's youngest brother Ido Daniel Magon has depressed issues with his mother and takes it out one himself. Maya's younger sister Bahr Eliana Magon feels as if she is always neglected and that scares her. Ido has a peculiar take for dangerous stunts and for his very nice camcorder. His stunts lead him to his 'down fall.' Maya is late for her first day of school because Bahr won't go the preschool without her mom Ido skips school because it was either that or be beaten up by some cowards his age. Broken wings means I can only safely assume the once stable family that soar are now broken. Broken but not permanently this movie tells us so. Two brothers two sisters and a single mom and an unforgotten father are there to tell us a story about a broken wing. You realize that it takes lots and lots of duck tape to fix a broken wing.This movie was hard to write about. One because it can only be explained nicely if you watch the movie and second this movie has so much in it for a ninetyminute film. So it is difficult trying to get my opinion down gracefully.

	schema:reviewBody "How fragile life can be! A single bee sting can devastate a family when it takes a muchloved father. Shattered in their bereavement the family struggles on like a ship without a rudder. Each member has new duties to perform more responsibilities to undertake. Mother Dafna strives to care for her four children and continue her work as a nurse at the hospital. She is sleepyeyed through most of the film. Her eldest daughter Maya writes sad songs about her father and sings with a band but has to forego this pleasure to look after the younger children. Her young brother Ido likes to make movies and films himself jumping into an empty concrete swimming pool. A rather silly thing to do as he hits his head on the solid concrete and ends up in hospital in a deep coma. When Maya forgets to collect her little sister from school the child wanders home in the rain crossing the very busy streets. We expect another death in the family at any minute. Maya's brother Yair is going through one of those teenage stages philosophizing about us mortals being no more than a speck in the vast universe. On the whole the family is pretty normal and indeed likable. There are many such families around the world. Their dad is no longer with them to guide them and care for them.The story unfolds smoothly yet sadly and with a slight touch of comedy at times with irritating moments that we all experience such as a car not starting up at a critical moment. Mother's frantic outburst in hospital screaming at her son to wake up from his coma pleads with the doctor to use his knowledge and give him something to rouse him. We understand her dilemma and the thought occurs to us that he may never wake up.Mother is very tired from the strain of recent events and it seems that the doctor is also rather tired. They are also two lonely people who find comfort in each other's presence. Lying in each other's arms stretches the imagination beyond belief. Does this really go on in Israeli hospitals? Both mother and son strive in their own way to wake the young boy from his coma. the mother offering a mother's love and the son urging him to play his favourite sport. But will he ever wake? As this film shows life is fragile. life is full of uncertainties. This is not a happy film but it can and does inspire and many will see themselves in similar situations.".

Dafna's case is easy to find anywhere i believe. the point is she has to work. if she don't need to worry about money it could be easier for her and her family? i doubt it. but another movie called Panic Room which the mother don't need to worry about money and the daughter is clever and independent. where does their cries come from? from having too much money that they bought a big house? from there isn't a guy there to help them? well again a question of a single family. imagine if Dafna has no child her husband's death will have only leave her a lonely and quiet life just like what was described in that movie called Three Colours Blue in which the woman Julie felt meaningless about her life for a while.... does it mean that woman without a husband without a bf without a family will make her life empty? but if she has all it would turn out to be some trouble for her? if she can not balance herself and the family ? i would say it is natural and common that Dafna got some help and comfort from that doctor. at least he listens and feels about her life. but isn't it a kinda failure of this best movie? for a single woman she must be strong and clever. she must foresee what will happen to her and her family. she must find solution in advance. otherwise crises can not be prevented from happening. in the end i would say in all my DVD collection the broken wings i category it to one of my best collections.".

Also I thought the whole story became contrived due to the ending and the silly and unnecessary romantic angle between the mother and the doctor.This film has no energy and in being such succeeds in letting the viewer feel as depressed and frustrated as the characters themselves. It's funny how a 87 min movie feels like 2 hours or more...Despite all that the four kids are wonderful in this movie. I especially liked some of the scenes involving the two older children including a counseling session with the son the meeting in afterschool hours between the son and his friend Iris and most of the scenes with the daughter. There are some beautifully shot scenes in the son's bedroom and the abandoned pool. The concept behind the characters and how they are coping with their father's death were good.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Nir Bergman creation is considered as one of the pinnacles of the Israeli cinema. The story is universal but also very intimate and local. Haifa the workingclass industrial and port city is the perfect background for the movie. an old Israeli song has the line Haifa  A real city and like the city in the background the characters are all very real. Dafna Silbersatz Banai is a wary midwifenurse constantly escaping her unsolved grief of her recently deceased husband. The older children Maya Maron and Yair Gaviratz try to find their own ways to cope with lose like their mother they rather run away than confront. The younger son Ido Magon is acting calm on the surface but his risk taking acts and social avoidance are showing the cracks in his psyche.When the fragile family is facing a crisis the characters must confront and solve their own grieving and accusations.Maya try to escape to TelAviv the prototypical big city. TelAviv is only 100km south of Haifa but might as well be lightyears away.

Haifa the workingclass industrial and port city is the perfect background for the movie. an old Israeli song has the line Haifa  A real city and like the city in the background the characters are all very real. Dafna Silbersatz Banai is a wary midwifenurse constantly escaping her unsolved grief of her recently deceased husband. The older children Maya Maron and Yair Gaviratz try to find their own ways to cope with lose like their mother they rather run away than confront. The younger son Ido Magon is acting calm on the surface but his risk taking acts and social avoidance are showing the cracks in his psyche.When the fragile family is facing a crisis the characters must confront and solve their own grieving and accusations.Maya try to escape to TelAviv the prototypical big city. TelAviv is only 100km south of Haifa but might as well be lightyears away.

The characters are so authentic the script peppered with sibling insults that ring true silences that speak eloquently and images that linger in your mind as you join this family in its struggle to return to Life.One of my very favorite scenes was when Dafna finds Dr. Goldman asleep in the hospital. Tired and dazed she simply sits on the edge of the bed not thinking not feeling just sitting. We see Goldman's hand slip around her shoulder and gently pull her down to the bed where the two visibly relax beside one another. And for the first time in the movie Dafna's face has lost a bit of its tautness. So subtle and moving. But I have teenagers too so I found Maya and Yair wonderful as well. Yair's withdrawal into a Mouse was very clever and symbolic. And Maya peddling her bicycle back in the night from her missed gig the gauze and wire wings of her stage costume flying behind heras a symbol a tad obvious perhaps. But SO obvious that it's a wry observation so often our lives are pure undiluted ridiculous metaphor.I will seek more films from this director.

The 17 year old sister is having trouble at school and has written an achingly tender song about her father's demise which she is trying to sing in a competition when the film opens only to be called away by her mother who needs her to babysit so she can go to work. Her brother apparently her twin has dropped out of school altogether and taken a job as a handbill dispenser wearing a mouse costume. The mother is depressed and crushed by the burden of providing for her family. The story shows convincingly how each of the five finds a way back to the family through a near fatal accident to the younger brother when one of his jumps goes awry. The mother Orly Sibersatz Banai and the two older children Maya Maron and Natai Gaviratz are utterly convincing. Nir Bergman made this film with a small grant from the Israeli government. He has certainly demonstrated that millions of dollars are not required to make a superior film. However millions may be needed to hire wellknown actors and to enter distribution channels that will bring in a sizable audience. Too bad because this film is far superior to most Hollywood fare and even to the smaller independent films that reach their audience through art houses. Find it  if you can.

Basically I watched this in goofy grin mode throughout. This is a film for every duffer with two left feet  who has ever chased after a football and dreamed of glory.Basically following the failure of The Netherlands to qualify for the 2002 World Cup Finals a Dutch fan came up with the idea of an alternative final between the two lowest ranking countries in the world. Step forward brave Bhutan 202nd and magnificent Montserrat 203rd. Faxes were issued and the challenge accepted by both.  The film covers the build up to the game from both sides as well as the match itself.  It is a story rich in drama.  One week before the match neither side for vastly differing reasons has a coach.  Three days before the game they still don't have a referee.The game was played in Bhutan and while this tiny country has been on my must visit list for a few years now this film really made me want to go there....and soon and the tortuous route taken by the Montserrat team via  Amsterdam Bangkok and Calcutta suggested they were still trying to figure out where Bhutan was long after they had set out on their epic journey.This is a film about the joy of sport in a world far away from overinflated salaries and corporate sponsorship and also about the meeting of two very different cultures.  The Montserrat players are clearly more than a little stunned to be asked for their autographs.  The Bhutanese captain and centre forward dreams of playing for Arsenal some day although he knows it will never happen.As for the game itself it looks like all of Bhutan turns out to watch the epic contest and the local match commentary enhances the spectacle e.g. The Montserrat keeper looks very confident with the ball at his feet  just before he hoofs it straight to the Bhutanese forward.  The grass on the pitch is cut by hand with a sickle.  The penalty spot appears to lie in the middle of a marshy bog.  It's also not every game where a keeper sits down in his goalmouth and sulks after losing a goal.I guess the best tribute I can pay to this film is that not only did it make me want to visit Bhutan as previously noted but it also made me really wish I could have been there to see this game.  If only I'd known sigh!.  This is a magical film.1010".

Three days before the game they still don't have a referee.The game was played in Bhutan and while this tiny country has been on my must visit list for a few years now this film really made me want to go there....and soon and the tortuous route taken by the Montserrat team via  Amsterdam Bangkok and Calcutta suggested they were still trying to figure out where Bhutan was long after they had set out on their epic journey.This is a film about the joy of sport in a world far away from overinflated salaries and corporate sponsorship and also about the meeting of two very different cultures.  The Montserrat players are clearly more than a little stunned to be asked for their autographs.  The Bhutanese captain and centre forward dreams of playing for Arsenal some day although he knows it will never happen.As for the game itself it looks like all of Bhutan turns out to watch the epic contest and the local match commentary enhances the spectacle e.g. The Montserrat keeper looks very confident with the ball at his feet  just before he hoofs it straight to the Bhutanese forward.  The grass on the pitch is cut by hand with a sickle.  The penalty spot appears to lie in the middle of a marshy bog.  It's also not every game where a keeper sits down in his goalmouth and sulks after losing a goal.I guess the best tribute I can pay to this film is that not only did it make me want to visit Bhutan as previously noted but it also made me really wish I could have been there to see this game.  If only I'd known sigh!.  This is a magical film.1010";

But the actual game is only a small aspect in the movie. Both countries are introduced and their roads to the match are shown. I really like the movie because the cultural aspect of sports is shown in the movie. One Bhutan official says that this affect is more important than the competition. I totally agree with him. Before the match the two nations never heard of one another. This cultural clash is also a very important aspect of the movie. It is very funny to see the big Montserrat Players walk through the Bhutan town. The camera and photography is kind of awkward sometimes. You can clearly see that they didn't have a huge budget. I don't want to spoil anything but a bouncing football is a constant element in the movie. To sum it up I really like to recommend the movie to people who want to see a movie about two very different cultures that were brought together by football. And don't worry about the quality of the match. It lasts only 20 minutes. I would give it 9 out of 10 because I like the idea of the movie and it was funny. If you don't like special camerawork like strange zooming it's more a 7. Go watch it as long it's in theaters.".

	schema:headline " A film that shows the best values of football";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this documentary last week and given that the World Cup Final has just been contested the timing was entirely apt. This film details the build up to an unusual football match played on the 30th of June 2002 the day of the World Cup Final. In that game watched by a global audience of one billion people two titans of the game played each other for the ultimate sporting prize. The final outcome had Brazil defeat Germany in a hightech stadium in Tokyo. Meanwhile another football match was simultaneously being played in another corner of Asia. But this one was nothing like the one dominated by Ronaldo. It was instead contested by the two lowest ranked international football teams in the world. A Dutchman Johan Kramer had taken inspiration from his own team's failure to qualify for the big tournament. He started to focus on all the other teams in the world who mostly lost games of football the natural result of this quest led him to the two countries listed as 202nd and 203rd in the world  Bhutan and Montserrat. Contact was made with both federations and it was agreed that they would play each other on the same day as the 2002 World Cup Final.What this film really is all about is the joy and beauty of the game and the way it can bring people of different cultures together no matter the skill level. Where the top level of football has been taken over with corporate sponsorship astronomical wages and a winatallcosts cynicism that often results in extremely unattractive gamesmanship and playacting the people in this film are completely unaffected by any of these afflictions. By going back down to the lowest level of the international game Kramer has discovered an important truth about the sport in general. He has encountered players and fans who love football without any of the unattractive qualities that poison the game at the higher levels. The players are earnest and perform for the love of playing while the fans are uncontaminated by the nasty element that some supporters develop when the stakes are high.The game itself was the highlight of the film for me. While it was a friendly with no meaning outwith itself the players gave it their all and it was beautiful to see both the players and the fans having a ball. The local commentator was an absolute riot. His lack of exposure to the game meant that his observations were refreshingly original. His heartfelt empathy with the Montserrat goalkeeper after conceding a goal was touching while being very funny. As too was his confident assertion later that the said keeper 'really knows what he is doing with the ball at his feet' just prior to the player kicking the ball hopelessly to an opposing striker. His commentary was both hilarious and charming. We even had the always amusing sight of a dog running onto the pitch and walking around without a care in the world. These sorts of things just don't happen at Old Trafford or the San Siro.I won't give away the result although ultimately the score doesn't really matter. What does matter is that this football match was played and conceived in a way that is truer to the spirit of the game than the one played at the top level often is. For the record the big game two days ago was won by Spain who played a passing game that was in the best traditions of football while the Dutch tried to cynically kick them off the park. Luckily the best side won. The Dutch team maybe should look to one of their compatriots Johan Kramer and learn from him at least he eight years previously had done something on the day of the World Cup Final that truly celebrated the best of football.".

Disappointed with their team's failure to get into the World Cup some Dutch fans decide to organize the game. So they sent off two faxes. Both teams are eager to play. Montserrat is still struggling after a devastating volcano eruption. Bhutan is an isolated monarchy starting to reach out. The game brings together these two very different cultures.A cynical outsider would say that these Dutch guys are having some fun on these two teams. However everybody is so sincere that one can't help but get win over by them. It's fascinating to see these two cultures. There is some backstage drama with the Montserrat team but the movie doesn't expand enough on it. The game itself provides some tension about which team would actually win but it could have been shown in a more exciting way. It needs a professional commentator and an editing style to bring the game to life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Skin Deep starts off to a soulful bluesy song called falling out of love lyrically quite fitting for the main character and we see a woman walking into a house. The house belongs to Zach Hutton and the woman we assume is Zach's wife. She catches him fooling around with a young blonde and grabs Zach's revolver. The scene that follows is hilarious the music has stopped and we're thrust into a tense but funny moment. As it turns out this woman is not Zach's wife but his mistress and she is ready to kill him until his wife walks in. They introduce themselves and share their disappointment in Zach. At this point I needed to take a very deep breath to brace myself because it was very obvious that this guy has issues and this movie was going to be full of hilariously painful situations for our hero. It was no big surprise that within the next few scenes he's sobbing in a psychiatrist's office.This is a comedy that has an exaggerated sense of being true to life. It is somewhat serious Zach is a tortured soul but he's mostly casually tortured and takes his abuse with humour which makes it okay for us to laugh. He's a washed up writer his wife has left him with a settlement that was not exactly fair to his side and he can't get over his obsession with picking up women. He's addicted. This is one pathetic man. He endures some of the most hilarious situations ever committed to film I won't even bother mentioning the glowintheark condom sequence but yes it is hysterical. He also endures genuine sadness in his life and that makes him more human than just a simple comic sketch and makes this such a great movie.The ending wraps things up a little too easily but what the hell? Comedies usually have happy endings. The ending was satisfactory but the movie in general was above average. John Ritter was a master at perfecting both drama and comedy which is what was needed for this role. He did an amazing job and I feel it's his finest performance displaying his genuine charm as a comedic actor as well as the possibly even more intriguing serious side of a conflicted lost man. I love this movie.My rating 1010".

You watch as this man slowly and painfully spirals down and the women who try to help redeem him slowly get dragged down with him.  But Edwards is a master at allowing us to laughoutloud at his slow and quiet self destruction. Who will ever forget the....glowinthedark duel?  or the body builder? or how about the morning after in the guest room? The slow ride to rock bottom made his redemption all the more sweet. I was pleasantly surprised at how deep this movie truly is.  If you are looking for the slapstick of pure Clouseau this is not your movie.

	schema:headline " ONE OF BLAKE EDWARDS' VERY BEST";
	schema:reviewBody "Skin Deep was marketed incorrectly. Fox marketed this as a raunchy comedy. It is more of a companion piece to 10 rather than S.O.B. in that it is fairly serious as well.But this isn't all drama. Skin Deep is not only one of Blake Edwards' very best films it is probably his most successful combination of comedy and drama to date. Edwards wants to have it both ways and it succeeds.The film stars John Ritter as Zach Hutton a onetime famous best selling author who has stumbled. He is quick to blame it on writer's block but he has other problems. He drinks excessively. He womanizes even more excessively. His wife has left him after finding him in bed with his mistress' hairdresser. No I'm not spoiling the film for you Edwards makes this all clear in the first 12 minutes Hutton then sets out on a mission to get his life in order and gain his wife back. Right there Skin Deep resembles another film Paul Mazursky's great Blume in Love. But Edwards takes some turns that Mazursky never even considered. Yeah Zach wants his wife back but does he want to change? The answer could be no but I'm not saying yes either. As in his best films Edwards never gives any easy answers to the questions he asks and he simply records an existence.I've made Skin Deep sound awfully serious. But I want to say that Skin Deep is one of the funniest Edwards films I've ever seen. There are sequences here that rival the best Panther films in terms of hilarity. The house fire. The glowinthe dark condoms. The electrical therapy sequence. The tsunami warning. His sleepover at his best friends' house but I can't list them all. I want you to discover some as well. A real surprise is John Ritter. Most people have written him off as Jack Tripper from his hit TV series Three's Company but he has developed into a fine actor with roles in Sling Blade Unnatural Causes and Nowhere. Here he finds the right tone for all of his scenes. He can go from comedy to drama and always be convincing. It's a brilliant performance and it was a real shame the Academy couldn't recognize it.Skin Deep marked a milestone for Blake Edwards. At the time of its' release 1989 was his 50th year in show business. I've always been an admirer of his work and it gave me great pleasure to see that he still has it in him. It is also kind of sad that Edwards followed this masterpiece with the lackluster Switch.But at least Son of the Pink Panther was a good cap to a great career. out of 4 stars".

	schema:headline " Skin Deep is hugely underrated film from Blake Edwards";
	schema:reviewBody "John Ritter is Zach Hutton an alcoholic writer whose life is unraveling by the minute. Whether his writer's block was a result of his alcoholism or that he's taken to the bottle because of it is never firmly established with viewers. It's a moot point anyway as far as directorwriter Blake Edwards is concerned. Alcohol has driven Zach over the edge and he's in big trouble. The fact that he's able to easily charm his way into one brief sexual encounter after another and get by with his obvious intelligence only compounds his problems. Yet his sexual escapades and disheveled lifestyle contribute to some of the most hilarious scenes ever filmed in a movie. The real funny thing however is that Skin Deep is actually a serious film posing as a standard Blake Edwards slapstick farce its underlying theme is about the main character's desperate and dire situation. Zach is spiraling towards suicide even faster than he drives his sportscar. So why are we laughing? Others in the cast include Alyson Reed as Zach's estranged and exasperated wife Alexandra. She provides some gravitas to the film as does the great Nina Foch Zach's not too happy motherinlaw. Zach has been a huge disappointment to both of them and it's written all over their faces. Julianne Phillips Bruce Springsteen's first wife has a nice role as one of Zach's almost serious relationships. The best secondary role is reserved for Michael Kidd as Zach's psychiatrist Doctor Westford. His simple but critical advice near the end of the movie saves our hero from complete disaster. You know what I tell alcoholics when they want me to help them? I tell them to STOP DRINKING. At last his terse words of wisdom have an immediate and sobering effect on Zach and the recovery of his life begins. Skin Deep plays like a combination of two of Edwards' very popular and earlier films The Days of Wine and Roses and Ten. One minute it's deadly serious and in the next it's a rip roaring comedyoferrors. The balance is a delicate one and without the surehanded direction of Blake Edwards the movie would've fallen flat on its face. As it turned out Skin Deep was nowhere near a hit at the box office. That's too bad because the film is one of the better ones in Blake Edwards' career and certainly could use a reappraisal. Also John Ritter never gave a finer performance than he did in this movie. That fact alone should prompt interested viewers to find this film before it gets lost in the archives.".

I recommend getting your hands on a VHS copy of this movie and sitting down to enjoy yourself. It is classic John Ritter. Every time I watch this I own the tape I laugh so hard that I cry. I give it a 9 because it keeps you going. SPOILER  the dog superglued to the ceiling is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. This movie shows some of the best acting skills for some hardly seen actors. There was no possible way for them to make a followup movie but the directorproducerwriteractors should have gotten together for another project. It would have been great.".

Three's Company is my favorite all time comedy and It was nice to see Jack up on the big screen.I liked the premise of the movie but unfortunetly I will agree with many that the movie just didn't go anywhere it did have a tendency to become lethargecially dragging to the point where although you love Ritter and the plot you lose all interest in seeing how it plays out.Nowthat saidNormally I'd give a movie like thatnot terrible but certainly forgettable about a 5I JUST CAN'T DO IT WITH THIS ONE THOUGH. And that's because of that one scene that unforgettable scene that singelehandedly makes the film.I'm referring of coarse to the glow in the dark condom scene. The unexpected with that flows from this gem of a scene was Ritter at his besthe has to be one of the most brillient comedy actors around and that scene showed him doing what he does bestentertaining. Plus it's just REALLY funny.I'm picky about my comedies and what I fnd funnythis scene was hilarioussaw the mopvie in the theatre and this one scene had the whole movie theatre hysterical. So because of that I say the movie is worth seeing just because of that one scene. In fact if you are watching it and find yourself really boredwhich you very well might fastforward to the glow in the dark scene watch it and laugh to your sides ache! One of the most unforgettable moments in movie comedy of all time.All in all the movie's about a 5 but like I said that one scene brings it up 1 or 2 points. An unusual review for a mediocre movie that makes itself unforgettable through a few minutes of screen time.".

But his character Zach has far more substance than that although that substance is to reach his goal to screw everything that moves.  He's a playboy and he wants desperately to be on the up and up. But he can't shake his nature.  Ritter plays the goof at his best and the performances of the supporting cast Gardenia Reed Brooks Donat are perfect.

Another movie that this one reminded me of is Burt Reynolds' The Man Who Loved Women. The plot seemed to be the same. A womanizing man's ways catch up with him. Skin Deep was funnier though due to Ritter's comedy. The Glow In The Dark scene still holds up as a very funny scene today. I'm surprised I haven't seen it spoofed in one of many of today's gross out comedies as it would certainly fit right in.The comedy was certainly up to par but the movie makes you wait until the it is over half done to see it. The ending also seemed left a little unfinished. Nothing really happens to end the movie. It was very Adam Sandleresque with how all of the characters in the movie were now his friends and he was just successful without going into how he accomplished what he did despite all of his previous problems that hindered him before. Overall I give this movie a 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hefty housekeeper Marie Dressler as Emma becomes the surrogate mother to a wealthy Long Island family after their mother dies giving birth to Richard Cromwell as Ronnie. While helping her prepare for a welldeserved Niagara Falls vacation family father Jean Hersholt as Smith startles Ms. Dressler by proposing marriage and the trip becomes a honeymoon. Back home only Mr. Cromwell Dressler's favorite son celebrates the marriage. The three other Smith children George Meeker Myrna Loy and Barbara Kent are furious they feel the ailing Mr. Hersholt married a mere servant who will steal the family fortune.This is Marie Dressler at her sentimental best assisted by an apt MGM team including Clarence Brown director Oliver Marsh photographer and Frances Marion writer. Dressler won a Best Actress Academy Award for a previous effort Min and Bill 1930 however her Emma is a stronger characterization. This more deserved Best Actress nomination became the Academy Awards' 2 choice for the 193132 eligibility period in the voting Dressler was just behind winner Helen Hayes in The Sin of Madelon Claudet. Dressler should have won for Emma rather than Min and Bill.Richard Cromwell and Jean Hersholt might have been nominated as Best Supporting Actors but the category was not introduced until 1936 Dressler would have likely won the 192930 award in this category for Anna Christie. Parts of Emma have not aged well especially some of the early yet important scenes. But its strengths make up for these weaknesses. Watch for the scene in which Dressler throws her ungrateful stepchildren out of the house. This is followed by a scene with Dressler being haunted by the ghosts of the little Smith children it's an extraordinarily touching special effect. And it all works so well due to Dressler.Dressler is unfairly called a scene stealer most of the time she was just very good. If you were good you kept up with her. With material to work with Dressler's costars are just as memorable. Note how in lesser roles Cromwell and Hersholt compliment Dressler's Emma perfectly. Both Hersholt and Dressler play his death scene beautifully. And Cromwell's oneword description of Emma is the film's most lingering. You won't forget it.

	schema:reviewBody "This was an outstanding movie and Marie Dressler was at her best as usual!!!! This was slightly different from other Dressler roles because this was more of a dramatic role rather than her usual brand of comedy although she does have comedic scenes within the movie.She has so much depth to her role as Emma the housekeeper and nanny and one can actually feel the joys and happiness when she's working with the family as well as the pain suffering and sorrow she feels when her husband played by Jean Hersholt passes away. The scene that really got me the most though was right after inheriting her husband's money his grown children turned on her. These are the same children whom she looked after from their childhoods. After demanding they leave the house Emma begins to feel saddened by seeing visions of these young children she helped to raise from infancy. That scene really got to me. I felt her pain wondering How could these children grow up and turn on her like that? And when her beloved stepson Ronnie died that was really the clincher! I basically predicted THAT would happen but nonetheless I could still feel her pain.When watching this movie grab your popcorn AND a box of Kleenex because you will need them!!!!".

Thanks to IMDb I was able to go on one of the message boards and find out the name of the film and that the star who was a Marie Dressler type as I recalled was indeed Marie Dressler what instincts I had even in childhood. I was just able to actually see the film on TCM. I'd love to know why it is we remember certain phrases and scenes growing up  the parts I remembered in Emma were exactly as I recalled them.Emma is the story of a housekeeper who cares for a motherless family actually raising the youngest Ronnie Richard Cromwell when his mother dies in childbirth. The entire family is very dependent upon her. Mr. Smith Jean Hersholt over the years becomes very wealthy as an inventor so his kids grow up in wealth and with the exception of Ronnie become horrific ungrateful brats. Emma of course thinks they're wonderful and is blind to their faults. When Emma leaves for her first vacation Mr. Smith accompanies her to the station buys an extra ticket for Niagara Falls and proposes. The two enjoy their time there but it's to be their only time as man and wife. Mr. Smith's chronically bad heart gives out and he dies. All of his money is left to Emma with the proviso that she take care of the children who would squander every cent unsupervised. The children Myrna Loy Kathryn Crawford and George Meeker assume Emma is going to take all of the money for herself. To break the will they accuse her of murdering their father. Emma is put on trial for murder. Ronnie is away in the wilds of Canada and doesn't learn about this until the trial is underway.This is such a sweet story buoyed by the magnificent performance of Marie Dressler. What an actress! Warm strong and honest she pulls at your heart. The very handsome Richard Cromwell Angela Lansbury's first husband is the adorable and adored Ronnie and he gives an energetic performance. Cromwell had an interesting life. Not only did he enjoy some years as an actor in A productions but he was a successful artist his entire life. Eventually he opened his own studio. After years out of films he was scheduled to make one but withdrew when he was diagnosed with cancer. Jean Hersholt is excellent as Mr. Smith. Myrna Loy as one of the brat kids is absolutely stunning though she doesn't have much to do except to act stuckup.Highly recommended. Any movie that can stay in your mind and heart for over 50 years has something going for it. Emma had several things the best being Marie Dressler.".

The last post really covered the basic plot. Marie Dressler as Emma is the sweetest most darling character to ever appear on the screen. She cares for these kids from when they are born to when they are in their twenties and thirties loving them as if they were her own. Btw you can catch Myrna Loy in an early nonexotic film role as one of the kids! Equally amazing is Jean Hersholt's performance as the dad. This is the only performance of his that I have ever seen and anyone who wonders what the Hollywood humanitarian's acting talents looked like should definitely see this movie. It's very interesting that they give out an Academy award in his honor but they don't have any of his films widely available.If I could pick just five movies in the universe to recommend this would undoubtedly be one of them. Primrose Path w Ginger Rogers The Man with the Golden arm wFrank Sinatra Easy Rider and Stage Fright wJane Wyman would be the other four and they were VERY hard to pick just five!! So next time it's on TV make sure you watch it!".

	schema:reviewBody "EMMA MetroGoldwynMayer 1932 directed by Clarence Brown is not a screen adaptation to the famous Jane Austin novel of the same name but actually an original screenplay by Frances Marion for Marie Dressler whose popularity soared following her Academy Award winning performance in MIN AND BILL 1930. In the format tradition of Dressler's leading roles she appears in another sentimental tale with insertions of comedy where her character wins both heart and admiration from those around her particularly the movie going public of 1932. With the opening credits rolling to the underscoring of In My Merry Oldsmobile the story begins with a 1911 prologue set in a Long Island home where Emma Thatcher Marie Dressler works as a nanny in the Smith household. As Mrs. Smith character unseen struggles with her pregnancy she finally gives birth to an infant son born without breathing. With Emma's help the baby survives while Mrs. Smith succumbs leaving her husband Frederick Smith Jean Hersholt an inventor by profession to go through life rearing the infant and older siblings Gypsy Edith Fellows Isabel Dawn O'Day and Billy Wally Albright with Emma's help and guidance. Twenty years pass. Mr. Smith is now a millionaire living in an estate with additional servants Matilda Leila Bennett the maid Drake Wilfred Noy the butler with Emma still in charge of the household while the children now adults still looking up to Emma for advise and insurance. Unlike the others Ronnie Richard Cromwell the youngest raised by Emma as her very own looks up to her with great admiration even addressing her as beautiful. Of her many worries Emma's biggest concern is Ronnie's love for aviation. After 32 years of steady employment Emma finds it's time to take her long awaited vacation thus leaving the Smith family to be on their own. Frederick however after taking her to the train station proposes to Emma. They marry and go to Niagara Falls on their honeymoon. Having learned of this news in a newspaper the Smith children Gypsy Barbara Kent married to Count Pierre Marlin Andre Cheron Isabelle Myrna Loy a snob and Bill George Meeker find it very humiliating with the exception of Ronnie who finds it to be great. After Smith dies of an unexpected heart attack Emma is left everything according her late husband's will. The Smith children however feel Emma married their father only for his money and take her to court on a murder charge.Marie Dressler far from being a physical beauty gives a beautiful in depth performance as Emma a hard working devoted nanny in a much deserved Academy Award nomination. A well scripted theme on how lovable little children grow to become mean enough to turn against the one who sacrificed everything for them is quite essential even today. What makes this particular Dressler comedydrama succeed is the absence of her frequent costar Polly Moran who's presence is usually more annoying than amusing something that would have thrown this story off balance had she appeared. Rather than having Moran in support there's Leila Bennett in the minor role of a comical housekeeper. Though comedy has its limitations one scene played strictly for laughs is where Emma encounters a flight tutor airplane that goes way out of control when pressing the wrong buttons. Of the Smith siblings portrayed Richard Cromwell stands out as Emma's very own Ronnie. His very likable performance doesn't take any attention away from both Dressler and the youthful Myrna Loy early in her MGM career. Loy offers a fine characterization of an unsympathetic rich girl. Her charming and witty screen personality for which she's become famous would develop with each passing movie over the next few years. George Meeker Kathryn McGuire and Barbara Kent as the other snobbish siblings do well enough for themselves but don't gather enough attention from contemporary viewers to post comments as opposed to the more famous Loy. Jean Hersholt however up to this time notable for playing villains offers a heartwarming portrayal in whatever scenes he's in. One worth noting is where he tries to bid farewell to his housekeeper Emma Dressler at the train station capably handled with charm and humor. Other members of the cast consist that of John Miljan and Purnell B. Pratt as rival courtroom attorneys and Dorothy Peterson appearing briefly as Mrs. Winthrop. Of the handful of movies for which Dressler appeared starting with the Mack Sennett feature length comedy TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE 1914 that costarred the legendary Charlie Chaplin for years her name simply rests on the frequently revived allstar production of DINNER AT EIGHT 1933. As for EMMA it's certainly Dressler's finest achievement on screen and her most underrated. Regardless of its age it's still a timely story with a moral message quite relevant after all these years. Available on DVD EMMA can be seen and appreciated whenever broadcast on Turner Classic Movies cable channel. The next time anyone interested in hiring a nanny wonderful with children Emma like the movie itself is highly recommended. ".

	schema:reviewBody "This was truly Marie Dressler's finest hour. She was justly nominated for an Oscar for the lead role of Emma in this film. Clarence Brown who directed so many of Greta Garbo's films had directed Dressler as Marthy in ANNA Christie 19301 with Garbo and clearly appreciated her unique screen power by casting her in EMMA. It is not often that a 64 yearold actress can entirely dominate a film but that is what happens here. Among the cast was the young Myrna Loy. The film is based on an original story by Dressler's close friend the screenwriter Frances Marion. It concerns a middleaged woman named Emma who is the maid to a family of a man with three children. When the story starts his wife is in the middle of childbirth. She dies and the baby is also not breathing but Emma saves the little boy. She then acts as mother to the four children until they are grown up. She also nurses Mr. Smith the ailing father a gentle and caring person excellently played by Jean Hersholt. After serving the family selflessly for 32 years Emma's worth becomes suddenly clear to Mr. Smith and he proposes marriage. He then tragically dies on their honeymoon having made a will leaving everything to Emma because his unruly children are not responsible enough to handle the money so that he entrusts Emma with managing it for them. The eldest three turn on her viciously and take her to court accusing her of having murdered their father to grab the money. This is a very emotional film with lots of comical moments but it is also a bit of a weepie. It is a magnificent film of its time and deserves wider recognition. It shows the best and worst sides of human nature. As for Marie Dressler may her reputation never die.".

Even though at that time I was watching and enjoyed several vintage gems on TV it was not until that same dear friend screened several classic's on 'film' in his home thr for me that I came to fully appreciate the importance and power of strong writing combined with professional craftsmanship as a serious art form in film making. I imagine many folk today may still not know how to look at a movie like Emma  even I was wondering if it would sustain me to the end. While I might have edited a short sequence from early on I soon found myself being drawn in...the striking mobile camera shots the subtle controlled direction the changing moods of a well written story. This films young photographer Oliver T. Marsh 'San Fransisco' '36  A Tale of Two Cities' '36 seemed to work so well with the great humanities director Clarence Brown each bring such rich imagery to a variety of diverse moods within some unexpected situations. Such a pity this superb image maker was lost to us at just 49 yrs of age  seemingly to the demon booze  more wasted talent!For those who know or have yet to learn how to 'read' vintage classics and don't give up too soon this could prove rewarding. BUT let yourself run with the varied emotions as situations alter. While this may not be known as one of Clarence Brown's major works it is never the less a fine one. Besides how often do we see an overweight aging matronly female as the main 'star' not easy to sell to the 'glamour' generation she plays a character who gives unconditional selfless commitment to her charges even harder to sell to the 'me' generation. Award winning silent star Marie Dressler manages to convince all the way and gets good support from various troopers of the day like youngster Richard Cromwell the DiCaprio of his day playing her employers last born son and aviation enthusiast 'Ronnie' Jean Hershold as her gentle inventor employer with a strong portrayal from John Miljan as the committed District Attorney. In the background is truly glamorous startobe Myrna Loy not yet in her top billing professional form. It's pleasing to see TCM being more generous with adding some surprisingly long missing pioneering gems!. Keep em' coming please. KenR................".

	schema:headline " Good film with prominent early Hollywood stars";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1932 movie is about a housekeeper who is most responsible for raising a family of four kids after their mother dies. It's a good drama that portrays a kind woman who sacrifices her own personal life for the children of a widower. It has some good twists as the father becomes wealthy from inventions and the family moves into a mansion. The woman likes all of the children but has special affection for the youngest son who was born when Mrs. Smith died.When the children are adults all but the youngest are snobbish and condescending of Emma. Mr. Smith has been in poor health and finally marries Emma. Shortly thereafter he dies and the three oldest children accuse Emma of killing their father to get his inheritance which she knew nothing about. She is found innocent in a murder trial but the youngest child her favorite Ronnie is killed in a plane crash trying to get back to help her defense.Emma with her attorney finally gives all of the inheritance to the three remaining children. They have some sort of repentance for their treatment of her and beg her to stay. But she moves on to another family that needs her help. The movie seems to portray Emma as an unselfish person who sacrificed herself for others especially children. And it shows the conversion of the three adult children.But reading between the lines in this story is a shortcoming of Emma. She was in charge of raising those children and could discipline and train and educate them. She failed in that area because the oldest three grew up to be selfish and spoiled. So while she may have had a good heart and love for kids her weakness in not disciplining them led to their rotten characters. She even defended any strong words against them in the course of her trial. So this was the story of a wellmeaning woman who wound up doing more harm than good by her overly lenient supervision in raising children.This movie is not based on the famous novel of the same name by Jane Austen. Austen's Emma was later made into a number of movies. But this earliest Emma is from an original story by Frances Marion. Marion is little known in the 21st century but she was one of the best and most productive screenwriters of the 20th century. She did some acting and directing but became known as one of the greatest screenwriters of her time. She has nearly 200 writing credits for movies many during the silent era and nearly 50 for sound pictures.Marion won two Oscars for her writing  for The Big House in 1930 and for The Champ in 1932. She was also nominated for The Prizefighter and the Lady of 1933. Besides the story for this film Marion also worked on the 1931 screenplay that won Marie Dressler her best actress Oscar for Min and Bill. Marion began her writing career as a journalist and was one of the few female war correspondents of World War I.After winning her best actress Oscar in 1931 Marie Dressler was again nominated in 1932. That was for her role in this film. Dressler was a grand lady of cinema but her career was not that long. She was 46 when she got her first silent role in 1914. She made only 31 films but is most wellknown for the last half of her films that were in sound.Dressler was a large heavyset woman with a distinct voice and much talent. Audiences of her day enjoyed her acting. She played diverse roles. This Emma is a good movie that shows Dressler's film persona and abilities. Here a trait from her silent film days stands out. In doing double takes she suddenly becomes very wideeyed as though astonished. Marie Dressler died of cancer two years after this film came out.This is also a good film for a look at Jean Hersholt who plays Frederick Smith. Hersholt was born in Copenhagen in 1886 and trained for acting on the Denmark stage. He emigrated to the U.S. at age 27 in 1913 but bypassed Broadway for the movies in Hollywood. Hersholt was in more than 140 films and though a very good actor he never was nominated for acting awards. However he achieved fame and popularity for his work and promotion of the film industry and performers and for his humanitarian efforts. The motion picture academy later created and named its honorary humanitarian award after Hersholt. He was 69 when he died of cancer in 1956.One other performer who would later reach stardom appears here as well. Myrna Loy was 27 when this film was made and she already had 62 films to her credit  many in the silent era. Her 1934 pairing with Clark Gable and William Powell in Manhattan Melodrama began her climb to fame with audiences. She and Powell would make 14 films together mostly comedies and comedymysteries after that. She would also star with other leading men in films of various genres through the 1940s. And she would continue to play leads and major supporting roles in movies well into the 1970s. Loy died at in 1993 at age 88.".

If you like Miss Dressler fine. Otherwise you're left with a rather sudsy story against which the director's flowing camerawork can make little headway. However it's unusual to find Myrna Loy as the heavy even though she was playing such roles at this stage in her career. She plays a murderess who menaces heroine Irene Dunne in Thirteen Women 1932 for instance. No I'm not spoiling that excellent movie for you.

The girls are snobs. When the dead doc leaves everything to Emma Emma of course wants to give it to the children but the girls gang up on her and Emma is accused of murdering the doc while Ronnie flying to her rescue dies in a crash. Emma is found not guilty but realizing that she has no place in the home any longer after 32 years she bids the girls adieu and heads for the unemployment office or rather  what is it called now? The Employment Assistance Ministry? Anyway in 1931 it was the unemployment office and it still is though they transpose the name into Esperanto. Not to fear. Emma finds another loving family exactly like the dead doc's and everything ends happily.Marie Dressler is unimposing in every way except for her physical bulk. Her performance is of the period as is the sob story. The comic element is limited to Emma's fake solo in a flight trainer. I can't find the slightest thing original about it nothing that would separate it from dozens of other movies made during the early thirties.It isn't a BAD flick.

The movie amounts to a Dressler showcase tailored to highlight her unusual presence. As an actress she has more furbelows than a xmas tree which is to say few scenes pass without a number of eyecatching mannerisms. But as her career shows she was also an actress of impressive range. The movie's heart is in the right place. The trouble is Emma's Dressler selfsacrificing nobility is spread on with a trowel a foot deep while the comical interludes only mildly succeed. Nonetheless it's good to see the life of someone like a nanny commonly overlooked in glitzy Hollywood receive appreciation on the screen. I guess a sudden concern with the lives of those faceless men and women who make the country actually work was one positive result of the Depression upheaval.I agree with the reviewer who lauds the last 15 minutes. It's a very well thoughtout resolution that hits just the right emotional notes. Too bad the rest of the film doesn't reach that expert level.".

	schema:reviewBody "This small independent film was made for peanuts Filmed on a Canon 5D and just a handful of people in the crew and it is probably unlikely to make any big impact on the boxoffice. However I'm sure it'll leave a mark on those few who will actually manage to see it.Zo Hran is absolutely wonderful as Laure the 10 years old girl who's just moved into a new neighbourhood where nobody knows her and pretends to be a boy Michal with her new friends. Her performance is one of the best of the year and possibly among the best ever performances by a child she not only perfectly captures that innocence that children of that age have but at the same time she seems to have a deep understanding of the struggle and the pain of her character. Throughout the film she really acts as if she was a real boy in a way that's so believable that at some point I really started to wonder whether she was actually a real he. The film knows that and it does play with you by stretching the lie as far as it possibly can until it decides to show you the real truth in a beautifully handled scene where you do actually see briefly the girl naked. It's a fleeting moment and the film obviously doesn't linger on it but it's enough to put our minds at rest so that we can carry on enjoying the rest of the story.The director Cline Sciamma's ability to film children making it look real is incredible. It feels effortless as if the camera was one of the children themselves and we as the audience are left observing them playing in the forest as if we were spying on them or as if it was all a documentary. Rarely I have seen scenes with such young children that feel so honest and real the approach is subtle and light the atmosphere is almost muted dialogue to advance the story is used to a minimum and the silences are charges with meaning and intensity. This is a subject that rarely makes the news let alone the movie theatres. And it's so refreshing not just to see it depicted in this film but to have it told with such an understanding honesty and openmindedness. All this together with the stellar acting from little Zo make the internal drama of LaureMichal even more poignant and powerful. Be warned this is a slow film a very short one too at only 82 minutes that has French independent written all over it from its pace to its rough look and its lack of music score but if you like me love films about children growing up this sensitive tender and never heavy handed story might just melt your heart too.I saw it months ago and I still remember it vividly so it must have worked on me.moviegeekblog.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This sweet tender comingofage drama from Celine Sciamma is a real charmer.Zoe Heran plays Laure the tenyearold tomboy of the title who has moved with her parents and sixyearold sister to a new town. She'll be starting at the local school in a few weeks but until then she spends the summer babysitting her sister for her very pregnant mother while dad's out at work and hanging out with the other children that live in the apartment complex. The only problem is Laure has told her new friends that she's a boy and that his name is Mikael. Mikael becomes close to Lisa and a mutual crush develops. With the first day of school  and discovery of her secret  rapidly appraching Laure becomes increasingly anxious to keep hold of the happiness she finds in being Mikael.With the focus squarely on the children  a hugely endearing bunch of varying ages  a significant portion of the film simply shows them at play and those scenes are the film's best with the actors delivering naturalistic and thoroughly genuine authentic performances  it appears the director was simply content to just quietly and unobtrusively film from the background while they behaved like well children. The consequence is that it's a film full of laughter. That infectious laughter is so central to the film that it's still happily ringing in my ears hours after the credits rolled.Heran is great totally convincing in what is essentially both a male and female role. The most delightful moppet award goes to Malonn Levana as the sister. Wise beyond her years but a million miles away from all the Hollywood clichs that phrase brings to mind her relationship with Laure is the film's most important and the chemistry between the two girls is magnificent. The tenderness and understanding present in that relationship extends throughout the family as well the film is filled with quiet intimate moments shared between them. They're not cartoon characters and they're not idealised they're just a really nice little unit and it's a joy to spend 81 minutes in their company.It's not all sweetness and roses though. Mikael's selfmade predicament is as uncomfortable for the audience as it is for him. As he and Lisa fall for each other the unfairness of his lie starts to sting and simple things like going to the toilet cause problems too. Obviously things won't end well but when Mikael is finally discovered the fallout is refreshingly credible people get very very hurt and it's heartbreaking to watch.However Tomboy thankfully ends on a hopeful note. It's a rare trick to craft a film so uplifting so powerful yet remain completely committed to authentic human emotions and an admirable absence of audience manipulation.And wait 'til you meet that baby!

	schema:reviewBody "Tomboy is a feelgood movie of a type we're unaccustomed to seeing it doesn't end with killings or sex or a pile of money. It's a movie about children where the children aren't effigies of the adult audience with knowing wrinkles and smartaleck sneers carved on tenyearold faces. It is the opposite. It's a movie that can help the hardened and scratchedup adult carapace melt away for 80odd minutes. Through layers of paperwork and grime we watch and we imagine remembering what it was like to feel protected and loved by two tall and wonderful beings. What it was like to come home to dinner. What it was like not knowing who you were.The Tomboy is Laure a 10yearold girl whose family just moved to a leafy suburb. She has a summer to spend before school starts and for reasons unclear even to herself decides to fake it as a boy. Zo Hran the actress is a remarkable performer and will be a remarkable French beauty in another decade but in the film appears as a wiry scrawny child who wears feminine clothes only on pain of motherly torture. She runs in the forest scraps around with boys and can get away with being on the shirtless team in the soccer game.Here's something amazing about Hran's performance I kept having to remind myself that she speaks. In fact she probably has more lines than anyone else in the movie but they seem ephemeral compared to the great work that silently goes on in her mind. The camera watches her think with such intensity and expression and since this is not a dumb movie we don't get a voiceover that explains the obvious. We know what she's thinking how will I continue the deception on the field and in the lake? How will I prevent my family from finding out? And in quieter moments other thoughts other sensations attempts to understand things that she can feel but hasn't yet learned the words for.Her selfdiscovery is framed by a supporting cast that includes tender and attentive parents a cute little ball of energy for a younger sister a neighborhood girl who's attracted to the mysterious stranger and a colorful group of rambunctious but goodnatured boys.Tomboy was made for peanuts and there's no telling what it would have looked like with a few million dollars to spend but the feel and sound of it are perfect. In the day the hiss and rustle of trees at night the taps and groans of the house in the wind. I watched it in a dark dusty room on a New England January and I could almost feel the sunlight on my own skin.In the end despite Laure's anxieties this is a movie that shines with joy. A wideopen world of familial love summer play first romance none of which is packaged to be bought or sold. None of that firstworld paranoia no fences and kidnappers and card readers and metal detectors. It's a picture of the days when half an hour of homework was a jail term three months of summer were a lifetime and childhood itself was a skyblue eternity of invented games skindeep catastrophes and ineffable comfort at the steady hands of the people who wish us best.P.S. Then again we adults have our own joys such as the dismal acrid laughter at the stupidity of others. This movie didn't go unnoticed on the archconservative website The Free Republic which claims that the main character is a lesbian the word doesn't actually appear once in the script and the director is on record saying she specifically wanted to avoid pigeonholing her protagonist. Of all the extraordinarily strong opinions expressed in the forum thread not one appears to be informed by an actual viewing.The discussion starts out by claiming that the movie exploits small children to advance progressives' bizarre sexual agenda it takes a detour through gender reassignment surgery underage sex and ends in a starkly pornographic debate about bestiality.It's a trope that guardians of morality often have infinitely filthier and more disturbing minds under their helmets than the people whose work gives them shrieking fits. The debauched French have made a serene and charming movie about family and friends whereas our selfanointed protectors of children's minds and bodies used it as a springboard into bottomless perversity. The moral if you have a choice between reading a dour political site and watching a French children's movie go with the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tenyearold Laura has the look and the tastes of a boy. Now that she has moved to another place where she is a total stranger it comes naturally to her to introduce herself as a boy. Bye Bye Laura Hello Michael a new boy on the block. This is how she he? introduces herhim?self to her his? new friend Lisa and her gang. At first life is sweet it is summertime  the weather is fine  nobody suspects anything... The girlboy has the time her his? life playing soccer spitting on the ground and enjoying other testosteroneinduced pleasures. But things are not that simple. They never are. There are indeed a few mundane technical problems which are bound to come into play such as  how to do number one without being noticed?  how to transform a girl's one piece swimsuit into a boy's bathing costume complete with its pertaining bulge? and so on and so on... A variety of crude details that could easily be smutty in less tactful hands than Cline Sciamma's. But be reassured if Sciamma this is her second film after La naissance des pieuvres shows no complex when it comes to explore the gray areas of her subject she never indulges in any dirtymindedness. Cline Sciamma is indeed a serious artist with no taste for the easy way out a creator who believes in her subject and respects all of her characters LauraMichael's friends her little sister Jeanne her computer specialist father her pregnant mother... and although the direction is in no way showy the film gets more and more captivating as the story unfurls what happens to Laura first the architect then the victim of the fraud and as the trap closes on her. To these narrative skills you may add an interesting theme rarely tackled on the big screen. You can indeed count on the fingers of one hand the films exploring the mood of a young girl tempted to take the plunge from tomboy to boy to the core and more generally speaking analyzing the behavior of children who are still too young to know for sure which sex they belong to and accordingly try all the options. Tomboy goes deep into the uneasy question of children's libido which she had already done in La naissance des pieuvres although the latter film dealt with girls older than Laura. Devoid of any irrelevant sophistication brief and concise but cutting through to the bone Tomboy manages to keep the audience in turns interested puzzled and upset by a story which ends on the verge of tragedy. The young actors are wonderfully natural but Zo Hran as the tomboy is beyond all praise. No one else could have been more convincing than this exceptional young actress. You can't imagine a more suitable physical appearance way of speaking and attitude for the role than Zo Hran's. Just amazing! Her young partners Malonn Navanna and Jeanne Disson very natural in their respective roles of Jeanne Laure's feminine sixyearold sister and of Lisa Michael's new friend attracted to him provide two fine performances as well.Tomboy an outstanding second film is recommended to all those who favor ambiguity forays into little explored territories and strong feelings emanating from what looks at first sight as a mere slice of life.".

I suppose therefore maybe I bought this film as an academic companion piece to 'Ma Vie En Rose'.In either case the scenario had to be handled sensitively and proficiently by the actors and directors concerned to avoid their efforts descending into puerile comedic farce. Fortunately in both cases this has not happened.Celine Sciamma's debut as a Director 'Water Lilies'' was an almost claustrophobically tense dance of adolescent first love lust and friendship. This piece however retains the freedom and breathtaking joyousness of childhood without seeking to mask the truth for the sake of an adult's eyes.Zoe Heran is perfectly cast as Laure the ten year old girl who slips into the persona of Michael without a backward glance when she and her family move to a new neighbourhood. She is to be commended for her bravery in taking on this role as it cannot be easy for a child to be told that they would do well playing the opposite sex. Casting Zoe Heran's real life friends in the film was a masterstroke as their presence on screen gives the film a flyonthewall feel that just helps to extend the naturally joyous feel of childhood to the viewer.Inevitably any serious film collector or fan thinking of buying this film may seek comparisons between Laure and characters such as Saga Melinda Kinnaman in 'My Life As A Dog. Don't. This film is very much in the neorealist tradition of modern European cinema and as such the situation in which Laure finds herself is very naturalistic.I should not have prevaricated over buying this film. Watch it and enjoy your own childhood all over again!".

Laure resists the stereotyping foisted upon young French girls and is content to run free in shorts and tshirt as a tomboy and her parents seem at ease with her choice.However when she makes her first foray into friendship with a group of children who will soon be her peers at school she introduces herself as Mickel and they happily accept that she is a boy. Welcomed as part of the group of boys who swim and play football Mickel also forms a bond of friendship with Lisa Jeanne Disson a 'regular' girl who sees in him a gentleness and sensitivity that is absent in the boys with whom she too has kicked around.While never actually stated the probability of LaureMickel being unnoticed undiagnosed or just ignored transgender is evident but writerdirector Cline Sciamma prefers to take the gentler approach of studying social norms of gender types rather than a noholdsbarred sexual exploration.Tomboy is a beautifully subtle film that is dialoguelight but filled with the language of silence and unarticulated glances. The three young principals are confident and natural in their performances and Sciamma appears content to sit back and let them play their parts fluidly and without strict direction. The relationship between LaureMickel and Jeanne is particularly sensitively handled with the role of big sister meandering between the two according to circumstances.There is little input from the parents and they are credited simply as La mere and La pre but when the girls' mother steps into the scene her impact is immediate and stirs both judgment and understanding in the viewer.While Tomboy suggests questions that could be asked it stops short of dictating the answers and instead makes a suggestion that we may accept or condemn and though some may find the subject matter uncomfortable one hopes those very few who are attracted to this lovely film are not of the camp given to prejudice and fearinspired anger.Tomboy is a gentle film that deserves to be watched quietly and savoured in the company of gentle people.".

Sadly the simplest way to achieve this for her is to pretend to be a boy she did not intend to do it but played a game facing the mistake of Lisa. Yes she could have go play footballs a girl but most probably the boys would not allow her because she is a girl or exclude her if she wouldn't be good enough when she starts playing she is still quite insecure but accepted Lisa explains she wants to play but was excluded. Laure enjoys boy's stuffbecause they simply are fun driving a car or practical having short hair. But guess what she is not expected to do so as a girl! I believe this movie has nothing to do with transgender. It is about how society since the childhood reduces girls and boys to a particular role or look and makes it difficult for them to have individual preferences. Neither am I convinced that Laure is in love with Lisa. It goes with her role play and it gives her some attention. Laure is going to enter in the puberty she is still a child and there is at her age no visible difference between the body of a boy or a girl..which the movie really points out. Except this tiny one thing that she can still fake in her speedo. She even forgets it until she has to pie....The only way to see a difference is to take off her pants! She is even physically stronger. But she already has to fit into the box of what girls do and don't wear a dress for example. Why??? I believe she pretends to be a boy because she knows that she can still do it in a couple of year she will have to let behind her fake attribute she puts the penis with her child teeth as a souvenir of her childhood and become a woman. The image of her pregnant mother is reminding her of the real and only difference between genders. As I wrote I personally was a Tomboy because I wanted to play the same games as boys. Remember the film takes place in France and you can ask the female player of the best french female football team OL but many still think that you need a penis to kick a ball there... Childhood is just the beginning of facing the sad reality what you have between your legs is going to determine your rights and duties. Laure has the merit to defy the rule because she gets the opportunity...I feel sad of how she gets punish for it. I feel this movie is totally realistic. I hope and wish tit will open the eye on this kind of sexist behavior that adult unconsciously encourage. And BTW I found the 2 sisters acted brilliantly!".

	schema:reviewBody "French screenwriter and director Cline Sciamma's second feature film succeeding her awardwinning directorial debut Water Lilies 2007 tells the story about Laure a 10yearold girl who has just moved to a new place with her parents and her younger sister Jeanne. One day she encounters a sameaged girl named Lisa and gives her the impression that she is a boy by presenting herself as Mikael. Laure comes to like being someone else and does everything she can to maintain her new identity but as her friendship with her new friend grows and she learns that Lisa is in love with her she finds herself in a moral dilemma. This characterdriven novelistic and finely tuned independent drama which takes place during a warm summer in France is acutely written and directed by Cline Sciamma who goes closely into the heart and mind of her young and conflicted main character in this romantic humorous and intimate portrayal of a girl in the early stages of puberty who gets to experience what it's like to see life through the eyes of a boy after telling a somewhat unintentional lie to the first person she meets in her new neighborhood. Cline Sciamma's realistic atmospheric and subtle tale about identity comingofage friendship family and young love is thematically related to her feature film debut Water Lilies 2007 but has a younger cast and is a more lowkeyed depiction of selfdiscovery. This humane condensed and wellpaced study of character which focuses on social interactions between preadolescents is significantly reinforced by the young French actresses Zo Hran Malonn Lvana and Jeanne Disson's remarkable acting performances. A notable French production which gained the Teddy Jury Award at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2011.".

Unfortunately the entire thing was ruined by the last act.Everything the filmmakers had created was ultimately thrown away by creating an air of it's just a phase or conform to the proper gender norms of society. Gender identity is one of the most difficult and misunderstood things anyone can go through. Hell even samesex parents have admitted to having to get used to gender nonconforming children. It is an incredibly touchy subject that still requires grace when trodden. The film was handling all of this in a seemingly well done manner and I knew some conflict would have to arise for a lesson to be learned.What was the conflict? Mother finds out about daughter's masquerading as a boy mother flips out hits child and then pursues punishment in the form of parading her daughter around as a proper girl to the kids she had made friends with as a girl. The filmmakers tried to ease the mother's ridiculous outburst by saying she didn't mind her daughter playing the boy which made the insult even harsher as she continued to effectively ruin her daughter's life. Great parenting. I'm sure that kid will grow up to be quite healthy and balanced growing up in that home.What was the lesson? What should have been more of a Know Thyself film became a follow the herd film. Everything the mother did is supposed to be forgotten as if she is acting in the child's best interests aren't all parents? Please Google Love In Action Refuge. The line Don't you want to go outside and play? at the end literally made me say out loud WITH WHO?! You just took away all of his friends! The friends immediately turn on the child as kids do once they find out about her real gender and Mikael now officially Laure again is forced into dresses and girl things. The audience is supposed to feel as though everything will be all right when of the friends reaches out at the end. Unfortunately this only further solidifies the fact Mikael is now gone and it is time to grow up as Laure. Put away those childish notions of being a boy.To writerdirector Cline Sciamma please PLEASE stay out of things you do not understand. The LGBTQ community is much better off without you.".

Sciamma presents this fact in such a subtle manner that it is only in retrospect that the impact of the film is comprehended.A very loving family  the pregnant mother Sophie Cattani the tender father Mathieu Demy and two daughters  have just moved into a new neighborhood during the summer months. The younger daughter Jeanne Malonn Lvana is full of joy and creativity and is devoted to her older sister Laure Zo Hran  an extraordinary young actress. Laure dresses as a boy and going out to meet the new neighbors changes names to Michal. Though shy and obviously fearful of how the others will perceive Michal is for all intents and purposes a boy. He joins in games with the other boys meets a young girl Lisa Jeanne Disson who obviously is infatuated with Michal and retaining 'his' nature as a boy he enhances his swimsuit with a creation of clay so that he will appear male to all. Lisa visits Michal but only Jeanne is home and when Lisa asks for Michal Jeanne intuitively covers for Michal. Jeanne thus wins Michal's trust and is allowed to accompany him when he goes out to play with his new friends. Jeanne is happy to be a part of Michal's secret. But when a fight occurs as Michal struggles with Rayan Rayan Boubekri in defense of Lisa Rayan's mother confronts Michal's mother and Michal's secret is out. With cruel lack of insight the mother makes Michal wear dresses now and it is this act that destroys Michal's new identity and the problems that follow are best resolved among the children.The beauty of the film is that it is almost entirely concerned with the interaction of children the adults have only momentary roles. Cline Sciamma appears to be saying that most children pass through stages of gender questions. She is not championing transgender roles she is merely offering us a very sensitively drawn picture of how confusing moving form childhood to adulthood can be. Zo Hran's performance is stunning as his the performance of her 'little sister' Malonn Lvana. Young actor Mathieu Demy son of director Agns Varda and Jacques Demy is a true discovery. But the film's genius is Cline Sciamma. We will be hearing more bout this gifted artist. Grady Harp".

I had a feeling that the truth about Mikal would come out sooner or later but the way in which it came out and its aftermath in the film was quite harsh IMO. I think the humiliation that Laure endured could have been reduced if Laure's mother had simply accompanied Laure to a gathering of all the kids she had played with and then announced Mikal's true genderidentity to them at the gathering and then continuing to watch over them. Also the ending seems rather abrupt. It makes me wonder what Lisa's intentions were  did she simply want to find out Mikal's true identity or did she want to build a new relationship with Laure as her true feminine self? Since Lisa had mentioned earlier that Mikal did not exist on the class lists I would have had her continue by saying something along the lines of Oh so you are indeed in my class.

Fortunately it is available as a Netflix streaming movie and that is how I watched it with English subtitles.The young actress Zo Hran is really quite marvelous as Laure the older of two girls. She has a younger sister and treats her very well playing with her helping her at bath time or bed time. It is summertime and the family has just moved to this new community school will start in a few weeks. Laure always dresses in shorts and a tanktop shirt and with a short haircut looks just like one of the young boys in the neighborhood. When she goes out to meet them she says her name is Mickel. She is young enough and undeveloped that she can play soccer shirtless without looking out of place.Laure becomes fast friends with a girl of the same age Jeanne Disson as Lisa . We observe that Lisa often looks at Laure curiously as if she suspects something is not quite right but never says anything. They even become boyfriendgirlfriend of sorts sometimes holding hands and even giving each other innocent little kisses. In one scene they play makeup at Lisa's house and when she gets home mom comments how good she looks with a bit of makeup on. Mom and dad of course have no idea Laure is posing as a boy until another mother shows up complaining that their son beat up her son who had been picking on Laure's little sister.The movie does not broach the issue of homosexuality and frankly it doesn't seem that Laure had a desire or even knew what a lesbian is. From the content of the story and script it just seems that she was more comfortable being a tomboy and perhaps took it a bit too far seeking acceptance as one of the guys for soccer and other games kids play.It is a small move but very nicely done. The uneasy dialog seems typical of kids that age. When finally forced to confront the issue Laure seemed welladjusted enough that she will do fine after the embarrassment wore off.".

Indeed Laure pretends to be a boy Mikael as soon as she arrives in the neighborhood. The movie is thus centered on Laure's attempts to be look behave talk and act like a boy within the group while she is still hiding this double identity to her parents. This unusual plot is really interesting. First it raises deep issues that may ring a bell to some viewers. The issues of identity peer pressure gender and community are raised throughout the movie. Therefore Tomboy is the proof of movie's ability to raise personal questions in the viewers mind. Secondly the notions of active questions and suspense can be applied to this movie. While the time passes and Laure's attempts to look like a boy are compromised either by herself or by her peers. Thus during the whole movie a single question hooks the viewers is her identity going to be discovered?. Altogether through its content and its form Tomboy is a really interesting to watch if you are willing to think a little bit!".

	schema:reviewBody "Oshima is a director who usually leaves you in no doubt about what he thinks but he goes all out here. This film is a strong polemic against the death penalty as practiced in Japan. The condemned man fails to die and those in the death chamber panic and wonder what to do. After about five minutes of narration by Oshima himself the characters gear into action using Oshima's chosen method  black farce. This is a very funny film and all the more so because it confronts some very edgy stuff and often crosses the line to outrage. Oshima as he often does attacks Japan's sacred cows head on. As well as the death penalty he deals with prejudice against Koreans rape politics respect for authority and much more.The acting is excellent particularly the Korean who plays the condemned man. His calm poise provides an excellent balance to the mania of the officials around him as they try to make him remember who he is and what he's done.Strong stuff warmly recommended.".

If that were the only benefit and if this were the only recommendation I would get it would be worth it.By reading the comments you may think that the main value of this film is a damning polemic on capital punishment plus a perhaps more powerful examination of Japanese racism toward Koreans. It is those things and powerfully so. But the manner in while the narrative unfolds deserves experiencing even if Japanese politics of the sixties doesn't interest you.Its construction is worth your effort. It starts as a documentary of a hanging. The man is hanged but apparently survives. He has lost his identity. In order for his reexecution to be legit they have to reintroduce him to the crime. Though all the acting is done in the execution room by the executioners including a doctor lawyer and Christian priest the viewer enters shifting imaginations and we are taken on a series of conversions.At one end the beginning we have the execution witnesses following the reenactors from scene to scene the reenactors executioners taking roles in the drama. The scenes become more real until the murder where an executioner gets carried away and kills an innocent woman.Then things shift more radically and all sorts of complex folds appear simultaneously. Some viewers can see and others not. The murdered girl comes out of her coffin to become a competitor to write what we see combination lover writer and sister shifting from Japanese to Korean.You need to ignore the preaching because it gets in the way. Perhaps the second time around pay attention to it  it maps quite well onto America and its blacks though there's far less brutality length of history and institutionalized racism in the US case. But as I say this all has less value than the way the thing is put together.While watching this you will notice that the steps of narrative shifting are of different types radically different types  as varied as you get in Citizen Kane or Annie Hall. They slip sideways in unexpected directions. But the shifts occur at roughly the same frequency and seem at about the same distance.This narrative shifting does serve the political agenda in part because that agenda is simple. Something that seems invisible in one maturely rationalized perspective become obvious when the perspective is shifted a bit away from all the storied protections.I think I'm putting this on my list of essential films. Ted's Evaluation  4 of 3 Every cineliterate person should experience this.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with a documentary style look at a Japanese execution chamber. An unseen narrator explains that the vast majority of people still support the death penalty before the image shifts across a prison to the death camber itself. This chamber looks old fashioned quaint even both from the interior and exterior. As the building seems so archaic it's almost hard to imagine that people are actually brought there to die. One doesn't have to imagine however since the execution ritual is quickly and efficiently carried out as soon as the viewer is acquainted with the setting. Everything goes smoothly in this case except for one thing the guilty man is certainly hanged but he continues to live.After a brief recuperation R the condemned man awakens with a strong case of amnesia. The confused officials quickly reveal themselves as fools without the ability to react critically. They are determined to execute this man again but they won't feel right about it until he remembers who he is and why this is happening to him. The rest of the film consists of various people helping R regain the memories of who he is and how he got into this situation. The actions of the various people are often comically absurd as they attempt reenactments of various parts of R's life including his childhood in a slum reserved for inferior Koreans and the murders he has been convicted of. It's often a funny film but the subject matter is too serious for it to be seen as anything but the blackest of comedies.This is very much a social issues film for ardent leftist director Nagisa Oshima and several issues are dealt with including capital punishment of course nationalism racism violence against women and the postwar lives of war criminals. There is never any doubt which side Oshima is on for any of these issues the film is unsubtle if not downright didactic. Still Oshima's prodigious talent as a filmmaker greatly increase the effectiveness of this film and many of these issues are still quite relevant all over the world today. This film is not quite as masterful as 1969's less obvious Boy but it's still a worthy of the attention of people interested in Japanese culture andor Nagisa Oshima.".

Activities by the student organizations the Zengakuren 208402339836899 and especially the Zenkyoutou 208402084938360 are readily available to readers of the writers Oe Kenzaburo and Murakami Haruki whose viewpoints differ but who give the reader a detailed account of the student movement. During these years of protest the Japanese film industry suffered a number of financial setbacks so the old guard of film directors such as Kobayashi Masaki and Kurosawa Akira rarely produced films and directors of pink films ruled the roost. However some of these directors although their films also contained sex and violence tried to produce films that had more of a message. One of the most prominent of the Japanese New Wave directors during this time period was Oshima Nagisa whose films The Man Who Left His Will on Film Violence at Noon The Ceremony etc. were quite acerbic towards the establishment. While his films are considered a bit heavyhanded by a number of film critics Oshima like Imamura Shohei was quite concerned with people belonging to the lower strata of society especially during a time period in which they were often left behind by Japan's rapid growth. In his film Death by Hanging Oshima points his camera towards Japan's Resident Korean population.Death by Hanging opens with the Narrator Oshima Nagisa asking the audience if they support the death penalty and he goes on to say that more than seventy percent of the Japanese public supports the death penalty. However he then asks the audience if they have ever seen the inside of the death chamber itself. We the viewers then receive a step by step introduction to the environs of the death chamber and we are treated to the hanging of a condemned Korean man who raped and killed two Japanese women. However there is a problem and that problem is that the body of the condemned man R refused to die. Obviously being that someone who is hanged is supposed to die the prison officials are not sure what to do. It is decided that they will hang him again after he comes to but after he does he has amnesia. Believing that it would be wrong to hang a man without knowledge of his crime the prison officials try to recreate the rape and murder scenes for R so that his memory will be revived in order for them to execute him once more. However this task is not easy.Filmed in 1968 only three years after Japan reopened relations with South Korea and ten years after thousands of Koreans were repatriated to North Korea Death by Hanging details a number of the discriminations faced by Resident Koreans during the 1960s poverty unemployment poor educational opportunities and a general sense of disdain by the Japanese populace although of course this was not universal. Death by Hanging also attempts to show the political ideologies of the Resident Koreans mainly those affiliated with North Korea in the personage of R's sister who says that R's crimes and violence in general is the only way for the Resident Koreans to fight back against Japan. However after his first execution R does not seem to still hold onto these same views. A truly bizarre film with some dark humor Death by Hanging should be watched by those who have an interest in Japanese New Wave films or minority issues in Japan".

Oshima based his Film on an actual incident in which a young Korean was accused of raping and murdering two Japanese schoolgirls one in the Film found guilty and hung Japan's method of capital punishment. When the student fails to die when hanged his executioners set about recreating the crime each official plays a part in order to prove to the young man that he is guilty. They eventually identify with the roles they have assumed. Ultimately even the film's audience is implicated in the student's death.As the Film opens a narrator asks Are you for or against the death penalty? For those in favor he goes through an explanation of what happens in the death house. As this is being given the execution of prisoner R is being played out. When R is alive more than 20 minutes after he was hung the officials are at a loss as to what to do. The hanging is halted while the officials debate and an unconscious R regains consciousness. However R does not remember who he is and the officials can't execute him unless they can once again prove to him that he is the man convicted of the rape and murder.In an attempt to convince the prisoner the officials present including officers guards and a doctor decide to reenact the crime and later R's home life. We learn that R who plays himself in the reenactments is the poor son of a deafdumb mother and alcoholic father who was kind to his younger sisters. This reenactment is suddenly stopped by one of the officials who decides it is out of place because such information was not included in the court records. The move to the recreation of the first crime committed at Komatsugawa High School. R is told how to perform the killing and he does so. . .but not fast enough. to speed things up the education officer steps in and finishes the girl off. Back on death row there is a casket containing the dead girl whom some of the officials can see and some cannot who eventually wakes up gets out of the casket and claims to be R's older sister. The education officer claims that R didn't have an older sister.The next section of the Film is taken over by R's sister who opposes capital punishment is proud of her Korean heritage and a vehement critic of Japanese imperialism. Eventually the prosecutor who cannot see her decides she is trespassing and has her hung. In the next scene she is lying in her brother's arms beneath a Japanese flag having a discussion about desire and imagination while the officials sit around them drinking and singing. R now admits he is R and the officials want to proceed however R argues that he is a different R than they hung previously. He refuses to recognize the nation's right to kill people when killing itself is wrong. The prosecutor decides to let him go but when R tries to leave he is met by a blinding light and cannot continue. He returns and allows himself to be hanged. When we see the swinging noose however it is empty. The narrator thanks the officials and audience for the participation in the execution.".

However R does not remember who he is and the officials can't execute him unless they can once again prove to him that he is the man convicted of the rape and murder.In an attempt to convince the prisoner the officials present including officers guards and a doctor decide to reenact the crime and later R's home life. We learn that R who plays himself in the reenactments is the poor son of a deafdumb mother and alcoholic father who was kind to his younger sisters. This reenactment is suddenly stopped by one of the officials who decides it is out of place because such information was not included in the court records. The move to the recreation of the first crime committed at Komatsugawa High School. R is told how to perform the killing and he does so. . .but not fast enough. to speed things up the education officer steps in and finishes the girl off. Back on death row there is a casket containing the dead girl whom some of the officials can see and some cannot who eventually wakes up gets out of the casket and claims to be R's older sister. The education officer claims that R didn't have an older sister.The next section of the Film is taken over by R's sister who opposes capital punishment is proud of her Korean heritage and a vehement critic of Japanese imperialism. Eventually the prosecutor who cannot see her decides she is trespassing and has her hung. In the next scene she is lying in her brother's arms beneath a Japanese flag having a discussion about desire and imagination while the officials sit around them drinking and singing. R now admits he is R and the officials want to proceed however R argues that he is a different R than they hung previously. He refuses to recognize the nation's right to kill people when killing itself is wrong. The prosecutor decides to let him go but when R tries to leave he is met by a blinding light and cannot continue. He returns and allows himself to be hanged. When we see the swinging noose however it is empty. The narrator thanks the officials and audience for the participation in the execution.";

Frances becomes an actress and has some strong success in New York but her refusal to bend her convictions and her outspoken but sometimes naive political expressiveness cause her difficulties especially after she accepts a Hollywood contract. Torn between newfound success and intense feelings that she does not deserve the riches and fame she gains from the phoniness of Hollywood Frances butts heads with studio executives and with her own mother who revels in Frances's fame but provides Frances no emotional support. When drunken fights and arrests derail her career Frances is sent to a psychiatric hospital with the acquiescence of her mother. What follows is a nightmare of poor treatment and psychological trauma augmented by the increasing determination of Frances's mother to control her daughter's life.";

A non conformist ahead of her time today Frances would be almost normal the Frances Farmer story is sad and infuriatingsuch a waste... the child pressured by her mother to be everything the mother wanted for herself to be a Hollywood star the ineffectual father who could have stepped in to determine a less shattering future for their daughter. How often do we see that the wrong kind of parental influence on their children can lead to disastrous results? I found Frances courageous and admirable in the face of evil and adversity. The sadness felt by the wonderfully supportive Harry York played by Sam Shepard toward the end of the movie brings tears to the eyes she has forgotten how to love but she has survived... only to die alone in 1970.

I've always admired Jessica Lange as a really good actress but she's never blown me away like some stars do. At least not until now. Now watching this 1982 movie in 2014 a bit late I know she's completely reversed my previous thoughts about her. Her performance in this picture has to be one of the most dynamic hypnotic acting stints I've ever seen by an actress. It reminded me a bit of Faye Dunaway in Network where she won the Oscar. Looking this movie up I saw that Jessica was beaten in 1982 by Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice but if ever an actress was robbed of the Oscar this performance was it. I'd urge anyone who loves acting at the highest level to watch this movie just for Jessica Lange's performance although there is also a very strong backup show by Kim Stanley as her mother. Very long at two and half hours but I couldn't take my eyes off Jessica Lange's face. It's hard to detect between when she's being charming and when she might suddenly explode. Mesmerizing.".

Courtney got married in one of her dresses and even though their baby wasn't named after her but after a male Frances they both thought of her later.

I saw all the movies starred by Frances Farmer that was possible for me to see and it makes me like her very much. Again the music of John Barry makes me cry. The Hollyood background have never been so perfect. Jessica Lange gives the right density to the drama of the girl... Oh my God how she deserved that Oscar she did'n get...";

Not knowing a lot about the actress before the release of this film I have never been sure of how factual it is I always got the feeling that the Harry York character played by Sam Shepherd was fictional but how many screen biographies are big on the facts? Sometimes facts are glossed over andor ignored for the sake of preserving or igniting drama. Whether or not this is true is for those who knew Farmer to say. I did see an interview once with Farmer's nephew ? who was very pleased with Lange's interpretation of Farmer and that is exactly why this film is worth seeing. Despite a meandering screenplay turgid direction and a feeling the movie is about 30 minutes too long this movie is worth seeing for one reason and one reason only...the riveting performance by Jessica Lange. She is in virtually every frame of this movie and makes every single moment vivid and striking and achingly real. This film should be shown to acting classes on a daily basis...maybe the best performance by an actress in a leading role during the decade of the 1980's. Not a great film but an amazing performance by a consummate actress that must be seen to be believed.".

Miss Lange's performance is hardly short of incredible and more than deserved the Oscar nomination it garnered.Graeme Clifford tells this shocking tale with the utmost assuredness never hitting the audience overly hard in fact perhaps not hard enough nor attempting to sway their opinion. The screenplay from Eric Bergren Nicholas Kazan and Christopher De Vore is even throughout and always the writers are careful to avoid bias allowing film goers to come to their own conclusions.Frances Farmer is never portrayed as a complete victim by Lange and each facet of her personality is brought to life with equal passion in this unparalleled turn. In most worthy support is Kim Stanley nominated for Best Supporting Actress whose performance as Frances' selfserving domineering mother is frighteningly efficient and convincing. Alongside her is Bart Burns as Mr. Farmer and Sam Shepherd as a young admirer who takes the wayward girl under his wing for a time. John Barry has provided a typically melodic score.Frances is certainly a movie that will disturb those who believe that insanity is more an illness than something a person can be driven to. This is truly a very discomforting look at how the human spirit can be totally crushed by tragic though changeable circumstances. An original story like this carries enough weight on its own to impart much dramatic power. Coupled with Jessica Lange's triumphant performance she literally owns this film this is doubly so.Monday June 12 1995  Video".

	schema:headline " A ScienceFiction version of Frances Farmer's life.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie skirts the line between actual iconic film and utter Mommie Dearest trainwreck. Mostly it stays on the iconic side but only barely. The film is fairly ghastly in it's depiction of the Mental Health Industry in the 40s and 50s and some of it is justified but it becomes very apparent that the production has an axe to grind an agenda to promote and accuracy be damned. As a result very very very very elaborate liberties are taken with the facts of Miss Farmer's life That's a polite way of saying they lie like crazy in this film. For instance the centerpiece of the second half of the movie is that Frances had a lobotomy. She never did. The way the scene is filmed gives us the strong implication that we're supposed to believe that her soul died in that instant though her body lingered on for several more decades. This is simply not true and I feel it's a disservice to Frances to coopt her into someone's personal propaganda war. Another instance we see her go on TV and talk about how her faith in Jesus pulled her through her hard times and again we're given the impression that the real girl is long gone she's been turned into a mere automaton. Again this isn't true she never said this she never did this it's all made up. The movie is at least a halfhour too long and it's very biased. I will say that Jessica Lange is brilliant in the movie however and fans will be impressed her tour de force here is clearly the high water mark of her career. In the end though this movie is not even remotely a real biography it's a 90 fictional 'decline and fall' story with an axe to grind watch it with caution.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll stand by my original review as I walked out of a theater in NYC when I was 21years old after watching this film in 1982. I recall as if yesterday my sister asked What did you think? I was actually angry..since I'd practically memorized the booksShadowlands as well as Frances Farmer's own 'autobiography' which has since been largelycredited to have been written by her partner Jean Ratcliffe. I replied Frances Farmer spent her whole career fighting against the phoniness of Hollywoodand this film is an insult to her memory since hardly ANY of this ever happened! Jessica Lange doubtlessly gives a stunning performance. But WHY ALL THE LIES? The completely madeup character played by Sam Shepard Harry York was created out of wholecloth. The whole POINT of Frances Farmer's real life was that she had no one on her side! Why did they add this romantic interest who keeps popping up out of nowhere whenever Frances needs a friend? It's ludicrous and completely taints this essentially false film. As if the Frances Farmer story itself wasn't dramatic enough?! The script in fact is remarkably poor one of the credited writers is the son of Elia Kazan too. They add all these false notes that never happenedyet they leave out actual moments from Farmer's life such as how she picked up an inkwell and threw it at the judge of her trial which WOULD have added drama to the story. There are some glaringly shoddy performances too a completelyoveracted performance by the guy who plays the fictionalized version of Frances' actual husband Leif Ericson Dick Steelehe's allowed to sail straight over the top making a meal out of the scenery in his only real scene. And sorry but I think Kim Stanley's hambone performance as Mother Lillian is pretty false too though fulldisclosure I don't really like her in anything. The direction by firsttime director Australian Graeme Clifford is sloppy and strikes false notes at nearly every turn. But back to Jessica Lange In certain shots it is uncanny how she physically resembles Frances Farmer. She's often said that she felt as if Farmer actually inhabited her while making this film. I only wish she'd had the clout when making this film to rail against bad writing like Frances Farmer did against the writers of a thirdrate scripts like this...to get the quality biopic Farmer deserves.".

It follows her stormy relationship with her mother Kim Stanley and her wrongful institutionalizations.I've read Farmer's autobiography Will There Ever Be A Morning and this movie plays hard and loose with the facts. It throws in Harry York Sam Shepard a totally fictional character and make him the narrator. It also gives Farmer a love interest which isn't needed. It also has her hating the 1936 movie Come and Get Itin reality she loved that film. It does show correctly how badly she was treated in Hollywood but REALLY drops the ball when she in an institution. The book goes into gruesome and harrowing detail over how she and other inmates were treatedthe movie cuts it down to maybe 15 minutes. Also they sanitize it a lot. And the lobotomy shown never happenedshe did not spend the rest of her life as some zombie. So as a factual biography of Farmer its WAY off base.As a movie it's not too great either. It's flatly directed and the story skips around all over the place. Also Farmer's selfdestructive tendencies are never really exploredfar too much time is spent working on her relationship with York. On the plus side there are impressive recreations of 1930s and 40s New York and Hollywood.What makes this worth seeing is the acting. No one is bad but Lange and Stanley are just superb both were nominated for Oscars for this. Stanley plays the loving caring mother role to the hiltyou see the darkness in her that she tries to cover up. Lange just explodes in this one. She later said playing Frances almost killed heryou can tell! Her screaming and rage comes roaring off the screen as well as her confusion and vulnerability. A truly great performanceshe deserved the Award for this not Tootsie.So it's worth seeing for the acting but don't look for a factual bio on Farmer. For that read her book. I give this a 7.".

The main appeal of this film was its ability to assault the viewer with pieces of hilarious wit that seemingly come from nowhere and features an amazing 80's soundtrack including the cure undertones and new order. Its main downers however is a host of other actors that don't really get the attention they deserve such as the room mates that seemed to be quite interesting characters and even the female lead was given less of a personality and more of a distant that girl you view from afar who you may or may not get at the end of the movie and she wasn't necessarily poorly acted I just felt there could have been more development to her. But other than that the film was filled with witty and somewhat realistic situations that you could compare with to some extent which added to that air of authenticity that the good ol' British movie is good for. 8 stars for acting writing great soundtrack and well shot. 2 stars for less character development and being somewhat predictable near the climax.".

Just as director Tom Vaughan did in introducing the film let's get the explanation of the title out of the way. The plot centers around a group of university students competing on University Challenge a popular UK quiz show in which the host begins by announcing Starter for Ten... The American equivalent would be I'll take Famous Armadillos for 20 Alex. Now that we're set in place let's get set in time.This is a period piece  1985 to be exact. And make no mistake about it  the filmmakers went all out to recreate the mid80's  sets costumes hair and most importantly for this writer anyway the music. And oh what great songs. That had me from the word go. Finally we need a protagonist. One who is captivating enough to command 90 minutes of our time. And this is perhaps the crowning achievement of this film. His name is James McAvoy and he had no less than three films screening in Toronto this year. Talk about prolific. Though a bit older than the character Brian Jackson he's convincing as a teenager off to discover himself and of what he is capable in school life and affairs of the heart. He wins us over because he commands the screen and the script and has the eyes of innocence and vulnerability with which we can all identify. He is everyman  every boyman  and no doubt we see our own comingofage through his eyes. Throw all those elements together with a compelling love story and you have a formula for success. I asked McAvoy after the screening what his most difficult scene was. Without giving anything away I'll just say that he becomes emotional at times and quite convincingly. He told me that he had to keep reminding himself that it was Brian who was sad not James. That's powerful stuff. This is a sweet moving film which left me wanting more. I'll take Starter for Ten and I think you will too.".

Starter For Ten actually manages to get better. Although nominally about qualifying to be on the TV famous game show the film is really a lighthearted comingofage drama set in the 80s.

This enjoyable nobrainer of a movie is aided and abetted by a blistering 80s soundtrack with bands such as The Cure Psychedelic Furs Buzzcocks Yazoo The Smiths Tears for Fears The Undertones  and Kate Bush.Starter for Ten is not searing drama but it does make a pleasant and worthwhile trip down nostalgia lane. The characters are ones we can love and care about and the movie mostly avoids predictability and cheese. If the most important questions in life are the ones we already know the answer to and are not exactly rocket science the subject matter of Starter For Ten is a welcome and unpretentious antidote to the plethora of similar American teen comedies.

He has a habit of blowing it and the best is yet to come.I actually sought out this film because I am a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch. Here Cumberbatch plays the fastidious nerdy head of the College Quiz team even though they keep losing and he's hilarious. When he gets into a fight with one of Brian's friends from home the guy punches him and Cumberbatch's response is to start flapping his hands on him as if he's shaking out a dishtowel.The acting in this film is very good and it's interesting to see that all these young people have come up together. Cumberbatch and Eve are in the upcoming Star Trek Rebecca Hall and Cumberbatch starred in the miniseries Parade's End and McAvoy of course has had a marvelous career making a splash in films right around the time this film was released. The supporting cast is led by the wonderful Lindsay Duncan and Charles Dance as Alice's parents and Catherine Tate as Brian's mother.While Starter for 10 is a little predictable it has a nice quality about it and gives one a feel for university life leaving home meeting new people and the adjustments that need to be made.".

But this is a sweet touching and most of all funny film.Starter for Ten relies heavily on the charm and comedy of the characters in the film to carry it over a fairly weak plot but seeing as the outcome is such a cheerful and good natured film i have no complaints! My own favourite character was Patrick the ohso serious leader of the team but all of the cast were strong and the characters all likable in their own ways.S.for.Ten left me with a big smile on my face a silly feel good British comedy which doesn't take itself too seriously. Enjoy!".

	onyx:emotionText "I really really enjoyed this film. No it wasn't an indepth gritty drama probing the dark side of the mundane nor did it hold any strong political or social message. But this is a sweet touching and most of all funny film.Starter for Ten relies heavily on the charm and comedy of the characters in the film to carry it over a fairly weak plot but seeing as the outcome is such a cheerful and good natured film i have no complaints! My own favourite character was Patrick the ohso serious leader of the team but all of the cast were strong and the characters all likable in their own ways.S.for.Ten left me with a big smile on my face a silly feel good British comedy which doesn't take itself too seriously. Enjoy!";

The film largely stands or falls on the performance of James McAvoy best known for his role in Shameless. He fails utterly to carry this film lacking either the wit or humility to play a genuine loser. The fact he's about ten years to old for the role does rather grate as well. The plot unwinds at such a predictable rate you can watch the signposts go past and the resolution is so obvious it's like walking round your living room for 90 minutes.

Bits are OK but it never all adds up. James McEvoy's character seems like something out of the sixties being platonically hot for blonde totty that prefers a bit of rough! And the best gag he has gets lost as we all ogle a naked Lindsay Duncan in better shape than Traffik who appears in a part along with Charles Dance that seems totally superfluous to the plot and rest of film. Dominic Cooper's roughcast failure tries but gets lost in sentimentality and a direct replication of Joe Gargery in 'Great Expectations.' Harvey Cumberbatch is mediocre sitcom socalled comic relief and the University Challenge element is forgettable and really not required except as a metaphor for the socalled great theme of the film  it's alright knowing the answers but what do the questions mean eg life? Great it was not set at Oxbridge and there are a number of nice scenes and good performances from the two young female leads but it does not add up to much more than a small BBC telemovie to be hidden away in the schedules!".

And the best gag he has gets lost as we all ogle a naked Lindsay Duncan in better shape than Traffik who appears in a part along with Charles Dance that seems totally superfluous to the plot and rest of film. Dominic Cooper's roughcast failure tries but gets lost in sentimentality and a direct replication of Joe Gargery in 'Great Expectations.' Harvey Cumberbatch is mediocre sitcom socalled comic relief and the University Challenge element is forgettable and really not required except as a metaphor for the socalled great theme of the film  it's alright knowing the answers but what do the questions mean eg life? Great it was not set at Oxbridge and there are a number of nice scenes and good performances from the two young female leads but it does not add up to much more than a small BBC telemovie to be hidden away in the schedules!";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a really nice film. I have just seen it for the 4th time. Set in 1985 it begins however when Brian is younger. Sat in front of the the TV with his Mum and Dad watching University Challenge. It sets up exactly what sort of person Brian is and what he wants to become. Mark Gatiss has an astonishing likeness to presenter Bamber Gascoine in these scenes that it seems you are watching the actual show! Action soon moves to '85 and we learn that Brian's Dad had passed away 9 years earlier. It is here where the great soundtrack kicks in. Alright a few of the songs came out after 1985 but we won't quibble too much about that. There are some great songs throughout the film from the likes of The Smiths Echo  The Bunnymen Tears For Fears New Order The Undertones The Style Council and many more. There are at least four songs by The Cure too. All of which work well in the film. I very much like the allusion to how terrible it would be to become the sort of person who plays Kate Bush then we here Brian listening to her very softly in scene on New Years Eve with Rebecca.James Corden makes a brief appearance once or twice in the film. Dominic Cooper's journey as Spencer and how it affects other people plays well. Catherine Tate even though she is only a few years older than James McAvoy in reality comes across as a very lovely character in playing Brian's Mum. A special mention also to the wonderful Bendedict Cumberbatch who shines as the bitter obnoxious yet likable Patrick. His journey is more subtle in the film but he becomes a better person too.Rebecca Hall and Alice Eve play ironically Rebecca and Alice and here is the great subtleness of this film. Alice comes over very sweet and you find yourself loving her character to begin with. She is the archetypal blonde bombshell. She is however clever enough to answer the good questions on the quiz team and once again that is the subtleness of the film. McAvoy isn't your typical geek and Eve isn't your typical dumb blonde. Her character plays out as a bit of a reckless sexual and fickle girl but very intelligent. You can't help being drawn to her in certain parts of the film. Rebecca is your alternative political activist sensible thinking and i must say very very attractive girl. Both in natural beauty intelligence and personality. You again find yourself falling for her as well but for different better reasons!!! This by the way was Hall's first feature film.The film follows the trials and tribulations of sorting a team for the filming of University Challenge Brian's rising yearning for Alice then Rebecca then Alice again. His studies suffer and he seems to get lost on his journey.Without going into too much detail when Brian returns from Alice after the debacle of staying for New Year he meets up with Rebecca and the scene when it is approaching midnight and with only two minutes to go she asks him how they can waste time as they sit side by side on his bed the tenderness and beauty of her approach to kiss him and how they kiss is really touching and feels very real.There are so many moments that are really lovely in this film like the importance of Brians' Dad's jacket to Brian his learning curve about who he is and his journey to name just a few. The moment on the date with Alice when he cries talking about his Dad on original viewing was a emotional moment but having recently lost my Mother i found this now very upsetting yet beautifully played. The song The Hurting by Tears For fears works perfectly as Brian makes the earth shattering mistake with the question near the end of the film. His shame and how he feels is really emphasised by that song. A great choice.The message of the film is as simple as this No matter what mistakes you have made it is what you do next that matters. You can't lock yourself away forever when you make a mistake or something bad happens. Having been struggling with grief lately i gained the realisation that this is happening to me. It made me realise that the only person that can put things back on track is me! It is funny how life experience can alter you feelings towards a film and can change what affect it has to you on later viewings.Once Brian having shut himself away for a long while faces his demons and returns to Bristol University the first thing he does is search out Rebecca. Bumping into Alice on the way he quickly tells her it is not her he is looking for. Then when he find Rebecca and they talk the sincere way he asks if she can forgive him for all his mistakes the way she tells him he already knows the answer to that and the wonderful way they kiss once again is just so beautiful. I have to say is one of the the most beautiful kisses i have ever seen on film. The way they are pressing themselves into once another and the way their lips touch and the gorgeous smile Rebecca gives as they kiss is really moving. It is like no one else matters and no one else is around them even though they are surrounded by hundreds of people.This is a great feel good movie. It won't blow you away but it will make you smile. A film i will watch again and again. Perhaps in a year it may have even more profound effect on me when i am back on the road of my journey.".

	schema:reviewBody "University Challenge is a longrunning quiz show on British television featuring contests between teams from different universities. The title of this film is taken from the catch phrase your starter for ten.. much used by the programme's original presenter Bamber Gascoigne. I have an interest to declare as in the early eighties I myself appeared on the programme as a member of the team from Magdalene College Cambridge. I am also familiar with Bristol University as during the mideighties the film is set in 19856 my then girlfriend Melissa was a student there.There has been a long literary tradition in Britain of novels about university life although this has not always been reflected by the British cinema. There seem to be more films set in public schools Goodbye Mr Chips The Guinea Pig If.. and the two Browning Versions are all examples. The opening scenes of Chariots of Fire were set in Cambridge and those of the recent Brideshead Revisited in Oxford although in neither case is academic life the real subject of the film. Starter for Ten is one of the few British films Lucky Jim is another to take university life as its main subject matter. The subject has been much more extensively treated in American films.In form the film is a romantic comedy. The main character is Brian Jackson a workingclass boy from Clacton a seaside resort in Essex who wins a place at the prestigious Bristol University. From his childhood Brian has had a passion for knowledge and learning for its own sake and this earns him a slot on Bristol's University Challenge team. The romance element is provided by the two girls in Brian's life Alice and Rebecca who have very different personalities. The blonde Alice a fellowmember of the quiz team is sexy and glamorous but also shallow and fickle and wildly promiscuous. Or at least she claims to be wildly promiscuous there is perhaps a hint that her stories of having slept with just about every man who has ever crossed her path were invented to impress the easilyimpressed Brian. The brunette Rebecca is less obviously glamorous although the actress who plays her is in fact very attractive but more sincere and genuine than Alice like Brian she has an interest in leftwing politics.Politics in fact play an important role in this film. Brian and Rebecca are seen demonstrating in favour of various fashionable eighties causes antiapartheid nuclear disarmament etc. but even more important are the politics of social class. The workingclass Brian often feels out of his depth among the more affluent students at Bristol such as Alice and Patrick the captain of the quiz team who is played as a stuffy pompous snob. Brian feels the need to remain in touch with his proletarian roots especially his old school friend Spencer who cautions him not to become a wnker by which he presumably means someone like Patrick. This however was one of the weakest aspects of the film. It is Spencer who is the real wnker an unpleasant and dishonest character who sleeps with his mate's girlfriend and shamelessly confesses to benefit fraud and embezzling from his employer. Indeed in the first scene in which he appears he throws a tape belonging to another boy into the sea for no reason other than sheer devilment. I therefore found it rather disquieting and patronising to all those who had to struggle with the problem of being unemployed during the eighties that the scriptwriters seemed to treat Spencer as a workingclass hero and the voice of Brian's social conscience.Some of the characters Alice Spencer and above all Patrick were rather clichd and onedimensional but James McAvoy was good as Brian an engaging and very believable mixture of intellectual precocity and naivety even though at twentyseven he seemed physically too mature to be playing an eighteenyearold. This was not however his best performance that must be either Atonement or The Last King of Scotland. The comedienne Catherine Tate gave a nicely judged performance as Brian's widowed mother and Rebecca Hall made Rebecca a likable heroine even though she was a bit too intense for my tastes. Mark Gatiss gave a pitchperfect imitation of Bamber Gascoigne even though in real life there is no physical resemblance between them. There were some very comic moments especially Brian's disastrous visit to Alice and her seriously weird parents the sort of people who walk round naked in front of guests but can be surprisingly uptight in other ways.Much of the appeal of the film at least for me lies in its nostalgic recreation of the eighties featuring not only the political causes of the era but also its fashions and hairstyles and above all its pop music even if some of the songs we hear were not released until after the date when the film is set. There are some similarities with The History Boys another film made in 2006 and also set in an educational establishment in that case a grammar school during the mideighties. Dominic Cooper who plays Spencer here also appeared in The History Boys. I don't think Starter for Ten is quite as good as The History Boys in which scriptwriter Alan Bennett combined an often brilliant wit with some serious themes and sharp social observation but it is an often amusing and generally enjoyable look at the Age of Thatcher. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "I went last night to see Starter For Ten a British based film with the excellent young up and coming actor James McVoy.Not an awful film but not as clever as it would like to be I did like it I just felt it was trying to be more than it was. It felt like the writers were trying to be Richard Curtis but failing with the actual cleverness of his writing timing and general script play.The title is taken from the well known in the UK University Challenge and a young lad who always wants more knowledge and generally dreams of better things for himself an opening gambitEver since I can remember I've wanted to be clever. Some people are born clever same way some people are born beautiful.

It felt like the writers were trying to be Richard Curtis but failing with the actual cleverness of his writing timing and general script play.The title is taken from the well known in the UK University Challenge and a young lad who always wants more knowledge and generally dreams of better things for himself an opening gambitEver since I can remember I've wanted to be clever. Some people are born clever same way some people are born beautiful.

I love the genre and had never heard of the actors before this film so I had no personal bias against any of them. But every minute of watching it made me feel cheated out of that 60 seconds.This was the first I'd seen of James McAvoy who I'll admit has never done a movie I've liked I think Wanted is one of the three worst superhero movies I've ever seen and I did want to like him and his character. But all I wanted to do was slap him hard and repeatedly.Every teen in the film is a glaring clich but mostly from mainstream films. Maybe the idea was to fill an arthouseaimed title with such clichs in hopes that few members of its audience patronized mainstream teen fare and therefore wouldn't be aware of all the contrivances. But even if you haven't seen a teen romantic comedydrama since Footloose you're sure to pick up on many of the components of the standard highconcept formula of Working class good guy misguided into falling for wealthy selfcentered beauty discovers her shortcomings and his own in the process realizes that uglyducklingturnedswan is who he should really care about etc. As for the device that drives the hackneyed plot it's a highminded TV trivia competition for university coeds rather than a sporting event but otherwise all the usual ingredients are here. Somehow though they manage to work even more poorly in this film than in many Hollywood fluff pieces.Again this critique is a lot more visceral than intellectual but much as I hate to borrow from Roger Ebert I really really really HATED this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ein Stck vom Himmel is a German 90minute movie from 1958 and already almost 58 years old by now already. It's a fairly harmless movie with lots of romance some decent comedy and a little pint of drama as well. It has quite a few sweet sequences and also made me laugh a couple times. I liked the early quote about gentlemen and Marylin Monroe. The humor may seem a bit odd but lets not forget when this was made and it is still better than what many romantic comedies are trying to sell us these days especially these incredibly cheesy German ones.The film is directed by Rudolf Jugert actually pretty prolific from the 1950s to 1970s. The male lead character is played by Toni Sailer looks a bit like famous trumpeter Stefan Mross. When he made this film he had already retired from skiing. But he won several Olympic gold medals and world championships before. This film was his start into an actually successful acting career that lasted many decades. Georg Thomalla he would have turned 100 this year delivers the comedic parts and he does greatly so. lots of talent he has. Needless to say he is not related to Simone. In contrast to Sailer he was very experienced when this movie was made and had already acted for 20 years roughly. Another strength of this film is that it was actually really easy to keep the characters apart. I sometimes struggle with that especially in old movies but it's really no problem here.The girls in this film are all really goodlooking and talented actresses. The seemingly final meeting of the two main characters was pretty moving but also very sweet how they interacted with each other for example if they were supposed to say du or Sie. And it was kinda sad that he had to leave for another country soon. You could easily feel for the characters which is probably the most essential thing in romance movies and so many fail in that regard and I was happy when they got together in the end. Of course it was very much expected but it was beautiful nonetheless.So finally I recommend watching this film. It's not mindblowing in any regard but it's a sweet little comedy and you may even get to see the young Horst Buchholz before his rise to stardom if you look closely.".

Needless to say the comedic sequences are over the top which is to be expected in a movie lead by Sacha Baron Cohen but I found most of it hilarious even overall funnier than 'Borat'. At the same time the film touches on some relevant issues for example when Brno visits the gay converters or when he has parents audition for him to take a photograph with his kid.

When Brno puts himself in various situations and some dangerous situations and finds himself speechless it almost makes you think that Sascha Baron Cohen couldn't possibly come up with any semblance of a clever retort. But exactly at those times is when he wows you with his virtuosolike skill of improvisation. If I wasn't when I saw Borat I am now completely convinced that Cohen is a genius. I highly recommend watching the DVD for its alternate deleted and extended scenes and a highly pertinent interview with Brno's unknowing agent after the fact. I highly recommend this movie if for his skill at making a story into the various peoples he meets.".

	schema:reviewBody "Granted the DVD I rented began to skip about halfway through the film and I didn't see the whole movie I believe that the only reason that this movie doesn't get the same reviews as Borat is because the American audience is too uptight. Yes the movie is gross and at times cringeinducing. Some of the more extreme scenes could have been hampered down but I believe at the expense of the humor. Posters say they have never met anyone like Bruno however have they ever met anyone like Borat. Neither exist in the real world and that is why the movie works. Cohen is a brilliant improviser and always two steps ahead of his targets. Some of the pranks don't deliver but that's okay. I admire his audacity. For all the people who say it was too gross imagine if the film was filled with explicit heterosexual sex I'm sure the reaction would be much different. The aversion to this movie is primarily because there is a deep seated disgust to homosexual activity within the American psyche and even the most tolerant liberal is likely to be disgusted at some point. That's okay that is why the movie works it asks us what it is and why we are appalled.".

The humour in the film is clearly that of inyourface slapstick however given the extremes the film goes to it's all relatively entertaining. Like Borat all of the genuine laughs are in everyday peoples reactions rather than the poorly structured story or scripted scenes.That said it was a challenge of how much one could handle and I wouldn't have minded if they had left out a particular full frontal shot of the male anatomy spinning around an image that will stay with me for some time and probably haunt my dreams. It's not a movie I could really get 'comfortable' with watching seeing all hell unravel in a variety of situations one after another with very little in the way of breaks but time did go by relatively quickly which helps given the intensity of the scenes.It's not a film for the faint of heart and definitely has more potential to offend than Borat ever did though for the more open minded among us who aren't so easily offended you may find some enjoyment in this film. Humanities finest moments certainly aren't on display here. Go see it with a few mates or drinking buddies and have fun though you may exit the cinema a little more disturbed than when you went in.".

	schema:reviewBody "Satire has been defined as stretching a position to its logical conclusion in order to expose its absurdity for example Jonathan Swift suggesting that the starving Irish should show initiative by fattening up their children and selling them to welltodo families as food. The brilliant satirist Sacha Baron Cohen in Larry Charles' Bruno takes the story of a Gay Austrian fashionista seeking to become a celebrity in the U.S. and stretches it to its logical conclusion and then extends it  way beyond. It is often hard to tell if the film is an expos of the debasement of our culture or just another of example of it.In the film a sequel to the 2006 megahit Borat Bruno comes to Los Angles to become host of his own AList Celebrity Max Out after being fired from his job as a TV host of the Austrian show Funkyzeit and being schwartzlisted. Needless to say it maxes out after the first viewing thanks to an abortive interview with Paula Abdul and Harrison Ford. Not letting a temporary setback stand in his way Bruno hires an assistant named Lutz Gustaf Hammarsten and travels far and wide in an elusive search for the American Dream known as fame and fortune. In his stunts and misadventures mostly in the South and Southwest he exposes the raw prejudices that exist against gays and the sickening cult of celebrity that grips us as a nation.The funniest scenes are at a swinger's party on a Dallas talk show at a gay deprogramming session during a visit to a psychic where Bruno mimes oral sex and the spectacle of a drunken crowd stirred up by scared straight Bruno bashing gays in a fightclub arena. Seeking to become recognized world wide Bruno travels to the Middle East to try and bring the Arabs and the Israeli's together but confuses Hamas with Hummus and the only thing they can agree on is that it is good with pita bread. In another sequence he goes to Africa to swap his iPod for a little black child named OJ which he uses to crash American talk shows. Baron Cohen who wrote the script with Anthony Hines Dan Mazer and Jeff Schaffer saves his heavy artillery for narrow mindedness of every stripe.The film ridicules all it comes in contact with sparing nothing and nobody  from exhibitionist gays to uptight straights to families who will starve their children for a modeling gig. Some sequences hit their targets others do not. If you are looking for good taste you will not find it here. While satire in film is not supposed to be a comfortable experience and is supposed to make you squirm and even at times hide your eyes it is not supposed to make you want to walk out.Bruno travels a thin line between what's merely outlandish and what is revolting and its in your face shamelessness comes awfully close to defeating its own purpose. The fact that the Cambridgeeducated Cohen is ultimately able to pull it off however and make it entertaining is a tribute to his courage and originality. While Bruno can be shocking and very disturbing it is also a mirror for us to look at ourselves. Like the est training of the 1970s that was often confrontational we may not like what we see but we can use it to grow from the experience.".

Obviously having made Borat the producers of Brno had a hard time to repeat the surprise effect.

Still confrontations with a number of people among which a few famous ones seem sincere and work on multiple levels as in Borat. Others are clearly scripted but not less funny for that watch the ending credits for an example.In general compared to Borat Brno focuses more on a effectively shocking it's viewers with the sexual misconduct of the main character and b stunts of this main character in front of a large audience. Essentially this time the shock effect is moved from the 'random' people that appear in the movie to the audience looking at the movie.For many it will definitely be more shocking than Borat given the shamelessly explicit content that exploits every possibility for jokes concerning men making out. For others the neverending provoked racism of Borat will have a longerlasting impact.All I know is that I laughed a lot during this movie. It will once again lead to lots of controversy and imitation at thousands of workplaces around the globe. Maybe it is therefore best if you know what it is about.But be warned.

After seeing the trailer for Brno I don't think I even need to say this everyone wanted to see where Sacha would go after Borat and Brno looked like an incredibly funny movie. I consider myself a liberal person I don't mind the shock humor of today but my problem with this movie is that it's hurting more than harmless humor. I have a few homosexual friends who are struggling to be taken seriously in life and this movie is honestly setting them back. My thing is that if Sacha had a message in the film vs. just mocking not just a country but other people the film would have worked a lot better.Gay Austrian fashion reporter Brno is fired from his show after disrupting a catwalk show during Fashion week. Accompanied by his assistant's assistant Lutz he travels to the United States to become a superstar. After a pilot of a celebrity interview show bombs with a test audience he attempts to become famous via various other methods. In an attempt to create a sex tape he arranges an interview with Ron Paul and while the two wait for a staged technical problem to be fixed Brno starts hitting on Paul. He consults PR consultants to select a world problem he can tackle to maximize his fame with a minimum of effort. He flies to Jerusalem where he interviews former Mossad agent Yossi Alpher and Palestinian politician Ghassan Khatib in which Brno asks silly questions and gets kicked out of the country. On a TV talk show hosted by Richard Bey he shows the African American audience a Black baby named O.J. whom he acquired in Africa by swapping him for an iPod. The audience is appalled. Social Services take the boy away from Brno driving him into severe depression. After realizing that the biggest names in Hollywood are straight Brno consults two Christian gay converters to become heterosexual.Brno is Borat with a different character it seems like Sacha is just relying on shock over actual humor now. Although I'm actually curious what the unrated DVD is going to look like because this might as well have been a porno. For God's sake they have a scene that Brno goes to a swinger's party and there is just full frontal back side everything you can imagine in a porno is in this scene. Not to mention there's a sex scene in the beginning with Brno and his boyfriend that is just plain disturbing that involves a bike connected to a dildo that pleasures Brno while his boyfriend exercises and it's a bit much for most to handle. Then Brno speaks to a gay converter to become straight that was just over the top offensive not just from Brno's lines but also the leader of this group who clearly is hiding behind God's skirt. Now if this is your kind of humor honestly I'm not sure if I'd want to know you because this is the humor that is more stupid and hurts people vs. just having fun. I wouldn't really recommend for people to run out and watch this trash I hate to say it Brno was too offensive and that's saying a lot from me considering that I thought Borat was hilarious.210".

After seeing the trailer for Brno I don't think I even need to say this everyone wanted to see where Sacha would go after Borat and Brno looked like an incredibly funny movie. I consider myself a liberal person I don't mind the shock humor of today but my problem with this movie is that it's hurting more than harmless humor.

	schema:headline " Better than Borat";
	schema:reviewBody "I got free tickets to an exclusive screening of Bruno last night I went in expecting to find it funny but the memories of Borat and the catchphrases that haunted me months after the movie came out still lingered. Yes I loved Borat on first viewing yes it was shocking it was original but it was brilliant. Sadly it became way way too popular and sadly the joke wore very thin by the millionth time I had heard many of the lines from the film. When Bruno was first announced I had no interest in the film. The character was good but in my opinion also very one note and lacking the comedic potential that Borat had. Yet I can safely say after watching it that it is by far one of the funniest movies in ages narrowly just above The Hangover I would say. Bruno is a hugely risky comedy and will offend many people. Yet it doesn't seem as offencive as Borat and as a result possibly funnier. This isn't to say Bruno is tame far from it. A scene with a talking penis more than sees to that also the funniest scene I have seen in many a year. But credit has to go to Sacha Baron Cohen is really is the modern day Peter Sellers. Like Sellers he has perfect comedic timing has a vast array of characters to play with and truly seems to inhabit his roles. At no point in this movie did I question that Bruno didn't exist thats how brilliantly he plays the role. Sure Bruno may grate to some viewers but he is actually a decent character. The short run time while questionably too short possibly the missing Latoya Jackson interview might have made up for this makes sure the film never outstays its welcome.Cohen truly is perfect in the movie and also a very incredibly brave man. While I question whether some scene weren't actually staged the man does seem to put himself in very risky situations. An interview with a terrorist being frighteningly realistic and the crowds reaction at the end basically coming across that he could be murdered at any second. But the key to this type of humour is the public's reactions and some members react absolutely brilliantly. The most horrifying and shocking for me being an interview with parents who want their children in show business. What they are willing to do is absolutely horrifying. I question Paula Abdul's interview not being staged but it is funny all the same. Bruno's assistant Lutz played by Gustaf Hammarsten is amusing though not as great as Borat's manager. The pair do have some great scene especially when they're locked together in a rather sexual way that is pretty damned funny.Bruno will either drive you into hysterics as it did me and everyone in the audience. Or will horrify and shock you yet as I just said it didn't appear to do so in my audience in fact unlike Borat where at least 10 people walked nobody left Bruno at all. The comedy is brilliant and while it is shocking you cannot help but laugh. It balances wincing with embarrassment with shock humour to perfection. It's an incredibly funny movie with so many memorable lines that possibly I may hate in a month because of the movies inevitable popularity and scenes that are just hilarious. My only gripe with it is the length I guess which is both a blessing and a curse for the movie. It just seems lacking a bit more tenfifteen more minutes would have been perfect in my mines just to make the movie flow that bit better. But when a movie is this funny how can you really criticise it for not falling into many comedies traps? Just running on far too long yes 40 Year Old Virgin as much as I love you I am looking at you.Overall Bruno is a must see of this summer which so far seems to be lacking in many quality movies. Anyway if you want a short sharp shock but a funny shock of a movie then Bruno is definitely for you. Just don't go with your parents!".

I mean telling you that in one scene Bruno is undergoing anal bleaching while talking to his agent in Hollywood will subtract nothing from the shock and possible hilarity of what you're going to see on screen.No there's no way anything outside of the film can ruin it. The problem lies entirely within its frames. Think of Limburger Cheese. That pungent flavor and stunning odor are its normal properties. And few people choose to eat it.When my wife and I saw it yesterday our reaction was mixed to say the least. I found myself alternately cringing and laughing my wife alternately cringed and asked me if I was ready to leave yet. For me the film's flaws were not so serious that I felt that if I ate one more piece of it I'd refund my popcorn but my wife's gag reflex was stronger and so we left the theater before the film ended.For us the most offensive aspects of Bruno did not involve the overgenerous displays of backsides and genitalia. Even when Bruno's sizable penis got blown up to an onscreen size of about 3 to 4 feet our only comment was that we were glad that the movie was not photographed in 3D.But the conceit of the film is that our society's hypocritical preoccupations with celebrity and otherpeople's sexuality make many of us fair game for gotcha exposure. Look at these fools who'll do anything to get themselves or their kids on camera! And look at these benighted doltsboth the biblethumping rednecks from the rural South and the pseudosophisticates in the coastal big cities don't they deserve to have a big manbutt wagged in their faces so we can laugh at them when they get mad? Those are the questions Bruno poses. His lack of cleverness actually made me feel sympathy for people who usually burn me up. I'm no Ron Paul fan. I find his brand of LibertarianRepublicanism to be far too conservative frankly. But Bruno's vulgar mock interview with him seemed undeserved. Dr. Paul is a decent pretty broadminded fellow. Bruno came off looking like an ignorant fool.Similarly his excruciating farcical peacemaking session with an Israeli hardliner and a representative of Hamas did nothing to point out the shortcomings of the two intransigent enemies. If it did anything it made me feel sorry for two aging politicians whose jobs require spending endless hours in boring frustrating fruitless meetings. Mr. BaronCohen seems to believe that by adding a few hours of mortification to their lives he is somehow adding something to someone's understanding of the slaughterfactory known as the Middle East.The people responsible for this film are very talented. I have enjoyed some of their other efforts. In spite of the amount of derrire shown in this movie it struck me as halfassed. You can do better guys.

	schema:reviewBody "Sacha Baron Cohen's follow up to Borat follows his gay Austrian fashionista character as he flies around the world and gets into people's faces. Often intellectually clever the film is rarely funny with any humor being dissipated in long sequences that go nowhere or into the toilet. I honestly think that the film is one grand put on by Cohen who is having it over on some of the people I think a good number of people were in on this from the start in the film and on the audience as a whole. I don't think the film is really suppose to be funny rather its an exercise of the sort that Andy Kaufman used to do where he's trying to get you to think about things. I'm not sure what we're suppose to be thinking about since Cohen's Bruno is so in your face he's more annoying than anything else. I can't help but think that much of the film was carefully set up more so than Borat and that the real reactions were scripted or at the very least stage managed. The almost final sequence where a homosexual encounter occurs at an ultimate fighting match clearly has the feel of being set up. It seems to me from how the sequence was filmed that Cohen was only out for a reaction and didn't care if the implication that the town hates gays is true or not. Frequently while watching this I kept wondering why I was still doing so. I wasn't laughing I wasn't squirming at being uncomfortable I was just bored and waiting for some grand revelation about what what it all meant. It never came. I think this is the third feature by director Larry Charles that I've found questionable in its reasoning. I'm not a fan of Boratand Religulous is intellectually dishonest. Bruno fits in with them perfectly since they are all films with good ideas and really lousy execution. I'd take a pass and wait if you must see it for cable. Actually what I suggest is go find a copy of The Magic Christian with Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr since the mental hot foot thing is done so much better there.I want to keep discussing the film and pulling it apart but I can't really find the oomph to do so since that throwing good effort after bad and giving too much weight to what is a really stupid movie.2 out of 10 because  even though its better than that at times the feeling one has when its over is that the film is too damn stupid to believe.".

But who cares?  when I want grim I'll watch a documentary I'll settle back happily any day to watch fine actors in a quiet 'little' film with gorgeous Dorset scenery it really is that beautiful visit if you can and a tender story.It will be too slow too uneventful for some. Perhaps they'd have preferred a blowsy Hollywood version where Antonio Banderas plays the farmer's son and Renee Zellwegger the upper crust beauty hooray for the ghost of a UK film industry. But I found it gentle and charming just as it was and when the ingredients are so fine to begin with that's good enough for me.

Since then though it has been praised highly by producers Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg who have since worked alongside the Director David Leland since it was released.As well as being an intimate portrait of three very different young women it also captures spectacularly the beautiful scenery of the English countryside.The plot is not too difficult to follow Three young women Stella Ag and Pru played by Catherine McCormack Rachel Weisz and Anna Friel from the towns are sent to the countryside to work on the farms as part of the Women's Land Army wherein all three at one point become involved with the young and handsome Joe played by Steven Mackintosh. The storyline is not too difficult to follow and the film easily rewards the viewer.This film may be hard to come by in some areas but do not worry if you have difficulty getting hold of it as it is likely to remain relevant and enjoyable for many years to come  a hidden gem and undoubted classic of English filmmaking.".

The funniest part was when Ag Rachel Weisz decided to lose her virginity.It was good for a story about the effects of the war on peoples lives especially their love lives but there just wasn't a lot there.Besides Weisz there was Catherine McCormack 28 Weeks Later and Anna Friel who had a bigger WWII role in The War Bride.

On the farm they find love conflict friendship and cows. The film is more of a relationship drama of those left behind than an account of the second world war.That said it is an interesting piece  not only is it different to have a WW2 film from a British pointofview but also from a woman's point of view. It is interesting to see how those left behind acted with their lives and their war efforts  how close to the truth this account is anyone's guess it's a bit unrealistic because so many girl's experiences are crammed into the story of these three. The story is good regardless with the tangled relationships creating the glut of the plot however the many tangled love stories do get a bit much at times but the themes of love loss and British spirit during wartime tend to make up for it.The performance from the lead trio are mixed Weisz is a bit stereotyped as an upperclass woman rotter jolly good etc but gets better as her character develops. Friel is good as Prue who starts as the roughest of the group but is touched by the events in her life. McCormack Stella is meant to be the core of the story with her interactions with the farmers especially the son Joe Steven Mackintosh but she plays it a little over earnest for my liking. Mackintosh has the most complex role and carries it off very well with the best performance in the film.The film's conclusion is a mix of neat tidy endings and some more emotional moments that more realistically depict the damage that the conflict caused on the people left behind.Overall the film is not amazing but is an interesting account of WW2 from a different point of view some of the events are a little stereotyped and lack a realistic feel but generally the film carries the emotions that many will have experienced at the time.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is based on the book but has been improved by the deletion of several chapters and minor characters. The best scenes and dialogue have come from the screenplay writers too.In 1941 the British government set up the Women's Land Army to encourage women to work in the factories and farms so as to release men to join the armed services. So Stella Catherine McCormack Prue Anna Friel and Ag Rachel Weisz come to the farm of John and Faith Lawrence in Dorset. All three get involved with Joe the handsome son of the Lawrences. The sex scenes are ridiculous but also hilarious and thankfully much fewer and briefer than those in the book.There are several really good scenes showing the relationship between the girls and between them and the farmers. In one Stella asks for some time off to see her fianc No growls the farmer there's too much work to be done. Stella doesn't say anything the look says it all... disappointment. Then when Stella starts the tractor up and begins to plough the special paddock we see the farmer striding towards her she looks so worried. He's going to shout at me... send me home.... But no he muses about his beloved paddock then You'd better finish it you're doing a good job. Another is when Stella sees her badly injured fianc and then has to decide whether to go back to the farm we can see her thinking... He needs me... I have to stay by him.Friel is sparkling mostly but gets the really sad scene when told her new husband has been killed and Weisz gets a great line when she meets Desmond just as he has to leave... We've only just met you couldn't possibly ask me to wait for you. He does and she does. How sweet.Near the beginning the very old farmhand in the actor's one and only film The dark one takes my fancy she reminds me of a girl I met in 1899!!! The final scene in the orchard at a postwar reunion with Stella and Joe is so poignant as they reflect on what might have been. I waited for that train for a week... I'm still waiting says Joe. Their hands touch for a second then they walk away.I rate it a 10 because I can follow the story easily I can recognise all the characters without wondering who they are or what they are doing the acting is faultless from all the cast and there are the good scenes with excellent dialogue.One tiny fault the girls arrive with suitcases that wouldn't hold a quarter of the clothes they subsequently wear!".

The movie isn't exactly a war movie but it is more of a romantic drama with WWII as an important background. Storywise the movie does remind me of 'Belle Epoque' but the treatment is very different. I liked the use of the settings. The beautiful green countryside landscape is breathtaking to watch and the characters are interesting. I liked that the sets weren't overdone because the farm and town look very real. The film has a Brit charm to it but at times the pacing is a tad too slow and I wish the writer and director added more comedy to it. The performances are solid. Catherine McCormack Rachel Weisz and Anna Friel are all brilliant as the land girls. Maureen O'Brien is very likable in a supporting role. Steven Mackintosh makes himself noticeable in a film about women. I also liked the gentle soothing soundtrack which is used with fine subtlety. Overall 'The Land Girls' makes for a decent rainy day flick and it's not bad at all for a onetime watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always love period dramas especially films that focus on women and their friendships but this movie left me wondering what the point was after two hours.  The three girls come to work on the farm with three totally separate personalities.  You have Prue the party girl Ag the uptight college girl and Stella who is supposed to be the mainstay of the entire movie the sensible one.  In fact it is Stella who narrates the movie and opens it with how she moved to the farm to help and be closer to her fiancee.  So we establish that she's committed and in love with her fiancee but within the first 30  minutes she's falling in love with the farmhand Joe even after saying how unspeakable he is for no good reason.  Worst of all the reason is never explained on how she fell out of love with her fiancee and fell in love with Joe.

	onyx:emotionText "I always love period dramas especially films that focus on women and their friendships but this movie left me wondering what the point was after two hours.  The three girls come to work on the farm with three totally separate personalities.  You have Prue the party girl Ag the uptight college girl and Stella who is supposed to be the mainstay of the entire movie the sensible one.  In fact it is Stella who narrates the movie and opens it with how she moved to the farm to help and be closer to her fiancee.  So we establish that she's committed and in love with her fiancee but within the first 30  minutes she's falling in love with the farmhand Joe even after saying how unspeakable he is for no good reason.  Worst of all the reason is never explained on how she fell out of love with her fiancee and fell in love with Joe.  And she seems to have no problem with Joe falling in love or at least in bed with everyone else around her.  The movie did not make sense to me at that point.  Still it is a quiet film with gorgeous English scenery and if you just want a movie that focuses on friendship then this is the movie for you.  I watched it once and that's enough.";

And indeed he is much more active and jumping around all over the place than in his later work. He opens and closes the film by monologuing into the camera but Turkish singer Drio Moreno is the real star of this FrenchItalian co production. Daro plays Miguel a meek man who lets his wife boss him around and has a job as at the local bank. The bank director has gambling debts and is thinking of ending it all until a stuttering thief robs the bank. However Miguel foils the attempt by putting his groceries which he kept in the safe in the bag of swag. Not to be outdone the director reports that 19 million Francs have gone missing the next day. Two bumbling police inspectors not unlike the Tintin's Dupond et DupondThompson twins are put on the case. Meanwhile Miguel's wife Viviane the equally Turkish Magali Nol has been advised by her mother to fool around a bit and goes out parading with her fur coat on the beach. This was apparently the thing to do back in 1958. She immediately catches Nando's eye who insists in taking her out to dinner. But Miguel proud of himself for foiling the bank robbery is treating himself to a fancy meal at the Magda club as well. Finding himself entranced by the dance act on stage he joins in and becomes an instant hit on account of his singing voice. As soon as Viviane  Nando arrive the viewer is treated to a well choreographed good old fashioned sequence in which husband and wife keep walking by each other without ever catching wind of each other. And even when they do they still fail to get sufficient proof or a visual confirmation.The next day Miguel is offered a job as a singer and gains a sneaky agent who takes possession of his entire salary for the first day. His sudden increase in money makes the two police inspectors suspicious of him as well as the clandestine meetings Viviane is having with Nando. At this time Nando has adopted a Marlon Brando look because of a big poster of 'The Young Lions' Viviane admired on the Boulevard. This explains why the film is known as 'The Young Lion' in Italy where Alberto Sordi naturally gets top billing while the French version takes it's title from Daro Moreno's song 'Oh! Qu Mambo'. Poor gullible Miguel ends up being torn between other people's wished. His wife plans to leave him the bank director wants him to take the blame or end his life with a gun and his agent forces him to perform at the club and in front of TV cameras or he won't give him his gun back. But needless to say goodness and niceness win out in the end as they were meant to be in a lighthearted screwball comedy of this nature. Add to that a blink and you'll miss him cameo by the great Charles Aznavour and you'll have some good old fashioned entertainment for 82 minutes.7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I got this film in a twelve pack of films that are zombie themed. This one should not have been included as there is nothing about this film that is zombie oriented. It is more mystery but that is not very true either as it is not very difficult to see where this film is going if one has seen more than a couple of horror films during their lifetime. It was somewhat interesting at first though as I was wondering what was going to be happening as I still held out hope there would be zombies or something within the film. Not so late in the film though it became apparently clear how it would end so I spent a good portion of the film continually looking at the clock counter on the DVD player hoping it would hurry up and finish. Suffice to say it was worth one look so I could properly review but not a film I would ever care to pop in the player again during my lifetime.The story has a plantation in Africa experiencing some problems. It is occupied by a mother and her two sons. One of the sons seems to be experimenting on animals while the other tries to keep the plantation together as a couple of people end up dead. This brother also has a fianc coming in from London and his mother does not approve at all. More strange things happens as the film races to its somewhat bizarre but thoroughly predictable ending.The movie was just dull as I said it started out interestingly enough as a man works on a monkey but then there are just a lot of dead scenes that really add nothing to the plot. As the movie progresses it becomes less and less interesting as it is so obvious what is going on so all you are waiting for at this point is the ending to pop up. Thankfully it did finally come on screen and I was more than happy to eject it and put it away. That being said it is not terrible as the acting is decent just to dull and predictable a story for my tastes.".

His aristocratic family run a farm in South Africa where the other son Burns is set to marry his English lass Field much to the chagrin of his fiercely protective mother Inglis. A series of strange murders and rituals force Field to reconsider her commitment as the enigma of the demented brother locked away in the upper floor of the family mansion becomes too much for her to ignore.It's pure tripe wasting Field's considerable talents and those of supporting actor Oxley as a concerned doctor whom Field befriends on the journey from England. Initially an affable character Burns quickly becomes an arrogant aristocrat and borderline Oedipus complex to mother Inglis who plays the family matriarch with all the usual pomp you'd expect. It's a relatively small cast lacking depth and familiarity beyond the three leads Burns Field and Oxley.While the twist ending might leave some surprised the revelations are lost potential poorly executed and lacking suspense or thrills. Austin's movie relies on oldfashioned motifs like the club footed nut jobs who only come out at night and play the pipe organ witchdoctors proffering sinister incantations that no one believes and chemical experiments that involve dozens of test tubes filled with colourful smoky potions that make monkeys go berserk. Worse than dull it promises a great revelation then fails to deliver.".

While the cast seemed to all be English the terrain and deep blue sky seemed somewhat foreign so I was interested to learn afterwards that this is a South African production. It's a pretty rare thing to find a horror movie from that country and this was probably the most interesting thing about this one. It's another costume horror of which there were many back at the time this was released. Set in the 19th century it centres on a young woman who travels to the plantation home of her fianc whose family has a grim history. The mother tries to encourage her to leave while the other brother is an unseen lunatic in the attic. As is so often the way a series of murders start happening. But are they a result of voodoo? Is it mad science at work? Or is this the work ofa horse!? All is eventually revealed.The combination of a hokey mad scientist plotline with traditional voodoo is slightly unusual. As is the way that animals are sometimes presented with a major character being what can only be described as a socalled devil horse which the locals actually believe could be roaming around in the dead of night committing all the killings. The science bit is covered by the not entirely interesting idea of human soul transferal. So the story has quite a few disparate ideas kicking about and there is undoubtedly some potential in the setup but the presentation is often quite meandering and uneventful. But it's overall actually not bad really as there is some atmosphere generated in some of the night scenes depicting strange goings on and there is a quite well executed chase scene involving a hooded villain too. The South African setting adds something new as well which definitely elevates the material by itself. As I say it doesn't always maximise its ideas and it is a bit messy but it does also have a lively ending to round things off. All things considered despite a few faults this one is definitely better than its reputation would suggest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves.  Among the more prominent we have Officer and a Gentleman' Top Gun' GI Jane' and now Men of Honor'.  The fact that this one happened to be true doesn't change the fact that the formula is the same.  This film is probably most like GI Jane' since it focuses on the desegregation angle.The story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best humaninterest story among those mentioned above.  Carl Brashear Cuba Gooding Jr. is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film. Unfortunately director George Tillman has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than Brashear in favor of showing Brashear in a constant state of adversity. Billy Sunday Robert De Niro is a central figure and except for the initial scene the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife we don't know much about him.  For instance Brashear sees the scars on Sunday's palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow but there is no followup on that point.  Mr. Pappy Hal Holbrook gets only one short scene by which we can judge him.  The rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting.  If a director is going to make a humaninterest story he needs to humanize the characters.Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an outstanding performance as Brashear.  This is probably the best I've seen him.  This is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before and he rises to the occasion.  In Jerry Maguire' Rod Tidwell was a fascinating but onedimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle.  Brashear is much more complex and grounded and the issues he faces are life crises making the part far more challenging.  This is an excellent recovery from Gooding's last role in Chill Factor' a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the part.After a stint trying his hand as a comedian Analyze This' The Adventures of Rocky  Bullwinkle' Meet The Parents' Robert DeNiro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance.  DeNiro isn't a bad comedian he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he shouldn't waste his time doing comedy.  DeNiro endows Billy Sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul.  It is a pleasure watching him work.  It seems every film I watch lately has Charlize Theron in it.  I saw The Legend of Bagger Vance' Men of Honor' and The Yards' right in a row and I was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 actually she only did five.  This was a minor role for Theron but she carried it off well and managed to stay with DeNiro step for step.  David Keith who costarred with Richard Gere in Officer and a Gentleman' has a cameo hereThe DVD has some interesting special features including reflections by the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes.I enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the onedimensional presentation.  I rated it a 710.  I'm a sucker for underdog stories and I have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme.  This film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that compensate for some of the director's shortcomings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Men of Honor stars Cuba Gooding Jr. as real life Navy Diver Carl Brashear who defied a man's Navy to become the first African American Navy Diver. Sometimes by his side and sometimes his adversary there was one man who Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday Robert DeNiro. Sunday in a lot of ways pushed aggravated and helped Carl become the man he wanted to be. I loved Cuba in this film. His portrayal here is as liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington was in The Hurricane. Through every scene we can see his passion motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream. We can see the struggle within in him as he embarks to make his father proud. I also loved how the director created and brought forth a lot of tension in some of the key diving scenes. Brashear's encounter with a submarine during a salvage mission is heartstopping and brilliant. The only fault I could see would have to lie in the supporting cast. Cuba and DeNiro's characters are very intricate and exciting to watch. Which does make you a little sad when they have to butt heads with such twodimensional supporting characters. The evil Lt. Cmdr. Hanks Sunday's wife Charlize Theron the eccentric diving school colonel Hal Holbrook and Cuba's love interest are the characters I found to not have very much depth. What could have made these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop them. Why was that colonel always in his tower? How come Sunday's wife was so bitter and always drunk?Another curious question has to be this. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean if this film is chronicling this man's life wouldn't his wedding be an important event? Maybe it's just me. Men of Honor however is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit envelops. This film will inspire and make you feel for this man's struggle. Which I do believe was the reason this powerful story was told. My hat goes off to you Carl Brashear. I really admire your strength.".

We are shown the series of struggles from boyhood on that Brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true and then to keep it alive. Not the least of the challenges was Master Diver Bill Sunday Robert DeNiro the head trainer at the diving school the Navy sends Brashear to who is not especially sympathetic to Brashear's goals but who ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and supporter.This is a good movie fast paced and with a lot of action although not an action pic in the normal sense of the word. There's a very human story here as well and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it there's also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960's between older and younger naval officers the old navy vs the new navy. The performances are quite good  particularly Goodings'. I thought DeNiro was perhaps a bit over the top in his portrayal of Sunday although who knows Sunday might well have been this extreme kind of loose cannon and the portrayal of Sunday's wife Gwen by Charlize Theron also made me question whether these parts were jazzed up to provide entertainment value.A good movie though.

Gooding gives a rock solid performance as an ambitious Navy diver whose iron will leads him to fight discrimination and try to become the first ever colored master diver. Along the way he matches wits withand eventually gains the respect ofhis belligerent hardnosed superior De Niro. Considering the film's definite Rocky formula you'll probably be a step ahead of the story at every turn but it's welldirected acted with such great conviction and has a finale so powerful and moving that you almost have to go along for the ride.

Navy's deepsea diver training program that is run by a racist zealot Robert DeNiro. If the program weren't bad enough it's got to be located in Bayonne New Jersey.There's nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his Southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively. Cuba Gooding raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the South is the expectable paragon of rectitude. The girls  one could hardly call them women  are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense. Other decent performers  Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook  have even more perfunctory roles.That's about it. Almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer. A ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro salutes indoors uncovered. After a brutal assault on hospital personnel he's transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted. Somebody shouts I'm outta here in the early 1950s. Maybe it was a common expression at the time. If so my bad. People address each other by rank  Lieutenant Boatswain's Mate Commander as they do in the Army whereas in the Navy they are simple Mister if an officer or addressed by their last name if enlisted. I didn't bother to check if there was a rank called Senior Master Chief in 1950.Cuba Gooding has a tough row to hoe. Everyone in the Navy it seems hates Negroes except for one guy from Wisconsin. He stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class. It's like the scene in Animal House in which the applicant to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh a black man and a blind kid.Gooding is an enlisted man a second class petty officer. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school. In one of their arguments she pleads with him. She just wants to be a doctor and he should join her quit the Navy and lead a quiet life. And just let life pass you by? he retorts. Yes. Yes just be a doctor's spouse and let life pass you by. You can wave to it from the golf course in Boca Raton.These kinds of flicks were common enough in World War II. Bombardier Airial Gunner that sort of thing. Cheap as they often were they had some educational features. You learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner. Here the technical details are skipped over perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them except Boyle's law which we learned in highschool chemistry.I couldn't follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this wouldn't exist. If I got the mechanical problems right it was because I guessed correctly. The direction is no help either. The movie abounds in close ups so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had. And the emergencies are confusing because they're ill focused.Why go on? Want to see a better example of this kind of movie? Almost any will do  except maybe G. I. Jane in which the abused hero is a heroin. Try the training camp scenes in The Young Lions. There the victim is a Jew. Or try From Here to Eternity in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict on just like Cool Hand Luke. No easy excuses are offered because easy excuses are too easy.Thoroughly formulaic and not well done.".

If you can do that it reallyis good.The story of Carl Brashear a truetolife hero is inspirational enough to last a lifetime. Look him up on the internet... The entire story is more amazing than the film as the Director admitted in his comments. There were only three AfricanAmerican U.S. Navy divers in World War II. However none reached the status of U.S. Navy Master Diver. Carl Brashear was THE first AfricanAmerican U.S. Navy Master Diver. AND he was the first amputee diver to ever be certified or recertified as a U.S. Navy diver. Resounding Applause.On the negative side of the movie's ledger Should I tell you of only one of the many loopholes? Yeah I'll mark this comment as containing spoilers and do so... The early pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea They'd never have had the time to suit up a full Mark V diver even if he were the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday in time to be only ... a couple of minutes late saving the pilot.So for loopholes goofs and overdramatization I derated Men of Honor from a perfect 10 down to a 7.Will Hollywood EVER realize that the unalloyed truth is so much better that their overdramatic approach to storytelling? I doubt it. Too bad!".

	schema:reviewBody "This review has spoilers but just avoid the whole movie altogether!Ouch! This was left me angry.  Not at the way Cub Gooding Jr.'s character was treated but at the fact that I could have spend those precious few hours on a much better film... or at least folded some clean towels.  At least the towels would have left me more content with my time.I sorry... so sorry.  But this film is just a refried G.I. Jane with the same cardboard characters and same cornball plot  Person tries to get into elite group of the Armed Forces person is of a different sexrace than the norm person gets pushed around by commanding officer person overcomes the odds and in the end... the lead character and the former cruel officer are best friends!  WHAT?  Wouldn't you be a little sore at the guy who refused to let you do the same crappy job they do just because you're different?Yes in this overzealous movie we see Cuba Gooding Jr. a likable actor yet seems to shake his face too much and the scenerychewing Hollywood bigman Robert DeNiro squaring off in a race to become the Navy's first black diver.  It seems to be a posterfilm from our government to be a strong brave man and join the Navy.  But if this film was to be believed the Navy is run by a bunch of old racist and mean whiteguys.  Hal Holbrook's character is somehow placed in command of an entire navaltraining camp eventhough he is extremely cruel to his men and is a tad insane.  Although the film may lead you to believe that Holbrook is the reason for it allDeNiro delivers all the mean remarks and teasings.  You may be reminded of his role in Cape Fear.  Yet at the end we find DeNero and Gooding to be the closest of friends.Oh and speaking of the end it seems to have a hard time getting there.  Just when Gooding lands the job he's been trying so hard to get he loses part of his leg and the movie is forced to drag on for about another good forty minutes.  This left me wondering if the producers suddenly demanded more film stock for tax purposes.  The injury does allow gooding's character to overcome a few new odds... which include tearing off the remainder of his leg and scaring off his wife and small child just to prove that he's a better man than... uh that one guy.Yes and speaking also of his wife that is the one part of the movie that is sped along.  The first time we see her they meet.  The second time he proposes.  The third she's pregnant.  The fourth they have a large boy! They should probably fell through her original plan of leaving him seeing how he may be somewhat of a masochist.The sad thing is the fact that historically AfricanAmericans were denied the chance to serve in groups of the military for decades and this is taken from true events.  But the truth must have been smashed and molded into a trite and cornball script.  If you must see this movi I may suggest you check out the HBO film The Tuskegee Airmen.  Although not as highlybudgeted as Men of Honor it's focuses more on true blackoppression in the military and not trying to just move us.  Plus this also stars Cuba Gooding Jr. whose more at home here.  At least in the HBO film we don't have to see the racist whiteguy suddenly taking the main character to grab a beer together at the end.".

It shows what still is true prejudice and racism are well alive worldwide.I have no complaints about the story but I do think that the script lacks quality. It has way too much pathos for my taste and does the conflict it tries do depict no justice. It doesn't want to tell us about the oppression of ethnic groups we should be well aware of that anyhow it is happening all the time. It tries to depict the fate of an individual and as such it utterly fails.DeNiro and Cuba do not work too well together either. There's no chemistry. It always feels like Scene 08 Take 15. I do like DeNiro and Cuba usually and regard them as being fine actors but maybe they should read the script a little closer next time before hopping aboard...Just because the story is true and just because the issue depicted is still a problem today  not only in the states but worldwide  still does not merit any higher rating than a 5 and that mostly due to the craftsmanship of the 2 main actors.".

I was honored to be a witness to one of the greatest films ever made.Men of Honor is one of the most courageous emotional and touching films I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. Along with The Perfect Storm and Pay It Forward Men of Honor is an example of a film which made me feel good on the inside as well as the outside. Furthermore this film is true testament to the courage and bravery men and women like Carl Brashear show in the line of duty.Men of Honor is one of the finest films I've seen in the past year because it has two of the best actors and the best ensemble cast since The Perfect Storm. Men of Honor CANNOT be missed under any circumstances because it is a testament to the human spirit and one man's unrelenting quest to accomplish his dream.Men of Honor profiles the life of the first black navy diver and his inspirational courageous and unrelenting quest in becoming the best navy diver in the United States by achieving the status of master diver. Carl Brashear is the true definition of an American hero because he embodies unwillingness to give up in the face of hard times.It was a true pleasure and inspiration to watch Men of Honor because it afforded me the opportunity to learn a valuable history lesson the knowledge I gained from this film will stay with me for life.Men of Honor is a film that boasts one of the greatest compilation of talent in Hollywood. Hollywood's intimidator Robert DeNiro leads this allstar cast that includes Cuba Gooding Jr. Charlize Theron Anjunue Ellis David Keith Michael Rappaport and Hal Holbrook. It didn't take long to draw my first conclusion from Men of Honor the ensemble cast brought home the true spirit and essence of one man's fight to be respected and treated as an equal. For this reason Men of Honor has the BEST ensembles of the year.Only one outcome can come when DeNiro stars in a film only one outcome supersedes all others when DeNiro film hits theaters. Excitement and success are the outcomes that make my heart skip a beat with anticipation. When I hear the Robert DeNiro's name being mentioned as part of a cast I will be the first person in line to buy tickets because I know exactly what the outcome will be. His film credentials include some of the best films ever made. DeNiro brings so much to each role including intensity intelligence honesty and character. Without a shadow of doubt DeNiro's greatest quality that he brings to Men of Honor is character. His performance as Billy Sunday is his best in his career because he puts his whole heart and soul into this film.From What Dreams May Come to As Good As It Gets Gooding's repertoire grows and his star is sure to stay on the rise. With his stage presence talent class honesty and sophistication Gooding rises to the top of his class and becomes one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood.Gooding's role as Carl Brashear is one of the most inspiring and uplifting performances I have ever come across on film. His screen presence honesty and class add credibility to this film and to the portrayal of Carl Brashear. Utilizing incredible sensitivity Gooding captures the spirit of his character with little effort and great success. It is with roles like Carl Brashear that will win him many academy awards and a bright future in film.Men of Honor is a beautifully crafted wellacted masterpiece that will leave everyone with smiles on their faces. DeNiro and Gooding come together as one to make a movie which is a true testament to the human spirit and courage.The writers deserve most of the credit for a screenplay with rich quality and adding depth to the characters. It is great to watch a film that allows the viewer to see each character in the film developed to the fullest as Men of Honor did.This film is most likely the greatest 'based on a true story' film that has been made in America. It ranks right up on top with The Hurricane Titanic Saving Private Ryan and U571. This is a masterpiece that should not be overlooked.I hope everyone gets the chance to see Men of Honor as it truly is a remarkable film. I hope everyone watches Men of Honor because it is one of the most inspirational films I've seen.".

It's interesting to note that the same film on the same website got a 74 rating from viewers.Not that the opinion of critics is all THAT important to me.

But these chumps have a way of coming across like their opinion somehow matters more than yours and even worse they love to hate.I'll grant you that this movie is old fashioned well except for the fbombs syrupy and a little predictable... after all you know right from the beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr. portraying reallife Navy hero Carl Brashear is going to triumph eventually at every turn simply by the way he comes across determined and plucky strongwilled and optimistic.But his performance and that of De Niro as Billy Sunday a composite character of several reallife people are so strong so inspiring that you'll be on your feet cheering many of the film's scenes especially the courtroom climax. You'd have to be a real stick in the mud not to be moved by these scenes. Like our nation's film critics. Michael Rappaport is excellent as well as a sweetnatured stuttering diving student that befriends Gooding's Brashear. If anyone has seen Higher Learning this character totally redeems that character.Anyway this confirms what I've always felt don't listen to critics. See this movie and get inspired.".

	schema:reviewBody "First let me note that there seems to be different versions of the film floating around on home video. A few reviews complain about poorly lit or dark scenes. Someone mentioned that there's a bad pan  scan version floating around. And apparently in the early history of the film there was a badly cut version making the rounds with the title Cars That Eat People. That may have even ended up on VHS. So make sure you get the Home Vision Entertainment DVD released in 2003. It also has director Peter Weir's film The Plumber 1979 as a bonus plus interviews with Weir about each film as well as trailers. More importantly it has a pristine original widescreen cut of The Cars That Ate Paris. As long as you have your television or monitor set up correctly the film has remarkably crisp frequently beautiful cinematography that looks like it could have been shot yesterday.There also seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about the nature of the film. Basically The Cars That Ate Paris is a quirky arthouse drama. Yes it has elements of macabre humor horror and many other genres but those are not a focus. The Cars That Ate Paris is as much a western as it is a horror film which is not to say that it doesn't have elements of the western genreit does. But the tone is much more similar to say Bagdad Caf aka Out of Rosenheim 1987 or Delicatessen 1991 hmmmnotice the culinary metaphor motif. If you want to think of The Cars That Ate Paris as a horror filmand it is basically a surrealist nightmarethink of it as something like Maximum Overdrive 1986Trucks 1997 meets Horror Hotel aka City of the Dead 1960 but made by David Lynch as a realist soap opera.So what is the film about more literally? Well it's best perhaps if you know as little about it before as possible but on the other hand it's a bit cryptic and Peter Weir isn't exactly forthcoming with explanatory expositionthe film remains very open to interpretation to the endso maybe a vague description won't hurt. The Paris of the title is not in France. It's instead a small bucolic village in rural Australia. The town has quite a few dirty secrets. The two primary secrets have to do with an automobile part obsession and a program of human experimentation. For the most part they try to keep people out of the town which has a very small population but their twisted fetishes necessitate the occasional admission of outsiders though in an unusual involuntary manner. The film is centered on the story of one particular outsider Arthur Waldo Terry Camilleri who manages to enter Paris relatively unscathed and who for unspecified reasons is worked into the fabric of the town. Arthur's arrival and integration roughly corresponds to a growing cleavage between generations or at least between the status quo and a rebellious group of younger men and he unwittingly serves as a catalyst to what amounts to a civil war.Although in Peter Weir's video interview included on the DVD he refers to Arthur as an unsympathetic protagonist I beg to differ. Camilleri plays Arthur as an enigmatically captivating simpletonthe most entrancing blank personality this side of Peter Sellers' Chauncey Gardiner in Being There 1979. For most of the film Weir shuttles Arthur around like a pawn enabling a metaphorical window through which to satirically examine small town Australian life. In this respect The Cars That Ate Paris somewhat resembles the basic gist of Lars von Trier's Dogville 2003 except that unlike Dogville The Cars That Ate Paris is a good film.It's particularly funny how Arthur is shuttled into a variety of jobs which he is assumed qualified for by a mere change of clothing and very minor changes at that and title. He's a doctor one moment a parking enforcer the next. Weir works in satirical jabs towards everything from appealing to noble grand narratives about pioneer forefathers to the discrepancy between religious private and political life the myth of the welladjusted nuclear family the charade of public ceremonies and even partakes in a slight Lord of the Fliesstyled commentary on progress.But not everything is social critique. Weir is just as concerned with and just as good at imbibing in quirkiness for its own sake although even that stuff we could read as a critique on social conventions if we wanted to and seesawing between a kind of community existentialist nightmare and an Our Townlike small village drama. And just in case that's too balanced every so often he puts us in the middle of a spaghetti western with the beginnings of midstreet showdowns. Much of the rebellious youth material can be interpreted as a western with hodgepodge automobiles which is probably why those youths are the ones to don clothing that looks as if Weir borrowed it from the set of A Fistful of Dollars aka Per un pugno di dollari 1964.The music is similarly disparate ranging from technopsychedelia that's something like Pink Floyd's Time to pensive contemporarysounding themes or the hilariously amateurish performance at the Paris Ball.This is definitely not a film for all tastes. If you wouldn't typically like arthouse films you probably won't appreciate The Cars That Ate Paris either and even if you do typically like arthouse films you probably won't appreciate The Cars That Ate Paris unless you have a strong taste for the bizarre and macabre.".

This is a strange movie set in a weird town in a barren outback landscape where the normal rules of western society are being quietly ignored by the citizens for their own ends.  There are peculiar parallels with 'Mad Max' and I wonder if Australians are somehow daunted by the vastness of their own country what it might conceal and their reliance on the automobile.  'The Cars That Ate Paris' is a gothic horror which takes a glancing swipe at consumerism and how it disassociates small communities. This is flagged right at the beginning with the opening parody of a cigarette commercial also killers! ending in the first wreck.  There are lashings of black humour like this and a few things to say about religion and the cult of the car.  A fine lowbudget film.".

By the end of it however the movie seems to emerge as some sort of societal parable an allegory to the repression of a closeknit society that values appearances and tradition more than anything else and which must bury secrets in its own backyard to do so but there's so much distraction and incoherence the point is never made with any clarity or force.At one point the score turns Morricone circa Once Upon a Time in the West and we get a showdown in the street and young men dressed with cowboy hats. We get Carmageddonstyle cars circling the statue of a cannon like Comanches painted for war. We get the vague promise of a subplot about car crash survivors turned vegetables who are kept in the hospital of the small town and who later turn up in a ball masque dressed in hoods and carton boxes a nod to Shock Corridor? but it never goes anywhere. Peter Weir went on to make such remarkable films as Picnic at Hanging Rock and The Last Wave and while this never reaches the hypnotic levels of those films it's intriguing in its own quirky awkward way. It's like a movie struggling with itself a cult classic trying to break free from the confines of a forgettable eccentricity.".

No matter how popular and acclaimed films like Dead Poets Society Master  Commander and The Truman Show are they're blunt compared to the uniqueness and virility of The Cars that Ate Paris. At least this film doesn't feature tiresome morality speeches and here the dialogues are in fact surprisingly controversial most of the time. For example when explaining to total strangers that you accidentally killed a old man by accidentally running your car over him do you expect them to reply with Yeah those old pedestrians are a real problem aren't they? Welcome to Paris a remote little outback Australian town where the people go to church love their families and where the economy entirely thrives on one thing car crashes! The whole town assists in deliberately causing accidents and then use the parts and accessories as currency to buy stuff in the shops. The outsiders from the accidents either end up in the graveyard as medical guinea pigs in the local hospital or  as in protagonist Arthur Waldo's case  as brand new residents of Paris and close friends to the mayor. It's truly close to brilliant how Peter Weir manages to sustain the friendly and nonthreatening tone throughout the whole movie. All members of the community are basically insane psychopaths yet you symphatize with them a lot more because the hero Arthur is such an antipathetic loser and the young generation that eventually revolts against the town's ancient habits are boisterous and uncanny freaks. Even the mayor who's really the evil mastermind is portrayed like a jolly figure with whom you'd love to chat. I know that most people wish to forget their viewing of The Cars that Ate Paris because it moves slow and looks dark but the basic premise really is one of the best horror ideas ever coming from Australian cinema. And that WV Beetle covered in spikes is a highly memorable piece of scenery!".

	schema:reviewBody "Before Peter Weir went on to make 'A' class films such as The Dead Poets Society and Witness he had a rather unsuccessful stint as a Bmovie cult flick director. Despite the fact that he's become better known for his critically acclaimed films his lesser cult films show much more imagination and are far more fun to watch. The Cars That Ate Paris works from a delicious premise. A small township in Australia named 'Paris' causes car accidents and salvages valuables from the wreckages. The town's currency is radios clothes etc and this lucrative business is doing well for the town. When someone survives a crash they usually end up mentally disabled which is good for the town as it stops them from being caught by the pesky insurance investigator. This is all well and good until George and brother Arthur drive into town. George is killed in the crash but Arthur survives it pretty much unharmed. Nobody has ever left Paris before which prompts the Mayor to take the young man into his family home. This is something that will go on to have massive repercussions on the township of Paris...Peter Weir deliciously blends several elements into the plot line. On one hand we have the incredibly surreal idea of a whole town killing people for their valuables. This blends with the whole crazy cult idea and this in turn mixes with the idea of the things that people will do to survive. Weir has speckled the movie with loads of great imagery such as the old women who's job it is to take the valuables from the cars stuffing clothes down their top and the devilish cornerstone of society the Mayor overseeing all the horror. Despite all the film's good elements however Weir has failed to make the film a complete whole. It may be down to inexperience but while he's busy creating his atmosphere the characters have been forgotten about and this makes it difficult to care for them and the story beyond an aesthetic level. There is much to like about this movie and it's definitely worth seeing for the imagery alone but it's hard to really love it and that stops me from giving the film a high rating. I still recommend the movie however as it's well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The residents of a small outback town cause car crashes on it's country hilly roads and strip all valuable parts from the vehicles to make new cars. When Arthur Waldo survives a crash that kills his brother he stays in town as he is too scared to drive.  He begins to notice strange things happening around the town with the doctor and the mayor drawing suspicion.This is a cult movie.  When someone tells you something is a cult movie it usually means one of two things 1 it's a small indie movie that people have come to discover and it's has grown gradually in success such as Reservoir Dogs that outgrew it's cult status.  Or 2 it's a movie of any size that the vast majority of people hate and a small group of fans adore. Unfortunately this is the latter.  Some people will sing this things praises till the end of time but I'm afraid I don't get it.  The plot seems to be going somewhere  you start off knowing very little about who's involved in the crashes and why they do it etc along the way we get clues about experiments on humans and outsiders who live like Mad Max style scavengers but it leaves us with no answers.  The relationship between the mayor and Arthur is strange and isn't followed and I still don't see why the crashes were staged  other than to let some of the residents build a scrap yard.The performances are sufficiently creepy to help build an air of expectation. Terry Camilleri is epically good and the wishywashy Arthur. However they are all betrayed by a story that has nowhere to build to and nothing to say.  The director also builds the tension well but with nowhere to go what could he do it's good he's had much better material since.Overall the film was a severe disappointment  and I wasn't expecting much from it!  It's full of promise but the story dies threequarters of the way in.  The spiky beetle is very menacing and looks great but it's not enough to build a film around one cool image.  OK  but don't expect any answers.".

The naive gullible yank soon discovers that things are not exactly quite right and okay in the deceptively sleepy burg. For starters that car crash wasn't an accident it was deliberately staged by the resourceful and enterprising townspeople who eke out a living by salvaging car parts from wrecked vehicles. Then there's a resident mad scientist who's fond of experimenting on car crash survivors turning the hapless folks into mute lobotomized imbeciles called veggies. And the local dragracing teenage hooligans are getting increasingly out of control carousing about in their lethal garishly madeup cars one sports spikes all along its body like a porcupine! until the wee hours of the morning and making a real nuisance of themselves. The town's friendly but ineffectual mayor winningly played by John Mellion offers Camilleri the plum job of parking superintendent in a desperate attempt to restore law and order.The quirky imaginative script by Weir Keith Gow and Piers David ingeniously uses the oddball premise as an ideal springboard for barbed social commentary on the perils of cross country traveling the very modern dangers the automobile poses to quiet everyday life how isolated communities cut off from the rest of civilization can easily degenerate into barbarism and lawlessness the extreme measures impoverished people will resort to in order to get by in life and even a wacky generation gap conflict pitting uptight disciplined morally rigid adults against rowdy uninhibited nihilist youth. Weirs' direction is precariously pitched between the grimly horrific and the darkly facetious boldly maintaining an uneasy tone which keeps the viewer constantly off guard and gives the irregular proceedings a potently unsettling weirdedout edge. John McLean's grainy luridly grungy cinematography allows the Australian outback to take on a scary nightmarishly surreal aura while Bruce Smeaton's sometimes dissonant more often strangely jaunty rocktinged score adds substantially to the pervasively unnerving nuttiness.

	schema:headline " A Satire on Scavengers Small Town Despots and Sheep People";
	schema:reviewBody "The Cars That Ate Paris is delightfully shocking in a way that still resonates today. I say delightfully because there is every indication in the subtext of the film that what we're watching is a biting hilarious satire. It works as a satire because of the naturalness of the actors. It doesn't work so well to caricaturize personalities in film as much as it does in literature because caricaturization loses its shock and becomes simply a cause for unbelieving laughter. Instead satire works better in film when the personalities of the characters are as honest as can be against the backdrop of outrageous circumstances. I'm sure I could think of exceptions like Dr. Strangelove for example which needs the caricaturization I think because its plot deals with the mechanisms of government and war. When the scale is that large caricaturization works. But The Cars That Ate Paris doesn't have such lofty targets. It deals with the ordinary people in the world who are easily swept into the agendas of others sometimes by their own mindlessness. Speaking again for the naturalness of the actors the ordinary people in this film all seem like real citizens of a dusty scavenger town with delusions of order and efficiency. I was particularly stunned by John Meillon who plays the mayor of the dusty scavenger town called Paris Australia. His performance is so seamless so richly mixed between an authoritative assurance and a desperation to hide from the truth that he is frightening frightening in what seems to be his complete lack of introspection or morality. And there doesn't seem to be the need for either in Paris. His character while in control of most of the goingson in the town doesn't seem to need to order anyone around. It's as if they accepted him and his authority as a matter of practicality as if it were unfathomable to do otherwise. He therefore carries an almost metaphysical command over the actions and even appearances of the other characters in the film. It's a hefty role to take on and make real but John Meillon succeeds marvelously. It's one of the great bad guy performances that isn't really a bad guy performance. As an audience member you just feel the entropy and instability vibrating behind the eyes of Meillon. Aside from the natural acting the film succeeds because of Peter Weir's vision which finds its greatest catalyst in the wild west sepia toned cinematography by John McLean. The camera is focus more on the faces of the actors than anything and anytime it steps out into the dirt roads of Paris it exposes hardly anything other than the commotion and impenetrability of the town. It's a skillful early work from Weir who would later succeed again in satirizing authority and control over the events of life with The Truman Show in 1997. The only thing that wasn't all that awesome was the performance by Terry Camilleri as Arthur the man who comes to live in Paris by accident. It seems like he was uncomfortable as an actor almost unable to get into his character's shoes. However it doesn't ruin the film when Meillon's performance is so intoxicating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arthur survives a car crash but his brother was not so lucky. When he finally comes around he finds out he's in small country town called Parris and the local mayor tries to get Arthur to become a citizen. Strangely there some offbeat things going on in Paris and when the traumatised Arthur tries to leave he realises that he's trapped in this hell of a town. But what becomes a shock to Arthur is when he discovers the main source of income is that of salvaging parts of passing motorist's car after causing them to have a car accident.Peter Weir's first feature is a kooky lowbudgeted flick that I saw quite awhile back but I did not remember too much about it other than the devilishly looking sliver Volkswagen covered with spikes. I actually managed to record it off TV only couple nights ago and I just finally got around to seeing it again. This cult film I still find to be one tasty dark comedy that has a biting satirical edge about it. It ain't a perfect production and the film is highly incoherent but damn the novelty behind it is far from generic which made it such an engrossing and energetic exercise. Weir went onto make some prime films in the 70s with Picnic at Hanging Rock being his most vintage of his work in the period. The Cars that Ate Paris was a learning step in that right direction and a chance to find his feet. While the enigmatic story leaves many things up in the air with it's odd assortment of characters and ironic turns but it's Weir's creative style and sly humour that shines through. Some of the satirical comments worked into the picture is that of Australia's obsession with automobiles to that of rebellion with the younger generation disrespecting their elders' terms. Weir is able to poke fun at these points with such nice balance of black humour and the smirking tone of it all really does stick to you without losing its way. There's some unbelievably humorous quotes in the dialogue too. But I actually found some disturbing scenes in the way how this car fetish lifestyle a guilty sin waiting to break out has become part of everyday life for the town that the harshness devoted on unexpected motorists is simply part of the parcel. It's a dog eat dog world in Paris. The actual feel of the film towards it deterioration of the town and menacingly designed cars you could say goes on to find its way into the Mad Max films. Even a little homage of a spaghetti western standoff creeps in. There's not much in a way of suspense and it lumbers about in patches but when the mayhem escalates it's plain devastating in its terrorising short bursts. The violence on the other hand isn't shy either with being well conceived and there's one memorable aftermath. The rural location and inhabitants of the town are simply alienating in their welcoming vibe and also with an eerie score that gives out a groovy twang that works up the mood rather effectively. There's just something essentially whimsical about Bruce Smeaton's variety of tunes. The relax performances are adequate even though the characters are pretty much vacant shells since most of the effort went into the look and thick atmosphere. John Meillon is great as the selfrighteous Mayor and Terry Camilleri was solid as the timid Arthur who I actually sympathised for. The manipulative relationship between the Mayor who basically adopts Arthur as a son is an interesting setup. Another recognizable performance that stood out was Bruce Spence as the very loopy Charlie.

	onyx:emotionText "Arthur survives a car crash but his brother was not so lucky. When he finally comes around he finds out he's in small country town called Parris and the local mayor tries to get Arthur to become a citizen. Strangely there some offbeat things going on in Paris and when the traumatised Arthur tries to leave he realises that he's trapped in this hell of a town. But what becomes a shock to Arthur is when he discovers the main source of income is that of salvaging parts of passing motorist's car after causing them to have a car accident.Peter Weir's first feature is a kooky lowbudgeted flick that I saw quite awhile back but I did not remember too much about it other than the devilishly looking sliver Volkswagen covered with spikes. I actually managed to record it off TV only couple nights ago and I just finally got around to seeing it again. This cult film I still find to be one tasty dark comedy that has a biting satirical edge about it. It ain't a perfect production and the film is highly incoherent but damn the novelty behind it is far from generic which made it such an engrossing and energetic exercise. Weir went onto make some prime films in the 70s with Picnic at Hanging Rock being his most vintage of his work in the period. The Cars that Ate Paris was a learning step in that right direction and a chance to find his feet. While the enigmatic story leaves many things up in the air with it's odd assortment of characters and ironic turns but it's Weir's creative style and sly humour that shines through. Some of the satirical comments worked into the picture is that of Australia's obsession with automobiles to that of rebellion with the younger generation disrespecting their elders' terms. Weir is able to poke fun at these points with such nice balance of black humour and the smirking tone of it all really does stick to you without losing its way. There's some unbelievably humorous quotes in the dialogue too. But I actually found some disturbing scenes in the way how this car fetish lifestyle a guilty sin waiting to break out has become part of everyday life for the town that the harshness devoted on unexpected motorists is simply part of the parcel. It's a dog eat dog world in Paris. The actual feel of the film towards it deterioration of the town and menacingly designed cars you could say goes on to find its way into the Mad Max films. Even a little homage of a spaghetti western standoff creeps in. There's not much in a way of suspense and it lumbers about in patches but when the mayhem escalates it's plain devastating in its terrorising short bursts. The violence on the other hand isn't shy either with being well conceived and there's one memorable aftermath. The rural location and inhabitants of the town are simply alienating in their welcoming vibe and also with an eerie score that gives out a groovy twang that works up the mood rather effectively. There's just something essentially whimsical about Bruce Smeaton's variety of tunes. The relax performances are adequate even though the characters are pretty much vacant shells since most of the effort went into the look and thick atmosphere. John Meillon is great as the selfrighteous Mayor and Terry Camilleri was solid as the timid Arthur who I actually sympathised for. The manipulative relationship between the Mayor who basically adopts Arthur as a son is an interesting setup. Another recognizable performance that stood out was Bruce Spence as the very loopy Charlie. Simply a fun movie that's hardly dull because it rambles along with many awkward situations and black humour.It's not for everyone but people who are interested in Weir's work or that of odd premises should give it a go.";

The poor lighting and budget really show here and make this movie painful to watch. This movie is so devoid of any action and is so frustratingly paced that I barely made it through without fast forwarding.  In fact I showed this movie to a friend with major parts fast forwarded and he didn't miss any of the plot.  Watching this movie in fast forward my 2nd viewing shows just how many scenes were totally worthless and just add to the boredom.  I have seen other Weir movies before and understand that his pacing is really slow and doesn't follow conventional plots but this movie was very unappealing. Picnic At Hanging Rock is a vastly superior Weir film if you are at all interested in the director.  That movie creates an interesting mode and the mysterious circumstances are inticing here there is no inticement.  This movie is recommended only to those who are either Austrailian and have an interest in some black humor which is greatly lost on anyone who isn't austrialian or those who like to watch MST3k quality movies minus the commentary.Zoopansick".

A psychiatrist a marvelous as usual Patricia Clarkson tells the family that the best thing they can do for Lars is to encourage his delusion until he works through whatever is causing it they relay that to the townspeople who take it to heart.

In addition to Gosling and Clarkson Emily Mortimer shines as Lars's caring and worried sisterinlaw.It really irritates me that critics were divided on this movie on the basis of it pushing the boundaries of credibility when they almost unanimously praised Gone Baby Gone a film so melodramatic and heavy handed as to be no less implausible and that goes down as two of the most unpleasant hours I've spent in a movie theatre for a long time.

But Gosling provides the heart and soul of this remarkable film that never strikes a false note.The movie has an incredibly powerful and positive message about the ability of a community to heal and nurture a troubled soul by treating it with acceptance and compassion. It should be required viewing by anyone who feels alone in the world.";

Many other people in the cinema expected the same and from the beginning of the film they laughed at the slightest hint that something might be funny. Little by little though the laughs went to silence and people understood they were watching a drama not a comedy. Indeed there were scenes that made you laugh but the more important scenes were those that take you by the heart and make you feel and understand. Thanks to the great acting by Ryan Gosling Emily Mortimer Paul Schneider Patricia Clarkson all the supporting cast you get a feel of a community of neighbors friends family perhaps too idealized but nevertheless giving hope and warmth.What totally surprised me was that this is an original American movie correct me if i'm wrong. The names of the characters people's features and clothes the weather and location if you like all made me think this is an authentic Scandinavian movie up to the dialog and plot itself. I could literally see rural Scandinavian types and imagined the characters speak Norwegian or Swedish. The whole flow of the movie the way it never went out of order kept its steady peaceful step so typical for European movies  all my regards to director Craig Gillespie for achieving this. Anything else would've spoiled this sad movie diminished its message denied the sacrifices and human pain of its charactersThe story in short is of a man troubled by his past and afraid of closeness even with his loving family. He finds an seemingly undemanding friend in a humansized doll he buys over the internet.

	schema:headline " Love is a Weird Thing Especially When it's Real";
	schema:reviewBody "Lars and the Real Girl may come off as an unrealistic overthetop completely unfathomable fairytale for the mentally ill while the line between realism and fantasy is tightly walked. Some of the actions of the characters are questionable mostly with the way the townspeople treat Lars and his delusions. Lars is incredibly shy. He sits alone in the dark. He'll make up any excuse he can muster to avoid even a simple breakfast at his brother's house He lives in the garage separated from the house of course and completely isolated  detached from human contact. Lars struggles to connect with people which is due to years of neglect from his father and the death of his mother during child birth. His brother left the first chance he got so Lars has never felt love nor has he been given the chance to share his love for others.One day Lars' coworker is surfing internet porn and comes across a real sex doll. He shows this to Lars who doesn't give it too much attention but we see the wheels turning. Later we see a box dropped off at his garage and then it all starts. This will be Lars' way of giving all this love that he has to give to someone that won't do anything but accept it. Someone who isn't concerned with the superficial and someone who he can connect with. She's someone who won't crowd him or make him feel uncomfortable. She will support him. The film slowly and gradually morphs into a story of love and acceptance. There's more to the story than just a simple sex doll toted around town by a lonely guy looking for attention. The film has a heart and that heartbeat is pulsated through the screen by the incredible performance from one of the most talented young actors in the business Ryan Gosling. I honestly don't know if another actor could have pulled this off. He hardly ever has eye contact with any single person in the film. He's given a flower and told to give it to someone nice but when Margo comes strolling along he flings the flower into the bushes. Then he runs away. Margo likes him and he likes her but neither are any good at expressing their feelings. Lars is searching for that special someone and like a lot of us we can relate when we meet the one that has it all. You just can't seem to find the words or you can find them and just can't say them.The film raises the question about treatment of the mentally ill. Do we really need medication that wipes out their feelings and emotions or do we just need the basics? Love care support and acceptance for who you are. They accept Bianca because of Lars and Lars finds love and acceptance. He learns human interaction.This is a rare film where we see a group of people do good  even though their method may be questioned  in order to help someone struggling with an illness. This isn't a film that's laugh out loud funny a few occasional ones here and there but I found myself smiling throughout. The final act had me choked up. It created a much stronger reaction than I had anticipated. Gosling had me laughing and nearly brought to tears all at the same time. Paul Schneider was also exceptional. The film does a great job of questioning normality and the treatment of the mentally ill. This is more like a fable and some might question the reality of it and knock it for being unrealistic but if they do then they're missing the entire point. Lars and the Real Girl is a near modern masterpiece that has a message. The ending is predictable but without the ending the film isn't complete and the message is vastly different.".

	schema:reviewBody "If anyone had told me I would one day be crying during a movie about a man and his blowup doll I would have called them a liar. But here I am going through at least 3 Kleenex even after the movie is over. Lars and the Real Girl is a touching quirky film that is a lesson in why people do the things they do. Anyone that is interested in social work counseling psychology or ministry should watch this movie.Lars is a quiet young man probably 30s who does not like to be touched. He works in a cubicle in some random office. Currently he lives in the garage of his childhood home. His brother Gus and new wife Karin live in the connected house and are expecting a child soon. Karin puts a great deal of effort into trying to pull Lars out of his shell. Gus on the other hand thinks Lars is happy how he is. It's his choice to spend time alone isn't it? The status quo is shaken up however when Lars brings home a new girlfriend. Her name is Bianca and she is a blowup doll. But Lars doesn't realize this or if he does he doesn't acknowledge it. She is to him real. He talks to her as if she is. For everyone who thinks sounds disgusting take note his relationship with Bianca is not sexual by any means. On the contrary Bianca used to be a missionary and the two of them insist that Bianca sleep in the house instead of in bed with Lars in the garage. I say the two of them insist because Lars actually seems to hear answers when he asks Bianca's questions.At first everyone is shaken up. The four of them go to the family doctor under the guise of needing to make sure Bianca is in good physical health. Dr. Dagmar suggests to Gus and Karin that Bianca is here for a reason and they should just ride it out. She asks Lars to come in once a week to make sure Bianca is all right. While they wait for the treatments to take effect Dagmar and Lars get a chance to talk and voil Lars is in counseling without him even knowing it.Karin wants to do what is best for Lars. Gus just wants this little problem to go away. This is making it all too apparent that maybe things aren't all right with this family. On the positive side Lars starts spending more time around other people. People of the town including preachers hairdressers and hospital workers all treat Bianca as if she is real. This seems to give Lars to courage to come out of his shell but he isn't the only one who changes.Bianca helps this community and this family come together in unexpected ways. The acting is superb. Ryan Gosling as Lars is sure to get an Oscar nomination. Paul Schneider as Gus is the perfect brother who would rather bury painful issues than deal with them. Patricia Clarkson as Dr. Dagmar is a truly compassionate doctor that would put any counselor to shame.Lars and the Real Girl has now moved up to my top favorite movies of all time. Anyone who sees this movie will be pleasantly surprised. During the movie I saw one couple get up and leave. I have no idea what they could have been offended about. There is nothing sexual or gross about this movie. The blowup doll merely becomes a physical embodiment of one man's terrible loneliness in a world where he was heartlessly abandoned.".

Being the gentleman that he is Lars asks Gus and Karin if his quest can stay in the main house until they get to know each other better. This sets off a chain of events that involve the local doctor minister his coworkers and ultimately the entire town.It's a story of openness and the importance of allowing what you first think is unacceptable and different is actually completely acceptable. The film draws you in changes your initial beliefs and provides a wonderful message at the same time. It's a heartwarming feel good film that will stay with you long after you leave the theater.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this movie last night with friends and I'll admit I'd never heard of it. I knew it was worth watching when I was told Ryan Gosling was in it so I was mildly excited to see it. The first thirty minutes of the film are pretty damn funny and to some almost hilarious. Very well done comedic acting that is real believable and still amazing to watch. Part of what makes the first thirty minutes so funny is because we know about the doll and we can't wait for the first reactions. After that the story takes a wonderfully surprising turn to a really touching light drama. I was very surprised but I really loved it. A lot of people laughed throughout the film and I was very much bothered by that. There is a reason this man is pretending that a sex doll is a real person and its a very internal serious pain thats hes going through which for me understanding that part of the story I felt it was mildly inappropriate for people to laugh but I understood with time. Near the end of the film it gets a little predictable for one some would say major plot turn but not so predictable as to ruin it. About 5 to 10 minutes before it happens you see it coming but other than that it was superbly acted by Ryan Gosling who has nothing but an incredible career in front of him and good supporting roles as well. This is a very enjoyable film which I recommend to anyone and everyone. It really seems to have something for everyone but be prepared it might make you laugh cry or both. Its a very very good movie and definitely worth seeing in theaters.".

There is a reason this man is pretending that a sex doll is a real person and its a very internal serious pain thats hes going through which for me understanding that part of the story I felt it was mildly inappropriate for people to laugh but I understood with time. Near the end of the film it gets a little predictable for one some would say major plot turn but not so predictable as to ruin it. About 5 to 10 minutes before it happens you see it coming but other than that it was superbly acted by Ryan Gosling who has nothing but an incredible career in front of him and good supporting roles as well. This is a very enjoyable film which I recommend to anyone and everyone. It really seems to have something for everyone but be prepared it might make you laugh cry or both. Its a very very good movie and definitely worth seeing in theaters.";

Ryan Gosling's performance hearkens back an equally moving and effective performance from Peter Sellers in Being There which Gosling and director Craig Gilespie admitted was about their only reference point. Gosling's character is sweet good natured and painfully shy and is the heart and soul of this film. His performance as Lars along with patient direction and a wonderful script is the prime reason that it all works. I laughed HARD throughout but by the end I shed real tears over the plot and characters  and I thought doing so over a talking pig was bad! This is a performance WAY out of the ordinary for Gosling and most of today's young actors could not have pulled it off. Expect an Oscar nomination for Gosling and for the screenplay.".

	schema:reviewBody "We saw Lars and the Real Girl at Cinema Sundays at the Charles here in Baltimore MD USA. Audience reaction was great at the screening we saw. Like Little Miss Sunshine with which it shares some characteristics it more fun to watch in an auditorium full of people. Don't wait for the DVD.It starts off funny very funny. You probably know that the movie is about a lonely guy Lars played by Ryan Gosling who gets a lifesized anatomically correct doll.Emily Mortimer and Paul Schneider play Lars's sisterinlaw Karin and brother Gus. Karin especially has been trying to get Lars to come to breakfast or dinner to come out of his shell and Gus also wants his little brother to be closer. Lars is painfully isolated from Karin and Gus. Still nothing is as funny as pain! Lars tells Karin and Gus that he has a visitor Bianca from Brazil. Of course at this point you're wondering what in the world he's doing! You don't tell people that you have a love doll  you keep it secret. Especially Karin's reaction at seeing Lars sitting next to his new friend in their living room is hilarious. The film milks the crowd reaction for a while as numerous people encounter Lars and Bianca and it doesn't stop being funny. At this point begins the magic of this movie.I'm reminded of Purple Rose of Cairo as well as Buckaroo Banzai because both movies expanded the definition for me of what a movie could do. In this case the magic is that in this small town in the north of North America Is it in Canada? The American Midwest? people are willing under the leadership of the town physician magnificently played by Patricia Clarkson to accept Lars's new friend as a member of the community. This walks a very fine line and that it succeeds so magnificently is a tribute to the director veteran commercial director Craig Gillespie the actors main and supporting characters and most of all the writer Nancy Oliver whose previous experience consists primarily of scripts for HBO's Six Feet Under. The writing is magnificent. I like this for Best Original Screenplay. Aside from the way the story develops and the many little funny and warm moments much of the dialog is memorable and beautifully written. Comparisons to Arthur Miller and Tenessee Williams come to mind.The magic of this movie is that it makes you laugh at what happens when a guy pretends that a doll is a real person and then it makes you stop laughing and well let's just say I wasn't the only one sniffling and blowing my nose in the audience! And even then it was funny! It took me to a new place.Although this film may attract some viewers because of the naughty subject matter the sexiest it gets is when Lars's coworker Margo cuteasabutton Kelli Garner shimmies after bowling a strike. Really there's not a crude or offcolor moment in the film. It's rated PG13 and I believe 12yearolds will get most of it and enjoy it as well.Not unlike Little Miss Sunshine Lars uses an ensemble cast a director not previously known for feature films and a fantastic script to make a groundbreaking comedy with a huge amount of heart. Like posters in IMDb's Message Board section I agree that word of mouth will be kind to this movie. I believe that if it goes into wide release it will do very very well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ryan Gosling plays Lars a man with a severe social disorder. He usually avoids contact with people even his brother Paul Schneider and sisterinlaw Emily Mortimer. But then Lars orders a sex doll from the internet and he pretends that she is real and is his girlfriend. The local doctor Patricia Clarkson suggests that everyone in the small town in which they live go along with the delusion hoping Lars is just working things out in his head. It's kind of a cute concept but honestly I could never buy into it. First off before the sex doll arrives Lars seems weird but not so crazy as to do as he does. A person so removed from reality probably wouldn't attend church every week and certainly wouldn't be able to hold down a regular job in an office. And while I might buy that some of the people close to Lars would go along with the game it's not easy to buy that everyone in town would be happy about it. There are numerous scenes with the town's children the most literalminded members of the human species sitting around not even questioning the situation including one bizarre scene in which she is supposedly reading aloud to kids without Lars even there. Then there's this one character played by the lovely young Kelli Garner who has a crush on Lars from the beginning of the film. Instead of reacting with horror at Lars's girlfriend and running away she is while at first shocked eventually charmed by it. People just don't act like real people in this film. And even if I could buy into it all I felt that the film was too repetitive always cutting to unfunny reaction shots of a new person meeting Bianca which is what Lars calls the doll or even less funny reaction shots of the doll itself. The performances are generally good. I think Gosling who was fantastic in his Oscarnominated performance in Half Nelson relies a bit too much on method acting with his constant blinking and whatnot. One might call him Chaplinesque at times like in the scene where he pretends to bring Garner's teddy bear back to life. But I was more thinking of Johnny Depp pretending to be Chaplin in Benny  Joon which is a similar but much better movie. The only actor who rises above the mediocre material is Emily Mortimer who is the only one in my opinion who sells the concept. I really believed that she would care enough about her brotherinlaw to go along with his delusion. It's her finest performance yet in a career I'm sure will become much bigger.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Lars and the Real Girl";
	schema:reviewBody "I'd bet almost everyone during their childhood years would have interacted with their toys somehow be it outwardly verbal or playing it all in the mind. Conversations with dolls teddy bears or even with G.I. Joe himself beating up Cobra Commander these are stuff of what a rich imagination would be made of breathing a form of consciousness onto inanimate objects.Some kids don't grow up of course retaining their childlike mannerisms within a grown up body. Ryan Gosling's Lars is a gentle softspoken man extremely shy but ever ready with a warm smile that can melt the sternest of hearts and when nervous or anxious blinks hard. Living in the garage by choice of a house occupied by brother Gus Paul Schneider and his wife Karin Emily Mortimer we learn that Lars has a condition of being delusional and his extreme introversion causes him to absolutely abhor signs of affection.It's been a while since I remembered a movie having a central character spending much time interacting with an object the most memorable of course would be Tom Hanks' Chuck Noland being castaway on an island and finding companionship with Wilson the volleyball. Here Lars finds a new security blanket in his mail order sex doll he christians Bianca which is highly customizable anatomically correct and quite attractive to boot. Furthermore it's not just one character that gets all emotional with it in fact the entire small midwestern town does where everybody indulges Lars and his new friend at first to curious stares but slowly warming up to even Bianca as well as their tender reactions now turn into immense efforts bringing Lars out of the shell.And would you believe that the director for Mr. Woodcock helmed this movie? I suppose one would have imagined that with a plot device like a sex doll it will be extremely easy to traverse down the path of comedy. However Lars and the Real Girl avoided that with a ten foot pole being contemplative and for the most parts surprisingly quiet. It's a sublimely warmhearted movie about community love and relationships forged under trying circumstances. It's unconventional in its approach to conventional themes and therein lies its wonderful charm with a pinch of quirkiness.Those who have enjoyed Ryan Gosling's performance in Half Nelson will find that he's again in fine form and personally I felt he did much better here. He brings out the innocence of Lars succinctly and his performance will without a doubt touch many with his earnestness in being a Boo Radley without illintentions to people around him and wanting to be left alone doing his own thing. It might seem like a one man show again but the supporting casts are given ample opportunity to shine and complement Gosling with Emily Mortimer being the ever supportive pillar of strength in the household juggling all the weirdness with her pregnancy and Paul Schneider the opposite a skeptic who feels responsible and remorseful for Lars' condition. Patricia Clarkson and Kelli Garner play the other women in Lars' life the former the psychologist treating his condition and the latter a coworker who's equally shy in expressing her true feelings for this manchild.The power of the mind and imagination to say that it's powerful would be a gross understatement and to witness how honest emotions get to conquer mental conditions is indeed a joy to behold. Lars and the Real Girl succeeds in being mature about the treatment and having a great cast deliver the goods superbly is already a major plus. Should you not want to sit through another teenage sexromp comedy like Superbad then let not the notion of having a sexdoll on screen turn you away as you'll be pleasantly surprised by the end results. Recommended!P.S. Like Knocked Up which featured a real site in Mr Skin those smitten with Bianca will be happy to know the site featured in the movie is real too though a standard real doll will set you back by about US7K no less. As I know I have readers in their teens I will not be adding actual links to the websites mentioned here.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'd bet almost everyone during their childhood years would have interacted with their toys somehow be it outwardly verbal or playing it all in the mind. Conversations with dolls teddy bears or even with G.I. Joe himself beating up Cobra Commander these are stuff of what a rich imagination would be made of breathing a form of consciousness onto inanimate objects.Some kids don't grow up of course retaining their childlike mannerisms within a grown up body. Ryan Gosling's Lars is a gentle softspoken man extremely shy but ever ready with a warm smile that can melt the sternest of hearts and when nervous or anxious blinks hard. Living in the garage by choice of a house occupied by brother Gus Paul Schneider and his wife Karin Emily Mortimer we learn that Lars has a condition of being delusional and his extreme introversion causes him to absolutely abhor signs of affection.It's been a while since I remembered a movie having a central character spending much time interacting with an object the most memorable of course would be Tom Hanks' Chuck Noland being castaway on an island and finding companionship with Wilson the volleyball. Here Lars finds a new security blanket in his mail order sex doll he christians Bianca which is highly customizable anatomically correct and quite attractive to boot. Furthermore it's not just one character that gets all emotional with it in fact the entire small midwestern town does where everybody indulges Lars and his new friend at first to curious stares but slowly warming up to even Bianca as well as their tender reactions now turn into immense efforts bringing Lars out of the shell.And would you believe that the director for Mr. Woodcock helmed this movie? I suppose one would have imagined that with a plot device like a sex doll it will be extremely easy to traverse down the path of comedy. However Lars and the Real Girl avoided that with a ten foot pole being contemplative and for the most parts surprisingly quiet. It's a sublimely warmhearted movie about community love and relationships forged under trying circumstances. It's unconventional in its approach to conventional themes and therein lies its wonderful charm with a pinch of quirkiness.Those who have enjoyed Ryan Gosling's performance in Half Nelson will find that he's again in fine form and personally I felt he did much better here. He brings out the innocence of Lars succinctly and his performance will without a doubt touch many with his earnestness in being a Boo Radley without illintentions to people around him and wanting to be left alone doing his own thing.

After some shaky scenes where the townspeople start to treat the doll like a real person there's a good scene where the doctor starts to get Lars to open up a bit and we start to understand his character a bit. But then at the end it falls apart completely. It takes a real leap of the imagination to believe that the emergency services would leap into action to save the life of a rubber sex doll. They even give it a hospital bed for God's sake! Then they have a church funeral service and a burial scene where the whole town gets choked up. Lars' brother the only doubter at the start of the movie gets all misty eyed about funerals and actually compares the whole sickening business to when he buried his parents. They were burying a rubber sex toy people!!!This movie can't decide what it wants to be and ends up being nothing.

I am not saying that all films are supposed to conform to reality but when they don't at least the viewer should not be made to feel stupid. There were some scenes where the director went overboard for example when the ambulance came to take Bianca to the hospital.I felt like my intelligence was being insulted because no matter how much Lars was loved in the community it would never happen it is a waste of time  resources. Also I don't recall anyone making fun of Lars and Bianca in a real life situation there would definitely be some name calling and mockery. I mean for God's sake it's not like they were living in New York this was a small town in the middle of nowhere where people still held very traditional views. Secondly the fact that everyone played along was a bit disturbing. I mean this was an obviously very sick man and they made the situation worse by joining in the game and depriving him of proper professional treatment. What if he decided not to make Bianca sick what would they have done then??".

	schema:headline " Expert Ensemble Brings a Delicate Heart to a Most Original Work";
	schema:reviewBody "This 2007 film's askew sensibilities and deadpan manner will be familiar to anyone who has watched HBO's Six Feet Under with any regularity since six episodes were written by the film's screenwriter Nancy Oliver. However coupled with Craig Gillespie's thoughtful and gently sauntering direction her script has an added dimension of humanism that grounds the preposteroussounding concept of a socially awkward smalltown bachelor who becomes enamored with a blowup doll. The premise would seem ideal for Jim Carrey or Will Ferrell but this is not a flatout slapstick comedy. It's actually a whimsical allegory that touches on serious issues related to emotional isolation and the unacknowledged inability to handle personal loss.The story focuses on 27year old Lars Lindstrom who lives in a garage apartment next to his older brother Gus and his pregnant wife Karin. Although she is the one who keeps cajoling Lars to join them for dinner and get him out of his shell it is Lars' childish coworker Kurt who inspires him to find a safe way to find a mate  by mail order in a big crate. Enter Bianca the lifelike mannequin whom Lars fantasizes to be a wheelchairbound orphaned registered nurse who happens to be a Brazilian missionary. He is so smitten with Bianca that Gus and Karin both dumbfounded by this turn of events seek the counsel of local physician and psychotherapist Dr. Dagmar who recognizes Lars' dependence on Bianca as a serious mental illness that will require the rest of the town to treat Bianca as if she is alive. This is when the movie charms the most as if we have entered a Frank Capra alternauniverse of unconditional goodwill. The treat is in experiencing how far Gillespie Oliver and the cast are willing to take us in having us embrace Bianca as a vital member of the community and how events being to challenge Lars' lifelong insulation from the rest of the world.Ideal casting has a lot to do with this special film's success beginning with Ryan Gosling's lowwattage turn as Lars. Although his emphatic blinking is a bit too theatrical a tic for such a potentially cartoonish character the versatile actor Half Nelson manages to internalize Lars' pain in subtle often painstaking ways. His quiet performance also helps make this movie much more of a seamless ensemble piece than it could have been with outstanding work from Paul Schneider smitten cop Brad in The Family Stone as Gus in mercurial states of confusion frustration and familial guilt Emily Mortimer the clueless wife Chloe in Woody Allen's Match Point submerging her Britishness to bring a convincing eagertoplease freshness to Karin the always dependable Patricia Clarkson as the almost matteroffact Dr. Dagmar and Kelli Garner unrecognizable as the sickly Calista in Dreamland best of all as Lars' perky infatuated coworker Margo. This is a film that brings unexpected joy through a level of character nuance too rarely found in American films today. At the same time while it skirts the issue of mental illness it does approximate its profound effects through its small lifesize moments rather than dramatically manipulative scenes. This one is a gem.".

A church going cubicle office worker who lives in the garage of a house that was left to him and his married brother by his recently departed parents.First off he introduces his new 'friend' to his brother and sister in law as Bianca a half Brazilian half Danish visitor to the US who has just had her luggage stolen on arrival into the country. Both being religious and old fashioned in their views he asks if Bianca can stay in the house with his brother and sister in law. Next he asks his sister in law to lend Bianca some clothes. The brother points out the obvious and states that Bianca is plastic. The reply by Lars is Yes she is shy and doesn't speak much.The movie if not bizarre enough by this stage gets even more way out. Suddenly this shy quiet boy who wouldn't say boo to a goose becomes the town's hero due to his pragmatic approach to his new 'girlfriend'. Bianca is given a job asked to volunteer in the local hospital and is even invited out on a girls night. Lars response to this instead of saying Hey you fools I'm just kidding she's just a doll is one of jealousy that his girlfriend has made plans that do not include him.All along it's pretty obvious that Bianca is Lars way of practicing his social skills with women before actually going on a date at the age of 27. What is more than a little absurd is that there is a girl in town who despite the fact that Lars is dating is sex toy is actually interested in him.After an evening bowling with his new friend Lars comes back to discover that his inanimate girlfriend is unconscious. By the time we arrive at this point in the movie the whole town including the local church goers Lars' work colleagues and his family are all going along with the pretense. Suddenly Bianca belongs to an HMO and has medical insurance. An ambulance with active medics transports Bianca to the local hospital hooked up to a drip. On arrival Lars is told that he cannot be present during the initial examination. Lars then decides that Bianca is dying. The doctor a character who is also counseling Lars all the way through the movie allows Lars to take Bianca home to die. This is probably the second freakiest part of the movie.Here comes the freakiest scene. After Bianca dies you guessed it there's a funeral and a burial. Maybe the movie is just a complete escape from reality. Maybe Lars is the only normal guy in the whole town. Maybe the mayor is an action figure and the police carry water pistols. Maybe society should treat people in the way that Bianca was accepted by the town. Are there morals to be learned from this movie or is this just too way out and wacky? Maybe it takes a better person than myself to even begin to fathom out what the writer was trying to prove.

All in all apart from excellent acting by Ryan Gosling the actual storyline itself was just too weird for words.";

	schema:reviewBody "Flower Drum Song holds a special place for me because it was the first Broadway show I ever saw. And I don't think it's been given the proper place in the pantheon of RodgersHammerstein shows. Back then minority players had a hard time getting parts and Flower Drum Song certainly filled a need there in the same way Porgy and Bess has done for black people. This was the first time a Broadway show was completely cast with oriental players. A milestone not to be overlooked.Several of the Broadway cast made it to the film version. Juanita Hall Patrick Adiarte Keye Luke and most of all Miyoshi Umeki repeated their roles. Miyoshi was very big news then. When I saw the play she had just won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Sayonara. Also a significant milestone very significant in the repair of Japanese American relations from World War II. Jack Soo also made it from Broadway. But on Broadway the future Detective Nick Yemana of the bad coffee was the Commodore from the Chinese nightclub. Here he is one of the male leads in a part originated by Larry Blyden on Broadway. Soo's deadpan delivery that made him so popular on Barney Miller is working undertime here. If you liked him on Barney Miller he's great here.James Shigeta took the place of one Ed Kenney from Broadway. Shigeta was at the start of a long career as probably THE Oriental leading man in American films for many years. The big hit song from Flower Drum Song is I Enjoy Being a Girl which was and is the antibattle cry against feminism. Doris Day had a big hit record of it she would but today feminists would be picketing the show with the message that conveys. I mean really the goal of the American woman is to be barefoot and pregnant at the home of a brave and free male. Gloria Steinem would have cardiac arrest.Nancy Kwan does wonderfully in the role of Linda Low who lip syncs those sentiments previously mentioned. Right around this time Kwan France Nuyen and Nobu McCarthy all came along at the same time and seemed to battle for the same parts.Two songs that are overlooked gems are You Are Beautiful which Johnny Mathis sang beautifully on record and Love Look Away. The latter is sung offscreen by Metropolitan Opera diva Marilyn Horne. That's not to be missed.And neither is Flower Drum Song.".

	schema:headline " New DVD Resuscitates Rodgers and Hammerstein's Quaintly Entertaining EastMeetsWest Musical";
	schema:reviewBody "As a JapaneseAmerican raised in the 1960's I always had mixed feelings about the 1961 film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ChineseAmerican musical comedy. Although it was refreshing to see so many Asian faces in a mainstream studio movie granted several JapaneseAmerican actors in Chinese roles the portrayals always struck me as trite and catering to preexisting stereotypes. Now that it has finally come out on DVD fortyfive years after its initial release I can appreciate it much more without raising my eyebrows as much perhaps because it now seems so much a nostalgic product of Eisenhowerera sensibilities. Another reason is that the DVD contains a pristine print that balances the saturated use of color throughout. Moreover there is the music which while not gradeA material from the legendary team has enough of their recognizably melodious style to make the whole affair quite entertaining now.Set in San Francisco's Chinatown in the late 1950's the souffllight story written by Joseph Fields is a familyoriented musicalchairs romantic comedy focused on EastWest cultural differences primarily in the welltodo Wang household headed by the ultratraditional Master Wang. It starts with pretty Mei Li who has stowed away on a Chinese steamer with her professor father to become a mailorder bride for nightclub owner Sammy Fong. En route they end up staying in the Wang home where she develops a crush on eldest son Wang Ta. But he is infatuated with saucy showgirl Linda Low who is intent on making Sammy jealous enough for him to propose after five years of noncommitment. Wang Ta and Linda turn out to be a mismatch which would be good news if only Mei Li's marriage contract were not so binding. If that situation is not complicated enough dressmaker Helen Chao has a lifelong crush on Wang Ta as well.An allAsian cast was assembled a rarity in itself back then and it helps that most perform within the constraints of the movie quite well. Looking like a porcelain doll brought to life Miyoshi Umeki lends her uniquely plaintive quality to the role of Mei Li and she sings with quiet clarity on her trademark song A Hundred Million Miracles. As Wang Ta James Shigeta also a pleasant singer is sincere with the matine idol looks to match although his nave character seems excessively dim when it comes to women. Both however are overshadowed by the shenanigans provided by Nancy Kwan at her pinup cutie peak as Linda and Jack Soo in full Dean Martin mode as the cynical Sammy. Even though their stormy relationship seems to be lifted completely from Nathan and Adelaide's in Guys and Dolls they provide the lion's share of the entertainment with the domestic fantasy Sunday a particular highlight.While dubbed Kwan performs the boudoir classic I Enjoy Being a Girl with sexy flair and she dances with graceful exuberance on Fan Tan Fannie and especially on Grand Avenue with a virtual battalion of dancers. Benson Fong who memorably played Charlie Chan's 3 son in his youth brings the necessary bluster to Master Wang while Juanita Hall Bloody Mary from South Pacific stays mainly on the sidelines as the understanding Auntie Liang except when she solos on Chop Suey. Of the supporting cast two performers stand out  teenaged Patrick Adiarte dancing energetically as younger son Wang Tan and as the lovelorn Helen Reiko Sato leads a stunning ballet on the show's best song Love Look Away her voice is dubbed by legendary soprano Marilyn Horne. The opening credits showcase a series of striking watercolor paintings from artist Dong Kingman and Russell Metty's richly colorful cinematography can finally be appreciated with the DVD.The 2006 DVD extras are generous starting with a solid commentary track from Kwan and British film historian Nick Redman. Even though Kwan sometimes gets derailed by her life story she and Redman partner well in bringing out intriguing aspects of the production and cast. There are five featurettes which feel like components of one featurelength documentary since the same participants show up in all five. The first one talks about the story's transition from the original novel by C.Y. Lee to the Broadway musical directed by Gene Kelly to the 1961 movie to the 2002 Broadway revival developed by David Henry Hwang. The other shorts focus on the casting the score sets and costumes and a more personal look at Rodgers and Hammerstein. It's interesting how veteran filmmaker Henry Koster is barely mentioned since he directed the film though his pedestrian direction is truly the least impressive part of the movie.".

	schema:headline " What my Chinese PRC wife thought of FDS";
	schema:reviewBody "Speaking for myself I have been a huge fan of FDS since the '70s when I bought the soundtrack album on Decca at a used record store for 7. I saw it on TV one new years day i think 1980 and it's been one of my favorites ever since. Not only is it one of R and H's best scores Alfred Newman's arrangements are simply lush and beautiful. The cast and the director are all top notch. The screen play is delightful perhaps a bit long but rather too long than eliminate one of the great songs some of which were already edited down from the original Broadway version which was directed by the great Gene Kelly. I have often wondered what would have happened if he had directed the movie. On stage I do like the full two versions of The Other Generation for example.My wife is from the Peoples Rep. of China. Shes 28 and has been in the USA for 15 months as of this writing. I was going through my stuff recently in storage and came across of my heavily yellowed copy of CY Lee's novel FDS and thought my wife would enjoy it. She did. So i thought well now it's time to break out my old VHS copy which i hadn't seen since 1990. it was playable but storage hasn't been very kind to it. C'Mon DVD!!!Her final comment was cute. Benson Fong's Mr. Wang reminded her of her own father. Even though my wonderful father in law is a hard line communist I see the obvious paternal controlling similarities between them. He made her very nostalgic for her home land and her family. If we ever have any sons he will probably be like Wang San in many ways and she could see the old man's reaction to his youngest son's could be very similar between her father and our son yet to be conceived.What she thought was laughably bad was A Hundred Million Miracles trying to be passed off as a real flower drum song. She said if they sung that in China as a flower drum song they would have been stoned to death. She almost lost interest in the movie at that point especially since the movie and original play deviate from the novel at that point. So she didn't buy that at all. Sammy Fong's lecherous behavior was also realistic for a Chinese businessman. My wife related to that too.She didn't buy some of the costuming especially young women wearing hats. Married women wore hats in the '50s but Mei Li apparently wouldn't.Speaking of Mei Li she totally bought her character both in the book and the movie. Very realistic portrayal and Miyoshi looked like a typical peasant girl albeit Miyoshi is Japanese not Chinese and that was evident immediately.Linda Low though not a big part of the novel if at all I have forgotten if that character appears in it was another realistic character even today in 2006!! She reminded both us of well... shall we say... materialistic girls you could meet everyday in Shanghai the ones that unsuspecting foreigners need to be careful of. In any event Nancy Kwan has another fan in my wife. We have a copy of Suzie Wong  book and movie  in China.For myself it was interesting seeing the movie after having lived three years in the PRC and what an admirable job the creators of the movie did in keeping with the culture. They missed a few things obviously but for two Jewish boys from NYC R and H as well as Joseph Fields libretto did an awesome job of keeping it real much more so here than with the King and I which both play and movie are banned forever in Thailand because the Thai people find it so offensive.As far as David Hwang's remake of FDS goes I really can't comment on it because I haven't read it or seen it. I don't know if I really want to although I am curious just because I have been a supporter of FDS for so many years. If the idea for the remake is to resemble the novel more than I am all for it. I love the novel and I think the original play and movie missed opportunities for beefing up the Helen Chao character better. She just kinds of disappears with no mention of her suicide after the hauntingly beautiful Love Look Away a show stopper if there ever was one. That is a flaw. I just love Sammy Fong. How can you have FDS without Sammy Fong? He is just so sleazy and brilliant and wonderful invention by the creative team. How can you do FDS without 'the other generation in any version. That's the whole point of the both the novel and the original play as well as the movie  the generation gap and the cultural gap. In portraying that FDS the original play and movie succeed on pretty much every level If the idea to create a new version of FDS was because the movie and play portrayed negative stereotypes my wife who is Chinese has to disagree. She loves the characters in this movie in many ways they brought China to life for her and what it is like living in a totally new culture not understanding anything at all or in her case thinking you know a foreign culture because you have worked with foreigners and finding it's completely different over here.Kudos and thank you to RandH Ross Hunter and his team in creating a movie that has aged so gracefully as has Ms. Kwan for the most part and making serious cultural and generational issues that will probably never go away fun. This movie will be current in 100 years.".

	schema:headline " A Great Musical from the Early Sixties";
	schema:reviewBody "This one takes me right back to the sixties when we were young and full of hope for the future. We saw it as a first run movie at Graumann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood and loved it. Even today on the television set it holds up well and the overture just jumps out at you. Soon you hear A Hundred Million Miracles with dolllike Miyoshi Umeki and other great songs like Love Look Away and Sunday. The choreography is as impressive as the music in particular the erotic dance sequence for Love Look Away with beautiful Reiko Sato as Helen. Her unrequited love for Ta James Shigeta is never neatly resolved unlike the film's other romantic relationships and unfortunately she died in real life only twenty years later. Nancy Kwan as Linda Low of course looks great sings well and slinks around very nicely as do the many other lovely Asian dancers who grace this testament to Chinese American culture and oriental beauty. The funniest and best acting came from old man Wang played by Benson Fong. He complained to his wife's sister Juanita Hall that after five long years of citizenship school the only thing she could say about America was This isn't China! And when asked to describe the mugger who had robbed him on his doorstep he replied simply How should I know. All white men look alike. James Shigeta and Jack Soo handed in memorable performances as well. The former became one of the most successful and consistently employed oriental actors in American film and television while the latter went on to play Nick Yemana on Barney Miller. Although there are some corny aspects to Flower Drum Song these are more than counterbalanced by the many interesting elements that occur throughout the movie. In short it's a sort of Joy Luck Club of the early sixties on a similar level and released about the same time as South Pacific and West Side Story. A couple of years later America was again impacted by the Orient. The beautiful song Sukiyaki an imported hit from Japan went to number one on the American pop charts. We had our problems in those days but culturally speaking it was a great time to be alive.".

The score contains a few great numbers like Love Look Away and I Enjoy Being a Girl In spite of the sexist lyrics it's a fun song but overall is not as good as other Rodgers and Hammerstein scores.  But there is still much to like and enjoy in this charming film version of RH's Broadway hit.  The cast is great and includes several veterans of the Broadway show most notably former Oscarwinner Miyoshi Umecki who is utterly enchanting as Mei Li completely rising above the characterization of a placid picture bride who just sort of goes with the flow and doesn't question any of her superiors men with a performance that is sweetly comical and even a little touching at times. Other Broadway veterans Patrick Adiarte You would never guess he was the same guy who was that annoying Crown Prince in the movie of The King and I and Juanita Hall from South Pacific are likewise great and Jack Soo is hilarious as the hip deadpan Sammy Fong.  Of the actors chosen just for the film James Shigeta has a pleasent voice and acting style as Wang Ta and Benson Fong is good enough in the rather stereotypical role of the stubbornly traditionalist Chinese father.  As for Nancy Kwan as Linda Low she is rather wooden as an actress and must've been an even worse singer As she was dubbed by BJ Baker but does a great job dancing in the nightclub sequences.  But yes Pat Suzuki from the Broadway show would've been a much better choice judging by the original cast recording.  Reiko Sato is pretty good as Helen Chao and Marilyn Horne does a beautiful job of dubbing her in Love Look Away.  Aside from the great cast the orchestrations are wonderful and better than the Broadway arrangements and the choreography by Hermes Pan is really really good.  This is one of the more faithful filmizations of a Broadway show aside from cutting one song The forgettable Like a God reordering a few others and throwing in a few new scenes.  And while perhaps Rodgers and Hammerstein couldn't quite bring the depth to this story of Chinese immigrants adjusting to life in San Francisco's Chinatown they did it with great charm and overall respect. There are many delights in the score such as A Hundred Million Miracles the hilarious Don't Marry Me Sunday Grant Avenue and the lovely You Are Beautiful.  Even if these are not on a level with the other RH scores they are wellwritten and memorable.  Truly an underrated film that deserves another look.  Right now in Los Angeles a new revival of the stage version with a completely new book by AsianAmerican playwright David Henry Hwang is appearing possibly on its way to Broadway.  It makes sense to finally have this story told from a truly AsianAmerican perspective and hopefully though some of Hwang's choices sound a bit odd Putting in something about CHinese opera cutting Sammy Fong and the whole Other Generation song and idea which is pretty crucial to the original and making Mei Li a refugee from Chinese Communism hopefully this new version will further allow people to reconsider their view of this show and its film version.".

Right now in Los Angeles a new revival of the stage version with a completely new book by AsianAmerican playwright David Henry Hwang is appearing possibly on its way to Broadway.  It makes sense to finally have this story told from a truly AsianAmerican perspective and hopefully though some of Hwang's choices sound a bit odd Putting in something about CHinese opera cutting Sammy Fong and the whole Other Generation song and idea which is pretty crucial to the original and making Mei Li a refugee from Chinese Communism hopefully this new version will further allow people to reconsider their view of this show and its film version.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen the revival of the 1958 RH musical and did not appreciate it one bit. The original story is so charming with a lovely score and sympathetic and enchanting characters. I don't understand all of this nonsense about stereotypes. In the film all of the characters are fully realized three dimensional characters. I agree with what the former poster has to say about the 1961 film. Very true to the original play though I would opine that the original cast orchestrations are better than those of the film. Fine performances by a darling Miyoshi Umeki seemingly servile but full of pluck and guts and insight in her own quiet way. Nancy Kwan looks beautiful as Linda Low and Jack Shoo and the handsome James Shigata as the romantic lead are wonderfully cast. Juanita Hall steals every scene she is in and Benson Fong is superb as the traditional but very wise father who really does have his son's interest and happiness at heart.Seems to me that these are universals not endemic to any one group. I just do not understand all of the fuss about updating the book. The Other Generation is cut from the updated version. Was that song a slur against Chinese Americans in the late 1950's? Seems to me that in another Broadway classic Bye Bye Birdie which opened in the spring of 1960  white bread American parents lamented the other generation in a diddy called Kids. It was the zeitgeist of the late Eisenhower era and the fall out from rock and roll and the huge impact a fellow called Elvis made in these United States.Ancient Chinese saying goes If it ain't broke don't fix it. In these troubled times Broadway audiences would have appreciated a slightly tweaked and updated version of this 1958 gem of a show. David Hwang Ho has really taken it to the extreme. So if you want to real flavor the original stick with the film and the wonderful characters who inhabit the wonderful Chinatown and Grant Avenue San Francisco California USA in those halcyon Kennedy years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Flower Drum song is one of those movies that I think was very overlooked by the public and also the Academy. Miyoshi Umeki deserved at least an Academy Awards nomination. She carries this film and I can't imagine anyone playing the role more to perfection. Juanita Hall is fantastic and I wish there was more screen time with her and the others are well cast. My only complaint with casting is Jack Soo. In the Broadway version he played the singer in the nightclub and on that cast CD he is a terrible singer. For the movie somehow he was promoted to one of the leads and his singing was not dubbed. I think his acting is just OK but his singing STINKS and for me ruined the 2 songs Sunday and my favorite Don't Marry me. How Richard Rodgers was OK with not dubbing his singing is beyond me.There are some pretty jazzed up orchestrations which work well in Grant Avenue and Chop Suey but some orchestrations are better in the Broadway version again Sunday and Don't Marry Me.. The set design and cinematography are excellent and Rodgers and Hammerstein's score is in my opinion up there with their best. Most of the songs from the Broadway version except one were left intact and some expanded. Note that Universal gave the makers one of the biggest budgets and it shows in a good way. The sound recording on this soundtrack is superb making for what will be I hope a great DVD.This is a fantastic movie sadly unavailable in any widescreen version and no DVD release at all which is sad considering it became Universal's top grosser when it was released and is the only RH film that has not been issued on DVD. This was the only Rodgers and Hammerstein movie not produced and released by 20th Century Fox and I wish it had been because then we would have a DVD.Highly recommend this movie just sit back enjoy some great musical numbers acting and a unique and involving story.".

While the material is in no way the strongest Flower Drum Song is a total charmer and the film version keeps all the charm in tact. Keeping most of the original cast was a smart move Myoshi Umeki is perfect as the timid young Mei Li. It's too bad Pat Suzuki couldn't also recreate her role of nightclub singer Linda Low but Nancy Kwan is very amusing in the role. So far this is the only RH film not to have a DVD release the abysmal remake of State Fair was just released which is somewhat surprising since the film is actually considerably stronger than the films of Oklahoma!

So far this is the only RH film not to have a DVD release the abysmal remake of State Fair was just released which is somewhat surprising since the film is actually considerably stronger than the films of Oklahoma! Carousel and South Pacific.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mid 1990s my girlfriend and I were three blocks away from Kearny in the downtown section of San Francisco and it took us an hour to go one block because of Christmas traffic.I tell that story because because Kearny which goes right through Chinatown although it flows well gets more crowded every year and this film even though it was shot on stage does give a bit of a glimpse into early 1960s San Francisco before the civil rights movement and before the more recent techrevolution from the 90s up to this very day. The city was less crowded a bit more friendlier and certainly more affordable. The schism portrayed in this film between immigrant Chinese and those who had been here a few generations since before the gold rush still exists somewhat but isn't quite as pronounced as depicted here. Then again Flower Drum Song is a musical and not exactly an anthropological study of immigrant race trying to meld with their new host nation.The musical numbers are enjoyable the acting is a bit more pronounced than today's less melodrama driven socalled method acting which is a bit welcome. A man gets tired of alleged realistic performances from talent hoping to be remembered for great performances. Flower Drum Song like a lot of movies coming out of Hollywood is meant to show the positive light of Chinese Americans in a time when the world was not interconnected as it is today and in this way is meant to hopefully enlighten nonChinese the nation over and beyond. The more relaxed mind will be tend to be open to the message but my main criticism with a lot of these films is that you'll not crack the hardened bigot no matter how good a show you put on. Even so it's a very enjoyable film though I can guarantee you that Grant Avenue is usually packed and has an odd mix of smells of imported and freshly caught food for restaurants and stores alike. The characters are stock borderline stereotypes at times but otherwise much in the tradition of the film portraying the traditional old guard elders emotionally clashing with their offspring who bring who new ideas and American pop culture to the home. A collision occurs.Do young hearts know what they want? Does father know best? Are traditions the best way to go or is the American way the best way? It's a musical from the late 50s early 60s and the proposition is portrayed in that spirit.If I had one critique it's that the DVD gets a little grainy for the few SFX shots notably for Nancy Kwan's mirror sequence. That and like nearly all musicals of the time the thing is shot entirely on stage which has always been a sore point with me.Otherwise it's a very beautiful film and you should see it at least once. If you like the theatre enjoy a good musical then this will probably prove delightful.Give it a whirl.".

Anyway they spend the next 20 years hiding in the jungle smoking marijuana and enjoying peace. Their hippie friends Julie Hagerty as Petra and Robert Carradine as Sammy remain behind.

They try to reconnect with Ms. Hagerty and Mr. Carradine who have become materialistic yuppies. How can they erase their friends' 1980s brainwashing avoid capture by perseverating FBI man Cliff De Young as Brubaker and stop the war?Aaron Russo and Neil Levy's underrated Rude Awakening certainly doesn't always work but it's funny more often than not. Roberts and Marin are almost a satirical casting injoke sixties meet the eighties. One of the film's most obvious misses is that the main attempt to transcend a 20yeargap is an unconvincing pair of pastedon beards. Although to answer Roberts' later more general question How's my hair? Great. It's impossible to hold back laughing at Marin's first meeting with the fish. But they should have used Don Knotts voice. Of the four hippie friends Carradine's is performancewise most convincing. Check out Louise Lasser as Ronnie's customers! The highlight of the film is a terrific cocktail party hosted by Carradine and uptight wife Cindy Williams as June. They are visited by the Stools Buck Henry as Lloyd and Andrea Martin as April. A cocktail party attended by Cheech Marin Eric Roberts Robert Carradine Buck Henry Cindy Williams and Andrea Martin is every bit as funny as it sounds. If only they could have figured out how to get Lasser there and the overhead mike out. There are enough funny moments all around but the hilarious supporting characterizations by Martin and Williams alone make this well worth watching.

	schema:headline " The protest movement as a backcloth for jokes?";
	schema:reviewBody "The hippie theme fascinates me. Although at the time the movement was too bold for me I keep wondering whether I may have missed something. Thanks to the IMDb I was able to discover the film Rude Awakening for it is advocated by visitors on the message board of the film Hair. I had already watched Hair and was dissatisfied because of its distortion of the original narrative in the musical. On the other hand I really liked the Swedish film Tillsammans Together and appreciated Strawberry Statement. Actually the hippie movement is probably universal although the motorcycle and camper van aspect Easy Rider! appears to be typically American. I guess that the European countries are too small for that. Rude Awakening is presented as a comedy which of course is just an alternative approach to narrate dramatic events. In the story two New York hippies Fred and Hesus have traveled in 1969 to a fictitious Latin American state in order to found a commune in the jungle. They have embraced the soft drug culture and make a living by growing hemp for the production of hashish. By the way in the Netherlands the cultivation of hemp for the production of hash is illegal but the sale of soft drugs isn't. Fred is obviously the leader of the colony and Hesus has become an addicted zombie who takes anything that might be hallucinatory. Although the addiction of Hesus looks hilarious in real life it is fairly commonplace. Therefore his role is perhaps meant to be a warning signal a history of even moderate hash consumption will lead to severe symptoms at old age. In 1989 a CIA agent is fatally wounded by the local revolutionary army and in his last moments hands over to Fred a secret dossier about a forthcoming American invasion. Fred decides to alert the American public and returns to New York together with Hesus who follows him more or less like a pet. Fred reanimates his former contact in the hippie movement notably the former commune members Petra and Sammy. However Petra and Sammy have done extremely well and have made careers for themselves. It is understandable that they are shocked to see their former acquaintances and loathe the appearance of Hesus. But here the story takes a strange turn because suddenly Petra and Sammy regress into their abjured hippie attitude. Clearly Rude Awakening is not meant to be a study of characters. In the mean time the FBI starts to hunt Fred in an attempt to recover the secret dossier. Here Hesus plays a heroic and illogical part when during a gun fight he manages to disarm one of the FBI agents. The quartet decides to occupy the main building on the N.Y. university campus. From its balcony Fred informs the crowd of students about the forthcoming invasion and tries to stir a rebellion. However the times have changed since 1969 and his speech only serves to increase the already bellicose spirit of the American people. An old lady sighs We have not won something for a long time. Fred collapses in despair and loathes his former vegetating life in the jungle. Still he decides to return to the jungle it remains a mystery why but just then a group of students appeals to him for guidance in the renewal of the civil movement. This climax is apparently the definite acknowledgment of the avantgarde function of the movement of 68 and its lasting influence on society. Unfortunately Rude Awakening has too many evident weaknesses. The characters lack logic and depth the dialogs are superficial and childish and many of the events are absurd. Some instances may provide food for thought and meditation like the balcony scene where Fred asks How is my hair? Remember that hair is a symbol of the movement of 68 the name of another hippie film etc. But this is just not enough for a film that pretends to be a reflection on an influential cultural and historical movement. So maybe this protest movement features as nothing more than a backcloth for jokes. Rude Awakening is too lighthearted and senseless for my taste and I recommend Tillsammans or Strawberry Statement instead.".

Next time I was 25 and was bowled over by its imagery and as I've got older come to appreciate it more and more.So much for watching it through a child's eyes and accepting the fantasy at face value! At the beginning Cocteau states Once upon a time... but really for discerning adult cineastes andor poets to drop their guards and enjoy it for what it was  a magical filmic fantasy.

Next time I was 25 and was bowled over by its imagery and as I've got older come to appreciate it more and more.So much for watching it through a child's eyes and accepting the fantasy at face value! At the beginning Cocteau states Once upon a time... but really for discerning adult cineastes andor poets to drop their guards and enjoy it for what it was  a magical filmic fantasy.

	schema:headline " A Great Freudian Fable";
	schema:reviewBody "To a degree of success few films have ever achieved Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast 1946 balances film's opposite yet equal capacities to record life as it is and to create completely imaginary landscapes via editing and optical effects. Most Cocteau films veer heavily toward the fantastic the mythic the poetic or the surrealistic but in Beauty he rendered a mise en scene based largely on 18th century Dutch painting employed an invisible camera and editing style and relied on conventional storytelling techniques in order to make his retelling of the classic fairy tale as realistic as possible. Nevertheless Beauty and the Beast is primarily noted as among the most successful adaptations of a fairy tale ever made and one of the greatest fantasy films of any type. And this is true despite Cocteau's enormous handicap of working in a recently warravaged country with minimal financial and technical resources.One influential and provocative interpretative approach to Beauty and the Beast is through Freudian psychology. From this perspective Beauty's story is a symbolic sexual drama in which a young woman breaks free from a psychologically incestuous relationship with her father and brother? overcomes her fear of male sexuality and of her own and ultimately enters mature womanhood.Strong evidence to support this interpretation can be found in the framing of the film's opening and closing scenes. In the film's opening scene Belle's suitor Avenant shoots a phallic arrow that misses its ostensible target and enters a ladiesonly bedchamber where it lands across the mirror image of Belle on the floor she is polishing. Uninvited Avenant invades the bedchamber retrieves the arrow and uses it to embracerestrain Belle. He then proposes marriage and  when he is denied  forces his attention on Belle with something close to physical assault. From a Freudian perspective Avenant represents the unleashed libido that Belle is not psychologically or culturally prepared to confront directly.Avenant in turn receives his just comeuppance in the film's final scene when he is slain by an arrow from the bow of Diana protector of chastity and the presiding goddess in the Beast's garden pavilion. Entry to this pavilion female sexual nature is permissible only by using a golden key dominion over which the Beast has chivalrously granted to Belle. i.e. the woman says when Yet with the aid of Belle's evil and duplicitous older sisters Avenant comes into false possession of the golden key. This alone would negate the legitimacy of his entry to the pavilion but he decides to enter even more illicitly by smashing the hymenlike glass portal hidden on the building's roof thus prompting his ironic execution via the same phallic symbol with which his pursuit of Belle had begun.This framing symmetry of two spatial violations in the opening and closing scenes of the film is not accidental. It underlines the difference between the Beast's tempered courtly masculinity and Avenant's unrestrained ego and desire. The film ends not only with the Beast's transformation into the handsome prince thanks to Belle's loving gaze but also with the transformation of Avenant into the guise of the beast a physical manifestation of his unrestrained inner animal. That Avenant the Beast and the Prince are played by the same actor suggests their Freudian interplay of id superego and ego  which Belle is also working out in feminine terms as she resists and then accepts the journey from her father's house through the Beast's castle and on to her married royal destiny.Many scenes throughout Beauty and the Beast acquire added depth through a Freudian approach. The cutting of the rose in the Beast's garden for instance can be seen as a symbolic violation that evokes the Beast and begins the liberation of Belle from bondage to her father and evilsister Mother substitutes. Edited in jump cuts the threshold scene when the Beast first carries Belle into her castle bedchamber depicts the repeated transformation of Belle's costume from servantchild to womanbride the very journey she must undertake as she leaves her maidenhood and her father's house and accepts her passage to adult female sexuality and maturity.Belle's journey between the Merchant's house and the Beast's castle is facilitated by two decidedly Freudian symbols of masculine sexuality the horse Magnificent and the Beast's hunting gloves steaming with the blood and scent of his animalmasculine power. Indeed the magic words that Belle must say to prompt Magnificent's gallop back to the castle indicate the psychological necessity of her journey go where I am going! Go go go! The relatively more subtle symbol of the stallion as agent of transportation is later replaced by the glove which not only steams with the Beast's masculine power but which she dons while reclined on the respective beds of her bed chambers in the Castle and the Merchant's house.That Belle's journey of maturation must be undertaken despite her reluctance is most poignantly underscored in the scenes of Belle's return to the Merchant's house after she has lived for a while in the Beast's castle. In her father's house she rapidly regresses to the physical and psychological bondage that had characterized her condition at the beginning of the film  only now the audience if not Belle herself  is painfully aware of the arrested development it represents.Like so many Greta Garbos we want her out of the there and back with the Beast where she belongs!".

Cocteau's genius is that he makes simple editing techniques look like art and in this movie like the combination of art and magic.  Watch what happens when Beauty gives one of her sisters a present from the Beast's castle which the Beast meant only for Beauty.The version I saw was in French with English subtitles but the visuals in glorious black and white are so stunning you could almost cover up the subtitles and still understand what's going on.I can't recommend this movie enough!

	schema:reviewBody "This film immediately captured my attention with the written comments at the beginning of the film. Director Jean Cocteau begins this story by explaining why he wanted to make this film. He talks about the passion behind the picture and all the social unrest at the time. He ends this written dialogue with a comment that will forever remain in my mind. He says ...and now we begin our story with a phrase that is like a time machine for children Once Upon a Time... This just sent chills down my spine. Why? Because although he is addressing children I feel that it is really a phrase meant for all of us. It is used to bring the child out in all of us to show us that we do not need to be 4 or 5 to fully understand the themes of this film ... we are meant to just sit back and let the film take us to another mythological time. The amazing set design also impressed me about this film. Again without the modern conveniences of today's cinema Cocteau had to improvise. This was hard for him to do. Not only were there huge budgetary issues since it was the end of WWII and France was about to be demolished but also he was racing against an impending war. Fear was deep in the hearts of the French after WWII and what a better way to rally your people then with a story about love found in the darkest of places. This film also made me very sad. I am sometimes disgusted with the way that Disney ... for lack of a better word ... Disneyfies their fairy tales. I think after watching this masterpiece I will have trouble ever being able to go back to the computer generated Song as Old as Time version that Disney plastered their trademark to. Never have I been so impressed with black and white cinematography as I have been with this film. The actress that plays Belle Josette Day steals the camera every time it is on her. She looks so radiant with the black and white that to see a colorized version of this film would completely do it injustice. The power and emotion that comes between Belle and the Beast feels so true. Cocteau has somehow grabbed the true feeling of two people that are complete opposites that seem to find true love in the coldest of places. I would be one of those reviewers that believes that if this film were released today it would still pull the audiences in as it did the first time. Only proving that it was made well before it's time it shows so many of the characteristics of the modern day movie. Even the special effects seem perfect for this film. Even with budget being subpar we are able to get a true feeling that this Beast is one of the magical kind. Oh this film was superb. I would have to say that it is the best adaptation of a fairy tale that I have seen today. Definitely my best 40s film made in 1946 and possibly the best telling of Beauty and the Beast EVER!!Grade  out of ".

This movie just seems to have it all it's visuals are very impressive the romance is very charming and not at all phoned in the story is engaging and surprisingly tense and the acting is just superb. Although there are no big movie names you won't care for a second as this talented group will win you completely over.Not only is this fantasy at it's very best it often comes off more as a poem rather than a movie but you won't care. It's one of the most visually dazzling poems ever put on film.".

Its memory remained in my consciousness for about forty years during which time I never once saw the film or even heard about it.  Then I happened to run across it in a catalog.  I just had to have it and ordered it immediately.  It was an incredible experience to see this film again after so many decades and to connect again with my childself.  I could see why the movie had made such an impression on me and haunted me all these years.  As it turned out the film had even more meaning for me as an adult since the main theme had a special personal relevance for me. Amazingly I had also developed an obsession with roses and tended to a garden of hundreds of rose bushes.  All in all a very beautiful film and a simple yet magical tale.".

Each fairy tale addresses a fear they must overcome Hansel and Gretel addresses the fear of abandonment Little Red Riding Hood the fear of the wolf' in the bed sheets and Beauty and the Beast the similar fear of the beast' in men that virgin women face on their wedding night. These tales illustrating the effective resolution of possible threats are very important to natural development.Cocteau's attempt to socialize his female viewers and alleviate their fear of sex is clear through textual analysis. The mirror that Beauty peers into her first night at the castle shows a reflection of her father where her own selfreflection should have been indicating that she is still very much defined by the dominant male role in her life. Almost immediately after the bed sheets slide off the bed in a provocative manner portending future threat and she runs away repulsed. She confronts the Beast and promptly faints. This scene establishes her fear and immaturity however Beauty and the Beast become progressively closer through the film holding hands and talking. During her visit to her family he caresses and wraps himself in her blanket another reference to his association with her bed. When she decides she has remained at home too long she lies on her bed and looks at the beast in the mirror's reflection. This is the point of transition where she links this new dominant male figure to her bed. Instead of being repulsed by his reflection she lovingly caresses the mirror and returns to him. In order to do this she slips on his glove perhaps a reference to condoms. His glove is a perfect fit displaying their perfect compatibility.The Cocteau version of Beauty and the Beast also addresses the dual nature of masculinity where good and evil coexisted and the lines of differentiation are increasingly blurred. He emphasizes his statement that man and beast are indistinguishable by casting Jean Marais in both roles. Beauty comments upon this when she tells the prince that he reminds her of a friend of her brother's. The fine distinction between the two characters is the prince's inner beauty as well as outer. When the brother's friend becomes greedy he transforms into a beast so his inner ugliness and outer appearance coincide.Socialization of Beauty remains central despite two forms of masculinity because the two never meet so Beauty's choice between the two is central. The film is about the distinctions between men and the importance of picking the right one. Since both the friend and the prince have the same attractive male face the lesson is to hold out for the true prince who is good and noble on the inside as well as attractive.As the Beastturnedprince reclaims himself at the end of Cocteau's film the message the audience should take away is that love can cure any ugliness and make any beast a man. The interchangeability is evident and the choice important. Beauty loves the Beast overcoming her fear of the beastly in marriage and claiming she will get used to him the reality of a man. Beauty makes a gradual transition from love of her father to a husband as portrayed in her mirrors depicting her core identity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jean Cocteau famous for this work and for his Orpheus trilogy which includes his breakthrough Blood of a Poet takes the viewer on a journey that he requests at the start to be thought of as a pure fantasy Once Upon a Time and thus the viewer can expect anything from the inventive abstract auteur. There is plenty that Cocteau uses from JeanneMarie Leprince de Beaumont's original story and makes entirely his own with his brand of enlightening the visual medium surrealism in a subtler fashion than in his debut.Most people know the story of Beauty and the Beast even if one hasn't seen the flashy fully romanticized Disney flick an old man in danger of losing most of his earnings goes off one night in the darkness and fog to return home. He's detoured onto the property of the Beast Jean Marais truly with the skills of a stage actor a creature who's been in a world of loneliness and conflict with his primal instincts and his human heart. He lets the old man go as long as he can bring one of his daughters over to take his place.His family includes three daughters two of which are spoiled and another Bela Josette Day who is like the servant of the house to them. Bela agrees and when she arrives at the castle she finds that it's like nothing she's ever seen before arms holding candles statues with eyes and a mirror that can give the Beast sight of Bela when he wants to. The story unfolds as some of us can guess and when Bela returns home to visit her ailing father her descriptions of the Beast as brutish yet cordial and sad infuriates Ludivoic Michael Auclair who's been pining for Bela's hand in marriage. This leads up to an ending we can assume from the start and it may be varied on the viewer whether or not it seems rushed or leaving a loophole or other.Cocteau tells the story with the obvious psychological comparisons between humans and the Beasts in us all and he does so gracefully however he has his collaborators in tuning the right mood Christian Berard Lucien Carre and Rene Moulart combine to create some of the most dankly elegant setsdesign to any film of its time mostly in the rooms of the castle and also in the minor touches of the forests. Their backdrop gives Henri Alekan the motives to add cinematography of a truly evocative timing and grace. He doesn't add or take away shadows in certain scenes to make it more beautiful he adds them so he can apply the right light to the scene and the results only make it all the moreso worthwhile. There was something in me that thought while viewing Beauty and the Beast that this version could be suitable for intelligent children. Now writing this commentary I'm not so sure for American audiences it is a change of pace from filmmakers using he standard visual effects and computer enhancements and I've always been of the opinion that kids need a peek at a few dark movies during their adolescence to prepare them for what's coming up. But it is from a different time has subtitles and the actors sometime seem to inhabit the landscape and involvement of an opera over that of a movie. I can definitely pinpoint this work to rap this up as a highlighted mark in the history of French film with an artist who can take his ideas and transfer them to a past work and make them as palatable and at the least fascinating to the common filmfan as possible for the period it was made.".

There is plenty that Cocteau uses from JeanneMarie Leprince de Beaumont's original story and makes entirely his own with his brand of enlightening the visual medium surrealism in a subtler fashion than in his debut.Most people know the story of Beauty and the Beast even if one hasn't seen the flashy fully romanticized Disney flick an old man in danger of losing most of his earnings goes off one night in the darkness and fog to return home. He's detoured onto the property of the Beast Jean Marais truly with the skills of a stage actor a creature who's been in a world of loneliness and conflict with his primal instincts and his human heart. He lets the old man go as long as he can bring one of his daughters over to take his place.His family includes three daughters two of which are spoiled and another Bela Josette Day who is like the servant of the house to them. Bela agrees and when she arrives at the castle she finds that it's like nothing she's ever seen before arms holding candles statues with eyes and a mirror that can give the Beast sight of Bela when he wants to. The story unfolds as some of us can guess and when Bela returns home to visit her ailing father her descriptions of the Beast as brutish yet cordial and sad infuriates Ludivoic Michael Auclair who's been pining for Bela's hand in marriage. This leads up to an ending we can assume from the start and it may be varied on the viewer whether or not it seems rushed or leaving a loophole or other.Cocteau tells the story with the obvious psychological comparisons between humans and the Beasts in us all and he does so gracefully however he has his collaborators in tuning the right mood Christian Berard Lucien Carre and Rene Moulart combine to create some of the most dankly elegant setsdesign to any film of its time mostly in the rooms of the castle and also in the minor touches of the forests. Their backdrop gives Henri Alekan the motives to add cinematography of a truly evocative timing and grace. He doesn't add or take away shadows in certain scenes to make it more beautiful he adds them so he can apply the right light to the scene and the results only make it all the moreso worthwhile. There was something in me that thought while viewing Beauty and the Beast that this version could be suitable for intelligent children. Now writing this commentary I'm not so sure for American audiences it is a change of pace from filmmakers using he standard visual effects and computer enhancements and I've always been of the opinion that kids need a peek at a few dark movies during their adolescence to prepare them for what's coming up. But it is from a different time has subtitles and the actors sometime seem to inhabit the landscape and involvement of an opera over that of a movie. I can definitely pinpoint this work to rap this up as a highlighted mark in the history of French film with an artist who can take his ideas and transfer them to a past work and make them as palatable and at the least fascinating to the common filmfan as possible for the period it was made.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jean Cocteau's film version of Beauty and the Beast begins in a world that is decidedly hostile to magic. Belle's sisters are materialistic selfish and snobbish her brother gambles in taverns her merchant father talks only about the loss of his ships and her brother's friend Avenant pursues her unromantically. Belle a young woman of extraordinary outer and inner beauty is the only magical or transcendent thing in this society. And it's obvious that she is out of place. Thus when the scene shifts to the Beast's castle the magical imagery is made even more haunting by its contrast to the real world. Words cannot do justice to these fantastical visualsyou must experience them for yourself. Although the special effects were simple even in Cocteau's time he orchestrates them so well and films them in such smoky silvery tones that the result is truly magical. The transformation sequences are still beautiful and surprising the Beast's castle still has its unexplainable mysteries for instance I'm fascinated by his garden which is full of sculptures of dogs.Jean Marais does a wonderful job in his double role the first time I saw the movie I wasn't aware until the very end that Avenant and the Beast were played by the same actor. Despite the heavy makeup he wears as the Beast he uses his eyes and voice to stir up immense pathos. It also adds to the movie's mystery and psychological complexity to have Marais play both of Belle's suitors.While Josette Day who plays Belle never ascends to Marais' heights of emotion you never doubt her essential goodness and inner strength. She too undergoes a transformation from a girl afraid to leave her father's side to a young woman ready to accept romantic love. The actors playing Belle's rascally brother and calculating sisters give lively comic performances.Unfortunately the ending of Beauty and the Beast is rushed and confused as Cocteau tries and fails to follow two plot lines at once. The emotional climax of the fairy tale is the Beast's almost dying only to be redeemed at the last minute by Belle's love but this potentially beautiful moment gets lost in the shuffle. Instead we are left with the disappointing image of the Beast transformed into a rather sugary Prince.A note at the beginning of the film urges us to watch it with a child's sense of wonder not an adult's cynicism. And while it's easy to be cynical about the last few minutes of Beauty and the Beast the rest of the film is so wondrous that it renders this note unnecessary.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching this in my college French class I have mixed feelings. Part of me wants to love it because of the trippy fantastical visuals the fabulous costumes and the surreal music. The other part of me rebels against the blatant overacting the cringeworthy dialog and the ridiculously cheesy and unbelievable ending...To be fair to Cocteau it's a beautiful film. The visuals and music are far ahead of their time. I'd never seen anything like the scene where la Belle runs through the castle in slowmo with the magic arms holding the candelabras guiding her way and then seemingly floats down the hallway with the curtains billowing to some of the most otherworldly music I've ever heard in a movie score. The special effects are not horrible for a film of its time. I love the sets especially the house of la Belle and her family. And the costumes! I thought they were absolutely splendid and very periodaccurate assuming it was supposed to be set in the 17th centuryNow for the bad... I really don't think a film being old and foreign is any excuse for clunky dialog. It's even worse if you understand French because the Englishspeaking viewer might assume that the dialog seems odd thanks to bad translation in the subtitles. But the French dialog is just plain bad. Plus the acting drives me absolutely crazy. I hate la Bte's voice. Every time he calls her la Belle I want to scream. The guy who plays the nogood brother was mildly amusing and her bitchy sisters were interesting. I almost wished the film had focused more on them than on the utterly dull Belle et Bte. Besides all this the ending was so ridiculous! I read somewhere that Cocteau did this purposely so that the viewer would be left with a bad taste in their mouth and question the validity of socalled happilyeverafter endings. If this was his indeed his intent he succeeded. Overall I think this is a question of style vs. substance. I felt the same way about Sofia Coppolla's Marie Antoinettewhich had amazing costumes music cinematography and sets but left me feeling empty and dissatisfied. However at least that film isn't called a classic. I understand all the reasons that this film gets recognized as it is groundbreaking in many ways but I don't think it deserves to be called a masterpiece.".

I would definitely recommend this movie to other people that I know. I am going to check out other movies by this director and pass them along to other members of my movie family.

I found the Disney version far more magical and emotionally engaging. Best I can say about this one is...there were some cool visuals. But that's not enough for me. Technical achievements can only elicit a detached sort of admiration. The story must have heart and the execution must be so skillful that at first you don't even notice the techniques used to make you believe in the fairytale. I didn't believe in La Belle et La Bte or get swept away.The acting was a little too exaggerated for my liking. The dialogue was awfully clunky. For instance I'd really rather not hear The Beast come right out and tell Beauty I'm good on the inside. Y'know SHOW don't tell! Beauty then proceeds to tell him he has courage but once again I'd rather see evidence of this. What did The Beast do to give her this opinion of him? Main problem is the characters lack depth and the developing relationship between Beauty  The Beast seems really forced. Not once did I believe they were falling in love  perhaps because they never really converse and get to know each other! In the Disney version you can clearly see why Belle's feelings for The Beast change...as his behaviour changes. Whereas the Beast in this film comes across as a sleazy seducer handing Beauty a line! The transformation scene at the end is abrupt and laughable. Again I must compare it unfavourably to Disney's truly moving tearinducing finale. And I'm sorry to say that the actor playing a dual role does little to distinguish his mannerisms as the Prince Formerly Known As The Beast from that of Beauty's other suitor Avenant. Beauty's reaction at the end seems far too flippant and superficially flirtatious  I saw no depth of feeling on her part.It's pretty sad when cartoon characters are more expressive and more convincing than real live actors eh? Actually what's sad is that animated movies still don't get much respect while foreign films with fancy pedigrees get an automatic stamp of Critically Acclaimed Masterpiece!  whether they honestly deserve it or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe I'm about to say this but I preferred the animated Disney version of this story to the 1946 Jean Cocteau film. I'm no Disney fan and I would personally like to stop them from taking over the world along with Starbucks but this is one case where I just thought they instilled this fairy tale with more magic. I missed the character of Gaston in the Cocteau version and I missed also the delightful assortment of animated objects. And I think this story is particularly conducive to being set to music and I enjoyed the songs in the Disney version. However on its own terms the 1946 release is well done and considered by many to be the definitive version of the beautybeast tale. I thought the acting was bland though Belle is indeed a beauty. And there are moments of pure movie magic the candelabras that light Belle's way the fireplace that watches her father eat. And for once slow motion is used in a way that doesn't feel clich. But the relationship between Belle and the Beast isn't well developed. You don't see Belle falling in love with him over the course of the film and when she professes her love at the end it seems to come out of thin air. And was I the only one confused by the transformation at the end? It doesn't get explained well at all. Though it is kind of funny at how blase Belle is when the Beast becomes a hunk and says she'll have to get used to his new face.The film is interesting in that it acknowledges the Beast's animalistic nature. He hunts wild game he craves blood and more than once you wonder whether or not he'd rather eat Belle than court her. There's a violent eroticism underlying this film that I found surprising for the year it was released.I know Cocteau asks his audience at the film's beginning to watch the film with the eyes of a child and to give itself over to the enchantment of fairy tales and I have no problem doing that. But even so I felt like he was using fairy tale logic to explain away things that could have been explained better.Grade B".

I missed the character of Gaston in the Cocteau version and I missed also the delightful assortment of animated objects. And I think this story is particularly conducive to being set to music and I enjoyed the songs in the Disney version. However on its own terms the 1946 release is well done and considered by many to be the definitive version of the beautybeast tale. I thought the acting was bland though Belle is indeed a beauty. And there are moments of pure movie magic the candelabras that light Belle's way the fireplace that watches her father eat. And for once slow motion is used in a way that doesn't feel clich. But the relationship between Belle and the Beast isn't well developed. You don't see Belle falling in love with him over the course of the film and when she professes her love at the end it seems to come out of thin air. And was I the only one confused by the transformation at the end? It doesn't get explained well at all. Though it is kind of funny at how blase Belle is when the Beast becomes a hunk and says she'll have to get used to his new face.The film is interesting in that it acknowledges the Beast's animalistic nature. He hunts wild game he craves blood and more than once you wonder whether or not he'd rather eat Belle than court her. There's a violent eroticism underlying this film that I found surprising for the year it was released.I know Cocteau asks his audience at the film's beginning to watch the film with the eyes of a child and to give itself over to the enchantment of fairy tales and I have no problem doing that. But even so I felt like he was using fairy tale logic to explain away things that could have been explained better.Grade B";

	schema:reviewBody "I know I'm probably going to take some heat for this but I've watched this movie three times now very carefully and I still don't understand what's so wonderful about it. Though this is indeed a version of the Beauty and the Beast fairytale based on Beaumont's novel a number of silly subplots muddy things and character motivations are never explained. I can't even count how many times I rolled my eyes over the course of this movie because of the gaps in logic and character inconsistencies. If you start thinking about even one of these problems half a dozen or so will press themselves forward protesting their relation to it. If you're lucky they'll all stay trapped in your head. If you're unlucky they'll escape and start gnawing the furniture.The title credits contain an injunction to be more childlike and openminded before seeing the movie since children believe everything they're told without question not true but that's a separate point and this story is apparently set in a childcentric world. One thing I retain from my childhood is my dislike of being told what to do and how to think. Any goodwill this movie might have had from me for being financiallytechnically limited in various ways was justpfftgone after that. It's a cheat and a lie. Worse it's an order Be enchanted damn you!.So we got off on the wrong foot. That doesn't mean my relationship to this movie couldn'tconceivablyhave improved from there. The first scene is promising Ludovic Belle's feckless brother and Avenant Belle's suitor precursor to Disney's Gaston are playing shooting games outside and very narrowly miss killing one of Belle's evil stepsisters. Belle's father a merchant is halfruined and deeply in debt his son Ludovic is a wastrel who digs them even further into a hole and the two spoiled sisters care only about wealth and social standing. Belle is cast as a Cinderella figure forced to work because of her father's reduced circumstances. I prefer the traditional character's willingness to help since it is so in keeping with the storybut I digress. Avenant her feckless suitor offers to take her away from it all and grabs her why? To carry her off? when she says no. Ludovic breaks things up.Belle's father finds out that one of his ships has docked and goes to see if he can fetch the goods before they get impounded by his creditors. On his way back he gets lost and stops at a castle that seems to be uninhabited except for disembodied hands that live in the walls and furniture. For the record If I ever entered that house and was forced to stay there I would find a place in the center of the largest room where the hands couldn't reach me and stay there until I died that's how repulsed and freaked out I'd be.His initial confrontation with the Beast is so ludicrous that I actually wept with laughter. Not only does the Beast give him fifteen minutes to prepare for death! not only does the Beast look ludicrous not just for 1946 I don't care if Marais spent 5 hours in makeup a day and not only does the Beast have the voice of a woman who's smoked for 30 yearsto top it off he's trussed up fancier than the vainest royal personage you'll ever see. What happened to the Beast part of this story? We don't find out until later that the Beast became the Beast because his parents didn't believe in fairiesmagicwhich is incidentally the dumbest reason for becoming a Beast in any version of the legendit's even worse than the original story's reason. In it a fairy turned him into a hideous beast after he refused to let her in from the rain.Later on he also apologizes for being a Beast. Why? Even if he's lying and he actually became a Beast because he broke into the Temple of Dianawhy? For eating a deer? He's a Beast. We shouldn't apologize for whowhat we are. If you aren't satisfied with yourself don't ply me or Belle as the case is with explanations and excuses and pleas for forgiveness. Change yourself like the rest of us do and stop griping.Another strange thing is that even though Belle repulsed Avenant at the beginningand even though he physically abused hershe still tells the BeastturnedPrince that she was in love with him. What? scratches head Acting is cartoonish and uninspired as is the script. There is excessive politeness everywhere not translated in the subtitles but my French suffices to pick it up even between the father and the usurer! I don't know if it's a French thing to be totally polite constantly to all one's countrymen but I really rather doubt it. Dialogue in general is simple at best and clichd at worst. I realize that we weren't very far from the age of silent movies in 1946 but geez1952's Pysna Princezna was acted and written worlds better than this and Pysna is another fairymovie with some subversive themes even though it was aimed at children.People praise the visual style of La Belle et la Bete and forget that the movie makes no sense. What's wrong with people? Or with me? I wanted to like andor understand this movie but I don't think I ever will though I've read scads of rave reviews. I don't mean to be harsh or hatespewing for the sake of it but when I sought out helpful negative reviews of this movie to compare with the hundreds of positive ones there were very few to be found. So my purpose is twofold to write that negative review and to hopefully find out what I'm missing.Slick cinematography Alekan would go on to do one of my favorite movies Der Himmel ber Berlin and a haunting score by Georges Auric can't save this travesty of storytelling.".

Cocteau stays quite close to the original story.Cocteau didn't have a prolific career as a filmmaker. His previous movie had been the 1930 avantgarde short movie The Blood of a Poet. His lack of practice at making movies only makes the accomplishments of Beauty and the Beast more impressive  he shows such a natural talent for cinema such a command of its language and understanding of its visual possibilities that no one would ever imagine this was his first featurelength movie.The movie's best asset is Cocteau's imagination. In the magical world he creates for this movie he juxtaposes the ordinary with the wondrous  so household objects have voices and talk to Belle armshaped candelabra emerge from the walls to illuminate a passerby and statues a special mention must go to the makeup in this movie move their eyes about silently. Cocteau moved within the surrealist circles and knew many of artists and their influence on him can be seen here clearly.Two other members of the crew contribute to make this movie unforgettable first of all Henri Alekan the cinematographer perhaps better known for his work in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire who emulates the style of two classic painters  Jan Vermeer and Gustave Dor  to better portray the contrast between the beautiful outside world and the eerie mysterious interior of the Beast's castle.And to accompany the beautiful visuals Georges Auric composed a melancholy tragic score that suits the tortured love relationship between Belle and the Beast and enhances the movie's dreamy atmosphere.Josette Day plays Belle with the humility and compassion that defines her simple altruistic existence and she would certainly have given the best performance in the movie were it not for Jean Marais. A favourite of Cocteau he plays two roles in the movie the Beast and Avenant a scoundrel in love with Belle. He's excellent in both roles ironically playing a despicable greedy human and a tragic kindhearted monster. Although he makes Avenant effortlessly unlikeable it's amazing how much depth he brings to the Beast. With the help of a makeup suit ahead of its time he just disappears in the role and becomes a creature torn between bestial instincts and a struggle to retain humanity.Half dream half fantasy a complete love story from start to finish Beauty and the Beast will just leave any viewer enchanted with Cocteau's vision of a world where love unapologetically triumphs over everything just like in our childhood's fairytales.".

Jean Cocteau director was despite his hesitancy to claim so one of the early surrealists and his cinematic style lends perfection to the world of fairy tales. This is a very carefully crafted movie and it feels similar to American studio classics from the 1940's e.g. clean BW photography attractive cast high budget etc.. However Cocteau was very much an artist and he took risks with his projects. The result is fairly unique and Cocteau's style would later be characterized perhaps paradoxically as classical avantgard. The story is one we've all heard but Cocteau brings a terrific flair that makes the film consistently interesting. Similarly the characters are each also interesting and the performances are great. At the hands of lesser talent this project could have been laughable. Cocteau and the cast took big risks and the payoff was a timeless classic. This is a beautiful rendition of a beautiful story.

	schema:headline " Subversive Beauty toys with our expectations";
	schema:reviewBody "Beauty and the Beast is a fascinating adaptation of the Leprince de Beaumont fairy tale that tweaks the story's usual theme of love beyond appearance. In director Jean Cocteau's sumptuous fantasy the Beast's appearance remains a constant hindrance to love throughout the story and Belle has difficulty looking beyond it. Disney's version the most familiar to this viewer finds Belle learning to love the beast for his character and eventually growing to love his unique but not too beastly appearance. Cocteau has something else in mind and uses the fairy tale to examine traditional notions of beauty and love. Belle is not quite the heroine we expected and the Beast is not rewarded in the manner we assume.Cocteau explains his intentions in this letter to American viewers To fairyland as people usually see it I would bring a kind of realism to banish the vague and misty nonsense now so completely outworn. My story would concern itself mainly with the unconscious obstinacy with which women pursue the same type of man and expose the naivet of the old fairy tales that would have us believe that this type reaches its ideal in conventional good looks. My aim would be to make the Beast so human so sympathetic so superior to men that his transformation into Prince Charming would come as a terrible blow to Beauty condemning her to a humdrum marriage and a future that I summed up in that last sentence of all fairy tales And they had many children. I was therefore obliged to deceive both the public and Beauty herself. Slyly and with much effort I persuaded my cameraman Alekan to shoot Jean Marais as the Prince in as saccharine a style as possible. The trick worked. When the picture was released letters poured in from matrons teenage girls and children complaining to me and Marais about the transformation. They mourned the disappearance of the Beastthe same Beast who terrified them so at the time when Madame Leprince de Beaumont wrote the tale. So in Beauty and the Beast Cocteau is trying to be subversive and unpack traditional notions of beauty. Belle more inwardly and outwardly beautiful than her wicked sisterssee Goneril and Reganstill is none too saintly as to rise above an enslavement to the desire for the traditional prize catch. Given that fairy tales are about the attractive ensnaring the attractivebeauty is the result of good character and vice versaCocteau's conclusion is likely to appear odd and unsatisfying after the first viewing. When Belle gets her handsome prince we are ill at ease and unsatisfied. I found it offputting but after reading Cocteau's letter reprinted in part above I am fascinated. He was being a provocateur trying to destabilize the ideological underpinnings of the fairy tale and necessarily our own facile desires. The seeming purity of fairy tales is a sham and props up a superficial beauty ethic.Yet Beauty succeeds as a traditional fairy tale until its closing moments. Belle is far kinder than her sisters and chooses to put herself at the mercy of the Beast when her sisters refuse out of vain self interest. She is pursued by a strapping traditional hero type unworthy of her attention and greedy. Her quest finds her remaining in the beast's home but more out of a desire to honor her father and out of respect and admiration but not love of the Beast. That this love never really materializes is confounding given our familiarity with the story. Cocteau is playing a devilish game.When ever anyone enters the Beast's estate the straightforward sunny film becomes dark and dreamlike. Time slows down and characters float across the screen. Candelabras are represented by human arms poking through walls clutching candlesticks. An obvious inspiration to Lumiere Ms. Potts and crew. The Beast costume is convincing and surprising given my expectation of 1946 special effects. The film whether the viewer appreciates its rhetorical aims is too beautiful to miss.And what do we make of the ending? Belle finally gets her handsome prince but not as we expected. When the Beast changes it does not feel triumphant but tragic. The Beast proves to be the film's most noble character and Belle a tragic figure for seeking out someone more palatable. Cocteau closes his film with a triumphant ascension to the heavens but we feel loss and disappointment.Is Cocteau successful in deconstructing our beauty ethic? It's hard to say yes when he's so clearly manipulating the audience but it is a deft manipulation and done in a medium that honors beauty as a virtue. In the end it's a beautiful experiment that needs to be experienced and unpacked. Don't miss it.".

The Net 2.0 was released on DVD on Tuesday I watched it on Wednesday and there is only one other comment on IMDb as I write this. I suppose it is safe to say that this production went directly to video and skipped the movie houses. Also it did not spark a lot of interest in the constituency of IMDb. I know why.Irwin Winkler is the producer of this movie and his son Charles Winkler is the director. Papa Winkler has produced such movies as They Shoot Horses Don't They the Rocky movies The Net The Juror Goodfellas and DeLovely. He was the director of the original The Net. Charles on the other hand has directed several TV movies a Baywatch Episode and a few movies that I have never heard of. This is a major example as to why nepotism can be costly.As far as I can tell the Winkler connection is the only connection of The Net to its purported sequel. There is no comparing them. Indeed a woman looses her identity in both movies but storyline and execution make them two entirely different items.The story is not real credible and the way it unfolds is herkyjerky there are many points at which the viewer is invited to yawn. The story could have worked if it was done differently. This was shot in Turkey and had many Turkish actors. I thought they actually added more spice than the American cast. Sebnem Dnmez the Interpol agent and Gven Kirac who played Osman were fresh faces and were enjoyable.I really think this could have been improved with a better presentation I would recommend that you watch this on a very slow day when you have nothing else to do.".

I even registered at IMDb just for the purpose of expressing my disgust at this film. Although I do have to say I'm particularly amused at the comments above praising the film. It's almost like the director andor the actors have logged in to talk up this piece of tripe.Intro  My name is Hope. I'm an orphan. I like telling jokes about my name and its literal meaning. Did I mention my name is Hope? It is. Hope. I hope you know that my name is Hope.Cut to the first of many ridiculous takes on computer security as we see Hope and her douche boyfriend having an argument after she rids his MS laptop of a virus by typing random messages overheard in a bar near a programming office into a GUI while the virus gives her a countdown of how long it will take before his laptop is infected or blows up I couldn't tell.The break down of this is that she's going to Turkey to work as a computer security expert for some people she's never heard of. After losing all of her money on her flight to Turkey via her tablet pc that conveniently counted down her funds before stripping her bare she arrives with the wrong type of visa then gets paranoid at the drop of a hat and proceeds to tell her story to the first American woman she sees a woman who consequently steals her identity using Hope's aforementioned story.Cue her going to a job with a Supercomputer that is completely graphically driven and shows every transaction happening at a major bank in realtime as popups complete with location and amount. I won't even touch on the laser security grid.Then watch as she gets in a car chase which she concludes by dropping an LPG tank that was rattling around in the back of her stolen truck in front a Mercedes that promptly blows up on impact with said tank. The writing for this scene goes like this  I hope this works. Pulls lever in cab. Tank drops in front of Merc. Tank blows up. Hope pumps her fist and says Yes! Weak.In the end it was all a con job by the Russian Mafia and her douche boyfriend to get her to steal money for them which she ends up with at the end after faking her own death in an anticlimactic scene involving the douche and his coconspirator the psychologist.So basically if it wasn't for the acting the direction the script and the production values this might have made a good ad for MSoft products and Istanbul.Give it a miss or have a laugh at this tragic trainwreck of a movie.One star but only because I can't rate it any lower.".

Never mind the fact that Santa Sofia was a central part of the scenery plus the occasional shot of Cemil Attaturk!  as it should be stated much like how you find pictures of Al Pacino Scarface! in certain parts of Miami but probably what most folks don't get completely is the psychological impact of the old Byzantine walls they add a sense of foreboding threat and the sense that you're surrounded. My one locational disappointment was the restaurant scene in Santa Monica. I'm sorry I lived in LA for 8 months working dawn 'til dusk on a contract job and spent my free time what there was in either Old Town Pasadena or Santa Monica  nothing I saw looked like that restaurant. My one other criticism is Hope's cellphonePC gizmo lucky for her it didn't need to get charged whereas my gizmos always need to get rejuiced daily.Anyways a couple things are going against the film are a female protagonist a foreign set with foreign crew etc and that it's a derivative film of The Net. Notwithstanding all that I think it's a great film. It's not a chick flick though it could have elements of that. It is exciting it is engrossing I wasn't bored and I would recommend it because it's different and I was challenged to keep up. The director and script draw you deeper into the mystery over time and you just ride the wild tiger.I also felt that this film should be viewed with Empire of Wolves for a westerner's view of modernday Turkey. The story is timely ID theft is an international business. The setting is also timely  relevant because Turkey is on the cusp if you consider an estimated 10 years of duration to be a cusp of achieving EU membership.".

On one bad point though i would have to say they shouldn't have started the film in the future so the film is backtracked and the skipping camera makes it difficult to see what is actually happening.

The Net 2.0 is the first movie in HISTORY to be completely funded by product placement Specifically that DAMN PDA phone which gets as much time on screen as the leading women!. The movie and I use the word movie lightly plays dramatic music and freezes in on the PDA just about every time she uses it such as when she's in the BATHROOM!. As you can probably guess this really enhances the riveting story that is centered on 1 main character and how her identity is stolen.The movie opens with a bang as our main leading lady runs through the streets of Istanbul and is chased by the SLOWEST police force on the planet. While she is running she takes pauses and freezes the movie to tell us about her life. First she explains her name is Hope Cassidyis and that her parents died in a plane crash. Then something about her sisters who were never born or something Then the movie unfreezes and she starts running again. This scene is about all the back story we get from this movie. That and her constantly telling everyone she meets that shes a computer programmer who's really good and that Turkish people want her. Its all really poorly acted. Anyways back to the endless chase scene. This Opening Scene IS ALL THE ACTION that's in the movie. If you think is going to get better it isn't! If you think that Helicopter on the DVD screen is going to chase Hope then your wrong! You just get to see a Shot of it flying at the end and it lasts 3 seconds and there is NO REASON FOR IT!!!!!!!!! JUST SO THE COULD PUT IT ON THE COVER AND MAKE YOU THINK SHES GOING TO BE CHASED BY A CHOPPER! Its in some Parallel Universe perhaps in a good movie.to be fair there is some action spliced through the movie so its not completely unbearable. Also it taught me that everyone and i mean EVERYONE in Turkey speaks fluent English. The rest of the movie is made up of really bad scenes and REALLY AWFUL acting. One of the sets is a Commercial Jet who's interior has 6 count them 6 seats! Then In one scene when Hope goes to her Job that is Secretly run by the Russian MafiaJesus this is stupid so she enters the main computer terminal that's guarder by a laser mesh thing. Think Resident Evil but REALLY low Budget. She enters the room then sits down and another shot later A WOOD DOOR APPEARS OUT OF NO WHERE! where the lasers use to be. Guess they didn't have the budget for the lasers! They spent a good 20 seconds telling us about the Lasers but hey guess when we have our actress brake into the room will put A DOOR there!And then there's the scene where are leading Lady changes her suit mid scene. This is only about 13 the way in So it gets So much worse trust me don't rent this! Lastly there is a scene in which a cop shoots a car 3 times and it BLOWS up!! Guess its not a good idea to fill your car with propane tanks and Hydrogen...".

I admit that the Turkish settings occasionally give the movie a fairly colourful backdrop but all the same more often than not the movie has a really cheap feeling. The movie possibly could have succeeded despite that shortcoming but the direction and the script work together to sink the entire enterprise. The movie feels sluggish and slow  it takes forever for the movie to really get going and even when it does there is no bite to any scene. No tension or excitement even during the poorly directed action sequences. But even worse than the weak direction is the screenplay. Even if you are not an expert on computers and the Internet there are many scenes with technology that are so obviously improbable that you'll groan out loud. The heroine also commits a lot of nontechnological actions that are just as stupid. In the end the only real interest the movie has apart from its colorful backdrop is bringing up the question as to why it managed to get an R rating from the MPAA the content of the movie deserves a PG13 at most.".

	schema:reviewBody "THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE KWAI the story of British POW's forced to build the Japanese jungle railroad was my favorite book when it came out in 1962. Thus I was a bit apprehensive at what filmmakers would do to it when I heard about TO END ALL WARS the title itself being changed. The film is different in many ways from the book but is so powerful that the addition apparently for dramatic excitement of fictional characters bent on staging an escape can be forgiven. Agnostic Ernest Gordon's story of his being nursed back from the brink of death by Christian friends thereby starting him on the road to faithand incredibly understanding and then forgiveness of the harsh brutality of his Japanese captorsraises this film far above any other WW2 films that I have seen except perhaps the underrated THE THIN RED LINE like TO END...also filled with philosophical questions and ruminations. Although the brutality of the Japanese bushito system is shown in all its horrific brutality some of the Japanese especially the young man who serves as interpreter are depicted as having touch of humanity. The film's central thesis seems to depict the affects of clinging to anger and vengeance versus seeking to be able to forgive and reconcile. The latter is shown at the end of the film when similar to the scene in SCHINDLER'S LIST the real Capt. Ernest Gordon and Japanese interpreter Nagase now old men meet and shake hands in Thailand at a memorial to those who died building the railroad. The creativity of the men forming a Jungle University where Plato and Shakespeare are taught is celebrated calling to mind the inspiring film of women POW's PARADISE ROAD. When this thoughtinspiring film finally is released to theaters or video don't miss it. It can serve as an antidote to the dozens of mindless vengeancebased flicks cluttering up the screens of our cinemaplexes.".

Thus I was a bit apprehensive at what filmmakers would do to it when I heard about TO END ALL WARS the title itself being changed. The film is different in many ways from the book but is so powerful that the addition apparently for dramatic excitement of fictional characters bent on staging an escape can be forgiven. Agnostic Ernest Gordon's story of his being nursed back from the brink of death by Christian friends thereby starting him on the road to faithand incredibly understanding and then forgiveness of the harsh brutality of his Japanese captorsraises this film far above any other WW2 films that I have seen except perhaps the underrated THE THIN RED LINE like TO END...also filled with philosophical questions and ruminations. Although the brutality of the Japanese bushito system is shown in all its horrific brutality some of the Japanese especially the young man who serves as interpreter are depicted as having touch of humanity. The film's central thesis seems to depict the affects of clinging to anger and vengeance versus seeking to be able to forgive and reconcile. The latter is shown at the end of the film when similar to the scene in SCHINDLER'S LIST the real Capt. Ernest Gordon and Japanese interpreter Nagase now old men meet and shake hands in Thailand at a memorial to those who died building the railroad. The creativity of the men forming a Jungle University where Plato and Shakespeare are taught is celebrated calling to mind the inspiring film of women POW's PARADISE ROAD. When this thoughtinspiring film finally is released to theaters or video don't miss it. It can serve as an antidote to the dozens of mindless vengeancebased flicks cluttering up the screens of our cinemaplexes.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am a serious film lover who keeps up with the best new films. I stumbled across To End All Wars when it was shown recently on one of the StarzEncore channels. At the end I kept asking myself why I had never heard of it. The film is nowhere to be found in Roger Ebert's reviews or Leonard Maltin's annual guide and yet I suspect that Ebert at least would rate this film very highly.I like films that are about something that is important at least to me and not just pure entertainment. Not that I don't enjoy a good actionadventure film or light comedy from time to time but most of the time I prefer to spend my time watching films that make me think and perhaps even ask questions of myself.To End All Wars is one such film. The Bridge on the River Kwai which deals with the same historical events is not despite its many strong points. In this respect To End All Wars is the better film and the one that I am more likely to watch frequently.Despite its title the film is not really about war. What it is about is the efforts of a small group of men and one man in particular to maintain their faith their sense of values and their very sanity under horrible murderous conditions that would drive most men to insanity or to become murderers themselves.The film forces me to ask myself whether I could have done the same under those conditions. To be honest I'm afraid to ask the question because I may not like the answer.Although the film depicts many horrible things it is not a depressing film at least for me. Rather it's a positive hopeful film in the same way that Schindler's List is a positive hopeful film. If one man in the case of Schindler or a small group of men in the case of the ones in this film can maintain their sanity faith and values in a world that has gone insane then there is hope for mankind.As for the references to their Christian faith it is not laid on with a trowel as it might be in a lesser film. It is simply there as an important part of their lives. Whether or not we share that faith is beside the point. What is important is that they shared it and that faith helped them to survive.Could the director and the writers have made their points even more effectively? Probably. Would I have liked to have known more about the individual characters? Definitely. Would the film have benefited from a larger budget? Possibly.All of these questions are moot however. Every film deserves to be judged on its own terms on the basis of what it is and not what it might have been. Not every film can be another Citizen Kane or Rules of the Game nor should it be.Taken on its own merits To End All Wars is an excellent film that I expect to watch many times and recommend to my family and friends as well. The fact that the film never got proper distribution at least in the United States and therefore never got the recognition that it deserves shows just how shallow and superficial the Hollywood film industry has become. Thankfully it is available on DVD.".

So the movie is constantly trying to pull on my emotions without earning it. That's sentimentalism. When the swelling Celtic or Triumph of the Human Spirit music came and it came often it was a farce! A joke! KILL 'EM ALL CAUSE I DON'T CARE!2 It lacks any subtlety whatever. First the omnipresent use of the Narrator is a dead giveaway. Narrators in moving pictures are ALWAYS questionable and usually show laziness or ineptitude or that they're dumbing things down. Using the Narrator throughout as this turkey does it becomes a short story acted out on the screen. It's sermonic. It defeats the purpose of MOVING PICTURES. Aren't movies moving pictures  music  dialogue being ACTED OUT to make us feel and think? TELLING us how to feel and think through narration or obvious dialogue betrays the intent of a movie. Secondly the dialogue was unsubtle. A man saves his rations to give to a dying man. He tells the dying man that he has connections to get extra. Then the nice man is dying and the other wonders about it. An onlooker says He never got extra rations. STOP OH PLEASE STOP. No he goes and spells it outHe was giving you his. Here's anotherNarrator We didn't pay the captain back in kind it began to eat at him. Show it subtly don't just blurt it out loud! Here was a priceless one Hardboiled hardtalking Scotsman Whatever Dusty said to Ito I knew that I had witnessed the power of forgiveness. I knew that I had witnessed the power of forgiveness?! Whoop! Thirdly the symbolism was o so unsubtle and way overdone. The onemanpunishedforalltheunworthyones came up 3 or 4 times. One guy gets nailed Jesusstyle to a literal cross! To me this cheapens Jesus's cross. If you're going to use that symbol show it in the distance something! And the ending scene ends up mocking the much better Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. The movie had other serious problems. It didn't know what it wanted to be. By turns it's an escape movie a life is meaningless movie a knowledge makes life worth living movieit tries to be too much. There's also too many emotional arcs. They're happy they're sad they're up they're down they're winning no they're losing... And the theology is bad. Love your enemy and turn the other cheek apply to personal injury not to wartime unless you're one of those who believes all war is wrong. Finally there was NO humor in the movie. In the worst of times maybe especially in the worst of times there is humor.My tag lines Christian moviemaking at its best! Torture yourself by watching 'To End All Wars.'".

	schema:reviewBody "Theres no such thing as a Scot who isnt a fan of Robert Carlyle so Im one of nearly five million people who has followed his career with some interest and vaguely remembered in 2001 he was starring in a POW drama called TO END ALL WARS but didnt hear much else about the movie and after seeing it on TV a couple of nights ago I can certainly understand why it disappeared without trace . It is a very disappointing film First of all I confess that movies set in Japanese POW camps deserve to be seen by everybody  unlike post war German society Japan never ever refers to the atrocities committed by their side during the second world war . Japanese history books are devoid of entries involving the invasion of Manchuria  the rape of NangKing  the Bataan death march  Korean  Comfort women  and the Burma railway . Of course Japanese text books do mention the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki but that seems to be the only referrences to the second world war which is a bit like present day Germany claiming the war started with the bombing of Dresden and finished with the Red Army invading Berlin and raping the local women . So any movie that portrays the Imperial Japanese Army in a bad light is okay in my opinion  But the problem with TO END ALL WARS is two fold . First is the totally unfocussed characters . When the film was completed much was made that it  Starred  Robert Carlyle and Kiefer Sutherland but after seeing the movie its obvious that neither Carlyles character Campbell or Sutherlands character Reardon is the main character  Its Ciaran McMenamins Ernest Gordon the original author of the book and seeing both Carlyle and Sutherland are far better known faces than McMenamin the three characters compete for screen time in a rather uneven manner . Perhaps it would have been better if a fairly big name had been cast as Gordon with Campbell and Reardon being played by unknowns ? Especially since much of the tale is carried by Gordons narration . Secondly as several people have already pointed out much of the story feels like cliche . Its probably not the fault of this production but why does every Japanese POW camp have to feature a loud brash American running a scam ? Both BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI and KING RAT feature similar characters . Theres a few other cliches along the way too As I said this is a disappointing movie and due to the subject matter a rather depressing one too".

	schema:reviewBody "The material with which Cunningham et al were working with in this film was tremendous unfortunately their handling of it was not. Part Bridge on the River Kwai part The Great Escape part The Passion of the Christ heavily sanitized the film probably suffered from trying to live up to the mastery of its predecessors.To begin with some positives though the photography is very good. Although some of the shots do a poor job of creating a sense of visual rhythm each frame can stand alone as a still photograph. The shots are nicely balanced and the lighting is rarely amiss. The acting also leaves little to be desired. This is one area in which Cunningham succeeding as a director he really did a nice job of fostering an actorfriendly atmosphere and brought out the best in the respective players.However as successful as Cunningham was in directing the shooting and acting he was equally unsuccessful with the rest of the filmmaking process. To begin with there is a comic litany of unlikely objects magically appearing in this remote Japanese prison camp. From a set of bagpipes to a collection of clean dress uniforms to a violin to a wheelchair that would have made FDR envious some of the decisions that were apparently made to enhance the dramatic effects of certain scenes stretched the imagination more than a little bit. It was also remarkable how wellshaven the POW's remained during their twoandahalf year imprisonment.But those are relatively minor issues I suppose. More damning is the general lack of perspective that the film provides both narratively and spatially. For example there is no feeling as to how long the march from the battlefield to the camp was although I assume that it was supposed to be a long arduous ordeal. Cunningham's issues providing narrative perspective were perhaps the most important flaw in the film. As a viewer I was never able to grasp the difficulties that these men had in this camp. While the narrator I believe the presence of the narrator to have been a mistake to begin with for this particular film kept making references to the precariousness of their hold on life and sanity the film never visually or narratively reinforced the grindingdown provided by the everyday reality of the camp. There are a handful of exceptional instances of oppression shown but nothing that leaves you feeling the physical and mental exhaustion the prisoners faced every day. Instead you see a lot of scenes of the prisoners as they perform Shakespeare or discuss philosophy. On an intellectual rational level it is apparent how important these activities could have been to the prisoners but this importance is never captured aesthetically.There is also precious little character development. Firstly too many characters are important for all of them to be sufficiently developed in a featurelength film. There are too many stories to tell without enough time to tell them all. The characters ultimately remain relatively static in spite of the wonderful potential supplied by the plot to turn any one of these men into a compelling portrait. This lack of character development also saps the strength of many of the philosophicalreligious overtones. Because it is difficult to connect to many of the characters their sacrifices and transgressions mean much less than they should.Finally as I hinted at before the presence of the narrator eventually undermined any subtlety that the film may have had. While is some places the narrator's comments merely cheapened the showing as opposed to telling of important thematic elements in the film in many places the narrator's comments completely replaced any attempt to show the reality on which he was commenting upon including his comments on the hardships of the imprisonment.While I have heardread many people who have responded very emotionally to this film in a positive way I have a hard time understanding their sentiment. The film simply relies too heavily on abstraction rather than visualnarrative demonstration of the reality it is trying to depict to inspire any strong emotions in me. While the plot and characters contain a true treasure trove of potential I feel like most of the potential was wasted on this particular filmmaking team.".

As the film began it felt like a cousin to Bridge on the River Kwai but the plot slowly morphed to an even MORE complex set of ethical issues with divisions not seen in that great 1950's film. I see this new one as more related to the movie Andersonville  our own true American tragedy of a P.O.W. camp during the Civil War  and what THAT experience demanded of those interned. To End all Wars is certainly an antiwar film and a true story but looks at many individuals for the complexity of dealing with the horror...and offers bits of consolation...where it can be found. Its elegant ending reminded me of Schindler's List. To End all Wars deserves to be considered a PROFOUND film.".

I was surprised and incensed to look further into the story.From the perspective of a movie the actors directing etc were all very well put together and played. Kieffer Sutherland brought his character to pulling you into his part Mark Strong and Ciaran McMenamin played their parts as kindred spirits excellently.The best acting was Sakae Kimura playing Sgt. Ito. He never spoke a line of English through the film but his facial expressions spoke massive volumes! I was completely taken aback with how well he communicated without even speaking my native tongue. My hat is off to him for such an excellent performance.If you enjoy films about humanity perseverance against all odds and learning the atrocities of war this will be well worth your time!".

When I heard of To End All Wars it sounded promising and decided to give it a try. It never came to a theater near me but I did get to rent it when it came out on DVD. I have to say that touched me beyond any movie I have never seen and you can't even imagine how many movies I have seen. The directing was beyond glorious that I'm sure Steven Spielberg would be moved. I very much liked how he portrayed the POW's and the Japanese soldiers. The POW's are very shaky handheld look while on the opposite side the Japanese are very still and clear cut. The story was powerful and something everyone can learn from. The Christian subtext is light and only adds to the characters. The acting was fantastic! Robert Carlyle and Kiefer Sutherland gave amazing performances but I do think that they were upstaged by Ciaran McMenamin and Mark Strong. They convicted me and touched my soul as they brought out only what I can call true life. If you want to watch something that will make a true impact on you and leave you breathless then this is the movie to go with. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.".

Well believe me TO END ALL WARS is this film! It's a very good WAR film where shots and guns are not seen very much. Maybe this movie should be named a drama war or anything like a military drama. But let alone the genre. The important thing is to enjoy this nice movie with a different development a Scottish group of soldiers are sent to Thailand to fight the Japanese force but ends up being kept as captive. The soldiers are forced to build a railway for the Japanese but some of them plan to escape from that hell. When they're together at night they discuss what to do for their future but they don't seem to agree about it. The discussions and arguments arise and each of the prisoners defends his point of view. The acting is very good and our attention is 100 towards the story.".

This film can teach us a thing or two about being human.I highly recommend this beautiful film but beware it's not for the faint hearted.Actually it touched me deep inside and made me think what is life and why can't we live in peace without these agonizing wars!".
