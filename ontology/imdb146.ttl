	schema:headline " Yes Cushing and Lee ARE in It!";
	schema:reviewBody "Followup to Salt and Pepper where Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis Jr. played two very middleaged swingers running a night spot called Salt and Pepper. This time around the two get into trouble for repeated problems and ask Lawford's lookalike brotheryes he plays him as well for money. Turns out he is a Lord and owns the family castle given up by Pepper so long ago. Also turns out he is involved in smuggling diamonds and is a double agent etc... Lawford's brother is killed and Lawford as Pepper assumes his brother's role and hilarity is to ensue  NOT! While I believe this to be a more engaging and slightly more amusing vehicle than the original Salt and Pepper it really doesn't have a lot going for it. Jerry Lewis directs his buddies Davis and Lawford and with his special brand of humour. We get Davis trying to be Jerry Lewis in several scenes a scene with him seeing how everything is huge in his new bedroom at the castle where he looks and everything looks so huge. I have seen Lewis pull this same thing countless times. Davis not sure if this is a compliment or not is no Lewis however. He just doesn't have the same lunatic spirit though he has some scenes which are slightly amusing. Most of the time he does come off as being very flat because the material is so tiresome and overused. The brightest spots in the movie are Lawford's as he pulls off playing the two brothers really rather well. The plot is ridiculous. Are we really to believe that these two overthehill guys are hip swingers? Davis of course sings a few tunes including the somewhat catchy One More Time as the opening and end credits roll. For me the only fascinating aspect of the film is the addition of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in brief  and I mean BRIEF  cameos. In one scene Davis finds a wooden secret panel in the castle that has behind it  down some steps a laboratory with Cushing standing a woman on a gurney and Lee bearing fangs. Cushing has a brief line or so as does Lee. Their screen time is embarrassingly slight. Why Lewis didn't given them a bit more time amazes me as THIS scene is the opening scene in this film's theatrical trailer! Unfortunately Cushing and Lee maybe have 30 seconds of screen time. But if you are a completist in either's filmography you will have to endure One More Time at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even if you don't like the earlier film Salt and Pepper you have to admit that it is a paragon of structure and traditional storytelling compared its sequel One More Time. That's not to say that the second Davis JrLawford team up isn't enjoyableit is just bizarrely different from the original. Salt and Pepper directed by Richard Donnerveteran director of some of the Sixties' best TV series and later of the classic actioncomedies in the Lethal Weapon and Superman series of filmswas a light and breezy Rat Pack actioncomedy. It was wholly conventional for its time. But when it came time for the sequel the producers apparently decided that the success of the first film was due more to the comedy elements than the thriller elements. With that in mind they made the obvious choice for their new directorJerry Lewis. The singular Lewis had never directed a film starring anyone else but himself so I'm not sure what the producers expected would happen. Well the result was that Jerry didn't just add a few comic touches to the already proved formula. He took the thing over entirely and made One More Time a pure 100 Jerry Lewis film with all that means for good and bad. If you're familiar with Lewis' filmmaking you know that his films are very light on plot ranging from hardly any as in Cinderfella to none at all as in The Bellboy and Hardly Working. and very heavy on surreal jokes visual gags and his own patented mugging and clowning. Well the plot of One More Time is this Lawford impersonates his rich brother who is mysteriously murdered and Davis Jr. doesn't figure it out until near the end. That's about it. The film is 90 minutes long and at least an hour of that is just Sammy Davis Jr. doing a spot on Lewis imitation in a series of increasingly strange and barely connected but often funny vignettes as he rambles about in Lawford's illgotten English manor. If you go into this film expecting anything different as the audiences in 1970 did then you're going to be sorely disappointed as the audiences in 1970 were. But if you go in expecting a Jerry Lewis filmyou get a pretty good one!".

It's not as weird as it seems back then stars were stars even if they were middleaged. These days if you're over thirty you can't be a lead but in the good old days of freewheeling moviemaking you could be in your fifties and a heart throb. And this movie is pretty freewheeling as it was directed by the totally unprofessional Jerry Lewis Dean Martin's sidekick and most famous these days for telethons and running around yelling Laydee! Laydee! Jerry Lewis was a megalomaniac of the worst kind one with no discernible talent. He does a lousy job which was a shame since Sammy Davis Jr. had enormous talent. He could sing dance act and do voices. He was one of the most talented individuals in the public eye in the twentieth century and it shows through. But mostly Lewis lets Davis run around with as little discipline as himself.Everything looks like it might have been put together by amateurs for a college course. The plot is silly but lots of them were back then. It was a kind of deconstruction of movies in the late 60s. Watch Tony Curtis movies like Arrivederci Baby! or Dean Martin's Matt Helm flicks which may have drawn Lewis to this project as he always liked to play catch up with Martin. Silly was in but this flick was hardly as well done as later with the AbrahamsZucker or the Farrelly Bros.Apart from keeping Lawford and and Davis in the public eye and keeping them cool I can't think of a reason for making this movie at all. The plot is silly the acting is on par with people who know they're doing a picture of little value and Lewis made a hash of the direction. It's one of the movies you watch through just so you'll never have to see it again.Highlights 1 Mixup of the opening credits you know you're in trouble if that's the best part 2 a couple of good cameos in unexpected places okay if you're in imdb you can see Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are in it and though they're only there for a few seconds they lift the movie momentarily.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always had a soft spot for 1968's 'Salt  Pepper' in which Sammy Davis Junior and Peter Lawford played 'Charles Salt' and 'Christopher Pepper' trendy London nightclub owners caught up in an espionage plot.Two years later the dynamic duo were back only this time the results were nowhere near as successful.The Salt and Pepper club has been closed down by the police and they have to pay 500 each or face prison. Pepper asks his snooty rich twin brother Lord Sydney  also Lawford  for the money. The lord agrees provided that both men leave the country for good. After a heated row Pepper decides to get his own back by impersonating his twin in order to secure a free meal in a posh restaurant. Returning to Lord Sydney's apartment however he finds him dead shot by an African blowpipe. The sneaky Pepper decides to go on play acting and make the world think that Christopher Pepper is now dead. The killers are still out there however and want back the diamonds Lord Sydney stole from them...So we have moved away from the world of espionage and into the realm of crime making the film an altogether different affair lacking the wild action sequences of the first. Replacing Richard Donner in the director's chair is none other than Jerry Lewis. We get an idea of what a Lewis and Martin film might have looked like had one been made in the late '60's. Davis Junior in particular behaves like Jerry especially in the scene where he prowls around Pepperworth Castle to the accompaniment of the theme to '2001 A Space Odyssey' released two years earlier. Another funny moment is when Tombs  Sydney Arnold  the elderly butler lumbers into Pepper's dining room. By the time he reaches them with the food Salt and Pepper have acquired five o'clock shadow.Like a lot of Lewis' movies there is an unfortunate tendency towards sentimentality and selfindulgence. Salt's grieving for his friend brings the comedy to a screeching halt and his impersonation of 'The Chocolate Dandy' should have been left on the cutting room floor.Michael Bates' incompetent 'Inspector Crabbe' was supposed to reappear  he is in Michael Avallone's novelisation . Instead we get Leslie Sands as 'Inspector Glock' who's nowhere near as amusing. The book also suggests that the movie was written originally for a much bigger budget there is a funny scene where Salt and Pepper wreak havoc in an aeroplane. It is not in the finished film.As was the case with 'Salt  Pepper' the British supporting cast are first rate in particular Allan Cuthbertson Dudley Sutton Anthony Nicholls Moultrie Kelsall Peter Reeves Bill Maynard  as a Bondian villain with a shaved head  and Glyn Owen. The music was by Les Reed cocomposer of many Tom Jones hits. Check out Pepper's groovy lounge you need sunglasses just to admire the decor.Things To Look Out For a cameo by Christopher Lee as 'Count Dracula' and Peter Cushing as 'Baron Frankenstein'! Not up to the first film then but some good moments on display and overall a lot better than many of the Lewis vehicles of that period.".

This here is a sequel to SALT AND PEPPER which apparently made enough money at the box office where the producers thought a sequel would be a good idea. For some reason Jerry Lewis was brought on to direct the picture. I viewed this shortly after the legendary comedian passed away. Days after I went through countless talk show appearances and various interviews and yet I never heard him talk about this film.With all of that said I wasn't a fan of the original picture and this one here was pretty much more of the same as we get Davis and Lawford running around trying to be funny but being letdown by a pretty bland screenplay. There's just nothing fresh or original here and both stars just appear to be going by the numbers. What's even stranger is that Lewis stayed behind the camera yet he has Davis doing this strange scenes that just don't work. Davis is pretty much asked to act like Lewis but it's not funny and it's more awkward than anything else.The film has some fairly poor pacing and there simply weren't enough laughs here to make the film worth sitting through. If you enjoyed the first film then perhaps you'll enjoy this one a tad bit more than I did. The highlight is without question a cameo by a couple British stars.".

He's so indulgent ego driven and dismissive of the audience. The whole thing is an obvious love letter to Dean Martin that remakes the style of the old MartinLewis comedies. But people expected an Ocean's 11 spinoff not Sammy Davis Jr doing a Jerry impression for 34ths of the runtime. For Jerry fans it is one of his most bizarre and well budgeted films so Lewis makes his directing the star. It's never funny but it is experimental technically. It's dated and somewhat offensive politically racism is treated as a joke minorities buffoons women are ornaments and Lewis Sammy and Lawford are way too old to try to be hip or youthful. I enjoyed the minor action scenes which were the biggest stretch for Lewis and there is a clever plot in there not written by Jerry but it's trashed for long unfunny mugging takes and unoriginal slapstick that slows everything down. Some will find that genius but it's obviously Lewis exploiting the opportunity he was given and loading up on filler rather than thinking hard or saying anything or putting the sauced fun onset on to the screen.".

I watched this movie in the original Russian without subtitles. I do not speak Russian and I cannot say I am familiar with the country or its history. When I started to view it I found the directing and cinematography to be interesting so I continued expecting to shut it off and go to bed. Instead I was captivated by the story and could tell from the acting and foreshadowing what the story was about without understanding the language. In addition I fully understood the concepts and experiences portrayed at the point of climax and the message the film intended. I enjoyed this film because of its elements the love story intertwined with the wake up call to the younger generation known for forgetting the past confounded with unexpected twists that led them on an adventure of inner growth and a closer examination of the meaning of life nationality and sacrifice. I felt a greater interest in the Russian people after viewing this movie and it left that kind of lump in my throat wanting more sad for their loss and glad for what was gained. I did not expect such a melancholy feeling but I also felt after watching the movie that I needed it. I think this movie is a brilliant example of how a newer generation regardless of culture can romanticize the past even to the point of translating a gross evil invader into something cool or popular without even realizing what it means. This is a great movie for young adultsthoughtful yet entertaining sending its message directly to your heart.".

I was mislead by another reviewers comments about imagining present day men in black and though it to be about 'our present day occupied by an enemy'.But the story strikes to the values that many seem to hold in a different regard. Today we have tshirts mugs and screensavers paying homage to tyrants maniacs and killers of years ago and the swastika is tattooed on quite a few arms. I can only imagine how our forefathers having participated in major conflicts with some of these people would perceive our society which they fought and many died for.The hero's of the story collect war trinkets for a quick sale at the local pawn shop they play PC games depicting war scenes and yet it is only after their journey that they truly appreciate the horror of war the sentiment behind the trinkets and the real human effort that goes into earning the war medals they retrieve from the ground.That is not to say the film tries to make the present day ashamed of our activities but engender a deeper appreciation for the gallant efforts of those before us for the love of country and friend.It should be shown in many schools I do fear one day the US will find this film and try to make an 'English version' of which I am sure they will not do it justice.".

	schema:reviewBody "For me a Navy brat and AF wife I found this to be a powerful moving emotional film that literally sucks you in. It vividly portrays how much we owe everything we are and everything we have to those brave souls who fought and died in battles just like this to maintain the freedom we now enjoy and take for granted. I can honestly say this had me from the synopsis! What a clever premise! My hat is off to the creator and writer. It is the perfect moral lesson for those desecrating the graves of fallen soldiers. To experience all the raw emotions that go with war and see in such gutwrenching detail who these skeletons actually were during their days on earth alive and breathing was such a revelation. They went from dusty skulls and bones lying in dirt to flesh and blood human beings with feelings emotions thoughts and ideas. The choice was theirs and they sacrificed themselves valiantly. The nurse so beautiful dedicated and daring risking everything to crawl in the middle of the battlefield to check the fallen to protect those she could save. Their leadership trying to maintain an effective team of soldiers discipline fairly and encourage them on. And finally the soldiers themselves with all their human frailties the funny the sweet the sad the scared  downright terrified the loyal the triumphant and all of them flawed but incredibly heroic. It made it personal. It broke my heart to watch the blindage scene. My favorite part was when Vladimir's character I think they called him Skull? tries to scrape off his swastika tattoo. You can see they are visibly shaken and will never be the same. Great period piece authentic right down to the MosinNagants. Loved the music very good battle scenes I freaked watching the tanks run over their trench!. I was on the edge of my seat which is rare for me! I highly recommend this movie. Not just because its message is so aptly delivered but it is truly entertaining. It was called Back In Time when I watched it today on Amazon Prime.".

The elderly woman appears out of nowhere representing Mother Russia gives them milk and leads them to the lake that sends them back in time. Mother Russia herself teaches them to appreciate the sacrifices of those that have gone before.Unity and Nationalism are strong themes as the 4 say more than once that they have to return to the lake together and bring Sokolov's cigarette case the past with them in order to move forward into the future.

They end up maturing a decade or so in the course of a few days spent in the middle of the Patriotic War in 1942.  Only flaw in this fine film IMHO is that the director does not show the group giving the cigarette case to the old woman whom they wronged at the start of the adventure. This is mainly an intense war film with some scifi trappings. The four friends rapidly learn that loyalty patriotism and courage count for more than the latest game or nihilistic hanging out. Very good acting all around though the individual roles are from Central Casting the ultranationalist the nerd the puer aeternus the potentialtobealeader the brave female. SPOILER FOLLOWS The action proper begins when the group is approached by an old woman who asks them to find out what happened to her son who was MIA in 1942. The group laughs at her and shines her onwhy oh why don't we teach our kids to never ever wrong and old woman whom they meet in the wild? Yep she sends them back to 1942 on the eve of an offensive. Some temporal paradox here but the director crafts such a fine film that these are easily forgotten.".

The period battles are very impressively recreated but I couldn't help getting the feeling that the producers were so caught up with this aspect of the productions that some of the things that make a really satisfying movie were left out. The love story that there is seems sketched  the girl resists and then is suddenly completely in love with the hero. In the end the protagonists feel the terror of battle over glorioussounding music and return home humbled. Even this feels like it happened so quickly after they were so recently just trying to get themselves out of there and it seems like sentimentalization of the Great Patriotic War as it is known in Russia. In a film that is almost two hours long there is really no need for events to seem as rushed as they do due to set pieces being given precedence at the expense of characters and scenes.

Its not hard to follow.The film follows Yu Rim a DPRK agent sent to South Korea to gather information on the US activities in South Korea. The film is most infamous for having the four US defectors staring in them. The film is over 20 hours released in 20 parts. The English is overdubbed in Korea. Parrish plays a depressed Irish Man who is against the British Imperialist in his Northern Ireland Abshier plays an evil intelligence officer with the US Jenkins play Kelton a Schemer whos is trying to keep the war going to get profits and Dresnok plays Arthur a brutal commander of a POW camp. All the defectors surprising played there role well with the exception of Abshier who didn't seem to look like an evil officer. Anyway the movie portrays American's as evil Schemers South Koreans as puppets and the North Korean's as heroes and patriotic Koreans.".

The film is also fairly factual in how he began his career and the raid on Spanish controlled Panama at the end of the film actually happened in 1671. Film features fine color photography good atmosphere and realistic looking 17th. century costumes. There is a very exciting and well staged sword duel on the beach beautiful women including the voluptious Chelo Alonso a great musical score and for once the ships are authentic looking life size replicas and not the usual bathtub toy boats that too pirate movies feature. There's also a funny sequence where Morgan's mendressed as woman capture a Spanish treasure galleon. I remember watching it on the Channel 9 Million Dollar Movie in the New York area in the early 60s when it would be shown at 7.30 and 11.30 every weekday night for a week. I must have watched it 5 times! It was a fun movie then. I recently got to see it on VHS and it is still how I remembered it. Of course it does not have a Pirates of the Caribbean budget but it is not as overblown as those films. No supernatural events or fantasy elements just a well made and exciting pirate film that delivers on all levels. Steve Reeves best roleeven when compared to Hercules. His films are long overdue for a comeback. I hope it happens soon! This guy really deserves it.".

The costumes are quite historical with Reeves decked out in a slew of pirate regalia as the film progresses.  The music sets off this swashbuckler to a great extent.  Best music score around for this pirate tale.  Reeves survives a mini mutiny among his own pirate group spearheaded by a jealous cohort captain who Steve outduels in an excellent action sequence early in the film as Reeves establishes his authority as the overall leader of the pirates.  Some lovely women to look at in this film and Reeves does not appear overly muscular for the role.Plenty of pirate fighting and a good romantic ending for Captain Morgan.".

It laid out whether accurately or not I don't know Morgan's journey from slave to pirate coming fullcircle to give his former oppressors their comeuppance.There's plenty of great scenery in the movie as well. Steve Reeves is very buff in this flick no homo! D  and it's quite clear he's the squarejawed richlymaned hero of the flick! A baremidriffed Consuela is also quite a treat especially doing a slinky seductive dance with more moving parts than a Swiss watch! With fullsized ships at sea gorgeous sea shots and so on the film doesn't disappoint as far as scenery.The ending seemed a little abrupt which was probably the weakest part of the movie. I just expected a little more fleshingout or something... more. But even so it was a nice journey to get there.All in all I found it quite enjoyable and again I'm admittedly not into swashbuckler flicks so I'd consider that high praise for the movie. Enjoy!".

But even so it was a nice journey to get there.All in all I found it quite enjoyable and again I'm admittedly not into swashbuckler flicks so I'd consider that high praise for the movie. Enjoy!";

	schema:reviewBody "Although Panamanian filmmakers have finally been able to tell stories about their country its people and their lives most productions dealing with anything remotely Panamanian have been foreign. A few like Riffraff 1946 and The Tailor of Panama 2001 only used the country as decor while others as Charlie Chan in Panama 1940 and Across the Pacific 1942 were not even shot there. Only the documentary The Panama Deception 1992 or Paul Leduc's bizarre Dollar Mambo 1993 were more concerned dealing with something as dramatic as the US invasion of Panama in 1989. In recent years things have changed a bit and a few Panamanian features have been made as The Fists of a Nation 2006 Chance 2009 or The Dry Season 2012 with more in production or already released. I just finished watching Morgan the Pirate an ItalianFrench coproduction that ends with the taking of the city of Panama in 1671 under the direction of Andr de Toth whose claim to fame is the 1953 original version of House of Wax made in 3D and starring Steve Reeves in the lead as Sir Henry Morgan. Of course beautiful Chelo Alonso is on hand as an exotic prostitute who lives in the island of Tortuga and stages magnificent AfroCuban choreographies on the beach of the Italian island of Procida where exteriors were shot but the romantic interest was centered on vapid Valrie Lagrange I guess for coproduction reason with the French as the daughter of the Governor of Panama the richest city of the Americas as it is often identified in a couple of scenes. To be honest wholesome Steve Reeves was often betrayed by weak scripts and rushed editing that summarized complex stories in less than 90 minutes. Although he had the physique to play a mere great action hero in this film as a extremely handsome Morgan if one compares him to illustrations of the famous corsair he could have developed a more complex character than the demigods he often played in pplum sagas with the strong traits of Morgan's personality according to annals of history. But this is all absent in the script. It is true that Reeves was no Laurence Olivier but he functioned well in these epics and besides showing flair as a swordsman in galleons and taverns and against beautiful beaches and blue sea he seemed eager to try more dramatic roles. Unfortunately this was neither a rich production although it is well stated that the capture of the city of Panama was made after Spain and England had signed a peace treaty the violent campaign that included hundreds of men crossing the isthmus in a month through the jungle is trivialized and reduced to a romantic stroll through fields and hills and in spite of the great fires that destroyed the city and forced its people to change its location the city ends without scratches these are reserved to Mademoiselle Lagrange for a dramatic but false demise. With fine cinematography and music watch it as simple entertainment and if possible in Italian and its original widescreen format.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't claim I wasn't entertained.  MORGAN THE PIRATE is great fun just not the way that I expected.  I was looking for thrills and got laughs instead.I was psyched up to enjoy this movie right through the opening credits.  I was saturated with those glorious Technicolor shots full of blue water and white sails and I loved Franco Mannino's score.  Unfortunately it's all downhill from there.  Andre de Toth's direction is ludicrous from beginning to end.  Shall we start with the hamfistedness?  A Panamanian is buying a cow inspects her teeth and the seller declares it to be in prime condition. Pan to a slave girl whose teeth are also being inspected.  Okay we get the idea but just in case we miss the parallel the slave's seller says the SAME WORDS TO THE LETTER as the cow's owner does!That was my first hint that the movie was going to be bad but not until the action' scenes start did I realize just how funny it was going to be. Steve Reeves enslaved aboard a Spanish vessel leads a mutiny below decks. Instead of shooting the slaves from the hatchway the Spanish marines obligingly climb right down the ladder and fall directly into the slaves' hands without even putting up a fight!  Having thus gained some idea of the quality of his opposition Steve Reeves just blows off the rest of the action sequence it's obvious he isn't even trying.  He swordfights like a septuagenarian English country gentleman pointing out landmarks with a cane. When he has to knock a man overboard he just halfheartedly waves the stock of his musket at the victim who promptly goes flying.Then there's the dialogue.  Of course there is nothing easier than to poke fun at badly dubbed Italian movies.  But in this case to blame the translators and dubbers would be unfair since the original Italian dialogue obviously never made sense to begin with.  For example Dona Inez seeing a dying sailor slaps Captain Morgan and says You're nothing but a murderer!'  His answer  And you are beautiful!'  Wow what a splendid rebuttal!  It sounds even lamer if you remember THE SEA HAWK where Errol Flynn answers a similar accusation from a beautiful prisoner by gently pointing out that his actions are no different from those of Spanish military heroes'.The best laugh of all is when Morgan gives the order to abandon ship which his sailors proceed to do not by taking to the dories but by just diving overboard en masse!  But the amazingly incompetent editing is humorous too sometimes it looks like an early attempt to pioneer MTVstyle jump cutting. At another point a major patch of the movie simply goes missing in action. At one point Morgan and his pirates have been abandoned without ships Morgan having burned them on the beaches of Jamaica they then proceed to march overland to Panama!  The entire portion of the movie that explains how they got off the island of Jamaica to the Central American isthmus is just GONE!I won't bother criticizing the movie for lack of historical accuracy.  It's perfectly excusable to sacrifice historical accuracy in the name of a good story like in BRAVEHEART or in almost any Shakespeare play.  What I find more annoying is when the good stories in history are not exploited to their full potential.  This movie for instance is the second I know of THE BLACK SWAN is the other that wastes the dramatic possibilities of Henry Morgan. The historical Captain Morgan had all the qualities of a classic Hollywood villain diabolic charisma a penchant for treachery absolute ruthlessness a cunning genius for strategy insatiable greed and lechery.  He even had sinister bushy eyebrows and a Basil Rathbone mustache!  And filmmakers can't think of anything better to do with him than make him a hero?One parting shot if I'd been in Morgan's shoes I'd have told Dona Inez to go fly a kite.  Consuela for me!Rating  out of .Recommendation If you want to see a good movie skip it.  If you want to laugh at a bad one then by all means see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "You have to give Steve Reeves agent s a lot of credit for morphing him into a great action film such as this one. After two hugely successful Hercules films Reeves spun off his superman supermusclebulger personna in a number of sword and sandal type films and other historical characters. One such was the role of Henry Morgan in the great pirate film Morgan the Pirate. Most of the Italian made epics of the late 50s and early 60s such as the never ending Hercules type films were that they were made on skimpy budgets with shapely lovely starlets who would never make any Hollywood films. Some of Reeves love interests in those films were Mylene Demengeot Valerie LaGrange Chelo Alonso Georgia Moll and Ombretta Colli....didn't think any of those names rang a bell with you. As Captain Morgan Reeves is a slave to be sold off at an auction in a Panama market but the daughter of the governor Valerie LaGrange is smitten with him after witnessing a flogging and makes him her personal valet. Reeves mistakenly embraces her in a barn and is sent packing to a Spanish war galleon by the governor as a result  presumably never to be heard from again. After leading a slave revolt on a ship Reeves takes over and forms his own pirate band with him becoming the captain. On a raid Reeves discovers the governor's daughter has been captured on another pirate raid and he is smitten with her and wins her in a battle with another pirate captain. As the story goes Reeves and his band sink Spanish ships have endless fights with other pirates and Reeves becomes more and more powerful as the scourge of the seven seas...all along Reeves desires the love of his captive lady Lagrange but she fends him off wanting to go back to Panama and her freedom. After being set free by Reeves Capt Morgan she realizes she truly loves him and longs to see him again. After a failed attempt to capture the city of Panama in a raid it appears Morgan has drowned.....alas..Morgan is alive and then in another back entrance raid he and his pirate band capture the city and reunites with Lagrange. Reeves showed some true acting ability in this film and it is considered by his fans as his very best movie. There is a great musical score in this film also. Gets you in the mood for action. I'd rate this film in a pirate league with Captain Blood and The Black Swan.....two very formnable pirate tales. Reeves fans will love this movie.".

That said it's handsome enough particularly in the French print I watched and Franco Mannino's score is quite good as well.";

Subhash and his family are thrilled when Shankar returns home in the company of a gorgeous longlegged young woman named Pooja who he plans to marry soon. While Subhash adores both his sons he shows his open disappointment for Vishnu whose language childish actions and his affair with a Bollywood actress named Sapna are just few of his wrong actions. When Vishnu finds out that a Bollywood actor is attempting to start an affair with Sapna he angrily guns him down in front of several witnesses. Subhash asks Vishnu to leave the house and thereafter Vishnu is arrested and charged with murder. Then all hell breaks lose in the Nagre household when a politician named Motilal Khurana is killed and the killer names Subhash as the person who hired him to do this killing. ...";

We get that impression because Ramu says he is inspired by the Hollywood movie very kind of him. I have seen the movie and can confirm that approx 5 meets with what we have seen in Godfather. Talking about direction i could write a couple of pages about it but i prefer to say it is exceptional.

Abhishek tries to copy his father's angry look from yesteryear and does so brilliantly. Even Kay Kay Menon does a great job as the bad son.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is as well made as any of the better Ram Gopal Verma movies. The man knows the language of Cinema well and his technique flows very smoothly but what takes this movie upwards and above RGV's other movies are the stellar performances.The movie follows the story of the family of Sarkar a powerful 'Bhai' of Mumbai who runs his own law. He executes justice for the downtrodden in the way he deems right even if it may be as it invariably is outside the law. His seat of power the opposition to it and it's eventual inheritance is what the movie deals with.AB Sr. does his most balanced portrayal since Aks. His 'Sarkar' comes across as a person aware of the power he controls rather than one basking in it. And it is this underplayed demeanor that covers the Superstar we otherwise tend to see over the character he plays.AB Jr. plays 'Sarkar Jr' in the movie and he pulls off the doublewhammy of proving to be a worthy sonsuccessor of 'Sarkar Sr.'  AB Sr.  I say that coz the dad took a lot more years  movies to prove himself as good as what AB Jr has already proved himself to be.Most of the other characters are played by nonnames or smallnames but each of them paints their characters with a reality portrayal  these people ARE the characters they play. I have come to realize that one of the trademarks of a RGV movie is to use actors that have rarely been seen in roles otherwise leading the viewer into the character without any set expectationstypecasts.But put all of that aside  and watch Kaykay. He plays the elder son of Sarkar and does he play it. The director knows that this man can shout out words from his eyes what actors fail to do with their mouths and uses it to full advantage much to the delight of cinephiles. There are three distinct shots where the camera focuses on Kaykay's face and one shows only his eyes. What we see in them is as clear as this text you are reading. The fact that this man does so few movies and so far apart makes his performance much more valued coz one tends to forget how good an actor he is. Never is his name mentioned among the better actors of India and would it be even now? I would rate this above Company. The reason? Company was a movie about selective performance  Ajay  Vivek doing it then. But Manisha being the wonderful actor she is was nothing more than a distraction. And was Ajay Devgan ever able to shed his star from his role? No. As real as the movie's story was the picturization made it quite 'filmy'.The only other movie close to Sarkar in the RGV element is Satya  more so coz of the grittiness and lack of deliberate stylization. It stays in the real world creasing out any clichs that would give it a fictionalized feel.Sarkar is the movie that would be played in the tributes of everyone associated with it especially Ram Gopal Verma Amitabh Bachchan Abhishekh Bachchan and Kaykay if he ever has one.My Rating  4.55".

RGV proves himself a wonderful director who is truly different from most of the contemporary directors of today who make films for mass appeal. For a film like 'Sarkar' to get mass success it should be surprising. But go see the film and you will know why! IT is truly the best film of 2005 with 'Black'.The sets are wonderful...Dark and intense...and so is the look given to all characters. They were all very apt to the theme. The background score especially 'Govinda' one is truly intense and helps make you spellbound to this film. The editing is cool and thumbs to everyone behind this genius of a film.The most important thing here is the standout performances! Abhishek Bachchan handles his role very well and we see the rising superstar of tomorrow here. Great job by AB junior. Same goes for Kay Kay...he was superb as the bad son Vishnu. I don't actually agree where some people say he stole away the show...Because...it truly belonged to the Bachchans alone!!! The new meanie in town Rashid rocks!!! Truly what a performance man!!! Standing ovations to him...But if you are pitched against the actorAmitabh Bachchan in any film then he is sure to be too bhaari on you. He just excels like anything in this role. This is surely one of his finest performances and goes on par with that of Black. He truly beats Marlon Brando in the role. He makes you go spellbound with those piercing and intense eyes and stands tall and strong as the best actor ever born in Indian Cinema. He excels as GofatherSubhash Nagre and you get to feel the pulse of his power!!! Had Black not released the same year Bachchan needn't have worried...Because he would get all the awards and accolades for this performance in Sarkar. He proves himself the 'SARKAR' of bollywood...still going strong in an unbeaten 64!!! He is the ultimate actor without doubt.TWO THUMBS UP TO THE BACHCHAN ALL THE OTHER ACTOR AND RGV for such a great film!!!".

Hence if one thinks that Sarkar is an Indian remake of Coppola's The Godfather he might get disappointed as for fact even the director has not intended to revive the original Master piece.Sarkar is an Acting galore. After Agneepath we see the best performance of Amitabh Bachchan of his career. Here is an absolutely unique genre of Acting skill depicted by Amitabh Bachchan playing Subhash Nagare Sarkar illustrating all emotions through his Eyes. With very less dialogs spoken Amitabh Bachchan proficiently establishes a massive screen presence captivating the audience throughout the movie.Its finally proved that its only Amitabh Bachchan who can reach or excel the act of Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone from the original.Sarkar begins with a common man visiting Subhash Nagare seeking justice for his rapevictim daughter. The first 30 minutes is an explosive drama. The meeting with Rashid  Sarkar is riveting. The villains in the movie are like any other Hindi movie Villains and are shown larger than life which possibly was a setback unexpected from R.G.Verma Film.The strength of the movie drama again slightly suppresses by pale acting from KayKay who plays Sarkar's elder son. Abhishek as Sarkar's younger son is shown as obedient  modest as Al Pacino in The Godfather. The Script is then changed from the Original and in a better fashion to suit Indian cinema. The Elder son joins the Baddies  Sarkar is caught in a conspiracy of killing a honest politician. Sarkar is arrested and an attempt to murder Sarkar in Jail is planned by the baddies just when the younger son saves his father. The gradual transformation of Abhisekh's humble human person to the toughguy is splendid.The major drawback of the film includes the lack of display of the Operations  Business Conducts carried out by Sarkar. We don't come to know primarily what are their various source of income. What governs the strength of Sarkar ? What are the mutual benefits deriving from relationships of the Politicians with Sarkar ? In R.G.Verma's Satya  Company they perfectly dispayed the operations which the gangs conduct their source of income  various businesses they do. Finally the film is a journey revived through Agneepath where we relish the powerful performance of Superstar Amitabh Bachchan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sarkar a bolly wood remake of Godfather is not even remotely close to the original as par to execution wise. The next major fault of the movie is that RGV remained principal characters in the movie underdeveloped. Even the title character of the movie played by Mr. Bacchan is not clearly developed. But still this movie need some mentioned because for its powerful performances from lead cast. Specially the surprise element is the performance from Jr. Bacchan. If You disagree with RGV version that Abhiseikh is ahead of Big B in terms of natural talent of performing arts go and watch Sarkaar you will realize he has said nothing wrong. He least speaks and he performs with his eyes. Shahrukh  Amir this guy is superstar of tomorrow and like Hrithwik I can bet you cannot stop him. He is undeniably the best actor of this generation and Hrithwik Roshan is next to follow. Story is Crime Saga like all RGV films. Amitabh is the most powerful person in Bombay who believe in his own Principal and ethics. He run his unparalleled government and even Chief Minister of the state can do nothing against him as he has so much popularity in between masses. He believe in helping poor and helpless people and he is known for giving justice to the innocent one. The problem comes in his life when he deny to help his some of the colleagues for unethical work. Further he became victim of grand design operated by gangsters and Chief Minister of the state. For this purpose they even took help of his elder son. Suddenly a leader of the opposition played by Anupam Kher in the movie get murdered and Amitabh Bacchan became the prime suspect of all these. He became arrested but Abhiseikh his younger son took a mission to find out guilty. And finally he do what he owe from his heart. Love triangle between Katrina Abhiseikh  Tanisha runs along with the principal story in the movie. Anyway I love this movie because of the performances of Jr. B K.K. Menon  of course Big B.9 out of 10. Watch it you will definitely love it for some good reason it has to be 1st hit movie of next 6 month of year 2005.".

RGV fans will get their quota of unconventional camera angles and violence. The chantings of Govinda Govinda could have been little more subdued. Otherwise the background music is engaging.

	onyx:emotionText "a rushed project is what i can call this movie which had the potential to be great but the director Ram Gopal Verma just to imitate The Godfather  The Godfather II rushed so many things and made a mess of so many scenes.The movie is watchable for the performances  background score  some of Amitabh's lines are praise worthy but there are many contradictions within the character of Sarkar..At 1 moment SarkarAmitabh Bachchan says power is gained by joining people together not by making them go against you then when someone visits himRashid to strike a deal with him he himself acts in such an offensive way asking that man to become his enemy and forgetting his own basic rule.At another moment Sarkar says I don't interfere in other's business yet after telling Rashid that he wont do business with him he specifically calls him and tells him that he would not even let Rashid do the business himself.Notein the Godfather how wonderfully Marlon Brando tells Solozzo who comes 4 a similar deal that drugs is a dirty business etc etc and he cant help him but also he wishes him the best in whatever he does thats what should have been done here since Sarkar is a man for the people he should act nice even with an enemy so that he doesn't create a hostile environment around him Now the son played by AbhishekShankar Naagre and killing his own brother played by K.KVishnu Naagre this was put in just to copy the Godfather II and nothing else because it was so unconvincing the way it was handled it took two parts for The Godfather to show Michael Corleone order the killing of his own brother showing every inch of change in his character till the last scene of the Godfather II whereas in Sarkar it was rushed out of no where you see Shankar telling his father he killed his own brother  the reaction of the father was very bad it was not convincing at all as if not a son but an enemy died.So overall it was a good movie judging by Hindi movie standards but still for me it was a huge disappointment because when this movie was announced I thought RGV would handle it so well  make a movie better than his own Satya which remains his best movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicksthe Classic Godfather and yet another case of overhype due to media circus. Sarkar the 13th Hindi film of Ram Gopal Varma as director is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellentSatya and Company. The Charisma the magnetic persona of the two Bachchans playing fatherson duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for. Not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which Varma should be applauded. However the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film. Reasonthe other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp. the villains represent the typical Bollywood baddies. A character who attracts attention is elder son played by Kaykay but again not able to hold due to halfbaked characterization. . The Drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of Closeshots which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to construct an ambiance. The haunting Score Amar Mohile and the sound design Kunal Mehta Parikshit Lalwani  Anup Dev together with dark murky background overlapped by shinning powerful images camerawork by Amit Roy contributes to Visuals so typical of Ramu's style. But there is an overuse of Music though fortunately no songs are there in the film. But can interest of today's intelligently growing audience be sustained just on shoulders of two performers and strong Visuals ? I don't think so. Surely audience maangey more and here film fails to deliver. In any adaptation in order to add a new dimension the biggest prerequisite is the Screenplay which is sluggish here not being crisp at places and therefore the pace slackens quite often. What finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable very commonplace drama with very little surprise elements. Top Stunt director Allan Amin Ghani is also not in his best form. Some scenes which require a different treatment includes a Minister is talking foul about Sarkar and the son is overhearing a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on Sarkar Sarkar Jr. escapes from the clutches of his enemies a Son easily motivated to kill his own father a son is secretly entering his father's room to kill him a police commissioner slapping Sarkar Jrall this requires a more realistic hardhitting approach which is the backbone to create the required conflict. The dialogues are weak for eg. look at an amateurish line where a CM says to Sarkar Jr. Wo jo Police Commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya.. The women folk take on Sarkar's working is completely ignored. The uninterrupted negotiations about criminal activities while Sarkar is with his family also look slightly out of place In fact the film follows a graph quite similar to Ramu's own productionAb Tak Chhappan. In depicting the battle between good and evil the other side of lifethe law police administration politics is completely ignored. Certainly more is expected in content. Here the film definitely falls short and could not rise above an average fare. Dear Ramu agreed that now you are laughing your way to the bank you definitely need to take some drastic overhauling measures in your film production factory before it is too late.".

The flow of the movie was generally dullbecause scenes from the Godfather were created like the policeman slapping Abhishek Bacchan the older brother being killed by Abhishek like Fredo was killed on instructions of Pacino but too much was sought to be packed into the movie with too little story and depth to go with it. That was indeed the problem.If you try to pack 3 hours of intricate detail like a Godfather in 2 hours and that too with few dialogues what you get is a highlights show from a cricket match never making the full impact watching a full match will make.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all to put an end to the never ending debate to the Sarkar Vs Godfather this is NOT a Godfather and can never be one thanks to it's overhyped characterisation thin plot  most importantly an underplayed protagonist. When you see a director of the class of RGV making statements like I wanted to make this movie from 25 yrs ... This is my best movie so far .... your clinical analysis should be prefect. Read this review  you will appreciate why I've said so without any prejudice.First of all why do you think Godfather is bible for many young directors? Put it simply its characterisation its drama  powerful dialogues set amidst a realistically paced screenplay. Of course we need not copy Godfather but what we need to understand is the essence of filmmaking taken from the Godfather saga. RGV himself has attributed his inspiration from this film by which I will assume he does justice to its style of filmmaking. Unfortunately he disappoints in many sectors.1 The PLOT The whole plot of the movie is about two things  killing Sarkar  taking revenge on Sarkar's assassination attempt. This is where the film fails to justify its protagonist's role. Where have you seen Sarkars character growing.. sharing his principles with the family where did you see Sarkar's treatment of the business where is it captured the nuances of the character building?In fact the first 15 mins is the only place where Sarkar has been portrayed well. The rest just sidelines the main theme  SARKAR to a mere revenge plot killing saga of hero vs villain.2 Too many villains. This is a conventional storyline with too many caricatures throwing in as Goons. OK. now for comparison with Godfathermind you this is just the style of filmmaking  not the actual film have you seen a single villain glorified in the whole trilogy? The whole crux was on Godfather  his son how they manage the business. SIMPLE. You don't throw in loud music lots of characters to over emphasise a bad guy. This is absolute clich. Too many reels wasted on showing the bad guys when its not so important to show them.3 Too loud music. Whatever happened with RGV he seems to be choosing the wrong person for BG score these days. Amar Mohile is annoying and irritating most of the times. He doesn't know that adding music for every scene actually spoils the impact  effect. Besides if you notice there are 45 instruments used in the same scene  Sitar classical dhol violin. synths .. which change the mood of the film in seconds. For a dark movie you only need violin  bass. or else no music. Perhaps ar rahman or Sandeep Chowta are the only ones who know the basics in this dept.4 Underplayed characters. As mentioned Sarkar is underplayed. There is not much scope or role for him after 45 mins of the movie.  for all those who are praising AB's acting skills. they need to justify the same. There isn't much scope for him in this. I don't remember a single powerful yet subtle dialogue from him in this movie. It's a shame that a protagonist himself is underplayed. The only person who exemplified in acting in this movie was Kay Kay. Absolutely brilliant !!! But unfortunately we don't see much of his character being built up after the interval which is bad. There could have been so much scope to his dark shaded side. Abhishek is good nothing extra ordinary again. Yuva has much larger scope  its still his bestThere was so much talk about Sarkar's power. Unfortunaltey Amitabh looks helpless throughout the movie. He seems to be dependent on his sons  associates  post interval is a mere waste for his role. This is where RGV loses balance  focus. This movie is all about SARKAR  his power Remember Satya? not his chamchas not the villains not his sons. not the plot. So bingo ! You are lost again.5 Ending. A shabby ending which sounds quite banal. Son kills goons. takes over  he is now the DON. In fact they waste 30 mins of reel in the 120 mins just to show the chasing revenge killing which was all unnecessary. could have done in 5 minsThe bottomline is RGV like many others fail to understand why Godfather is such a prodigy in filmmaking. In an attempt to make an adaptation they only take the principle characters  leave behind the characterisation  the plot. But yes there are a few good moments in the film which deserver an applause for ex. Abhisheks reaction when he kills his bro etc. The cinematography is brilliant with it's black n grey shades. Talking of adaptations. Nayakan is a far better adaptation than Sarkar. In fact you will be taken aback by the power performance story  direction of that movie. Sarkar doesn't even come close to it. Sarkar fails on both the grounds  Godfather adaptation as well as RGV's capability Just to mention Satya still is a cult movie  remains his best direction till date. RGV probably is suffering from a post satya syndrome where he is self assuming his films to be near perfection sadly they are lost in the pipeline.".

Junior is also shaping up really well but he still needs to bring the nuances in his acting which is so essential for the accomplished actor. Rest of the cast has nothing much to do.As to comparison with Godfather it is not even remotely close in terms of execution and than there are so many things unexplained. Also characters of Baba which is a take on the pope in the original is a complete stereotype. Background music does not adds to the characterization although it goes with the moods of the movie but again it is nowhere close to Satya and Company both by Sandeep Chowta. Dialogues were not good enough leaving at one or two places. Again how does Abhishek comes to know about the mole is not explained. Also original was about the family and but this is only about father and son.If I were Ram Gopal Verma and the critic of good cinema I will not call it inspired by Godfather.

Camerawork is so amazing that it should put another Indian filmmakers to shame. The background score though repeated a few times is superb. The story is simple and predictable but its the execution which is simply excellent.Sarkar also boasts of some excellent performances by Amitabh and particularly Abhishek who proves his Bachchan surname in the last 20 minutes of the film. Seems like if he gets the right directors and the right roles he will be able to form a league of his own. Sarkar is a brilliant film and some people are dumb enough to look for godfather in this film and some idiots watch too much choprajohar crap that they have to criticise this film without any valid reason. Its a brave effort from RGV and it needs to be seen and admired. Well done Ram Gopal Verma and thank you for a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's messed up I know but I enjoyed this movie. The Flower Girl is perhaps North Korea's most successful film both abroad and in the homeland. It is something I think everyone should watch  not because it is an especially brilliant movie in terms of plot or acting but I think it gives a rare insight into this sort of propaganda cinema. It is set in the 1930s which is of course during the Korean Independence Movement. Supposedly it is based on one of Kim ilSung's six operas. There are a few songs that are part of the plot which I imagine are arias taken from the opera.At times I thought that this film was made with people in mind who have never watched a featurelength film before as this is the only audience who would be subliminally affected by the antiJapanese sentiment or the love of the Juche Idea. Anyone else would surely find the propaganda obvious. Toward the end it becomes more honest in its ideology by calling the Japanese 'Japs' at least in the English subtitles. One of the main characters claims almost in direct address We've lost our country and This is the tragedy of a stateless nation.The story itself is of Kotpun the subject of the film's title who is trying to sell flowers to support her sick mother and blind sister SunHui. Amongst other hardships they manage to raise enough money for the medicine but shortly after buying it the mother is found dead. The soundtrack generally reflects the awful pop music of North Korea. It must be diatonic! Major tonality! Uplifting! So when it becomes melancholy or violent to add the vilification of certain characters is it fairly effective and shocking probably more so for an audience who has never heard such music. The best part of the score for me was a scene early on where the sick mother is fatigued and struggling to clean clothes for a landlord. There is a devastating longing solo cello piece playing that almost compensates for the hilarious acting. When you see Kotpun and SunHui reunited after being apart you even get some John Williamsesque 'going home' music think E.T. Jurassic Park. Maybe this moment was symbolically pushing reunification?As stupid as it sounds the change of Kotpun's face is a way of keeping track of the narrative. She is consistently beautiful but after every problem she faces her makeup becomes more patchy and her hair more erratic. Hilariously after listening to and agreeing with a motivational speech by a villager who is probably representing Kim ilSung there is a cut to a completely different scene and location and she looks even happier than at the start. To me this looked like a humorous polar opposite of Thelma  Louise two characters that you enjoy more once they start to look messy.Overall I did enjoy The Flower Girl but only because I imagined it wasn't from North Korean filmmakers and took a completely different reading. Sometimes you will hear the people of North Korea being called blind hopeless cases brainwashed idiots etc. but that view shows a total lack of empathy. I think this movie shows  though not deliberately  that under particularly desperate circumstances it's possible to think that the weirdest of ideologies might be helpful to you. Go watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts in a small nameless village somewhere in Korea during the Japanese colonial era. Wicked capitalist farmers backed by the Jap Imperial Army oppress the Korean people but none more so than the titular character. Her father is dead from overwork her mother is indebted to his former employers and has to do their laundry and grind rice into flour for their constant banquets despite her own life threatening illness. These vile capitalists beat and abuse their workers and give out charity to the peasants in the form of rice rations that have to be paid back at a 21 ratio. As if there were not enough suffering in Koppun's life her little sister was blinded by the farmer's wife for daring to touch a roasting nut when she was hungry. The evil woman threw a pot of boiling wild ginseng into Sun Hi's face blinding her for life. Koppun's older brother is arrested by the Japanese at the behest of the farmers after he sets fire to their store rooms to avenge his sister's injury and is promptly shipped off to prison without trial.Koppun's life goes from bad to worse after this point and she is forced to sell flowers to get medicine for her mom who can't earn any money for herself as she is basically a slave to the Korean version of Kulaks. Her efforts are hampered even though she has enough hope to cover the whole village. Japanese collaborators spit on her call her dirty and generally treat her very poorly. With help from a kindly old woman from the market she manages to eventually scrape together enough money to buy the medicine but on the very day that she reaches her goal her mother reaches a turning point in her terminal illness and spills some rice flour because she is too weak to lift the bowl. She is then beaten to within an inch of her life by the farmer and the sickness takes care of the rest. Koppun and Sun Hi are blissfully unaware of this and are skipping towards home with the cure laughing and playing. This fleeting happiness is cut short when they meet the funeral procession coming down the road. A heart wrenching exploitative scene follows with much wailing and beating of chests. It goes on too long. An authoritative voice comes out of nowhere asking who is to blame for this tragedy. The question is left unanswered as the audience obviously know the answer. Psst. It's the Capitalist farmers and their Japanese organ grinders. Because her mom is now dead the farmer wants to sell Koppun into slavery to get his money back. She knows that the only way to survive is to find her older brother. She flees in the dead of night and has to travel many weeks to the prison. Upon arrival she is told that her brother has perished. Filled with despair she contemplates throwing herself into the sea. The movie goes all Carnival of Souls at this point with a kaleidoscopic montage of the various oppressions meted out to the Korean people at the hands of the Japanese and their lackeys swirling around her head. Then she thinks of Sun Hi and is determined to return home. Meanwhile back on the farm Sun Hi is sobbing uncontrollably because she misses her sister. The farmer's wife takes ill and it's time for the movie to strike out at religion as another source of needless suffering. The priest believes that the spirit of the little girl's mother has come back and possessed her because the farmer's wife fell ill at around the same time as the sobbing started. The woman also has feverish hallucinations about all the evil she has done in her life compounded by hearing the sobs of the girl that she has blinded. The farmer sends out one of his henchmen to take care of the demon. He tricks the blind girl into going with him on the promise that he will take her to Koppun. He leads her off to the mountain just as Koppun nears the village.The final fifteen minutes of the movie all collapse in on themselves as the themes explored up to this point take a back seat to North Korean propaganda. Koppun learns of her sister's fate and is the first person to revolt. She has just had too much she bursts into the farmer's house and demands the return of her family. She throws a pot of boiling water at the farmer's wife but is eventually overpowered by a goon and thrown into a granary to be killed later or sold off as a slave. All seems lost until her older brother is shown walking in the mountains with his Korean Revolutionary Army buddy. He did not die in prison but escaped and joined Kim Il Sung's brave revolution. The two men find an old hermit who is friendly to the revolution and by some miracle Sun Hi has been saved by this old guy. The farmer's lackey was apparently too much of a coward to kill her outright opting instead to leave her on the mountain to die. After this reunion they go back to the farm and discover Koppun's fate. Under the leadership of the KRA the peasants overrun the farmer and his entourage of comically stereotypical capitalist characters. Hammers flash sickles sparkle in the moonlight as the farmer is paid back for is oppression in what I estimate is a 21 ratio.The movie ends with Koppun saved and reunited with her remaining family members the peasants liberated the Japanese vanquished and the farmer his wife and his gang of hoodlums dead. Long live the KRA. Long live United Korea. Long Live Kim Il Sung.".

She knows that the only way to survive is to find her older brother. She flees in the dead of night and has to travel many weeks to the prison. Upon arrival she is told that her brother has perished. Filled with despair she contemplates throwing herself into the sea. The movie goes all Carnival of Souls at this point with a kaleidoscopic montage of the various oppressions meted out to the Korean people at the hands of the Japanese and their lackeys swirling around her head. Then she thinks of Sun Hi and is determined to return home. Meanwhile back on the farm Sun Hi is sobbing uncontrollably because she misses her sister. The farmer's wife takes ill and it's time for the movie to strike out at religion as another source of needless suffering. The priest believes that the spirit of the little girl's mother has come back and possessed her because the farmer's wife fell ill at around the same time as the sobbing started. The woman also has feverish hallucinations about all the evil she has done in her life compounded by hearing the sobs of the girl that she has blinded. The farmer sends out one of his henchmen to take care of the demon. He tricks the blind girl into going with him on the promise that he will take her to Koppun. He leads her off to the mountain just as Koppun nears the village.The final fifteen minutes of the movie all collapse in on themselves as the themes explored up to this point take a back seat to North Korean propaganda. Koppun learns of her sister's fate and is the first person to revolt. She has just had too much she bursts into the farmer's house and demands the return of her family. She throws a pot of boiling water at the farmer's wife but is eventually overpowered by a goon and thrown into a granary to be killed later or sold off as a slave. All seems lost until her older brother is shown walking in the mountains with his Korean Revolutionary Army buddy. He did not die in prison but escaped and joined Kim Il Sung's brave revolution. The two men find an old hermit who is friendly to the revolution and by some miracle Sun Hi has been saved by this old guy. The farmer's lackey was apparently too much of a coward to kill her outright opting instead to leave her on the mountain to die. After this reunion they go back to the farm and discover Koppun's fate. Under the leadership of the KRA the peasants overrun the farmer and his entourage of comically stereotypical capitalist characters. Hammers flash sickles sparkle in the moonlight as the farmer is paid back for is oppression in what I estimate is a 21 ratio.The movie ends with Koppun saved and reunited with her remaining family members the peasants liberated the Japanese vanquished and the farmer his wife and his gang of hoodlums dead. Long live the KRA. Long live United Korea. Long Live Kim Il Sung.";

The version I saw at that time was atrociously dubbed in English with characters from the south of Italy given a youall southern drawl.

Tognazzi aged 51 marries his beautiful 17yearold goddaughter Muti whom he has not seen since her baptism. The story centers around Tognazzi's jealousy when he returns from a trip to find his young wife making out with a young police officer Michele Placido whom he had befriended after a violent union dispute.  Although he likes to pride himself on his liberal attitudes in sexual matters as he does in his politics when he becomes an oldfashioned cornuto his reaction is not so tolerant nor should it be and he orders the girl out of the house. She goes to stay with the cop. The two men fight over her. She leaves. Years go by.  The cop is married to someone else. Tognazzi wants to rekindle the romance with Muti now a successful fashion designer. The stuff of this film is somehow tired and the story never comes to life. And what might have been a very respectable little domestic comedy turns out to be insistently shrill and uninvolving. Mario Monicelli director of the famed Big Deal on Madonna Street has made much better films and this one struck me at times as a pale imitation of some of the elements of Ettore Scola's Dramma della gelosia made a few years earlier.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the big problems with 1970's Italian comedies is that they are either available only in Italian and thus difficult to understand if you're not too fluent in that language or they are VERY badly dubbed into English which to my mind is much worse. Inept dubbing doesn't necessarily hurt your silliest sex comedies i.e. the ones featuring the likes of Lino Banfi Gloria Guida etc. but it is death to the ones that are halfway serious like this one. A factory foreman influential union leader and allaround workingclass hero who claims to have bedded 3000 women! decides to get married at the age of 51 to his 17yearold goddaughter. This may sound pretty perverse but since she is played by Ornella Muti I'm sure no one would hold it against him. He believes he has progressive modern attitudes about sex but these attitudes are severely tested when he starts to suspect his young wife is cheating on him with a handsome military officer Michele Placido. And he becomes downright crazed when he realizes his suspicions may very well be justified.This is a very Italian movie given that the hero is basically a philandering communist and his wife is about half a traditional Italian workingclass woman and about half a modern free love 70's chick. Unfortunately the guy is dubbed with an accent that sounds more like Queens than Italy and Muti for some reason talks like Scarlet O'Hara! The bad dubbing distracts greatly from any serious gravitas the movie might have or any comment it might be making about modernday amore all'italia and the relation between the sexes. As a sex comedy on the other hand it isn't as funny as some nor does it seem to aim to be particularly titillating despite several nice nude scenes by Muti.NoShame or somebody like that might someday release a subtitled version that would no doubt make it much easier to appreciate. But whether this movie is any good or notwell it's hard to tell when it's dubbed by a bunch of clowns like this.".

ROMANZO POPOLARE or come and meet my wife is not in the same league as those two classics.An ageing factory worker ugo tognazzi seduces his teenage goddaughter the gorgeous and sizzling ornela mutti and marries her. the film begins medias res with the two of them already married.

Ugo is an active communist and when one of his comrades injures a young handsome policeman during a demonstration Ugo does the decent thing and invites him over for cards. The policeman moves in on the feisty Mutti when Ugo is away to attend a funeral.The film is a comedy that never really takes off. It depends too much on the two main actors  both Ugo and Mutti are fantastic. Mutti was such a hot young woman. She plays working class italian women really well. She is as intense and convincing as she was in Damiano Damiani's THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WIFE. But there isn't much in the script. There are'nt too many memorable scenes I watched the whole thing only because of the two charming leads. And despite it being a sex comedy I was given only a few glimpses of Mutti's nude body.I enjoyed some of the gimmicks like the freeze frames where the characters pause to reflect on their life situation. The film does capture a changing society that allows more freedom choice and social mobility for women. Mutti's character rejects both her husband and her boyfriend in the end to work and support her kid on her own. It celebrates female sexuality in a way that might offend feminists of today  the handsome policeman kisses gropes and jumps on Mutti many times before she makes love to him after protesting first. There is even a song that goes I'm a woman not a saint.The rambunctious pippo starnazza who plays ugo's neighbor and comrade was quite amusing. The poppy background score was quite catchy.610".

The fights are intricate concentrating on exotic weapons and styles but mixing it up with some proxy fighting and concealed technique. It neatly avoids recently popular pitfalls such as overt cgi spectacle massing sheer volumes of Mainland extras or lingering on glamour shots of pecs and shimmering hair weaves.

	schema:headline " A classic entry into the 'wuxia' genre this martialarts epic delivers an experience both thrilling and poignant";
	schema:reviewBody "Ten years ago Lee Ang's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon breathed new life into the 'wuxia' genre and opened up the world of Chinese cinema to mainstream Western audiences. Had Reign of Assassins arrived ten years earlier it could have very well have achieved the same groundbreaking success as Lee Ang's classic for make no mistake this dazzling martial arts epic ranks among one of the best of its kind.In writerdirector Su ChaoPin's ancient China as told over an enchanting animated sequence there are different sects of assassins after the ancient remains of a mystical Indian monk. Among the most deadly are a squad known as the Dark Stone led by the formidable and distinctively raspyvoiced Wheel King Wang Xueqi. Drizzle Kelly Lin is the most powerful member of the squad but she has had enough of her life of killing and goes under the knife to emerge as Zeng Jing Michelle Yeoh.Just the names of the characters will do well to convince you that this is pure fantasy but while the world may be makebelieve the characters within them are firmly grounded. Su's script takes its time in the first hour to set up the romance between Zeng Jing and messenger boy Jiang AhSheng Korean star Jung Woosung their courtship unfolding with a gentle touch of humour and more than a hint of the film's title  as well as their subsequent married life. Audiences waiting for some action will have to be a bit more patient as Su wants his audience to get to know his characters well and gives them time to grow on you.It is almost a good hour into the film by the time Wheel King and his gang of assassins Lei Bin Shawn Yue the Magician Leon Dai and Zhan Qing Barbie Hsu track down Zeng Jing on their quest to find the remains. Yet the care and attention to detail that Su pays to each one of his characters pays off beautifully in the second half. Refusing to cast his characters as blackandwhite heroes and villains Su gives each a backstory that blends slickly into the various circumstances the plot throws them into. And in between the balletic action choreographed by Hong Kong's Tung Wai Su draws on the relationships among the various characters for some intriguing drama especially the dynamics between Zeng Jing Wheel King and his three fellow assassins.It is this tight characterisation that holds the second half of the film together. While the plot in the first half may seem Mr and Mrs Smith simplistic in its portrayal of a married couple unaware of the other's past the second half of the film is anything but. Unfolding with twists and turns it builds on an engaging first hour to become even more absorbing culminating in a breathtaking and ultimately touching emotional finish that reaffirms the power of love to overcome hatred and vengeance and selfsacrifice.Though Su's film is heavy on drama it also delivers on the action where it matters. Tung Wai avoids any pretentious visual effects in favour of oldschool wireful swordplay in all its grace and poeticism though he does use modernday technology to throw in some nifty moves like bending swords and flying needles in slomo. The very first confrontation between Zeng and her enemies in her house is enough to set your pulse racing and Tung Wai tops that with another equally if not more thrilling fight in her house later on and a twoway fight in an open courtyard. Su is less of a director of action films his filmography reads the 2002 comedy Better than Sex and the 2006 horror film Silk so the fact that the action sequences in here have turned out well must have been due in part to producer John Woo's participation as codirector.Woo's involvement has also ensured the excellent cast assembled here. Michelle Yeoh's role in this film is a welcome return to form for the actress that has not had such a meaty role tailormade for her since Lee Ang's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Her natural beauty and elegance complements Zeng Jing's graceful assassin perfectly and serves as a good foil against costar Jung Woosung's rugged handsomeness. Yeoh and Jung also share great chemistry and it is firmly to their credit that the film ends on a deeply poignant note.Like the best of its genre Reign of Assassins has all the ingredients for a modernday 'wuxia' classic tight characterisation compelling drama and exciting action topped with fantasy elements. Su Chaopin and John Woo have created a genre classic ten years after Lee Ang's masterpiece and it is a thrilling and poignant experience worthy of the best martial arts epics.".

	onyx:emotionText "Ten years ago Lee Ang's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon breathed new life into the 'wuxia' genre and opened up the world of Chinese cinema to mainstream Western audiences. Had Reign of Assassins arrived ten years earlier it could have very well have achieved the same groundbreaking success as Lee Ang's classic for make no mistake this dazzling martial arts epic ranks among one of the best of its kind.In writerdirector Su ChaoPin's ancient China as told over an enchanting animated sequence there are different sects of assassins after the ancient remains of a mystical Indian monk. Among the most deadly are a squad known as the Dark Stone led by the formidable and distinctively raspyvoiced Wheel King Wang Xueqi. Drizzle Kelly Lin is the most powerful member of the squad but she has had enough of her life of killing and goes under the knife to emerge as Zeng Jing Michelle Yeoh.Just the names of the characters will do well to convince you that this is pure fantasy but while the world may be makebelieve the characters within them are firmly grounded. Su's script takes its time in the first hour to set up the romance between Zeng Jing and messenger boy Jiang AhSheng Korean star Jung Woosung their courtship unfolding with a gentle touch of humour and more than a hint of the film's title  as well as their subsequent married life. Audiences waiting for some action will have to be a bit more patient as Su wants his audience to get to know his characters well and gives them time to grow on you.It is almost a good hour into the film by the time Wheel King and his gang of assassins Lei Bin Shawn Yue the Magician Leon Dai and Zhan Qing Barbie Hsu track down Zeng Jing on their quest to find the remains. Yet the care and attention to detail that Su pays to each one of his characters pays off beautifully in the second half. Refusing to cast his characters as blackandwhite heroes and villains Su gives each a backstory that blends slickly into the various circumstances the plot throws them into. And in between the balletic action choreographed by Hong Kong's Tung Wai Su draws on the relationships among the various characters for some intriguing drama especially the dynamics between Zeng Jing Wheel King and his three fellow assassins.It is this tight characterisation that holds the second half of the film together. While the plot in the first half may seem Mr and Mrs Smith simplistic in its portrayal of a married couple unaware of the other's past the second half of the film is anything but.

The Reign of Assassins gave me the feeling of watching one of the great classics. It's story is not the most original but it gives a nice background for the viewer to see the beautiful acting and action scenes. At times it's a love story at others a suspense flick with all the intrigue. The actors do a good job in conveying their emotions to the audience. Most of the characters get fleshed out so your not only interested in the main characters. Story wise I have to say that some of the things were a bit confusing but if you paid attention it all made sense. The action scenes are plenty and well choreographed. The fighting was made believable nothing was over the top. I especially liked how the action sometimes slows down just to show the viewer how things are done. This brings the action more to life and you actually notice all the small gestures the actors need to make in order to sway or dodge an attack. Overall I liked the movie and I highly recommend fans of the genre to watch it. I surely enjoyed it.".

I will not say that they are overly interesting but they don't distract from the story either. The best part of the movie for me was how it actually caught me off guard. The plot twist actually made me laugh as I never saw it coming and I thought I have seen it all in martial art movies.There are some parts that are funny some that are sexy. parts that are exciting and parts that are wholesome.

	schema:reviewBody "The Dark Stone gang is tracing the remains of a Buddhist priest because the rumour is that the person who owns those remains will rule over the kung fu world. One of the assassins kills the person who owns half of the corpse and then makes off with it thereby betraying her gang. She then meets Wisdom a martial arts master turned monk who teaches her that her deed was wrong she therefore seeks a physician who can change her face for her turning her into Zeng Jing the lovely Michelle Yeoh. In her new identity she becomes a fabric merchant in the big city where she meets and falls in love with messenger Jiang Asheng Woosung Jung soon they marry and appear to have a tranquil life together. But all is not as it seems not only is Zeng Jing not who she says she is but neither is Jiang Asheng and in the meantime her old gang among others continues to search for their erstwhile companion  and the remains of the monk....This 2010 film was Michelle Yeoh's first wuxia film since the acclaimed Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and she is as beautiful and graceful as ever playing a rather complex character who is adept at hiding who she really is yet capable of sincerely falling in love even when she's perhaps first and foremost a killer. The martial arts fights are amazing but never sillylooking and the supporting characters are all welldrawn including a young woman brought into the gang to take Zeng Jing's place a magician who uses both martial arts and magic to defeat his enemies and the leader of the Dark Stone gang a eunuch who wants nothing more than to be a real man yet who is more skilled a fighter then all of them. Must of this story takes place in cityscapes and at night so we don't have the lovely landscapes sometimes seen in historical martial arts films but with Yeoh illuminating the screen with her graceful presence who needs mere trees and mountains?".

In a FaceOff turn she goes under the knife and now has the face of Michelle Yeoh whoa! living in disguise in the city flying below the radar and effectively living the simple ordinary life she yearns for with absolutely no need for picking up the sword though always kept handy at home just in case trouble comes knocking.The panAsia Alist cast is something that will draw attention to the film coming from Taiwan Hong Kong China and Korea. It's been some time since I last saw a wuxia film that featured a female swordsman as the lead and being the antiheroine at that as well. Starting off as a killer Michelle Yeoh's Zeng Jing is unfortunately dubbed over though I suspect for a valid reason that we'll have to live with in this film. In fact more than one more character has voice issues that I cannot elaborate and when revealed you'd start to wonder whether martial arts films can ever distance itself from that kind of villain from the courts which is rather clichd. Yeoh will undoubtedly bring comparisons with her other famous martial arts role from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon although here Barbie Hsu's no Zhang Ziyi to steal that thunder or limelight being cast as a psychotic nymphomaniac with a penchant to shed her clothes in the hope of climbing the power ladder sorry guys no nudity involved.What shines in this film is the rich characterization beyond the usual onedimensional characters in most martial arts flick which gives the viewer a richer experience as we get emotionally invested in the plight of the characters. Everyone seems to want a way out of their usual kill or be killed drudgery though it's one thing leaving the Jiang Hu altogether and retire and another if you actually belong to a gang of bandits and assassins where your ex buddies just won't leave you alone. The story allowed for any available screen time to pause for a while to present the other ordinary side of the characters where we see their hopes and dreams whether be it settling down gaining some worldly possession. I had initially wondered why Wang Xueqi was cast since he's an incredible actor but had little to do in the first half of the film other than to look mean and nasty but then realized that you need an actor of gravitas to pull off what he did in the latter half of the film which in the hands of a lesser actor could have been really comical. Instead he brought that sense of an obsessed man whose desperate for what's almost an impossible change or dream which form the crux of all misery. The other actor to be admired here is Korean actor Jung Woosung who plays a courier and falls in love with Zeng Jing. Spending time to ensure he learns his Mandarin dialogue as accurately as possible so that when dubbed over it will look convincing I will have to agree that he pulled it off and his good looks fit right into this period piece with some surprises up the sleeve.Action fans will have something to look forward to in the film as it spends time crafting kinetically charged swordfighting scenes which at times I felt the quick cuts didn't do those choreographed moves much justice. However everyone pretty much battles everyone else which accentuates the good old wuxia adage of it being perfectly normal if selfpreservation happens to be the order of the day. Throw in motivations of revenge lust though very subtle and jealousy especially with two women characters sharing the same scene we know we're in for a good time especially when the story's kept tight and compact. Some wonderful set action pieces like the one in the bank and the disturbance at home all make for good entertainment and clearly with John Woo absent from giving his two cents worth in these scenes no slow motions if you get what I mean though not always necessarily for the better as the quick cuts sometimes get in the way of appreciating the hard work gone behind the designing of such battles which are wireenhanced.At its core Reign of Assassins is a romantic tale steeped in tragic irony with martial arts film fans likely to lap up an out and out fantastical wuxia film. Almost all the characters have a past they want to cease remembering and are harbouring plans for a new life sans violence. Love of course plays a part in the determination of this second chance but this calls for sacrifice that we see once enemies now lovers have got to embrace as they decide to come clean with their feelings alongside twists that get revealed especially in the final act.Compared to Detective Dee this may not seem as epic nor groundbreaking in terms of offering something new to an audience but it is essentially its sublime essence in knowing what's critical in a wuxia film and doing that well at times giving you that feeling of having watched a classic martial arts film of old now remade with a stellar cast and knowing how best to appeal to a modern audience. Highly recommended and it powers its way into my shortlist at the end of the year as well.".

	schema:headline " Great plot great acting great action sequence.";
	schema:reviewBody "I was dragged to watch this film because I've never enjoyed Michelle Yeoh's works. It doesn't help that when the first dialog was spoken it was in mandarin. I was like OMG! How am i to last 2 hours in a mandarin movie? But this movie really surprised me... in a pleasant way  The action sequence is one of the best I've seen since the 90s ! The story build up is easy to follow even though I hardly understand mandarin. The character development is very good and this is rarely seen in Chinese swordfighting flicks. Most swordfighting flicks involved a hero a villain a goal and loads of swordfights between good and evil. In Reign of Assassins viewers are treated with plenty of reasonable twists throughout the movie enough depth into the lead characters for viewers to empathize with them And of course excellent choreography to make it into the action flick that it is meant to be.To try to summarize the story without giving away the twists in the movie will only serve to make the movie sound uninteresting. All i can say is for those who is uncertain whether to watch this movie should go ahead and watch it. I watched it on the big screen 9 times already... broke my personal record. That i think says a lot about how interesting this movie can be.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the Ming Dynasty there was a legend about the mystical powers of the missing remains of an Indian Buddhist monk that would be capable to heal anything and would become a great kungfu fighter. When the leader of the Dark Stone gang Cao Feng Xueqi Wang discovers that Prime Minister Zhang possesses half of the powerful remains he sends a team of assassins to kill the minister and his son Zhang Renfeng Xiaodong Guo. However the skilled Xi Yu Kelly Lin flees with the remains and kills Renfeng who fall off a bridge in a river. Then Xi Yu meets the monk Wisdom that advises her that she has four flaws fighting with her sword and she might be killed by Cao Feng that has trained her.Xi Yu goes to the renowned plastic surgeon Dr. Li that changes her face and she decides to start a new life in a small village. She assumes the identity of Zeng Jing Michelle Yeoh and poses of merchant and soon she marries the quiet and clumsy Jiang Asheng Woosung Jung. When there is a robbery in the local bank Zeng Jing is forced to fight to protect her and her husband from being killed disclosing her skills to Cao Feng. Now he sends Lei Bin Shawn Yue Lian Sheng Leon Dai and Ye Zhanqing Barbie Hsu who are his three best assassins to retrieve the remains and kill Zeng Jing and her beloved husband. The talented Michelle Yeoh is one of the most beautiful Chinese actresses and her movies are usually great. In Jianyu a.k.a. Reign of Assassins we have not only Michelle Yeoh but also the hands of John Woo. The result is a great film of the genre with predictable but not less engaging twists and a romantic conclusion. The choreography of sword fights is breathtaking and the music score is wonderful. Fans of the genre will certainly adore the awarded Jianyu. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Reino dos Assassinos Reign of the Assassins".

	schema:reviewBody "Review I quite enjoy this movie but I didn't know what was going on towards the end. The sword action is great because the director didn't go overboard with the string action and the basis of the storyline was well written but once the characters true identity starts to unfold it became a bit of a mess. Its about a legendary Buddhist Monk called Bodhi whose mummified remains are believed to have mystical powers. One half of the remains are in Prime Minister Zhang's hands so the Dark Stone gang send out there assassins to kill him and his son Renfeng. The top assassin for the Dark Stone gang Drizzle Michelle Yeoh steals the remains and flees the scene. On that same night when Drizzle was trying to get out of town she comes across Renfeng on a bridge whose seeking revenge for the murder of his father so she kills him and comes across a monk Wisdom Calvin Li who demonstrates to Drizzle that her sword skills have four fatal flaws which could be her downfall if she comes against a master. After 3 months of living together Wisdom attempts to make Drizzle leave her assassin life behind but she ends up killing him leaving her with guilt and sorrow. She then goes to a famous surgeon so she can change her appearance and pursue a new life as Zeng Jing. After the surgery she becomes a cloth merchant and she marries the village messenger Ahseng Jung Woosung. The Dark Stone gang recruit a new assassin Turquoise who has no remorse and due to be killed after killing her fianc and inlaws on her wedding night. As there still on the hunt for Drizzle they send out there top assassin Fatty Chen who is mysteriously murdered so there head leader the Wheel King goes on the hunt for her. During a bank robbery in there village Zeng Jing saves her husbands life which reveals her old identity to the Dark Stone gang because of her unique sword skills. When the Dark Stone gang finally come face to face with Drizzle they offer to spare her and her husbands life if she gives up her half of the remains and helps them find the other half so she agrees to there terms. When the Dark Stone collects all of the remains the gang refuse to let her go and they end up turning on each other. After a big sword fight Drizzle returns home badly wounded in front of her husband. 2 of the Dark Stone assassins follow her and come face to face with her husband who surprises them with a pair of CenCi swords which were used by Renfeng. After defeating the assassins he takes his wife to the surgeon to help her with her fatal wounds. We then see that her husband is really Renfeng who didn't die from Drizzle's sword on the bridge and has also had surgery to change his appearance. When Drizzle finds out the truth Ah seng tells her that there relationship is over because of what she and the Dark Stone gang had done to his family. Although he wants to kill her he obviously has true feelings for her so he just tells her to leave. Meanwhile the Wheel King tries to use his new powers to correct his castration that happened when he was a boy and when Turquoise finds out his defect whilst seducing him the Wheel King gets angry and buries her alive under a bridge. He then gets a signal from Drizzle who has decided to engage him in a final battle at a graveyard. When he arrives he sees Renfeng dead and he starts to fight Drizzle who uses the technique that she was taught by Wisdom to defeat him. As Drizzle used a special drug to make her husband seem dead so he could witness her defeat the Wheel King he sees that she is badly wounded but still alive and he carries her home. Confusing but detailed and well put together. One of the biggest let downs for this movie is the subtitles which were going at the speed of light. I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie much more if I knew what they were saying. With that aside the whole look and feel of the movie was impressive and the actors put in good performances especially Michelle Yeoh. The love story was sweet and the scenery was authentic but they over complicated the storyline. Watchable!RoundUp This movie was directed by ChaoBin Su who brought you Silk in 2006 and B.T.S. Better Than Sex in 2002. He hasn't got a lot of experience behind the camera but he had the help of John Woo who produced the movie. Personally I think he done a good job with this film even though it made a lose at the box office but I would have liked it to be dubbed.Budget 14million Worldwide Gross 13millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action movies starring Michelle Yeoh WooSung Jung Xueqi Wang Shawn Yue and Kelly Lin. 510".

Last year it was propagandized as a John Woo's work in order to infuse some incentive into this starstudded kungfu film to conquer the local cinemas. Shamefully this trick stumbled quite severely as it was largely overshadowed by DETECTIVE DEE 2010 at the box office with the same release period during Chinese National Day October 2010.Its reviews were generally favored though which should be merited to ChaoBin Su the real man behindthewheel and whose previous director works SILK 2006 and BETTER THAN SEX 2002 have won him some reputation as a gifted and emerging Taiwan director. As a Chinese the fact is that we tend to be immune from domestic Kungfu films much more than foreigners because since our infancy we haven been surrounding and tested by myriad films like these so it is difficult to make a fuss about it unless there is truly something special in it.So speaking of this film in spite of that it has many plot holes which doesn't make sense even in the time of Jiang Hu to name a few our heroine's initial motivation of stealing the half buddha body in the first place the plausibility of facelifting technology the sudden intensifying kungfu mastery of our hero etc. the film converges some genuine talent to entertain its audience especially the dreamlike cinematography successfully builds a ruthless world of Jiang Hu as well as its innovative fighting design which embodies each main character their own personality.The cast is solid for an action film it's the first time since CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON 2000 Michelle Yeoh finally collected a decent leading role as a martial fighter which is welldone too judging by the criterion of acting. I do have high expectation of her to take a leap in the upcoming Aung San Suu Kyi's biopic THE LADY directed by Luc Besson.

Sure there is wonderful over the top action but its the people you'll remember...and they will break your heart repeatedly.I really loved it in part because I loved the people but also because it surprised me. Just when I thought it was winding down it took a new turn and even the ending worked. Its a wonderful film My sole complaint with the filmthings do tie up a tad too neatly but no matter its a wonderful film.";

There are several layers to the storyline and depending on what you want from the movie you will take something different with you when the movie ends. I am not going to summarize the storyline here as it would require too much space and this is the type of movie better seen then read about.Yes this is WireFu at its best but then again so are many of the great swords play and martial arts movie to come from Asia. And whether or not you like the WireFu movie that is a matter of personal preference. I do however enjoy them and I enjoyed this movie quite a lot.I was especially impressed with Michelle Yeoh's performance in this movie. I must admit that so far I have only had a soso relationship to most of her movies as they haven't been as outstanding as this one. But she really dazzled me with this movie and I do believe that I will revisit the older DVD movies with her on the cast list in my DVD collection any time soon.Reign of Assassins is a definite must watch for fans of epic movies such as Hero and the entire genre of these particular types of movies. Reign of Assassins is in all its complexity a very beautiful movie.".

While I don't think it is better than CTHD all these films are essentially different films with different stories and characters so it really depends on what you like in a film  hence I don't believe in the 'greatest film of all time'  it's up to you after all.But I had a good time with this. I have to admit I thought there were too many characters and I got a bit confused as I was trying to keep up with who was who and all but it is essentially a fun story about a group of assassins who are after the main gal Yeoh who wants to lead a normal life instead of one full of constant bloodshed. While this has elements of typical revenge elements the film also has a sense of humour with some comedic moments fantasy romance and great fighting scenes.However I felt the film didn't have a consistent tone so it sort of switched too much for my liking. Was it trying to be a serious film about warriors hardships and their quest to feel human? That's what I thought it was then it sort of changed its tone to melodramatic which sometimes didn't work properly then to cheesy comedy. I think they put a lot into it.Nevertheless all the actors in here give a pretty good performance and Yeoh pulls it off with her physical abilities not to mention her charisma. The ending however felt underdeveloped as I couldn't believe that is how it was with the guy and his attitude that's all I'm saying  it changed very quickly! That being all said it is a well done film and certainly an enjoyable martial arts film that is probably more suited to those who didn't like the elusive emotions in CTHD but I did and hey I don't mind a no brainer flick if it is done well  and this certainly is!".

One of these elements is that of a domestic comedy an entertaining sharp contrast with the thrilling action. Another is the almost schizophrenic alternating between black comedy and affecting romance. There is also a rich array of interesting character roles each with a separate story and it is quite evident that in the final version seen in the cinema some of these have unfortunately been edited away. Let me start from the beginning. Don't go in late at don't blink during the impossibly fast introduction about how two halves of the remains of a top martial artist monk if found and put together will give supreme power here's your dark comedy which later surpassed itself with a fiendish twist. In animation style we are shown a murderous attempt of the Dark Stone assassins gang to snatch one of these halves led by GodFathersounding literally the voice I mean Wheel King Wang Xueqi arguably the best character actor in the Chinese language cinema today and his deadly aids elderly trickconjuring Magician scene stealing Leon Dai cool and flamboyant Lei Bin dashingly handsome Shawn Yue and icily lethal Drizzle beguiling lovely Kelly Lin  complete with flashes of their names in frozen still shots.

Moving further along the monk after showing her four moves in her swordplay that her teacher Wheel King deliberately withheld forfeits his own life in an attempt to persuade her to abandon her sinful life style. Moved Drizzle seeks help whereby she gets surgically achieved a new face and changes her name to Zeng Jing Michelle Yeoh and disappears into oblivion as a street vendor. And this is only the beginning of the story!So we finally see the two leads the other being happygolucky FedEx or whatever equivalent they are called in the movie guy Jiang Ahsheng played by Korean heartthrob Jung Woosung well remembered as The Good in the Korean rendition of The good the bad and the ugly. Briefly the mood changes into one of romcom as the somewhat awkward yet endearing courtship bears fruit followed by the aforementioned domesticity where pinching every penny out of the tight family cum small business budget takes on lifeanddeath proportions. Needless to say the next phase in the plot is the Dark Stone quartet trying to track down the renegade Drizzle. Yes it is still a quartet with replacing Drizzle a young recruit Turquoise Barbie Hsu equally beautiful and lethal and moreover hotly sexy. As Zeng Jing's identity is revealed when she and hubby are caught in a bank robbery yes they have those in ancient China too the situation becomes not unlike Angelina Jolie in Salt a deadly femme fatal trying to protect a vulnerable husband. But then things are not what they seem at least not in this movie. Then there are other characters appearing  remember there is the other half of the remains  minor characters but still played by some of the hot Taiwanese pop stars such as Pace Wu. Enough said. This movie promises two hours of exceptionally fine cinematic enjoyment with such a pageantry of so many different things that it's a marvel that nothing feels out of place. John Woo codirecting with protg Su Chaobin can still work a wonder or two especially when it is with a genre that is quite new to him.".

The plot isn't overly complicated but there are still some nice twists. The action and there is plenty of it is brilliantly choreographed with lots of sword fights. Michelle Yeoh is on great form as postsurgery Drizzle and Woosung Jung provides solid support as Ahsheng. There are also impressive villains most notably Xueqi Wang who plays the leader of the Dark Stone and Barbie Hsu who plays a particularly vicious assassin who had previously killed her husband and his parents on her wedding night!

And it shows. It is a beautiful film visually. The action scenes are lush filled with detail beautifully choreographed and easy to follow. The film is overall very well made from the technical point of view including costuming camerawork et cetera.It also has Michelle Yeoh in the lead role which is always a huge plus in my books. So why the relatively low rating? Well... it's been some weeks after I saw it and I'm honestly struggling to remember the plot at all. Reading the plot summary helped but the details still don't come. Which is strange because the plot actually has some cool ideas and twists. But like with some other John Woo films it honestly feels like the movie is going through motions not really trying. There's no passion to it no real originality aside from its technical quality.Or perhaps I just wasn't in the right mood to see a film that particular evening. Nevertheless it's a movie worth seeing if you've liked Woo's other efforts or you're a fan of Yeoh. Or if you're just a wuxia fan honestly. It's not the best example of the genre you've likely seen but it has enough good things in it to please.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a movie. I saw this movie yesterday and I'm still thinking about it. Tony Leung is just awesome. I had seen him in a few movies I'd already determined that he's a great actor. I have no problem understanding what's going on with him without reading the subtitles because he communicates so much with his eyes. So watching him in this I was curious to see that something else was coming across than you'd normally expect. Here he's playing against type and I thought he did a wonderful job. Definitely Oscar worthy. As is his costar who I kept trying to rack my brain for a film I'd seen her in but apparently she's a newbie. You'd never know it from her performance. It's a true leading performance since she carries most of the film being in just about every minute of it. She's great. And how great was it to see Josie Packard Joan Chen again.  Ang Lee is a genius. He's so good at capturing the emotions of his characters and actors. It's like he unfolds them so that everything on the inside is laid bare. From The Ice Storm to Brokeback Mountain to Lust Caution he shows you real people and how they love and damage and betray each other and more specifically how it feels. That's true talent. Anyone can point a camera. This is something else entirely.The film itself is the best espionage film I've ever seen but that's not all it is. It's very much like a noir and a war film and romance is probably the genre that is represented least. I've read a few reviews mentioning love and falling in it. There is some of that but I think maybe those people might want to give this one another go. They might have missed the point.Who should see this? Adults. But I'm not saying that because of the sex scenes. I'm 33. I don't know if I would have completely grasped the emotional complexity of this film 10 years ago. I think you need to have been kicked around a bit by life to fully appreciate what's happening here. Anyone who likes old movies sad movies good movies. Bogart fans noir fans costume design fans should all enjoy it. I sincerely hope it gets some recognition around Oscar time. It's my favorite this year so far.".

	schema:headline " Drawn out borderline pornographic but...";
	schema:reviewBody "...well worth seeing. I had the pleasure of seeing this film tonight at the Toronto International Film Festival and it was a delightful experience not to mention I was about a foot away from Tony Leung and Ang Lee.So as I have written in the title the film itself may appear to be a bit flawed to most viewers. One of the consensus main complaints was that it was too long and drawn out 157 minutes is no joke especially with a few ice teas in you from dinner. However I believe the story was well paced and needed the full length of the movie to fully develop. There were not many scenes that could have been easily cut out. It was also not nearly as slow as some other films i.e. In the Mood for Love or as long as other films i.e. Once Upon a Time in America. Overall I felt the movie flowed quite naturally and was focused on the storyline although I went into the movie expecting a loose meandering plot line as some other reviews have suggested.Another complaint was that the sex scenes were unnecessarily long prolific graphic and even violent there was a rape scene. Again I disagree with these complaints because I felt like these were the scenes that really brought out the lust in the characters. This was especially true for Tony Leung's character whom many viewers seemed to feel was underdeveloped and one dimensional. As my friend said Tony could have done this role in his sleep. True but that was the whole point of his character. Ang Lee purposely left his character undeveloped for most parts of the movie except those few sex scenes a particular scene in a Japanese whore house and the closing scene. Those were the few scenes that made Leung's character vulnerable and human. Because there were so few windows that allowed the audience to glimpse into his character that made the emotions all the more realistic and powerful. The violence in the rape scene should also be addressed. Again this was one of those rare scenes that shows Leung's character as human although it was a very brutal violent side of him. Here he appeared angry and frustrated and not at Tang Wei's character but really more at himself and what he has turned into. He was portrayed as a traitor in the movie and he never spoke about how he viewed himself except for the scene in the Japanese brothel when Tang's character asked him if he took her there so she could be his whore. He responded that he took her there because he knew much more about whoring oneself than she did obviously referring to his political role as a traitor. Thus through minimal dialogue and character development Ang Lee was able to depict Leung's character with great insight and accuracy all the while reminding us that he was still human on some level.Now although Leung's character development was sacrificed for the benefit of the film Tang's character development was actually enhanced. Make no mistake she was the central character of the movie and it was very interesting to follow her metamorphosis from a young naive university student to a spy for the resistance force in bed with the enemy. Once again Lee revisits his theme of lust and how powerful it can be during her character development and especially the sex scenes. There was a scene after she finished having sex with Leung and goes to report to her superior officers. She then describes to them how she must endure and pretend to love Leung wholeheartedly as a part of her role and how she endures the prolonged sessions of sex only to hope for them to crash in the door and shoot Leung in the back of the head to have his brains and blood splattered all over her body. All in all it was a very notable and powerful acting job on Ms. Tang's behalf and definitely refreshing to see a younger actress take on a serious role like this and really tackling it.There were also some lighthearted moments sprinkled throughout the film which had an excellent score to accompany it. The cinematography costumes scenery etc. were all first rate. The real meat of the film however was within Ang Lee's direction Tang's acting and of course the intense sex scenes that powerfully depicted lust no holds barred with anger frustration hate and all the other negative emotions associated with it. Interestingly enough the only moment in the movie where both Leung and Tang's characters felt a mutual love was not in bed but in the Japanese brothel when Tang performed a song for Leung.All in all this was a delicate and exquisite movie that was carefully planned and filmed with attention to every detail. It offers a profound and in depth examination of lust. I recommend that everyone should experience the movie once regardless of the 2.5 hours length and explicit sex scenes  it was well worth the time.".

He was portrayed as a traitor in the movie and he never spoke about how he viewed himself except for the scene in the Japanese brothel when Tang's character asked him if he took her there so she could be his whore. He responded that he took her there because he knew much more about whoring oneself than she did obviously referring to his political role as a traitor. Thus through minimal dialogue and character development Ang Lee was able to depict Leung's character with great insight and accuracy all the while reminding us that he was still human on some level.Now although Leung's character development was sacrificed for the benefit of the film Tang's character development was actually enhanced. Make no mistake she was the central character of the movie and it was very interesting to follow her metamorphosis from a young naive university student to a spy for the resistance force in bed with the enemy. Once again Lee revisits his theme of lust and how powerful it can be during her character development and especially the sex scenes. There was a scene after she finished having sex with Leung and goes to report to her superior officers. She then describes to them how she must endure and pretend to love Leung wholeheartedly as a part of her role and how she endures the prolonged sessions of sex only to hope for them to crash in the door and shoot Leung in the back of the head to have his brains and blood splattered all over her body. All in all it was a very notable and powerful acting job on Ms. Tang's behalf and definitely refreshing to see a younger actress take on a serious role like this and really tackling it.There were also some lighthearted moments sprinkled throughout the film which had an excellent score to accompany it. The cinematography costumes scenery etc. were all first rate. The real meat of the film however was within Ang Lee's direction Tang's acting and of course the intense sex scenes that powerfully depicted lust no holds barred with anger frustration hate and all the other negative emotions associated with it. Interestingly enough the only moment in the movie where both Leung and Tang's characters felt a mutual love was not in bed but in the Japanese brothel when Tang performed a song for Leung.All in all this was a delicate and exquisite movie that was carefully planned and filmed with attention to every detail. It offers a profound and in depth examination of lust. I recommend that everyone should experience the movie once regardless of the 2.5 hours length and explicit sex scenes  it was well worth the time.";

It will strike debate among cinephiles of its worth.

Lee's slow burn toward these instant classic scenes was like foreplay leading to an explosive climax. Lee's themes of repression and double lives continue in LUST CAUTION.

	schema:reviewBody "Excellent! Excellent! This film really injects the visual meaning of 'caution' throughout the film  at least till close to the finale. There are numerous instances when I was reminded of the film's appropriate title Lust CAUTION! Indeed a remarkable visual achievement that cooks up metaphors to provide so much food for thought.Two characters who are supposed to understand the nature of their duties and responsibilities gradually becoming suckers to their self passions and sentiments not unrealistic for the many who may recall the 1963 Profuma Affair that brought down the Harold MacMillan government in Britain or even the Mark Anthony and Cleopatra tales! In this film the supporting actors play very minor roles in the film. This actually impresses me more to make me consider that a person's downfall oft results from hisher weakness especially in relation to hisher uncontrollable passion and sexual urge. Love is blind... as the saying goes.The film's flashbacks are well crafted to introduce Mr. Yee and Jiazi and to focus on their persistent strong and certainly uptono good determined characteristics before they succumb to their sentimental temptations and passions. The scenes of stylistic elegance of the Colonial Hong Kong being clouded by Japanese Occupation and scenes of Shanghai with its bleak postQing Dynasty signs of chaos together with the expected Second SinoJapanese War terror flow through the film at a good pace. The urban crowded characteristics of these cities with their tenementblocked living marked with social and political upheavals and turmoil and class exploitation are artfully exhibited  the allure and historical trauma of both cities so subtly revealed without overshadowing the performances of Tony Leung and Tang Wei! It was certainly captivating to watch how this film celebrates Hong Kong's urban identity while also mediating its historical relationship with Shanghai. Just like with Mr. Yee and Jiazi perils and pleasures of modern urban life are inescapable for the two cities.Director Ang has also amusingly mixed Chinese sensibilities and Hollywood influences to give Shanghai that dangerously cool and seductively sexy appeal that does help to raise question of the stake this city faces with the presence of Mr. Yee and Jiazi. After all didn't Shanghai become a locus center of vice and degradation  a foil to the virtues of the countryside? Is the audience at the beginning of the film expected to see Mr. Yee and Jiazi as upholders of these opposing modern vs traditional traits and as far as foreign occupation relates the differences East vs. West colonialism? For fans of Zhang Ailing who authored the original story upon which this film is based It's not difficult to relate some of the tragic incidences of the film to Zhang's very tragpersonal life. This film should especially appeal to those familiar with the 1940s history of Hong Kong and Shanghai and to those who had experienced the inner turmoil resulting from having to adapt to changing environments.And I do enjoy seeing this film as an attempt to remind the audience how a couple passionate in romantic love often puts in their best performances and stylistic acts to impress one another as portrayed by Mr. Yee and Jiazi. These love 'sparks' have a tendency not to exist with old married couples as seen in Mr. and Mrs. Yee's love relationship.".

It's kind of rare in my memory. Only summer blockbusters could have this strong performance yet their ratings were not restricted! I didn't worry about my ticket. I already ordered online. Ang Lee do make yourself at home. We all love you. And I love the sex scenes. On bed they use their body languages to show their emotions. Lust and caution are the basic tones the skin and what hidden beneath are hatred anger revenge loneliness redemption and love. I have never seen so many emotions in scenes of sexual intercourse or lovemaking whatever you call them. I felt tense during the sex scenes which are indispensable for the whole dramatic arc. I didn't enjoy the lust part and the caution undercurrent had my heart dangling. If I want to enjoy sex on movie I would just go to watch porn. People who want to go for that very reason be prepared to get disappointed. I was also moved by those young patriotic students. By them Ang Lee tells us he was once like them and still is now sending message to the audience through art through culture and with passion. Ang Lee seems like to make movie with a lot of metaphors. You can see that judging from the movie titles. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is not only an idiom but also meant for the characters and more Brokeback Mountain is a lost paradise as well and Lust Caution for that foreign audience would miss it again by its Chinese title  we realize  is also a pun.  is Caution and the diamond ring Mr. Yee gives to Wang too. The diamond ring when the secretary returns back and says it's yours. No Mr. Yee says it's not mine. I guess it means the diamond ring belongs to Wang. So does his love to her. For the first time I didn't feel a diamond ring is so superficial like in the TV commercials.From some reviews and news I noticed Ang Lee and the crew changed Eileen Chang's assassination scene? If so that is really smart. Anyway I am going to read Eileen Chang's short story. I am always interested in comparing his films and the original stories or movie scripts. No exception. It's kind of Lust Caution intercourse I enjoy between Ang Lee and me.".

The film was a beautifully executed espionage thriller if you want to go with how it's being marketed to a broad audience. Steeped in the historically and culturally turbulent period of the second SinoJapanese War one must applaud Ang Lee for the dizzying array of minutiae he oversaw as director.Because of the nature of the film's protagonist Wang Jiazhi played by a newcomer named Tang Wei  not shabby for your first feature as an agent working under a second identity to ensnare a dangerous collaborationist Tony Leung all the scenes where Wang masquerades as the bourgeois Ms. Mai are fraught with a psychological tension doubling with the political agenda at stake as well as her womanhood. She portrays both roles with heartbreaking deftness a great casting choice if there ever was one. While not as physically alluring as some of her competitors for the role  Chinese language actresses including Zhou Xun and Shu Qi  I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off like Tang. She convincingly transforms herself from a naive college girl to coy seductress...and back again.The film struck quite a few personal nerves on my part too. While mainstream cinema should be you know selfsustaining or whatever you want to call it there's really a lot to this movie that gets lost in subtitling to an extent but also just in context and culture. Etiquette at the mahjongg table the omnipresent yet understated background of wartime occupation political interests in the Chinese Civil War era the weight of regional identity in dialects and interpersonal relationships. Tang Wei spoke Mandarin Cantonese and Shanghainese. My only thought is What a hottie.The sex scenes are...something else. As echoed by most critics they serve the story perfectly in capturing the urgency that Tang and Leung have in their precarious affair. There's a lot of violence in them and it is through these carnal and savage acts that Tony Leung's Mr. Yee character is established as a very dangerous man. I won't spoil too much but there were several times when it became too difficult to watch.There were quite a few moments that made my heart flutter and eyes wobble. I'll just leave it at that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Early in the movie Wong Chia Chi Tang Wei gets asked to act in a patriotic play in a time when China was threatened by the Japanese Invasion during the late 30searly 40s. Little does she know that she's got to carry on acting the rest of her life together with her group of idealistic young dramatists as stage feelings stirred up real emotions that calls for the sacrificial of self for the greater good for the country. What they lack in experience they make up with their youthful passion and exuberance. And their rawness shows in the way they clumsily set up their traps for the coming of the prey and fumbling even with their first blood.Welcome to Lee Ang's world of espionage. It's not glam and gets draped in many real world sense and sensibilities. We enter a world where Trust and Loyalty are difficult to come by and with shadows lurking in every corner waiting to pounce at the slightest of mistakes. But the darkness is beautifully captured and like its endless rounds of mahjong you're waiting for that perfect tile to come your way for the opportune to present itself for the East Wind to come about. That's how this movie's espionage theme is played out with plenty of waiting. Instant results and instant gratification do not come easy and even the finale I found to be less than satisfying though it provided subtle avenues to keep your imagination running as to how the turn of events have greatly affected the usually cautious Mr Yee Tony Leung.Like the movie Leung's Mr Yee remains an enigma we are trying to have a crack at trying to like the rest understand his secret life. He sneaks around from fort to fort always with protection and has this solid wall build around his personal life that even his wife Joan Chen finds hard to break and letting it be anyway enjoying luxurious life as a taitai. All we know about Yee is that he's a Chinese traitor in the employment of the Japanese while enjoying immense power under the protection of his master readily bolts like a running dog that he is in the first signs of trouble.Enter Tang Wei's Chia Chi in a strategy hundreds of years old and that is to use the lure of the beauty to provide the downfall of powerful generals. As a fresh faced ingnue she enters the dangerous cat and mouse game at great personal sacrifice probing cautiously that's the word again into the life of Mr Yee and casting those come hither eyes as bait to lure her prey relying on others to provide the finishing blow and save her from his evil roaming clutches. In order to enter his circle of trust she has to play to the sadistic sexual fantasies you see I don't think he gets any from Mrs Yee anyway of a repressed man using her as an avenue to release those pent up rage and frustrations from work where his job as we know is to interrogate fellow countrymen. It's not a glam job especially when you're casting your lot with the underdogs.Lust Caution is a tale of two lonely people forced by circumstances to do what they have to. One to fulfill her ideology and get rid of possibly one of the most dangerous man to the Chinese while the other looking for honest companionship. It's falling for and sleeping with the enemy both ways and in a time where trust is hard pressed this makes everything more complex especially when it comes to irrational emotions that overrule logic and guard. It's layered with plenty of betrayals whichever way you look at it and the narrative kept pace by unfolding eachlayer intricately. Which makes it ultimately a very sad love that couldn't be story the perennial fib to reality.Tony being Tony I can't help but think that with his hair slicked back and his stoic demeanor in well pressed suits look the more vengeful version of his Mr Chow from In the Mood for Love though this time round he really gets it on with another married woman Mrs Mak Chia Chi's alterego.

She switches between the greenhorn student and one who's living a lie quite easily and she exhibits linguistic skills English Cantonese Mandarin and even Shanghainese and even talent for song. Watch those eyes of hers and her rant during breaking point excellent stuff.Lust Caution is an espionage story that works and being set in a tumultuous era helped loads in the eagerness and sense of urgency required and how patience in getting everything set up for that one shot one kill opportunity makes it a constant tussle both for the characters and how events get played out.".

	onyx:emotionText "Early in the movie Wong Chia Chi Tang Wei gets asked to act in a patriotic play in a time when China was threatened by the Japanese Invasion during the late 30searly 40s. Little does she know that she's got to carry on acting the rest of her life together with her group of idealistic young dramatists as stage feelings stirred up real emotions that calls for the sacrificial of self for the greater good for the country. What they lack in experience they make up with their youthful passion and exuberance. And their rawness shows in the way they clumsily set up their traps for the coming of the prey and fumbling even with their first blood.Welcome to Lee Ang's world of espionage. It's not glam and gets draped in many real world sense and sensibilities. We enter a world where Trust and Loyalty are difficult to come by and with shadows lurking in every corner waiting to pounce at the slightest of mistakes.

Even he has been through several villain characters the devotion and outcome that he put in this role is never been seen before.As for the controversial sex scenes that gather all the spotlights they all take important places in the film just as Lee said.

Sure it seems like a story in a decade but after all they are the flashbacks of the leading female role.This movie definitely goes beyond the achievement of Brokeback Mountain which is already very brilliant. While showing the conflict of sense and sensibility it also pays tribute to a bunch of classics and the master creators which reflect the mind of the roles and are inherited such as Casablanca The Godfather Suspicion Penny Serenade Last Tango in Paris and In the Realm of the Senses.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about a woman enticing a top ranking official in the occupying Japanese government in order to assassinate him.I am very impressed by this film after just watching 5 minutes of it. The mahjong scene is very well made. Behind all the gossip it has so much subtle tension. Everyone is secretly calculating another and planning their next move both in the game and outside the game. Another striking thing that I noticed is that the panning motion of the camera. I am sure it is very tricky to get it right! A continuous shot of taking a piece of mahjong then the hand of tiles then throwing the unwanted one away. All done in one shot. It's really good camera work.There is a lot of complex emotions both expressed and implied. For example Wang Jiazhi's pain of having to give up her virginity is skilfully implied. Later her pain of being intimate with Mr Yee is expressed in a rage. The psychological games in the subsequent parts is well portrayed. Wei Tang is masterful in playing her role. She portrays a wide variety of facial expression and bodily gestures so naturally and skilfully. Her power of seduction is undeniable. The surreal atmosphere that she creates when she is Mai Tai Tai is stunning. I have never heard of her before and I hope she will get to play in more film in the future.Despite the film being two and a half hour long it did not feel like it at all. In fact I am glad that Ang Lee gives us enough time to appreciate the beauty of the film. The plot is gripping and there is a lot to be pondered on. Men have to caution against lust while for women they may have to caution against something else. I will no reveal it here watch the film to see for yourself.This film is a beautiful masterpiece. Just a side note the sexuality in this film is so extremely the polar opposite compared to Ang Lee's last film Brokeback Mountain. I find this very interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Too long too slow too selfindulgent and too brutal in its graphic sex scenes Ang Lee's Lust Caution is a film not to be missed.Whatever misgivings there may be about it this festivalwinning film is a mesmerizing rich experience. After 2 12 hours of being bombarded with a World War II loveandhate story that's both exciting and dragging chances are you will be still pinned to your seat anxious to find out how it ends. The Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain director has turned his attention to warthreatened Hong Kong in 1938 and Japaneseoccupied Shanghai in 1942 complete with a safe Japanese zone seen through the eyes of a group of young Chinese resistance fighters. Based on the late ChineseAmerican writer Eileen Chang's short story of the same name the focus of Se jie is the relationship between Mr. Yee head of the ruthless Japanesecollaborator security forces played by Tony Leung leading man of some 80 films and a young actress with the resistance played by Wei Tang in her very first film role. They make a strange pair both in the roles and as actors. Of the story  a catandmouse game between the seductressunderground agent and the Japanese puppetlord of life and death among the occupied  the less said the better in order to enjoy the movie. As actors it's a veteran facing a new challenge and a novice who shows great skill and assurance. Leung has always been a brooding symphathetic wornbuthandsome presence especially in his collaborations with director Wong Kai War. Here for the first time he plays not just a heavy an ugly character but a scary unhappy murderous man literally a dark figure lurking in the shadows. It's a great performance fully realizing both aspects of the character the monster and the man. Lee's love for the cinema classics is shown both in his use of excerpts from Hollywood greats as the young actress frequents movie theaters and in his creation of memorable images. This is a director with a painterly sensibility and the ability to transform objects into instantly memorable pictures. Never will you see mahjong again without recalling Lust Caution. Few of Lee's favorite classics can match the simple effectiveness of his final image here of a sheet with slight depressions left by what rested on it shortly before white on white and yet meaningful and affecting.Leung and Tang fairly monopolize the screen but the rest of the large cast is outstanding led by San Franciscan Joan Chang as Yee's wife and the vivid individual characters in the resistance including the Americanborn Chinese pop star Leehom Wang.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ang Lee's Lust Caution got a lot of negative reviews in the US. I was shocked. I always thought Lee of all people could convey the nuances of Chinese culture to a Western audience.I admit I love this movie as I do all his work except The Hulk. And I'm not implying you have to give it the thumbsup because it won the Golden Lion. However after reading dozens of reviews from mainstream media in North America I have a strong feeling that most critics failed to understand the movie  not only the subtleties but even some of the plot. Of course the two are often interconnected.Rex Reed of The New York Observer called Mrs Yee silly because he assumed she is oblivious to her husband's trysts with other women. This couldn't be further from the truth. From how she reacts to her husband's emotional breakdown in the last scene it is obvious she is in the know. There are Chinese wives who feign ignorance of their husbands' affairs and this is probably something an American film critic cannot grasp. Shouldn't she be throwing a tantrum? They might ask.Rex continues Neither of the two stars look like they're having much fun. I wonder what movie he was watching. Of course they were not having fun. This is not a romantic comedy. The lady is scheming to kill him and he is figuring out whether she is another beautiful assassin sent his way. They are both walking on razor's edge which is not a fun activity.Most critics call the movie a spy thriller without realizing the multiple layers of the story. It is mostly psychological with the two leads constantly testing each other and using a language rich in undertones. Almost every line has so much texture it could take a few more lines to decipher.Many see a resemblance with films of similar plots such as Paul Verhoeven's Black Book and Hitchcock's Notorious. But they fail to see the link to previous Lee masterpieces such as Sense and Sensibility and Brokeback Mountain. Think of it. Lust is sensibility while caution is sense. Both leads  and even some of the supporting characters  have to maintain a life of caution for selfsurvival. When they succumb to lust or passion they pay the ultimate price.The three sex scenes received such widespread misinterpretation that trimming them might not be the terrible idea it should be. People got so carried away with the SM and acrobatic couplings that they forgot to detect the symbolic meanings. The scenes epitomize their relationship from domination to distortion to harmony. That's something a simple head shot could not convey. And it does not necessarily imply the lady loves to be tortured. That would be the same as saying she is a golddigger who falls for a precious diamond.The definite moment when she falls for him is at the Japanese club when he reveals his weakness. He has a hunch his future as a collaborator is doomed. She has a soft spot not for his power and money but for the latent humanity he finally lays bare. The big stone just confirms his feelings for her in her mind.American critics are quick to pick up the clues of Hollywood movies that appear in the meticulously portrayed old Shanghai and have found an allusion to Hitchcock's Notorious but nobody seems to have noticed that Mr Yee's every move is watched by his secretary who knows his lover's secret identity and will probably bring about his downfall.Human emotions writ large can transcend boundaries. It is the niceties that cause cultural misunderstandings.".

It is mostly psychological with the two leads constantly testing each other and using a language rich in undertones. Almost every line has so much texture it could take a few more lines to decipher.Many see a resemblance with films of similar plots such as Paul Verhoeven's Black Book and Hitchcock's Notorious. But they fail to see the link to previous Lee masterpieces such as Sense and Sensibility and Brokeback Mountain. Think of it. Lust is sensibility while caution is sense. Both leads  and even some of the supporting characters  have to maintain a life of caution for selfsurvival. When they succumb to lust or passion they pay the ultimate price.The three sex scenes received such widespread misinterpretation that trimming them might not be the terrible idea it should be. People got so carried away with the SM and acrobatic couplings that they forgot to detect the symbolic meanings. The scenes epitomize their relationship from domination to distortion to harmony. That's something a simple head shot could not convey. And it does not necessarily imply the lady loves to be tortured. That would be the same as saying she is a golddigger who falls for a precious diamond.The definite moment when she falls for him is at the Japanese club when he reveals his weakness. He has a hunch his future as a collaborator is doomed. She has a soft spot not for his power and money but for the latent humanity he finally lays bare. The big stone just confirms his feelings for her in her mind.American critics are quick to pick up the clues of Hollywood movies that appear in the meticulously portrayed old Shanghai and have found an allusion to Hitchcock's Notorious but nobody seems to have noticed that Mr Yee's every move is watched by his secretary who knows his lover's secret identity and will probably bring about his downfall.Human emotions writ large can transcend boundaries. It is the niceties that cause cultural misunderstandings.";

Both of them are poor and pathetic  Jiazhi was only 23 years old but she suffered such a miserable life that no one can imagine she fell in love with a person that she shouldn't love. Mr. Yee was portraited as a coldblooded person and he in fact is a true human with love. He had to keep himself alive so he helped the Japanese. I am sure he didn't want to He hated Japanese actually!! He loved Jiazhi and bought her a ring as a commitment but soon discovered that his true love is a spy.All characters in this movie were so selfish including those who called themselves as patriots. They all have some kinds of intentions like making revenges. I really hate that guy who burnt Jiazhi's letter he is a LIAR !!Jiazhi devoted herself into the love of Mr. Yee that she chose Yee rather than her first love and let Yee ended her life she could have taken her pill. I don't know if her purpose for letting Yee killed herself is making revenge or putting a tattoo of love in Yee. She had the chance to kill Yee while having sex with him but she didn't and she refused to kiss her first love Kuang. She might not realise her love to Yee but she knew it when receiving the ring from Yee whose eyes are full of love.Yee was a lonely and insecure guy that he hardly could find someone to talk to and finally he found one but the wrong one......Love is so terrible that it makes people doing things that are unpredictable......The movie was great but not perfect  Ang failed to convey the anger of being occupied by the Japanese  He tried to emphasize it but not strong enough. Also the last scene of Mr. Yee escaped from the jewellery shop was so hilarious and was ruining the mood of the movie. Maybe Ang intended to do it to tease at those people who cared about the lives and did stupid and foolish things Ang is a genius in presenting the emotion and feeling of people. His new movie was not that disppointing as the media said. The media was so superficial to focus only on the sex scenes which were not as violent as it reported. The three sex scenes were not weird and I could truly experience the emotional change of Yee and Jiazhi thru them.I've watched almost all movies of Tony Leung  he is my fivestar actor. Wei Tang is a talented actress and I really hope she would be more famous in the international stage.".

I wasn't opposed to seeing it I just didn't have any strong feelings about it one way or the other. Boy oh boy did that change after I stumbled from the theater noticeably dumber. How an exceptional film maker like Lee could make a movie like this with so much potential and fail on so many levels I have no idea but this movie is a meteoric rocket crashing to earth with a dull lifeless thud.Of course my wife again being Chinese loved the movie. Well maybe she didn't love it but she liked it. Its probably not on her top 10 list or anything but she might like to watch it again.Long review short if you're a Chinese woman you might like this film. If you're a discerning movie goer that is critical of what you see and doesn't take anything at face value you very well might hate this film.So how does this movie fail?The problems with the movie are almost unilaterally a reflection on the motivation of its characters. They continually choose to do things and act in ways that are utterly and ridiculously opposite to how a real person might really act in that situation. The group refuses to act out their plan unless their prey makes 3 steps forward. Mak runs screaming down a street like a child when the group succeeds in the murder of a target. Mak falls in love with Yee while he treats her like trash property and an object. Mak progresses from just standard female stupidity into fullblown sexist stereotype when she sells out not only herself but the entire group for the gift of... wait for it... a diamond ring! Was this movie bought and paid for by Zales?? Oh here's a big diamond THIS proves my love for you not when I was smacking you around a while back...Its weird but the movie works better as a cautionary tale for women and their notorious materialism  Watch out ladies if you think a diamond is the same thing as love you might find yourself getting shot in the back of the head in a ditch  than it does as a drama or suspenseful film. Of course there's no need to sit through almost three hours of beautiful garbage to get that point across. Even the heavily publicized lovemaking scenes were difficult to enjoy. Wei has a beautiful body but the way she accepts being treated like a punching bagsextoy is just uncomfortable to watch and never sensual or erotic as it is meant to appear. If you enjoy those lovemaking scenes you've probably also considered tying up a woman in your basement. And really her accepting that treatment makes sense from the perspective of a spy trying to kill Yee falling in love makes ZERO sense.Which is of course the final straw that broke the camel's back of realism. The fumbling inanity of this group of rebels fits better in the 3 stooges than in a serious dramasuspense. The silly requirements they put on themselves for killing Yee are laughable and CLEARLY represent an effort by the writers to extend the story. None of their reasoning or efforts make any sense. Why must Yee step inside the house on the dark deserted street with no one for miles around before they kill him? Why must Yee be at a perfect spot in the jeweler's store and have been there for X minutes and have everyone be given the Go to kill him before killing him? Why can't Mak smuggle in a gun or a knife or some poison or a ligature or SOMETHING into their numerous lovemaking sessions to kill him with? Its all done in the service of extending the story and if one thinks about it as the writers are hoping you will not the whole story falls apart.The ending brings us welcome release  FINALLY those incompetent fools that wasted three hours of our life are dead and we can stumble back to our cars. Save yourself! If you're doing it for the nudity just rent a porno! If you're doing it for a wife... well... sorry to hear that. Grin and bear it I guess.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lust Caution fails largely because of its sex scenes. However this isn't a comment on how graphic they are. Many films with graphic sexual content have succeeded as fine examples of the cinematic art  Cronenberg's Crash Polanski's Bitter Moon and Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris to name but a few. Instead Lust Caution fails because its sex scenes don't have conviction. They don't feel organic. They feel contrived. It's like Ang Lee has been thumbing the Kama Sutra and wants to fill his film with as many sexual positions as he can. This alone this sexual variety is meant to convey the characters' passion. But it's a sorry substitute for chemistry between actors or great writing.To make matters worse the twist at the end the scene where the heroine Chia Chi sells out her country and her friends hinges on her love for this traitor she's been sleeping with. Now if you really felt that they were in love or if their lust was incendiary you could maybe believe the heroine's actions but instead I sat there wanting to hit myself in the face. This girl is an idiot. She has a bit of sex and her beau gives her the ugliest ring known to humanity and suddenly she's lost all sense. I wanted to slap her. I wanted her resistance pals to blow her brains out. She sells everyone out for a bit of sex.And its not even good sex. The sex scenes are about as exciting as a Power Point presentation by Al Gore about climate change. We're just meant to accept that these characters are passionate because we get a brief glimpse of testes and because we see the traitor Mr Yee huffin' and a puffin' between Chia Chi's wide open legs. But I refuse to believe that there is anything going on under the surface. I refuse to believe in any underlying emotions  they're just not there. And anyway in the first major sex scene the girl is manhandled and then later she confesses that Mr Yee isn't sexually satisfied until she's bleeding. So not only does he screw her with blank emotionless eyes but he's abusive as well. Wow it's the love story of the century.However even though the sex scenes are cold and passionless for a while I did think that they might have served a useful purpose. I wanted to believe in the idea that Mr Yee knew that Chia Chi was a resistance operative and that she planned to kill him. This might have given the relationship more meaning than one of twisted love. But instead in the end with Mr Yee mournfully sitting on Chia Chi's bed after she's executed it's revealed that the relationship was as simple as it seemed. Two people got a bit of the horn and maybe thought they loved one another. Two and a half hours of film so that I can watch some silly tart betray everyone because some bastard gives her a few orgasms.But all the talk of sex is missing the fact that there's not actually that much sexual content. This is more of a thriller than a grumble flick. And as a thriller it works pretty well. There's one great scene where a young theatre troupe turned resistance cell kill their informer. It's incredibly clumsy and brutal. It actually kind of reminded me of the scene in Hitchcock's Torn Curtain where a communist is beaten remorselessly and just won't die. This scene has the same kind of desperation. It also has the same kind of lack of glory. All the time in the movies we're shown how easy it is to kill and how wonderful it is slay someone 'evil'. But there's no glory here. The murder is nasty and grubby.It also marks the point where the actors enter the real world. Before you kind of feel like they're playing at being a resistance cell. But now they're finally playing with the big boys. And it also shows how empty their patriotic plays are. They talk of China never falling and one of the characters wants to avenge his brother's death but for all their highminded ideas they're really just murderers. Yes they're doing it for their country but they finally realise that taking a human life is a difficult thing.Another setpiece that is well filmed is the one where Chia Chi is meant to have Mr Yee executed. With resistance operatives looming in doorways and hanging out of windows Lee builds the tension superbly. It's just a shame that Chia Chi decides to spare her worthless lover. A great piece of cinema all of a sudden had me wanting to slap the bald head of the man sitting in front of me in the theatre. Here's a character who really is worthy of death. Here's a man who is torturing and killing Chia Chi's countrymen but because he knows how to use his penis Chia Chi allows him to continue inflicting his suffering on her people.But speaking of knowing how to use one's penis there was a scene that really made me laugh. When Chia Chi begins trying to woo Mr Yee we find out that she's a virgin. Therefore she needs to learn how to have sex. Cue some amusing awkward sexual encounters with one of her friends. At first the guy does most of the work but later she's on top of him taking care of business. He then says something like 'You're finally getting the hang of it'. Chia Chi's reaction is to tell him to shut up. I liked that a lot.But the same can't be said for the film as a whole. It had a lot of potential but in the end it's a shallow experience. There's less than meets the eye.".

Yes they're doing it for their country but they finally realise that taking a human life is a difficult thing.Another setpiece that is well filmed is the one where Chia Chi is meant to have Mr Yee executed. With resistance operatives looming in doorways and hanging out of windows Lee builds the tension superbly. It's just a shame that Chia Chi decides to spare her worthless lover. A great piece of cinema all of a sudden had me wanting to slap the bald head of the man sitting in front of me in the theatre. Here's a character who really is worthy of death. Here's a man who is torturing and killing Chia Chi's countrymen but because he knows how to use his penis Chia Chi allows him to continue inflicting his suffering on her people.But speaking of knowing how to use one's penis there was a scene that really made me laugh. When Chia Chi begins trying to woo Mr Yee we find out that she's a virgin. Therefore she needs to learn how to have sex. Cue some amusing awkward sexual encounters with one of her friends. At first the guy does most of the work but later she's on top of him taking care of business. He then says something like 'You're finally getting the hang of it'. Chia Chi's reaction is to tell him to shut up. I liked that a lot.But the same can't be said for the film as a whole. It had a lot of potential but in the end it's a shallow experience. There's less than meets the eye.";

	schema:reviewBody "I can't think of a more prevalent example of misguided trailers then Ang Lee's new piece Lust Caution. I was anticipating a tale of romance and seduction between an older man and his mistress within Japanese occupied China. Wow was that not even close. True those aspects are there but the real story is so much more involved stimulating and unexpected.After following his last Chinese language film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with two English language works it is nice to see Lee go back to his native tongue. I enjoyed both Hulk and Brokeback Mountain for what they were but neither touched his martial arts epic in terms of scope or success. When hearing about Lust Caution I was very much excited to see what he would do with it. Looking more like a Wong Kar Wai movie not sure I have the credibility to make that statement seeing as I've only seen the gorgeous In the Mood For Love I was hoping to get a sense of the character pieces he had done early in his career that I have not yet been able to view.If there is one thing that stays consistent through the works I have seen it is his wonderful use of cinematography. With cameraman Rodrigo Prieto a man who has filmed works by favorites of mine Irritu and Cuarn behind the lens one could not expect less. After working with Lee on Brokeback Mountain he once again shoots some stunning work. The framing is always perfect many scenes use mirrors and glass to keep all the action on screen simultaneously and the sexual encounters are displayed with the right amount of care and brutality necessary to get the point across on what is happening. This is one sticking point that has been gaining a lot of press around the movie. Does it deserve the NC17 rating here in the US? Maybe. Nothing is more graphic than say HBO's new series Tell Me You Love Me yet it is more integral to the story. Many of the instances are pretty much rape and that is something one should know going into it in case it will deter your wanting to view the movie. However the overall impact of what happens would not be even close to what it is had those moments been excised or edited. The sex between our two leads is the bond that connects them beyond the jobs they are doing. That physicality is what makes the final third of the film as heartbreaking as it is.As I said before though Lust Caution is not about the love affair been characters played by the great Tony Leung and startling newcomer Wei Tang. What we really have set before us is a tale of revolution espionage and maturing within the confines of a world at war. Tang is just a kid who finds herself the new star actress at her school. The theatre troupe she works with decides that they should do what they can for the resistance which they are unable to fight in. After its director played nicely by LeeHom Wang has a chance encounter with an old friend the troupe gets to the cusp of a dangerous situation. They soon find themselves way over their heads trying to orchestrate an assassination of a Chinese man working with the Japanese as a traitor to his country. When the event that shows the culmination of their age and inexperience plays out it is both unexpected and unavoidable. Either way though they have embedded themselves into the guerilla war and eventually find that they had no chance to turn back. Meeting four years previous to the film's conclusion at the back of their college theatre sealed their futures.While at its core we are given a story very similar to last year's foreign sensation of espionage The Lives of Others it is shown very differently. Lee allows the story breathing room to ferment and go its course. Each spy grows up so much during the four year span of the film. Between the main two Tang and Wang along with Leung's traitorous political general the evolution of each is shown in its entirety. All three's motivations are clearly laid out and during the almost three hour runtime the audience cannot become lost because they are shown absolutely everything. So rather than build extreme tension between two people like in the German film Lee allows for a slow construction of backstory and relationship with all involved. All our principals grow together or apart based on what they allow themselves to do for the good of their nation. No matter how good the story itself the film would be nothing without its magnificent acting. It is Tang and Leung that carry the movie. With so many moments of silent expression between them and some tough to stomach scenes in bed these two amaze. The emotions are always prevalent and the decisions they make never stray from character. Yes their relationship is unconventional but the bond they forge cannot be taken lightly. While the middle portion might seem a bit long and monotonous to a point the finale is a feat of genius. From Tang and Wang's final look into each other's eyes and Leung's reaction to the clock's strike of ten all you can think is how Lee let this story be told as it should. So I guess while I chided the industry for their almost suicidal handling of foreign films I do need to give them some credit for still letting us Americans who don't mind reading subtitles view them in their unedited glory. Well at least some times if this was a no name director and not Lee I wouldn't have been surprised if the producers changed the ending and shaved an hour off.".

It took me a few days to finally get over the depressed state of mind I was in. To me Wong was a shell before she became Mak Tai Tai. She needed to be in that role for her own mental survival. Only by acting could she find her way to her own identity. I'm still not 100 convinced that it was love between these two. To me it's two very lonely and repressed souls making a human connection. The explicit sex scenes were necessary. The sex acts portrayed their need to feel each other's own individual's existence by torturing or be tortured physically. The orgasms Wong experienced were not joyful. It was a fulfillment of finally letting herself feel what she real felt and shared it with another human being. It's the same with Mr. Yee. He was finally able to find someone that he could let his guards down and release all his fears and guilt. Does the Quail Egg play a big part in Wong's decision to let Yee go? Absolutely! I'm a female and I tried to understand her mental state at the time. It was never about the value but the meaning behind the value. She was nobody. Now she is at least worth that Quail Egg to somebody even if that somebody is her enemy. Women are strange creatures. I would've done the same thing if I were in her position. At the end she scarified herself and the whole entire compatriots to attain that moment of truth for herself.I love this movie. I love Brokeback Mountain too but I really get this movie. I watched every film made by Ang Lee except Ride with the Devil because the DVD I rented was damaged. Ice Storm was simply brilliant. I thought it deserved an Oscar consideration. His films always left me unsatisfied and challenged my mental endurance every time. Although his films were never in the same genre everyone has a common theme  repressed souls reaching out for human connection. Lust Caution is a sad depressed draining movie. If you like to see it be prepared to have patience and concentration. In this film if you pay attention nothing is trivial!".

Lee establishes Wang as a cool girl in the expository sequences by use of apathetic expression actually a nonexpression under freeze staging. Down the plot Wang apparently remains tough and firm in her mission as revealed from her dialogues. Nevertheless Lee portrays Wang's evolutionary attitude toward Mr. Yee Tony Leung essentially by use of the 3 sex sequences in which Wang behaviorally shifts from being passive to active. As a mirrored portray Mr. Yee's calmness and seriousness as well is seen alleviated by his disclosure of his job to Wang in the last hour of the story. Lee in practice builds up a subtle slowpaced escalation of passion and psychological mutation of both leads culminating to the diegetic climax.The carefully choreographed overt sex sequences in a whole are instrumental in portraying the evolution of subdued passiveness of Wang toward her target. The sequences witness Wang's gradual sentimental change from taking up a hunting job in fulfillment of her patriotic duty to the nation to an ever deepening voluntary enchantment with her target. Lee goes further from his Brokeback Mountain to enhance the degree of explicitness by bringing the leads' bodypubic hairs Wang's underarm hairs in a closeup in particular into miseenscene to connote the rawness and liberation of the couple's desires.With the acts of excruciation and execution of spies brought off screen Lee keeps violence to the minimum despite the blood shedding sequence in the Hong Kong apartment in an earlier plot. There is a slight change of cinematographic style in the film fast cutting and swish pans at the beginning slow cutting static camera and occasional tracking from the middle to the epilogue. While both leads exercise caution along their ways in concealing their respective motives rationality is consciously and unconsciously marooned by lust the desire for love and sentiments which eventually render betrayal and fiasco.

If this film doesn't make Hollywood draft Tony Leung ASAP then nothing will. I want to see him in an American film. I have been waiting ever since Happy Together. I was sure we would see him after In the Mood for Love I was sure some American director would immediately use him. He will certainly take the Golden Horse  Hong Kong awards next year. The question is will Hollywood have the smarts to nominate him. A fabulous actor! Ang Lee is just superb at his craft. How soon can we have another film from him? The details in every scene will require repeated viewings. It was great to see Joan Chen  the new young actors. A wonderful assembly of young talent. Ang Lee always seems to get the best out of actorsin every film.".

If this film doesn't make Hollywood draft Tony Leung ASAP then nothing will. I want to see him in an American film. I have been waiting ever since Happy Together. I was sure we would see him after In the Mood for Love I was sure some American director would immediately use him. He will certainly take the Golden Horse  Hong Kong awards next year. The question is will Hollywood have the smarts to nominate him. A fabulous actor! Ang Lee is just superb at his craft. How soon can we have another film from him? The details in every scene will require repeated viewings. It was great to see Joan Chen  the new young actors. A wonderful assembly of young talent. Ang Lee always seems to get the best out of actorsin every film.";

The whole story was a relatively simple one and not confusing. Comedy rarely gets this good from a silly point of view. Dialog is real good and listen to the constant jokes which are genuinely funny! Anyone slating this would do well to remember it is a comedy! Meant to be a farce!

Keaton is great in this he filmed this the same year he was filming the first Batman movie. Also a very fine performance by Dennis Boutsikaris as the kindly illfated doctor. My mother and I were always surprised when we saw him in movies afterward he seemingly has not played anything but aholes and arrogant lawyers since. This seems to be the one and only halfway likable character he's played. You have to admit if mental hospitals were this accommodating and peaceful in real life being insane wouldn't be such a bad gig.  I almost wanted to have myself committed by the end of this. That's perhaps not the glowing recommendation of this film that I mean it to be.... It's like if Lloyd's other looney bin movie One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest had a happy ending. A gentle harmless film to sit back and relax with. Watch for the cute yet slightly eerie reference to the World Trade Center. Another good New York crime comedy to watch back to back with this is Quick Change starring Bill Murray Geena Davis and Randy Quaid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some films that have been forgotten about and left in the past are interesting to me because they can be surprisingly entertaining and thought provoking. The Dream Team is such a film and is one of the great sleeper hits of the late 1980's.A remake of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest The Dream Team is about four mental patients who have been institutionalised for different reasons.Billy Caulfield Michael Keaton is a compulsive liar with a violent temper. Despite his inability to control himself at times he does have a firmer grip on reality than the other members of his group.Henry Sikorsky Christopher Lloyd is a neatness freak with delusions of being a doctor. He prefers to focus on the problems of others rather than confront his own concerning his estrangement from his wife and daughter.Jack McDermott Peter Boyle is a former advertising executive with a Messiah complex. He likes to believe he is Jesus Christ so he can elevate himself above his own personal failings.Albert Ianuzzi Stephen Furst is a couch potato obsessed with baseball and has been catatonic for much of his life. Although he is the most withdrawn member of the group he is aware of what is going on around him. He just doesn't choose to participate.This disparate group of people seem to have nothing in common on the surface but their therapist Dr Weitzman Dennis Boutsikaris likes to believe they are not too far gone to reclaim their own identities.He wants to bring them into the outside world for a field trip to Yankee Stadium for a baseball game. They are understandably nervous about being out in the real world again but are willing to give it a try.Unfortunately Dr Weitzman is mugged by two crooked cops on the way and our heroes have to fend for themselves.The Dream Team is both funny and touching as they have difficulty coping with how much the world has changed while they've been in hospital. The four of them have to learn to cooperate with each other to save Dr Weitzman from the cops.Michael Keaton gets a lot of the best lines as he can be funny disturbed and troubled all at the same time. His livewire performance is perfectly attuned to the manic energy he brings to the character.Christopher Lloyd is hysterical as he picks up every piece of litter off of the streets of New York. The scene where he goes to see his wife and daughter for the first time is my favourite part and is very touching when he discovers he hasn't lost them.Peter Boyle gets a lot of funny scenes especially when he starts preaching at a Black church and when he goes back to the advertising agency Wa wa wa wa.Stephen Furst doesn't get to say much but he does play an important part because he is the only one who witnessed what happened to Dr Weitzman. He just can't communicate properly what happened.It's nice to see how they gradually begin to reclaim parts of their identities as they focus together for the common goal. They draw strength from each other and begin the slow process of rebuilding parts of their sanity again.The ending is quite satisfying because although they are not cured they have gone a long way towards becoming useful members of society again. Its a pity they never made a sequel because it would have been interesting to see more of their recovery. The four actors have got such a great chemistry and Dr Weitzman is a likable character because of his faith in them that they may be released one day.Look out for an early appearance from Lorraine Bracco best known as my favourite character Dr Melfi in the Sopranos. She makes quite an impression as Billy's feisty exgirlfriend Riley. Another example of how forgotten films can contain hidden surprises.Definitely one of my favourite films.".

There is not much to the plot mainly because it focuses on the characters both individuality and as a group.This is an excellent comedy and in my opinion should be on the list for best comedy film. If you have not seen it you are missing out!";

Albert takes off but he can't tell the others what happened. After waiting in the van for a while they all leave for parts unknown.

It does pick up however and the acting is superb all around. Keaton is great  one wonders what happened to his career and why we don't see his lively presence as much in films nowadays. Lloyd manages to be so serious that it's funny but also has a poignant scene with his family. Boyle has the funniest role and he's absolutely hilarious. The ending is very sweet.The movie doesn't make any profound comments on mental disorders but does ask who's crazy in this world and what we're willing to believe about certain people. It also makes the point that by interaction and someone caring disturbed people can start on the road to healing. Very good and well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was probably too soon for Spencer Tracy to have tried a remake of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Ten years was not long enough for people to forget Fredric March's Oscar winning performance from the Paramount classic of 1931. This version of the Robert Louis Stevenson horror novel drew for Tracy some of the few bad reviews he ever got as a player because it was too soon. Time has been good to this film and we can see the differences in interpretation.The Jekyll character that Tracy creates is a soft spoken guy a lot like Father Flannagan. He's a medical doctor more interested in research than in a practice. Before Sigmund Freud ever coined the terms ego and id to describe man's duel nature of good and evil Stevenson had those same notions about man's behavior and incorporated them in his novel.The Hyde character was a bold experiment. Tracy was probably the player in Hollywood who disliked makeup the most. Yet for this film and for few others he allowed himself to be made up ever so slightly to suggest the evil Hyde. It was a far cry from the simian appearance of Fredric March's Hyde and Tracy got criticized for it. Retrospectives now are kinder to him and his method of interpretation.Stepping into the female roles played by Rose Hobart and Miriam Hopkins in the March version are Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman. Lana Turner although later she played quite a few sexpots was at this stage of her career playing very winsome proper young ladies and not doing a bad job of it.Ingrid Bergman plays Champagne Ivy probably one of the most luckless characters in fiction. Ivy was not in the original novel she was in the play that was adapted from the Stevenson novel and she's come down to us ever since. This poor girl no better than she ought to be meets Tracy as Jekyll and he's attracted but engaged to Turner. When he becomes Hyde the beast within him remembers and stalks Bergman mercilessly ending in tragedy all around.Besides March and Tracy other actors who've tried this most difficult of parts are John Barrymore Jack Palance and Kirk Douglas. Only the best can and are willing to tackle Jekyll and Hyde. And there ain't no doubt that Tracy is one of the best.".

Time has been good to this film and we can see the differences in interpretation.The Jekyll character that Tracy creates is a soft spoken guy a lot like Father Flannagan. He's a medical doctor more interested in research than in a practice. Before Sigmund Freud ever coined the terms ego and id to describe man's duel nature of good and evil Stevenson had those same notions about man's behavior and incorporated them in his novel.The Hyde character was a bold experiment. Tracy was probably the player in Hollywood who disliked makeup the most. Yet for this film and for few others he allowed himself to be made up ever so slightly to suggest the evil Hyde. It was a far cry from the simian appearance of Fredric March's Hyde and Tracy got criticized for it. Retrospectives now are kinder to him and his method of interpretation.Stepping into the female roles played by Rose Hobart and Miriam Hopkins in the March version are Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman. Lana Turner although later she played quite a few sexpots was at this stage of her career playing very winsome proper young ladies and not doing a bad job of it.Ingrid Bergman plays Champagne Ivy probably one of the most luckless characters in fiction. Ivy was not in the original novel she was in the play that was adapted from the Stevenson novel and she's come down to us ever since. This poor girl no better than she ought to be meets Tracy as Jekyll and he's attracted but engaged to Turner. When he becomes Hyde the beast within him remembers and stalks Bergman mercilessly ending in tragedy all around.Besides March and Tracy other actors who've tried this most difficult of parts are John Barrymore Jack Palance and Kirk Douglas. Only the best can and are willing to tackle Jekyll and Hyde. And there ain't no doubt that Tracy is one of the best.";

The screenplay of the later film was literally based on that of the earlier and there are scenebyscene and in places wordforword duplications. Both are excellent with my own preference going to the 1941 and Spencer Tracy. His performance is amazing and so subtle that it's frequently dismissed as inferior work. To the contrary it's every bit worthy of an early graduate of the Actors Studio. Spoilers follow.The highlight of the film is the astonishing scene when Jekyll first changes involuntarily into Hyde. He's walking the sidewalk in the fog whistling a Strauss waltz he earlier danced with his fiance played well in a throwaway role by Lana Turner. Without meaning to his whistling changes to the polka sung by barmaid Ingrid Bergman whose performance is nearly a match to Tracy's. He stops a confused look on his face then walks on whistling the waltz. Again it changes to the polka and he stops again wiping his brow confusion again on his face. Now unsure he starts to walk again and can only whistle the first notes of the polka. He stumbles to a park bench and changes into Hyde. Hyde looks about and then hurries over to the barmaid's flat where as Jekyll he's just told her Hyde will never come again. Ivy is celebrating with champagne. In a brilliant mirrorshot we see her look of horror as the door opens and Hyde enters. The rest of the scene is simply unforgettable between the deranged Hyde and the terrified Ivy realizing her fate is at hand.There are nice directorial touches in both films and both tell the story very well. Many will prefer the more straightforward showier 1931 version. For myself the 1941 is supreme with Tracy delivering one of the alltime great screen acting performances. 910.".

In one of her first U.S. films she delivers a brilliant performance as Ivy Peterson the Cockney barmaid unwillingly cought up in Hyde's insane reign of terror.

	schema:reviewBody "It is impossible to watch this movie without comparing it to Reuben Mamoulian's 1931 Paramount version. I prefer the earlier version but this one does have certain advantages.When Mamoulian's movie was made sound movies were barely four years old  and it shows. It wasn't simply a question of technology. The aesthetics of sound films were different the structure of the story the rhythm of scenes the use of closeups etc. had all changed. Mamoulian's film is very accomplished but is still on the cusp of this change and Fleming's film is undoubtedly a smoother more confident piece of filmmaking. Similarly Tracy gives a genuine movie performance. Frederic March may have won an Oscar but his Jeckyll has the declamatory style of the theatre so characteristic of very early sound films.However it also has disadvantages. In 1931 the censor had less power than in 1941. Mamoulian was able to overrule many of his objections. He still had to be fairly discreet but he could be somewhat more explicit than Fleming about Jeckyll's sexual frustration.More importantly instead of going to the book for inspiration MGM simply remade Mamoulian's movie  scene by scene. As a result it inevitably feels a bit stale in comparison. This was also a missed opportunity because whatever its merits and they are many Mamoulian's film had not really solved the problem of how to tell this story. Fleming simply reproduces its shortcomings.The book is basically a mystery. A lawyer encounters the loathsome Mr Hyde and learns of his connections with Jeckyll. Various other strange events occur. After Hyde commits a savage and unprovoked murder the lawyer starts to investigate. Meanwhile Jeckyll deposits a letter with him that must not be read until his death or disappearance. Eventually the lawyer tracks Hyde down to Jeckyll's laboratory where he is found dead. This takes up 9 of the 10 chapters of the book. He reads the letter which explains the mystery.Both movies dispense with the mystery and go straight to the letter. What makes Jeckyll's confession so compelling is how it documents his gradual slide into 'addiction'. Initially Hyde is a means by which he can indulge in his vices without shame remorse or consequences. But each time he does so Hyde gets stronger and his behaviour gets worse. Eventually Jeckyll loses control altogether and Hyde can appear of his own accord. In despair he commits suicide.The core of the book therefore is Jeckyll's first person narrative. The cinema is no good at the first person and both these movies tell Jeckyll's story from the normal third person perspective. But Jeckyll has no one he can talk to about his experiences so we lose most of his motivation and much of his growing anguish. This movie implies that his initial experiment was motivated by a desire to heal but we are given no reason why he continues to take the transforming drug and see little of his power struggle with Hyde. We see the initial transformation during which nothing happens as in the book then on the second transformation we get a long scene with Hyde in the bar and an even longer one of him terrorising and brutalising Ivy separated by a short scene of Beatrix with her father. As a result Jeckyll disappears from the movie for 25 minutes  Hyde has taken over the story.When Jeckyll does turn up again Hyde's actions have become so appalling that we no longer understand Jeckyll's position. Does he know what Hyde has been doing? In the book he does but in this movie we are not sure. If he knows then he is a callous hypocritical monster who is as bad as Hyde. But if he doesn't why does he take the drug at all? Both movies shy away from a crucial feature of the story. Jeckyll enjoys being Hyde! Without this realisation the story may seem to be fairly simple and clearcut but it actually makes no sense.I doubt if there is any way to tell this story effectively without a voiceover narration. Jeckyll has to tell the audience directly what he is thinking and feeling. In 1931 the voiceover was probably not even technically possible. By simply copying this movie Fleming misses a crucial opportunity to improve on it.I would make one final observation. In this version Hyde's makeup is much more subtle than in Mamoulian's film but neither is really satisfactory. Mamoulian's simian throwback could barely pass as human but in this movie there is no way that Ivy could fail to recognise that Jeckyll and Hyde are one and the same.Both movies are trapped in a convention that probably goes back to the very first stage productions and was reinforced by Barrymore's bravura transformation scene in the 1920 movie traditionally one actor plays both parts. There is no warrant for this in the book. Hyde is very different from Jeckyll and is actually much smaller especially in the beginning. This convention was not challenged until Hammer in the Sixties but I feel that both of these movies would have worked better if a second actor had played Hyde. The lead actors would then have been spared the agony March and the embarrassment Tracy of that Hyde makeup.".

Yes the word dull came to mind. But after seeing the superb 1941 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde I found myself wondering if anyone could have played Dr. Jekyll and especially Mr. Hyde any better than him.In the 1931s original a handsome wimpy Dr. Jekyll transforms into an ugly retarded Mr. Hyde. While this Mr. Hyde hardly resembles his alter ego Jekyll except for neediness I do not find that as a strong interesting controversy in the film. Fredric March was a great actor but in this film with this script different actors could have played the parts of Jekyll and Hyde and it wouldn't have made any difference. Awkward still boring film.I was expecting so much but stopped taping this pretty soon into the film. The psychology is awful I am not suggesting that all films should emulate real life but all films should be real in a world of their own whatever it is. I had seen the 1941s version earlier and boy it doesn't have a dull moment. I started watching this for Lana Turner and there she is looking pretty. Yes she should have played the part Ingrid Bergman took but you can't have it all all the time. Perhaps Ingrid Bergman was the girl to play the waitress. I truly enjoyed her masochistic portrayal of the bad girl.Yes the film owns a lot to the original  filmed on same location same choreography? The makers of this film had a decade to learn from the mistakes of the original and turn it around with better lines and nuances.With one look from Spencer Tracy a trouble maker changes his mind. I'm sorry governor. Imagine Fredric March in his monkey make up doing that? He would have been laughed out the club or not get in at all.To add the grade to 10 Peter Godfrey as the butler. The end of this film is truly spiritual merciful and frightening at the same time. And all of this is accomplished without any phony art stuff as they would have tried these days.A true classic.".

Folks in that part of London at that time bar maids WERE prostitutes.I find any moster more scary with no facial hair or deformities added.  This Mr Hyde could well exist in real life.  In fact he DOES exist in real life. Once in a while we manage to prove it and put him in prison.".

He scared me to death when he vaulted over a railing and down a couple fo flights of stairs.This is more of a thriller than a horror movie and done long before it became fashionable to throw tons of money and bigname performers at horror classics in order to produce blockbusters that were once just silly.This supposedly cleanedup version has Hyde asking Ingrid Bergman if she likes him because he's a little bit Jeckyll or Jeckyll because he's a little bit Hyde.So many people are fussing that this movie turns the prostitute into a bar maid.  Folks in that part of London at that time bar maids WERE prostitutes.I find any moster more scary with no facial hair or deformities added.  This Mr Hyde could well exist in real life.  In fact he DOES exist in real life. Once in a while we manage to prove it and put him in prison.";

	schema:reviewBody "This version of the classic Dr. Jekyll  Mr. Hyde story is more slowmoving and psychological than most.  Rather than emphasizing the more horrific elements of the story it relies on a good cast to bring out the ways that the characters and their relationships are affected by the doctor's weird experiment.  It's not the version to watch if you are looking for excitement or horror but as a more psychological approach it mostly works.Spencer Tracy plays the dual leading role and does pretty well at creating two distinct personalities  the transformation uses only minimal special effects and relies on Tracy to make the characters convincing.  Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman work well as Beatrix and Ivy and the rest of the cast members are also all very good.  What the film lacks in excitement it makes up for in making Dr. Jekyll's world believable.If you're already familiar with the story in its more horrific versions this would be worth a look if you're interested in a different take on it. It's probably not the place to start though if you don't yet know the story.".

As Dr. Jekyll he is a caring and understanding doctor but when turning into Hyde we see a performance unlike any Mr. Tracy has played before. Hyde is all evil totally delighted by being menacing with no regard to anyone else. For this reason I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good thriller without the gore. The rest of the cast is excellent especially Ingrid Bergman as Ivy who is the subject of Hyde's sick amusement. This is a chilling movie made in black and white which seems to add to the suspense.".

When he discusses his research at a dinner party his ideas are met with a great deal of consternation especially on the part of his fianc's father Sir Charles Emery Donald Crisp. In fact Sir Charles is so concerned that he decides to take his daughter Beatrix Emery Lana Turner with him out of the country in order to separate the two and give him some time to think about whether the wedding should go forward or not. In the meantime Dr. Jekyll has grown frustrated with the progress of his research and decides to administer his experimental concoction on himself. Suddenly he turns from a charming and considerate person into a malevolent being called Mr. Hyde. To make matters worse with Beatrix gone he sets his sadistic sights on a young barmaid named Ivy Peterson Ingrid Bergman to satisfy his brutal and abusive nature. Now rather than detailing the entire plot I will just say that the director Victor Fleming does an excellent job of capturing the dark and gloomy ambiance that this movie depends upon. And while both Lana Turner and Ingrid Bergman turn in very good performances it is Spencer Tracy who really makes this film so successful. Definitely recommended for fans of classic horror.".

The theme seems to be sexual repression with Hyde coming from Jekyll's repressed lust.  As Hyde takes over we witness some extraordinary and very graphic Freudian imagery such as Bergman and Turner naked pulling a chariot containing Tracy and his whip and Bergman being screwed out of a bottle by a corkscrew!  Amazing.  But the horror of the story is never realized and there is too much philosophical chat.Tracy is terrific in the lead but his makeup for Hyde is too subtle to be effective.  The transformations require him to stand completely still which makes them a bit dull.  The final transformation is quite an achievement however.  Bergman could have been great but her attempt at a cockney accent seriously detracts from her fine emotional interpretation.  Lana Turner is awful as Tracy's true love.  But the rest of the cast is very strong  especially Donald Crisp.The film also contains some fine Fleming touches including his beautiful slow pans over magnificent sets and crowd scenes.  The cinematography is excellent  make sure you don't watch the colorised version  and foggy Victorian London is recreated stunningly. This film never rises to the horror of the 1920 or the 1932 versions but still has much to offer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen many Spencer Tracy films but he isn't one of my favorites. He was rarely convincing. Couldn't buy him as Portuguese in Captain's Courageous less convincing in Tortilla Flat as a MexicanAmerican too old for his role in Bad Day at Black Rock and not believable as a Cuban in The Old Man and the Sea. He was better in comedies like Libeled Lady and Adam's Rib but where he really shined was as doctors. He plays opposite Hedy Lamarr in I Take This Woman a not very good film but with a fine and believable performance by Tracy as the doctor in love with her. His finest performance however is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a film often unfavorably compared to the '31 film. Frederick March is on par with Tracy as an actor. He too overplayed but Tracy could reach a higher level when he was in top form and there is no better example of this than the two Jekyll and Hyde. Part of the problem with the '31 directed by Rouben Mamoulian was the concept for Hyde a hairy Simian type beast. March does the best he can with that mouthful of teeth but his Hyde is too much a monster and less human than the Tracy. This is where the '41 directed by Victor Fleming excels. March overplayed Hyde and his Jekyll had many corny moments. What Tracy brought to Jekyll was believability as someone in the medical profession someone who even before transforming himself somehow conveys a perverse longing to visit the dark side.March never scares me like Tracy. What Tracy brings to Hyde is subtle and insidious. Remarkably evil. You can see it in his eyes in his smile in how he uses his voice like a snake constricting around Ivy. Tracy's scenes with Ingrid Bergman are uncomfortable to watch because of the hideous way he plays with her sense of wellbeing. These same scenes were in the March version but don't create the same pathos. Miriam Hopkins was a fine actress and she did very well opposite March but she's no Bergman. Neither was the character Ivy in the early film as well conceived. Hopkins' Ivy is a somewhat unhappy tart and her tease of Jekyll at the beginning where we see her swing her leg back and forth is more a conniving entrapment than Bergman's playful Ivy. The 1941 version is far more emotional because of Bergman's Ivy. Her Ivy may be a tart but Bergman convinces us she's got a sweet inner core deep within. When she is terrorized and murdered by Hyde it's hard to take. The girl Hyde destroys in the '41 has a steeper fall from grace and her end is more pitiable. The scene where Ivy comes to visit Dr. Jekyll and shows him the wounds inflicted on her back by Hyde has more resonance than the earlier film. This is not because of Hopkins who is on a par with Bergman in that scene but because March lays it on thick. Tracy's guilt is more palpable and we want to believe him when he tells Bergman's Ivy that she will never see Hyde again. When Hyde does return to Ivy his appearance is all the more hurtful for we like Ivy wanted to believe Jekyll. I do prefer the '31 gas lit London and its enclosed more claustrophobic rickety streets but the fog enshrouded London of the '41 is suitably moody and depressing. Years ago I saw a screening of the '41 with a friend who was put off by how depressing it was. Yes this is true. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a very dark depressing story. Hyde kills Ivy he kills his fianc's father and he actually kills Jekyll as well. He's a vicious brute that brings calamity wherever he goes. I've seen both films many times but the '41 is the one that continues to pull emotion. This is due to Tracy and Bergman as well as Fleming's direction. Mamoulian was a great director but Fleming was his equal. The score by Franz Waxman is beautifully tragic something missing from the '31. In the earlier we have Bach's Toccata and Fugue as a segue to the famous POV sequence reveal of Dr. Jekyll. The Waxman score works in the song Can You See Me Dance the Polka and it becomes a taunt for Hyde to invade Ivy's soul. Champagne Ivy in the '31 doesn't have the same gaiety. The '41 has some laughable symbolism during the first transformation of Jekyll riding a carriage and whipping his horses which become Bergman and Lana Turner the fianc. This stands out as a bad decision by the screen writers. Fortunately that sort of thing is not repeated. The '31 has more of it. There's the statue of the angel embracing a woman that we see as Hyde kills Ivy the cat attacking the bird when Jekyll is overwhelmed by Hyde in the park and the boiling cauldron at the end. These are just as heavyhanded. The park scene in the '41 is improved by Jekyll's whistling suddenly becoming Ivy's song the suggestion Hyde is taking over. Much better.The '31 is lauded for it's transformation scenes but the makeup is obvious particularly the painted nostrils and the use of filters to reveal the makeup. Tracy depends more on his performance. He brings believability to both Jekyll and Hyde. There have been many versions of this story and I've seen most but the Tracy remains my favorite. It's main drawback is it's similarity to the '31 but in just about every case the '41 has more impact. If you haven't seen the '31 see the '41 first then go back and see the older. You'll see how much subtlety gets lost.".

	schema:reviewBody "What do you get when you cross Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with MGM gloss? Spencer Tracy Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner in this boisterous notsosubtle Freudianladen adaptation of Robert Lewis Stevenson's tale of the good and bad in all of us. To begin with I'll admit this doesn't have the perhaps intelligent and thoughtful means about it than its predecessor does. This film more or less tells the story in a straight forward fashion but is more showy and somewhat superficial without centering too much on the serious disturbing aspects of Dr. Jekyll's actions. And they don't have Spencer undergoing such a physical change as Fredric March did. Having said that I think this version is much better in that all the elements come together to make a better package. It has an almost reverent affection for its subject matter and is more emotional in terms of characters and how they relate to each other especially Ingrid as Ivy and Spencer. This adaptation is a little longer than the original and seems to take its time with its characters and excels in bringing the viewer there to the time and place and being in the moment you might say. And to watch Ingrid Bergman act is worth the price of admission alone. She originally was to be play Lana's role and Lana was to be Ivy but Ingrid felt there was more meat to Ivy's character and asked for the change and obviously got it boy was she right. But it is a bit hard to take his cruel treatment of her. It seems like Tracy's Hyde is just plain mean evil and sadistic. Then there's Lana Turner who's given a throwaway role with not much to do but what she does most men will be watching on the edge of their seats for. And then there's dependable character actor Donald Crisp as her father and Ian Hunter as Jekyll's friend. If you want MGM's grade A treatment splashed all over literature brought to life on the silver screen then this is for you. Tracy and Bergman at their best and Lana never looking better.".

	schema:headline " Undermined by the Code Enhanced by Bergman...";
	schema:reviewBody "An adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde wasn't particularly necessary after the 1931 version but just as the Fredric March version brought new elements over the 1920 silent classic with John Barrymore there could have been something fresh to make out of the 'old' material. The subject would have been even more relevant in the worldwide context of 1941. Unfortunately the film only retreads the same formula and fails to pass as a superior version mostly because of the prevailing Hays Code. Don't get me wrong it is a good film in its own right and it's served by solid acting and confident directing but the good parts were either as good in the 1931 version or better. Although he looks more middleaged than young Spencer Tracy delivers a fine performance as Dr. Jekyll he's an ambitious stubborn man who doesn't hesitate to confront a suspicious and unfriendly crowd when exposing some politically incorrect ideas about the natural duplicity of the human soul. And while he's a great Jekyll Tracy can't explore the evil richness of Hyde as March was allowed to. I don't think it's a comment on his acting abilities since Tracy is the epitome of versatility but something must have been too limiting in that directing from Fleming. Mamoulian who did the 1931 film was a Russian so he could inject some bold creativity and he did... but Fleming was too conventional if we except the one scene where I thought I was watching a Hitchcock movie. There's perhaps one stroke of genius that elevates the film slightly above its predecessor. During the transformation scene a hallucination shows Jekyll whipping two horses whose faces are slowly transposed to the two women Lana Turner who plays Beatrix the eyecandy society lady and Ingrid Bergman who plays hellforsoul prostitute Ivy Pearson. Apart from that one blow at the Code the film might have been too 'good' for its own good.Tracy could then only venture his character in the realm of emotional volatility rather than that bestial lust that made March so domineering. In the dinner scene there's a lady referring to that new chap named Oscar Wilde. I don't think that was incongruous among Wilde's famous quotations the best way to resist temptation is to yield to it.. The JekyllHyde story has always been built on two chapters Jekyll resisting the temptation and Hyde's dark indulgences. But there's nothing in that Jekyll that seems ever exposed to the temptations even when he first meets Ivy Tracy plays it like a father figure and Bergman's heart is broken. We see love more than lust.And it doesn't get better with Hyde the 1931 one had the face of a prehistoric man incarnating our hidden impulses Hyde here is evil all right but the very point of Hyde is to be more than a villain here he looks like some bum escaped from an asylum a rabid dog ready to bite out of despair but not like some individual driven by something repressed for years.Maybe it's Lana Turner as Beatrix who failed to inspire Tracy too voluptuous and sweet but in the 1931 film you could feel the sexual tension between Rose Hobart and March and a similar tension between Jekyll and Ivy played by Myriam Hopkins.I guess the code is to be blamed because while it does expose battle between the forces of good and evil in human soul the line that Jekyll has to cross is never drawn in clear terms. There were even moments where it was hard to tell if he was Jekyll turning into Hyde or the opposite and even harder to believe his friend and colleague and best friend Lanyon Ian Hunter didn't know it was Jekyll. Still for all these flaws the film has one asset and not the least her name is Ingrid Bergman. I read that it was her performance in Intermezzo that won her the part for Casablanca I'm pretty confident that this film achieved to convince the producers she was good on an Oscar level proving to have some gift when it came to play long suffering women. There was something in her performance as the poor illfated Ivy that almost stole the thunder of Jekyll and Hyde and avoided her typecast as 'nice women' she embodied the trauma of women who're pleasant enough to appeal to respectable men but can only attract sleazy thugs like Hyde. She was a real tragic character and indirectly the redeeming factor of the film. I didn't feel scared by Hyde as much as I felt sorry for Ivy. And the way she went from childish joy to sheer terror when the shadow of Hyde begun to creep was perhaps the most painful to watch moment. Yes she was that good. And she was so good that according to Katharine Hepburn Spencer Tracy wanted Bergman to play the dual role and I thought that was an interest twist on the story how about the duplicity of women as well as men. Lana Turner didn't add nothing to the film without ruining it though so it's sad that Fleming didn't follow that advice who knows maybe the film's reputation would have been enhanced? It's still worth to watch for the atmosphere the performances of the two leads but this is one movie where the context is crucial to understand where it succeeded and where it failed. Fortunately there's still the 1931 version and it is the definite one.".

	schema:headline " The Best Large Screen Version of DR. JECKYLL AND MR. HYDE?";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1931 version of DR. JECKYLL AND MR. HYDE was directed by Rouben Mamoulian and it starred Fredric March in the dual title role. It won the star the Best Actor Oscar the only time that award was won for a horror film role or a science fiction part. Mamoulian experimented at the start and in one key sequence with the I am a camera technique wherein the viewer was treated like he was seeing things from the perspective of the character of Jeckyll. Jeckyll himself was supposed to look like an early form of prehistoric man  nearly an ape. It's still a good performance but many feel it is too stylized.Ten years later MGM decided to do the property again this time with Spencer Tracy. Tracy actually decided to follow a more classical approach to the role. He eschewed the makeup that March and in the silent film John Barrymore used for the evil Hyde and used a combination of facial contortions and lighting to change his appearance from the good doctor to his evil counterpart.One would like to say that it works. It worked pretty well in 1888 for Richard Mansfield in his celebrated stage performance. But Mansfield could play with the theater lighting to create the physical change on stage. It was an amazing stage effect. It can't be done as well on film or at least in a 1941 film  computerization might help today. Tracy's grimacing face does not look much different from his serious good natured face for the Doctor. Even with the lights concentrating on his eyes it still doesn't look that different.The result is that the audience has to make a logical jump and say that there was a physical change in order to accept the story line. Otherwise everyone would say that Jeckyll and Hyde is the same guy in the movie.Fortunately Tracy's acting allows us to make such a logical jump. He was a terrific actor and he certainly uses a subtlety in his evil that is unnerving. Except for his Arnold Boult in EDWARD MY SON he never portrayed as evil a character.The best scene to catch Tracy's Hyde at it's best is when he is visiting his mistress Ivy. She had been hoping he would not come but she was drinking when he arrives  to steady her nerves. No wonder  Hyde is like a cat toying with a mouse as he plays with Ivy. He plays the piano and keeps discounting various things that he and Ivy could do if they leave the apartment as she would hope  if they are in public she has a better chance for help. But he keeps finding reasons not to do things so that in his opinion it is better for them to stay at home. And even at home they have limited options. You could read to me Hyde sweetly says But we do not have the book! A later scene where he surprises a sleeping Lana Turner on a park bench leering at her is also unnerving. You never see Tracy like that in other films.Bergman's Ivy is to be compared with Miriam Hopkins in the earlier film. Both realize that Dr. Jeckyll is sexually interested in them and both secretly hope to catch him not realizing that he has caught them in his bad personality. But Hopkins always seemed prepared to act like a prostitute in the 1931 film she readily shows off her leg for March's Jeckyll. But Bergman is more tragic in a way. She has a job as a bar maid that she is serious about Hopkins was more of an entertainer. Bergman's Ivy is friendly but seemingly careful and unfortunately she falls under the gaze of an unscrupulous man.Interestingly in the 1931 film Hopkins was singing a version of an actual tune called Champaign Charlie is my name changing it to Champaign Ivy is my name. She sings it happily at first but when March demands her singing it she sings it haltingly and frightened. Bergman sings a jaunty number Do you want to dance the polka? at the bar but is forced to sing it as Hopkins did the other song in a broken version for Tracy. Interestingly enough when Michael Caine appeared in 1988 in a two part television film about Jack the Ripper the music in a scene involving three of the Ripper's prostitute victims used Do you want to dance the polka? as background music and I believe it was not a 19th song at all but composed for the 1941 film.Rose Hobart played the role of General Carew's daughter Jeckyll's respectable fianc in the 1931 film. There was nothing especially interesting about her except she was pretty so she did not do much in that film. But Lana Turner was was a rising star and her part got built up a bit with some scenes alone with Tracy. She also appears in a sexual fantasy sequence as one of a pair of horses with Bergman that Tracy is riding. And there is that leering sequence where Tracy as Hyde frightens her. Turner did nicely in the role although Bergman's part was more interesting.The supporting parts are equally good with Donald Crisp as the doomed father of Turner Aubrey Smith as the righteous Bishop Manners who is thrown momentarily by a noisy Barton MacLane in his congregation jeering at the Bishop's homilies about Christian goodness and MacLane himself in the brief sequence as the insane man with no compunction about doing evil.I like Tracy's version  on most points it is better acted than the 1931 version. But March's makeup no matter how strange it looks still is more acceptable than Tracy's dependence on light and shadows.".

She had been hoping he would not come but she was drinking when he arrives  to steady her nerves. No wonder  Hyde is like a cat toying with a mouse as he plays with Ivy. He plays the piano and keeps discounting various things that he and Ivy could do if they leave the apartment as she would hope  if they are in public she has a better chance for help. But he keeps finding reasons not to do things so that in his opinion it is better for them to stay at home. And even at home they have limited options. You could read to me Hyde sweetly says But we do not have the book! A later scene where he surprises a sleeping Lana Turner on a park bench leering at her is also unnerving. You never see Tracy like that in other films.Bergman's Ivy is to be compared with Miriam Hopkins in the earlier film. Both realize that Dr. Jeckyll is sexually interested in them and both secretly hope to catch him not realizing that he has caught them in his bad personality. But Hopkins always seemed prepared to act like a prostitute in the 1931 film she readily shows off her leg for March's Jeckyll. But Bergman is more tragic in a way. She has a job as a bar maid that she is serious about Hopkins was more of an entertainer. Bergman's Ivy is friendly but seemingly careful and unfortunately she falls under the gaze of an unscrupulous man.Interestingly in the 1931 film Hopkins was singing a version of an actual tune called Champaign Charlie is my name changing it to Champaign Ivy is my name. She sings it happily at first but when March demands her singing it she sings it haltingly and frightened. Bergman sings a jaunty number Do you want to dance the polka? at the bar but is forced to sing it as Hopkins did the other song in a broken version for Tracy. Interestingly enough when Michael Caine appeared in 1988 in a two part television film about Jack the Ripper the music in a scene involving three of the Ripper's prostitute victims used Do you want to dance the polka? as background music and I believe it was not a 19th song at all but composed for the 1941 film.Rose Hobart played the role of General Carew's daughter Jeckyll's respectable fianc in the 1931 film. There was nothing especially interesting about her except she was pretty so she did not do much in that film. But Lana Turner was was a rising star and her part got built up a bit with some scenes alone with Tracy. She also appears in a sexual fantasy sequence as one of a pair of horses with Bergman that Tracy is riding. And there is that leering sequence where Tracy as Hyde frightens her. Turner did nicely in the role although Bergman's part was more interesting.The supporting parts are equally good with Donald Crisp as the doomed father of Turner Aubrey Smith as the righteous Bishop Manners who is thrown momentarily by a noisy Barton MacLane in his congregation jeering at the Bishop's homilies about Christian goodness and MacLane himself in the brief sequence as the insane man with no compunction about doing evil.I like Tracy's version  on most points it is better acted than the 1931 version. But March's makeup no matter how strange it looks still is more acceptable than Tracy's dependence on light and shadows.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was the third version of the oft filmed Robert Louis Stevenson story of a man's battle with his good and evil personalities. Although I consider the Fredric March version filmed ten years earlier to be better this is nonetheless an entertaining film. Spencer Tracy takes on the title roles in this version with Ingrid Bergman playing the tragic barmaid not prostitute Ivy Peterson and both are great in their roles. Dr Jekyll Tracy is a successful high society doctor who is engaged to Beatrix Emery the very young and very beautiful Lana Turner whose father Sir Charles Donald Crisp is skeptical of Jekyll's trying to prove that man's soul has two sides...one good and one evil and thus places doubts on his daughter's future happiness. One night while returning home with his friend Dr. Lanyon Ian Hunter they come upon barmaid Ivy Peterson Bergman who is being beaten by an unruly  patron. Jekyll comes to her aid and takes her home. Ivy is immediately attracted to the suave and debonair Jekyll and tries to seduce him. Jekyll repels her advances but secretly harbors a desire for her. Meanwhile Sir Charles having become disillusioned with Jekyll's theories takes Beatrix on a trip to the continent. Jekyll becomes distraught and buries himself in his work. One night he decides to try a formula he has created to separate good and evil personalities on himself. What emerges is a grotesque and brutal personality whom he names Mr. Hyde. Hyde immediately remembers the alluring Ivy and seeks her out. He literally takes over her life and sets her up in a classy apartment and keeps her there for his own purposes. He brutalizes her to the point the she fears his every appearance. When Sir Charles and Beatrix return from their trip Sir Charles agrees to an early marriage feeling that Jekyll has finally come to his senses. Jekyll then vows not to become Mr. Hyde again. But unfortunately he makes an uncontrolled transformation on the street after having assured Ivy that Hyde would no longer bother her when she came to see him earlier. Naturally Hyde goes straight to Ivy's apartment and confronts her on what she had said about him to Jekyll. She tries to escape but to no avail. Jekyll realizes that now he can no longer control Mr. Hyde and goes to Beatrix to break their engagement with tragic results. Tracy's makeup is far less monstrous than that created for Fredric March ten years earlier. Director Victor Fleming goes for exaggerations of Tracy's features and the playing up of the psychological differences between Jekyll and Hyde. The first couple of transformations are played as dream sequences involving good girl Turner and bad girl Bergman. We don't see the actual transformation until well on into the movie. Of note is the fact that although the story is set in late 19th century London most of the cast speak without British accents. As talented as Ingrid Bergman was her Cockney barmaid accent is laughable. Also Jekyll's charitable work with the poor is barely mentioned in this version. In addition to the above principals look for Barton MacLane as man gone mad Sara Allgood as his distraught wife a clean shaven C. Aubrey Smith as a bishop and former silent movie comic Billy Bevan as Mr. Weller a lamplighter. Tracy and Bergman make this an enjoyable movie.".

Hustle is a great filmnoir. The story is politically incorrect and all the characters are sordid. Burt Reynolds is great in the role of a tormented but correct and efficient cop capable of simulate evidencesliving with the dilemma that his girlfriend is a whore and expecting one day to move to Rome with her. Catherine Deneuve is in the splendor of her beauty in the role of a prostitute. Paul Winfield plays a correct detective but brutal and racist. Eddie Albert is in the role of a powerful man capable of killing to reach his objectives. Gloria's mother is an unfaithful wife and Marty is a paranoid and obsessed man. The appearance of the precinct is very real and authentic. Robert Freddy Kruger Englund in the beginning of his career has a short but important participation in the end of the story as the holdup man in a store. In my opinion this film is very underrated in IMDb User Rating. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Crime e Paixo Crime and Passion".

Hustle is a great filmnoir. The story is politically incorrect and all the characters are sordid. Burt Reynolds is great in the role of a tormented but correct and efficient cop capable of simulate evidencesliving with the dilemma that his girlfriend is a whore and expecting one day to move to Rome with her. Catherine Deneuve is in the splendor of her beauty in the role of a prostitute. Paul Winfield plays a correct detective but brutal and racist. Eddie Albert is in the role of a powerful man capable of killing to reach his objectives. Gloria's mother is an unfaithful wife and Marty is a paranoid and obsessed man. The appearance of the precinct is very real and authentic. Robert Freddy Kruger Englund in the beginning of his career has a short but important participation in the end of the story as the holdup man in a store. In my opinion this film is very underrated in IMDb User Rating. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Crime e Paixo Crime and Passion";

	schema:reviewBody "'Hustle' is an overlooked film though it is easy to see why.Stylistically it is very lowkey with no notable flourishes or tricksiness. It boasts little in the way of 'action'. A hostage situation sequence seems to have been added purely to provide something in that line for fidgety Burt fans. It is profoundly cynical and resolutely almost excessively downbeat. But it is also very thoughtful atmospheric well acted and absorbing. A kind of modern dress companion piece to 'Chinatown'. And whilst not quite achieving the force and subtlety of that film it remains highly creditable.Reynolds is effective as the world weary cop in love with a French prostitute a cipher whom Deneuve turns into a real person. Her character represents some sort of unattainable glamorous continental dream to the policeman. This idea is explored and reinforced by numerous references and allusions to European cinema culture and locale.Burt looks uncannily like a youthful Brando and brings great restraint to a role which could have been horribly overplayed. Ben Johnson Eileen Brennan and Paul Winfield also all give good performances as beaten screwedup people. The outstanding turn though comes from Edward Albert as Leo Sellers a wealthy and powerful businessman with dubious tastes and connections. This character is key to Steve Shagan's screenplay in the same way that John Huston's Noah Cross was to Robert Towne's 'Chinatown'. A persona symbolic of corruption and degeneracy but also integral to the prosperity of the society he is such a part of. Sellers is a refined intelligent man with a keen eye for people's weak spots and fingers deft enough to push all of their buttons at once. Mr. Albert brings him to life with a palpable evil.'Hustle' is a film that I like to reacquaint myself with from time to time. Whilst Shagan's script is occasionally a tad overblown and too fruity for its own good there are some great lines and moments. For me it's noirish exploration of thwarted romanticism is pretty much irresistible.A minor classic.".

His wife is seeing someone else and he's in love with Nicole lovely Catherine Deneuve a prostitute. His job as cop entails endless frustrations not only with criminals but also with victim relatives two of whom are Marty Hollinger Ben Johnson and Marty's wife Paula Eileen Brennan whose daughter was found dead on the beach. And the case is Phil's to investigate.Some viewers will object to the film's admittedly slow pace. And the film does have a problem but I don't think it's the pace. I think the problem here is that the script doesn't give us enough reason to care about Phil Gaines and his life as a cop. That he dates a prostitute does not help. There's also insufficient backstory about him. Except for his love life we really don't get to know him very well certainly not well enough to foreshadow the film's implausible double climax.Perhaps the script's biggest flaw however is its lack of focus. Too much screen time is given to the Marty Hollinger character and his silly efforts to solve the case of his daughter's death on his own. Whose story is this Phil Gaines' or Marty Hollinger's?But Hustle is not a bad movie really it isn't. The casting and acting are fine. I thought Eileen Brennan especially gave a memorable performance. The film's production design is good. And color cinematography is terrific. I really liked those outdoor scenes on the deck where Phil and Nicole chat about life and love with Yesterday When I Was Young playing in the background. Such scenes convey a melancholy nostalgic mood consistent with Phil's midlife crisis.Although the screenplay is flawed Hustle is still worth watching at least once for the underlying character study of a cop in midlife crisis for the fine acting and for the film's excellent cinematography and production values.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having collaborated on The Longest Yard director Robert Aldrich cast Burt Reynolds and Eddie Albert again in the enigmatic Hustle. Reynolds plays LA cop Phil Gaines. He and his wife have basically no relationship so Phil lives with call girl Nicole Britton Catherine Deneuve. When a young woman gets found dead on the beach one day Phil and his colleague Louis Belgrave Paul Winfield get hired to investigate. They conclude that she died of a selfinduced drug overdose. But they don't tell her parents Ben Johnson and Eileen Brennan that there were massive amounts of semen in all three orifices of the woman's body and that the woman was a stripper in a nightclub. The father is convinced that this was not a suicide and is determined to investigate on his own if necessary.I have to say that the movie has a rather convoluted plot the number of characters  and the question of each character's relationship to each other  makes the whole thing hard to follow at times. As it is following the revelation of the body at the beginning the movie sort of throws Phil into the story from right out of the blue. It seems that mostly the movie functions as a look at the underbelly of 1970s LA including a hostage situation in one scene. And if all else fails there's always something sexy for Catherine Deneuve to do namely the part about what Switzerland has. A surprise appearance  although they do credit him  is Ernest Borgnine as Phil and Louis's superior he's the only character who seems as if he's about to have a seizure or something.Overall I think that the movie is seeing if only once. While it is true that the movie progresses pretty slowly I actually would assert that that adds some realism not every detectiveaction story has to be a series of explosions and mayhem.All in all a worthwhile movie. BTW did you notice who the hold up man at the end is? It's Freddy Krueger himself Robert Englund. And I wonder if David Spielberg is related to Steven Spielberg.Sammy Davis Jr. hugging Nixon...".

True to form in Hustle Reynolds' cynical detective takes some savage swipes at American society.  Best line  Can't you smell the bananas?  We're living in fcking Guatemala.  With colour televisions.

Hustle is a nice little film though  a fairly predictable TV cop movie plot lifted well above the ordinary by some intelligent wellwritten dialogue and a nice worldweary performance by Burt Reynolds honest!.Around the same time the director also made Ulzana's Raid and Twilight's Last Gleaming both of which are deeply critical of the Establishment. True to form in Hustle Reynolds' cynical detective takes some savage swipes at American society.  Best line  Can't you smell the bananas?  We're living in fcking Guatemala.  With colour televisions.  The screenwriter also wrote Save The Tiger  with a very similar moral.Well worth watching on latenight telly  NOT worth watching for Catherine Deneuve who's remarkably wooden in English.";

	schema:reviewBody "The elements of this film do not work. It is one of those movies like The Counselor or Righteous Kill that has a fine cast of talented actors and hands them an unworkable script. For Catherine Deneuve the solution is simple. She should not be in this movie at all. She makes no sense as an upscale LA prostitute. Faye Dunaway or Catherine Bach who is in the movie could have played this part far more convincingly. It doesn't matter though because Deneuve's character shouldn't be in the movie anyway. Her scenes as a cop's love interest are so boring and pointless... they make the movie very hard to get through. Burt Reynolds is fine as a depressed alcoholic cop. His character pretty much does acts believably drinking hanging around bars solving crimes when he can. It's not believable that he also runs around with Catherine Deneuve and goes to see French films with her or that the filmmakers could have thought that we wanted to watch several long conversations between the two. Storywise the characters talk about a young dead woman in vile ways and it makes for very sleazy viewing as does her father's roaming strip clubs trying to prove that she was murdered. The sleazy parts about the young dead girl jar badly with the pseudointellectual nonsense of the boring ReynoldsDeneuve scenes. The movie tries to have heart for it's absurd romantic plot line and has none for the portrayal of the victim and her parents where it would actually make more sense. I'd always been told that George C. Scot's HARDCORE was a really sleazy movie. I saw it though and I thought it had a lot of heart and an intelligent script. HUSTLE by contrast fails at showing heart and almost collapses under its own sleaziness. Almost because what really collapses this film is dull romance between a realistic alcoholic burnout and a magical fairy lady from Narnia.".

It's as if they are afraid of what will happen if they do.To sum it up Gains is called in to investigate the body of a young girl found dead on a beach. It is ruled a suicide but the girl's parents mainly her father refuse to believe it. The father played by actor Ben Johnson is seeking revenge and Gains wants to be one step ahead of him. To me the standout in this film is actor Eddie Albert who I've always had a crush on. This is probably the creepiest role he ever played. He's a lawyer with mob connections and won't let anyone stand in his way. He is also a client of Deneuve's character and grins eartoear when talking about the dead girl and the pleasure he and friends got from her. We're talking HUGE creep factor here. In one scene he refers to the girl by saying She could get milk out of a crowbar. Don't think I need to explain THAT line. This film is the typical 1970's cop film with lounge jazz music playing over a car scene. Pretty tame by today's standards but did earn an Rrating. There is reference to a porno film that is supposed to feature Albert's character Leo Sellersagain pushing that creep factor up!. Hustle is probably one of Burt's more forgettable films but it is fun to see him take to a role so seriously after seeing him in Smokey and his other action films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Aldrich's 1975 film Hustle is a melancholy reading of its era's confusions of a time when restrictive norms and values are loosening but it's not yet clear what they'll be replaced with. Burt Reynolds' protagonist police Phil Gaines affects the necessarily hardbitten manner while persistently musing of escape into old movies and songs and expectations and into his memories of the brief time he spent in Rome he's modern enough to sustain a relationship with a highclass prostitute Catherine Deneuve inherently shimmering with resonances of multiple elsewheres but not to avoid agonizing about it. The main plot follows a young woman who turns up dead on a beach it's ruled a suicide but her agonized father Ben Johnson obsesses with piercing and punishing the hedonistic society she moved in an impossible task given its connections and protections and the lack of any direct culpability. The film is heavy with the contradictions of its period it's suffused in casual racism and homophobia and sexism the only major female character who isn't a sex worker the dead girl's quiet unremarkable mother is saddled late on with a personal history that the film holds out as the reason for the daughter's selfdestructive life choices and its aspirations to morose complexity often register just as much as artistic indecision or weariness. Reynolds' customary reserve inhibits the sense of his character's morality and there's often a sense that Aldrich was too overawed by Deneuve to do more than stare at her. In the end the film swerves into moral tennis Gaines hits a lob through his duties for the sake of his own calculation of fairness and receives a return punishment in short order in senselessly random manner. These narrative moves don't really serve the film's highest ambitions but then that's part of the point that unless you're a finesuited somebody the shortterm demands of the hustle will always push those ambitions into compromise or surrender.".

The film is heavy with the contradictions of its period it's suffused in casual racism and homophobia and sexism the only major female character who isn't a sex worker the dead girl's quiet unremarkable mother is saddled late on with a personal history that the film holds out as the reason for the daughter's selfdestructive life choices and its aspirations to morose complexity often register just as much as artistic indecision or weariness. Reynolds' customary reserve inhibits the sense of his character's morality and there's often a sense that Aldrich was too overawed by Deneuve to do more than stare at her. In the end the film swerves into moral tennis Gaines hits a lob through his duties for the sake of his own calculation of fairness and receives a return punishment in short order in senselessly random manner. These narrative moves don't really serve the film's highest ambitions but then that's part of the point that unless you're a finesuited somebody the shortterm demands of the hustle will always push those ambitions into compromise or surrender.";

With the camera in his face he falls backwards off the top of the balcony of a hotel firing his gun into the lens. The continuous shot of him falling and firing is in slowmotion and mesmerising.It was years later that I saw a tribute to David Estridge and his career and it showed how they made the stunt. He was attached to the building with a long piece of wire which was strapped to one ankle. The backward fall was the about 50ft 200ft up the building and Estridge had to act to camera at the same time. All done in one take if it wasn't for the fact that this movie was a real throwaway Reynolds potboiler Estridge would have got more recognition for his job.Seeing the film now if you look carefully you can see the harness on Estridges ankle. A brave man indeed.".

This film affected me so much that as I did not have a copy of it I actually advertised in a newspaper for it and someone forwarded a dubbed copy to me!The excellent acting of Joan Goodfellow Billie and JanMichael Vincent Buster made watching this film a great experience. Their belief in the love of these two characters is reflected in their acting reactions and the little moments that these characters share. I have to admit that I have seen the film many times but it is never a boring or predictable experience even though one has knowledge of how it ends.While this film has been described as cliched and a film with only a desparate appeal to oversexed teenagers this is simply not true. It tells a good story beautifully with great acting and period atmosphere. If only the films of the 1990s and the 2000s could be like this.".

Beg barrow or steal it and watch it as I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.I recommend seeing this movie in one sitting because it is a movie that slowly builds your feelings for the characters which will impact you more at the end of the movie.Buster Lane JanMichael Vincent is a typical country boy with maybe a little more scruples then the average southern country poke.  Buster is engaged to be married to Margie Pamela Sue Martin in the upcoming June and he has been playing touchy feely with her but she wants to wait until they're married to have intercourse. Buster's main friend is Whitey Robert EnglundFreddy Krueger and they hangout and drink beers together and take a trip to the ocean and we get an idea where Buster's friends minds and morals are at and this suffices as the story comes to a close later in the movie.  I little more about these friends in the next paragraph.In the meantime Billie Joan Goodfellow who is a very very shy country girl from a very poor family has been having sex with several of Buster's friends in a way of getting some attention.  You are never made to feel anything but compassion for Billie you never think of her as a slut.  Her performance radiates innocents and loneliness and sadness and then joy and happiness later in the movie you can feel all her feelings as the movie progresses.When Buster can't holdout any longer for sex with Margie his attentions turn to Billie and are not honorable at first.  He finds her to be very very innocent and sees the beauty in her and finds himself falling in love but is not sure of his feelings reflecting his own youth and lack of experience to this new feeling called love.Before Buster even realized what his feelings are he acts on his basic instinct and feelings and breaks off his relationship with Margie and is seeing Billie exclusively.  You feel their new found love and see it as a rosebud just beginning to form.  Billie is taken to her first movie with Buster to see a Tarzan movie and you can see her elated joy at this new experience.  When Billie and Buster go swimming Buster looks over at her to see if she is taking off all her clothes before he strips to the bareass as if to not offend her.  It's little moments like this throughout the movie that all add up.  The getting up in the middle of the night and waiting for the sun to show itself at the horizon and they jump up and down and then hold each other in a very very loving manner is touching as well.  There are exchanges of gifts to one another and they both realize they love one another.  Billie is taken to a dance with Buster and you again feel her joy. Billie is lit up like a Christmas tree by this time and you can actually feel her and his joy and happiness. but especially hers.Meanwhile back at the ranch the boys that were getting laid by Billie before her selfesteem got elevated by her new love comes for some more poontang.  Of course Billie resist and fights back but is beaten raped and killed by these boys.Buster finds her body shortly after the killing and ends up killing two of the boys who had the evidence literally written on their faces. Buster is released from jail just after Billie's funeral and she was buried with only Buster's parents and the preacher being present her parents weren't even there.  The movie closes with the opening song and you get a big lump in your throat in the closing scene at the cemetery with Buster at Billie's graveside.I have seen reviews that see this movie as a sweet movie that turns into a sadistic mean spirited movie and was rated as a poor to fair movie because of it.  I do not subscribe to this view.  We live in a world where ugly things happen every day.  We can be sure of two things it was inevitable that these boys were going to come back for more poontang and that she would refuse them.  I'm not sure how else this outcome might be played out.  I suppose she could have been assaulted and then just told Buster about it and he could deal with it in a nonviolent manner.  We all like happy endings and I love a good Cinderella story as much as anyone.  American Beauty is a great movie and didn't end on a very happy note for the main character either but these same reviewers don't knock that go figure?Bottom line is this is one of my favorite movies.  I seen it at a drivein movie theater as the second feature back in 1974 when it was released and just bought a copy last month from an ebay seller.  It was sweeter then I remembered from 26 years ago.  Joan Goodfellow doesn't seem to have done any visible acting since 1984.  She gives one very sweet performance in this movie.  I give Joans performance an 11 and the movie a 10.   This movie will always have a soft spot in my heart.".

It was a true love story i remember crying so much and thinking Billie never had ever hurt anyone in her life or Buster. I loved it when he bought her that beautiful dress because she had never had anything. Buster was so in love with her and treated her so very special like Billie deserved. I would love to see it again if i could find it. I would for sure need tissues if i watched it again it was so very sad. I'm so glad they found one another and had a wonderful time together even though it was a short time. I hope all of you who enjoy a great movie get to see it. Tam from Indiana".

Another notable aspect is the fine and rather haunting musical score including the main theme sung by HOYT AXTON which never fails to bring a lump in my throat and made all the more lyrical by the movies tragic yet strangely touching ending.A fine unseen gem and well worth hunting down piece of 70's obscure 10 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Story takes place in Georgia 1948 Very touching bittersweet love story.  If you have not seen this movie then don't read this review and comments instead go get a copy.  Beg barrow or steal it and watch it as I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.I recommend seeing this movie in one sitting because it is a movie that slowly builds your feelings for the characters which will impact you more at the end of the movie.Buster Lane JanMichael Vincent is a typical country boy with maybe a little more scruples then the average southern country poke.  Buster is engaged to be married to Margie Pamela Sue Martin in the upcoming June and he has been playing touchy feely with her but she wants to wait until they're married to have intercourse. Buster's main friend is Whitey Robert EnglundFreddy Krueger and they hangout and drink beers together and take a trip to the ocean and we get an idea where Buster's friends minds and morals are at and this suffices as the story comes to a close later in the movie.  I little more about these friends in the next paragraph.In the meantime Billie Joan Goodfellow who is a very very shy country girl from a very poor family has been having sex with several of Buster's friends in a way of getting some attention.  You are never made to feel anything but compassion for Billie you never think of her as a slut.  Her performance radiates innocents and loneliness and sadness and then joy and happiness later in the movie you can feel all her feelings as the movie progresses.When Buster can't holdout any longer for sex with Margie his attentions turn to Billie and are not honorable at first.  He finds her to be very very innocent and sees the beauty in her and finds himself falling in love but is not sure of his feelings reflecting his own youth and lack of experience to this new feeling called love.Before Buster even realized what his feelings are he acts on his basic instinct and feelings and breaks off his relationship with Margie and is seeing Billie exclusively.  You feel their new found love and see it as a rosebud just beginning to form.  Billie is taken to her first movie with Buster to see a Tarzan movie and you can see her elated joy at this new experience.  When Billie and Buster go swimming Buster looks over at her to see if she is taking off all her clothes before he strips to the bareass as if to not offend her.  It's little moments like this throughout the movie that all add up.  The getting up in the middle of the night and waiting for the sun to show itself at the horizon and they jump up and down and then hold each other in a very very loving manner is touching as well.  There are exchanges of gifts to one another and they both realize they love one another.  Billie is taken to a dance with Buster and you again feel her joy. Billie is lit up like a Christmas tree by this time and you can actually feel her and his joy and happiness. but especially hers.Meanwhile back at the ranch the boys that were getting laid by Billie before her selfesteem got elevated by her new love comes for some more poontang.  Of course Billie resist and fights back but is beaten raped and killed by these boys.Buster finds her body shortly after the killing and ends up killing two of the boys who had the evidence literally written on their faces. Buster is released from jail just after Billie's funeral and she was buried with only Buster's parents and the preacher being present her parents weren't even there.  The movie closes with the opening song and you get a big lump in your throat in the closing scene at the cemetery with Buster at Billie's graveside.I have seen reviews that see this movie as a sweet movie that turns into a sadistic mean spirited movie and was rated as a poor to fair movie because of it.  I do not subscribe to this view.  We live in a world where ugly things happen every day.  We can be sure of two things it was inevitable that these boys were going to come back for more poontang and that she would refuse them.  I'm not sure how else this outcome might be played out.  I suppose she could have been assaulted and then just told Buster about it and he could deal with it in a nonviolent manner.  We all like happy endings and I love a good Cinderella story as much as anyone.  American Beauty is a great movie and didn't end on a very happy note for the main character either but these same reviewers don't knock that go figure?Bottom line is this is one of my favorite movies.  I seen it at a drivein movie theater as the second feature back in 1974 when it was released and just bought a copy last month from an ebay seller.  It was sweeter then I remembered from 26 years ago.  Joan Goodfellow doesn't seem to have done any visible acting since 1984.  She gives one very sweet performance in this movie.  I give Joans performance an 11 and the movie a 10.   This movie will always have a soft spot in my heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another movie I remember watching on cable in the late 70's. JanMichael Vincent is great to watch here in his mid70's prime. The rest of the cast is decent as well and it is interesting to see a young Freddy Kruger act all dorky before he became a horror icon.The film sets up nicely a small town in the 40's where everyone knows everyone else and the local teenage boys screw around with a slut named Billie who is a pretty girl but who seems to have some sort of problem. Buster always refuses to participate with the gang in having sex with Billie mainly because he has his own girlfriend who is plans to marry. But he becomes attracted to Billie on his own and eventually starts dating her even breaking up with his own girlfriend in the process. All this leads up to a very violent ending where we all no doubt cheer on Vincent.The film is decent enough but it does lack in some areas especially in explaining a few certain things. For instance just what started this fascination with Billie in JanMichael's character in the first place? Especially since he had the prettiest girl in school already? It really doesn't make much sense. Was it because she slept with all the guys? That she was quiet? Maybe he knew she had some sort of problem? And even that the film never gets around to examining what Billie's problem really was. We can see that she is a little slow and extremely introverted is the problem a head problem? Was she beaten as a child by abusive parents? Maybe she was raped? Who knows. The ending of the film definitely is unsettling and sad. But even as Vincent loads his truck full of flowers you are left wondering just what it was that made him go so crazy over that girl.".

And not just for the skinnydipping scene! Buster was the most popular boy in school but not because he went along with the othersbut because he wouldn't... so they usually had to go along with him. He considered Whitey to be a real friend and not just fun to have around to make the butt of all their jokes.Billie was different too and yes at first Buster just wanted some real action he was a male after all but he liked her differences and her shyness. He obviously wasn't like the other boys who would visit her at night and then ignore her in school.He was intrigued by her because she gave everything and asked for nothing. Just about every scene his real girlfriend is in she's pouting or demanding or trying to make him toe a line she sets. That's what he was used to and expected because she was a nice girl.After a few dates with Billie the demands of his girlfriend pall he breaks up with her and he sees Billie in public.A scene at their church underscores the public hypocrisy of their friends when Buster brings Billie to church and his exgirlfriend flounces past making a rude remark while clinging to the arm of one of the better boys in town who is one of Billie's nighttime visitors.Apparently his guy friends felt it was OK to screw Billie and they were annoyed he wouldn't go with them but went by himself to see her but to BRING HER OUT IN FULL DAYLIGHT! TO CHURCH!! Completely unacceptable according to their superior standards. Oh yeah and she wasn't putting out anymore for them. Obviously that wouldn't do.So his friends took advantage of a situation and did what they wanted with Billie.Buster took care of her and then took care of them.Most women don't want to have fighting around  but if it's FOR them  well that's a different matter. Think of the fight scene at the end of Footloose. Now ladies be honest  if you'd been treated like Billie wouldn't you want your boyfriend to defend you? And who cares if he gets a little carried away bashing their heads in? And stealing all those flowers for her grave was wonderfully romantic.My only complaint is I haven't been able to find it yet on DVD. I only have an old videotaped copy from the late show one night. Blurry dark and chopped to shreds by the editors. It's still a great movie.".

It was an audience of 18 year olds and they were just blown out of their seats so to speak. Then of course we all settled down to the awful raping and the usual bashing and walked out crying. A big surprise in its day and a lot of peoples almost favourite teen experience movie. Also a good JMV film and a great memory of 70s cinema. Probably his best along with BIG Wednesday in 1978. Incredible to know JMV is now over 64 years old and not in good health. He was then and is still so popular and well remembered.".

A big surprise in its day and a lot of peoples almost favourite teen experience movie. Also a good JMV film and a great memory of 70s cinema. Probably his best along with BIG Wednesday in 1978. Incredible to know JMV is now over 64 years old and not in good health. He was then and is still so popular and well remembered.";

	schema:reviewBody "First if you are going to see this flick do not see an edited version on TV see the uncut video version if there is one which I doubt. I don't want to sound like a copycat of Matchstick's review but I wanted to write about when I saw this flick first and only one time since. I was 10 years old my family situation was a horrific mess that summer of 74. I was actually living with people I had never met before not even distant relatives who were taking care of me for the summer and it was a screwed up time needless to say although thank God they were good ? people. They took me along with them to see a double feature of Buster and Billie and Easy Rider in that order. Man what a movie to watch at 10! Well I guess nowadays kids are exposed to more adult stuff but I'm glad it was run before Easy Rider cause man I was noddin off on my own trip when those cats were in New Orleans! After the films were over you should have seen the looks those adults who brought me in to the movies got when people saw that I was watching both those films! Spoilers... I definitely remember the skinny dipping and the full frontal stuff Jan Michael from what I remember didn't suffer from the George Castanza shrinkage from the water lol only in the movies right guess thats the difference between the Big and little screen eh? and the double murder in the bar or was it a triple? caught the entire audience by surprise I think. Classic Ending that really made the movie special too. Highly recommended in the uncut version probably not a wise choice to show a 10 year old but I think I turned out OK despite it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was not able to get this movie out of my head days after seeing it. Buster and Billie is a powerful and poignant comingofage story but also just very stark tale of how brutal and cruel people can be sometimes. This film takes place in the 50's I believe but it's almost hard to determine the year. It's set in rural Georgia so it has a very backwoods atmosphere about it. Highschool buddies gather around to exchange girl and car stories and the talk of the town is 'Billie' Joan Goodfellow a very shy poor girl who lets this gang of upperclass boys do what they will to her. They basically come knocking at her door late at night she lives in a rundown shack with her 2 negligent parents take her out into the woods for gangsex! Billie goes willingly but with obvious sorrow. She's a lonely girl with no friends and 'this is the only way she knows how to find affection' as Buster later tells his father. Buster JanMichael Vincent is a carefree cocky young man who seems to have a penchant for taking oddball people under his wing. He drives his truck like a maniac and annoys the heck out of the local school bus driver. His best friend is Whitey played by a very young awkward Robert Englund of Nightmare on Elm Street fame! Whitey apparently was a tortured 'geek' when he first arrived at school but ever since Buster became his friend Whitey became popular. Buster is also a 'lone ranger' among his friends  he never joined the group visits to Billie's house late at night. He remarks to Jake the bartender that two things in a man's life should be private...Taking a s and getting laid. Buster is also engaged to marry Margie Pamela Sue Martin his highschool sweetheart. Because his girlfriend doesn't let him go 'all the way' when they park at night she's waiting until the wedding night of course Buster starts to lose patience with her. At school after a physical beatdown with the grumpy busdriver Buster notices Billie smiling at him. His friends steer him clear of her saying he shouldn't be seen with her at school. Buster introduces himself to Billie at lunchhour and invites her on a date. She accepts very very shyly. She obviously has a crush on him and the fact that he speaks to her like a human being is something totally new. So Buster takes Billie out on a date. It's still a sexual encounter but the fact that he takes her in his own truck and treats her very gently is something she has never experienced. So as their dates continue Buster starts to fall in love with her as well. He breaks up with Margie and takes Billie with him to church nonetheless in front of the whole town! It's scandal  his friends and his parents are shocked. Even the bartender Jake is offended that Buster would break up with a 'nice girl' like Margie and start taking up with a 'bad girl' like Billie. But Buster doesn't give into all the pressure from his friends or family. He continues to see Billie and Billie starts to show her real personality she's a bit of a free spirit like Buster. She loves to be in the truck when Buster drives fast. They jump in the river together naked this is the infamous JMV full frontal scene  where he looks like an Adonis!. Fatefully all is not meant to be so idyllic. One rainy stormy afternoon Billie innocently encounters the carload of Buster's so called friends. A horrifying chase and rape scene ensue and Billie's fate is sealed. Buster finds out  he just knows something has happened and he discovers her body in the dark damp woods behind her house. His rage is insurmountable and he tracks his friends down in local bar. In a frightening display of physical violence as only JMV can display he swiftly kills two of them and seriously maims the others! The movie ends with Buster at Billie's grave sitesadly saying goodbye.Wow it's some movie! Anyway the performance by Jan Michael Vincent is great. It wouldn't call it great acting but his gentle manner combined with his ability to threaten physical violence form a unique blend in this movie. His sheer beauty is also just staggering to see  he was truly one of the most beautiful actors to even grace the silver screen. Joan Goodfellow is heartwrenching in this movietoo bad she didn't appear in more films! And any fan of Robert Englund will enjoy this as well  he's such a funny geek in this!!".

It is a story about a time about life in the deep south and the bias's that existed in the 1940's. There are plenty of strong words used but they seem to belong in the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Buster And Billie has come down in legend as the film where JanMichael Vincent bore all for art and titillated more than a few women and gay men with what they saw. But past those few seconds people who saw this film in 1974 got to see a tender and sensitive story about teen love between two opposite type of people.Buster is the teen idol of the school popular and handsome and the child of some pious church going parents in his rural Georgia small town in the post World War II years. He's going out with teen queen Pamela Sue Martin and they're considered a golden couple in the town. Joan Goodfellow is Billie a sweet girl of easy virtue raised by some real white trash parents. She's popular too in a different way as the boys her town get to bleed the old lizard with her help.Vincent and Goodfellow in a most improbable romance fall for each other.

	onyx:emotionText "Buster And Billie has come down in legend as the film where JanMichael Vincent bore all for art and titillated more than a few women and gay men with what they saw. But past those few seconds people who saw this film in 1974 got to see a tender and sensitive story about teen love between two opposite type of people.Buster is the teen idol of the school popular and handsome and the child of some pious church going parents in his rural Georgia small town in the post World War II years. He's going out with teen queen Pamela Sue Martin and they're considered a golden couple in the town. Joan Goodfellow is Billie a sweet girl of easy virtue raised by some real white trash parents. She's popular too in a different way as the boys her town get to bleed the old lizard with her help.Vincent and Goodfellow in a most improbable romance fall for each other.

I don't know what the hell my parents were thinking taking a 6 yr. old me and my 4 yr. old sister in an Oldsmobile VistaCruiser station wagon. Sure we were real comfy with the seats folded down lying on blankets and pillows munching on popcorn but wow this movie really had an effect on me and it wasn't real good. As a young child I was able to grasp the concept of a deep love between Buster and Billie but when things began to get ugly it really freaked me out. All I remember after Buster's full frontal shot was Billie getting raped and then her being wrapped in cloth or mummified in some way this was 28 yrs. ago so the visual details elude me and then Jan Michael Vincent doing some kind of crazy karate move where he flips some dude with his arm on a pool table and killing a few guys. I have to tell you this shook my 70's innocent Disney perspective on life to the core! When we got home and I was in my pajamas brushing my teeth I started crying my eyes out. My mom came in and said Oh sweetie why are you crying? Was it because Billie died at the end of the movie?' I said No. But...umm ya...hell ya it was because you subjected me to this terrible rape and murder that would be hard even for an adult!! Again WTF were they thinking incidentally I will make them both read this review. Wow glad I got that out of my system! BTW hope I don't seem too harsh on my parents after all they seemed to think it was OK to let me stand up in the middle of the front seat in the blue Chevy Chevelle whilst speeding away and lie down in the back window when I was sleepy. WTF was up with my parents and most parents who owned automobiles until the early 80's!?!? LOL. Anyway don't let your 6 yr. olds see this movie and don't let them sleep near the back windshield sheesh!".

The girl is more likable and has what is called an easy reputation. The banter between the characters gives the feel of teenage 'hijinx and juvenile delinquency. A lot of people may want to see it just to see a future horror celebrity in an early film role and I don't think they will be disappointed. The performances are solid.

The videotape dates from 1986 and since Robert Englund who later played Freddy Kreuger appears in it albeit briefly towards the end the title is probably meant to suggest A Nightmare On Elm Street 1984. None of the actors' names are mentioned on the box although my box was cut so maybe the names just got cut off. Slashed Dreams is probably also meant to suggest slasher films but this is at most a protoslasher nobody gets killed and the only slashing is of one bad guy by another.The video box suggests that the movie starts with a skinnydipping scene with the characters watched by someone with a knife and then flashes back to how they got there. In fact it's entirely presented in chronological order starting with a bunch of young people in college. In a class they talk about the meaning of life and where people have their roots in the earth one suggests in heaven suggests another.One of the students Jenny brings up her friend Michael who'd dropped out of college and moved into the mountains. Her boyfriend doesn't think much of a dropout and he doesn't like Jenny's lifelong brainy friend either. At a frat party her boyfriend gets really belligerent and Jenny and her old friend drive off to find Michael.On the way they get directions at a country store. The proprietor is found in a back room rehearsing his night club act he says talking and singing on a microphone. He's a former radio star who's been forgotten played by the crooner Rudy Vallee. He's about the most chipper old man to ever warn a couple of young people not to go in the woods! He presses some Licorice Nips on them and tries to impress on them the need for a knife.They pass on the knife and make their way into the woods where they encounter a bear and find a cabin they think might be Michael's. It's made out of rather thin branches so that it is possible to see right through the walls. There are also windows and at least two large holes in the roof so that when they say they wish they could lock the door it sounds rather funny!There's an odd sort of rape scene in which one of the assailants seems to be at most dry humping a sleeping bag and he couldn't get it up either we learn and the other also seems to be doing some dry humping but also does some bruising faceslapping. Later some strange advice is given to the victim to push the demons out and to find some truth in what happened.The movie ends with one of the characters taking a slim illustrated hardcover book down from a shelf in Michael's cabin and reading Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. Even as the stone of the fruit must break that its heart may stand in the sun so must you know pain.... And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.

	schema:reviewBody "Well the other reviewer was right when yelling out that Slashed Dreams is NOT A HORROR MOVIE but it does feature some typical exploitation trademarks. The setting is somewhat similar to the classic Deliverance there's the constant menace of imbecile hillbillies and of course the obligatory bit of sleazy images of an attractive girl skinnydipping. So I understand how this movie ended up in the horror section of video stores but that still doesn't tell you how irredeemably BAD it is! For the first time ever I really can't determine the raison d'tre of a film. Seriously what IS the point? Is this movie supposed to teach young people that it's okay to search for the meaning of life but still always watch out for rapists? If so that's a pretty lousy and invaluable lifelesson! Or maybe this whole production is a hiking guide to promote the rural sites of Northern Californiabut of course always watch out for rapists. The plot involves a couple as they're on their way to visit a former college friend who exchanged civilization for a spiritual life in the Californian woods. For nearly a full hour the camera simply follows them walking up mountain paths climbing down rocks and sleeping next to a lake! Oh how fascinating! All this time THE most annoying songs can be heard performed by probably the lousiest female singer in America! It's basically the exact same song repeated 8 times but each time the stupid lyrics are different. Eventually two local idiots rape the girl but her heroic friends do very little to avenge her. Then the movie ends with the couple walking towards the sunset. Have they found the meaning of life yet? Who cares! In case you're considering to rent Slashed Dreams because it features an early role of Robert Freddie Englund well DON'T! He only appears in the last ten minutes and his character is the biggest weakling to ever hit the screen. I guess that after starring in this completely pointless movie Englund decided to exclusively play villains and evil monsters. Wise choice Robert.".

	schema:headline " Kathrine Baumann  TOTAL '70s HOTTIE!";
	schema:reviewBody "There's really only one good reason to see this film and it really only applies to heterosexual males with big breast fetishes and that reason is '70s uberhottie Kathrine Baumann who appears here in her only nude scenes to date first skinnydipping with future TV Dr. Strange Peter Hooten then later getting sort of raped by James Keach. I know it's totally politically incorrect for me to call it 'sort of' when in fact she is assaulted and the assault is sexual in nature though apparently no actual penetration takes place as Keach has trouble getting it up. This is a peculiar film. As several previous reviewers have mentioned it's been misleadingly retitled via cheaplooking video effects as 'Slashed Dreams' with Robert Englund's participation played up in order to make a faux tiein with the thencurrent 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series. To all you slasher movie fans out there to avoid disappoint please note that this is NOT a horror movie or a slasher movie nor does it contain any notable violence other than some lame fisticuffs and an assumedly unintentionally comical hatchetvsknife showdown at the end. This film could however be grouped in that unpleasant subgenre of 'Deliverance'inspired movies from the '70s where naive citydwellers go into the wilderness where local inbred redneck perverts rape sodomize and otherwise make them regret ever having left town.It starts out on a college campus where students Baumann and Hooten receive a letter from mutual friend Englund who has gone off into the woods and built himself a cabin so that he can 'find himself'. Baumann's ahole boyfriend very convincingly played by Ric Carrot senses the threat that the bulge in Hooten's pants represents to his relationship with Baumann and he antagonizes them both to the point where they do run off together to look for Englund.On the way there they stop in a small town store to ask for directions where they encounter proprietor Rudy Valee conducting one of his patented radio programs for a phantom audience. Instead of quietly backing out the door they give him time to spot them and invite them in. Now in an alternate universe Rudy Valee would turn out to be the psychopathic killer who would then proceed to stab Hooten to death and turn his pancreas into a hairnet while Baumann ran screaming into the night...but alas this movie is nowhere near that interesting.What follows next looks like a cigarette ad from Playboy Magazine circa 1973 come to life with Hooten and Baumann wandering through the woods climbing a steep gravel slope encountering a bear getting into a blueberry fight and generally bringing the film to a grinding halt and it was only in first gear to begin with.Eventually they find Englund's cabin but he's not home so they go skinnydipping. Since this is a PGrated film Baumann's stripdown is discreetly screened by a VERY INCONSIDERATE bush  but then she skips into the shallows and because of how she's built you can pretty much see everything anyway. Hooten soon joins her and then they are leered at and accosted by Keach and his microcephalic companion. Later back at Englund's cabin no he's still not home Baumann and Hooten finally get it on  and are awakened later by Keach and his buddy who've dropped by for some forced copulation. While a knife is held to Hooten's throat Keach tries to accomplish the act but has potency issues. His buddy then in turn is more interested in slapping the st out of Baumann rather than copulating with her.The next morning Englund finally shows up gives Baumann a little therapeutic pep talk in which she actually displays more acting chops than she was generally credited with having. Later that morning the three of them run into Keach and his goonbuddy there's the aforementioned fight the bad guys are mildly wounded and flee. Baumann and Hooten head back into town.That's it. It's taken me almost as long to type all of that as it probably would take to watch this entire movie which runs under 80 minutes.Oh and be warned far more horrific than anything you'll see on screen is the truly TRULY awful soundtrack music by some unknown and rightly so female folkstylesoft 'vocalist' whose inane excruciating nailsonblackboard screeching is enough to make one wish that Freddie Kruegher would show up and rip out her larynx with his patented clawfingers. Now THAT would have made for a memorable movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once upon a time there was this sincere but painfully dated hippie era melodrama called SUNBURST about life and love and the importance of getting back to nature to find yourself... Then comes the video boom era of the 1980s and a rising star emerging in the horror genre for playing a certain faciallyscarred predator who kills teenagers in their sleep. I can see the distributors now... Well we got the rights to this old movie full of simpleminded 70s philosophy that nobody's going to want to see now but Robert Englund has a small role in it... Now get this how about we put England's name on a horrorlooking video box and retitle it something like say SLASHED DREAMS that will make people think it's like another Elm Street movie? Well that precisely what happened with this one. It's not a horror movie and there are only two brief scenes that could conceivably land it in the genre the first is a somewhat botched gang rape around a campfire and the other is the revenge scene with two guys fighting with hatchets and knives that is cut short before any blood could be spilled when one of the characters decides to do the sensible thing... So by all means don't watch this thinking you're going to be terrified by a knife killer stalking a random halfnaked cutie by moonlight the eye catching image on the video box. Here we basically have a story of two goodlooking California college students named Robert Peter Hooten and Jenny Kathrine Baumann falling in love. She's dating an immature frat bully named Mitchell Ric Carrott but decides to end the relationship because Mitch is a complete dkhead who doesn't understand her and makes one of his pledges do a poolside striptease wearing female underwear and Mickey Mouse ears. So Robert and Jenny decide to visit a mutual friend named Michael Sutherland Englund who dropped out of college his freshman year to live as a hermit in a shack in the woods.  For the majority of the movie we get the pair visiting a general store to listen to the owner Rudy Vallee do a monologue and sing trecking through the forest trying to go up cliffs merrily skipping through the fields and getting all mushy on us by giving each other gooeyeyed looks snuggling and rubbing berries in each others faces. After a bear eats all their food they do eventually arrive at Michael's lakeside shack only to find he's not home. They go skinnydipping get it on by the campfire and are then harassed by two obnoxious redneck goons played by scriptwriters James Keach would eventually marry actress Jane Seymour and David Pritchard. The two halfwits knock Robert out and one starts to slap around and rape Jenny but they pull out early and leave. So then Michael shows up the next morning and the three friends work through the trauma. Basically Jenny is spoon fed some bullst about how life is sometimes cold and cruel but you've just got to get over it and move on which is probably going to come off as being pretty offensive to real rape victims. Robert does encounter the goons once more and basically rolls around in the mud with one of them for a minute to get out his frustrations. The goons run off into the woods and Robert Michael and Jenny all laugh and give each other a big bear hug. The end. So basically it's all a sensitive message movie about the virtues of being a simpleheaded pacifist a sortof wellmeaning but hopelessly naive antithesis of Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS. Much of the soundtrack is composed of a collection of lame songs about how animals are clumsy too and the world being full of warmhearted people with warmhearted reasons sung by some highpitched squealer trying to emulate Carole King. The acting and nature photography are both OK. Leading lady Baumann who has some brief nude scenes was a former Miss Ohio and Miss America finalist who also appeared in THE THING WITH TWO HEADS 1972. The cast includes Anne Lockhart as Mitchell's exgirlfriend and Peter Brown as a college professor.".

	schema:reviewBody "1975's Slashed Dreams should be on a doublebill with 1973's Caged Terror another film that strived for a pretentious deep man message and also featured a young white heterosexual couple out in the woods skinnydipping no frontal this time and being terrorized by two creepy men. Both films also feature the man smearing something reddish onto the woman's face. Perhaps Slashed Dreams is the remake of Caged Terror. How necessary.The setup is simple A female college student with a boyfriend who loves her but conveniently is a major jerk heads off to the woods with her saintly childhood male friend of whom the boyfriend is jealous and so makes of at every opportunity. Deep in the woods is their college dropout friend Michael played by postWhitey preFreddy Krueger Robert Englund. He has built an almost seethrough cabin in the woods and has apparently found the answer to life's problems and subsequently softtalking innerpeace by doing so. The jerk boyfriend also made fun of Michael natch. The film turns out to be a musical. As with Caged Terror there is not much of a story therefore there is much padding. An unfortunate selection of songs  seemingly appearing every seven minutes  were chosen to make the viewer feel happy or sad depending on the scene. The songs are mostly sung by a female in earsplitting fashion and all of them give 70s folk music a bad name. In one scene as the woman tries to follow the man up to a cliff the weight of the camping gear on her back causes her to slide down the dirt. This scene is accompanied by a song apparently entitled Animals Are Clumsy Too a lighthearted song that reminds us that for every time we find ourselves bumping our knee against a bedpost somewhere there is a calf walking around with one leg stuck in a milk jug.Since this happy young couple receive  yet laugh off  a warning about wandering the woods alone it is certain that something bad will happen. And it does. And then the movie meanders along while the bad thing seems to go through the seven stages of grief. Michael finally shows up and apparently has discovered the ways of the Native Americans and therefore brews up just the right tea for the traumatic occasion.A poem found in a book seems to be the key to the film's outcome and I was left saying What?? It seems that as in Caged Terror being the recipient of a certain act of violence is actually a GOOD thing for it elevates the victim to a higher plane freeing her or himself of physical and spiritual shackles and leading her or him to a greater understanding of the world and to a calming innerpeace. Not only does this film give ammunition to anti70s folk music sentiment but to New Age beliefs as well.This is even less 'worthseeing' than Caged Terror.".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing Sunburst I'm still trying to figure out why Rudy Vallee bothered to appear in it. Certainly the audience this film was reaching at thousands of driveins across the country wasn't going to be buying his records.This outdoors film which relies on a lot of nature shots to fill in the story gaps has Peter Hooten and Katherine Bauman dissatisfied with college and the imbeciles that they find going there lately. Possibly their friend Robert Englund who has gone back to the Sixties and back to nature with his tune in turn on and drop out philosophy may have the answer. He's off in the woods of Northern California and Hooten and Bauman are off to find him.Unfortunately before they find Englund they run into a couple of bottom feeding inbreds played by James Keach and David Pritchard. More I cannot say because things do degenerate from here. Let's just say their actions might have stimulated a little of what goes in drivein theaters so the exhibitors might have booked Sunburst with that in mind.Robert Englund of course went on to play Freddy Kruger in several slasher flicks with Freddy as the central character. Vallee plays a small role as a storekeeper who still sings some of his old hits. He sounded a lot better on The Whiffenpoof Song in his prime.Nice cinematography and Rudy Vallee can't think of any other reason to watch Sunburst.".

	schema:reviewBody "Filmed in 1975 as Sunburst until it was released on VHS in the eighties retitled Slashed Dreams to take advantage of Robert Englund's popularity during the Nightmare on Elm Street craze this seventyfour minute exercise in hiking and rape is an absolute waste of film and can't even be saved by the curvaceous Kathrine Baumann's wasted nude scenes. Written by Stacy Keach's brother James who will always be Deputy Halik from Moving Violations to me Slashed Dreams is about two life long friends Jenny and Robert who go hiking into the wilderness of Northern California to visit their mutual friend Michael played by Robert Englund who doesn't show himself until the final twenty minutes of the film. Why going to see Michael is so important to Jenny and Robert is never explained only that Jenny really wants to see him. Fair enough. The first fortyfive minutes consists of the two traveling north and hiking through the woods. Sound like fun? It isn't. Nothing significant happens at all so why film any of this? While Jenny and Robert go skinny dipping they are spied on by two token hillbilly mountain boys Danker and writeractor James Keach as Levon. Once the pair set their sites on Jenny's pair well what do you think goes through their minds? Later that night they return to rape Jenny. Enter Michael who says little and provides next to nothing as far as support except for some hippie rambling about driving the devil out of your house. Way to counsel Freddy Krueger. Robert tries to redeem himself by fighting the rapists but no shock here he doesn't succeed. Afterwards Jenny comes to the realization that all is well. End of movie. What? If this summary doesn't stop you from watching this mess than let me deliver the dagger to your heart in the form of Roberta Van Dere. Who is she you ask? She's responsible for singing all of the songs on the soundtrack and by singing I mean tone deaf caterwauling that is so annoying that I attempted to drive pencils into my ear canals. Her singing is so bad it defies belief that someone listened to her and said you should do this professionally. Every song sounds exactly the same even her inappropriate howling following Jenny's rape. A cat thrown into a dryer would have sounded better than her. Do yourself a favor a leaf through and old Reader's Digest rather than waste your time on this crap.".

They are seen skinny dipping by two backwoods idiots one played by James Keach in an early rolewho later return to rape the female. You are probably thinking that surely now there will be a terrible price to pay for these two redneck morons as the couple will wreak bloody revenge upon them. You would be wrong. The boyfriend goes for a walk the next day and runs into the two dummys bickering amongst themselves and he goes after them with a small tomahawk but no blood is shed and the rednecks run off and everybody lives happily ever after. This is a boring slow moving poorly written and poorly acted film. The soundtrack is as lame as the rest of the movie as most of the songs remind you of the latter days of the Brady Bunch.

	schema:reviewBody "SLASHED DREAMS isn't a horror movie isn't a revenge thriller isn't a romance isn't social commentary it's well not much of anything.First the good news. Pretty much all of the people involved in this continued working and some did well. Robert Englund of course made the ELM STREET films. The editor went on to be nominated for an Oscar for DIE HARD. And the movie does have some parts that are fitfully entertaining.The bad news is that it's dull. It's dull as dishwater and at an hour and fourteen minutes seems endless.It's not a musical but it has songs lots of them. Every once in a while the plot screeches to a halt while a young woman sings fairly well and then two or three minutes later the plot gets back in gear.The script is the main culprit.We start on a college campus. Marshall a big shot in his fraternity is dating Jenny who looks as much like Ali McGraw in LOVE STORY a college student named Jenny in that hugely popular film as possible without hiring Ali McGraw. Jenny is friends with Robert who is strong but sensitive. Jenny has gotten a letter from Michael Robert Englund in a good performance a man who like Thoreau has gone to the woods to find the meaning of life. In Psychology class the professor Peter Brown from BIG VALLEY and the students discuss values. Then the scene changes and we never see the professor again despite his prominent billing in the opening titles.At a party Marshall humiliates a pledge and treats Jenny like dirt. Finally everyone including nice girl Tina heads out to visit Michael. After an incident of road rage Jenny breaks up with Marshall and only she and Robert go on to look for Michael. The other characters and subplots are abandoned.After many scenes of driving they come to a small town and go into a general store owned by Rudy Valee whose career had been revived a few years prior to this film by his work on Broadway in HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING and the film version of that show. Valee sings and talks about the old days of show business then warns Robert and Jenny that they shouldn't hike to Michael's cabin because they might wind up being hunted. He tries to sell them a knife they decline and another subplot lies in the dust.Rudy Valee's dialog would seem to set us up for a BLAIR WITCH ADVENTURE situation almost a quarter of a century before that film was made. Instead the story goes in more mundane directions. And Valee seventy some years old is the best thing about the film this would be a zero star film but it got two for Valee and two for Robert Englund playing a nice person.We watch endless footage of Robert and Jenny walking and walking. They climb a steep hill while a terrible song called Animals Are Clumsy Too reminds us how humorless what's happening is. They get to Michael's cabin but he's not home so they go skinny dipping.At this point screenwriteractor James Keach realizes that he's given us tons and tons of exposition but the title SLASHED DREAMS is not appropriate to the soap opera romance he's written so he introduces two psychos to menace the lovebirds. Keach who at this point in life looked a lot like Buster Keaton plays one of them and overacts. The other one gets far less dialog. Hey if I'd written this I'd have given myself the best lines too.Robert and Jenny get back to the cabin and have a firelit love scene then the psychos intrude and do the things psychos are supposed to do in movies like this. They have no motivation for this but the screenplay says they do it. Robert and Jenny survive but are much the worse for wear.Michael arrives and they tell him what happened. Since we've watched random story elements from DELIVERANCE DEATH WISH and STRAW DOGS we figure that the third act will be bloody retribution. This would provide a nice character arc for these intellectual young people who seem so introspective in nature.Instead Robert goes after the psychos with an ax and has a fight and they leave and Michael tells him they won't be back. He has no way to know that but it's what the script says.In the cabin Jenny reads I think it's from THE PROPHET which everyone was still reading in 1975 about pain. Another skinny dipping scene then the lovebirds start back toward their everyday lives sadder but wiser.The closing titles run over a freeze frame of the lovebirds Jenny's Ali McGraw style hair artfully backlit by the setting sun.The romantic triangle on campus could have been a whole film. The idealismmaterialism theme introduced in the campus scenes could have been a whole film. The old time entertainer leaving the bright lights of Hollywood to live in a wide place in the road could have been a whole film. The theme of a man turning his back on society to live a life of contemplation could have been a excellent film with Jenny and Robert the snakes in his Eden ultimately forcing him to make a hard choice. The two possibly inbred madmen were a clich in 1975 and should have stayed on the cutting floor.I love horror movies especially the Friday THE 13TH and HALLOWEEN types where I can shout Don't go upstairs! to characters and royally confuse my family because I watch movies with headphones after midnight and we live in a one story house. Watching SLASHED DREAMS I wanted to shout at the screenwriter Pick one story and tell IT!".

	schema:reviewBody "A young couple drive to the woods to find an old friend who has decided to live a life in the wilderness. After a kindly man at the local trading post tells them it's dangerous and offers them a knife they disregard him and his offer. Big mistake! Not long after getting deep in the woods they encounter two men with devious plans.I acquired this film as part of a box set of chilling movies which seems to be a mix of horror and mafia movies. How to classify this one I'm not entirely sure. It is not horror in the standard sense the mood isn't dark the movie is not really scary and there's no real supernatural force to be overcome. There are two miscreants but they are quite ordinary in almost every way.This film has what I think of as three Wes Craven similarities prior to Wes Craven's career taking off. As such I consider this to be a horror precursor film setting the stage for horror movies of the future.1. The basic plot is not unlike Last House on the Left  two innocent teenagers who come into contact with some violent criminals and their day is completely ruined from there. Last House is far more disturbing and the story continues to a much more horrific ending. Yet there is something of a similarity here innocence being overtaken by perfectly human forces. And you will be left a bit disturbed after seeing Slashed Dreams unless you're really a pervert.2. The music is also like Last House in that it is very happy and fits the 1970s have a nice day image. For most of Slashed Dreams the music is appropriate because the couple really is quite happy. But like Last House it seems completely contrary to the film once things begin to happen. Like Singing in the Rain from A Clockwork Orange happy music over a nasty film is very psychologically disturbing.3. This film has an early appearance by Robert Englund who would go on to play Freddy Krueger. While Englund is the hero in this movie and not a sadistic bad guy he is associated with horror for many people  in fact I would be hardpressed to name a role he had outside of horror. But if you want to see him smiling and laughing here's the film for you.Despite the low rating I really do recommend this movie. The main problem is the film is dated and runs very slow  almost nothing happens for much of the movie. But if you are interested in the history of horror I think this is something of a missing link. I have to believe this film inspired Wes Craven to make Last House on the Left and to later cast Robert Englund. For this to be merely a coincidence would be absurd. So if you want to see the seeds of Craven I think you might like this one.".

Naive selfabsorbed college students get into a big plastic hassle with their friends and peers about the meaning of life and decide to go visit their friend who dropped out and really got himself back together or some such in some California woods. There they run into some sinister locals who eventually assault them then their friend finally shows up and helps them get unsatisfying revenge and comforts them with Kahlil Gibran Sp? and they walk off into the sunset. The end.The movie tries to combine travelogue social commentary philosophy about the meaning of lifesuspenseaction and cheesecake. It manages to do OK with the cheesecake because the young lady is fairly hot...but the rest of it is either dull as dishwater the nature scenes or badly staged and unconvincing the violence or as selfimportant and as deep as Rod McKuen. For all that it was fairly short it felt like the longest 80 minutes I've spent watching a movie in many months and I just finished watching a string of nonclassics like The Beast With 1000000 Eyes and Snow Creature.I'm rating the movie a bit higher than I really want to because it does try to be about something and it seems to be a victim of exploitative afterthefact repackaging.Someone going to see a movie called Sunburst is expecting an entirely different experience from someone going to see a movie called Slashed Dreams.".

	schema:reviewBody "As far as disaster movies go 'The Tower' hardly reinvents the wheel but even though it sticks to formula audiences looking for Bmovie thrills will love the adrenaline rush it gives you from start to finish. Clearly inspired by the 1974 Hollywood classic 'The Towering Inferno' it uses the same premise of a luxurious skyscraper that catches fire one fateful day to devise a continuous series of highoctane action sequences that will keep you on the edge of your seat.True to its genre the first halfhour is spent introducing the bevy of characters whose fates will intertwine. Chief among them is the building's security and maintenance operations manager Daeho Kim Sang gyeong a single father to a precocious young girl Hana whom he promises to that it will snow on Christmas Eve. That is also the reason why Hana eventually finds herself at the illfated Tower Sky residential complex made up of two adjacent towers connected by a sky bridge at the 70th floor.Daeho is infatuated with kitchen manager Yoonhee Son Yejin who offers to look after Hana while he goes about ensuring that the preparations for the management's lavish Christmas Eve party go according to plan. The occasion turns out to be the reason of the calamity as the management's egotistical President Cho Cha Inpyo arranges a fleet of helicopters to rain snow down from near the top of the building  despite being earlier advised of possible strong vertical drafts  just so he can impress the residents. After seeing his wish of a 'White Christmas' come true an even more wowing spectacle awaits when a sudden gust causes one of the helicopters to lose control and crash into one of the twin towers. Immediately the upper floors become engulfed in flames leading to the activation of the men stationed at the Yeoudio Fire Station  including the veteran captain Youngkee Sul Kyunggu who forsakes his promise to his wife to spend the night with her in order to join his comrades in the firefight.Youngkee turns out to be a key player in the rescue of those trapped as Kim Sangdon's workmanlike screenplay sets him up as the proverbial selfless hero whose bravery is ultimately milked for highpitched theatrics. The rest of the characters are similarly delineated in terms of tropes  whether Daeho as the nervewracked father constantly worrying about the safety of his daughter or President Cho as the devious businessman cum de facto villain of the film. The most inspired bit of Sangdon's writing is in the addition of a group of devout Christians gathered to celebrate Christmas for comic relief whose prayers for help are inadvertently always answered.It is to director Kim Jihoon's credit that the film never has a dull moment despite the formulaic script. Right from the start he confidently demonstrates his ability to navigate seamlessly between the various pointsofview of the various characters and that adroitness proves useful in maintaining a tense and taut atmosphere throughout the movie. He also keeps the movie wellpaced and easy to follow with the first half focused on extinguishing the fire from within its source and the second on evacuating as many people as possible before the weakened tower collapses under its own weight.Within that twoact narrative Jihoon engineers some truly gripping sequences. The helicopter crash is the first of the moneyshots and by deftly combining actual images with CGI it amply demonstrates that the Koreans have caught up with Hollywood in terms of visual effects. Besides the spectacle two particular scenes stand out  the first where a ragtag group of survivors make a perilous crossing from one tower to another using the sky bridge whose steel and glass structure is at risk of collapsing and the second where who's left of the same group pack themselves into an elevator and attempt to freefall it down around 60 floors to escape the crumbling tower.Next to the topdrawer special effects the cast and their acting unfortunately play second fiddle. Nonetheless they play their roles with conviction in particular Sanggyeong and Kyunggu  though the most memorable actor here is not one of the leading cast but rather Kim Inhwon who plays a jocular firefighter hailed as a saviour by the group of Christians after turning up at a particularly opportune moment.Still the main attraction is the visuals which under Jihoon's confident hand who was also behind 'Sector 7' prove to be very impressive for an Asian film. Any criticism that the pleasures to be had here are no more than Bmovie thrills is moot  after all that's exactly what 'The Tower' intends to deliver. Indeed if you're looking for a gripping twohour adrenaline high then this bigbudget action disaster film is just that shot in the arm for sheer exhilaration.".

There's no water available on the critical floors so the fire spreads. There are lots of people trapped inside the building and rescuers doing their best to save them.Really you know what you're going to get there's no surprises and it all comes down to how well executed the action sequences are and whether we care about the people involved in the tragedy. For me this film works. Granted it's Korean and subtitles take some of the tension away as your eyes are flicking to the bottom of the screen to see what's bring said. But this film really works as a 21st Century disaster film.There's lots of big action sequences big fires explosions burning bodies falling bodies tons of special effects. It's all exciting stuff in a very PG sort of way.Taking advantage of knowledge gained in the 911 disaster we see steel frameworks buckling people tacking pleas to find their loved ones on nearby walls burning debris falling from the top of the building everything that happens to modern buildings when they burn.My biggest criticism of the film is that there are too many characters. The film takes 30 minutes before the fire starts and in that time we meet the maintenance manager and his child the restaurant manager the head chef the incompetent chef the incompetent chef's girlfriend the maintenance manager's friend the rookie fireman the fireman sergeant the work obsessed fireman the lottery winner the Christian the mother of a college student the college student the building manager the building owner the snooty woman and her dog and so on and so on. Really there are just too many. Cutting the number down and shortening the introduction would have improved this film a lot allowing us to care more for fewer characters.Whilst most of the film is deadly serious there is some light relief provided to make the film more watchable  two hours of relentless disaster is just too depressing. In particular the character of the fireman sergeant is likable comical but still very serious in his actions. My favourite moment comes when he prays for and gets a tsunami dozens of floors up the building.I can't imagine this film being made in America post 911 and many Americans may find it too distressing to watch but as a reboot of the disaster film genre it's great success.".

The main leads all do their job very well and although there are some sentimental parts like in the majority of Korean movies they are handled all too well and they just work.This movie is amazing it has all the ingredients of the disaster movies the director really did a superb job and I am sure you will have lots of fun with it.It is a copy of The Tower Inferno? well yes ! for the most part... SO WHAT?Americans do tons of rereremakes over and over again and nobody complains it's not fair to do this to the Koreans they managed to do a better Tower Inferno by a long margin.Keep up the good work! Now I am incredible excited about the next production coming out of Korean Soil !Love it!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Tower A 2012 Korean disaster movie.SPOILERS AHEAD!Story Summary It's a Korean movie about a high rise tower going up in flames. What more do you really need to know?This movie hearkens back to the days when Hollywood made self contained disaster flicks on a regular basis i.e. Poseidon Adventure the Airport not Airplane movies and the like and of course the obvious comparison being Towering Inferno. There's not a whole lot of variances afforded when you make a film like this. After all it's a disaster film in a ship building plane or what have you so it's basically just try to mitigate the damage save as many people as you can and see who if anybody makes it out alive. What you can do though is try to have the viewers invest in some of the characters provide an engrossing film with a decent enough story some nice pacing  action and not make your stunts  effects look like crap. Does this film succeed on those fronts?...Yeah pretty much.Everything centers around the buildup to the Christmas celebration at the fabulous Sky Towers buildings. The first 30 minutes of the film or so are devoted to introducing the people who'll be the integral players in the disaster to come they include various hotel  building employees some guests and love interests the firemen who show up on the scene some side groups and the kid gotta have a kid involved this is a mandatory disaster movie rule. There's some ominous foreshadowing about high winds and a busted sprinkler system along the way but screw it let's send in the helicopters to drop fake snow on the buildings to appease our VIP guests as planned. What could possibly go wrong here?OK it's holiday party time! Where are those snow dropping helicopters?...Oh here comes one now! Uhoh!...What was that about the strong winds and a bad sprinkler system again?...From there this is Disaster Movie 101 and it's pretty entertaining for the most part.This movie is what it is meaning it's basically a popcorn action flick with little room for much else. The entire cast does a fine enough job but there's not much for them to do past the  mark other than run for their lives. There are some decent action set pieces where the characters have to escape the flames while traversing various floors  elevator shafts navigate sky walks  scaffolding before they collapse etc...This is all done with a fairly solid mix of live action stunt work and CGI. You also get your standard dose of Korean melodrama along the way of course but it's not really any more melodramatic than those old American disaster flicks mentioned above this movie really does play just like those films except it's more modern and from a different country.Bottom Line It works well enough overall!...If you're looking for a fantastic story  dialogue driven Korean film then this ain't for you!...But if you want to just chill and watch a decent actiondisaster flick from Korea then this will probably fit the bill!I think it's in the 67 out of a 10 star range!...Ehhhh! I'll give it 7 stars!".

The Tower 2012 is a big improvement in terms of overall quality.If this isn't an official remake of The Towering Inferno 1974 it probably should have been. There are quite a few differences but the similarities are too numerous to be a coincidence. A Christmas Eve party at a luxury residential building takes a horrific turn when a fire breaks out. The opening half hour has some hitormiss humor but the characters are given color. The incident that causes the fire is unexpected and cool. The terror and panic that quickly follows is also well staged. Thereafter events move at breakneck speed and there are a number of dangerous thrilling moments some of which involve side effects of the fire instead of the fire itself. Direction is impressive and exciting.In fact I'd go so far as to say that The Tower is a better and more entertaining film than The Towering Inferno. The 1974 film was good but overlong and oddly tedious. This 2012 film has better pacing and more excitement. However I would recommend watching them backtoback for a fun firey evening!".

It's slightly melodramatic as is the case with a lot of Asian cinema but it's also highly efficient with it. It may not be up there with the best of the genre but it's better than the comparable likes of AFTERSHOCK and THE SINKING OF JAPAN.The narrative takes on a familiar construction with the first half hour building the characters before letting rip with a major accident then working its way through a series of alternative disaster scenarios. Survivors are fried dropped blown up and put into various perilous situations and it's all handled with more than a modicum of efficiency by director Kim Jihoon. It's also well paced and technically efficient with decent CGI adding to the peril and some wellplaced comic relief offsetting the more dramatic moments.Is THE TOWER original? Not a jot. Is it as good as the original? Not by a long shot. Is it entertaining? Oh yes. It may be no classic but as modern disaster cinema goes this is one of the better ones you'll find out there.".

The first 30 minutes is all character development which I didn't mind that much. My only issue would be the cheesy comedic relief characters which continue to attempt to be funny in a film containing lots of drama and disaster which I felt is not good for a film like this. I appreciate black comedy but this just felt like it was trying to make us laugh for the sake of laughing and it didn't mix well with the rest of the serious events in the film. There was some melodrama for sure as there is with a lot of Korean movies but it felt like it had it's place in this movie. I must mention the CGI because generally with Asian films I think the CGI is lacking but this one actually did quite a good job. I think the film could have been shortened because I found myself losing interest at some points even though there was action occurring and that is due to the length. I think if these little flaws were fixed it could have been a really fun and enjoyable flick but I just felt that the flaws weighed it down and made me enjoy it less than I would like to have.".

	schema:reviewBody "You can't help but to think of and compare this to the 1974 movie The Towering Inferno given the many similarities between the two films. One of my favourite big budgeted spectacle of a disaster type movie from the 70s this Korean version written by Kim SangDon settles for similar set action pieces from the parties to the incidents to some of the solutions while adding some of the inherent melodrama from Korea coupled with a very stark and rather there for laughs portrayal of those with religious faith. It is a decent attempt but one that wasn't out there first.Director Kim JiHoon had crafted a decent film that's paced right for a disaster epic of this scale balancing the ensemble characters with scenes for each to shine in while priming caricatures for certain death as you would expect for the body count to rise. Set action pieces were commendably designed from massive fire fighting to rescue missions and moments where characters find themselves in dead end situations given the set up from early on within the first ten minutes outlining areas where challenges would be dished out from non working sprinklers to weather advice that goes defiantly unheeded. Naturally there's the usual karma and retribution elements being weaved in with room to showcase heroism and sacrifice. And given the subject matter there's also the educational element when criticizing mass panic that leads people to do the most irrational things rather than what's right in the various scenario presented.And this film is no less starstudded than its Hollywood counterpart too spearheaded by Song YeJin as YunHee the restaurant manager making her rounds in preparation for a Christmas Eve party as does the single dad and tower operations manager DaeHo Kim SangKyung who also forms the complimentary beau for Yun Yee with daughter HaNa Jo MinAh in tow that lends that fatherdaughter angle especially when the two loves of his life get stuck in the building leading to a sort of rescue objective of sorts. Then there's the play up of the fire department from courageous captain Kang YoungKi Sol KyungGu to Do Ji Han playing a rookie fire fighter and Kim InKwon as another unlikely fire fighter here to provide some light comic relief.But while this film has a number of characters rotating through the scenes for their individual spotlight moments the characterization's much left to be desired and ultimately you don't really feel nor connect with their plight that much. Unlike the Hollywood version where you really feel for the various characters and get your adrenaline pumping with each death defying situation they have to face and overcome in order to survive Kim JiHoon didn't manage to elicit the same genuine feelings. You hardly root for the characters nor feel a tinge of sadness to those who had to fall and for those who deserve some just desserts they get largely forgotten in the thick of things. Lee HanWi who plays a church elder celebrating Christmas with his mini congregation was also a character played for laughs where every moment of prayer becomes answered not by divine intervention but intervention through coincidence nonetheless.In order to differentiate itself and pose a larger challenge the tower here refers to the fictional Tower Sky buildings with two massive skyscrapers reaching for the sky reflecting on the obsession of architects who pander to the competition of having the tallest building in whichever modern city and linked together through a glass bridge that you know is nothing more than a set up for something later on in the movie. Even though it's fictional with reliance on CG to provide the illusion of scale and mass the tower does become a character in itself though in less successful terms if compared against the Hollywood original. CG was also obviously used in many of the disaster scenes such as having choppers crash onto the facade and through into the building to become the catalyst. But CG cannot be used to replace solid storytelling which is that little trip up that The Tower had suffered at various points where scenes felt disparate and transitions didn't gel too well.But The Tower has its moments and would thrill the new film goer who hasn't seen The Towering Inferno but to those who have this Korean version hardly throws up something new nor surprising coming off as a shallower knock off that could have done a lot better with the material and resources at its disposal. Still it did good business at the Korean box office and".

	schema:reviewBody "While The Tower may come off as a Korean remake of The Towering Inferno but even so this is a thrill ride that doesn't skimp on emotion either. A moving effective and thrilling disaster piece once it gets going it rarely lets up.At the center of the film is Daeho a single father who helps manage the safety of Sky Tower a fictional superhigh rise in Korea. Home to many luxurious apartments and amenities including a restaurant. Taking place on Christmas Eve a massive party turns into a massive disaster as an accident sets the building ablaze. Daeho's daughter who joined him for the party becomes stranded and Daeho attempts to rescue her. Helping him are the nearest firefighters who make a heroic attempt to save the people trapped inside and put out the blaze.The film has a number of secondary characters and side stories all of whom we're introduced to within the first 30 minutes. The film does a good job setting up our characters and giving us reasons to care about them from the cleaning woman and her college age son whose tuition she supports to the elderly couple of whom the man in the relationship is trying to be more supportive and caring towards his wife. Each of these side characters has great moments and you care enough about them to want to see them all survive. When the time comes that not all of them make it it's truly tragic. It helps that the acting even if a bit melodramatic is effective. Daeho in particular is an effective father who never comes off as less than heroic.However the heart of the film is the disaster itself and more so than any film in the past couple years the disaster here is truly epic and effective. While the film isn't terribly gruesome it doesn't shy away from showing us the tragedy or effects of the disaster in the film. There is a bit of blood here and there but most of what is effective is due to the scale of the disaster or the intimacy that we have with the people effected by the chaos. One great example comes from an elevator full of people who become trapped amidst a floor with a raging fire. The film doesn't shy away from giving us a glimpse inside the elevator for effect.And once the disaster does hit the film rarely slows down. Obstacle after obstacle is thrown in the path of our characters. Not everyone makes it giving the film an edge of suspense that leaves you wondering who will make it out alive and who won't. Disaster films are at their best when they display two things the tragedy these disasters bring and the suspense of never really knowing what is going to happen next. The Tower brings tons of both. All in all this is a great film with a wonderful heart.".

All the characters you are meant to like you like and those you hate you hate. The actors of the firefighters particular stood out to me especially the captain. Throughout the whole film there I sympathized and rooted for the character to get out of the tower alive.The special effects both CGI and real are something to be marveled at. The fire looks dangerous and scary and is a great set piece for some shots especially in a scene where some firefighters are fighting the fire on a walkway with the group of men silhouetted against the raging fire. The debris and glass that rains down on the characters as well just make the film more tense and horrific. The film has amazing suspenseful parts with a scene involving a glass bridge being very well shot and with a great tension throughout the whole scene.The film was a fantastic watch and one of the few films where I had a lump in my throat as well as having me on the edge of my seat when the first flame lit up the tower. A great film and well worth a watch one of the best disaster films I have seen in the last few years. ".

Firefighters struggle against impossible odds to save those trapped in the towering inferno.I will say that there are many similarities to the tragic events of 911 and as such I don't doubt that not everyone will find enjoyment in The Tower or might actually find it distasteful. I however saw it as entertainment nothing more nothing less. It is only a movie after all.The CGI effects in The Tower were phenomenal and came off as quite realistic and believable.

The acting wasn't good especially in the first half hour of the movie some of actors were just horrible way overacting and shouting at the screen. Later when the mood and setting changed acting was starting to be better. Overall this is enjoyable flick if you can close your eyes at the horrible acting in the beginning of the movie and enjoy the ride of this disaster flick.

The acting fits perfectly with the dialog it is equally horrendous. And the predictability factor is off the charts here's how predictable it is. Even if you HAVE NOT SEEN IT you know EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS! How's that for predictability? However the awful writing the dreadful acting and the predictable predictability are NOT what's worst about this film. The real repulsiveness comes from the shameless way this film takes from the TRUE DISASTER of 9112001 right down to people putting up photos of loved ones on billboards along the sidewalk.

The acting fits perfectly with the dialog it is equally horrendous. And the predictability factor is off the charts here's how predictable it is. Even if you HAVE NOT SEEN IT you know EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS! How's that for predictability? However the awful writing the dreadful acting and the predictable predictability are NOT what's worst about this film. The real repulsiveness comes from the shameless way this film takes from the TRUE DISASTER of 9112001 right down to people putting up photos of loved ones on billboards along the sidewalk. It's shameless exploitation and unwatchable. The CGI was wonderful but what an abject waste of technology. Don't see it. You've got better things to do.";

But this flick here isn't for everybody because if you can't stand Asian flicks than stay away from this.The way the acting is and the way characters are talking to each other doesn't add towards the easiness to watch this flick. Just see how the boss of the tower and the workers are handling towards each other. But on the other hand this isn't really a disaster flick it's more an ode to the fire brigades risking their life every day. Not that it was all that bad the effects used were sublime. And there is suspense throughout the whole movie. There was even the typical Asian humour to see. But at the end of the day I thought that it would contain a bit of those Asian gore in it but it wasn't. It's not a bad movie and you will have flashbacks to the 911 event like people jumping out of the building and when the tower collide well if you were all ready there on 911 you will have some memories.Gore 05 Nudity 05 Effects 45 Story 35 Comedy 05".

Forget that the movie is supposed to be an attempt to update a great Irwin Allen disaster movie from the beginning of the disaster movie era if it is that it is so only in a superficial manner.No let's take a look at the blackhearted ugliness lying at the center of this film. I knew something was really wrong the moment I saw the films depiction of the highrise...now just why would someone remake The Towering Inferno using a bad CGI building that looks exactly like a cartoon version of the Twin Towers? I soon found out.Because in essence this flick is poking fun at what happened in NYC on 911.The fire starts a bit after half an hour into the film because a sudden updraft somehow manages to catch a bevy of helicopters flying around the twin towered high rise to drop artificial snow during the fireworks display highlighting the huge welcome tenants party in the upstairs ballroom...and cause them to go out of control and strike the building.The scenes of the actual strikes include some that so closely depict the fire starting across the line of windows it's stomach churning.The scenes of people screaming and running violently evoke what must have been happening after the terrorists' blammoed that first plane into the Twin Towers....The solution at the end involves a scene supposedly shot from above the building...showing a tower collapsing down upon itself....My feelings upon seeing that much are indescribable. I hope this review is voted near the top so that others who had some kind of involvement in that horror lost people in it or suffer from the reactions many Veterans like myself have upon just remembering much less seeing it used in such a blatantly sick waywill be warned and stay away from it. I stopped the movie between 35 and 40 minutes in after seeing that yes these sick freaks actually were using 911 and advanced it to near the end just to check whether or not they kept it up and found that horrifically pointed ending. I'd like to spare anyone else that knowledge of what some people out there are capable of doing.This movie is not a remake of The Towering Inferno though it bears the same name as the book that movie was based upon. It is a sick pointed slyly vicious holding up of the horrors and losses in a comedified sort of gloat that frankly engenders an enduring negative view of Koreans.".

I suspected from the description that this was going to be a remake or at least heavily influenced by the Towering Inferno. I wasn't wrong and it also appeared to have some Backdraft and Ladder 49 influences as well. The version I saw was subtitled and I can help but suspect that some of the movie was likely lost in translation. I think this is particularly true in some of the firefighter communications. I thought some of the acting early on at the fire station was over the top but during the actual action sequences it was believable even with the language barrier. Another influence that can't be missed is the similarity of this incident and the 911 attacks on the World Trade Center. Some of the visuals were obviously inspired by the images of that day. The movie was well shot and the special effects were as good or better than the standard Hollywood movies of today. I saw the Towering Inferno in the theater in the early 70's and count it among one of my favorites along with Backdraft from the early 90's. But both of these films were pre 911 and it's interesting to see what a sky scraper disaster movie looks like post 911.".

	schema:headline " Even without Philadelphia Story to put it to shame this is too much artifice not enough wit";
	schema:reviewBody "High Society 1956You can see this movie as one of the last of the great silver screen musicals and running out of originality and verve. Or you can enjoy Cole Porter brought down to a middle class sensibility never mind the wealth of the characters here. Or you can just marvel at some great footage of Louis Armstrong and at the inclusion a black jazz band as a centerpiece in a big budget movie.So there are reasons to give this movie a try even though it is fairly slow going and a pale shadow of the original the truly great 1940 Philadelphia Story. Grace Kelly plays the leading woman about to be married and she lacks the cool stony quality that Hitchcock wisely taps and instead tries to be a lively witty physically lithe leading lady. Just like Katherine Hepburn? Yes except she's no Katherine Hepburn and it all feels a bit striving.Likewise for Bing Crosby who plays a laid back guy who happens to have a jazz band and who does a good swinging song with Louis and crew alongside. He isn't quite screen magicthat is he's no Cary Grant. Frank Sinatra is fine but he has a smaller role. Alas.And so it goes. Brightly lit with big flashy Technicolor set design the mood throughout is upbeat and fun and funny. And so it's not a bad thing to view. But if you take at all seriously the contention of one man interceding on the groom for his exbride whatever the Hays Code strategy it just lacks edge and conviction. Cole Porter doesn't let us down so there's always that!".

	onyx:emotionText "High Society 1956You can see this movie as one of the last of the great silver screen musicals and running out of originality and verve. Or you can enjoy Cole Porter brought down to a middle class sensibility never mind the wealth of the characters here. Or you can just marvel at some great footage of Louis Armstrong and at the inclusion a black jazz band as a centerpiece in a big budget movie.So there are reasons to give this movie a try even though it is fairly slow going and a pale shadow of the original the truly great 1940 Philadelphia Story. Grace Kelly plays the leading woman about to be married and she lacks the cool stony quality that Hitchcock wisely taps and instead tries to be a lively witty physically lithe leading lady. Just like Katherine Hepburn? Yes except she's no Katherine Hepburn and it all feels a bit striving.Likewise for Bing Crosby who plays a laid back guy who happens to have a jazz band and who does a good swinging song with Louis and crew alongside. He isn't quite screen magicthat is he's no Cary Grant. Frank Sinatra is fine but he has a smaller role. Alas.And so it goes.

	schema:reviewBody "MGM was pretty lucky to secure the talents of Bing Crosby Frank Sinatra Grace Kelly Celeste Holm and Louis Armstrong to get involved in this great musical adaption of The Philadelphia Story.Cole Porter contributed a great original score for this film with songs very specifically written to suit the talents of High Society's players. I do wish Celeste Holm had been given more to do than just the duet with Frank Sinatra Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. On Broadway Celeste Holm was a musical star with Oklahoma and Bloomer Girl to her credit but MGM didn't want to recognize that.For this film the story is reset from Philadelphia to Newport Rhode Island to bring in the famous Jazz Festival. Philip Barry's social commentary is toned down and a very partisan Greek Chorus is added in the person of Mr. Louis Satchmo Armstrong. Satchmo tells you right up front who he's pulling for to win Grace Kelly and he helps musically along the way.Satch and Bing have that classic Now You Has Jazz duet so successful was it that they did an album together a few years later. Bing Crosby during his life was crazy about jazz musicians and there was no one he liked better than Louis Armstrong. No one on the planet could resist that man's joy for living.Grace Kelly got a chance to bat 1000 in the recording industry. She was no singer as she would have freely admitted but Cole Porter wrote True Love specifically to accommodate her limited range and when she does the last two bars of True Love with Der Bingle she got a million selling record for her one and only platter. As for Bing he got his 20th Gold record and the only one not with Decca records. True Love was nominated for Best Song at the Oscars but lost to Doris Day's Que Sera Sera which boomed all over the charts in 1956. It was sadly Cole Porter's last opportunity to win an Oscar for one of his movie songs.Frank Sinatra got a couple of good ballads in You're Sensational and Mind If I Make Love to You but what he's best remembered for is that classic Well Did You Evah duet with Bing. Today's fans can't possibly appreciate the screen meeting of the two best and best known singers for the previous generations. A musical summit conference.High Society's tone is a lot lighter than the Philadelphia Story. The cast in terms of acting ability are not in the same league as Grant Stewart Hepburn and Hussey. But folks it is a musical. I doubt those stars could have carried off the Cole Porter score.You can't miss with a cast like this in either film for that matter.".

What I mean is that the story is so preposterous as are most Opera plots that it is best not to question it too closely and just enjoy the movie. Porter's music is sensational to coin a phrase and the songs are all well performed. Grace Kelly's rendition of True Love yes it is her  not dubbed is delicious and just adds to her allure. Isn't it wonderful just how sexy Ms Kelly is in this film? This is 1956 and there is no flashing of bosom or even leg  just her natural beauty. She spends some time in the bedroom with Frank Sinatra and improbably remains chaste. Frank the honourable man!I watched The Philadelphia Story again recently and was surprised how much of the script from that movie was retained for High Society. If you find the story of High Society silly it is then it is really the earlier film you should blame. The set piece musical numbers in High Society are absolute classics  indeed there isn't a dud. It's worth listing them and you'll see what I mean High Society Calypso Little One Who Wants to be a Millionaire ?True Love I Love You Samantha Well Did You Evah Mind If I Make Love To You Now You Has Jazz You're Sensational. WOW!When you go to the Opera you want great music good performances lovely sets and some sort of feel good factor. With High Society you get all this and more. It is played tongue in cheek how could it not be? and that is how it should be. Keep your Film noir or your Cinema Vrit  give me High Society every time!".

	schema:reviewBody "High Society is a terrific film. If you are the type of movie fan who doesn't comprehend the ENTERTAIN part of entertainment and is eager and willing to flaunt that ignorance in film reviews you will hate it. But if you don't mind it when movies may not end up with deep psychological messages or everybody dead or doomed to a life of misery you'll agree.I'm the first to admit that this musical may not be DRAMATICALLY up to standard with The Philadelpia Story but what musical could be or should be for that matter. The cast however is another thing entirely. As you probably know the first cast was nearly incomparable. Suave and tremendously charming Cary Grant the magnificent Katherine Hepburn and of course Jimmy who won an Oscar for his work and is never less than adorable.NEARLY incomparable.But if anyone can do it it's gotta be BingSatchmoGracieand the Voice. I find it hard to believe anyone in the world could possibly contest that but since there are such unlikely specimens out there I'd better explain. If there's a more magnificent marriage than that of Frank Sinatra and a Cole Porter masterpiece I'd like to hear about it. But even perfection can be improved when you add Bing Crosby a witty little tuneand some hilarious ad libs all courtesy of a few too many drinks.That makes up heaven which can also go under the heading of '' Well Did you Evah'' without a doubt the best song and scene in this film. But never fear there are other gems as well.Grace Kelly is terrific in High Society. The not quite yet Princess of Monaco is not only breathtakingly beautiful but adorable as well. Her drunken warbling of ''You're Sensational'' as her stiffly embarrassed fianc drags her through a crowd of very proper guests is hilarious and I can never keep from laughing during the scene when she meets Mike Connor and Liz Embrie also known as Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm. Louis Armstrong doesn't have much to do in the picture but what he does do is great. He introduces the film with a cute calypso number sings a marvelous duet with Bing and the way he say's'' End of song beginin' of the storyyy'' is enough to make him unforgettable.Bing of course can NEVER be anything but magnificent. He remains an American icon and all his talent charm and timeless quality are well displayed.He makes his easygoing way through some magical songstoo including two marvelous duets with his singing costars and of course that little 1 record he did with Grace.Personally I like Celeste Holm even more in High Society than I liked Ruth Husseywho played the Liz Embrie role in Philadelphia Story.She's funny charmingworks well with Sinatra sings a hilarious duet with The Voice and has a beautiful smile.  Not that the last thing mentioned matters but it helps.And nowthe best for last. I have been a Sinatra adorer for years so I'm more than a little biased but I absolutely love Mr.Sinatra in this movie. His singing is flawless and incomparable  especially in ''You're Sensational'' his charm and charisma even more evident than the considerable amount displayed by Mr.Crosby and he's pure style and ringading ding. Those blue eyes ain't bad either! Oh one complaint I've found about High Society is that it's outdated and it aged badly. I am 14 years old so if there WERE any reason to believe that I'd be one of the first to know it. It is NOT outdated has NOT aged badly and it's one of the most entertaining and simply fun movies I've ever seen. And that is as Satchmo says the...'' End of storyyy!!''".

Crosby is a class act who holds the screen with effortless poise and cracks the funnies with sparkling sarcasm. Sinatra is in knockout form.  Rarely has that legendary voice achieved the resonant timbre on display here.  Satchmo blasts out a couple of breezy jazz numbers and comments on the action like a latterday Greek chorus.The songs include five alltime classics.  True Love is a gorgeous duet in which Kelly unveils a tuneful if brittle singingvoice.

The showstopper What A Swell Party This Is has Crosby and Sinatra at their very best wisecracking selfreferentially as they belt out a gem of a song.  My personal favourite You're Sensational is beautifully rendered by Sinatra.

	schema:reviewBody "This film at first glance might seem to have all the makings of a great film with its main stars Sinatra Kelly Crosby as well as Louis Armstrong's singing Cole Porter's songs and Nelson Riddle's scoring. Which was why I wondered what in the world made this movie fail.  It came nowhere near as close to the brilliance of The Philadelphia Story as well as failing to even be a good musical.The script was not as tight as in the original.  It came off as being far too contrived and an overall horrible redo of the original.  They seemed to stretch the script a bit thin in an attempt to make the musical aspect of it seem logical and fell flat on its face doing so.The songs were not really that good in my opinion.  I think a good musical leaves you humming the song after you hear it or maybe even singing along of you know the song.  The songs had no such effect on me this time unlike a great musical like The Sound of Music or My Fair Lady.Perhaps the greatest disappointment was just how poor everyone's acting was in this movie. For one there was absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra or between Kelly and Bing Crosby.  To use my previous terminology everyone's acting seemed far too contrived.  The rest of the supporting cast was also highly disappointing especially when compared to the original Philadelphia Story CastGrace Kelly's acting was outright horrible.  She was excellent in Rear Window and in High Noon so I expected much out of her in this movie. Was I ever let down.  Sinatra was great in The Manchurian Candidate and fairly good in From Here to Eternity but gave a horrible acting performance in this film I also think his acting sucks in Guys and Dolls.  I think the fault must be the director's fault since I know all of the actors could have and have elsewhere done excellent jobs.I gave this movie a 4 out of 10.  I'd say stick to the original Philadelphia Story and look for a good musical elsewhere.".

I think a good musical leaves you humming the song after you hear it or maybe even singing along of you know the song.  The songs had no such effect on me this time unlike a great musical like The Sound of Music or My Fair Lady.Perhaps the greatest disappointment was just how poor everyone's acting was in this movie. For one there was absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between Grace Kelly and Frank Sinatra or between Kelly and Bing Crosby.  To use my previous terminology everyone's acting seemed far too contrived.  The rest of the supporting cast was also highly disappointing especially when compared to the original Philadelphia Story CastGrace Kelly's acting was outright horrible.  She was excellent in Rear Window and in High Noon so I expected much out of her in this movie. Was I ever let down.  Sinatra was great in The Manchurian Candidate and fairly good in From Here to Eternity but gave a horrible acting performance in this film I also think his acting sucks in Guys and Dolls.  I think the fault must be the director's fault since I know all of the actors could have and have elsewhere done excellent jobs.I gave this movie a 4 out of 10.  I'd say stick to the original Philadelphia Story and look for a good musical elsewhere.";

Some of the blame should go to the uninspired direction of Walter Charles who can't overcome what the great George Cukor achieved in the original movie version. Part of the blame is shared with John Patrick's screen play that might have been based on the Philip Barry play but what one sees on the screen is a dull attempt of movie making. Donald Ogden Stewart who adapted the original play gave that film a light and fun touch which in Mr. Cukor's hands and brilliant direction came alive throughout the picture.It's not fair to make comparisons but unfortunately the creators of High Society leave themselves wide open for it. Right off the start these stars can't compare with the magnificent performances by Katherine Hepburn Cary Grant James Stewart Ruth Hussey and the irresistible Virginia Weidler.Grace Kelly was an elegant actress who as Tracy Lord gives the role another interpretation but doesn't capture the spirit of the nononsense socialite she is supposed to be. Bing Crosby as Dexter has some good moments especially in the True Love segment in the yacht with Tracy. Frank Sinatra's Mike Connors is all right although we can't just imagine how he can be in love with Liz Imbrie. Celeste Holm who appears as Liz gave a tamed reading of her character.The best thing in the film is the prologue and the finale with the incomparable Louis Armstrong whose presence would have been used to put some sparkle in this subdued version of Philip Barry's wonderful play.".

Grace Kelly in her last complete screen performance surprises us with her comedic talents helped along by the script Crosby slips into the comfortable role of the guynextdoor that is all too familiar with his screen person. Sinatra showing some of his age sings adequately but seems a little distant and lacks the edge danger and sexiness of his 1940 counterpart.I might only add that the 3 principals seemed to lack that spark which validated their freewheeling around L.A singing songs about making love. On screen I did not feel they were as youthful and vibrant as seen in some of their earlier films.The direction by Charles Walters  an accomplished director of film musicals including Gigi Ziegfeld Follies and Annie get your Gun  supports the cast very well with various long shots of the mansion and sunny California. He is splendidly able to infuse the house with it's sparkling jewels and ornaments with a sense of grandeur merriment and delight so that it fully inhabits the characters and their kingdom.The scenestealer each time is Louis Armstrong and his band. While his interludes are not his best pieces to showcase the music is pleasant dreamy and fun. What else would you expect from this rollicking comedy? And how can you not love Armstrong? He was so adorable!It was interesting to note the audience's reaction to this film. Musicals are one of my favourite genres  I love them for the swooning and swinging numbers  however the audience did not appreciate it so much. There were even groans and boos which I found disrespectful  you must know it's a musical! when Sinatra and Kelly burst into dreamy love duets. I have to admit though that the transition of the songs in the film was not altogether seamless even choppy at times. At times it seemed like a selling point for the producers to capitalise on the musical craze sweeping the country during that period in Hollywood See Kelly and Sinatra sing! add name dropping and songs  lyrics that misrepresent Cole Porter's skill and wit as a composer.This is a fun film however deeply overshadowed by the original 1940 version and lacking Cuckor's razorsharp screwball slapstick. The pace is also slower however it probably compensates for delighting us with the elegant sets and musical interludes.I was also fortunate to see this film with audience and definitely relished hearing the viewers chortle along to the absurd story and zany characters.

But this typical 50's remake has its own charm. According to the time its in fullcolor and features a musical score. But on top of that the whole movie seem to be made with great fun by the complete staff. Grace Kelly as snobby upperclass girl seems to be born for this role and in my opinion it is much harder to play a good comedy than a good drama. You may be wondering why Grace is remarrying Bing Crosby he is not really attractive but he is an excellent singer and entertainer and matches the movie perfectly! The songs by Cole Porter are classics up to this day True Love they are shot beautifully and are a pleasure my personal favorite is Who Wants to be a Millionaire? with Frank Sinatra and the great Celeste Holm as the funny couple in this picture. If somebody is able to speakunderstand German I recommend the German version. I compared it with the original English version and in my opinion the German dialogs are much more brilliant and funny than the original ones!  As I already said in the summary The movie is bright lighthearted funny sparkling and refreshing like champagne on a summer evening!".

I never really imagined myself saying this but they just aren't as smart or sharp or witty as the original cast.  Poor Grace Kelly makes an ass of herself in her last film and poor Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm are largely wasted and completely mismatched.  The supporting cast particularly the mother and the young sister are also embarrassing.The only things that save this film are Cole Porter's lively songs especially Well Did You Evah? and the rumba number in which Sinatra and Kelly show themselves to be the only wellmatched couple in the movie and display some good chemisry as well as the one and only Satchmo's wonderful opening rendition of the title song The film can only go downhill from there and Now You Has Jazz.  Bing Crosby's likeable performance the only nonembarassing one in the movie except Satchmo's also helps.Maybe I would have liked this movie better if I hadn't seen The Philadelphia Story beforehand but then again I didn't love The Philadephia Story until I saw this movie.

And Louis Armostrong was arguably the greatest jazz musician of the last century I know  a great case can be made for Davis Monk Coltrane etc.Here's the but.So with all this great talent why isn't this musical remake of The Philedelphia Story better? Crosby Sinatra Kelly  Holm as good as they are are nowhere near the actors that Hepburn Stewart Hussey and especially Cary Grant were. If you've seen The PS it's hard to watch High Society without thinking of the original and how much better the acting was.And the biggest thing missing was the role of Tracy's younger sister. In High Society she shows up at the beginning and is hard to spot her after Sinatra and Holm arrive. Virginia Weidler was so good in The PS and I guess her part was reduced to get in more of the musical numbers.Right off the top of my head I can't think of a successful musical that was made out of a successful movie. Usually they are mere curiosities think Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in Goodbye Mr Chips so maybe High Society is as good as it can get when you have a favorite movie to compare it to. Expectations are hard to beat.Maybe it would have been more successful as an original musical goodness knows MGM knew how to make some great ones. Maybe it needed the Freed touch or maybe Walters was not up to directing such high priced talent. Whatever it was some spark was missing High Society.".

The result is not just worse than the original but improbably worse.  For instance not one actor  not even among the bit players  is as good as his or her predecessor.  How likely is this to happen by chance?  Off the top of my head I can count twelve roles the likelihood of them all being performed worse the second time round is about 1 in 4096.  Yes I'm aware of sampling bias I know that the only reason I'm making the comparison in the first place is that the original performances were better than average but adjust the figure to allow for this and it would still be impressive  besides I'm sure that a scene by scene or plot point by plot point comparison would yield similar results.ESPECIALLY the latter.  If you've only seen The Philadelphia Story you simply won't be able to believe how idiotic the story has become as a result of the hundred or so nicks and scratches it has received after passing through the MGM mimeograph machine.  Take for example Charles Dexter Haven.  His marriage with Tracy hit the rocks because  and this is the central moral of BOTH films not just the first  she was intolerant of human failings.  What was Charles's failing?  In the original he was an alcoholic.  This is a genuine failing and it makes both him and Tracy more sympathetic than they would otherwise be.  It means that Tracy had some reason to treat him badly that he's bargaining from a position of weakness that he has things to prove to himself as well as to other people that in conquering his addiction he has achieved something and that this is a minor point throughout the champagnelaced festivities he has an overwhelming reason to remain sober  he doesn't do so just because the plot requires it.  Well and good.  Now what failing does Charles Dexter Haven have in the remake?  None!  I mean did you really think the studio would let Bing Crosby play an alcoholic?  Tracy left him because he wrote popular songs.  Need I tell you what nonsense this makes of the story?Lazily edited and flatly shot in uninspired Technicolor High Society has nothing going for it but some Cole Porter songs.  They're wonderful but they're not enough. ...Are you thinking perhaps that I should just forget the original and think of the remake as a standalone work?  If I could I would.  I'm sure this goes for everyone here who has seen The Philadelphia Story.  If High Society had any energy or life of its own we could easily forgive it its failings and judge it as an independent creation  but it doesn't and we can't.".

	schema:reviewBody "High Society is a pale and flimsy remake of The Philadelphia Story. There's no lack of talent here but unlike the smoldering synergy of Philadelphia Story High Society is basically inert and trivial. For example Grace Kelly in her final screen performance is stunningly beautiful but really fails to make anything of the character that Katherine Hepburn inhabited so glowingly in the original. I kept waiting for the incendiary interplay that made Philadelphia Story so magnificent. It never happened. It was a mistake to cast Sinatra in the role for which James Stewart won an Oscar. Sinatra was at the top of his game crooning Mind if I Make Love to You? But as an actor he really wasn't up to the role. Sinatra's cool cat attempt to deliver one of cinemas most smolderingly rendered romantic lines  You've got fires banked down in you hearthfires and holocausts  is hollow and ineffectual by comparison.None of the principles in point of fact were up to this film. Even when singing Crosby known as the consummate crooner was really offensive in his murderous attempt at a jazz vocal on Now You Has Jazz. Cole Poter no jazz master himself but certainly not the assassin Crosby shows himself to be clearly deserved better.I don't know if I could have enjoyed this movie in a world where Philadelphia Story hadn't so luminously and memorably preempted it decades earlier. Perhaps with lowered expectations that would have been possible had Katherine Hepburn Cary Grant and James Stewart not been so glorious but what a diminished world that would be. And what a diminished movie this is.".

There's no lack of talent here but unlike the smoldering synergy of Philadelphia Story High Society is basically inert and trivial. For example Grace Kelly in her final screen performance is stunningly beautiful but really fails to make anything of the character that Katherine Hepburn inhabited so glowingly in the original. I kept waiting for the incendiary interplay that made Philadelphia Story so magnificent. It never happened. It was a mistake to cast Sinatra in the role for which James Stewart won an Oscar. Sinatra was at the top of his game crooning Mind if I Make Love to You? But as an actor he really wasn't up to the role. Sinatra's cool cat attempt to deliver one of cinemas most smolderingly rendered romantic lines  You've got fires banked down in you hearthfires and holocausts  is hollow and ineffectual by comparison.None of the principles in point of fact were up to this film. Even when singing Crosby known as the consummate crooner was really offensive in his murderous attempt at a jazz vocal on Now You Has Jazz. Cole Poter no jazz master himself but certainly not the assassin Crosby shows himself to be clearly deserved better.I don't know if I could have enjoyed this movie in a world where Philadelphia Story hadn't so luminously and memorably preempted it decades earlier. Perhaps with lowered expectations that would have been possible had Katherine Hepburn Cary Grant and James Stewart not been so glorious but what a diminished world that would be. And what a diminished movie this is.";

People  her little sister her mother her father her exhusband her fianc  walk up to her and communicate to her what a failure as a human being she is. Tracy is told she is hard virginal cold. Her father is really really mad at her because he left his wife her mother for a much younger stripper and Tracy didn't show him any warmth. So that makes her a  well you know the word. It's all so icky. The original play was purchased and tailored for Katharine Hepburn at a time when she was considered box office poison. She was considered too haughty too upper class not warm enough. So Tracy Lord  Katharine Hepburn  Grace Kelly is really beautiful and aristocratic and we all envy her for that and she is starred in a role where people give her a hard time for being beautiful and aristocratic. Ew! Maybe any of this would be tolerable if High Society were not so starchy dull immobile incomprehensible and dead on the screen. High Society is boringly staged. Actors pose flat on the screen as if they were in a stage play. Action is slow and unbelievable.High Society is meant to take place among multimillionaires. You could recreate the sets by shopping at a Salvation Army. They are simply tacky. Bing Crosby one of the greats appears old enough to be Tracy's father and this does nothing to add to the romance between them. His character makes no sense whatsoever. He's the millionaire grandson of a robber baron and also somehow personal friends with Louis Armstrong and a great jazz singer? This doesn't follow the logic of conventional musicals  Crosby  DexterHaven performs on a stage in front of his fellow millionaires. I don't think so.Frank Sinatra sings one good song and that's fun but they did something weird to his hair  is that ... could it be ... SHOE POLISH???!!! Grace Kelly is a very beautiful woman but she needs a good director  Alfred Hitchcock say  to use her. Watching her pose in fabulous costumes gets a bit old.Celeste Holm is utterly wasted. She and Sinatra have as much chemistry together as ... well ... as Celeste Holm and Frank Sinatra.Tracy's father is one of the most unpleasant characters ever written and he's played by a B movie actor who after this went back to his successful career as a crash test dummy.Skip it. Not all films from the classic era and featuring classic stars are worth seeing.".

The Inuyasha TV anime came out in 2000 as a production of an acclaimed company Sunrise.    The TV anime's got highratings and also won some awards.      Following the success of the TV series the first movie Inuyasha  Toki O Koeru Omoi  was released in Japan in December 2001.Memoumaru the movieonly character was a decendant of one great foreign demon that invaded Japan 200 years ago.    His anchester's power was sealed by Inuyasha's father.     With the help of a piece of Shikon no Tama that Kagome accidently broke Memoumaru returned his life.    He wanted Inuyasha's sword Tessaiga to break the sealed power so he could have an absolute power.     And that's how it all began...The story plays around the weakest points of the main characters Kagome who always felt sad that Inuyasha was still in love with Kikyou and Inuyasha who kept on having a nightmare about how his beloved woman killed him.     The overall movie is not much of a new plot since the climax is similar to Takahashi's manga works.    But that doesn't mean it's not a good movie.Toki O Koeu Omoi is actually a highqualitied animation with the carefullydone scenery forest trees  sky exciting action scene and nice background music that fits the story perfectly.     I especially admire the 'makeup theme' which is used everytime Inuyasha tries to make up with Kagome.     The movie also uses a 3D technique on the growingup forest which became more living nicely done!.The outstanding scene is when Kagome tried hard to refuse the spell of Menoumaru who tried to make her kill Inuyasha.     You can actually feel her pain!     Other mustsee scenes are those romantic installments 'cause this is the first time you will ever hear Inuyasha confess his feeling toward Kagome!!Though not the best Inuyasha  but there're still a lot that Inuyasha's diehard fans shouldn't miss!".

Years later when the Shikon no TamaJewel of Four Souls shatters a fragment finds its way into a tree and frees Hyoga's son Menmaru who wishes to take vengeance for his father against Inuyasha and become the next Lord Hyoga.The story is like a stand alone Inuyasha episode only its longer and has a better budget and animation which mixes CG with traditional animation. Only the CG hasn't aged well and clashes with the regular animation very badly which thankfully happens in very few places so it isn't that distracting. Everything that fans of the series including myself love is all here. The humor the romance the epic action is all here. The movie also touches upon the relationship between Inuyasha and Kagome in a couple of very touching scenes with great animation and emotional music. The film comes with either the original Japanese dub or the English dub. It doesn't matter either or since both are very good although the English version has sometimes bad voice acting especially near the end where the main villain sounds really bad in his final form.Its a good Inuyasha flick and its worth your time especially if you are a fan of the series.".

It's Menomaru the son of a demon InuYasha's father killed years ago. And he doesn't intend on taking over the world instead well from what I've seen he intends on committing genocide in a very badass way believe me.Now first time viewers if they watch the film first they might lost but there is a sequence where it does tell the basic story although rather condensed but it helps.

	schema:reviewBody "A fantastic movie. I love everything about it. Hell the animation is some of the studios best almost Myazaki Gibli quality.I especially love the two driving characters Kagome and Sango. Kagome though being the main character of the series she's really put to the test here and I will say that this is probably one of Monica Stori's best performances in the series.Sango's relationship with Kirara is pushed to the limit here. Its almost if Kirara is like that friend you have that is kinda mentally ill and this is sorta there violent breakdown. And Sango really trying to save her is so touching.There is a little nitpick of wanting a bit more Kikyo in there being she's my favorite character in the series but who am I to complain. Where as Sailor Moon was the anime of my childhood this series really treated me like an adult. I love the dark tragic backstories the love triangle and the villains are great. If you wanna start watching it this is a good place to introduce new fans. One of the best outta the four and defiantly in my Top 50 Films. 1010".

Hell the animation is some of the studios best almost Myazaki Gibli quality.I especially love the two driving characters Kagome and Sango. Kagome though being the main character of the series she's really put to the test here and I will say that this is probably one of Monica Stori's best performances in the series.Sango's relationship with Kirara is pushed to the limit here. Its almost if Kirara is like that friend you have that is kinda mentally ill and this is sorta there violent breakdown. And Sango really trying to save her is so touching.There is a little nitpick of wanting a bit more Kikyo in there being she's my favorite character in the series but who am I to complain.

Well while the plot doesn't differ from the series you get the chance to explore the relationships between the characters a lot deeper than you're allowed to in the series. The story is similar to the main plot Naraku's still alive and matters not in this movie. But you get to see a lot of stir between Inuyasha Kagome and Kikyo and the animation is much better then the series of course the sightings are beautiful and some of the scenes really touching. Yes it may merely appear as a long episode so those who aren't fan of the series may not appreciate it that much but all in all fan as I am the movie stands on its own and I truly recommend it to Inuyasha fans and those who simply enjoy a good anime film.".

Unlike the series the first of currently three movies strays from the Naraku plot and into another enemy.Enter Menomaru. A demon who's father Hyoga was sealed beneath the Tree of Ages by Inuyasha's father 200 years past. He fools Inuyasha into attacking the claw which sealed away Hyoga's power thus destroying it and releasing Hyoga's power. His power takes the form of a great orb. Menomaru allows himself to be engulfed into it thus absorbing the power of his father.Collecting the souls of every living thing Menomaru's power grows to immense size and soon he becomes reborn with near limitless power as the New Hyoga.Side note During all this Sango and Mirkou are fighting battles against Menomaru's servants Ruri and Hari who both are slainWhile this passes Kikyo sends Kagome to her own time as she was not meant to be there. Kagome and Inuyasha somehow manage to contact each other although 500 years apart. Inuyasha gets Kagome to come back to Feudal Japan.With the help of Kagome's arrow Inuyasha's Backlash Wave hits Hyoga killing him and earning them a Shikon shard.Overall this is very much like what happens in the series but with larger detail. One detail I didn't enjoy was the 3D effect on the Tree of Ages. It takes away from the overall picture. But in a grand total I give this movie a 9.51012 point for 3D".

	schema:headline " Refreshingly NonMushy Romantic Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant hearken back to classic screwball comedies in a very engaging if somewhat shallow romantic film that accentuates laughter above sentiment and succeeds wonderfully  even when it's not especially witty or gutbusting.Bullock plays Lucy Kelson a committed leftwing attorney with an immaculate Ivy League background who fights the good fight against the heartless developers of lower Manhattan and the outer boroughs. Complications ensue when she finds herself working for one such figure George Wade Grant in exchange for his preserving a Coney Island landmark near her childhood home. Wade's not a bad guy but he's frightfully dependent on Lucy for everything. When it seems possible she might at last get clear of him she begins to have second thoughts about letting him go.Two things I really really like about this movie. One is the chemistry of Grant and Bullock. Bullock takes to being the butt of assorted slapstick with a gusto rare for a gorgeous screen star. She seems to have inherited the Doris Day mantle from Julia Roberts and Meg Ryan though in a better way than either of those two screen stars. It's a pity she's since shown no interest in maintaining it. Grant plays off her very well in a role he could perform in his sleep  and sometimes seems to do just that albeit in a good way. He has a casual way with a line that reminds me of Roger Moore or David Niven at their best and shows he is growing comfortably into a solid onscreen presence after years of coasting on looks and charm. If IMDb.com is correct he got paid 12.5 million for this which if true is way too high but he is probably the one guy who could make Wade so enjoyable to the point where you're happy at his shenanigans for keeping Lucy by his side.The other thing is the NYC backdrop. There's some eyepopping visuals courtesy of legendary cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs like the bridges lit up like Christmas trees in the background while Bullock has a drunk moment with Grant aboard his yacht. Another scene features a helicopter shot of Manhattan by the Hudson with a nice nod at 911 that doesn't impose itself on the viewer but is there for the noticing. This was the first film shot in the city after the tragedy. You can compare Two Weeks Notice with classic romantic comedies like What's Up Doc? or Bringing Up Baby. Not that it's as good but the goal is similar in that it strives to entertain more than play with one's heartstrings.Alright the story is shallow. We never really get a sense of Kelson's duties with Wade except when it comes to being pulled out of weddings to pick out ties. Her absentee boyfriend is barely established. The supporting cast is not well developed except Robert Klein and Dana Ivey as Lucy's parents. Klein especially is wonderful. Alicia Witt is spellbindingly gorgeous as Kelton's wouldbe replacement and she plays wonderfully off the main pair but she's suddenly thrust into the role of the heavy simply for plot convenience and it's jarring. Too many other secondary roles are like that too.The script by director Marc Lawrence has its share of lame oneliners but it keeps a steady merry tempo that distracts from the film's shortcomings at least somewhat while focusing on its key strengths Bullock and Grant. Lawrence's direction is similarly solid. I like the little bits of business between Bullock and Grant like when they pick off each others' plates at Fraunces Tavern or when she refuses his offer of a sidewalk kebob calling it a flesh popsicle. The scene that sticks out most is of her at an outdoor party wearing a lovely tulle gown and a clown nose. This is one film that makes a serious point of being goofy and glamorous all at once and it works. If all romantic comedies were so committed to being entertaining it would be a lot easier for us guys to sit through them.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw 'Two Weeks Notice' some years ago and didn't like it much. It seemed like a passable romantic comedy. I mean the acting was overall good the story a little old... it just felt like it lacked something. However after having revisited it today I actually liked it a lot more than before. Once one is passed the first half hour or so I think heshe can really enjoy the film.What makes the first half hour or so annoying is it's dragging pace and Hugh Grant. His character just comes across as extremely needy and perhaps it's not Grant's fault but the actor doesn't add anything new to his role. This is the kind of role that made him a star but he seems to have forgotten that there are other genres outside romantic comedy. Perhaps he wants to stick to a safer formula but I wonder how long people will continue watching him in the same kind of films playing similar roles. Anyway after this initial half hour he does decent in the acting department as he shows George's growth. We see his He shares a good chemistry with Sandra Bullock.'Two Weeks Notice' belongs to Sandra Bullock and I think it is her acting and her character that make this film more likable. The woman is naturally beautiful and her comic timing is impeccable and it is no surprise that she's known as one of the finest comedy actresses and she's great in other roles too. she has some of the best lines and she delivers them with complete ease.I also loved the dialogues. There are some hilarious oneliners such as the barking chilli dog and the bobcat pretzel. After the dragging initial reel the story moves at a good enough pace and gets funnier. Lawrence's screenplay and direction are good as the end result looks polished but some editing could have helped to tighten it up.Overall I think this funny film deserves a second chance as I liked it a lot more during the second viewing. I'm glad that I chose to watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two Weeks Notice 2002Hugh Grant is funny. Sandra Bullock is funny. Two Weeks Notice takes full advantage of both and for a warm if someone canned romantic comedy it's enjoyable.The premise is twofold. First is the idea that Bullock makes herself indispensable as an assistant to an unbelievably demanding boss an precursor of the more recent The Devil Wears Prada though in this case Grant is also a bit incompetent. Then she has to give notice she is quitting. This makes Grant desperate which is always fun to watch.The other premise is the feelgood part where a community center with history needs to be saved somehow an echo perhaps of You've Got Mail. Bullock is a dogooder and a smart one and she finds working with Grant has threatened her idealism. In fact this is the deeper part of the movie if still treated with typical easy going slightness. I mean this is no serious commentary for sure any more than My Man Godfrey will really change our views about unemployment in the depression. But it helps to have a cause to root for.Most of all I came to love Bullock for her natural onscreen personality. She's so likable in her own offbeat way you come to support her view of the world automatically. And in this case that's a good thing even if you also understand how Grant's character is both a jerk and a lovable misguided rich man. Grant of course is his own kind of natural and the two are rather good on screen. They might not have chemistry the way you'd want the screen to steam up but they have energy or synergy together more like the other Grant Cary and some of his counterparts did in the old days.I'm tilting this review toward a feeling that this is a screwball comedy as in the the late 30s and early 40s and in a way it is though not nutty enough perhaps to really qualify. It does have the standard romantic comedy problem of two leads who would be great together if only a million things weren't standing in the way.This movie gets weak reviews overall but I liked it and don't hesitate to recommend it as a thin but enjoyable comedy.".

Every time a new one hits our screens IMDb is absolutely inundated with reviews containing the words boring and predictable.Most of the time these reviews are written by people who are just annoyed that nobody was killed or nobody fired a gun or blew up a building or whatever. GROW UP.This is the last time I'm going to say this but romantic comedies work to a successful formula which have worked well for seventy odd years and that is why they are successful they are not going to change them and we certainly hope they don't so everyone please stop moaning for heavens sake. Maybe your action movies are a bit same ol' same ol' but do we slag them off to you? NO. So CAN IT.Now my little rant and rave is over onto the film in question.Sandra Bullock is in my opinion the greatest living comedy actress alive today. She is sexy and gifted and has the perfect talent and timing to easily take over the mantle of stars like Irene Dunne Jean Arthur Katherine Hepburn Doris Day and more recently Meg Ryan as a true queen of RomCom.It's my opinion that in fifty years time Sandra Bullock will be regarded as a screen great like the great actresses mentioned above. She has the ability to adapt between comedic and dramatic roles with perfect ease making us cry or laugh with equal vigour. I suppose she is almost like a female version of Cary Grant in that respect. In Two Weeks Notice she is given so much chance to make us laugh and she fails to miss one of them. I especially like the part when she says she can also speak German and Japanese and then turns down an offer using both followed by one of her rye giggles....hilarious and clever.Hugh Grant never really strays too far away from Hugh Grant but again as in the case of Ben Stiller and Adam Sandler this persona is what has made him a star and that is what he successfully does. It seems however that in this film he does it better than in any other film before.It's a love story between a radical left wing lawyer Bullock and a capitalist heartless tycoon Grant.He's been using her for her intellect and she has been using him and his money for her own charitable organizations but when she decides to quit the last two weeks sees their relationship change into something neither of them seem to want to part with.The script is funny and fast paced and both are handed good comedy material to sink their teeth into. Hugh Grant is surrounded by beautiful women throughout the film giving him the opportunity to work his English charm school act and with another sexy secretary in the picture Bullock is given her opportunity to spar in her own inimitable way. The schoolyard type fight over the stapler is a great example and gutwrenchingly funny.An enjoyable film and one deserving pride of place on any DVD shelf. Incidentally check out the feature commentary between Bullock Grant and Marc Lawrence. It's very funny and shows that the magic between them poured right off the film and leaked into real life.As for one of the previous reviewers who referred to Sandra Bullock as FAT I lay my gauntlet at your feet sir and it's pistols at ten. You may like her acting or loathe her but fat she ain't.".

Yes she gets more than she bargains for and finally gives notice  hence the title. In typical Grant style he spends the rest of the movie trying to get her back. Sure his movies follow the same formula but they are just fun to watch.Beside that you get a great Joni Mitchell song Big Yellow Taxi as part of an outstanding soundtrack  another feature of Grant's films.".

I thought that the pairing of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock worked very well. I did not enjoy this movie for it's social significance that's not what I watch movies for. If you enjoy adult humor and can appreciate the nuances then you will find this quite enjoyable. It is Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant at their best. Some of my favorite scenes include the one where Sandra Bullock has eaten too much and has to go to the bathroom while they are stuck on a bridge in New York City. Adding the music Taking Care Of Business was really a stroke of genius. The Bobcat Pretzel scene was equally funny. The interjection of the appropriate music adds much to the results.".

So finally tiring of being treated like a Personal Assistant she gives her two weeks notice of resignation. But can the pair do with out each other? And is there more than a working relationship bubbling under the surface? For his first feature film directing assignment Marc Lawrence played it safe and got lucky with his lead actors. Whilst hardly setting a new benchmark in the ROMCOM genre Two Weeks Notice is however witty and not without charm. This is due in the main to the pairing of Grant  Bullock who play it perky and spark a chemistry so sadly lacking in many other modern day films of its ilk. By their own admission the pair got on great off screen and that is evident as the pair feed of each other to make the lightweight script work wonders. The dominance of the pair tho leaves little room for the supporting actors to breathe with many of them coming across as mere fillers. It's this that stops the film from being the great film that Bullock and particularly Grant's efforts deserved.Enjoyable light entertainment that could have been better if more thought had gone into the outer characters. 6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Writer and first time Director Marc Lawrence's Two Weeks Notice is a charming smart and genuinely funny romantic comedy with terrific performances by Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant.  This a great movie. Inherent in romantic comedies is a degree of predictibility.  Two Weeks Notice follows formula but Lawrence orchestrates enough curves character insight and human resonance to make it more than just formula. He also has the great chemistry of Bullock and Grant this is their medium.Sandra Bullock plays Lucy Kelson a Harvard educated activist lawyer who is hired by George Wade Hugh Granta handsome charming and seemingly shallow multimillionaire developer.  George hires Lucy as chief legal counsel for Wade Corp. for 250 K because his brother Howard David Haig the true captain of Wade Corp. requested George hire an attorney who did not attend Bimbo U.  Lucy swallows her idealism and... poverty because George also promises to protect her parents' community center.  Lucy is smart and not intentionally funny and soon becomes George's right and left arm he can't to anything without her consult.  This only amplifies that Lucy has no life or rather any relationships of merit... other than with George.  Lucy gives George her Two Weeks Notice.  Credit Lawrence and company when George finally accepts Lucy's resignation it is crystal regarding the unspoken relationship of the two.  Wink.  Wink.  Two Weeks never insults our intelligence however it makes us await for an hour and a half.Along with wit and humor Lawrence Bullock and Grant provide a a very human touch that resonates throughout the movie.  In a very well done scene on the rooftop of Lucy's parent's New York apartment Lucy shares with George that she never lived upto her mother's expectations.  George says that is different from people having no expectations.  This is where movie transforms beyond the opposites attract story.  It makes sense of Lucy's need to be perfect and the man that George could be that he is well aware of.  In it's own light hearted way Two Weeks looks at where you sell out where do you become a whore but in a nice way and where do you take a stand.  And taking a stand is never easy... even in a romantic comedy though it sometimes takes longer.Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant are magic together.  They are both smart and their characters' are also.  Grant as George is charming witty and playing someone who has honor and substance that are dimissed by all except Lucy Bullock.  Grant is masterful at hinting at a depth of character.  Sandra Bullock is beautiful smart and funny as Lucy.  She also stretches herself when Lucy drunkenly braggs about her sexual prowess bobcat... pretsel thing.  Bullock lends compassion and a whacky sensibilty to Lucy who scares men off by being too smart and too perfect but still not good enough for her mother.  Her Lucy only gets a clue when she hires her replacement a good Alicia Witt she is in love with George.  The exchanges between Grant and Bullock are so natural... like conversation spoken and unspoken.At one point in the movie Lucy has a breakfast conversation with her Dad a goofy and wise Robert Klein.  She asks him What if people don't change? The point is they will or they don't.  Kind of like loving someone is accepting them for who they are and for who they are not.  Be open to surprises.  Marc Lawrence's Two Weeks Notice is an excellent surprise. He along with Bullock and Grant have made a classic romantic comedy and more.".

The movie keeps you laughing from the witty remarks made every few seconds. It's part mushy chick flick part comedy a great combination.The Movie Two Weeks Notice stares Saundra Bullock and Hugh Grant premiered in December of 2002. The movie follows a mix match relationship between a strong willed save the community lawyer named Lucy Kelson played by Sandra Bullock and a high status business man George Wade played by Hugh Grant. The two in the beginning seem completely different but when Lucy goes to work for George to keep him from knocking down the neighborhood community center she realizes how needy he was and how much she couldn't stand it. When Lucy gives George two weeks notice George realizes that she is an asset to his company. After much arguing she finally gets out and then they both realize that they've fallen in love with each other. Since they were too stubborn to admit it it took a huge argument in the employee lounge to get them to let their guards down.I have seen many movies in my lifetime but this one is definitely in my top 10. The plot of the movie is easy to follow and there are no boring scenes due to the wit of both Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant combined.Two Weeks Notice is a great movie to watch when taking a break from life. The movie will keep you laughing while still being very heart warming. Two Weeks Notice will cause you to want to watch two times over.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sandra Bullock is one of my favourite actress's I'll give any movie with her in a chance and Hugh Grant is funny if given good material. So despite looking every inch the predictable romantic comedy I expected to like this.Plot In A Paragraph Idealistic lawyer Lucy Kelton Sandra Bullock quits her job working for demanding corporate boss George Wade Hugh Grant But Soon realises she can't let go quite so easily.Bullock and Grant have great chemistry Their relationship reminded me of Arthur and Hobson from Arthur if Hobson had been a woman and the first half of this movie is very enjoyable but midway through it sort of loses its way as it heads towards its predictable climax. Hugh Grant is in top form here Bullocks's Miss Cingenialty co star Heather Burns has a role here as is Grant's Four Weddings  A Funeral costar David Haig and Alicia Witt is fine too.

	onyx:emotionText "Sandra Bullock is one of my favourite actress's I'll give any movie with her in a chance and Hugh Grant is funny if given good material. So despite looking every inch the predictable romantic comedy I expected to like this.Plot In A Paragraph Idealistic lawyer Lucy Kelton Sandra Bullock quits her job working for demanding corporate boss George Wade Hugh Grant But Soon realises she can't let go quite so easily.Bullock and Grant have great chemistry Their relationship reminded me of Arthur and Hobson from Arthur if Hobson had been a woman and the first half of this movie is very enjoyable but midway through it sort of loses its way as it heads towards its predictable climax. Hugh Grant is in top form here Bullocks's Miss Cingenialty co star Heather Burns has a role here as is Grant's Four Weddings  A Funeral costar David Haig and Alicia Witt is fine too. As for BullockI'll admit from the off that I am bias. I love her.

	schema:reviewBody "If you seen one romantic comedy you've seen them all. And Two Weeks Notice offers very little in the category with any originality let alone lacks in spark. The film juxtaposes between the sugary sweet that it lacks quality to keep me enthralled the whole way through. And after its through you just forget about it without really giving much to comment about after you've watched it. The other unbalanced factor is that it has a great opening scene that has a potential to be something special only to get cheated out turning this lightweight film to a featherweight slug. Sandra Bullock stars as Luck Kelson a liberal attorney who opposes the destruction of condemned buildings perpetrated by heartless corporate shrills. The main culprit behind this operation is a Donald Trump like realestate superpower George Wade Hugh Grant. His purpose is make buildings to fit the modern spirit. Lucy has been dubbed as an opposer to gentrification but George sees her as a ignoramus who doesn't know the concept of progress. And in strange turn of events Lucy ends up working for George and is ranked as chief counsel. Her skills and determination rubs rightly on him. As the months progress Lucy finds herself an essential worker as she becomes his assistant rather than just an attorney. She becomes sick of becoming a pawn to his demands she signs in her resignation. But as she takes her leave she uncovers that the relationship between each other is way beyond that of boss and employee. Guys who take their girlfriends to see these romantic comedies have no real motive just to see two people getting to know each other as they progressively fall head over heels for one another well Two Weeks Notice is no exception to the rule. It seems that directorwriter Marc Lawrence already anticipates which viewers are coming to see this one. He seems so sure of himself that the romantic comedy formula is rubbed in our faces that fans of other genres will likely turn them away. In others it's what you see is what you get and if you can't accept it then too bad. But for the romantic comedy fans this film has its share of flaws too. The happily ever after ending is way too rushed and very forced. It feels as if you have a box of chocolates and you pick one out of the box and you are the type who wants to savour the taste. But instead of indulging in its richness you gobble it all down until there's not one left. That's what this movie's about the buildup to the climax goes way too fast it feels like you have missed it entirely. The film overall is just buildup and really nothing more. The main performers of this type of comedy may be capable of performing this kind of genre with their eyes closed but sadly the chemistry between these two veterans are nowhere to be found. They have their moments but very sporadically. The main reason is that Miss Bullock looks like she's bored out of her wits and to think there was time where I thought she had a hint of panache. Contrary Hugh Grant was excellent in his performance showing energy poise and a character that grows onto you right away. His delivery is as always very impressive and just seems to carry himself the way through whereas Bullock seems she's getting tired of performing in romantic comedies. But in the long run unless you're dumber than a bag of rocks we all know what transpires once all the smoke's been cleared. The path has been cleared out for the audience only to be sidetracked by the sudden changes to may look like a traditional romantic comedy by have the audacity to be labeled as a feature film. Lucy has a mysterious boyfriend who is never on screen. And her new replacement June Carver Alicia Witt makes a seductive move on George right in front of eyes much to her chagrin especially when they engage in an innocent game of strip chess. Two Weeks Notice is way too mundane to be labeled as uplifting and intriguing or virtually irritatingly repulsive. It's just colour by the lines and formulaic.".

Basically liberal lawyer Lucy Kelson Sandra Bullock also producing works in New York City in environmental law and her work contrasts with that of immature billionaire real estate tycoon George Wade Hugh Grant who owns a lot but does not know a lot. Trying to stop the destruction of Coney Island community centre which she knew in her childhood Lucy gets to meet George and he is looking for a new Chief Counsel to replace his old one Amber but she says she will still keep an eye on the centre if she accepts the job which she does. Soon enough she realises that this job is more as an aide and even the smallest thing he will call her about even in the middle of the night and it getting her increasingly annoyed and she gives him her two week notice that she will be quitting this is after he has an emergency choosing a suit for a friend's wedding. George tries to convince Lucy to stay as he feels like he really needs her and he makes sure that any other jobs she tries to get she doesn't until he finally gives up and brings in flirty June Carver Alicia Witt to be trained and replace her. Lucy left even after becoming jealous of the new girl and George actually keeps the promise he presumably made to not destroy the community centre and obviously she misses him terribly. In the end there is a bit of a petty argument between them because of their obvious differences of opinion and stuff but in the end they realise they have feelings for each other and George and Lucy finally kiss. Also starring Dana Ivey as Ruth Kelson Robert Klein as Larry Kelson Heather Burns as Meryl Brooks Four Weddings and a Funeral's David Haig as Howard Wade Dorian Missick as Tony Donald Trump and Sunrise singer Norah Jones. Grant does his usual English twit thing and Bullock plays her usual feisty and attractive character together they aren't really very convincing the entire film doesn't really convince you that there is any love story at all the material is boring at times ridiculous and mostly unfunny a bit of a pointless romantic comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting reading some of the reviews following this just how much the world has changed and how a simple and romantic comedy such as TWO WEEKS NOTICE can manage to offend irritate and fly right over the implacably emotionless heads of so many people. Nothing Frank Capra or Grant  Hepburn who would both have loved this movie ever did came off much better than this.I cannot recall two stars working so well together. Leaves NOTTING HILL for dead if for no other reason because of the obvious onscreen chemistry between Grant and Bullock. I think many would agree this is Hugh Grant's finest work to date. His interpretation of George Wade megarich kid and front for the blackhearted WADE conglomerate is at once likeable touching and the perfect foil for Bullock's single minded gogetting Corporate Attorney Lucy Kelson. The scene on the company yacht when totally inebriated Lucy outlines her sexual prowess to Grant is the undoubted highlight of the film.Predictable it may be entertaining it most certainly is and a reminder that a positively orientated and totally appealing movie is still possible without coarse language violence hardcore sex or a solitary digitised sequence.If you want to FIND a corporate or personal message in this work by all means look. The film is as subtle and as deep as a Big Mac. It has however NO pretensions and no aspirations to be anything else other than a highly entertaining 100 minutes of uncluttered romantic comedy.Firsttime director Lawrence has fashioned a remarkably fresh and creditable winner here. Supporting roles are all expertly filled also. Klein as Lucy's father Witt as her upwardly mobile corporate replacement and Dana Ivey as her concerned and singleminded mom...all hand in a fine effort.Throw in a great soundtrack fascinating open credits IF you look and an inspired short sequence right at the end and you have a film towers over much of what passes for romantic comedy these days!Some of you guys think Grant and Bullock can't act? yeah well they laughed at Christopher Columbus too!".

The scene on the company yacht when totally inebriated Lucy outlines her sexual prowess to Grant is the undoubted highlight of the film.Predictable it may be entertaining it most certainly is and a reminder that a positively orientated and totally appealing movie is still possible without coarse language violence hardcore sex or a solitary digitised sequence.If you want to FIND a corporate or personal message in this work by all means look. The film is as subtle and as deep as a Big Mac. It has however NO pretensions and no aspirations to be anything else other than a highly entertaining 100 minutes of uncluttered romantic comedy.Firsttime director Lawrence has fashioned a remarkably fresh and creditable winner here. Supporting roles are all expertly filled also. Klein as Lucy's father Witt as her upwardly mobile corporate replacement and Dana Ivey as her concerned and singleminded mom...all hand in a fine effort.Throw in a great soundtrack fascinating open credits IF you look and an inspired short sequence right at the end and you have a film towers over much of what passes for romantic comedy these days!Some of you guys think Grant and Bullock can't act? yeah well they laughed at Christopher Columbus too!";

Support from Witt Ivey Klein Haig and a few others is reasonable enough but the film pretty much rests on the bythenumbers performances from the lead two.Overall this is a fairly soso film that does just what you expect it to do without ever threatening to surprise or stick in the memory.

	schema:reviewBody "Most reviews will tell you what's so great about this movie and why it's worth watching but I figured you should hear the other side of the story.First of all a small note for Tolkien fans. If you thought An Unexpected Journey strayed a bit too far from the book The Desolation of Smaug looks like the script writers didn't even know there was a book. The movie tries hard to change the story wherever it can reducing fanfavorite chapters to 5 minute scenes and writing new content that feels out of place.But it's not only bad if you've read the book. I really wonder what the target audience is because it feels like it's written for 15 year old boys. There are random action scenes every 10 minutes and 'funny' decapitations every 30. The worst thing here is that the action comes at the cost of character development. You have a band of 13 Dwarfs and a Hobbit yet you rarely see them interact.Now I like Elves more than Dwarfs so I didn't mind seeing so much of them in this movie. But having them show up in every place to save the day feels wrong. Perhaps Peter Jackson thought his cast of Dwarfs wasn't good enough to create an enjoyable movie? Gandalf's scenes in Dol Guldur were an interesting addition in concept but they are just too slow. I feel his scenes mostly serve as an attempt to raise The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings' level of epicness. And that just doesn't work.The story is full of illogicalities. How does entering the mountain to steal the Arkenstone to unite the Dwarfs to kill the Dragon to enter the mountain work exactly?? And remember that heartwarming last scene of An Unexpected Journey where Thorin finally accepts Bilbo? Well that's all gone again. Even though he keeps outsmarting all the Dwarfs Bilbo is back to being an unappreciated 5th wheel of the party. And did the writers really think viewers would be so desperate for a love story that they'd enjoy an Elf and a Dwarf flirting it up? Their scenes feel forced and are painful to watch.Martin Freeman's acting is top notch again but sadly he hardly gets any screen time. He only shines in his scene with Smaug. Now Smaug as a character is awesome no complaints there. Yet most of his scenes are way too dragged out. There's a 20 minute scene with the Dwarfs running around thinking they can defeat him. Only at that point the movie already hinted at the only possible way of defeating him. Perhaps the worst aspect is that these scenes make Smaug look like an unintelligent creature. Dwarfs luring a Dragon around by going Nanananana you can't catch me! is not only silly and clich it's an insult to Smaug's character.Final complaint the whole movie builds up to a scene.... that's apparently going to be the opening scene of movie 3. Nobody in the cinema was sure if the movie had ended or there was just an awkwardly long pause when the screen went black.A movie like this you'll want to see no matter how good or bad it is. You can't miss out on such a huge release especially when it looks gorgeous in HFR 3D. But where I watched each Lord of the Rings movie 3 times in cinema watching The Desolation of Smaug just once was enough for me.In the end most problems of the movie seem to stem from the decision to turn the cute Hobbit tale into three epic movies that have to live up to the Lord of the Rings hype. It doesn't work.".

	schema:headline " The word you're looking for is reimagining";
	schema:reviewBody "I won't review the content of the movie in any detail but provide some thoughts about how this film should be approached. I consider myself a Tolkienist in fact I saw this movie on opening night because I secured a promotion deal with the local cinema I spent four hours until midnight writing people's names in Elvish writing! It is to be expected that many fans of of the original book will perceive this movie as a bloated garbled monster version of the written story they loved. It is important to realize before going in that this is not simply the movie of the book. This is Jackson's The Hobbit not Tolkien's and they are best appreciated as independent works. They represent different media come from different centuries and have partly different target audiences. The children's book was written before Tolkien had any idea of the grand trilogy to follow Jackson had already produced his Lord of the Rings trilogy and somewhat understandably tries to make the prequels resemble it in tone and scope.One could argue that Jackson's Hobbit trilogy when complete will set up the LotR film trilogy far better than Tolkien's simple children's book sets up the literary LotR. The change in tone from children's book to grand epic is VERY pronounced even grating for those who try to read The Hobbit after finishing LotR. Incidentally Jackson's prequel trilogy apparently will not spoil the LotR trilogy the way the Star Wars prequels give away important plot points of the original movies. When finished Jackson's six Middleearth movies can be profitably watched in sequence of internal chronology.To be sure Jackson's Hobbit trilogy is based on the 1930s children's book in the sense that the characters have the same names and visit much the same places in somewhat the same order though new characters and places are also added. Their basic motivations are also the same. But beyond that one should not expect much fidelity. There is hardly anything that isn't greatly embellished and vastly elaborated mostly so as to allow for a FAR darker tone and MUCH more fantasy action i.e. fights. The spiders of Mirkwood here approach actual horror as compared to their rather more childrenfriendly literary counterparts where we have Bilbo insulting them with silly Attercop rhymes.The wizards' conflict with the Necromancer of Dol Guldur which in the book happens entirely offscreen and is just briefly alluded to when Gandalf has returned near the end is here actually shown. This is understandable Gandalf would otherwise be completely absent for much of this movie. Also Jackson's audience will already know that this is the start of the war with Sauron and the allimportant Dark Lord could not well be ignored. Tolkien in his letters noted how Sauron casts just a fleeting shadow over the pages of The Hobbit in Jackson's movie the shadow is darker and deeper.Entire new subplots are freely created and added to the story. The Elf Tauriel and her unlikely infatuation with one of the Dwarfs is clearly meant to add a love story where the book has none and have at least ONE strong female character no concern of Tolkien's when he wrote a story for children in the 1930s.The continued survival of ALL the protagonists despite their endless brushes with death doesn't just strain credibility  it utterly and completely banishes and eliminates credibility. We are left with FANTASY action in the truest sense to be enjoyed for choreography not plausibility. If cats have nine lives a Jacksonian Dwarf clearly enjoys a threedigit number of lives.So viewed as an independent work is this a good movie? Technically it is nothing short of brilliant full of detail that can only be appreciated on the big screen. Smaug is hands down the bestdesigned movie dragon the world has yet seen. If I were a teenager instead of a ripe old 42 this wealth of fantasy action would probably have exited me no end. It is nice to see Legolas again even if he is not in the book. I liked the sequences with the amorphous Sauron. Poor Evangeline Lily would however look better without those silly ears which are simply too big and look just as fake as they are. Also I'm not sure the hintedat ElfDwarf romance adds much to the story. All things considered I'll award Jackson's reimagined The Hobbit seven stars.There were also seven stars in Durin's crown for those of you who can understand the literary allusion ...".

	onyx:emotionText "I won't review the content of the movie in any detail but provide some thoughts about how this film should be approached. I consider myself a Tolkienist in fact I saw this movie on opening night because I secured a promotion deal with the local cinema I spent four hours until midnight writing people's names in Elvish writing! It is to be expected that many fans of of the original book will perceive this movie as a bloated garbled monster version of the written story they loved. It is important to realize before going in that this is not simply the movie of the book. This is Jackson's The Hobbit not Tolkien's and they are best appreciated as independent works. They represent different media come from different centuries and have partly different target audiences. The children's book was written before Tolkien had any idea of the grand trilogy to follow Jackson had already produced his Lord of the Rings trilogy and somewhat understandably tries to make the prequels resemble it in tone and scope.One could argue that Jackson's Hobbit trilogy when complete will set up the LotR film trilogy far better than Tolkien's simple children's book sets up the literary LotR. The change in tone from children's book to grand epic is VERY pronounced even grating for those who try to read The Hobbit after finishing LotR. Incidentally Jackson's prequel trilogy apparently will not spoil the LotR trilogy the way the Star Wars prequels give away important plot points of the original movies. When finished Jackson's six Middleearth movies can be profitably watched in sequence of internal chronology.To be sure Jackson's Hobbit trilogy is based on the 1930s children's book in the sense that the characters have the same names and visit much the same places in somewhat the same order though new characters and places are also added. Their basic motivations are also the same. But beyond that one should not expect much fidelity. There is hardly anything that isn't greatly embellished and vastly elaborated mostly so as to allow for a FAR darker tone and MUCH more fantasy action i.e. fights. The spiders of Mirkwood here approach actual horror as compared to their rather more childrenfriendly literary counterparts where we have Bilbo insulting them with silly Attercop rhymes.The wizards' conflict with the Necromancer of Dol Guldur which in the book happens entirely offscreen and is just briefly alluded to when Gandalf has returned near the end is here actually shown. This is understandable Gandalf would otherwise be completely absent for much of this movie. Also Jackson's audience will already know that this is the start of the war with Sauron and the allimportant Dark Lord could not well be ignored. Tolkien in his letters noted how Sauron casts just a fleeting shadow over the pages of The Hobbit in Jackson's movie the shadow is darker and deeper.Entire new subplots are freely created and added to the story. The Elf Tauriel and her unlikely infatuation with one of the Dwarfs is clearly meant to add a love story where the book has none and have at least ONE strong female character no concern of Tolkien's when he wrote a story for children in the 1930s.The continued survival of ALL the protagonists despite their endless brushes with death doesn't just strain credibility  it utterly and completely banishes and eliminates credibility.

How can they turn a single book into three films and yet cutdown or skip or rush through loads of really good bits from the book? How can they expand the fake characters at length and yet the real characters are barely used?

	schema:headline " The Desolation of CGI  the Hobbit trilogy continues to disappoint";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw the movie in 2D because I hated the 3D HFR in the first Hobbit movie. I thought the HFR just made the movie sets look like sets instead of being part of the movie universe. I much preferred the 2D experience here and it was easier for me to try to immerse myself in the movie. Regrettably there were too many things that were wrong with the movie for me to achieve that. This movie had a budget of something like 200 million dollars over double that of any of the individual movies of the original trilogy. Where did all that money go? To that mostly horrid CGI? There was just bloody too much of it like in the first movie. Everything looks so damn fake with the CGI slammed front and center with no artistic attempt to hide its shortcomings. For example when Legolas starts chasing Bolg out of Laketown even his horse is made with CGI. Why? Couldn't you afford to rent one horse? The orcs were mostly made with CGI and they weren't menacing in the slightest. The few scenes with actual actors with makeup playing the orcs were far superior. Erebor looked quite good in general with its mountains of coins and treasures but the melted gold looked unbelievably bad. Many of the actual sets in the movie were very well done and I'm really puzzled why they didn't use them more. The CGI in LOTR looked far more convincing and epic the large establishing shots looked like grand paintings come alive. What happened here? I don't get it. It felt like I was watching a video game and I don't want to feel that way when I'm watching a movie. Granted the original trilogy did have a bit of silly looking CGI here and there but at least it was constantly grounded by real sets. There was also some really weird editing here too. The movie is already way too long and they still include absolutely pointless scenes. For example when Gandalf is climbing the stairs by the mountain and the ledge gives up the movie suddenly cuts to a sweeping shot of the mountain side. Why not just stay with Gandalf it would provide more intensity. There's many examples like this. In Mirkwood when Bilbo is snapping at the spider web they shouldn't zoom deep into the web with the camera. Stuff like this tells nothing and adds nothing to the film. This also takes time away from the character development. When one of the dwarfs oversleeps and misses the boat to Erebor I couldn't even remember who he was and why I should care that he was stranded in Laketown. Also the most puzzling and distracting choice in the movie was using that weird POV camera footage in the barrel scenes it looked so utterly different that it took me out of the movie completely. The action could've been cut down significantly too. There was no real context or meaning for most of it anyway. Also after Legolas has killed his umpteenth orc in yet another physicsbreaking and miraculous way you simply lose interest. He can apparently do anything. My feeling is that in the original trilogy the laws of physics so to say were merely bent somewhat here they're completely shattered. All of this may sound nitpicky but I'm essentially doing this because the movie didn't get me emotionally invested in it in a positive way at all.The movie wasn't particularly funny either despite its lighthearted source material I laughed much more heartily in many parts of the original trilogy. The Gimli joke was quite funny though. There was also absolutely no memorable music in this movie and none of it moved me like much of the music did in the original trilogy. I didn't get shivers at any point of the movie.It wasn't all bad or mediocre though. Smaug was magnificent and Benedict Cumberbatch did a great job voice acting the dragon definitely something to witness in a theater. Smaug's discussions with Bilbo were also great. Gandalf's venture into Dol Guldur was also interesting though that is mainly because Ian McKellen is such a fine actor that he can catch your attention with ease. The cameos by Peter Jackson in the beginning eating the carrot and by Stephen Colbert as the Laketown spy were fun even though I think they might've been too distracting had I loved the movie. The pacing in the movie is a bit of a mixed bag. The first movie had bad pacing because it was overly long without anything really happening. Desolation of Smaug swings the pendulum to the other end with endless action sequences pasted after another. Sure it's more exciting to watch but it was dearly missing some slower sequences to digest everything. I'm a massive fan of the original trilogy but the first two Hobbit movies simply haven't captured the epicness and magic of those movies at all. And if the Hobbit wasn't intended to feel epic then why make it into three movies? There's also something else I don't get. The original movie trilogy adaptation established what the LOTR universe looked and felt like. Is the Hobbit trilogy still supposed to happen in that same universe? I didn't ever feel like anyone was in any serious danger because they survive crazier and crazier encounters after the next and because of that there's no tension. This wasn't the case with the originals. Huge spiders were very dangerous in LOTR here Bilbo is just killing them off left and right. I just wish they'd taken much more liberties with the material and really placed this story into the grittier universe that was established by the original trilogy. Or maybe they should've done something completely different instead of trying to imitate the originals and coming short of them. Anything but this.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is so far from the story found in the book that Peter Jackson wouldn't have needed to get the rights from the Tolkien estate. I disagree with many of the naysayers who think this shouldn't have been turned into a three part series. There is plenty of story action and character development in the book to make three reasonable length films. The issue with how Jackson has handled this adaptation is that they have truncated most of the important elements to the original story simply so they could make up drawn out action scenes for the sake of action.The film immediately came off the rails in what should have been the queer lodgings chapter. I was fully expecting another fun scene like An Unexpected Party where Gandalf lures Beorn into letting a company of Dwarfs stay in his house. What we get is a rushed scene where the entire company barrels their way into his barnish house fleeing from Beorn and locking him out of his own house. Then without explanation Beorn is fine with all the dwarfs piled in his house just because he hates orcs more then he hates dwarfs. This was one of my favorite scenes in the book and I was really disappointed with how awful it was done.Next we get to the edge of Mirkwood where Gandalf seems to suddenly discover he needs to go to the south. In the book you get the impression that Gandalf with his great foresight planned to leave the party at the edge of the forest long before they got there. With Gandalf gone the rest of the company immediately become a bunch of morons who simply get lost in stupidity. The entirety of Mirkwood takes them less than 15min to traverse which really kills the feeling that it's a great and massive forest. There was no black river not once did Bilbo say attercot to taunt the spiders while luring them away from the dwarfs. The Elves come in to save the day killing the spiders and then take the company of dwarfs to their prison cells. No twinkling lanterns no fires in little glades that go poof when Bilbo or a dwarf tries to approach.They are in and out of the Elvin prison in the blink of an eye with no sense of time that it took Bilbo to wander around learning his way around scrounging for food and concocting his plan to escape. All of this was rushed through so we could have another action sequence of orcs chasing the party while elves chased them both but kinda helping the party of dwarfs. It makes no sense. Something that should have been done in a few cuts got extended to a 5min action sequence so they can show off their CGI.I could go on but I'll skip ahead to the last part that never happens in the book. The last 15 minutes of the film is a drawn out action sequence of the Dwarfs and Bilbo battling Smaug inside the Lonely Mountain. In the book the Dwarfs never engage Smaug at all. The long straight secret tunnel leading to the hidden door is not long or straight at all in the film. To top it all off the ending was cut as Smaug is flying away toward Lake Town. There is no battle no burning of the city no Smaug getting shot in the breast by Bard and thus falling into the lake causing it to billow up in a cloud of steam.In summary this is not The Hobbit. It is some film that Peter Jackson made up as he went along with what conservatively is less than 40 parts of the books story. If you are a fan of Tolkien you will undoubtedly be let down by this excuse of a movie.Patrick".

You should exercise your brains and imagination creating the images yourself rather than letting someone else imagine for you causing you to be stuck with the images from these mediocre films.Jackson seems to know nothing of the poetry of the book of mythological archetypes language and history nor the unique gentle fantastic quality of Tolkien's work.

You should exercise your brains and imagination creating the images yourself rather than letting someone else imagine for you causing you to be stuck with the images from these mediocre films.Jackson seems to know nothing of the poetry of the book of mythological archetypes language and history nor the unique gentle fantastic quality of Tolkien's work. Its very sad.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug is more of a bad Steven Seagal clone than an adaptation of wellread literature. The first film in the new trilogy An Unexpected Journey was very good with one problem I'll mention later. If the worst decision Director Peter Jackson made was to include Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly which seems to be the case for the professional praisegivers this film would be fantastic. However it just so happens that there's this little thing Jackson and his fellow writers forgot to do make sure the movie resembles the book.I'm sure most people who saw the first movie remember the leading villain Azog. Well in case you haven't read the book page 251 of my 1997 Houghton Mifflin copy states Bolg of the North is coming O Dain! whose father you slew in Moria. In the section on Durin's Folk in Appendix A of the Lord of the Rings it is stated that Dain Ironfoot who is supposed to appear in the next film slew Azog in the big Dwarf vs. Goblin battle we see as a flashback in film one. This means that the entire Azog subplot is just one big fanfiction. It is one thing to include the son of the ElvenKing Legolas even though he is not mentioned in the book after all is it so inconceivable that Legolas would be near his father? It is an entirely different matter when a character is included even though he has been dead for over 100 years!Continuing with our game of What is timeline consistency? we come across Gandalf. Gandalf ends movie 2 in a cage at Dol Guldur. Beyond the fact that there is no rationale for such a decision we know from Appendix B that Gandalf reports the existence of Sauron to the White Council and then takes part in the attack on Dol Guldur. After that battle he proceeds to save Bilbo's life right before the Battle of Five Armies. Based on this film's timeline and what part of the original timeline still remains Gandalf has but a handful of days to accomplish all that I have listed.My copy of The Hobbit is 271 pages long. The US edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is 310 pages. Why in the name of Eru do you need three movies for this story? I understand and would have gladly stood behind two films therefore allowing for extended action sequences and a limited reduction in content. Three films should be more than enough to cover the entire book but apparently not for Peter Jackson. Beorn is trimmed down to the importance of Celeborn then we watch a ridiculously long giant spider sequence then the dwarfs are captured for maybe three hours MiddleEarth time then we watch an overly long fanfiction chapter about Azog's friends being killed by our two elf heroes. Note that Bolg is able to attack the dwarfs because Jackson changed the escape from Mirkwood scene in order to allow for more combat. After our craziest bloodbath yet we have an overly long scene introducing another Jackson creation Bard the BargeSailer who apparently got mixed up with Bard the Captain of the Guard. You see the former makes a whole bunch of claims that are actually true about the latter. Why do we need to mess up the LakeTown sequence? If you guessed To set up another impossible bloodbath give yourself a vacation to a combat zone. This round of combat is only after we leave four dwarfs behind because one of them got the WitchKing's knife disease that Frodo got in Fellowship but this time it came from an arrow fired by Bolg who has absolutely nothing better to do since Azog took all his screen time. Of course Kili is saved by Tauriel Captain of the Guard of the Woodland Realm who somehow has the same healing capability as Lord Elrond HalfElven wielder of one of the three Elven Rings of Power and a direct descendant of the Kings of the Noldor. It is rather fortunate Tauriel is there because otherwise Kili would have to wait for the next movie to have his deathbed dialogue provided Jackson even sends Fili and Kili to Erebor where they're supposed to be. I'm all for the suspension of disbelief but this doesn't even make sense in the fantasy universe.And don't forget the dragon. In LakeTown the viewer is reminded multiple times that Smaug can only be killed by a special ballistabolt strangely called an arrow and only in one tiny spot on his stomach. In the mountain Bilbo points it out again. But Peter Jackson apparently pays no heed to the script with his own name on it and gives the viewer a 30 minute Let's Kill the Dragon Sequence. Take a guess who doesn't die in this sequence. If you said Smaug the Fire Breathing Dragon you are more qualified to direct this movie than Peter Jackson. I loved the Rings film trilogy and with the exception of Azog the first Hobbit film. This film though has almost no plot development almost no consistency with the timeline given by Tolkien almost no attention paid to its own script and entirely too much combat. I remember Jackson being criticised for the warg battle in Towers but that did not require any plot change except for the location of the death of Hama a very minor change and the whole Aragorncliff dreamthing which serves to heighten the tension before a battle that is done far better in the film. The warg battle helped to make a good fantasy film. This film seems like it is trying to see how many people can be killed before it gets an R rating from the MPAA. Deviations from the book are good if it enables better cinema but not when it allows for Let's Kill Everything We See The Movie.".

The plot is truly terrible and a mere shadow of the original book the HFR 3D serves to visualise most of the film as a cheap madeforTV soap opera there is virtually no character development and the CGI fight scenes are so bad it's just laughable.In AUJ I found HFR 3D passable. It didn't distract me too much and maybe even enhanced parts of the film. However in this instalment it was awful. The very first scene is almost unwatchable it's so bad and this is a theme that continues throughout most of the film. The character closeups are like watching a badly made TV show with all the limitations of costume and makeup clearly visible and the largescale CGI scenes are like watching a computer game intro sequence. It just does not work.The plot is only loosely based on the book. The great character of Beorn is just glossed over and the gorgeous Murk Wood is presented as a mere triviality. I was looking forward to a sinister spider scene but all that we got was some Disneystyle nonsense that was not in the least bit scary.The entire thing is conducted as if a child has written it... ...and then the dwarfs go into beorn's house and then beorn tries to kill them and then he's not bothered and then he hates them and then he doesn't and then we're bored of beorn and then they go to murk wood and then gandalf goes to find the necromancer and we don't really know what that is or why but just cos and then there are spiders and then the dwarfs are stuck in the webs and then they're not stuck anymore and then they box the spiders and win and then some really really good looking elves come along and one of them is legolas and he's not really a wood elf but we'll just pretend he is cos he's really really good looking and the other elf girl who's really really good looking gets the hots for one of the dwarfs erm yeah erm hmm and that probably seems a bit weird so then the dwarf tells her a story about the moon and then and then...And now for the the fight scenes. Oh my god. Please just stop it. Please. If I see Legolas surfing around like some deranged beach bum with a bow and arrow one more time I think I'll throw up in the theatre. Pathetic doesn't even begin to describe the nonsense that is on display here.And why when PJ or GDT or whoever started saying ... and then the dwarfs bait Smaug into lighting the furnaces and then hundreds of tons of solid gold melts in a few seconds and then the gold is made into a giant gold dwarf and then the giant gold dwarf splurges all over Smaug and then that's pointless anyway cos Smaug just shakes it off and then Smaug doesn't want to kill the dwarfs anymore just cos and then Smaug just flies off instead... did someone not just stand up and slap whoever it was very hard in the face and say No. In then name of Gondor I will not let you defile the work of the great Tolkien such?".

Unfortunately PJ has just made another LOTRmovie which has very little to do with the Hobbit.In my point of view the greatest moment of the book was when the dwarfs Bilbo and Gandalf visited Beorn. For the movie I just couldn't wait to see how PJ had tackled the big hassle Gandlaf had to introduce all the dwarfs to Beorn. In the book he had to introduce them two by two during a long period of time. Just to make Beorn comfortable with so many visitors. PJ left this wonderful scene and changed it to an action scene where the company just sieged Beorns house and didn't let him in. That makes the film story to something completely different than the book.Then I was curious whether the company would be served by animals as they are in the book. That could have been a challenge and PJ didn't take it but placed a normal cow and goat in the kitchen and living room.If you are around 13 years old never read a book and obviously not the Hobbit and love to play Grand Theft Auto  this might be a decent movie to watch. Otherwise skip it.The only positive thing with the PJs movie being so bad and so far from the book is that there is room for a REAL The Hobbit movie in the future!".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the first Hobbit film I must admit that I could have cared less about seeing the second and indeed it took me a minute to get back into it and I was grateful for the film giving me a 12 months earlier scene to sum up what I am supposed to be following. It wasn't that the first film was bad it is too expensive to be bad but more than constant action and movement with no consequences or realism to engage me really left me looking at a video game that I had no investment in and I say this as a gamer. I didn't hope for much better when I went to see this sequel and as Theo Robertson has said perhaps this helped me enjoy the Desolation of Smaug more.The plot has more to it than one encounter after another and connecting it to the later films was a good move that made me feel there was more content here  although I think that was artificial I will not deny that it worked. The action sequences retain the same problems as the first film which is that nobody ever feels like they are in real danger no matter how long the fall how low the odds or what is happening. The good thing is that because the film isn't one escape sequence after another I didn't feel this so often  although it is undeniably still a problem in these films. The characters were a little better than before although perhaps I was just more interested in them. Smaug in particular is a great creation  visually and stylishly just like the first film where my favorite parts were the still and tense sequences with Gollum so too here the high point of the whole film is where Smaug is toying with his potential victims and it is such a shame that this was not done longer.Visually the film remains a feast  although befitting the time of year it is a Christmas feast where everything is good but it is endless and eventually just feels indulgent and gluttonous. This remains the case because the film almost never feels like it was shot wholly on a location. I remember the LotR films impressing me with their natural beauty but here even a shot of people walking across a field seems to have been digitally enhanced and as good as it looks it does remove me from the film somewhat. Visual effects are impressive but it does really hurt to see Jackson leaning towards the George Lucas if we can do it then we should do it school of effects management. The cast do solid jobs  I liked Freeman and McKellan when they were allowed to be more than just special effects The dwarfs made more of an impression on me this time but the elves not so much  Bloom remains stiff while Lilly sports the only unconvincing effect in the film in the shape of her ears. Cumberbatch was strong as the voice of Smaug and I enjoyed Fry and McCoy in supporting roles shame the latter missed out on more time due to his Doctor Who efforts during the 50th anniversary year!.The Desolation of Smaug is a solid blockbuster lots of action a decent story and strong special effects  this is not the same as saying it is a great film though but it does still entertain. The story remain distant due to the invincible characters and consequence free but very seriously presented action which does prevent one being drawn into it. Of course I'll be there for the final film but I really do hope than they focus on danger rather than spectacle and build the tension instead of just increasing the noise.".

I remember the LotR films impressing me with their natural beauty but here even a shot of people walking across a field seems to have been digitally enhanced and as good as it looks it does remove me from the film somewhat. Visual effects are impressive but it does really hurt to see Jackson leaning towards the George Lucas if we can do it then we should do it school of effects management. The cast do solid jobs  I liked Freeman and McKellan when they were allowed to be more than just special effects The dwarfs made more of an impression on me this time but the elves not so much  Bloom remains stiff while Lilly sports the only unconvincing effect in the film in the shape of her ears. Cumberbatch was strong as the voice of Smaug and I enjoyed Fry and McCoy in supporting roles shame the latter missed out on more time due to his Doctor Who efforts during the 50th anniversary year!.The Desolation of Smaug is a solid blockbuster lots of action a decent story and strong special effects  this is not the same as saying it is a great film though but it does still entertain. The story remain distant due to the invincible characters and consequence free but very seriously presented action which does prevent one being drawn into it. Of course I'll be there for the final film but I really do hope than they focus on danger rather than spectacle and build the tension instead of just increasing the noise.";

The plot has almost nothing to do with the book. There are completely fabricated characters and there is NO character development. In fact I had to go stand in the hall for a minute because my brother  I were laughing so hard about the fact that the third movie could be 3 hours of the cast members literally destroying copies of The Hobbit and it would probably be a better movie than this. The last 30 minutes are completely made up insulting to Tolkein and painful to watch. I would actually pay more than I paid to see the movie to get those 3 hours of my life back. I am at a loss for words at how Peter Jackson did so well with the Lord of The Rings movies and then seemingly had a seizure while holding a pen and decided to call it a script and go with it. I think they thought that bringing back Legolas would help the movie but in fact they only detracted by going ahead  writing him as a bland character who is now instead of being primarily an archer a ninja swordsman of some sort. They also opt to attempt to squeeze in a love story instead of actual events that happened in the book because dull romance sells. If you love the book as much as I do and have any sort of positive expectations for this film you will be severely let down.".

He keeps making up pointless crap as an excuse to add more CGI and more fighting scenes. If you are looking for mindless fighting zero dialogue an overuse of CGI that would leave James Cameron shaking his head in disbelief then sure this movie is probably for you! However if you are looking for the same emotion and magic that the book brings out in you prepare to be disappointed over and over again.Beorn is in the movie for about a minute and has the eloquence of a donkey with autism. Mirkwood before the elves appear is barely five minutes long. Which means the spiders disappear before they even got the chance to appear and there is no Bombur falling in the water and nothing to lure them off the path they just get lost because they are extremely dumb dwarfs. Orcs are chasing them wherever they go and the barrel ride out of Mirkwood is a 20minute long scene where nothing really happens except a lot of orcs die and Kili gets shot with a poisonous arrow?. Then they bribe Bard into smuggling them past the guards into Laketown. Apparently Bards ancestor shot off a piece of dragon scale under his left wing so Bard already knows of the Dragon's weakness. No thrush has to tell him anything... All the dwarfs race into Smaug's lair and go on a ratrace in which Smaug is too brainless to actually kill anyone and when he has an absolutely obvious shot at it he suddenly has a change of heart and decides to let them live. Also four of the dwarfs are still in Laketown tending to the poisoned Kili and fighting orcs with the elves. Make sense? Not really no. The book has been torched and Peter Jackson has rewritten it the way it was probably intended as a fighterbook with cool environments cool people who say cool things cool dwarven caves and cool statues. The things I have pointen out are only a few of the many changes and disappointments from the movie. Who needs a good story with all this CGI?The acting is dreadful the dialogue is dreadful the CGI is dreadfully overused the plot is dreadful it's not the same as the book believe me. But the dragon was pretty cool. So therefore 210.".

Jackson seems to think that we like his storymaking over Tolkien's. He has used his gratuitously added action scenes from those movies as the basis for almost the entirety of this 3hour movie.There is maybe 15 minutes of this movie that is from the book. The rest is stuff that Jackson wrote and neverending CGI action shots that have such fast moving elements that you can barely tell what is going on and the characters perform feats that stretch belief so far that even the fantasyworld of Middle Earth cannot overcome. The character of Bilbo is diminished almost to a supporting one. The main characters of this movie are Tauriel and Legolas the former made up by Jackson the latter never appears in The Hobbit and Bard. The character of Bard is totally changed from the noble protector of Laketown to that of a ruffian on the margins of Laketown society. The dwarfs were portrayed in the book as being a little cowardly very greedy and bumbling. In the movie they are like a pack of Jackie Chan's with beards even taunting the dragon to chase them through the halls of Erebor to try to catch him in a trap. From a cinematic critique Jackson continues his habit of massively exaggerating the scenery vertically so that as the party is making there way up the side of the Lonely Mountain it seems like they are climbing the Matterhorn.I could go on and on. Bottom line is this movie is lousy. I have watched each of the LOTR movies several times I don't think I could sit through this movie for a second time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is my first film review and I am writing it down mainly because I need a way to get a load of hateful feelings off my chest... Firstly I apologize for the harsh review title for insulting is an easy way to criticize but it is quite an accurate way of summarizing this review and a manner of expressing my feelings. Secondly this is a long review but I hope you take some time reading it especially if you have the same sensation as the title expresses. Thirdly I am glad to see that a lot of people share similar impressions from a film that by far does not deserve three Oscar nominations and an 8.1 rating even though lately these are seldom to be considered valuable. Finally I will approach this film basically on its cinematographic aspects and less on its content or on its relevance with Tolkien's work for the disrespect to film as an art form is in my opinion even greater than the disrespect to the book  which is clearly out of proportion. However maybe the greatest scandal of them all is the one Jackson does to himself.THE THREE PARTSConcerning this decision diversified discussions exist. Many find it a dull idea because the book's content does not permit such a film length. Personally I think it is an interesting idea to involve other elements from Tolkien's creation of MiddleEarth Silmarillion Unfinished Tales Children of Hurin but Jackson totally ruins its potential. Instead of what he claims to do he mostly fills it with ridiculously long and comic action scenes an invented character  which happens to be really hot  and a cheesy irrelevant love story. These Hollywood clichs are the perfect recipe for capitalism the compromise between art and business even the complete neglect of art. What I find even more frustrating is how he then manages to make a 161 min. film with an overdose of fast moving cameras and less than one second during shots. Moreover I am still unable to distinguish the dwarfs from one another and most of them barely even have lines. It also feels like Bilbo is disappearing behind Legolas and Tauriel. There are nearly no emotional connections being developed between the audience and the characters compared to the LOTR trilogy where strong bonds of empathy are constructed. THE SOUNDTRACKIn An Unexpected Journey the music is tolerable although it certainly does not attain the magic of the LOTR soundtrack. However here it seems as if Howard Shore ran out of inspiration or does not find a way to bring the music to the front instead of letting it murmur in the background. And for Christ's sake why in the world would you choose a sissy voice as Ed Sheeran's for your end credits after a cliffhanger with a mighty dragon? Simply to expand the target public to teen girls and gain more profit.THE ACTINGActually I cannot remember any of the actors acting well except maybe for Martin Freeman. For almost all of the other characters a general failure is the unbelievable overacting which is sometimes almost worth crying for. OK the acting in the LOTR is also very theatrical but it perfectly fits in the MiddleEarth atmosphere and it is always convincing and emotionally provoking. However in this film almost every line is exaggerated and edited in a way the deep male voices sound 'really cool' think of Beorn and Thorin. I am even disappointed in Ian McKellen who throws some extremely overacted lines as well. A brief attention goes to the two love scenes between Tauriel and Kili. It reminds me of Jackson's The Lovely Bones which is maybe the worst film I have ever seen. I thought he would not dare making such a mistake again. I was wrong. I could not believe my ears when Tauriel started saying meaningless cheesy rubbish about the universe and it continued for at least five minutes. However that was not enough The scene where she is healing Kili's leg and an aura of white light appears was just making me sick. On the other hand Benedict Cumberbatch's voice for Smaug is very convincing. THE ACTION AND CGIA simple thing I don't understand about modern CGI is that it is meant to make look things very realistic but it often results in the contrary. There is a huge difference with the LOTR especially with the Orcs and Wargs. I also have the feeling Jackson rarely went looking for a good setting and he just added everything with CGI. There is no more time for admiration of the magnificent landscapes from the LOTR and even from An Unexpected Journey. The only CGI that blew my mind was Smaug's appearance. Another important thing is the action in which Jackson completely loses himself making the impossible combat experience which ends up in a very computer gamelike sensation. He forgets MiddleEarth is an imaginary world but with realistic physics. The river scene Legolas' and Tauriel's scenes it is not even worth discussingI could go on for hours but sadly there is a 1000 word limit. I hope you now agree with the choice my review title because Peter Jackson is a perfect example of one who is consumed by capitalism  what I consider to be a severe illness  and therefore does not take time to think of a worthy completion of his previous artwork. I find it really hard to imagine him watching his premiere and thinking he has made a brilliant piece of work.The Lord of the Rings really made my teenager years and I was really grateful Jackson existed but now he just ruined every single bit of respect I had for him".

	schema:reviewBody "After a disappointing AUJ I really wanted to like this film. Unfortunately I've now lost complete faith in PJ's magic. There are so many flaws in this film I don't even know where to start. From characters that are invincible fighting barehanded giant spiders or Orcs ! which removes all tension from the film to utterly incomprehensible and unconvincing scenes creation of giant dwarf gold statue in 5 minutes while a fire breathing dragon is on a rampage this movie is just awful. Dialogues seem to be written by a 10 year old and the behavior of the protagonist contradicts what is expected from them Why does the king of dwarfs threatens Bilbo despite their bond in AUJ? Why do the dwarfs leave one of theirs sleeping in the village? Why do the dwarfs leave so quickly the mountain once they realize that they can't find the keyhole?. The village scenes add no value to the story fillers and the love triangle is forced and unconvincing. Worst Smaug which seemed to be an eloquent and highly intelligent character in the first five minutes of dialog with Bilbo is then transformed into a stupid creature who can't find slowpaced and pudgy dwarfs in his lair. What a waste of material  Smaug could have been one of the best villains coming out of Hollywood. Now it's just a dumb dragon which likes to talk like a posh Englishman. The 3D doesn't add any value to the film contrary to Gravity and the CGI was poor why make a horse in CGI?. LOTR was more convincing. In the end neither my wife or I cared for any of the characters existing or new. This film was an insult to our intelligence. We deserved much better.I've put 2 stars. One for the first five minutes of dialog with Smaug only real moment of the film with some tension and one for the fine acting of Gandalf and Bilbo as usual.".

	onyx:emotionText "After a disappointing AUJ I really wanted to like this film. Unfortunately I've now lost complete faith in PJ's magic. There are so many flaws in this film I don't even know where to start. From characters that are invincible fighting barehanded giant spiders or Orcs ! which removes all tension from the film to utterly incomprehensible and unconvincing scenes creation of giant dwarf gold statue in 5 minutes while a fire breathing dragon is on a rampage this movie is just awful. Dialogues seem to be written by a 10 year old and the behavior of the protagonist contradicts what is expected from them Why does the king of dwarfs threatens Bilbo despite their bond in AUJ? Why do the dwarfs leave one of theirs sleeping in the village? Why do the dwarfs leave so quickly the mountain once they realize that they can't find the keyhole?. The village scenes add no value to the story fillers and the love triangle is forced and unconvincing. Worst Smaug which seemed to be an eloquent and highly intelligent character in the first five minutes of dialog with Bilbo is then transformed into a stupid creature who can't find slowpaced and pudgy dwarfs in his lair. What a waste of material  Smaug could have been one of the best villains coming out of Hollywood. Now it's just a dumb dragon which likes to talk like a posh Englishman.

This is too bad because they were good stories. Beorn Mirkwood Elf fires Bilbo and the spiders Bilbo and the dragon etc. are all abbreviated or simply left out.2. Developing sub plots which were only alluded to in the book. These added depth to the world around the story but fully played out they are irrelevant and obsessed with the LOTR plot. Radagast the Necromancer etc. are distractions and doubly so with their relentless focus on premonition of events from the next 3 books. This also assumes that the director has more interesting stories to tell than the author did. He does not.3. Adding characters and plots that were never in the book. The Pale Orc Legolas Tauriel dwarfelf romance etc. These force the plot to change distract from the story and are weak compared to the original. Again the director demonstrates that the author was a better storyteller than he is. Plus this allows for cringeworthy scenes such as the one where the hottiekungfuelfshewarrior saved her love interest dwarf from a morgul arrowhead with magic spells and herbs just in time to kill a bunch of orcs who ninjastyle invaded lake town. 4. Doing another Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom style roller coaster ride. This was cute in the 80s but is simply insulting at this point in time and particularly in this story. Does one of the great stories of the 20th century really need a roller coaster ride to make it interesting? The moment I saw the dwarfs sliding down to waiting coal cars I realized that I'd had enough. This was where I walked out shaking my head.I'm sad about this movie because I loves these stories and I doubt they'll ever be told in film again. This was almost as bad as the John Carter movie!".

	schema:headline " This is NOT Tolkien's The Hobbit";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie MIGHT make a decent typical action CGI cartoonlike modern flick by today's low standards but it was supposed to be so much more. I think I might have somewhat liked or at least tolerated it if it was a story cooked up by Peter Jackson without claiming to be based on the great historical tale of Tolkien's The Hobbit. But it claims to be The Hobbit and not Peter Jackson's Wacky Tales from Middle Earth so I looked at it against the true Tolkien story. From that viewpoint this movies fails so bad that it is hard to write a review at all. And it failed even worse than The Hobbit Part 1. Where to begin?.. The Dwarf Kili who looks more human than the human characters in this film you would think with PJ's love of special effects they would not have overlooked this. He doesn't fit and what is worse they have him playing puppylove games with a female elf who is not even supposed to be in the movie. This female elf has a very large and completely fabricated role. It's like PJ plucked the idea from the Twilight films where the girl is torn between the werewolf and vampire boyfriends only this elf is torn between the human looking dwarf and Legolas. Oh and Legolas wasn't in the real story either. His role here would have been OK if kept minor but an entire contrived subplot that gives him an action hero role is unnaturally injected into the story in order to give Orlando Bloom way too much screen time. I write this having actually liked his part in Lord of The Rings. Radagast is almost as bad as he was in Hobbit 1 and Gandalf is worse. A MAJOR snafu on PJ's part is that the one plot point that carries through all the real stories is the journal Bilbo started keeping at the start of Mirkwood that eventually becomes Bilbo's  later Frodo's life work is totally left out and this plot point is prominent in PJ's LOTR films and the book is handed down to Samwise. I could go on but anyone who knows Tolkien gets the idea. I loved the PJ's LOTR movies but I hate what PJ  crew have done with The Hobbit One more point PJ claimed that he used material from the LOTR appendix to get the filler to make 3 Hobbit movies but that's not what he put in the Hobbit movies. The filler is made up from the mind of PJ  crew not taken from the LOTR appendix. PJ must think he is better write than Tolkien. He is NOT.Edit Peter Jackson ruined the Lord of the Rings with this movie how? The whole of the beginning of Fellowship was Gandalf unraveling the mystery of Sauron and the Ring but now Jackson wants to spoonfeed every connection to the audience so shows Sauron to Gandalf in Dol Goldur thereby making the whole opening in Fellowship mute. The more I think about the Hobbit 1  2 they worse they are to me. If I had the stomach to watch them again I am sure there would probably be dozens if not hundreds of more errors in these hashed plots.".

	schema:headline " The worst installment in the series thus far";
	schema:reviewBody "About three minutes in to The Hobbit the Desolation of Smaug we find ourselves back in the company of our merry dwarfs a wizard and a hobbit as they yet again find themselves fleeing from Azog the incompetent orc who is attempting to kill them. The scene is fast action packed and not particularly exciting. When the scene is finally at an end we are served with some forgettable dialog where the company discusses the danger they are in accompanied by some dramatic background music. It's a sign of things to come. This is basically how you will spend the next 150 minutes or so long drawn out action scene short futile discussion with dramatic background score new drawn out action scene. Throughout the movie I found myself desperately searching for moments of silence. Scenes that would allow the audience a break from this video game like narrative but it was almost never to be found. Now let me shoot in that I like to enjoy brainless action in movies and video games for that matter but that doesn't mean that it's right for this movie. The Hobbit is an adventure film and should play out like fairy tale. But this fairy tale suffers from a lack of restraint. It has too much action and amazingly too much score. It has never been an annoyance in the past but really does every piece of dialog have to be accompanied by score? The source material for this film the passages of the book which describe the long walk through Mirkwood forest the escape from the elves and the arrival in Lake town are some of the funniest most memorable and imaginative from the entire book. To my disappointment all the charming little scenes where Bilbo runs around invisible with his ring to help the dwarfs out of new trouble are cut short and hastily rushed through. You get the feeling that the director is short on time and has to get it over quickly but to make room for what exactly? How on earth is it that a trilogy consisting of three 160 minute films all based on a short book doesn't have the time to fully delve in to the most memorable passages from said book? Especially when these passages would have given the film some much needed pacing and comical relief. The answer came towards the end. The reason for why the film needed to move quickly was to make room for new elaborate and drawn out action scenes  all of them completely unnecessary for the plot. Now I am no Tolkien purist and I don't mind a little creative freedom if it serves a purpose. In the Desolation of Smaug the only purpose seems to have been to satisfy anxious producers that the film would have enough orc on dwarfelfhuman action which they obviously see as the only factor that made the three first films a success. There are no peaks and valleys. Only a succession of ever higher peaks. Every scene seems more action packed or dramatic than the next with hardly any humor at all leaving us completely numb to everything that happens. The criticism is one I could also direct at the first Hobbit movie but it was nowhere near as unrestrained as this one. The Desolation of Smaug is more related to Peter Jackson's King Kong than the original trilogy and one is left to wonder how the Fellowship of the Ring would have looked like if it had been made with the same creative philosophy as the Desolation of Smaug. In all likelihood the most charming scenes would have been cut short to make room for an hourlong battle in Moria. Let us only hope that the next film manages to show some restraint in the build up the battle of the five armies. The only redeeming qualities in this film are the set pieces which have been wonderfully put together in the same manner of which we have come to expect from the previous films. The polish and color filters could have been toned down a bit but visually the film is still a masterpiece.".

How can you possibly mess that up when you start making a film adaptation with abundant resources? Well let me tell you how they managed.Poor J.R.R. Tolkien he's probably spinning wildly in his grave right now. The man that you could with justification call an absolute perfectionist when it comes to the presentation of his work would have never approved of this silly bore fest. Honestly during some of the fight scenes I was expecting Graham Chapman as Colonel to come on to the screen and tell us exactly how silly it was that we just saw. An Unexpected Journey was promising enough to assume that the trilogy would probably not be a complete flop after all but Desolation of Smaug is where everything goes wrong. There's little left to redeem in the end.OK the bottom of the barrel first fight scenes. In Lord of the Rings trilogy fight scenes passed two critical tests they were at least if you exclude Legolas somewhat realistic and they served a purpose from the viewpoint of the story. Here we have none of that. Legolas is back with sillier stunts than ever but that's not all. This time EVERYONE is doing silly stunts except the orcs of course who are there solely to get hit usually in the groin by an axe that has just passed through several pairs of hands of dwarfs that are going down rapids in bouncing shaky barrels that somehow refuse to sink despite taking in water all the time. Another thing whenever a central character is threatened in any way you'll soon learn to ask yourself two questions which part of the baddies' body is the arrow going to pierce and who will shoot it? Need I even talk about the absurd love story between one of the dwarfs and the elven warrior played by Evangeline Lily? It's probably enough if I say it's one of the most forced and implausible love stories ever put on screen. Besides from this romance that kick starts immediately without a viable reason everything in this movie is so drawn out and slow that Bilbo's quote from Lord of the Rings fits perfectly. You wait and wait for something meaningful to happen and when it finally does. It. Goes. On. For. Ages. There are good things as well most notably Martin Freeman does good job as Bilbo and Benedict Cumberbatch is phenomenal as the voice of Smaug. Unfortunately with a script like this even talented actors can only do so much.The script. Oh god the script. I refuse to talk about it. If watching the movie was this painful how awful must it have been to actually write something so boring? All in all this movie is bad. Really really bad. It's not because the crew and cast don't know what they're doing it's because they're doing too much of everything just to squeeze out as much money as possible from source material that would've been enough for one feature film and no more. Also the spirit of the source material is forgotten. This is no kids' movie this is a movie that tries its earnest to be Lord of the Rings without ever having a chance to achieve that goal.A friendly word of advice to you Peter Jackson since you clearly wanted to make a movie trilogy that was like LotR start filming Silmarillion next. There's enough gritty source material for ten movies for you there and it's all action if you so wish. Drop the silliness you have brought in in The Hobbit though.".

The first Hobbit film was weak but tolerable and full of atmosphere but The Desolation of Smaug is downright awful.I am not against making changes to a film's source material that is if it benefits the film or makes for a solid entertaining story. The screenplay here is a big mess with too many conflicting subplots which take away from the central story about the dwarfs making their way to the mountain. Why do we need that subplot with Azog? Or a bunch of needless tieins to the original trilogy? Or a silly love triangle which does little to contribute to anything? It's a shame that so much screen time is taken away from Martin Freeman who without doubt gives the best performance.The CG is especially horrendous and had me laughing aloud at several moments. The action sequences are so overblown and cartoonish. And why does Legolas' horse need to be CG?? Really? Does everything need to be a special effect? You cannot tell me they could not afford a real horse for just that one tiny shot! It's ridiculous.At least this film wasn't Star Wars prequel bad but that's about it.".

I don't understand how a book presented in three 3h movies can seem so rushed... The meeting with Beorn was quick with no tension no detail no nothing. The journey through mirkwood was dull a mere 2 minutes of wandering and then they jumped directly to the spider fight... The barrels escape came from nowhere. In the Lake town they were caught and they were gone. The search for the keyhole was stupid... Why the need of the light of the moon if they had a staircase which led to a wall smaller than one wall in my room where all they needed was to search a little for a hole? The story from inside the mountain seemed a totally different thing than the book... What was the story with the Lake chief? What is Gandalf doing and why are the orcs here better armored in the end than in LOTR? 2. Fighting scenes are overly exaggerated... Probably influenced by LOTR. They get overly creative with all angle arrow shots and creative decapitations by Legolas.3. The CGI is disappointing... There are a few scenes which seem taken from a video game. The orcs do not look real. There Is a scene where the orcs run over a lake bridge and Legolas follows ahorse when the riding doesn't seems at all natural. The best thing the movie did was to make me read the book again to remember the real details...".

Overall it is about friendship love of course but most importantly being alive in the true sense of the word. Experiencing novelty seeking and trying... not giving up.

Boy was I wrong well there are a few inevitable clichs but that'll be the least of the things you'll remember.This Belgium production won the Audience award at the European Film awards Best Feature Film at the Cinequest San Jose Film Festival and at the Montreal Film Festival it won both the Grand Prix des Amriques and the most popular film. Being from Montreal how could I not write a review about it. I was completely surprised by the film expecting some sort of comedy it is not a comedy.I knew none of the actors or the director but by the end of the movie and knowing then that the three key characters are not handicapped you can't but say 'Wow what talent' as their performances are so damned credible. The trio is made up of a quadriplegic a blind guy and a paraplegic who has some other terminal disease. They share the same healthy lust for women as any healthy fully functional man their age but have a life perspective only people in their situation can understand that makes them close friends. It's that friendship and how the three cope and struggle with life how they bond and how they care for and help each other much like second nature that the movie manages to capitalize on in a big way. The audience you will start seeing life from their perspective you'll get their humour and their frustration how some seemingly insignificant things to you and I are so wondrous to them when they experience the road trip.Much of that has to do with the nursechauffeur Claude the trio had to hire for their road trip. Isabelle de Hertogh plays that nursechauffeur savior she has a backstory as well and were it not for de Hertogh the movie would not work as well as it does.I don't wish to spoil much more of the movie for those who will be interested in seeing it but I'll add that the resort they had longed to reach is one that caters to people like them but could very well be any other classy sex resort or very fancy brothel in southern Spain or other parts of the world I could site and describe. In life there is drama meaning highs and lows and this movie takes you there. This movie is what many will call a gem I do.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was like the British movie 'Third Star' where they go in search of peace but in this movie it is totally opposite. It centers around three friends Joseph Phillip and Lars who are in the twenties. Joseph is a visually impaired Phillip is paralyzed and Lars got a tumour. They are all common in something like they are still virgins. They are looking for their first sexual experience so they plan all the way to tour Spain where the destiny for their desire is waiting for them. But what stand against them are their parents and of course the disease. How they overcome everything and reach their goal is what the rest of the movie gonna tell to us.If you read the synopsis of the movie you come to know that the concept was not the first time you have heard. It is the common theme in Americans teen movies like 'Sex Drive' and 'The Inbetweeners'. But the thing was the main three characters were disabled and that makes the movie special. Because of the softness of the characters the audience will easily approve the intense of storyline and saying 'let them have what they want'. Yeah that makes I too want to be like one of them then I can be approved to have anything I want hahaha.I think the movie was good. It was a fun adventure simultaneously light emotional tale. All these three guys wanted was to have the fun like the normal people before it become too late for them. There was also a fat woman in the story called Claude and she was the van driver who takes them to the tour. Her role was obvious and supported well to the main characters. She was kinda reminded me Melissa McCarthy.It was one of the best road movie. I thought I could see some beautiful places of Europe but the director had the different ideas. He exposed lots of character emotions than the places around them but still the beauty of Europe vastly visible. The tale leaves nothing for us to guess the end as expected it ends in a usual style. So if you thought it would be a tearjerker's movie it is not. The movie had many lines about adult stuffs that makes it suitable for them only. It is one of the heartwarming comedy about disabled people and their desires like many movies we had seen.8.510".

Which of us would normally expect to be entertained by the spectacle of three young men a paraplegic one with hardly any vision and one semiparalysed as a result of terminal cancer struggling to go on a holiday sex adventure? I have to admit that on reading the blurb in the Radio Times I thought this could not possibly work. It sounded like some sort of Inbetweeners effort in the worst possible taste. However as it was taking up time in a BBC World Cinema slot I felt duty bound to give it a ten minute test particularly as too little attention is given to foreign movies by our TV companies. That the film grabbed immediately and survived those initial scenes I can only attribute to the likability of its characters. Admittedly Philip the paraplegic the mouthy one of the three needed getting used to but his companions Lars and Jozef had those endearing features that make for good company on a long journey. But even Philip was to reveal a more sympathetic side towards the end. I suppose in a way it worked because it was a comedy that skilfully sidestepped the mawkish with each scene however embarrassingly uncomfortable for the characters at the time  the hotel bedroom scene where a key is mislaid or the misadventure where Jozef accidentally rolls down an embankment into a lake  tending to come right so that the overall feelgood factor was never quite dissipated. Claude the lads' overweight female chauffeur holds the whole thing together beautifully. She develops a bond with her charges as we do with both them and her. In the end their sexual fulfilment is what matters all round. Admittedly the scene where death finally catches up with Lars is terribly sad but somehow it speaks for the honesty of a film that faces up to the fact that life is a balancing act of laughter and tears for most of us.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pasolini freely adapts ten or so episodes from Boccaccio's fourteenth century collection of hundred short stories. He interweaves the tales of happy or tragic lovers naughty nuns and lusty priests naive husbands and cheating but quickwitted wives inept grave robbers and a young gardener who got more than he had bargained for with his own meditations on art life death and love. Pasolini himself plays a painter Giotto who observes the characters that inspire him to paint a fresco on the church's wall. Decameron is the first part of Pasolini's Trilogy Of Life which continues with adaptations of two other celebrated works of world fiction The Canterbury Tales 1972 and the Arabian Nights aka A Thousand and One Nights 1974. All these books have been known as distinguished and revered works of literature that belong to the immortal classics. There are probably so many big volumes have been written about them that it would take more than a thousand and one days and nights to read them.

They had none of the Hollywood glamor or classical features or perfect teeth and smiles but their faces are interesting original and real.Full of rustic comedy and innocence earthy humor and lust for life Decameron is one of the most optimistic and celebrating life films ever made.

	onyx:emotionText "Pasolini freely adapts ten or so episodes from Boccaccio's fourteenth century collection of hundred short stories. He interweaves the tales of happy or tragic lovers naughty nuns and lusty priests naive husbands and cheating but quickwitted wives inept grave robbers and a young gardener who got more than he had bargained for with his own meditations on art life death and love. Pasolini himself plays a painter Giotto who observes the characters that inspire him to paint a fresco on the church's wall. Decameron is the first part of Pasolini's Trilogy Of Life which continues with adaptations of two other celebrated works of world fiction The Canterbury Tales 1972 and the Arabian Nights aka A Thousand and One Nights 1974. All these books have been known as distinguished and revered works of literature that belong to the immortal classics. There are probably so many big volumes have been written about them that it would take more than a thousand and one days and nights to read them. They talk about love death the meaning of life and religion but first and most of all  they entertain.

Pasolini does as delicious job of weaving the mythical and poetic into everyday life. He uses real people instead of actors and presents sexuality innocently and sensually. Staying away from the sexual violence so common in films of this era and the soft porn haze we see in Hollywood films today. These universal stories are presented much the way they were written simply and earnestly. The effect for me has always been pure magic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pasolini is the only one of my cherished filmmakers who does not have a film in my list of greats a weird thing. I love how he makes films but the main narrative thrust as carried in the long arch is usually so obvious so extrovertly Italian exposing modern absence of purpose in Teorema human selfdelusion here that it seems like something we always knew. But he is a master of sculpting cinematic air and this is a truly intelligent work of the medium and not for any point it makes for sexual freedom or against religion.A few of the individual joys first because he is so joyous to watch. The faces he finds such astonishingly expressive Italians. they are not actors in the ordinary sense they do not mask deeply troubled soul in the coy way of puritans like Bergman. They are human sculptures each one seemingly handpicked as exuberant fresco of earthy toothless mirth. His sense of place is naked unadorned discovered unlike so many Merchant Ivory or Hollywood period pieces I feel like I inhabit this world. His camera again unadorned even sloppy at times but as revelatory as anyone's. In all these he teases the same spontaneous quality that is what gives his work a certain careless air but that is being carried by inspiration instead of fixating on appearance. As honest as it is vital because it was not excessively tampered with. He does not impose paint beauty from the outside it inwardly springs from air from the flow of tangible emotion in tangible space jolting us into direct experience. Herzog could do it while being magical few others. The film is a comicbook an operabuffa in its narrative but it's not without gravity that is life nor is this the same as that tired business of 'realism' favored by the unimaginative like Nolan.Where it really soars is in the overall gaze however pleasant it is the gaze that elevates this to required viewing for me.All you need to know about the film is that it is in the form of thematically linked stories centered in medieval Naples with rascals and scoundrels caught in mischief often sexual. It is both funny and poignant a film made for the same rowdy people it depicts. As said the deeper purpose of the work is so readily available show the marvelously flawed human being in all its buffonery and self delusion we may be inclined to think it 'small'. I think the problem is largely ours myself includedwe often mistake complexity for intelligence reason with words instead of seeing the formative fabric.So this isn't complicated in what it says but it is some of the most intelligent stuff I have seen.Look at the film again. In each story someone is being deceived as are we watching a film. In each story as in the overall film the lie or deception reveals a more penetrating truth about self. Various selves pursue truth linked to freedom from the norm sometimes against the restraints of the story sometimes killed by the story sometimes negotiated to be a part of the story. So the easiest thing to do what many crass minds would do is to emphasize the strongest emotion despair in one story hypocrisy in another and pull on that to draw audience reactions. We'd still have pretty much the same point human buffoonery.It's all in Pasolini's multifaceted expression in the first story with Andreuccio who came to buy horses the poignant ascetic lesson of 'thank god for losing your money' is uttered by two sneaky louts so registers as both guidance and deception in the story with the fake deafmute boy in the convent the head nun deludes herself with the nonsensical miracle but simply oozes sexual joy as she rushes to ring the bell in the story with two young lovers discovered the morning after sex by the parents of the girl there is obvious hypocrisy by the father but everyone in the end happily gets his heart's desire in the story with the illicit Sicilian boyfriend we have both a sense of genuine bonding in the grove among the boys and awareness of its duplicity.The apotheosis the most emblematic instance is perhaps the cuckold potter we get once more both the obvious duplicity being cheated on but also the ecstatic enigmatic laughter of the divine fool who is each of us.See Pasolini could point out social wrongs or just plain stupidity as well as Godard but he could not afford to be a sweeping fool. Remember he was a communist expelled from the Party in his youth because of his homosexualitythe best thing that could happen to him as an artist.What he does here is the same a truly gentle soul. He sketches very simple desires then bit by bit he challenges the simplicity of our logical leaps in dealing with them leaps over unfathomable soul. The nun's miracle is nonsensical but that is her way of coping with newfound joy. Who's to condemn her? Who not being able to see her ecstasy would be so dumb as to point out the fallacy of the miracle?This is real intelligence folks the foundation of it. Seeing through the illusion to the self that gives rise to it this being real freedom from the norm.".

And even if this dates back to 1971 the stories remain fresh and provocative as is and this is the height of Pasolini's vision.Many indicated this as erotic. Sure there is much of full frontal male and female nudity some of which quite stimulating which might be too much for some. But this ain't no erotic film. There are stories which have not erotic element in  and there are nude scenes which function as laugh scenes. Overall this is a multilayered shortstories film.

	schema:reviewBody "Film lovers know Andrei Rublov that Russian film about an icon painter. The beauty of the film comes in part because the filmmaker is on the same quest as his character and that quest has as its core the discovery of beauty. The interesting thing about movies is that they create and sustain a fantasy world that lives beyond any one movie and into which we assume each movie is born. That world has its own type of beauty one born of color and glamor and poise.Paosolini does the same thing as Tarkovsky but where Tarkovsky dealt with cosmic beauty and recognition this artist has simpler goals to engage with flesh to flow with the simple streams of ignoble daily motion and to discover beauty in that plain world.Oh what a terrific cinematic place to visit! This is a far from that collection of movie metaphors and beauty as we can go. There is no movie acting here. There is no external beauty. There is no recourse to familiar characters or representation. As usual he draws his source material from matter that is not only before cinema but before any popular writing.And he works with that material outside any movie tricks. Well he still has that Italian tendency to believe that the world is populated by characters and not situations or any sort of fateful flow. Just people who do things. Lots of little things usually associated with pleasure.So if you are building a world of cinematic imagination you need to have this as one of your corners. That's silly every one of us is building a cinematic imagination  we cannot avoid it. What I mean to say is that if you are building an imagination some of which you understand and can use some of which you actually want and can enjoy without being sucked into reflex...If you want to just relate to people as people and test how easy it is to find grace in the strangest of faces then this is your movie voyage for the night.One rather shocking thing is how the nudity works. In ordinary film we thing nothing of seeing two people humping and moaning nude pelvises grinding is the most hungry of ways. But we gasp when some genital is shown. Here the exact reverse is found no shyness about the obvious existence of genitals an erection even. A sleeping girl with her hand in her lover's crotch. DIsplayed as if it were in the same cinematic territory as the faces he finds.But when these characters lay on each other for sex we have the most prurient of actor's postures. I think this was done simply to avoid an automatic sweep into ordinary film ways. It has that effect anyway.I don't know anyone that chooses more interesting faces. Distinctly Southern European odd atypical faces.And finally there is the bit of his own story inserted the artist in the church. Creating scenarios of rich life. In the movie the most amazing scenes are those that have little or nothing to do with the story. There's a death tableau that could be the richest single shot I have ever seen anywhere.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

What I mean to say is that if you are building an imagination some of which you understand and can use some of which you actually want and can enjoy without being sucked into reflex...If you want to just relate to people as people and test how easy it is to find grace in the strangest of faces then this is your movie voyage for the night.One rather shocking thing is how the nudity works. In ordinary film we thing nothing of seeing two people humping and moaning nude pelvises grinding is the most hungry of ways. But we gasp when some genital is shown. Here the exact reverse is found no shyness about the obvious existence of genitals an erection even. A sleeping girl with her hand in her lover's crotch. DIsplayed as if it were in the same cinematic territory as the faces he finds.But when these characters lay on each other for sex we have the most prurient of actor's postures. I think this was done simply to avoid an automatic sweep into ordinary film ways. It has that effect anyway.I don't know anyone that chooses more interesting faces. Distinctly Southern European odd atypical faces.And finally there is the bit of his own story inserted the artist in the church. Creating scenarios of rich life. In the movie the most amazing scenes are those that have little or nothing to do with the story. There's a death tableau that could be the richest single shot I have ever seen anywhere.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.";

I'm not a great fan of Pasolini. However this movie is more or less successful in depicting a series of funny situations related with erotic entanglements. Its merit is more due to the narrative form than to the stories itselves some them less funny than others. But the composition of the successive scenes develops in a series of pictures full of colour and movement portraying the people in the streets in a realistic way showing popular types such as peasants merchants priests nuns etc. most of them with no makeup at all which contributes to create a vivid atmosphere that really puts us in the middle of a mediaeval scenery.

	schema:reviewBody "There are at least hundreds of reasons why I like Il Decameron so unbelievably much a film that in retrospect always feels like a whole night of various kinds of wonderful dreams. First of all there is this incredible variety of faces and characters in those stories and episodes that are both alternating comic and tragic. I especially love the episodes with the three brothers and their poor sister the one with two nightingales on the roof top the side plot with Franco Citti and of course the selfironic part which Pasolini plays himself. I also like the two big long shots  la Bosch and Giotto with my woman Silvana Mangano as Madonna in the latter. I like the film's rich choral fresco the joyful and sensual atmosphere which surrounds the often bitter fate of the characters the transformation of literary and cinematic material to an impudently carnal and physical matter which consists of erections stomachaches hunger excrements. I like how the film laughs about life and sexuality and frequently meets death.There's always a constant circuiting movement where all characters are driven by the desire to improve their living conditions and to fulfill their wishes. While doing so they come to know betrayal and disappointment and therefore reckon with the reality of a world that is mean and unfair to them. There are the rich and the poor such as Lisabetta and her brothers and Lorenzo the smart and the naive the saints and the sinners the selfpleasing and the troublemaker. Those crowd scenes that often connect the episodes of all these swarming people and colours where always a special incidence of light a striking gesture of a figure an effective angle catches the eye are especially beautiful. And finally there's the cut with these smooth counterparts of environment and human figure of static takes and wild tracking shots i.e. the wonderful chase in the woods of Lorenzo and the three brothers with its sudden standstill the transition of the lightness of the play to an ominous shadow. And the shots of Ninetto silently dancing himself outside the church or Lisabetta hugging the plant pot with tears running down her cheek are the ones I will never forget.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something to be said about the casualness and the naturalness of the nudity in a film like this. No arty lighting techno music or attempts to glamorize any of it really. Additionally despite the rating the bulk of the film concerns people fully clothed though admittedly their stories do often have sexual subject matter. Director Pasolini who also appears on screen as an artist adapts less than a dozen of Boccaccio's fablelike tales into cinema vignettes their only connection being that they seem to take place in and around the same geographic area and in the same time period. The stories range from a hapless young man who is tricked out of his money but then accidentally finds himself wealthy again to a wife who tricks her husband into scrubbing out a huge jar while her lover simultaneously mounts her to a gardener who plays deafmute in order to work in a nunnery but soon finds out his job isn't as easy as he expected! Other tales include a priest who promises he can change a friend's wife into a donkey a young girl whose lover falls victim to her three overprotective brothers and an old couple who use their daughter's loose virtue to their advantage. The film's greatest benefit is its incredible earthiness. Wonderfully aged and distressed locations are used. The actors whose performances range from adequate to appallingly awful look for the most part like people who could have existed back then with just a few exceptions. The costuming suggests the primitive times the settings are authentically primitive and the filming is all done on location with mostly natural light. Few period films have fully given themselves over so much to the act of forgoing glamour and arty trimmings. Some of the actresses do wear modern cosmetics but most of them don't. The men seem to be either deliberately craggy and unappealing or deliberately hunky and virile. One deficit is the editing. The stories don't always have a clearcut ending but just blunder into one another without the benefit of segue. It doesn't help that not all of the stories' humor irony or morals translate effortlessly to a nonItalian viewer. Sometimes one is left scratching his head as to what exactly the intention of the story is. Still the film is worth seeing for the eyeopening way in which its material is displayed. For example in the nuns' story there's no imagining what it is that the gardener has to offer them. It's right there. Likewise the sexual arousal of the unfaithful wife's lover is evident without any particular fanfare. It's not a movie for everyone to be sure but for the curious it's likely that some part of it will be appealing. The director followed this up with two similar but somewhat more explicit films The Canterbury Tales and Arabian Nights before going for the jugular with Salo one of the most controversial and potentially offensive films ever made.".

Thus the ancient buildings and open landscapes often teem with crowds of people. The subject matter is of course very different but what fun it all is! The Decameron is to my mind the most original of the three. It seems almost to be without form. Stories start and end abruptly as if having milked a tale of its naughtiness the director is anxious to get on with another without the delay of a preamble. What I like most about the film is the sheer happiness of so many of the characters. Although some suffer embarrassing discomfort the buffoon who falls up to his neck into a privy most have a highly enjoyable old time the young convent gardener for instance who feigning deaf and dumbness has it off with a procession of nuns who in turn register the joy of having witnessed a miracle when he eventually decides to speak. But my favourites are the young couple who have a naked lovers' tryst on a rooftop. The girl tells her parents that she is going there to listen to the song of the nightingale. In a film where everyone is mainly happy even the parents register pleasure that their daughter has caught her nightingale when they discover the young couple nakedly fondling each other after what one can only imagine to have been the night of all nights of lovemaking from the blissful start we have witnessed.Was ever a young couple more perfectly endowed!

Also it has some really mean swipes at the Catholic Church.  Most surprising is the film's original X rating here in America was lowered to an R in 1991.  I'm not complaining but I'm really surprised and pleased that the ratings board did that.  It obviously got the X for the frequent nudityboth male and femaleincluding one shot with a man at full attention.  But the nudity is treated casually and in a wholesome sort of waynot as something dirty or to be ashamed of.  It's not exploitive in any way.  Still this isn't for children.So pretty good and worth seeing at least once.  A hundred times better than his dreadful Salo.".

Pasolini is probably the most humane of all of them even when considering Salo. The Decameron is a perfect representation of Medieval European humor. Perhaps those unfamiliar with Medieval literature should avoid it but all Medievalists must see it at some point. The stories are hilarious and the human stories are beautiful.

	schema:reviewBody "On a sunny day in Naples a rich young man comes to the market to buy horses. He is tricked by a woman into believing he is her brother and he ends in the tank of the toilet robbed and soiled. But escaping that trap he finds himself in the street and the scene turns fantastic. The women from their windows tell him to disappear and the men in the street tell him just the same. So there he runs away dressed in his underwear soaked in and perfumed with human feces. His descent to hell in a way. He hides from some nocturnal men in a barrel in some underground cellar but not for long. The men are thieves and they hire him on a mission and there the real film really starts. You will have to go and see it if you want to get the details. Who will die and who will survive that is THE question in this cruel world. In this film you have to go down into all kinds of holes tombs caves cellars. Pasolini has rewritten Boccaccio with the pen of Dante and he settles accounts with the church first of all that Italian church that is rich though doing nothing by doing nothing and exploiting the whole society. And society is then engaged in a simple game that of recuperating all they can from that church be it a benediction be it an absolution be it a rite of some sort but also some of the stolen money they carry in their clerical purses. So Pasolini makes his characters steal from the dead bishop and thus steal from his stealing surviving mates. Then they steal from the people in the street purse pickers they are. They steal some good cheer comfort and pleasure from the hypocritical nuns at least as long as youth grants the young man with enough potency and power and hardness to be able to satisfy the hunger of twenty nuns. They make false confessions not to save their souls but to look good in society when they die and save some trouble to their friends. And of course they steal as much pleasure as they can and absolutely disregard the idea that it may be a sin. Never mind the sin provided we have the pleasure. And this Italy is the Italy of all crimes of all murders and embezzlements. And of course they all manage to get through but Hell is the destination of them all and the vision of that Hell is superb and in the tradition of its representations in the churches of the end of the 15th century after the big plague the Black Death. And yet poetry haunts this film in the very excess it demonstrates. Excess in the language intonations that you have to enjoy in Italian of course but also excess in the body language especially but not only facial language. These Italians speak with their full bodies particularly their hands and their faces. Excess in desire and passion violence and hypocrisy. Even the morbidity of some scenes becomes artistic in its extreme sadness. And his vision of Hell is superb. Scatology transformed into a great art and that's just the point. The end of the film is the final vision of the fresco some master painter was painting in a church. That painter is the one who had the vision of hell but he transformed it into a civil and elegant scene full of majesty and nobility. He can regret the vision that was so beautiful but he could not render it on the wall of the church. A beautiful film though maybe slightly nostalgic and restrained which means not entirely freewheeling along the easy road Pasolini would have liked to be able to take but did not take entirely or in full light.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

Overrated because the supposed realism he introduces milling crowds crumbling architecture etc. are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave. In the pursuit of realism Pasolini utilized many nonactors but their deerintheheadlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly offkilter and inconsistent feel. And frankly  many of the toothless misshapenlyfeatured people are painful to look at.And Pasolini's Decameron is disturbing to me at least because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content. Not because I'm prudish or homophobic I'm neither but because the emphasis that Pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neorealism he otherwise espouses so it comes off as gratuitous and forced. One can almost hear him say OohI've got to stick a cute naked boy in this scene! At times it seems that Pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself regardless of what his audience might prefer.The disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolini's Decameron struck me as being a failing of Pasolini as a storyteller rather than being an aspect of neorealism. He seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction. Even the Pasolini's final line of dialog in the film which some people seem to find pithy Why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter?  to me it just makes me wonder why Pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way? In my opinion a far bettercrafted film and with MORE homosexual content is Fellini's Satyricon. It is also full of bizarrelooking people and absurd situations but it succeeds because of its pacing direction and strong storytelling whereas Decameron fails by those same elements.".

With in my memory an almost exact copy of the little church in which Pasolini himself figures as an icon painter a setting so good it was worthwhile using again. Together with Pasolini I also recommend the film 'Andrei Rublyov' to any viewer liking 'il Decamerone'.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand the hate for this film In my opinion Predator 2 is almost good as the original. It is my personal favorite action film it is not better than the first Predator 1987 because original Predator is everyone personal favorite action movie it is mine. This sequel in my opinion is a good action slasher movie as the original I love this film to death. It has badass good music score theme from Alan Silvestri. Has solid cast tons of action and gore horror elements in it. It is mixed between those two elements. The Predator Is an alien mysterious fierce adversary with supernatural power. There is a war in Los Angeles a rival Colombian and Jamaicans drug cartels declared war against cops on the streets during the hot summer.The Predator comes to Earth and descending upon a Los Angeles besieged by rival drug gangs in order to hunt for human trophies one of which could be LAPD Detective Mike Harrigan Danny Glover. I love the third act of the film which is more interesting.I understand Arnold is not in here but Danny Glover and Gary Busey did a great job with there characters. Directed was by Stephen Hopkins who also directed Judgment Night 1993 after this movie and he directed solid and well the film I have enjoy it. I love this film not much as the first one but I love it. I would put this movie right above Lethal Weapon I love this movie. I love the rivalry between two leads Danny Glover and Gary Busey they both acted together 3 years earlier in Lethal Weapon they were much better in here. Gary Busey as Peter Keyes FBI agent was solid excellent I love him in this movie. We also have Rubn Blades Bill Paxton from Aliens who did a good job as detective and Maria Conchita Alonso who also co started with Schwarzenegger in The Running Man. Elpidia Carrillo as Anna from first Predator 1987 appears in one scene.And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall who died a year after he had made Predator 2. Kevin Peter Hall did a solid respectfully acting The Predator in both of the films. This predator has more weapons than the first predator had. Kevin Peter Hall R.I.P. I really miss you. I love the designee for the predator by Stan Winston. This Predator used camouflage and incredible extensive combat skills. I love the horror elements in this movie in which Predator slashes people's heads and he skinned them alive. Predator kills 5 Jamaican gang members in the building. Predator jumps on a train and he kills everyone who is armed. I love the horror elements in which you see a skull on predator's spine. Predator is on a safari Lions. The Tigers. The Bears. Oh My... . I love that this Predator is tough alien and he is hard to kill he doesn't let him self getting killed.LAPD Detective Mike Harrigan Danny Glover is the best badass action hero who goes after Predator him self who killed his best friend. What happens after Mike Harrigan and the Predator appear in the future is a wild ride rife with macho action dark reflection on the nature of man and a few rays of hope here and there. Glover the hero and Hall the villain Predator make for such effective foes that the times they meet onscreen are completely breathtaking.Of course this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it and it's perfectly done. And the gunplay is delivered in perfect HopkinsGlover style as opposed to the slomo John Woostyle  you'll see lots of heavy automatic Shotguns Handguns and explosive weapons and you'll see them used well. The setting is not in in the jungle but it is in the urban jungle and I disagree with Arnold and everyone who say's it is a bad idea. So what if it doesn't take place in the jungle again. The city setting works in my opinion. The skulls of the different species was a great touch too.I love this film I always did it defines my childhood and I disagree with Siskel and Ebert and the Ending was great. I love also female reporters in this movie and police force.I have this movie on DVD and Bluray disc they are releasing this movie and the first Predator 1987 in Bluray 4k.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always loved this movie ever since I saw it way back in 1990 at the theater. Predator is great but part 2 is equally great. It may not be quite as primal and fast paced but it more than makes up for it with well developed characters a more detailed back story and compelling setting and a deeply developed story. If the predator wasn't in this movie the story set up would make for a great movie on its own.You may not realize it when you're watching it but the climax of this movie is nearly 45 minutes long! Starting from the subway shoot out the tunnel chase the streetroof chase the slaughter house fight the roof top fight that spills into the apartment building across the street the elevator shaft and finally to the Predator ship itself. It is a breathless series of action sequences strung together so well that it's almost astonishing to look back on it and imagine such effort was crafted to make this movie.This movie would never be made today. A sequel without the main character from the fist movie? A whole new setting? This would be seen as too great a risk but in 1990 movie studios were still run by creative people not accountants. This movie is a true unsung classic of scifi coming from an age when great care was put into genre movies that had strong stories good characters and dialogue that didn't sound silly and forced. Lines weren't meant to become oneliners they were just so memorable that they ended up that way.You can't see the eyes of the demon until him come calling. Okay Pssy face it's your move. Danny Boy.And of course...Want some candy?Granted those aren't as good as the classics from the first Predator likeYou son of a bitch! I ain't got time to bleed. Knock Knock. Stick around. If it bleeds we can kill it. You are one ugly mother fer.and of course...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Last but not least the music score from Predator 2 is one of the best ever. Alan Silvestri hasn't topped his work from this movie which has to have one of the most complex layered and just flat out astounding main themes ever composed for an action movie or any movie.And of course it had the cameo that sparked the whole Alien vs Predator phenomenon. If it weren't for Predator 2 god knows where we'd be.".

I'm not sure but I kind of think that I saw Predator 2 first which may be the reason but I think the true reasons are the followingI loved that the Predator has more weapons and the action sequences were more interesting.In this film they do a much better job developing and explaining the Predator.  This isn't just a crazy beast that kills things left and right. This is an intelligent being that is looking for a good hunt.  I love that the Predator doesn't attack anyone that he doesn't consider a threat or isn't a challenge.  I LOVE that he has compassion and respect for an expectant mother.I have to say there are only 2 or 3 little things that I didn't like about the movie but they aren't anything I can't deal with.  I wasn't too fond of the Predator being struck by lightning...sure it looks cool but don't you think that would hurt him pretty bad?All in all I genuinely LOVED this movie!  I don't know what is is about this movie that just doesn't sit well with a lot of the reviewers on this site but I loved it.  I REALLY hope that they go ahead with a 3rd installment but it won't be the same without Kevin Peter Hall R.I.P.. Thanks for reading.Cortex".

	schema:reviewBody "Series Note Although this is a sequel it's not strictly necessary to watch this film after the first. I almost always to prefer to watch film series in order but as the Predator films are not constructed as chapters in a novel there may be some advantage to watching Predator 2 firstnamely that the Predator itself is explained much better in this film so it might help viewers fill out unstated backstory for the first film.Set in a future 1997 the film was released in 1990 we're shown a Los Angeles suffering from both a mounting heat wave and mounting anarchy. Lieutenant Mike Harrigan Danny Glover is a rulebreaking shorttempered downtown cop. He works closely with Danny Archuleta Ruben Blades Leona Maria Conchita Alonso and recent transfer Jerry Lambert Bill Paxton all eccentrics in their own way and all but Danny equally rulebreaking. The film begins with a Colombian drug gang engaging in a shootout with the cops. The police finally manage to defensively drive them into a building but when they at last converge on the gang it seems that somebody or something else has finished the job for the police. More drug gangs are attacked and it seems as if there may be some kind of vigilante on the loose. But when a secretive government task squad headed by Peter Keyes Gary Busey enters the picture and takes increasingly odd actions it seems that something even more bizarre may be responsible a fact also given away by the film's title it's relationship to the Predator series and obvious shots involving the titular character early in the film.For my tastes Predator 2 is an example that breaks the supposed trend that sequels are never as good as their predecessors. I think Predator 2 is a brilliant film better than the first film by two points. This one is a 10 out of 10 for me.Let's get the more obvious comments out of the way first. As a horror and scifi leaning crime actioner director Stephen Hopkins and writers Jim and John Thomas have created a fastpaced exciting visceral film. This is a story set against burgeoning anarchy and chaos is a gangfilled urban environment and Hopkins appropriately never decreases the intensity of the filmwe barely pause to take a breath. While that may be exhausting to some viewers and the rapid pacing might lead some to confusion anyone with a taste for action films should love it plus the genremelding is accomplished without a hitch.The cast is quirky and excellent. Keep in mind that I have a taste for surrealism camp absurdism and so on so that makes me appreciate the acting in the film even more. I'm a big Bill Paxton fan. His performance in Predator 2 is a good example why. I also like Danny Glover a lot and he turns in a great performance. Additionally we have Gary Busey one of the odder actors in Hollywood just watch his comments on the DVD extrasa fact that to me always pleasantly comes through in his characters and the incomparable Morton Downey Jr. basically playing his real life television talk show personality is even present as a guerilla journalist.The music special effects and every other technical aspect are also excellent.But what makes this film even better is the brilliance beneath the obvious aspects. The Predator because of his goals is usually unseen hidden or camouflaged in his unique way and most of the time he's watching others. Thus Hopkins permeates the film with images of voyeurism hidden views reflections veiled appearances and so on. There are tens of brilliant shots through windows andor showing our primary visuals through reflections. The heat which not only amps up the chaotic atmosphere of the film also enables Hopkins to make everyone sweaty throughout most of the film. The sweat creates reflections. There is the regular presence of the media covering the story being voyeurs on the film's action. Sometimes we see things through their cameras. There are a lot of televisions and computer screens throughout the film. There is a subtle theme of voyeurism via public display of personal snapshots. We become literal voyeurs in the sexual sense by watching the film for one brief scene. The L.A. police become voyeurs of the task force's actions. During the subway scene much of the action becomes hidden because of a marvelous strobe light effect. I wouldn't doubt that if we watched the film with only this aspect in mind we would probably find it present in some way in every scene in nearly every shot.I know this film is sometimes panned but it would be undeserved. It may be a case of the film being too hip for the room. In any event you shouldn't miss Predator 2.".

	schema:reviewBody "Los Angles 1997. Gang warfare rages between rival drug gangs with the police caught in the middle. During one shoot out the police led by Mike Harrington Glover trap 6 men in a building. Before they can act the 6 are violently killed and stung up by an unseen attacker. As more armed gangs are attacked and killed in similarly unexplained ways the police realise that a new element is attempting to muscle in on the existing gangs. Glover and his team begin to hunt the new gang until they are joined by a FBI unit who seem to know more about the gang than they let on.This follows on from the first movie well  not a forced sequel picking up from the last but a different film that ties it's action in with previous events. None of the original stars return but the cast is full of name stars  Gary Busey Danny Glover Bill Paxton Ruben Blades Robert Davi. The plot is basically the same as the first  an unseen attacker attacks armed forces in the jungle  except here it's in the urban jungle and it's actually pretty good.The plot has the core of the predator doing battle but now has another string of the FBIGary Busey conspiracy which makes the film much more interesting. However all this is window dressing to the action scenes. Unfortunately this doesn't have as much slow tension as the first film but rather has long raging gun battle throughout  this does tend to bring it down to the level of a standard action movie but it does have some standout scenes that lift the film. The strobing fight on the subway is the most effective but the battles between police gangs and predator are also very well handled. Overall the action is great but could have benefited from more slow tension building. That said this sequel doesn't make the mistake that other creaturefeature sequels have made  this keep the Predator hidden even though we already know what it looks like. For the most part the Predator moves cloaked and we only really seek the consequences of it's actions rather than the whole beast revealed. This keeps a certain mystery and helps build a certain amount of tension.The final battle between hero and Predator is not quite as good as Schwarzenegger's confrontation with the alien but is still a good finish to the film. It's easy to believe that Arnie could use the jungle and stealth to defeat the alien  but Danny Glover Mr 3 days from retirement? taking on the Predator in what is essentially an extended fist fight? Sorry  it's fun to watch but a little hard to believe.The performances are good Glover gets to be a Riggs type rather than a Murtaghretirement case. Paxton plays the energetic side kick and continues his killeralien experience that he started in Aliens. Even Busey now almost completely bereft of his star status and wallowing in video thrillers is good here as a shadowy FBI agent. Sad to think that he got so good at this role that he got regularly typecast and is now doing things like Lethal Tender Universal Soldier 2 and many others I've tried hard to forget. The rest of the cast do well as fodder for the predator but it's really all about the action.The film contains some nice touches that develop the Predator in the same way that Aliens took a step along from Alien. The feeling that the Predator has hunted across all worlds including the aforementioned alien is cool as well as some other things that you get from the ending that I wouldn't spoil. But the attempt to give the Predator a sense of mercy is a bit forced. In the first it wouldn't kill an unarmed person i.e. it always wanted sport. Here this extends to it sparing the life of an armed police woman because she is pregnant that just seemed a little out of character to me but I understand why they did it.Overall this is a solid action movie with plenty of good scenes. When compared to the first movie it almost holds it's own but it lacks the sense of fear and being hunted that the first brought  this has tension but the first film have tension by the bucket.".

He even moves his Lethal Weapon character to this film a cantankerous cop! And that's not all Bill Paxton Arnie's costar in Terminator fills his place in this sequel. That doesn't mean that half a loaf is better than no bread.This rough sequel was made for those who after seeing the first imagined what it would be like if Predator climbed an urban bus and the balconies of the flats instead of climbing the jungle palm trees. It was a HUGE success that Arnie decided to star in Total Recall instead of starring in this bullshit of movie. The same goes to the director of the first John McTiernan who dodged a bullet directing in the same year The Hunt of the Red October.This sequel honors the saying of Second parts were never good and supposed the beginning of the end for the alien character of Predator since the poor have not taken advantage of good way in any of the sequels that have been made  They are all a garbage and when they put it so that it was faced against Alien already was the height of absurdity.In this returns Kevin Peter Hall from the first one but newcomers as Maria Conchita Alonso Running Man Robert Davi Raw Deal Licence to Kill Gary Busey Lethal Weapon complete the recurring roles.A piece of garbage. To see if they leave in peace the films of Schwarzenegger and they do not make more sequels shreds of their films nor more remakes that they are well as they are!!The movie is not that there is much good to say. Bad if and a lot although it is so insubstantial and lacking in interest that I do not know if it's worth it to waste time dissecting such a mess since it is also one of the sequels that piss me off so I'll say something to Mr. Hopkins  sure you read me.Look Stephen...Steve...we know you're mediocre you just have to see your intolerable Lost in Space 1998 to realize that you do not have much to offer us so I do not understand how you embarked on a project like this and you produced such colossal garbage. Can you promise me that you'll continue with your crappy The Reaping films and leave our favorite bugs quiet? I hope so I and many more will thank you.".

The voodoogang's whole mystique the hard music score the attention for detail  the southAmerican influenced interior design of the druglord apartment or the interior of the alien shipthere are some hidden treats for the trained eye like the alien skull and other interesting trophies and not at least the creature's design are just a few examples for the stylish quality of this much better than the original sequel. Danny Glover brings a touch of real to the tough but human lead character while Bill Paxtonbadmouthed as alwaysI just love this guy in everything he's done Ruben Blades and Conchita Alonso are the flavor of this adrenalin ride. Keep out an eye for the color composition of virtually every scene  a treat. There's no killing what can't be killed...".

First of all the original revolves around Arnold S.although I still find it to be Arnold's best movie and also like Carl Weathers and Sonny Landham who is this 80's actionman stereotype onedimensional feelnopain killing machine who nobody in their right mind can identify with and second the jungle is much too obvious a studio set.The second Predator on the other hand is set in an anarchic future in the asphaltjungle midst a drug dealerspolice violent confrontationI loved the warzonecity vision and hunted by government agentsthis being an excellent pretext to display some stylish shootingtechniques and unusual angles and also explain the creature's nature and motives who want to capture the beastGary Buseyanother brilliant performance to study it for it's killing potential. The voodoogang's whole mystique the hard music score the attention for detail  the southAmerican influenced interior design of the druglord apartment or the interior of the alien shipthere are some hidden treats for the trained eye like the alien skull and other interesting trophies and not at least the creature's design are just a few examples for the stylish quality of this much better than the original sequel. Danny Glover brings a touch of real to the tough but human lead character while Bill Paxtonbadmouthed as alwaysI just love this guy in everything he's done Ruben Blades and Conchita Alonso are the flavor of this adrenalin ride. Keep out an eye for the color composition of virtually every scene  a treat. There's no killing what can't be killed...";

The Predator movies are a fan boy's dream come true as the Predator is arguably the best alien on film. The Alien movies and The Thing nonwithstanding. It's not Citizen Kane or anything but the film has plenty of action decent performances and plenty of the Predator including the showing off of a few new gadgets of his. I always liked the fact that Predator 2 is set in an urban environment the jungle is too remote. Not enough prey you see. Although Los Angeles 1997 doesn't look like that then or nowmost parts anyway the movie does a good job of putting the Predator in what I like to call a target rich environment. Danny Glover isn't Arnold but he does a good job as the lead anyway. Arnold didn't make the first movie good the Predator did. I think a lot of you miss that. The late Kevin Peter Hall does as well as you can ask from a character with no lines or facial expressions to speak of. Bottom Line A decent followup to Predator.

	schema:headline " The same things happen only this time it sucks.";
	schema:reviewBody "Now here is a textbook case of doing everything wrong in a sequel. 1990's Predator 2 refuses or fails to preserve what made the first Predator any good makes some terrible creative decisions and falls into a toxic vat of clichs. It has story problems casting problems and originality problems. The novelty of the Predator has worn out in this film and the whole thing was a bore from start to finish. It's no wonder that this movie isn't brought up much when discussing the Predator franchise it's overwhelmingly forgettable.So this time around the locale has changed from a dense Mexican jungle to the city of Los Angeles. While this film could be admired for risking such a style change the effect is unoriginal and very outof place. It takes away from the Predator's primal mystique. Also for whatever reason the script introduces an entirely new cast of characters without a single returning actor and scarcely a mention of Arnold's original team. Again this is not a bad change in and of itself but here it only leads to a rehash of familiar plot devices. The audience already knows that the mystery killer is an alien hunter but they still have to spend over an hour watching the main characters figure it out. Where's the fun or the suspense in that?The same can be asked of the Predator itself. At this point we've seen what the Predator can do and this movie doesn't offer any new tricks. It looks the same acts the same and shamelessly rips itself off by copying the heatvision POV which is utilized randomly and pointlessly here as well as the mask removal scene. They even reuse the 'ugly motherfer' line. The movie would have been better served if the antagonist was a new variant of the Predator with some new tricks up its sleeve  la the 2010 sequel Predators.Like the first film Predator 2 has some character issues. Replacing the always enjoyable Arnold Schwarzenegger is Danny Glover who makes a horrendous protagonist. He is constantly angry overly violent and completely unlikeable and is just not believable as an action hero. The rest of the underdeveloped cast is just as bad relying either on forced exposition to describe characters or painfully obvious archetype clichs to develop them. We hear about how much of a hero Glover's character is even though this is never demonstrated and about his longtime friendship with his police partner though this is never proved in their interactions. At one point a female cop grabs a flirting Bill Paxton by the family jewels and threatens him to leave her alone. Okay we get it she's a strong and independent woman who doesn't take crap from anyone. There were many better ways to show it. Ultimately you won't remember any of these characters ten minutes after you finish the movie.Put all these factors together and you get a severe lack of entertainment. While the first film was riveting and intense this one is just an unremarkable bore. The story was lame and unwanted the Predator itself is now derivative and the characters are pathetic. The best thing about it was the musical score and of course it was ripped straight from the original. The most interesting thing this movie had to offer was the possibility of a crossover with another classic scifi monster and we all know how that eventually turned out. Don't waste your time with the lackluster Predator 2. I give it 2 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:headline " Good dialogue good action great cast  great film";
	schema:reviewBody "The title summarizes it well. Despite what the naysayers would have you believe don't take their word for it. Predator 2 is every bit as wonderful as its great predecessor. I'm very surprised that people think that P1 was better than P2. Why? Because of the dialogue where Arnie goes 'We're not assassins we're rescuers only' and people believing that BS? Please! My verdict  Both Predator films are outstanding. It's just too bad that idiot Paul Anderson was the one who was in charge of directing the pathetic attempt at a 3rd movie. But then again this isn't the place to discuss the trauma that was Alien Vs Predator. The action in P2 starts fast and furious from the very beginning. The characters are emotionally charged with Danny Glover Bill Paxton Maria Alonso all giving good performances with smaller characters such as their captain and the police chief above him still being decent characters who are played respectfully well by their actors. I suppose audiences nowadays want to see more of the stereotypical politicianidiot of a police captain and chief and maybe they couldn't handle seeing a police chief who had justifiable gripes with his officer's behavior. At least that's my theory. MINOR SPOILER Gary Busey leads the other half of the cast those being the federal agents who are out to freeze the predator and steal its technology. This is definitely Busey's best performance next to Lethal Weapon 1. His character's a hard who doesn't have the desire to talk to anyone who isn't within his tightknit agency so much so that it's obvious he's going through major pains when he finally cracks and tells Glover's character all he knows. Must've been hard for him. And oddly enough Busy and Glover make a decent team even if it was one that resembled two magnets that naturally act against each other. We find out a bit more about the predator's background. His ship was nice ditto for his array of new weapons and the ending where we see that predators had been on earth for centuries was cool. So they CAN speak English hehehe END SPOILER And the bit where Glover's character greets Morton Downey Jr's as the latter is bugging him for comments after yet another series of murders? Beautiful D My first minor gripe about this film is that there are a few too many expendables who show up simply to be chopped up by the predator. While the first movie had a small number of characters so that every death was noticed and counted the second one has literally dozens of cops federal agents drug dealers and civilians who encounter and are killed by the monster. That created some amount of desensitivity to the violence which is bad although the predator's victims are never forgotten by Glover's character as he relentlessly goes after the monster which is good. My second gripe is that the villainous drug dealers are all onedimensional as there's nothing more to them than standard runofthemill bad guys who kill with no regard for the sanctity of human life. It would've been nice if we had at least one drug dealer who had a positive side to him just like the police officers' and federal agents' negative sides that were so superbly put on film. But then again that's a problem that the first movie suffered from also  showing 'terrorists' who kill for no reason and who only exist to be exterminated by Arnie and Company's righteous soldiers.I suppose the reason for that is because the audience wants simplicity and the freedom to place people within Good and Evil labels and doesn't want complicated social explanations that can turn a good person into a bad one. If only it was easy enough for me to say that it's just a movie and it shouldn't be taken more seriously than that but it's not as this is the image of 'evil drug dealers' and 'evil terrorists' that the ignorant masses see that makes it so easy for slimeball politicians to manipulate public opinion. But that's a whole different discussion altogether. To summarize  we have locals cops on one side who want the predator's head for killing some of their own and we have federal agents on the other side who want the predator's head so they can steal his technology and lastly we have drug dealers who want everyone's head simply because those people exist. And the predator is running amok in the middle of it all. That makes this a great film. Just remember to keep in mind why Danny Glover's character is so outraged at the predator's killing of humans because human life is supposed to be precious and it's easy to forget that when so many characters in this film act otherwise. After all we have enough people in the real world who think that life is cheap. No point in seeing fictitious characters who do the same.".

Long long long underrated Predator 2 seems to be finally getting the recognition and respect it deserves. Why all of a sudden? Because when standing next to the extremely crap AvP it looks like pure gold to those miserable cynics who disregarded it when it first came out because Arnie was not in it. Fair enough a Terminator Conan or even Commando film without Arnie just wouldn't work. But the 7foot tall Rastafarian otherworldly hunter is the star of this film and this time round he gets much much more screen time. We all know what the Predator is so Stephen Hopkins shows off this ace instead of hiding it up his sleeve.The year is 1997 and the City of Angels is boiling under a 109degree heatwave. Columbian and Jamaican drug lords have turned the streets into a warzone. The police are outmanned and out gunned and incompetent. The last thing they need to deal with is the Predator.The titular hunter has returned with an increased arsenal of weapons and is keen on slicing and dicing the aforementioned druggies for fun. During a brutal gunbattle on the streets he watches Lieutenant Mike Harrigan Danny Glover a slightlycrazed renegade cop blow away half a dozen Columbian scumbags and chooses him as his ultimate prey. Naturally Harrigan and his ethnically diverse team of cops have enough problems without having to worry about their skulls ending up in the Pred's intergalactic trophy cabinet.Making matters worse is fauxDEA Agent Peter Keyes Gary Busey who pretends to be after the druggies but is really more interested in swiping the Pred's advanced technology. Yeah good luck with that! From start to finish Predator 2 is brash unsubtle inyourface walltowall action. A hectic breathtaking succession of nonstop increasingly exciting setpieces. The final 45 minutes will you wetting yourself with excitement I kid you not. While Hopkins fresh from his Nightmare on Elm Street 5 debut has remained constantly employed he's never really become a star director which is a shame since he has a slick cartoonish style and is far more talented than most other anonymous directors. Like John McTiernan did in the first he provokes a dusty sweaty and overbearingly hot atmosphere in the daytime scenes and an alien Gothic feel to night pun intended. The way he captures LA on film just makes you NEVER want to go there.Fans of Alan Silvestri's score of the first film can take comfort in the fact that all of his cool themes are back they were rudely ditched for AvP and more evolved. It's probably the most engaging score he's done. His Latin drums sinister shrieking Hermannesquire strings yawning haunting urban sound effects and occultist voodoo chants dominate every scene and give each one its own unique voice.But it ain't just that. Everything from setdesign and cinematography to sounddesign and film editing is nothing short of brilliant. If you think I'm overreacting just watch the film and see for yourself. There's nothing massproduced or conveyorbelt about Predator 2. Twentieth Century Fox chucked loads of money at it to make it the most sophisticated sequel it could be. Everyone involved seems to have made a huge effort and done their absolute best.It's sad that action films like this are not made anymore. Predator 2 is a classic the kind of movie that feels torn straight from the pages of a 1950's pulp detective novel and crossed with a Twilight Zone episode. 1010 no doubt.".

But of course everyone could've seen this coming because that's how sequels tend to be like very very pale in comparison to the original.This time we have the Predator not in the jungles of Central America but now in the streets of Los Angeles that has become overrun with a gang war between the Jamaicans and the Columbians. Putting the Predator in the big city wasn't a terrible idea because where else could you put him besides the jungle? But the thing is it worked a whole lot better when he was in the jungle because you could feel the deadly silence and the claustrophobic feel. But in a metropolis like LA you're just gonna find yourself being distracted and you can't focus enough on the Predator to be intimidated by it. And also the film spends over 20 minutes trying to hide the Predator behind its camouflage question is why? We've already seen the Predator before and we already know what it looks like so the movie is basically wasting time trying to keep us guessing.But what really killed this movie for me was Danny Glover. And Predator 2 did nothing for him except prove one fact Glover can't play the badmaverick cop. Why? Because that's just not him he's better off being the good cop who plays by the rules in the Lethal Weapon series. He somewhat acts very awkward when he tries to be the tough guy but that's just ruined by his stilted mannerisms and his good boy face. An the bottom line is he's just not very convincing. And what makes it even worse is that his character Mike Harrigan is totally shallow and not a lot is explained about him. For instance who is Mike Harrigan? What are his motives for him being a maverick? Did he used to have a family? What were his past experiences like? Movie doesn't say. In the original Predator we knew who Dutch Schaeffer was we knew he was an excombatant who got involved in too many battles and he's seen a lot of death happen. And that's when he decided to tone himself down and become a rescuer and not an assassin.And also the supporting cast is way outta the league of the one in the first movie. The special forces team members were their own individual characters and we basically wanted to see a spinoff prequel for each of those characters. But in Predator 2 all we get is Bill Paxton being bought in to do what he does best comic relief. But the jokes that tells are so outofplace and awkward and in a few small parts you can tell that Paxton is just embarrassed to be there in front of the camera and spewing out those crappy lines.Gary Busey's performance is nothing special and he basically just keeps the same expression throughout the whole way. And the idea of an NSA agent trying to capture an alien isn't even realistic.But one thing I liked about this one is that it revealed new facts about the Predator itself. It reveals that it follows a code and a law and the killings that it commits is just an act of sport. And it only kills those who are armed and it doesn't strike at a pregnant woman so it won't take away any innocent lives.But the action just doesn't interest you and the suspense is pretty much abysmal. Just watch this if you want to learn more about the alien and if you are a real diehard fan of the first movie....even though you might be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie plain sucks. I am a really big fan the original predator but this movie is junk compared to it. This movie totally undermines the whole principal of the predator. The predator is a hunter not a mass murderer. He doesn't go around killing everyone he can he picks choice kills and hunts them. Why did he kill all those people in the subway? Who knows? He didn't even take trophies of them. The scene with Keys when he tries to capture the predator is totally predictable woo i wonder whats gonna happen. Maybe his whole team will get killed by the predator. Hmm its a real toughy. Then we get the predator running into some apartment crushing some wall tiles and making some kind of healing substance. Is there something i dont know about wall tiles? or have they always had medicinal properties? Maybe its a pred thing. Then comes the ending scene which totally baffled me. Danny Glover survives a fall down a elevator shaft and ends up in a predator ship that somehow got into a underground tunnel. Well how in the hell did the predators manage to get a ship into a tunnel in the middle of a city with no one noticing? Anyways danny starts beating up a predator which has killed about 50 people through the movie with ease but some how now has trouble killing danny whose gotten his butt kicked throughout the  entire movie. Well surprisingly danny glover kills the predator when all of a sudden.. a bunch of other predators appear. They seem to have no problem with the fact that one of their buddies just died because they dont do squat to him besides giving him some old gun which makes no sense at all. What does this old gun symbolize? I have no idea. Well danny decides its time to leave so he jumps out and we have almost the exact same ending as predator only in a city setting. Everything in this movie is pretty bad. The predator couldnt hold a stick up to the one in the original he just doesnt have the same amount of skill. The jamacian drug lords are laughable stereotypes pot smoking rastafarian pimps with uzis. Danny Glover is the typical cop who cant stay out of trouble with his rag tag posse of cops who all manage to get killed. I want to know why in every sci fi movie they always have to have some scientist who wants to try and capture or make peace with some monster who has killed countless numbers of people. I have to agree with the person who was talking about danny glovers pants. They are freakin hilarious. At least 2 sizes too  big and drooping all over. Everything in this movie stinks. Dont see it. Its got every hollywood cliche all rolled into one movie. Stay far away from this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Predator was a really good film to watch. Although it wasn't particularly scary it was fun exciting and it had Sir. Arnie. So when I rented this out a couple of nights ago I was expecting something similar fun but chilling despite Glover. Instead I get a stupid boring piece of garbage! As I expected Glover is awful but everyone in the film gives terrible performances even Paxton is average after his brilliant performance in Aliens. The script is full of senseless dribble and the racist gangs are so American stereotypical drug smoking lunatics. Also I have an unusual quip about the language. I have no problem with swearing in films and sometimes it is sort of essential. In this film they just pack it in every 5 minutes a person swears!. I'm sorry but this is too much and totally ridiculous and pointless. And then we come to the worst thing about it The Predator. Arnie's guy was menacing stealthy and strong at the same time which is helped by the total beat down and laugh scenes at the end of the first film. Also it looks brilliant just as good as the alien effects. This makes him formidable and certainly not someone you'd want to meet. In this film the predator could have been beaten up by a hard teen. You need the creature to be threatening in a these films for it to work this weedy thing doesn't help things and coupled with the other terrible parts of this film it turns into a cesspool. The thing that saves this is the interesting ending where we discover some of the culture of the predators. Them rewarding glover with a trophy and the collection of skulls on the spaceship's wall is very insightful and was the only decent thing in this film. All successful sagas and by that I mean 47 films the sequel needs to be quite good. If this had been better I think we could have seen a lot more predator films but this pile of garbage destroyed a potentially great franchise.".

I checked the box and sure enough it was. So I unpaused the DVD and started again.This attempt is completely different than the first in the attempt to modernize the Predator story. The characters are less solid but more likable even though they included Bill Paxton. I don't mind Bill Paxton too much actually. You know him. He was the whinerfake spy in True Lies with Schwarzenegger. He played the whining punk leader that got his hand nearly ripped off in the first Terminator. He was the whining brother to Wyatt Erp in Tombstone. He also played the whiner Hudson in Aliens. And so now they want us to believe him as the Cowboy a renegade tough guy cop. Okay. I'll buy it. But I want a refund and a Coke okay? The Predators were done in a slick style in this attempt. I'm not going to say better but slicker. Their gadgets were better conceived as were their abilities and you really felt like you got a bit more movie for the time you spent watching it.The story was solid and the performances were better than average. The first one was slow and suspenseful a device well used in suspense type productions as Predator was. This one moved at an even pace and wasn't slow anywhere.I'm too impatient to enjoy that suspensebuilding device though. When I go see a monster movie I want action. I need the character development but the monsters better be aggressive at some point! But this one gives you both. You get to know the characters and to care about what happens to them through the exchanges in virtual nonstop action sequences. This movie starts off with action and ends with action. Niiiice production. Very nice.You also see the Alien tiein in this installment. At the end when Danny Glover is standing inside the Predator ship notice the Alien skull hanging on the back wall.It rates a 8.110 from...the Fiend .".

	schema:headline " A sequel that is far better than the first film! Rare!";
	schema:reviewBody "Rarely a sequel is better than the first movie in a series. Predator 2 is one of those rare times. In Predator 2 the acting story line and action sequences are superior to Predator 1. Predator one was good and introduced us to the Predator. However Arnold's acting was a bit bad however the purpose of the first film was not to garner Arnold Schwarzenegger an Academy Award nomination. Danny Glover is a much better actor. The movie opens up with a scene of a jungle much like the one in Predator one. Then it shows that that jungle is right outside Los Angeles a concrete jungle.  The second film also gave us a glimpse into the future. The future then was 1997. It showed how drug gangs ruled the cities and acted more like armed political factions than the traditional drug gangs. You have the police who are basically under siege and powerless against these drug gangs. Cops are out gunned and out numbered. Then we throw the Predator in the mix. I found myself cheering for the alien as he killed members of both drug gangs in pretty creative ways. Then comes Danny Glover's character LAPD Lieutenant Mike Harrigan. He's tough as nails and commands a unit of elite cops. The members of his unit are also great actors in their own right. There's Maria Conchita Olanzo Ruben Blades and a young cocky Bill Paxton. Harrigan is targeted by the alien Predator after the Predator witnesses Harrigans heroic rescue of wounded cops in the opening fire fight. As the movie moves along we find out that as the Predator is hunting the Hispanic drug gang the Jamacan drug gang and the police a secret government group is hunting the Predator. The leader of this secret government group is well acted by Gary Busey. Busey and his group want to capture the alien and learn about it's technology. This makes for more people with guns the Alien can hunt. This makes the movie more complex. But it all boils down to the Predators desire to go one on one with Mike Harrigan. Then the Predator gets what he wants however the Predator becomes the prey and Harrigan the hunter. In the end we get a glimpse or the sense of honor the Predators have after Glover kills the Predator. The Predator's buddies actually respect Harrigan and give him a trophy for his kill.    I recommend watching both Predator movies. However if you want a more believable and complex story with better acting. Predator 2 is for you.Rayvyn".

But Babe has something the sheep dogs don't have gallantry. His kindness determination and good intentions will make him a truly unique individual one that stands out from his peers proving that no matter who you are you can make a difference.I love the way the story is made. It is cut into chapters with a bit of narration giving us the warm grandfather story or old school feeling. It's a very comfortable ambiance and every animal brings its personality into making an awesome story.Now I am sure you've all seen talking animal movies before with voiceovers. Babe took it one step further with the animals' lips being in sync with their lines! Talk about realism! The sets are very friendly to the eyes and contribute into making this movie a classic.Babe is one great movie for everyone to see it's magical and enchanting!The Master T Score  out of 5 Stars".

It is a fantasy world where animals speak just like humans do.....albeit not in Australian accents which is where the film is meant to be set.The hero of this tale is a young pig named Babe who is transfered from the pig pen to the village fte to the hands of Farmer Hoggett who wins the little fellow in a prize raffleJames Cromwell. It is on the farm he meets the locals and is taken under the wing by a kind sheepdog named Fly who has been characterised as the warm and motherly type. Not so warm is Rex voiced by Hugo Weaving of Agent Smith fame her growling no nonsense other half who believes pigs do not belong with sheepdogs.Babe is portrayed as the personification of innocence and his gleeful and inquisitive nature brings him into contact with a host of farmyard animals. Not too sure why they felt he needed a furry little toupee between his ears but each to his own. As Babe gets closer to Fly and the sheepdog role he even begins to assume this role much to Rex's dismay. But Babe has an awful lot of ambition for a little animal and his heart is set on being a sheeppig.There are moments of sadness in this film such as loss and death but it is mainly sweet natured and enchanting. It is one of the few Universal rated films I enjoy watching and that is saying something for me!".

I recall sitting in the theater before the movie commenced looking at my watch and estimating the time it would end when my life could begin again after this rude 90 minute interruption.Then the film began. The moment Babe said a tearful goodbye to his mother as she was being led off to the slaughter house Pig Paradise the narrator says I was hooked. What stood out to me was not the tearful Goodbye Mom but the fact that after we see Babe's mom loaded into the truck the camera goes back to Babe siting in the corner of his industrial pen sobbing profusely. This moment maybe 90 seconds into the movie is filmed so well so perfect that instead of coming off as melodramatic it is heartrending. I know that word is used often to describe this film but I do not know how else to describe it. This is one of many heartrending moments in this beautiful film.This is by far the best childrens film I have ever seen but it really is a mistake to even call it a childrens film. It is simply a great film. A film that shows how wondrous things can happen as a result of common decency how any individual can triumph if they believe in themselves how vital is the help of family and friends in life's arduous journey.This a film not to be missed. It should have beaten Braveheart.".

It has proved to be anything but a flashinthepan. This movie will endure. It's also a beautiful film on DVD with brilliant colors and some very rich visuals. Filmed in rural Australia the scenery is magnificent and so is the house that is featured in the film. It looks like some oldfashioned gingerbread house. The animals are entertaining talking to one another like humans but not looking hokey in the process. In other words the dubbing is well done.The main character Babe the little pig is the nicest most innocent character you could ever hope to find. Listening to him talk is heartwarming most of the time and sometimes it's heartbreaking. The best comic relief is provided by the goose who wants to be a rooster. That may sound like it's geared toward little kids but it isn't. I haven't found an adult friend yet who didn't like this film.It also was good to see James Cromwell play a nice guy too. Most other times he seems to play profane and corrupt cops or government officials. Here he's just a nice old farmer who blends in perfectly with the surroundings. His wife is a bit annoying but not too bad.This is a wonderful sweethearted comedydrama with a nice ending too guaranteed to leave you with a smile or a tear or both.

This movie not only deserved the nomination but was a close close second out of the five nominees in my book Braveheart rightfully won but I would have had no trouble had Babe won.  I love this film because it has a sweet lining yet tells a deep story about resolve goodness and the struggles of life in a very large sense.  It makes you think but more importantly it makes you WANT to think about how all our lives are interconnected and what can be done by each seemingly insignificant individual to make the world a better place.

	schema:headline " A Pig's Fascinating Tale";
	schema:reviewBody "Remember the times when a parent or a grandparent would read to a child in bed so that the child can visualize the story and comfortably sink into hisher dreamworld? Well 'Babe' feels like such a story. It is a heartwarming tale about a Pig called Babe by her 'Mom' and her friends at the farm. Chris Noonan executes it in such a wonderful way. The film is broken into chapters just like in a book and the lovable talking animals appear like very real and humanistic characters. the lipsyncing is impeccable. Also I liked that the film doesn't completely refrain from reality as it does show that pigs are killed for meat or that puppies are given away or sold to others. It stays honest. The voiceacting is very well done. Christine Cavanaugh's childlike voice remarkably fits Babe. Miriam Margolyes Danny Mann Hugo Weaving and Miriam Flynn are all pleasing. James Cromwell is wonderfully restrained. The setting is a makebelief storybook farm. I found myself wondering 'Is this an English farm?' and at the same time being confused that the people were speaking with an American accent but there's really no need to pick on that because it simply doesn't matter. Just enjoy the beautiful farm and the lovely characters. 'Babe' is one of the finest family films. Kids will surely love it. Heck even I loved it when I saw it during my late teens...and I still love it as an adult.".

	schema:reviewBody "Babe is separated from his family and becomes friends with some of the animals on his new farm.  He learns that each animal has a role to play and that both he and Ferdinand the duck are fated to be lunch!  Both take new roles to escape their fate and Babe tries to become a sheepdog.  As Farmer Hoggett begins to notice the unusual way Babe can work with the sheep he begins to groom him for that role  much to the worry of his wife and the other farm animals.Written by the guy who wrote the Mad Max films  that's what kills me.  I know it's adapted but how can the Mad Max writer manage to deliver such a sweet film that is unassuming and comic and heart warming.  The plot is great as it is adapted from The Sheeppig' but Miller's script adds so many comic touches that it's funny throughout.  The characters are all well written so that we care about them and get easily drawn in.It's directed well and again feels fresh and different  whether it's the chapter set up or the use of the narrator or the way that the singing mice make the links it all works well.  Because it is gentle and unassuming I found myself involved in it so easily and the themes of finding your own path and friendship are not rammed down your throat but just sit there if you want to get them.  I've seen this several times and the silent wonderful climax to the sheepdog trials makes me choke everytime even if it is predictable.All the voices are good and the use of animals is faultless.  The use of animatronics is a little ropey at times but the sense of goodwill the film gave me extended to overlooking these minor complaints.  James Cromwell is just superb as the human face in this drama  everytime I see him now I can only hear him say that'll do pig'.  Babe is a great hero and you feel for him from the start to the end  when he gives a little satisfied sigh it's difficult not to feel warm inside.Overall this is one of the best children's films I've seen  it's light and unassuming and not a classic but it is comic gentle and ultimately heart warming  what more do you want?".

	schema:reviewBody "A simple likable feelgooder. In lesser hands 'Babe' might easily have risked excruciating death by treacle or by camp. It does have a couple weak spots those nonsequitur mouse songs for instance do nothing for me and I always wonder why they used fake American accents for the idiomatically British dialogue. But for the most part the inventive direction and sense of genuine whimsy not unlike those of 'Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain' steer it away from the most dangerous pitfalls. The blend of CGI puppetry and real animals is subtle and wonderfully believable with the 'performances' of Fly and Rex standing out in their eloquence and realism. Much has been made of course of James Cromwell's acting here and he certainly is an authentic very charming presence throughout. But Magda Szubanski's work shouldn't be overshadowed eithereven her walk is rich in comic detail. In the end there's not a whole lot to this film but the good things outweigh the bad the dark edges keep it all from getting too sappy and some of the more expressive moments truly achieve a kind of magic. 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some films are so enjoyable that it is nearly impossible not to smile through them as they teach subtle lessons and Babe is one of the best. It is the odd being that can't laugh at the antics of the animals of Farmer Hoggit's farm as Ferdinand a duck tries to usurp the role of the rooster three literate and musical mice read title cards aloud for younger audience members and best of all Babe a Hoy piglet learns the job of the brilliant herding dogs Rex and Fly to win the annual sheep herding competition. Clever animation well done animatronic creaturedoubles and a menagerie of superbly trained farm animals makes the story of the little pig who could be more than just bacon for breakfast a film for the entire family. A simple story that underscores that hard work and tolerance for those different from oneself is to be respected in the kingdom of all animals Babe certainly brings to the screen through comedy and drama lessons all ages can understand. As Babe grows bigger through the great job of fattening up by Mrs. Hoggit he makes friends with a sheep who conveys much wisdom about the rules of farm life where Rex is the dominant working dog and the sheep are considered ignorant. However Farmer Hoggit and Babe share a special relationship that confounds his wife the sheep dogs and the sheep. Hoggit trains Babe how to herd sheep and he's a mighty smart and fast learner ultimately changing the rules that dominated the pecking order of the barnyard  because that's the way it's always been with good manners and friendship.James Cromwell as Farmer Arthur Hoggit gives an understated and superb performance as the patient farmer who is willing to give a young pig a chance. This is one of the most delightful family films which is perfect for seasonal gettogethers or just because its a nice change to see a film devoid of car chases explosions and four letter words yet adult in its message as well. Every library should have its own copy of little Babe a Pig of Destiny.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Take The CITIZEN KANE of talking animal movies.For many years BABE has been on the same line as THE WIZARD OF OZ and E.T. as a classic family film. It even made a runaway success in the boxoffice charming audiences around the world in theaters back at 1995. It even made quite an impression in the Oscars being nominated even for Best Picture and 6 other Oscars winning one for Best Special Effects winning it fairandsquare from APOLLO 13. So with all the buzz that's still going on with BABE is it really that great! For most parts BABE still lives up to its title The little film that could.While it ain't quite as perfect as the films I've mentioned above BABE still deserves its place as a classic family film choice. It's painted with creative storyline interesting characters and simply delightful moments of joy fear sadness and sweet triumph. Sure it's only an Animalscantalk movie but this is the smartest one to date and still is. Before being bogged down into terribly mediocre films like RACING STRIPES talking animal movies can actually potentially achieving as this one. The characters both human and animals are given a surprising depth. In the animals of course there's Babe voiced by Christine Cavanaugh a curious and benevolent piglet with a lot of kindness in his heart yet must go through depression and sadness a the same. His life leaves little less value to humans who doesn't see him more than just another feast for the Holiday season. That is except for the compassionate farmer Arthur Hoggett James Cromwell the most valuable human character in the movie who sees his talents as a pig who actually knows how to herd sheep by talking to them respectively no less.BABE maybe a straightforward children's film but it no doubt still has power to charm any adult audience out there thanks to its adult script thankfully cowritten by George MAD MAX Miller adapted from a novel by Dick KingSmith and an especially endearing performance by the underrated James Cromwell as the farmer. The special effects too are worth mentioning as they are a convincing alternation between animatronic creations and real trained animals. But BABE will be best remembered not as a technical marvel but a clever and imaginative story. That'll do. says the farmer. Enough said.Rating  out of 5.".

But once you got over the initial shock you forgot about it and just basked in the story.Personally because I am such a prolific reader I really enjoyed the storybook format with the chapter headings. It felt like being curled up on the sofa with my faithful companions which in my case are three cats safely tucked around me in front of a crackling fire with a nice warm afghan a good mug of hot chocolate and my favorite book.No matter how many times I see this movie I always walk away with warm fuzzies knowing I've been treated to a rare delight.

The crux of the plot concerns a religious zealot that disdains alcohol women and gambling yet feels no empathy at blowing away the enemy. God and Country I guess. As the story progresses he feels betrayed by his comrades.The problem I had was that during the first half of the movie the acting seemed stiff and all but Rooney seemed to be overacting...to the point of parody.

I wonder since Rooney is uncredited as one of the directors perhaps he stepped in to pull this one out of the fire.The crap game is legendary and the final action is quite good. The ballad sung over the opening credits and at the conclusion are an added bonus.While not quite as good as Attack1956 or The Steel Helmet1951 this is still fun 50s war stuff.".

The story of American foot soldiers in Italy in 1944 concentrates on three characters who have a certain amount of psychological depth in the Oscar nominated writing. Wendell Corey stars as a cynical well off guy who's afraid to shoot but not surprisingly gets the courage in the well done climax to fire back and even destroy a German tank. Don Taylor's role is the most complex as the sergeant Preacher a hard taskmaster sexually repressed and unable to accept when he finally meets a woman that she has already been with others.But Rooney nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar has the show stealing big scene as a gambling obsessed little dynamo when he plays with dice in a tent full of other soldiers and scrambles for his scattered bills after the lights go out. In the combat scenes that finally come an hour into the picture when they go on recon patrol in a forest he gets killed trying to retrieve some of these winnings.The rock formations later in this scene are a giveaway that the movie was shot not in Italy but in Southern California. Rooney's acting throughout is hyper wound up almost as if he were on pep pills during the shooting.Director Lewis Foster based on his credits looks worthy of further study.".

His filmmaking resources were limited as is apparent in the film since he uses natural lighting nonprofessional actors and a delicate sound system but it only gives the film a stark and more authentic look making the atmosphere more terrifying and a the experience more real. Most of the 'props' and 'sets' and even many of the Nazi soldiers were real. Unlike many historical films this one does right by the historical facts even though it's a work of fiction.What is most outstanding is Rosselini's compelling storytelling. Instead of showing us a documentary account due to lack of filmequipments he gives us a moving story of resistance. I was also impressed by the subtle way he brought out the characters such as the homosexuality of the Nazis. He also extracts marvelous performances from his actors. Aldo Fabrizi and Anna Magnani stand out. The background score though used minimally adds some melodrama but not in a poor way.If one can look beyond the poor technology of the film 'Roma Citt Aperta' is one of the most powerful films of its genre. Though the film may depress and at some point horrify the viewer the ending is profound and hopeful. In the end it's a story about fear courage integrity and hope.".

It was shot almost immediately after the city was liberated from the Germans while the Germans still occupied the streets.

The resulting film however is unique and deeply moving and is a film of historic importance.Open City was the first of the great Italian Neorealist films followed by Paisan The Bicycle Thief Shoeshine I Vitteloni and Umberto D. These films were characterized by the use of nonprofessional actors natural lighting location shooting the desire to get closer to everyday reality and the struggle for dignity of the masses of people.Though I strongly recommend this film there are a few minor quibbles. The Nazi leaders are portrayed as homosexuals who are associated with a decadent life style. This is contrasted with the Resistance representing the church and the family. Though I do not grant the Nazis much in the way of humanity I think these broad strokes only obscure rather than clarify. Likewise there is an over identification of the Resistance as Communist. Though the Communist Party made up a good part of the Resistance it also included Christian Democrats and Socialists.Open City though depressing in its presentation remains hopeful. This hope for the future is symbolized at the end of the film by the children making their way back down into the streets of Rome after witnessing an execution.

	schema:reviewBody "Over time Rossellini's legacy has been overshadowed by that of his contemporaries Fellini and de Sica.  There are reasons for this.  Fellini had a unique cinematographic eye and a gift for abstract symbolism.  De Sica was able to capture the incidental and indeterminate in a way that practically elevated it to the level of the holy.  His use of nonactors was far more effective than Rossellini's as was Fellini's use of actors. Rossellini's scripts were often twodimensional his cinematography spotty and his editing odd.  So why is it that he occupies a leading position among Italian auteurs?In fact Rossellini was not a neorealist but a realist.  Compared with products of the neorealists his films are thin and wooden.  If on the other hand one views them as works of tragedy they are excellent.  From the very start of Open City it is clear that the seeds of disaster are sewn.  A pregnant mother is to be married to a member of the resistance. Members of the clergy and children are also involved in fighting the Nazis. Italians are united against a common enemy Fascism.  Yet we know that while victory is inevitable so is death.  Perhaps it is the darkness of the tight seedy interiors that tips us off.  Perhaps it is because we do not feel that sense of endlessness beyond the screen but that we are being led through these building and streets along with the characters.  Perhaps is is the German marching songs.  Whatever it is we feel the march of destiny leading us to some terrible conclusion.  Fate can never play a role in neorealist work by Bazin's definition it is constructed organically and arrives at its destination as if by chance.  Tragedy can only be the purview of the realist.Open City is not without its liabilities.  For one Arata's cinematography while startling at times is unsatisfactory at others.  The script written by Fellini and Amidei is confusing and allows for minimal character development.  N.B. The English subtitles add to this confusion excising whole chunks of crucial dialogue.  Several of the performances are undynamic such as those of Maria Michi and Carla Rovere the villains portrayed by Giovanna Gallett and Harry Feist are very much in type Aldo Fabrizi who as Don Pietro is so central to the plot is guilty of overacting.  Above all one doesn't get the sense that Rossellini's camera falls in love with its subjects the way that one might wish it did.  Yet it is in this very impassiveness this plastic script and detached camera that the key to Open City lies.  This is not a film about a painter and his son nor does it lovingly portray an old pensioner and his dog.  This film is about the horrors of war not a subject for which Rossellini expects to find an empathetic audience.  In the absence of footlights and the invisible third wall he uses the greatest tool at his disposal to create tragic theater our own lack of nobility.Open City is a portrait of human courage in the face of overwhelming odds. It confronts us with horrors which God willing we may never know.  Don't watch it expecting to fall in love with the grittiness of World War II era Italy.  Expect to be deeply moved.".

	schema:headline " Rome during the war";
	schema:reviewBody "Roma citta aperta is a film that cries for a Martin Scorsese to come to its aid in restoring it. There are sequences that are barely visible as proved by the recent showing on the Sundance channel. Roberto Rossellini deserves better. We are even surprised that his own daughter Isabella so well connected with the world of cinema has not done more to champion the restoration of this masterpiece.Most comments in IMDb dismiss the film without taking in consideration the impact it had when it made its debut. If not for anything the people that worked in the period of the post war took advantage in showing a reality to the viewers and revolutionized the Italian cinema forever. The neorealists were notorious for engaging nonactors to portray the characters they created. It's easy to be critical of those movies that came out during those years and make comparisons based on today's tastes.Roberto Rossellini was a genius who saw the movie industry destroyed during the terrible WWII days. Out of the necessity the neorealism style came into being. Directors from that period saw the opportunity to do things differently by bringing the actual filming into the streets of Italy.

One the one hand he presents us the forces of evil in this case the Germans that wanted to the oppressed masses the Italians in a story that puts them at odds and that would favor the enemy because they had the power and their country's leader was collaborating with the invading forces.There is a sublime appearance by Anna Magnani perhaps the best Italian actress of all times that is worth the price of admission. Even though she only appears for a short period her presence looms large in the film and in our heart. We watch horrified as Pina runs after the truck where Francesco is being hauled to prison for a fate that seemed clear to Pina. That sequence will remain one of Rossellini's best achievements.Rossellini also shows how demoralized the Germans were. There are also hints of homosexuality as well as lesbianism in the movie. This fact also plays in our consciousness as to how we perceive them. The betrayal of Pina's sister shows how some people collaborated with the enemy in order to get the material things they couldn't get otherwise.In addition to Anna Magnani there are great appearances by Aldo Fabrizi Marcello Pagliero Nando Bruno Giovanna Galletti and Henry Feist. The music score is by Renzo Rossellini which plays well with the story. Ubaldo Arata's cinematography stands to be enjoyed more if the film would be restored to its original glory.This was Roberto Rossellini's masterpiece.".

	onyx:emotionText "Roma citta aperta is a film that cries for a Martin Scorsese to come to its aid in restoring it. There are sequences that are barely visible as proved by the recent showing on the Sundance channel. Roberto Rossellini deserves better. We are even surprised that his own daughter Isabella so well connected with the world of cinema has not done more to champion the restoration of this masterpiece.Most comments in IMDb dismiss the film without taking in consideration the impact it had when it made its debut. If not for anything the people that worked in the period of the post war took advantage in showing a reality to the viewers and revolutionized the Italian cinema forever. The neorealists were notorious for engaging nonactors to portray the characters they created. It's easy to be critical of those movies that came out during those years and make comparisons based on today's tastes.Roberto Rossellini was a genius who saw the movie industry destroyed during the terrible WWII days. Out of the necessity the neorealism style came into being. Directors from that period saw the opportunity to do things differently by bringing the actual filming into the streets of Italy. It was a way for making movies that didn't conform to the established rules up to that point.Roma citta aperta was Rossellini's way for analyzing what went wrong in his country.

Seen within the context of its time and with reference to the circumstances under which it was made OPEN CITY is a staggering accomplishment even so by modern standards it feels visually static and slightly contrived.The great strength of the film is in the direct way Rossellini tells his story of Italian resistance fighters trying to dodge capture by the Nazis in occupied Romeand in the performances of Anna Magnani and Aldo Fabrizi as two Italians who become increasingly caught up in resistance activities. But time has not been entirely kind to the film the story seems somewhat superficial portions of it lack expected intensity and some performances seem more than a little artificial with a lesbian subplot the famous torture scenes and Maria Mitchi's performance cases in point.Ironically these drawbacks actually result from comparisons with later still more realistic films that followed its exampleand it is a great tribute to the strength of the film that it survives the revolution it started as well as it does. One does well to recall that at the time OPEN CITY was made such slick Hollywood films as MRS. MINIVER were considered the height of realism. Still because of these issues I would hesitate to recommend OPEN CITY as an introduction to Italian neorealism for one not already wellversed in it.

	schema:reviewBody "Rome Open City is a good film but it is clearly a far more historically important film than an artistically great one the predominance of hagiography and agitprop make this almost inevitable. Too many times its lead characters be they Italians or Germans good guys or bad guys fall into stereotypes and the action plunges into melodrama. Pina's senseless death is the best example as she would truly have to be stupid to do such a thing in real life with her son right there. But it does set up the rest of the film's drama and narrative pieces. And there can be some rightful criticism of the film's dishonest portrayal of the Italian Resistance which was virtually nothing in comparison to the French Resistance culpability for the Second World War and relative prosperity and lack of internal destruction versus other European nations. Nonetheless the film did sweep the Cannes Film Festival and many others worldwide and it has a number of touches that redeem its clichs such as having Don Pietro's glasses be broken so that he can only hear not see Manfredi's slow death or the literal killing of two lambs by the Nazis right before Marina betrays Manfredi which in its rendering is far more affecting than in its mere description. It should also be mentioned that in a brief scene an Italian tot's naked bottom half including genitalia is shown which both adds to the claims of realism and satisfies the dramatic arc of the moment highlighting how silly most censored scenes and moments in film are. Rome Open City does not broach greatness but it does entertain and inspire even almost two thirds of a century after its conception and sometimes that's something which has even more effect than hermetic greatness. So ciao and it's on to Paisan!".

	schema:reviewBody "It is easy to die with dignity it is much harder to live with dignity Padre PietroUsually when I encounter commenting on WWII movies I have mixed feelings. I am aware that it's hardly possible to fully evaluate their intensely diverse levels. The situation occurs even harder when commenting on such a legendary movie as ROMA CITTA APERTA. It seems that it is easier to end about it well but much harder to say about it so. Rossellini's movie is one of the true masterpieces dealing with WWII a symbol of Italian Neorealism a wonderful psychological insight into individual and social deeds. Moreover it is the film made just in the core of those events the Rome of the mid1940s. All latest movies on WWII though very well made seem pale and only acted when comparing to this one. Let me discuss the movie in more details.ROMA CITTA APERTA is a true INSIGHT into various CHARACTERS in their hard REALITIES that force them to particular deeds. They all cope with resistance from the German fascists who divided Rome into 14 zones and control it. The characters range from the simple Il Sagrestano the engaged couple Francesco and Pina young boys devoted Padre Pietro performer Marina to the most wanted man Giorgio Manfredi a true character the Communist Celeste Negavilla. They all cope with individual dramas combined with psychological tiredness Pina plans to set up a family yet fatal events of hatred do not allow for her happiness one of the boys badly seeks a father yet the army of death does not accept fathers or sons some want careers as performers yet the times force service to blind propaganda only good Christians want to live with dignity and love yet the world can only offer humiliation and hatred in return. The satanic patience of the Nazis seems to win. And here arises a question are they all forced to do things they'd never do?... That profound development of characters though may seem too harsh for Germans occurs to be especially thought provoking and psychological.ROMA CITTA APERTA is filled with GENUINELY TOUCHING MOMENTS. Except for the final scene  the symbol of the movie when the sad boys walk to the city of Rome just after the executionmartyrdom of their earthly angelic tutor Padre Pietro I'll never forget Pina's death supposedly so unnecessary as a loss of life but truly so significant as a cry for freedom and dignity. Anna Magnani does a terrific job in this scene you as a viewer seem to shout with her in despair Francesco! Another great moment is when Marcello Pina's son asks Francesco Can I call you father? This seems to symbolize that simple affection never dies and remains a genuine sign of hope in the world of madness and hatred. Besides who can forget the moment when Francesco places hope in Pina that the future would bring life anew dreams anew happiness more stable. Throughout these moments there is an intense atmosphere something that keeps you on your chair speechless.ROMA CITTA APERTA stands out as a movie with a very clever and profound SCRIPT. It thrilled me when Bergmann with satanic irony says to Padre Pietro I DO NOT care about your rules! and Padre answers calmly But the One above you and me DOES Hartmann's reflections on Nazis' deeds constitute an accurate psychology of doubt even among these monsters. His character also atones a bit for the image of the Germans. But the final words about living and dying in dignity are the quintessential of the movie and leave a timeless message. But all the word masterwork sums up in another crucial aspect.ROMA CITTA APERTA is one great harmony of flawless PERFORMANCES. Who comes to view as the superior cast is of course the unforgettable Anna Magnani. Her symbolic role of Pina representing the despair of the nation is one of the greatest masterpieces one can encounter in the history of cinema. I do not exaggerate Anna does something above flawless acting she IS Pina! Aldo Fabrizi gives a profound performance as Il Padre stressing right Christian attitude filled with love justice openness. Harry Feist does a terrific job as wretched Nazi officer Bergmann and Maria Michi as Marina of the Piburtina Street. This film deserves to bear a name masterpiece thanks to performances alone.ROMA CITTA APERTA is undeniably one of the most precious pearls of human thought in cinema. It lifts up the mind and soul beside all its content of war death and cruelty it still fills our minds with hope of the better world. Yet eternal walk of humanity towards the gates of peace has not finished yet. However as long as there are viewers who acquire the spirit of this movie such walk does not occur in vain.Oh Rome the Eternal City the Beloved City the Historic Treasure of Humanity Open Your Gates to Peace Open the Gates of All Human Hearts!".

	schema:reviewBody "Open CityThe NeoRealistic film Open City relives the tragic suffering of Italy and the people's resistance to Nazi occupation during World War II.  The story depicts how a liberation group tries to conceal its leader Giorgio Manfredi.  The role each plays in the resistance reveals an intimate portrayal of their lives.  Whether for religion love rebellion greed or nationalism these rebels attempt to make sense of war and cope with their problems. The omniscient point of view provides an understanding of each character's motivation to survive their dreadful situation. The director Rossellini made Open City an attempt to restore the nationalism from the chaos left by the war.  In order to restore the nationalism for his audience Rossellini reconciled the characters' differences through their common motivation for better lives.Brecht said in referring to NeoRealism it doesn't show real things its shows how things really are.  I feel that despite the low budget and quality of stock Rossellini made an excellent film full of real life images. The strength of the screenplay through its poignant representation of the wartime struggle made Open City an outstanding film.  Rossellini properly explained the human condition in a way that Italians and all viewers could empathize.  However I am not convinced the film's message came across correctly as a nationalistic film.  In the documentary NeoRealism a gentleman thought it depicted Italians poorly.  This contradicts the entire message of the film.ContentThe screenplay by Sergio Amidei and Federico Fellini powerfully captures the importance of the characters' personalities set in this wartime struggle for survival. The motivation of Pina and Francesco is love.  They enjoy a love for their country their son and their lives.  Especially poignant was the scene in which they sat in the stairwell and remembered the good times and hoped for better.  Pina's sister Marina is motivated by greed.  She has had many lovers and even sold her friends for her materialistic needs. She finally sees the effect of her horrible deeds but then it is too late when Manfredi is dead.  Giorgio Manfredi is motivated by his nationalism for Italy and loyalty to the liberation movement.  His patriotism and loyalty to friends are idealized in the imprisonment and a torture scene where he refuses to talk and is at peace with his fate as a martyr.  Don Pietro Pellegrini is motivated by faith.  Don Pietro believes that God's Will has brought the war.  He believes prayer and forgiveness are the answers to suffering.  Nevertheless he is also a practical man.  As a forger he shows he can contribute more than prayer to the struggle.  His compromise as a religious figure suggests that there are no black and white lines separating roles and ideals of the independence movement.Marcello Pina's son is motivated by rebellion and group behavior. Marcello although young and immature is an excellent representation of the citizens who organized and rebelled against the Nazis.  The point is made that even at his age he could play a role in the war.  Marcello therefore symbolizes the significance of the most insignificant person and the struggle of all Rome.  Also as a youthful figure he also symbolizes the future of Rome and Italy.  In the final scene he and his friend console each other as they march back to the city.  This suggests that Italians must comfort each other and rebuild after the war.FormThe film's low budget is evident through its various technical flaws.  The film stock was a poor quality and originated from different reels.  In splitting the stock there lacks a consistent flow to the film.  There are points in the film where sound is completely eliminated and others where camera angles are suddenly adjusted as if they were editing over a previous scene editorEraldo Da Roma.  A lack of continuity is seen in the scene where a car is filmed approaching a building.  When the car stops the film seems make a quick edit and then switches to a new camera angle as people leave the car.  Another flaw is the poor quality of lighting in the film. In an effort to put certain emphasis on a person or object light floods some areas.  This makes it impossible to view it without difficulty. Additionally too much light is given when a medium shot is given to characters as they sit giving a monologue.  Ingrid the Nazi's girlfriend often receives too much light when she speaks.  Perhaps it is her pale skin or the cinematographer's desire to emphasize the face resulting in overexposure cinematographerUbaldo Arata. This distracts from the movement and speech of the actress. Finally the colors of the apartment walls are too bright.  As characters move throughout the hallways and stairways the bright light background reduces their depth and texture.".

	schema:headline " It would mean an Italian is worth as much as a German";
	schema:reviewBody "On its initial release Roberto Rossellini's 'Rome Open City 1945' was hailed for its harrowing documentary realism sharing the 1946 Palme d'Or and even today it is regarded as the type specimen of Italian neorealism a movement that produced such treasures as 'The Bicycle Thief 1948' and 'Umberto D. 1952.' The film's photographic style which is coarse and unstylised could certainly be considered classically neorealistic as could Rossellini's unavoidable preoccupation with Italy's fascist history and wartime devastation. One might suggest that the film's unexceptional filmmaking technique was imposed upon Rossellini rather than being an entirely deliberate artistic decision the Germans had only just withdrawn from Rome and its citizens were still reeling from years of Nazi occupation and Allied bombing. Just as Carol Reed filmed 'The Third Man 1949' amid the crumbling ruins of wartorn Vienna Rossellini uses the backdrop of a fallen city to emphasise the disintegration of a formerly unified nation now surviving only in fragmented patches of human spirit that must now be forged back together again.Rossellini's film is most often praised for its realism and for its primary focus on the ordinary citizens of Rome. However during the film's first half I didn't find this approach entirely successful. Rather than centering the film intimately on one or two characters as Vittorio De Sicae did in his two wellknown neorealist films 'Open City' instead jumps from one to another manufacturing a sense of unity among the oppressed citizens of Rome but also diluting the viewer's ability to identify with any one character. In this sense the film is similar to Pontecorvo's 'The Battle of Algiers 1966' or even Eisenstein's 'Battleship Potemkin 1925' in that individual characters hold lesser prominence than the ideals for which they are fighting. Suggesting that the art of neorealism took several years to perfect Rossellini also occasionally veers towards melodrama. Scenes involving the arrogant Major Bergmann Harry Feist establish a simplistic us versus them mentality offering Germany as the outright villain in a manner similar to that of any early 1940s American propaganda film.I must admit that I found myself lessthancaptivated during the film's opening half perhaps because Rossellini wouldn't focus exclusively on any one character. The most interesting moments were those tinged with drama  a German soldier unexpectedly removes a gun from his pocket a terrorist bomb shakes the city buildings. But if I had any doubts about the director's technique then the harrowing realism of Anna Magnani's death photographed as though through the lens of a bystanding newsreel camera without any dramatic fanfare or unnecessary cinematic punctuation convinced me of its merits. Notably Rossellini deviates towards drama in his film's second half but I considered this an improvement my complete sympathy now directed towards a specific character the dignified Roman priest Don Pietro Aldo Fabrizi. The German treatment of captured rebels is unflinching in its hostility including a prolonged torture session with a blowtorch and a sombre firing squad execution as city children watch on with downcast eyes. Interestingly Rossellini doesn't end the film with an Italian victory as might be expected. The misery lingers any victory could only be hollow.".

	schema:reviewBody "The beginning for me felt quite slow and uneventful as is characteristic of Italian neorealism. Italian neorealism likes to establish the normality of everyday activities which expresses the lives of locals and being a pretty fastpaced person I did not like this much. Also the dialogue delivery was a little awkward at first but perhaps this could be a cultural difference in speech and conversation.The acting was quite good. Magnani plays her part well and her chemistry with Annichiarico is prominent though not the same can be said between her and Francesco. She gives a moving performance in her last scene as well with her desperation and emotions traversing the screen. Fabrizi as well gets into the shoes of his character well and plays the part of the priest convincingly. Francesco and Pagliero as part of the resistance to the Nazi occupiers don't really seem to be doing anything but talk. Understandably they have to be cautious but I don't believe I actually saw them 'resisting' anything except via words. Well there was an exchange with other rebels but it just seemed like they were pretty inactive. Additionally some characters are well developed while others are ambiguous or stereotypical. Pina seems to be the protagonist and her character is pretty well established but she doesn't carry the narrative not in the second half anyway. Don Pietro is another well established character who has no surprises. Francesco and Manfredi are depicted as the heroes but not in the conventional sense as they don't do heroic stunts and the other female characters in the film are shallow and presented as stereotypes. The story doesn't flow in one continuous movement and more or less feels like it plods along. There is a clear linear narrative but it was just a little slow in the first half. Plus there are a few discrepancies and ambiguity to what happens to some characters. I'm not sure if I missed some scenes admittedly I fell asleep for a few minutes but Francesco's character just disappears. Apart from that there are some very saddening scenes which make this film quite depressing. Read more movie reviews at championangels.wordpress.com".

The huge film industry that had once been known all over Europe was quite literally in ruins.Hence when Roberto Rossellini took up his camera in 1945 to start shooting 'Open City' he was forced to make due with quite a few limitations using scavenged film stock whatever kind he could get his hands on shooting outside and on location and employing a much more dynamic though much less controlled form of cinematography than Italian cinema had previously seen. The result was an unpolished rough gem of a film that in addition to its many contributions to the evolution of cinema left the prewar Italian superspectacle in the dust.In terms of story 'Open City' is pure melodrama and a pretty darn affecting one at that. Thematically it's socialist a reaction against the fascism personified by Mussolini that had just been defeated in Italy. But it is in its style that the film truly stands out.With 'Open City' Rossellini succeeded in taking adverse conditions and using them to craft a solid emotional tale of the Italian resistance. In the process he solidified the aesthetic of an entire film movement Italian Neorealism.The film is recommended to anyone who enjoys a good story is interesting as an artifact of its historical period and is absolutely indispensable to anyone with at least a passing interest in the history of cinema.".

But it is in its style that the film truly stands out.With 'Open City' Rossellini succeeded in taking adverse conditions and using them to craft a solid emotional tale of the Italian resistance. In the process he solidified the aesthetic of an entire film movement Italian Neorealism.The film is recommended to anyone who enjoys a good story is interesting as an artifact of its historical period and is absolutely indispensable to anyone with at least a passing interest in the history of cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "Roma Citt Aperta is between the most important movies in the history of Italian cinema. It is not only one of the initiators and masterpieces of Italian neorealism but also a beautiful story of courage rebellion against blind evil and faith. I can't really relate to the faith part as my ideas are much different from those spread by Don Pietro but the let's say secular part moved me much more than I thought it would especially the iconic race where Pina tries to get her husband back from the Nazis. She is so frantic and desperate in pursuing the impossible goal of running away from all that darkness a small tear piled up in my eyes. Even the Nazis are not depicted in such a blackorwhite manner seeing a couple of them actually realizing as their colleagues threaten beat and murder that they belong to no higher race after all. The only flaw is at the end where actual facts are changed so that it appears that the Nazi general pulled the trigger on the priest while it was not so the Italian government imposed to the production to present it this way to prevent possible agitations. So I'd say that Sergio Amidei's script is a truly heartbreaking thoughtprovoking piece that deserves its fame in Italy and elsewhere. Rossellini is a great director he technically invented alongside maybe Luchino Visconti Italian neorealism with this film but knowing that he actually directed movies for the fascist regime beforehand doesn't let me love his hand behind the camera when he shoots a story against the Axis. Acting. Anna Magnani and Aldo Fabrizi easily steal the show actually they take it by right as their characters existed in real life more or less as in any work of fiction and their duty was to make their memory last forever they did beautifully.".

	schema:headline " Rossellini's reclamation project of Italians under Nazi occupation is a classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Shot between January and June 1945 Roberto Rossellini's Rome Open City chronicles the effect of Nazi occupation on the people of Rome a year earlier. Unlike other films of the time many scenes were shot on location in a documentary style. The lack of funds and good film stock forced Rossellinni to cut corners so the quality of some of the scenes do not appear to have been lit properlynonetheless the sometimes grainy images add to the overall verisimilitude of the narrative.After Italy faithfully followed the fascist dictator Mussolini for twenty years and he was finally deposed two years earlier Rossellini's main intent was to rehabilitate the Italian people in the eyes of the world. No matter how noxious Mussolini was his machinations could never equal the sheer terror machine which was Nazi Germany and the Italians under the yoke of Nazi oppression became victims soon after Hitler's troops marched into Rome and began terrorizing the populace.Rossellini's main protagonist is Giorgio Manfedi Marcello Pagliero an engineer and Communist resistance leader who we later learn did 12 years hard time as an antiFascist agitator. After escaping the Nazis by fleeing from a rooming house and climbing over rooftops Giorgio makes his way to the apartment of fellow Resistance fighter Francesco. Not home yet he ends up speaking with his nextdoor neighbor Pina Francesco's pregnant fiance played by the iconic Anna Magnani whose performance as Pina made her a star.We're next introduced to Don Pietro a Catholic priest sympathetic to the Resistance who is scheduled to officiate at Pina and Francesco's wedding the next day. In Rossellini's world view Don Pietro and Giorgio are not incompatible despite past conflicts between Communists and a rightleaning Catholic church. The Nazi terror bonds them together and indeed Don Pietro is more than willing to help Giorgio by taking money and information to Resistance leaders outside the city. As a priest he is permitted to roam about during the curfew.The collaborators are represented by two women Pina's sister Laura and Marina Giorgio former girlfriend who both work at the same cabaret and receive financial support by prostituting themselves to German officers. The fact that Giorgio never suspects that Marina is a collaborator is perhaps one of the most glaring weaknesses of the script.Rossellini did a wonderful job casting a dance hall entertainer Harry Fiest to play the SS commander in the City Major Bergmann. Some have complained that Bergmann appears effeminate and it's been argued that homosexuality was often linked to the perverse evil of the Nazis in films of the time. In reality Hitler and many of his minions may have actually been homosexuals see the book The Hidden Hitler by Lothar Machtan but the association of Nazism and homosexuality should not cause those in our own time to conclude there is an underlying pathology to being gay in fact the Nazis of course persecuted homosexuals but of those Nazis who were homosexual it's been posited that they didn't see themselves as gaytheir wrath was reserved for homosexuals of a more liberal or leftwing persuasion.Bergmann is aided by another collaborator the Italian Fascist police chief and with his help a raid is ordered at Francesco's apartment. Giorgio escapes but Francesco is rounded up and in a shocking brilliant scene Pina is gunned down as she runs toward Francesco who is being taken away in a truck full of prisoners. Francesco fortunately escapes after resistance fighters ambush the truck and free its captives.Not all the Germans are seen as evilan Austrian defector comes to Don Pietro seeking help but he's eventually arrested by the Gestapo along with Giorgio and Don Pietro after Marina betrays them for drugs and a fur coat Bergmann's assistant is Ingrid an apparent lesbian who is involved with Marina and convinces her to give up Giorgio. Francesco manages to avoid arrest when he tarries for a minute longer saying goodbye to Pina's young son Marcello.Rossellini creates an odd set where Bergmann's headquarters is in a room sandwiched in between a torture chamber and bar for the officers. Bergmann is more than a onedimensional characterhe's nuanced enough to recognize that if he fails to gets his prisoners to talk they'll be considered on the same level of his fellow Nazis who he presumes will never break under torturethus negating the theory of the master race. Another great touch is when Captain Hartmann Bergmann's underling blurts out that all the Nazis know is killing killing killing while he's intoxicatedbut the next day while sober ends up executing Don Pietro with glee!Giorgio is the first to undergo torture and Rossellini makes it even more horrifying when Bergmann opens the door to the torture chamber and allows the audience glimpses of what's going on. He brings Don Pietro in since he can't see clearly after breaking his glasses earlier on and gazes at a Christlike Giorgio then realizing his fellow resistance leader is dead. In a brilliant scene the often selfsacrificing priest suddenly loses his cool and curses out Bergmann and his group including Marina who faints at the sight of her deceased former boyfriend. Don Pietro is of course only human and we come to realize that sometimes religion is a mask for repressed rage. The denouement involves the execution of Don Pietro up on a hillsidewitnessed by boys from his parish. Notably the Italian soldiers intentionally fire and miss at the doomed priest tied up to a chairand the aforementioned Captain Hartmann delivers the coup de grace.The brilliance of Rossellini's vision lies in his lack of sentimentthe tragedy of lives lost at the hands of monsters is never softpedaled. Rome Open City is a classic due to its powerful script and indelible images.".

This approach does not seem to be working as the boys as a collective are an unruly bunch. In turn the teachers don't teach but are always watching out for the next subversive act from the boys. January 15 1949 marks the arrival to the school of the new supervisor M. Clment Mathieu a middleaged man who is grasping at finding his place in life after a series of failed endeavors. Although he does find the boys an unruly lot Mathieu does not believe in the action  reaction policy and as such butts heads with Rachin while secretly undermining the policy.

Mathieu Clement is such a man. His kindness toward the children is returned to him by the students as they respond to the way he teaches music to motivate and interest them. M.

We also hear a song by Rameau La Nuit which is sung with such sweetness that it disarms us and get us into the right mood for enjoying The Choir even more.The film owes a great deal to Gerard Jugnot who plays the kind teacher who sees possibilities among all these kids. His take on Mathiew Clement is the right one because the children see in him someone that is the opposite of the other teachers and the mean principal. As the director of the school Francois Berleand does a good job in portraying this egotistical man who can't see what his own cruelty is doing to the young people in his charge.The children are as sweet as one expects them to be. Especially Jean Baptiste Maunier who plays the young Pierre Morhange. Also an angelic Maxence Perrin enchants the viewer as the young orphan Pepinot.

	schema:headline " Caged birds sing";
	schema:reviewBody "There's an air of romance surrounding wayward boys particularly in the French tradition where they tend to be poetic as well as mischievous. In The Chorus Christophe Barratier draws on this tradition and adds some lovely vocal sounds. The Chorus is about an internat or reform school where a new principal who writes music tames his young charges some naughty some just abandoned by teaching them to sing in a boys' chorus. The school director Rachin sounds like Nurse Ratched Franois Berland of Jacquot's The School of Flesh is a prissy sadist who preaches a philosophy of instant punishment for all real or imagined wrongdoing actionreaction but when the new principal Clment Mathieu Grard Jugnot shows up with a soft approach to his classes and his supervisory duties he finds allies among the faculty and staff.The Chorus advances the frequently screened theory that delinquent kids are better charmed than chastened that if you can find a positive activity they excel in the misbehavior will die out.Barratier has had good success with his young actors. The most important boy is the tte d'ange head of an angel tall fairhaired Morhange JeanBaptiste Maunier who's often in trouble and refuses to join the choir till Mathieu catches him singing by himself and discovers his star soloist. Morhange's voice possesses not only a rich natural musicality but the haunting purity only boy sopranos have. Morhange has the most attractive mother and Mathieu's success in encouraging the boy's singing makes the pudgy bald man fantasize romance with her  thus incidentally clearing himself of the suspicion of pedophilia that tends to haunt any allboys school setting. Mathieu's romantic dream is futile and he humbly fades away at the story's end like some Gallic pied piper of boy sopranodom.The Chorus takes place in postwar France and its topic and look establish immediate links with a bevy of seminal French films. Wayward French boys turn up in boarding schools that are places of both repression and refuge as you can see in Jean Vigo's school revolution in Zero for Conduct 1933. The beloved textbook of the French badboy tradition is AlainFournier's Le Grand Meaulnes The Wanderer which was notably filmed by JeanPierre Albicocco in 1967. The tradition becomes more autobiographical in Truffaut's 1959 400 Blows which introduced the director's alter ego JeanPierre Laud and in Malle's moving and longcontemplated memoir of a boarding school in wartime Au Revoir les Enfants 1987. Jean Cocteau mythologized a badboy idol who haunted him all his life in the Darglos of Les Enfants Terribles 1950 made into yet another classic film by JeanPierre Melville. This whole idea has remaining traces in the feral youth Gaspard Ulliel plays in Andr Tchin's recent Strayed. The Chorus it is true is a relatively conventional entry except for adding music it rides upon rather than transcends the tradition. But it's a warm story with much charm and little pretension.Barratier himself is a talented musician who like Mathieu has drifted into other things. A trained classical guitarist he won several international competitions after studying at the prestigious cole Normale de Musique in Paris and played professionally for several years. But in 1991 he joined Galate films to train under his uncle the renowned actor producer and writer Jacques Perrin  who bookends The Chorus as a Morhange who has grown up into a famous classical conductor. For the next decade Barratier was an associate producer and collaborated with Perrin on Children of Lumire Microcosmos Himalaya and Winged Migration. Now he has turned his hand to fiction and directed his own film with success. There is a risk of preciosity and sweetness mostly avoided by the dryness of both Mathieu and Rachin as characters as well as the surviving wickedness of the boys especially an arch badboy Mondain Grgory Gatignol. The point of view is Mathieu's and the mature Morhange's so the film doesn't go as deep into the boys' psyches as it goes into their voice boxes.The director is well connected. He's the son of film actress Eva Simonet and besides his uncle his grandparents were also theater people. The Chorus was top box office in France after its release in March 2004. The French critical reception was pretty mixed and the film's been reviled by some in the United States as in one writer's words unbelievably inane saccharine and derivative all smooth nutrientfree clichs. Even thumbsup king Roger Ebert didn't like it this feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film he wrote. Where's the quirkiness the nuance the deeper levels? But it's really a cleanly made simple humanistic and satisfying little film with far less pandering than its critics claim and whether we like it or not it's the French Best Foreign Oscar entry and the little chorus is likely to perform  Vois sur ton chemin on Awards night if their voices haven't changed. The relatively minimal miseenscne and the period setting link it more with its classic film antecedents than with the overproduced Very Long Engagement Jeunet's film's Oscar nominations are for dcor and photography. Derivative and conventionally themed? Yes. Barratier has acknowledged The Chorus's inspiration in an earlier film La Cage aux Rossignols The Nightingales' Cage 1945 which has the same premise  and anyone can name a long list of movies about teachers who charm their wayward flock. None of them feels  or sounds  quite like this movie though. And the boys do their own singing the tte d'ange really has the voix d'ange. American reviewers missing the nuances plug Les Choristes into Mr. Holland's Opus or Dead Poets Society and find it stereotypically schmaltzy. The gentler French critics don't see those crude comparisons and are able to call it un beau film and find in it a satisfying example of cinma populaire. We can too if we open up to it.".

	schema:headline " A Choral Music Teacher's review with SPOILERS  be forewarned!";
	schema:reviewBody "As a certified choral music teacher I want to add my .02 regarding this film.I personally very much enjoyed it. It illustrated extremely well the positive effects of music in students' lives discipline problems minimizing selfconfidence rising and just making a child happy to find an activity they enjoy pursuing. Watching Mathieu conduct the first set of choral warmups as well as teaching Morhange proper posture made me smile as these are familiar teaching tools to choral directors.What made this different from a film like Mr. Holland's Opus is that the movie didn't end with a large concert attended by an audience of supportivecrying parentsstudents in honor of Mr. Mathieu. In The Chorus Mr. Mathieu was fired from his job and went on to teach music privately for the remainder of his life. The cheesy typical American style which would have the film end with a swelling orchestral score as the aforementioned concert audience stand to cheercry with joy would certainly evoke an immediate emotional response. However this is an example of Hollywood being Hollywood. It's impossible to NOT get emotional when Mr. Holland hears his orchestral composition performed for the first time at a retirement concert in his honor. Hell I got verklempt seeing that. But sadly it simply doesn't happen that way. The Chorus illustrates this well with it's unpretentious take on the life of a struggling musician trying to make it as a teacher. The following is what happens to a large majority of vocal music professionals with big aspirations  they end up teaching fullparttime in a collegeuniversity setting a school system or give private lessons in a very humble manner occasionally finding a chance to compose a small work for a local event andor sing in a local operachoirmusicaletc. without any fanfare. Those who DO go on to perform professionally almost ALWAYS say Well I wouldn't be able to do this without working as a teacherprofessor. That's where all professional singers start. These people teach for years often touching the lives of students in countless numbers of ways then retire to live a simple quiet life. Heshe will get a 'Thank You' from a few students and maybe some parents but beyond that not much else. For most as they look back on their careers they are generally happy to have had opportunities to teach young people the magic of music as well as feel that magic themselves as the occasional performercomposer.Music teachers can also identify with some situations in this film. Who could forget when Mondain was hauled away and Mathieu leans out the window and says ...but he was my only baritone. As much as Mathieu despised this illbehaved hellion he was in fact his only baritone for the choir leaving Mathieu somewhat disappointed when he left.Also the attitude regarding music in the eyes of some school administrators i.e. Mr. Rachin in the case of the film should not be foreign to many music educators. The music program is deemed completely unimportant and unnecessary UNTIL it is noticed as a success and a delight  only then does the administrator praise and announce his 100 support for the music program  and of course claim the program as his brainchild.I wish I could show this in a classroom. There are however a few crude scenes which make this impossible.The only reason why I gave this a 9 out of 10 is that the 'action' began to slow a bit towards the last 13 of the film. I found myself losing focus as the month of May rolled around in the film.To comment on what another member said regarding the music skills coming about too fast. Do remember that this film takes place over several months with progress not seen until the Spring. This is not atypical and not unusual at all. With an inspiring determined teacher and daily rehearsals with implementationsconsistent enforcing of 'good singing habits' all of which the boys had in the film true quality can be seen over a span of a few months. The progress of the boys singing skills in the film was therefore NOT so unrealistic.In my opinion every music educator should see this film  especially if one is in the choral music field. It is inspirational without being pretentious and well shmaltzy. It's a much more truetolife portrayal of the ups and downs of a music teacher with hopes of something bigger. Those not in the music field who are perhaps used to overthetop portrayals such as Mr. Holland's Opus may not find themselves giving the film a standing ovation.".

Who could forget when Mondain was hauled away and Mathieu leans out the window and says ...but he was my only baritone. As much as Mathieu despised this illbehaved hellion he was in fact his only baritone for the choir leaving Mathieu somewhat disappointed when he left.Also the attitude regarding music in the eyes of some school administrators i.e. Mr. Rachin in the case of the film should not be foreign to many music educators. The music program is deemed completely unimportant and unnecessary UNTIL it is noticed as a success and a delight  only then does the administrator praise and announce his 100 support for the music program  and of course claim the program as his brainchild.I wish I could show this in a classroom. There are however a few crude scenes which make this impossible.The only reason why I gave this a 9 out of 10 is that the 'action' began to slow a bit towards the last 13 of the film. I found myself losing focus as the month of May rolled around in the film.To comment on what another member said regarding the music skills coming about too fast. Do remember that this film takes place over several months with progress not seen until the Spring. This is not atypical and not unusual at all. With an inspiring determined teacher and daily rehearsals with implementationsconsistent enforcing of 'good singing habits' all of which the boys had in the film true quality can be seen over a span of a few months. The progress of the boys singing skills in the film was therefore NOT so unrealistic.In my opinion every music educator should see this film  especially if one is in the choral music field. It is inspirational without being pretentious and well shmaltzy. It's a much more truetolife portrayal of the ups and downs of a music teacher with hopes of something bigger. Those not in the music field who are perhaps used to overthetop portrayals such as Mr. Holland's Opus may not find themselves giving the film a standing ovation.";

	schema:headline " Gerard Jugnot is extraordinary as a failed musician who arrives at a boarding school and transforms the rebel children";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a marvelous ode to classic music  to childhood plenty of innocence  friendship  cooperation  curiosity and comradeship . Being inspired by the film La Cage Aux Rossignols 1945. It revolves around the widely successful orchestra conductor Pierre Morhange Jacques Perrin  who reminisces about his childhood inspirations when he and his former classmate Ppinot Didier Flamand read the diary of their old music teacher Clment Mathieu Grard Jugnot  thanks to this boxoffice film he earned the title of the highestpaid French player in 2004 overtaking Jean Reno  Jean Dujardin  Vincent Perez and Grard Depardieu. Set in 1948 in the postwar season at rural Fond De L'Etang Internat  there arrives a watcher as well as professor of music  Clement Mathieu  as he becomes the supervisor at a boarding school for the rehabilitation for minors . What he discovers disconcerts him  as the current situation is repressive with a stiffupperlip Principal Francois Berland who ruthlessly punishes some rebel kiddies . This troubled ragbag of lopsided children is unwittingly awaiting an empathetic patron who believes in transformation through the conductor's baton rather than the cane executed by the headmaster . As Clement becomes into an enlightened Samaritan pedagogue with hopes for their hearts . While  a young Morhange is the badly behaved son of single mother Violette Marie Bunel and Clement brightens up the school and assembles a choir  leading to the discovery of Morhange's musical and physical talents and a transformation in the children . Through the power of song  Clement tries to turn the students . And Clement's ditzy fancy for one boy's mother stretches the plot .French cinema has a great ability in dealing with films about childhood  with interesting and thoughtprovoking messages that are a clear example of an allegory of notorious values  such as friendship  honor  philanthropy  collaboration and mistreating denounce . This is an splendid ode to childhood  a nostalgic trip to the past in which we become children along half and hour  where everything was discovered  in which the songs and chorus were serious things . Sincere in its sentimentality  it is cutely optimist that believes in the redemption as metaphor of the golden heart .

	onyx:emotionText "This is a marvelous ode to classic music  to childhood plenty of innocence  friendship  cooperation  curiosity and comradeship . Being inspired by the film La Cage Aux Rossignols 1945. It revolves around the widely successful orchestra conductor Pierre Morhange Jacques Perrin  who reminisces about his childhood inspirations when he and his former classmate Ppinot Didier Flamand read the diary of their old music teacher Clment Mathieu Grard Jugnot  thanks to this boxoffice film he earned the title of the highestpaid French player in 2004 overtaking Jean Reno  Jean Dujardin  Vincent Perez and Grard Depardieu. Set in 1948 in the postwar season at rural Fond De L'Etang Internat  there arrives a watcher as well as professor of music  Clement Mathieu  as he becomes the supervisor at a boarding school for the rehabilitation for minors . What he discovers disconcerts him  as the current situation is repressive with a stiffupperlip Principal Francois Berland who ruthlessly punishes some rebel kiddies . This troubled ragbag of lopsided children is unwittingly awaiting an empathetic patron who believes in transformation through the conductor's baton rather than the cane executed by the headmaster . As Clement becomes into an enlightened Samaritan pedagogue with hopes for their hearts . While  a young Morhange is the badly behaved son of single mother Violette Marie Bunel and Clement brightens up the school and assembles a choir  leading to the discovery of Morhange's musical and physical talents and a transformation in the children . Through the power of song  Clement tries to turn the students . And Clement's ditzy fancy for one boy's mother stretches the plot .French cinema has a great ability in dealing with films about childhood  with interesting and thoughtprovoking messages that are a clear example of an allegory of notorious values  such as friendship  honor  philanthropy  collaboration and mistreating denounce . This is an splendid ode to childhood  a nostalgic trip to the past in which we become children along half and hour  where everything was discovered  in which the songs and chorus were serious things . Sincere in its sentimentality  it is cutely optimist that believes in the redemption as metaphor of the golden heart . It's a kid's movie but its strength lies in its universal character  not a story just for kids  it's for everyone . This entertaining film displays a colorful as well as evocative cinematography as well as a wonderful musical score .

History shows that this ordinary individual has a talent for spotting genius in others and by the conclusion of the film we are exuberant at the rounding off of each theme and character. I defy anyone not to have a tear running down their cheek at some stage of this film. It tugs at the heart strings and is uplifting at the same time. In particular the two final scenes warrant special attention and acclaim. The view of tiny little hands all saying their own farewell is one of the most moving scenes I have seen in any movie. Les Choristes truly deserves wide acclaim and the sacrifice made by Gerard Jugnot in helping finance the film is a credit to his belief in this script and a reward for delivering such a wonderful family film.This film restores a balance to humanity and highlights the dignity of ordinary human beings and the hope we all have for happiness and to leave our mark on the world.".

This film about a recentlyhired school supervisor Clment Mathieu at a French reform school for boys in 1949 is one more entry in the exceptional teacher genre. For many of us the appeal of these films is that we have had such a teacher in our lives.The school named Fond de l'Etang literally bottom of the pond houses an impressive collection of rowdy boys some orphaned or otherwise scarred by the war. The headmaster is a harsh disciplinarian whereas Clmeant is more gentle and reasoned in his approach. About all you need to know about the story is that in this particular case the inspiring teacher accomplishes his noteworthy achievements by way of forming a choir. Not all is sweetness as there is one rather incorrigible boy Mondain Grgory Gatignol who establishes a truly scary presence introduced into the mix. It is interesting to compare this movie with Blackboard Jungle where Glenn Ford faces a somewhat similar situation. The gritty realism of Blackboard Jungle is in stark contrast to what we see in Les Choristes leaving one to puzzle about how a Hollywood film from 1955 has more depth than a French film from 2004.Jacques Perrin adds some nice touches in his brief appearances  he does a particularly fine job as an orchestra conductor in an early scene. After Clment whips the choir into shape they perform some stunningly beautiful pieces. Maybe they are unbelievably good but that does not detract from being able to enjoy their performances. I replayed the last ten minutes of the movie several times just to listen to the chorus.This is a sentimental and predictable film but nicely done.".

As their story is recounted we first meet Clement Mathieu Gerard Jugnot a short balding failed musician who in middle age has no other prospects than to take a job as supervisor in the prisonlike school run by a sadistic martinet Rachin Francois Berleand who treats his faculty as viciously as the students.The ensuing plot conceit is a familiar one the steadfast Mathieu gradually wins over the insolent anarchical kids through music and kindness as he introduces a choir program to brighten the otherwise dull steady diet of the three R's and the punishments meted out by Rachin.This little gem has been a surprise hit wildly popular both in France and internationally. The choral numbers are sublime performed by an established French boys' choir whose soprano soloist JeanBaptiste Maunier sings flawlessly and acts the role of young Pierre Morhange a central figure among the youths here.The film is a remake of a 1945 movie La Cage aux rossignols  A Cage of Nightingales. First time writerdirector Christophe Barratier was himself a musician beginning musical studies at age 7 he also sang in a boys' choir and later studied at the Paris Conservatory. He is the nephew of Jacques Perrin the wellknown actor and film producer Microcosmos Himalaya Winged Migration who here plays the adult Pierre Morhange now an internationally known conductor one of the two men who meet at the start of this film to reflect on their experiences long ago.The story is not far fetched. I have personally known of situations in which participation in choral music turned around the lives of troubled teenagers. Amid so many films reflecting indifference destitution and violence in our world this one comes to us like a wondrous breath of fresh air. In French. My rating 8.510 A Seen on 041605.

	schema:reviewBody "'Officer 444' is rather a bad serial. It contains several of the cliffhanger genre's worst clichs without enough 'camp' value to redeem them and with far fewer thrills and stunts than one expects in a serial.The villain as is often the case in these affairs is an evil genius who hides his identity behind a melodramatic nickname this time round it's the Frog. To justify his amphibious monicker the Frog contorts his body into Lon Chaney postures. This is a stupid idea made stupider by the fact that the Frog's contortions don't seem to slow him down and don't seem to make him conspicuous. We see him lurching down an alley face averted from the camera moving tortuously ... yet he has no difficulty crossing the entire city undetected in jig time.While other villains would be happy to rob a bank the Frog will settle for nothing less than global conquest. He has developed a secret formula that will enable him to do this although precisely how the formula works is never explained the formula is clearly just a McGuffin. The Frog's secret hideout is fronted by the surgery of Dr Blakely another evil genius who performs surgical experiments on victims whom he then dumps through a trap door into a dungeon. At the press of a button the doctor's office magically transforms into a coveralls factory. The Frog has several hundred miscellaneous hunchbacks and henchgoons on his staff some of whom have cute names like Snookey and Dago Frank.The Frog's other henchman I mean henchwoman is a gal named the Vulture not an evil genius but more the Mata Hari type. She doesn't actually look like a vulture but she vamps quite a bit. Actress Ruth Royce gives much the best performance in the film in this role. This is one of those serials in which it's obvious that one of the ostensible good guys in the cast is really the head baddie in disguise.The hero of this serial is Officer 444 a cop whose powers of detection would make Craig Kennedy and Sherlock Holmes weep with envy. Officer 444 has prodigious strength and agility brilliant ratiocination and he's a master of disguise. And he's probably nice to his mother.This movie appears to have been filmed by John Ford's older brother Francis without a script. Several sequences make no sense whatever. At one point Officer 444 follows the Frog through the streets to the entrance of his hideout. Cut to a new setup as the Frog enters his hideout ... only to discover Officer 444 sitting there waiting for him wearing a disguise we've never seen before. Somehow our man 444 has got into the hideout AHEAD of the boss villain eluding all the hundreds of assistant villains on the criminal payroll and managing a costume change along the way!We also get a scene in which the Vulture villainess and several dozen henchmen throw Officer 444 onto a railway track where he lies unconscious while a choochoo trundles towards him at a painfully slow pace. Just in time along comes heroine Neva Gerber with several dozen gendarmes. The two women duke it out and the cops fight the robbers ... but nobody bothers to help 444 who lies on the track while that train keeps acomin'. Pancakes anyone?The most interesting thing about 'Officer 444' is an appearance by August Vollmer a reallife criminologist based in Berkeley California who singlehandedly revolutionised American crime detection and penology. Vollmer shows up at one point to congratulate 444 and speak a few lengthy intertitles on behalf of law enforcement. In real life Vollmer ended tragically. I'll rate this mess 2 points out of 10. If you want to see a thrilling serial skip 'Officer 444' and get a video of 'Daredevils of the Red Circle'.".

Pat O'Connor and his adapter Andrew Davies give us a portrait about the friendship of three young girls in the story as they go from childhood to womanhood in the Ireland of some time ago.We meet the three friends as the film opens. There are Benny Eve and Nan who are inseparable. They grow up and their relationship continues right through adulthood. The three friends go to university and we see them attending Professor Flynn's class which seems to be the girls' favorite teacher.Nan the prettiest of the three has no prospects of marrying into money. She decides to go after Simon Westwood a wrong choice that turns out even worse when she discovers he couldn't care less for her. He just wants to marry money and she doesn't have it. Eva the orphan girl brought up by nuns has no prospects either but she has a cottage in the country that Nan finds convenient for exploring her sexuality with Simon.The best adjusted of the three friends is plain Benny who seems destined to marry her father's clerk the reptilian Sean. She has her eyes set on Jack Foley the hunky jock. Jack in turn likes her but things intervene between them.Minnie Driver is a marvelous presence in the film. She makes the plain Benny come alive. Saffron Burrows is perfect as the vain and beautiful Nan. Geraldine O'Rawe plays Eve. Chris O'Donnell is Jack Foley who makes a good impression. Alan Cumming Colin Firth and Ciaran Hinds are perfect in their supporting roles.Circle of Friends while not breaking any ground is still a good movie to watch because Pat O'Connor's direction and the ensemble acting cast.".

	schema:headline " Touching but flawed Irish college soap opera";
	schema:reviewBody "This rating reflects my ambivalent feelings about the movie...I seem to recall the novel which I read some years ago as having a little more depth than the sexual experiences or lack thereof of its three heroines. The film comes off as a bit of a soap opera 1950's Irish style. Although I'm not Catholic myself my main problem with the movie and Maeve Binchy's novels to some extent is the constant irritating depiction of the Catholic church as an oppressive institution that exists more or less for the primary purpose of sexually repressing its adherents. Also the producers should have done some very basic research into Catholic traditions. As another reviewer also noted it is extremely obvious and not only to Catholics that the opening religious ceremony in the film is not the three girls' Confirmation at all but their First Communion. The movie thus lost credibility to me from the outset.The movie tells the story of three Irish friends who are embarking upon their college days...Benny a rather biggish supposedly self conscious girl Eve a quiet orphan raised by nuns and Nan a lovely would be sophisticate who sets her cap for the young Protestant country squire Simon. For business purposes Benny's father is encouraging his shop employee Sean to court his daughter. However Benny has fallen in love with a handsome college classmate and rugby star named Jack. Meanwhile Nan and Simon are conducting a clandestine affair in Eve's cottage. After Nan discovers that she is pregnant Simon indicates that he has no intention of marrying a girl of her social  financial status and suggests an abortion. To get out of her pickle Nan then proceeds to seduce Jack and attempt to pass her baby off as his child. Read the above... doesn't it all sound like a soap? Who's sleeping with who? Anyway carrying on...Minnie Driver gives a marvelous sympathetic portrayal of Benny a young girl insecure over her appearance caught up in her first love and awakening desires pursued by an unwelcome suitor trapped with familial obligations following her father's sudden death and ultimately betrayed by her boyfriend and one of her best friends. She's beautiful at the dance when she first reveals her vulnerability to Jack. I agree with those who claim that Benny is not sufficiently large for the role not 'big as a rhinoceros' at all...attractive figure just pudgy face...but that's a minor detail. Chris O'Donnell is perfect as her dashing young love convincing in his devastated reaction to the news of Nan's pregnancy and choosing to unhappily but nobly do the right thing marry the girl. He's much more sympathetic in the movie where he has only a one night moment of madness with Nan than in the novel where it's more of an affair. Eve seems well cast but Sean's pilfering lecherous peeping tom character is definitely overdone almost a caricature as others have also noted. Nan's character is well captured here as the viewer this one at least has sympathy for her genuine sense of giving herself to Sean when she loses her virginity her betrayal by him when he hears of her pregnancy and even to some extent her dastardly deed to both Jack and Benny for her own selfish interests. One point well brought out is that while Nan believes herself to have contempt for Catholicism when it comes to abortion we see that she has internalized at least some of the teachings of her faith.Of course the Irish music is fantastic and the country scenery beautiful the green hills streams and meandering roads. I was less impressed that the professor's lecture topics just happened to involve the sexual practices of savages. I certainly don't recall that from the novel though it's been awhile. What is the likelihood that this would have been the class subject matter for a coed freshman class in Ireland back in the 1950's?The film has a different ending than the novel which will disappoint some readers. Normally this would infuriate me but I found surprisingly that I didn't mind. In the book Benny forgives Jack and remains friends with him but having gained confidence and a sense of independence moves on with her life. Here of course we see a less complex storybook type ending with the couple getting together. Pity she has sex with him at the end...of course with a parting dig at the Catholic Church 'Bless me Father for I have sinned'. At least it's apparently at Benny's own instigation not in response to pressure from Jack. The movie is really mainly sex...either wanting it talking about it or having it. Not much else to the story.So...yes a mixed review. Not the best morals and a certain mocking of Catholic teachings or Christian teachings in general but kind of a touching story of first love a sympathetic heroine and that lovely Irish scenery.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I've never read the novel by Maeve Binchy so I'm not going to make a comparison between the book and the movie.The plot Set in the 50s. Three young Irish girls with distinguish personalities get their share of lessons about friendship love family betrayal and college life.The charactersMinnie Driver is very convincing as Benny the straightforward sensitive caring and humorous virgin with plum curves a radiant smile and expressive eyes. She is an only child and lives with her modest family taking the bus on a daily basis to go to college in Dublin.Chris O'Donnell is Jack Foley a wealthy medical student and rugby star. He is attractive and a tad naive. He and Benny fall in love their attempts to get close to each other both in the physical and the emotional sense are clumsy because they lack experience but sincere and touching.Geraldine O'Rawe is Eve Benny's lifetime friend an orphan who was raised by the nuns but who has enough guts to ask for and obtain a scholarship and stand up for Benny against Nan when need be. The pretty Saffron Burrows plays Nan Benny and Eve's childhood friend who left the village early to live with her family in Dublin. She is very aware of her attractive looks and attempts to use her wannabe sophistication to trap a wealthy man into marriage when she becomes pregnant with his baby predictable. But the man rejects her again predictable and so she betrays Benny by seducing Jack and claiming afterwards that she is carrying his child.Alan Cumming is excellent as Sean Walsh Benny's father's employee who constantly attempts to seduce the young girl to no avail. You will probably hate him in this role he truly is despicable manipulative sexually obsessed voyeur irritating etc. His hairstyle a fringe on the right please and suspenders make him look ridiculous. In one word Walsh is a real pain but Cumming gives an excellent performance here. His sleezy mimics cannot go unnoticed.The Irish landscape with its hilltops pittorresque rivers woods small roads and adorable cottages is one of the fine aspects of the movie.There isn't much to analyse here the story line is simple and the dialog pretty straightforward. The overall atmosphere of the film is friendly warm and 'cozy'. There is definitely an emotional bond between Benny and the viewers unless you're too much of a cynic to sympathize with a sensitive selfconscious modest girl set on a realistic journey of womanhood.".

Only to find out it was Alan Cummings! blush. I did like the love story but the whole pregnancy angle seemed a bit too forced and the whole mystery being solved at the end in one full swoop was a bit much. Still it was nice to see O'Donnell acting before he sold himself out and started doing dreadful movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I very recently read Circle of friends and found it endearing smart and very true to life. I felt that the movie was a very unsuccessful attempt at smashing the story line to a very tipical flick that was not at all believable. I might have enjoyed the movie more had I not read the book but I was very distracted at the seemingly nonexisting morals that were so much a part of the book. One particular annoyance is the portrayal of Nan she was an unlikeable character in the book but there was a means behind the madness. The movie had you beleiving she was just a whore but there was a whole sidestory for her motivation to seduce Simon Westward which wasn't even hinted at in the movie. While I did like the performances of Benny and Eve I thought Chris O'donnel as Jack was all wrong he lacked the upbeat sincerely easygoing qualities that made Jack Jack. I would not reccomend this movie to fans of the book that truly understood that is was more than just about some flimsy romance between Benny and Jack. I also want to note that the ending was supremely outside the scope of what is was meant to be. Someone else mentioned that is was a more happy ending than in the book but I disagree wholeheartedly. In the book you see Benny overcome her sadness and depression from that first love that would inevitably break her heart. The ending in the movie was cliche and typical of hollywood. In my opinion a very flimsy chickflick with not enough to hold it together.".

It looked like a coming of age tale the 1950's Irish setting seemed appealing the characters seemed interesting. The main character is a large unattractive girl Bennie from a small town and the story centers around her and her two friends Eve and Nan. Eve was a simple girl with a moralistic bent raised in a convent while Nan grew up a sophisticated big city girl in Dublin. The story really gets going while the three are at university. For a while it seemed like a sweet coming of age tale of some sort but I should have been suspicious when all the excerpts of college lectures dealt with the sexual practices of savages and with all the talk about sex between the girls and between Bennie and her new boyfriend a jock on campus and a premed major.The movie goes along pretty innocently for quite a while. The girls were in school and it looked like the girls were striving to expand their horizons improve their situation. They go to a dance and are caught up with boyfriends. Then a lot of the action is compressed in the last half hour of the movie turning the whole thing into a big sappy soap opera. Nan services some guy get rejected by the buffoon when they discover she's pregnant then seduces Bennie's boyfriend in an attempt to trick HIM into marrying her. Eve finds out approaches Nan with a bread knife causing Nan to fall get cut and lose the baby. The boyfriend then returns to Bennie and she takes him back and the movie ends as these two are finally about to go all the way. As it ends you don't feel uplifted Bennie hasn't learned anything or grown she remains a big unattractive girl now with a boyfriend that knows he graze in greener pastures once in a while and she'll take him back.".

He just has a way of making you swoon. And I loved the accent. My favorite scene in this movie is Jack in a tuxedo. Talk about hot! Chris O'Donnell has always been goodlooking but wearing that tuxedo  speaking with an Irish accent made me swoon.Driver gives a starisborn performance as Benny the 'ordinary' girl who dreams of more than Knockglen. You feel her pain as she deals her whole life with not being the beauty Nan is  cheer when Jack tells her he loves her.I discovered what a talent Alan Cumming is. His portrayal of Sean Walsh gave me the creeps yet I kept hoping for more screen time. Geraldine O'Rawe is another breakthrough performance as Eve. She is a loyal friend to Benny  a joy to watch on screen. Her beauty  grace are unmatched in this film.A very sweet movie  a good addition to anyone's collection. If you are Irish rent  enjoy this gem. If you are not rent anyways. It just proves that sometimes the person you want may not be out of reach. Sometimes dreams do come true.".

I liked O'Donald's character better in the movie than in the book. In the book he acted like a jerk to Benny when she was too busy taking care of her widowed mother. In the movie though he did feel a little lonely and got a little impatienthe up until he cheated on her was a little more understanding. In the book I thought they implied that Benny got together with her but I think she left it up to the author to decide. Other users says they did not get back together. In the movie they definitely did get back together. I liked the part where Benny hit the bag over that creep's head and the money spilled out! Nan and Eve were great for their part. Although I do not consider O'Donald gorgeous he is talented. I read some users comments. I also noticed the flaw they made when they said they were making their confirmation as other users stated which was really the communion. However that was not important to me. A lot of users were critical about the movie being so centered around sex. I agree with them that it did get too much after a while but those are real problems that teens and young adults faced then and now. But back then they did not have sex education. just guilt from the catholic churchPerhaps if people talked to them about the real consequences of having sex rather that preaching about it being a mortal sinthey would not have so much of a desire to have it. I think if this were a real story Benny would have made a big mistake by having sexobviously unprotected and it would be a shame for a talented smart writer like Benny to ruin her chance of having a career however the movie ended there. I do not think it was made to teach you that you should have premarital sex though realistically it happened even then though it was just not talked of It was made to entertain. It was a romantic love story not a life lesson. A lot of people were disappointed by the fact that Benny gave Jack and second chance but at least in the movie he was not a jerk like he was in the book as I said. Somebody said that the parents looked old for parents back then but it was not unusual for women to take years to get pregnet or to have many miscarriages sadly. Back then they did not have the prenatal care that they have now or ways of getting pregnet. The fact that she had only one child was also unusual for that time which also implies that the mother probably took a long time to conceive. So I thought using older parents was appropriate and backed up justly. Overall a great movie!".

All I know is what I see in the movies.  But I do something of what culture was 40 or 50 years ago. Life has changed.  The way we approach relationships has changed.  Perhaps it is this utter charm of the glossedover conventions of days gone by that attracts me.  Perhaps it is the Irish culture.But then again it was just the wonderful direction and acting all the time. Minnie Driver and Chris O'Donnell suprise us with these tender performances.  Both of these actors have done large massmarket productions. But it is these tender performances that really shine far above the flashy movies they've done before and since.Call me a romantic.  Go ahead.  Do that.  I'll just smile right back and say yes.Fine movie.".

You want it to proceed go on continue to know these people what they do what they think.Circle of Friends is such a movie.  For me.I know very little of what Ireland really is.  All I know is what I see in the movies.  But I do something of what culture was 40 or 50 years ago. Life has changed.  The way we approach relationships has changed.  Perhaps it is this utter charm of the glossedover conventions of days gone by that attracts me.  Perhaps it is the Irish culture.But then again it was just the wonderful direction and acting all the time. Minnie Driver and Chris O'Donnell suprise us with these tender performances.  Both of these actors have done large massmarket productions. But it is these tender performances that really shine far above the flashy movies they've done before and since.Call me a romantic.  Go ahead.  Do that.  I'll just smile right back and say yes.Fine movie.";

When Jack has coitus with the glamorous friend played by Saffron Burroughs and gets her pregnant he is told he decides to tell Bene whom he has by then some real affection for. As he is getting off the bus or trolley to meet her tell her and break her heart I turned the movie off and threw it out. A film really has to offend me for me to score fewer than 7 stars. No real plot and an apparent delight in hurting those vulnerable means a cinematic failure to me even with Minnie Driver's memorable character and performance. The fact that Circle of Friends was based on a novel is no excuse. Another one should have been used. A fresh and compelling screenplay could have been developed loosely using the characters of Bene and Jack. Certainly this movie was talent wasted.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw a midnight screening of this movie in Chicago last night and had to fight very hard to stay awake. The idea of a remarkably vulgar stop motion musical about Charles Manson isn't such a bad one in and of itself and there's about a ten minute stretch after the opening sequence that's really quite funny. However once the novelty of seeing explicit puppet sex wears off it's not shocking it's not offensive it's not subversive and and it's not funny  it's just boring and there's a good hour left to go. Once you've established that the real agenda is to shock and offend by any means necessary it's hard to find anything really offensive. One or two of the songs is kinda catchy in that here's a show tune written by the drama teacher from the local high school Guffmanesquire sort of way but most are instantly forgettable. About the only thing to break the monotony of puppets trying their hardest to be shocking and offensive is when they take breaks to let Charlie do some ranting  and then it's even more boring. The movie even jokes about how dull Manson's rants would get but makes you sit through them anyway. The live action sequences from the 31st century at the beginning and end seem pointless  could the guy in them even read in the first place? Would he sit through all of Helter Skelter if he could? I'm not sure which kind of people are going to get a thrill out of this  some might see Manson's scenes and feel really rebellious like they're questioning authority and seeing something they don't WANT me to see. Who's the they exactly that would find this so threatening? While there's a segment of the population that will always be ready to object to people seeing violent andor naked puppets you can disturb those people just as much by watching CNN  and that would be a much better way to spend your time than watching puppets try to offend you.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant Pop Culture Satire";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm one of the lucky few who has seen this film. Although it may frighten the meek this film is full of pop culture and social satire that borders on genius. From the opening musical homage to Paul Schrader's Patty Hearst to all the familiar faces of those BassRankin claymation holiday specials that made you feel drug induced as a child. But the most memorable thing is the portrayal of The Brady Bunch from Hell..The Manson Family. The voice talents of many well known musicians give there all to bring this Macabre musical to life. John Roecker has done his research well and slips in many symbolic messages in the film that will make people take a second look at the world around them while flashy and fun..evil can just be around the corner. This film is destined to be looked at for a long time just like John Water's Pink Flamingo has. This is a film that has a lot to say...once you're over the shock of nearly havin a heart attack watching it..you're gonna wanna talk about it !".

Don't be surprised when you see this DVD on the discount racks at Hot Topic. Once you see the cast list it is apparent that this film was tailor made for the mallpunks who clamor to buy clothing with preinserted safety pins that don't open. But indeed the vocal performances are the only reason to sit through this annoying little movie. The cast list is impressiveimpressive enough to lure in the curious before they demand their money back.The program notes for the Chicago Underground Film Festival inform the audience that every line in the film is calculated to offend. It actually should have read miscalculated to offend. Every joke misses the mark and most end up being really lame. I almost felt embarrassed for everyone involved. It's really hard to be offended by something that's obviously trying WAY too hard to offend. I get the feeling that Roecker was the kid in your classroom who uncontrollably blurted out random bits of unfunny snickering to himself while everyone else wish he'd just shut up.There's no doubt that people will be lining up to see this. I'd also wager that most who do will walk away disappointed. Does this film push boundaries? Yes. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't suck.".

I have a basic sense of what Mr. Roecker was striving for and it's a shame that the richness of the ideas didn't have a chance to be properly realized here. The concept that history isn't always what happened but how people perceive what happened is an important and mindblowing concept to lot's of folks  however I doubt many will walk away from Live Freaky with much more than a headache and a strong sense of wasting 75 minutes. The outrageous shockiness of seeing puppets do things that puppets normally don't do on screen wears off after the scene in which Charlie is introduced the songs sound like they were written during the car ride to the recording session and the voice acting is atrocious. I can't totally blame the actors though. The script could have used some serious editing.Very disappointing considering the caliber of the folks involved with this project.".

Almost all the jokes seem to be variations of the same jokes told repeatedly one after the other.

The chorus of the song is repeated more times than I could stand personally.It's not too offensive. At least to me it wasn't. Cartoons on adult swim are probably more offensive than this movie is. Many gay jokes that are told might be offensive if you are gay. Other than that if you're wanting to see this film you've probably heard all the jokes already.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a horrible film. Thank goodness it was short or I would feel longlasting regret over spending significant time on it. It's about Charles Manson and his family and how they come to murder the pregnant actress and her friends.The only reason that I laughed during it is actually a bad reason to laugh at a film so it doesn't really deserve points. There were plenty of times when the director tried to get me to laugh but every time I sat silently. I only laughed because it's a poorly done stop motion. Some of the scenes were absolutely ridiculous! I can't believe they even put them in the final project. They are so funny because they are so awful! Haha. I laughed at the movie not its jokes because honestly the jokes were twisted. There are a few different types of twisted humor there's twisted humor that's funny and there's twisted humor that goes too far and is just disturbing. This movie has the latter. It has so much of it that I was getting tired by the end of the film. It was never funny and as the movie kept going it became less disturbing so it was just there taking up time. I was bored and frankly annoyed that these characters were still on my screen. It is a short movie but it felt long because it's just so damn not funny. It tries too hard and it fails.I am going to give the movie a 10 because it actually had one good thing about it. When the scenes weren't absurdly sloppy they were actually visually fascinating. The director used good colors unique angles and really kinda just trips the viewer out. During a couple of the scenes I couldn't look away because the director's techniques were so interesting. I appreciate his work for those scenes but the rest of the movie is so bad that I almost forgot his good points.It's dialogue is original yes but it's not funny. It tries too hard and just ends up disgusting and pathetic. If I had any affiliation to this film I would change my name and pretend like I had no idea what it was. It's really that awful. It's a portrait of the horror of the human mind that's for sure. It has one good point that is overshadowed by its many failures. I would never buy this movie. I would never even watch it again.

	schema:headline " The Claymation Episode of Conan O'Brien Had Better Animation than This Piece of Crap";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I begin my review I would just like to point out that I am quite the purveyor of underground campy and tastless entertainment. Even though I just turned 30 I still have an adolescent sense of humor I loved Team America and I watch South Park religiously. Based on the clips from the website I didn't have very high expectations of Live Freaky Die Freaky but was hoping at least for something along the lines of Meet The Feebles some trashy obscene fun in a medium typically reserved for children's entertainment.My main problem with this movie is just how low budget and amateur it is. This movie should be a lesson to not attempt stop motion animation unless you actually have the money and talent to back it up. As mentioned in the title of this review the animation is about as bad as the Late Night with Conan O'Brien special that was done in claymation form. They put no effort whatsoever into sculpting the characters' bodies. It basically looked like a second grader rolled clay really fast in his hands to form arms and legs. Perhaps I would have found the pornographic scenes to be more shocking and offensive if they hired real artists to do the job. Instead it was just kinda silly and immature like the naked lady bodies I'd make out of clay when I was 7. I think in any given scene there is never more than one thing moving on the screen this includes eyes blinking and mouths moving. And in some scenes NOTHING is moving. You're just looking at still pieces of clay.I'll admit I did laugh a couple of times but for the most part the scenes were way too drawn out. It was kind of like a high school play where everyone involved is more concerned about getting through their lines vs. actually making the scenes work. After the 50th time Sharon Tate's gay friend makes a cck joke it gets really tiresome.Other random complaints The music is not very good at all. I like musicals but only when they put real time and effort into making good songs. This movie was not filmed it was made with a videocamera. The theater just screened it on a projection TV. This always kinda bugs me when I pay 10 to see a movie. What's the deal with this being in black and white? The trailers on the website were in color. Kind of misleading. Why did they decided to start and end the movie in the future the future is basically a man in a robe wandering the desert for a couple of minutes. It seemed like another pointless plot element.I think anyone who has written a good review about Live Freaky Die Freaky is either an employee of Hellcat Records who otherwise produce some fine bands or in someway connected to the production of this film. Either that or they are too young to have seen enough bizarre cinema that is actually good. This is the type of movie that at the most will be watched by stoners in the background of their college dorms....for about 5 minutes before they say This sucks let's watch Dead Alive. Meet the Feebles was very low budget and very trashy and I wouldn't say it's a great movie but at least you can see a certain level of talent in Peter Jackson's directing.Instead of watching Live Freaky Die Freaky I recommend finding the bootleg video of Davey and Goliath episodes in which someone redubbed the audio to have more vulgar content. That is probably 10 times funnier and has better animation.".

Meet the Feebles was very low budget and very trashy and I wouldn't say it's a great movie but at least you can see a certain level of talent in Peter Jackson's directing.Instead of watching Live Freaky Die Freaky I recommend finding the bootleg video of Davey and Goliath episodes in which someone redubbed the audio to have more vulgar content. That is probably 10 times funnier and has better animation.";

I would like them to make Live Freaky Die Freaky II and go in depth with the future. The Soundtrack is good though.

That would be a great reality check  something to show you how awful a home invasionmurder really is  and it would make the schlock all the schlockier once you get cut back to it. You know?

	schema:reviewBody "There's a lot to be said about Live Freaky! Die Freaky!. First off it's hands down one of the most bizarre films I've ever viewed in my life combining stopmotion scifi music dark humor and the Manson murders all into one strange little film. The concept itself is undeniably creative and original and unlike anything I've seen before. Unfortunately the opportunity to do anything even halfway passable with this film is completely wasted in a mess of trying too hard to push the envelope just for shockvalue and forgetting to add any substance to the absurdity. The cast consist of almost entirely of musicians including the members of Green Day Rancid Blink182 and more. Billie Joe Armstrong who voices the Charles Manson type character actually does an alright job but the rest of the cast comes off completely flat and just dull in their voice acting. The acting is the least of this films problems though. As previously mentioned the entire films seems to be trying to only accomplish offending and shocking the viewer by whatever means necessary. If this film was to be submitted by the MPAA it would no doubt receive an NC17 . This is is not a film for the faint of heart as it contains incredibly explicit puppet sex scenes including full frontal nudity graphic animated violence drug use and near constant profanity. This may all sound shocking but after the first puppet sex scene which is roughly around 10 minutes into the film it immediately grows tiresome and repetitive and results in a surprisingly boring film despite the chaos that is presented. The film is ultimately a darkcomedymusical with social commentary on the media and how the Manson murders were handled by them but it fails in all of these areas thanks to the abysmal writing. It's hard to believe that the script was written by anyone but a 13 yearold boy with the most embarrassingly juvenile sense of humor who just discovered the most vulgar words in the English dictionary. There are a few chuckles to be found here particularly some sight gags in relation to the medias handling of the Manson murders but the majority of the humor relies on tiresome jokes which involve the constant use of expletives and the most lowbrow sexual jokes imaginable. These jokes are made even worse that they are dragged out for close to 5 minutes on several occasions. I was hoping that the music would be the saving grace here considering the talent involved but the songs are almost as awful. The lyrics are complete garbage and the songs are anything but catchy. The film seems to be making an obvious attempt to satirize and make a statement about the way the media portrays celebrities but it's doesn't appear to be saying anything beyond Oh the media glamorizes celebrities and Manson wasn't given a fair trial. The portraying of celebrities is nothing to be shocked by and Manson is a wacko that deserves to be locked up. There's not doubt there is an audience for this out there who will enjoy it simply for it's shockvalue and absurdity but most will probably see for what it truly is. A wasted opportunity for something that could have been unique and original.".

Maybe but not the people at Hellcat Pictures the movie studio that released the first class junk that is Live Freaky! Die Freaky!.A film that is mostly stopmotion animated and features voice talent from some notable modern punk rock icons Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day Tim Armstrong of Rancid packs a lot of promise. Unfortunately the filmmakers do every conceivable thing wrong in this movie's delivery and execution.The end result is a shoddy film that is highly vulgar but meanspirited and consequently unfunny. Additionally the film's pacing is mindnumbingly slow when it tries desperately to be funny the animation is terrible and the material that is supposed to pass as acceptable in the realm of storytelling is so appallingly bad.In one of the worst framing devices ever put on film we're taken to the year 3069 I'm guessing the filmmakers put 69 at the end of that year as a joke they were sure would get a laugh when Earth is depleted of its natural resources and therefore deserted. A lone man wandering in the desert spontaneously comes across a copy of the book Healter Skelter sic. Desperate for a messiah in this postapocalyptic world he begins reading it.Every fan of true crime stories probably knows that Helter Skelter was a groundbreaking true crime novel after it was a Beatles song written by prosecuting attorney Vincent Bugliosi. The book strongly condemns the Manson family and their crimes and understandably so considering Bugliosi was responsible for putting Manson and his savage minions behind bars.However as you find throughout this movie the desert wanderer either misinterprets the book or the parts where the Manson family's crimes are condemned are torn out of this ragged aged copy. Another possibility is that a Manson devotee wrote this copy of the book which would explain why Helter is misspelled Healter as you see on the cover. No explanation is ever given.Regardless the Manson family story as read by this nomad is shown through stopmotion animation which should be the film's saving grace. Instead the animation is so bad that if you look closely hands can be seen moving the figures in some shots. A sixyearold playing with his action figures can produce better animation than this movie.Even worse rather than the remainder of the movie parodying the Manson family murders it actually seems to condone and fully support their actions. Interrogating cops have the heads of pigs and Sharon Tate and her doomed friends are depicted as shallow wasteful and stupid celebutantes.To even suggest that Manson's victims had it coming is so disrespectful that it doesn't merit words. Sadly that is precisely what this film intends us to believe.Even worse a later courtroom scene has a character that is supposed to be Bugliosi revealing to a reporter how he will write a book about the trial while donating no proceeds to the victims' families. For writer and director John Roecker to have the audacity to suggest Bugliosi's bestselling novel was made solely for profit makes me wonder just how much of the profits from this movie were intended to be donated to any good cause let alone victims of savage murders.Everything about this movie doesn't work. You can tell when the movie is trying to be funny and it's painful to just listen to every attempt at humor. Every joke in this movie is poorly timed and is often mean and shallow.There are also repellent scenes where the stopmotion figures have sex and they're not funny either. The notorious puppet sex scenes in Team America World Police 2004 were funny because they were so over the top and outrageous similar to the Michael Baylike action movies the filmmakers were parodying. In Live Freaky! Die Freaky! the sex scenes are about as clever as a real porn film with money shots and all.I don't think I have ever hated a movie as much as I hate Live Freaky! Die Freaky!. The potential in its promise and its failing on all cylinders just adds to the disappointment. The filmmakers may be skilled at making great punk rock music but when it comes to making movies they are true rebels without a clue.".

The book strongly condemns the Manson family and their crimes and understandably so considering Bugliosi was responsible for putting Manson and his savage minions behind bars.However as you find throughout this movie the desert wanderer either misinterprets the book or the parts where the Manson family's crimes are condemned are torn out of this ragged aged copy. Another possibility is that a Manson devotee wrote this copy of the book which would explain why Helter is misspelled Healter as you see on the cover. No explanation is ever given.Regardless the Manson family story as read by this nomad is shown through stopmotion animation which should be the film's saving grace. Instead the animation is so bad that if you look closely hands can be seen moving the figures in some shots. A sixyearold playing with his action figures can produce better animation than this movie.Even worse rather than the remainder of the movie parodying the Manson family murders it actually seems to condone and fully support their actions. Interrogating cops have the heads of pigs and Sharon Tate and her doomed friends are depicted as shallow wasteful and stupid celebutantes.To even suggest that Manson's victims had it coming is so disrespectful that it doesn't merit words. Sadly that is precisely what this film intends us to believe.Even worse a later courtroom scene has a character that is supposed to be Bugliosi revealing to a reporter how he will write a book about the trial while donating no proceeds to the victims' families. For writer and director John Roecker to have the audacity to suggest Bugliosi's bestselling novel was made solely for profit makes me wonder just how much of the profits from this movie were intended to be donated to any good cause let alone victims of savage murders.Everything about this movie doesn't work. You can tell when the movie is trying to be funny and it's painful to just listen to every attempt at humor. Every joke in this movie is poorly timed and is often mean and shallow.There are also repellent scenes where the stopmotion figures have sex and they're not funny either. The notorious puppet sex scenes in Team America World Police 2004 were funny because they were so over the top and outrageous similar to the Michael Baylike action movies the filmmakers were parodying. In Live Freaky! Die Freaky! the sex scenes are about as clever as a real porn film with money shots and all.I don't think I have ever hated a movie as much as I hate Live Freaky! Die Freaky!. The potential in its promise and its failing on all cylinders just adds to the disappointment. The filmmakers may be skilled at making great punk rock music but when it comes to making movies they are true rebels without a clue.";

And wow the animation is so terrible and often boring. Someone should have let the animators know that clay can't act unless you make it act and blinking doesn't count.Also it claims to have a lot of punk rock sensibilities but if you think Billy Joe Armstrong and Tim Armstrong have any punk rock left in them  you won't think so after this movie...If you are looking for something that looks funny and think this is going to be it you will be furious to find out this movie is not funny despite what it thinks.After the first big scene you will be bored for 70 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Heat Is On in the Maitland mansion's grounds one of the best action sequence entertainment and joy able watchable trough in tier film. I love love  love this film to death. The gun battle on mansion's grounds is one of the reasons to watch this movie. It is Commando and Rambo First Blood part II two action films in one. Axel Eddie Murphy Billy Judge Reinhold and Taggart John Ashton firing with handguns on Uziwielding henchman is the most entertainment trough in tier film. The final showdown between Axel and Zack Jonathan Banks is memorable gun shootout my favorite badass scene trough whole film.I love the rescue operation so it remains an action classic in the gunplay's fanatic dream with substance action and comedy. I love the filming location of Maitland's residence.Beverly Hills Cop 1984 remains Eddie Murphy's best film and people's favorite film in the series. It is my number 1 personal favorite Eddie Murphy film and of course remains my number 1 personal favorite in Beverly Hills Cop trilogy. I enjoy this movie it is my personal favorite action film from Eddie Murphy. This is people's favorite film in the trilogy and Eddie Murphy's best film and I Understand why. This is a childhood classic of mine I grew up watching it it was the first Eddie Murphy and only movie I saw as a kid. I didn't know they were three movies at the time  I only thought this is a stand up alone movie. I never saw the two sequels before or any Eddie Murphy movie at the time as a kid. This movie was when Eddie Murphy was at top oh his career when he just started making movie. Beverly Hills Cop has mixed elements with comedy and the same time entertaining action it has a lot of humor to laugh about. This is one of the decent's 80's action films they don't do movies like this anymore.Beverly Hills Cop Staring Eddie Murphy Judge Reinhold John Ashton Lisa Eilbacher Ronny Cox Steven Berkoff James Russo Bronson Pinchot Paul Reiser Jonathan Banks and Stephen Elliott and they all do fine job.Steven Berkoff is the main villain he was also in James Bond 007  Octopussy and Rambo First Blood Part II. They guy was born to play bad guys and I enjoy his performance in all three movies. Jonathan Banks was also in Eddie Murphy's first movie 48 Hrs. no Eddie and Jonathan they did not had any screen time in that movie together but 2 years later they reunited and they had screen time in this movie. Lisa Eilbacher as Jenny Summers close childhood friend of Axel was excellent one of her best performance ever she was also in Leviathan 1989 with Peter Weller. I love these trio working together Ronny Cox from RoboCop and Total Recall was excellent I miss the actor so much he was great. John Ashton was excellent and Judge Reinhold was great and decent as Det.

	onyx:emotionText "The Heat Is On in the Maitland mansion's grounds one of the best action sequence entertainment and joy able watchable trough in tier film. I love love  love this film to death. The gun battle on mansion's grounds is one of the reasons to watch this movie. It is Commando and Rambo First Blood part II two action films in one. Axel Eddie Murphy Billy Judge Reinhold and Taggart John Ashton firing with handguns on Uziwielding henchman is the most entertainment trough in tier film. The final showdown between Axel and Zack Jonathan Banks is memorable gun shootout my favorite badass scene trough whole film.I love the rescue operation so it remains an action classic in the gunplay's fanatic dream with substance action and comedy. I love the filming location of Maitland's residence.Beverly Hills Cop 1984 remains Eddie Murphy's best film and people's favorite film in the series. It is my number 1 personal favorite Eddie Murphy film and of course remains my number 1 personal favorite in Beverly Hills Cop trilogy. I enjoy this movie it is my personal favorite action film from Eddie Murphy. This is people's favorite film in the trilogy and Eddie Murphy's best film and I Understand why. This is a childhood classic of mine I grew up watching it it was the first Eddie Murphy and only movie I saw as a kid. I didn't know they were three movies at the time  I only thought this is a stand up alone movie. I never saw the two sequels before or any Eddie Murphy movie at the time as a kid. This movie was when Eddie Murphy was at top oh his career when he just started making movie. Beverly Hills Cop has mixed elements with comedy and the same time entertaining action it has a lot of humor to laugh about. This is one of the decent's 80's action films they don't do movies like this anymore.Beverly Hills Cop Staring Eddie Murphy Judge Reinhold John Ashton Lisa Eilbacher Ronny Cox Steven Berkoff James Russo Bronson Pinchot Paul Reiser Jonathan Banks and Stephen Elliott and they all do fine job.Steven Berkoff is the main villain he was also in James Bond 007  Octopussy and Rambo First Blood Part II. They guy was born to play bad guys and I enjoy his performance in all three movies. Jonathan Banks was also in Eddie Murphy's first movie 48 Hrs. no Eddie and Jonathan they did not had any screen time in that movie together but 2 years later they reunited and they had screen time in this movie. Lisa Eilbacher as Jenny Summers close childhood friend of Axel was excellent one of her best performance ever she was also in Leviathan 1989 with Peter Weller. I love these trio working together Ronny Cox from RoboCop and Total Recall was excellent I miss the actor so much he was great. John Ashton was excellent and Judge Reinhold was great and decent as Det. Billy Billy Rosewood he was the only one of the three actors that appear in all three Beverly Hills Cop movies.Great direction from Martin Brest his best direction debut ever. Great music score from Harold Faltermeyer for Axel F theme. I love the soundtrack Stir It Up by Patti LaBelle my favorite song of the film. Great opening sequence showing Detroit was excellent great action flick from Paramount.The first movie of Beverly Hills Cop Trilogy remains the best one in the series my personal favorite action film.";

It is still being admired by many people as one of the funniest cop movies ever made.The thing I love about this movie is that Eddie Murphy was perfectly cast as the Axel Foley character. Originally Sylvester Stallone was considered for the role. Thank God he wasn't! Eddie Murphy was perfect for the role because he can be a clever cop and can at the same time be very funny! Another great thing about Beverly Hills Cop is its smashing soundtrack. There are some great hit songs from the 1980's featured in the soundtrack as well as an excellent musical score which can be heard throughout the movie to me the musical score is the Beverly Hills Cop theme song.Perhaps the only downside of Beverly Hills Cop is that it can be pretty slow in certain scenes. Hardcore action fans would probably be disappointed by this. But let's face it Beverly Hills Cop is not an allout mindless action movie. It is actually a clever comedy with elements of action present within.To conclude Beverly Hills Cop is arguably Eddie Murphy's best film since he fits the Axel Foley character perfectly. There are many funny scenes featuring Eddie Murphy that will have people laughing even the action scenes can be cleverly funny! P.S Look out for cameos by Paul Reiser Bronson Pinchot and Damon Wayans!".

It is humor in this film but I am considering as a classic Action Film. It is definitely Eddie Murphy's best film. Film about Beverly Hills Cop and Cobra will not be today Action films like are this. I am really disappointed with how action films are turning today. Beverly hills Cop is a legendary film. A film that I will always cherish and I will never get tired of it. I love this movie to death. Great job reviewing one of the best classic action films ever.This is my favorite film and one of the best classic action films from the 80's of all time. Yes I grew up with this film that always fascinated me how this film is fascinated awesome brilliant and very funny. Eddie Murphy kick's ass!!! A freewheeling Detroit cop pursuing a murder investigation finds himself dealing with the very different culture of Beverly Hills. Beverly Hills Cop is a movie made successful entirely on the performance of its star. The film is fairly shallow when it comes right down to it  really it's a whole lot of talk a fair bit of comedy and only a little bit of action  but Star Eddie Murphy's 48 Hrs. charisma and complete mastery of his character is what makes Director Martin Brest's Midnight Run movie a fanfavorite success. Outside of Murphy Beverly Hills Cop is as routine as routine gets a standard copsandrobbers plot no mystery and pointandshoot and intheraw direction make for an otherwise dull picture but Murphy saves the film from its own shortcomings with so much flair and genuine excitement that this might be the alltime best of any of the actorsinglehandedlymakesthemovie movies. Beverly Hills Cop is the very definition of a star vehicle a movie that's nothing without its lead  this specific lead at that  but with him? It's a movie that's always masking its mistakes behind Murphy's big smile and quicktothepunch comic style and timing that he's got going on no matter the time place or circumstances in the story selling the character and his actions with a startling effortlessness that transforms him into Axel Foley in every scene. Axel Foley Eddie Murphy is a slick smoothtalking Detroit detective who's disobedience and disregard for procedure has once again landed him in hot water with his Chief and a promising career is on the brink of disintegration. Axel Foley is Eddie Murphy's best role that made him in to a star today. Beverly Hills Cop is a 1984 American action comedy film directed by Martin Brest and starring Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley a streetsmart Detroit cop who heads to Beverly Hills California to solve the murder of his best friend. Judge Reinhold John Ashton Ronny Cox Lisa Eilbacher Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks appear in supporting roles.This first film in the Beverly Hills Cop series shot Murphy to international stardom won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture  ComedyMusical and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing Original Screenplay in 1985. It earned 234 million at the North American domestic box office making it the highestgrossing 1984 film in the U.S.Beverly Hills Cop is always on the precipice of disaster the picture teetering on the edge but always pulled back from the brink by Murphy's contagious enthusiasm and pure comic timing. About half the film it seems is constructed almost exclusively of scenes featuring Murphy's character being chewed out for his actions that take place in the other half of the film. Whether he's defending himself in front of his superiors or defending his life on the streets of Detroit and Beverly Hills Murphy consistently and perfectly juggles the film's requirements for action as sparse as the action may be with what is almost always subtle but extraordinarily effective humor that always flows from the story and feels genuinely offthecuff rather than forcefed into the plot just to try and squeeze out a laugh from its audience. It's the film's sense of real genuine storytelling then that outside of Murphy is its greatest asset. The film is awfully standard yes but it's never mechanical instead playing as completely organic. The interplay between characters seems perfectly natural as does the humor and it's all thanks to Murphy's uncanny ability to carry the movie with so much natural swagger and charm that Beverly Hills Cop is so much fun in spite of what would otherwise be a forgettable loser of a movie. The heat is on in this fast paced actioncomedy starring Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley a street smart Detroit cop tracking down his best friend's killer in Beverly Hills. Axel quickly learns that his wild style doesn't fit in with the Beverly Hills Police Department which assigns two officers Judge Reinhold and John Ashton to make sure things don't get out of hand. Dragging the stuffy detectives along for the ride Axel smashes through a huge culture clash in his hilarious highspeed pursuit of justice. Featuring cameos by Paul Reiser Bronson Pinchot and Damon Wayans Beverly Hills Cop is an exhilarating sidesplitting adventure!I love this film it is one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen. Eddie Murphy rocks the house.".

	schema:reviewBody "Detroit cop Axel Foley Eddie Murphy is in Beverly Hills for a few days to investigate the murder of an old acquaintance. Axel assumes the suspect is a local tycoon but no one seems to believe him  including the police force being semirun by Ronny Cox in one of his rare goodguy roles.Axel comes into trouble with the law his first day on the job after getting thrown through a glass window by some thugs. He is arrested and when released finds himself hounded by a pair of inept police officers around the town for a few days. After outsmarting them in one of cinema's most delightful moments  ever Axel gets hooked up with an old friend and manages to roam the streets looking for clues  which of course he finds very easily.Before this film Eddie Murphy had starred in one film that had launched his name into Hollywood 48 HRS. But by all reasonable comparisons this is a much much better film and it's also much much funnier too. What's most refreshing is that it doesn't fall back upon the stereotypes of AfricanAmericans inherent in so many mainstream motion pictures  the role of Axel Foley was originally written for Sylvester Stallone who was actually attached to star early on in preproduction before dropping out of the project and it's quite clear that Foley was intended as a white character. Although massive rewrites were employed only two weeks before shooting script flaws can still be spotted  the heroine of the story is a white businesswoman for example and we expect some sort of sexual tension between them but there is none. We begin to question the very presence of the female lead because in essence it leads nowhere. We can imagine how it might have developed into a love story but Murphy works against the flow awkwardly treating her as nothing more than a friend.These sorts of things sometimes bring out the occasional odd touches in the film  ironically they unintentionally set the film apart from other such movies of the genre because it's not typical in any sense. Sure it has the routine shootouts but there is no romance subplot no pointless racial comparisons more of which would be seen in the two sequels etc. The movie greatly benefits from this because it seems so fresh and far more believable  after all rarely are romances developed in two days. The action genre always seems to end with the hero sending off the crooks to jail and finally getting a longawaited kiss from the leading lady. Beverly Hills Cop to its credit manages to avoid this and the result is a far more enjoyable film even if most of its sequences are far from being 100 realistic.The film's director Martin Brest has a clear handle on the buddy genre and would go on to direct the immensely successful Robert De Niro  Charles Grodin roadbuddiescomedy Midnight Run one of the most popular and best of the genre. Beverly Hills Cop works just as well  it's funny when it needs to be thrilling when it wants to be and features a stellar lead performance by Murphy in his most unusual role.Murphy is the driving force behind the film presenting us with a truly likable character  the most likable character he's ever played as a matter of fact. Axel is unorthodox but a generally good guy  Murphy is sometimes typecast into playing roles similar to that of which he played in 48 HRS. being the loud obnoxious racist who's got it all together but here he plays someone we actually want to root for. At one point in the film he manages to get a couple of police officers in trouble with their superior  but he takes all the blame and actually fabricates a lie wherein they were heroes doing their job despite the fact that they were all actually hanging out at a strip club. Axel is tough cool quickwitted nice sarcastic and likable  one of cinema's most enduring characters and proof that AfricanAmerican cinema heroes don't always have to be loudmouths in order to succeed as characters pay attention Chris Rock and Chris Tucker.The nowfamous soundtrack including 'Axel F' by Harold Faltermeyer is a great blend of technopop and electronic rock  the movie's theme is bouncy rambunctious and fun a good parallel to Axel himself.Overall Beverly Hills Cop exceeds exceptionally well even if a great deal of the film's success itself derives from pure accident and chance. I don't think anyone can say that those involved in the production knew exactly what they were doing at the time DVD supplements include anecdotes about hectic filming and the project almost falling through at one point  but as luck would have it everything turned out fine. Beverly Hills Cop is an immensely enjoyable film and one of the best examples of the copcomedy genre executed properly.".

Thank God that Sylvester Stallone backed out because I feel the film would have been a very dark intense film.  At least Murphy made Axel into a smart aleck who helped to lighten the mood of the film.  Also the one underrated performance has to have been Judge Reinhold.  Reinhold makes an art of playing slightly goofy out of it characters and his portrayal of Detective Billy Rosewood was a perfect example of that and John Ashton was the perfect foil as Taggart.  This is definitely one of the top films of the 1980's".

	schema:headline " Funniest combination of bananas and tail pipes in cinematic history...!";
	schema:reviewBody "Beverly Hills Cop is by far Eddie Murphy's most popular role and the movie that officially launched his career as a genuine movie star. It was one of those movies that my dad would let my brother and I watch on weekends after my mom made him promise not to show us any rated R movies and over the years it's easy to forget the level of violence and profanity in it that earned it that forbidding rating. Of course as a kid I was just excited that I was getting to see something that I shouldn't but in retrospect I tend to think that it was this combination of clever comedy and the ingredients from harder action thrillers that ensured Beverly Hills Cop's status as a cop comedy classic. You see Foley has a bit of a criminal past of his own but he is clearly much more at home on the right side of the law and he uses his experiences in crime to his advantage in working his way into the criminal underworld where he routinely attempts to bring down major crime ring kingpins. One day an old friend comes to visit him after having been released from prison and spending some time relaxing in the California sun. The two have a great time at the bar recounting their old criminal days together until we learn that this guy who once took the fall for one of Axel's crimes and served prison time for him without ever mentioning his name now has stolen bearer bonds with him worth millions. Before long the owner of the bonds shows up and is not in a reminiscent mood. Axel is knocked out as they're staggering back to his apartment for the night and he wakes up to find his friend murdered.The movie follows one of the biggest 1980s action movie clichs to the letter. Every single line is here 'take some time off' 'stay away from this case' 'if you go after this guy don't bother calling in on Monday' etc. My eyes tend to glaze over whenever I hear this situation in a movie probably because I work so much and in such situations can only think of how great it would be if my bosses told me to take some time off go on vacation don't let them catch me working or they'll fire me. But Foley's trip to Beverly Hills to perform his own investigation yields results so promising that it keeps the movie moving along at a pretty fast pace. Of course we realize the real life odds of a police officer traveling to the other side of the country and immediately stumbling across the major crime organization that he's looking for but Murphy's quicktalking wit and streetwise charm makes it pretty easy to root for him. The movie has the perfect premise to combine with Murphy's personality  he's an urban cop from Detroit named Axel Foley who is always driving his boss insane because he doesn't wait for piddly things like authorization when he wants to do major undercover work. The movie opens with one of these undercover and under the radar missions which culminates in the police being called and then a major car chase through city and residential streets that must have caused millions of dollars in damage. Of course when the cops have Axel at gunpoint he gives them a grin and they shake their heads and lower their guns. Aw shucks it's that crazy Foley again!Judge Reinhold and John Ashton play Detectives Rosewood and Taggart two of Beverly Hillss finest who are assigned to keep an eye on Foley and make sure he doesn't start doing police work while a dozen states or so outside his jurisdiction from which he's suspended anyway. So Foley moves around among the Ferraris and BMWs and Mercedeses of Beverly Hills in his ancient beat up Chevy Nova cheerfully laughing at Taggart's and Rosewood's bumbling efforts to tail him and doing his investigation right under their noses. In the standard buddy cop movie sitcom you have two wildly different people thrown together in a police partnership situation and forced to work together. This was a staple of the 1980s and has remained popular to this day with classic movies like Lethal Weapon Tango  Cash 48 hours one of Murphy's own earlier comedies Red Heat Rush Hour could two cops ever be more different than Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan? and possibly my favorite Hot Fuzz. And of course I shouldn't forget Bad Boys which may very well have so much in common with Beverly Hills Cop as to warrant suspicion of plagiarism. I'll let it go though. I'm sure Eddie Murphy doesn't mind. Anyway Beverly Hills Cop does follow all of the basic rules of your standard buddy cop movie but somehow manages to avoid feeling like a formula film. The combination of Axel's determination to avenge his friend's murder is juxtaposed with hilarious situations involving Taggart and Rosewood trying in vain to keep an eye on him as well as various police organizations tearing their hair out trying to keep him under control. Picture the police chief in Last Action Hero a bad movie for which I maintain a certain affection and make him intelligible and add a lot of profanity and you'll get some idea of what's going on here. I don't know that Beverly Hills Cop can quite be called a comedy classic but it is definitely an action comedy classic.Also keep your eye out for the hilarious cameo from Bronson Pinchot who you may remember as Balki from Perfect Strangers! Eleventh best TV show ever!".

	schema:reviewBody "Rather than having an incompetent Nick Nolte for a partner as in 48 Hours Eddie Murphy shows he can take control of a movie all by himself.  This was in the days when Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer were getting started in their modern appeal to the dollar.  It also proves to be the best.  Audio is skimped on as it always is in their movies but the highlight is the fact that Martin Brestpreviously fired off of WarGamesdoesn't let Bruckheimer get in the way of the story.Had a less competent director say Tony Scott or Michael Bay been put in charge the movie would have fallen apart like BHC II did.  Fortunately Brest knows how far to push things and when to back off.  He is helped by Arthur Coburn and Billy Weber two of the best editors short of Michael Kahn.  It's too bad that Arthur lost precedence in Hollywood and Billy wound up a slave to Bruckheimer.The charge in this movie is still strong after nearly 20 years but there are obvious signs of aging.  Thankfully the dialogue is not Bruckheimer's typical machoBS but rather natural and fluid.  Eddie delivers again and again.  The remainder of the cast obscure as they are fair but it is John Ashton who has the least trouble with his lines.The only major fault I find with BHC is not in the film itself but rather in how many times the formula has been duplicated mimicked plagarized and copied.  Each time less inventive or original than the rest.Overall funny and somewhat vulgar this is not for fans of Dr. Doolittle or The Nutty Professor but it shows when Eddie was at his pinnacle of ability...before the inferior screenwriters took over.  A gem of the 80s. 3.5 out of 5 stars.".

	onyx:emotionText "Rather than having an incompetent Nick Nolte for a partner as in 48 Hours Eddie Murphy shows he can take control of a movie all by himself.  This was in the days when Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer were getting started in their modern appeal to the dollar.  It also proves to be the best.  Audio is skimped on as it always is in their movies but the highlight is the fact that Martin Brestpreviously fired off of WarGamesdoesn't let Bruckheimer get in the way of the story.Had a less competent director say Tony Scott or Michael Bay been put in charge the movie would have fallen apart like BHC II did.  Fortunately Brest knows how far to push things and when to back off.  He is helped by Arthur Coburn and Billy Weber two of the best editors short of Michael Kahn.

The film is well cast all the way down to the smallest roles and Eddie is in top form but not enough credit has been given to the excellent screenplay.

What they actually did was take a classic fish out of water premise Eddie in Beverly Hills! and spin a wonderful variaion on it with rich lovable characters and creative use of language. The salty language in this movie is used in a way that stings more than actual violence does. Could Inspector Todd be any more menacing if he actually had a weapon in his hands? No. His mouth is the weapon. Every character in this movie all the way down to the Bronson Pinchot character has a unigue way with words. It's the screenplay not just the energtic acting that will alow this movie to stand the test of time.

Judge Reinhold and John Ashton play Axel's Beverly Hills counterparts.  Both pulling off fantastic performances and playing very enjoyable characters.  Ronny Cox also does a fine job with his role in the film.  Bronson Pinchot and Paul Reiser also deserve some notice as well despite having very little screen time they both make the best of it.  I'd also like to point a little known actor named Damon Wayans in the film playing an extremely small part but nonetheless a good one he's the man that gives Axel the bananas.As I mentioned before the action and the comedy are right on and the scenes flows very nicely together you never once get bored throughout the film.

Martin Brest on his own movie.It's easy to understand his feelings when you consider the endless changes made to Danilo Bach and Daniel Petrie Jr's script. They got an Academy Award nomination but the final product is a million miles away from what they originally conceived.Axel Foley was originally written for Mickey Rourke then it was geared around Sylvester Stallone who significantly rewrote the script further before abandoning the project a couple of weeks before shooting was scheduled to begin. Eddie Murphy was brought on board at the last minute and the script was rewritten yet again to form the movie we know today. Bizarrely all of the work Stallone did on the script was recycled into his reprehensible 1986 action movie Cobra which on top of being nothing at all like Beverly Hills Cop called itself an adaptation of a novel called Fair Game by Paula Gosling which it also bore littletono resemblance to. Nine years later that novel was once again made into a movie of the same name starring William Baldwin and Cindy Crawford which bore no resemblance to Cobra. When I say that Beverly Hills Cop had the biggest hodgepodge of a shooting script ever you better believe it.The story could not get any simpler. Young renegade Detroit cop Axel Foley forever tormenting his nononsense boss with his reckless antics meets up with a childhood pal only for him to be murdered that very night. Axel follows the trail and travels to Beverly Hills in his crappy bangedup skyblue Chevy Nova. It's a world away from the streets of Detroit. Even the patrol cops look like soap opera actors. Axel's fast and loose work ethic barely on the good side of the law doesn't sit well with the Beverly Hills police department. Detectives Taggart and Rosewood John Ashton and Judge Reinhold doing a Laurel and Hardy routine are assigned to keep an eye on Axel as he very quickly discovers the bad guy.No twists no surprises and barely a couple layers deep it's amazing that a story so superficial is able get 105 minutes of mileage. The film works thanks to Murphy's cheerful upbeat performance and Martin Brest's ability to keep it light. Beverly Hills Cop would not have worked as a dark thriller. Harold Faltermeyer's iconic score and worldfamous Axel F theme tune certainly help the happygolucky nature.There are certainly shortcomings. Steven Berkoff as Victor Maitland is completely unconvincing as the villain. In fact with the exception of Bennett from Commando he's probably the least threateningmost campiest villain I've ever seen in a movie. And as I have mentioned the story is very straightforward. Taggart and Rosewood do virtually no police work and are just bystanders watching and reacting to Axel's hustles. Apart from one cruise along Rodeo Drive we never really see or feel the glamor of Beverly Hills to juxtapose it next to the grime of Detroit. There are just too many interior scenes.But it never fails to entertain and is truly the highlight of Murphy's career. Once long before he sold out to family audiences his Rrated movies were huge business and Beverly Hills Cop showcases his leading man ability at its very best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ashes and Diamonds is both an essential historical film and a visual masterpiece. Set in the first days of Soviet occupation following World War II the film examines the moral dilemmas of the protagonist Macieka young rebel hitman in following through with the assassination of a leading communist party memberSczcukawho will soon be empowered as a means of forming a puppet communist government in Poland. The film is not limited to the perspective of the protagonist and alternates between the moral dilemmas of each of the characters in fulfilling predetermined Soviet agendas in the formation of a communist Poland. The visual composition of the film is as masterful as the complexity of the characters and plot. Despite the notoriously bad film technology in the Soviet states and the constraints of Socialist Realism the film manages not only to capture the potential richness of black and white but also manages to avoid the standard pitfalls of overzealous editing that often destroy other contemporary Soviet films. The frames are longer shots in general and forced schematization through editing is all but absent. The precise composition of each scene throughout the film provides the visual coherency that would otherwise be imposed by careful editing as an example see the scene in which Maciek is underneath the staircase in the lobby of the hotel towards the end of the film or the final Polish dance scene. I would highly recommend some research into the political transitions of Poland in the years directly following WWI before viewing this film for the first time this film was made for a particular audience who clearly understood certain cultural and historical references that a modern Western audience will inevitably miss ie. Were you in Warsaw?. The thematic and emotional complexity of the film is also enhanced by an understanding of Polish history. I would highly recommend this film for any class examining Eastern Europe or Soviet Russia which is the context in which I was introduced to this film in particular or to anyone who would like to better understand the complexity of Cold War politics from a perspective behind the Iron Curtain.".

	schema:headline " some people have to change roles";
	schema:reviewBody "At its most basic Andrzej Wajda's Popiol i diament called Ashes and Diamonds in English may seem to be a look at where Poland would be going after WWII ended. The plot involves young Maciek Chelmicki Zbigniew Cybulski who has helped expel the Nazis from Poland. With the Soviet Union now taking over the country he is ordered to shift his allegiance to them. Through Maciek's acquaintances with communist leader Szczuka and barmaid Krzystyna Ewa Krzyzewska a potentially explosive situation arises.If you know nothing about how the movie got made this seems to be the whole purpose. But there are other points. In a minidocumentary about the movie Andrzej Wajda and his collaborators explain how the novel on which the movie is based had Szczuka as the main character. Wajda not only moved the focus to Maciek  and gave him sort of a James Dean look  but also stressed the scene where Maciek talks with the man who fought in the Spanish Civil War. Apparently fighting like the man did is a Polish tradition. Therefore the film likely appeals to the Poles in almost every way the perfect Polish movie if you will.Although I've never seen any of Andrzej Wajda's other movies  hell I'd never heard of him until the Academy Awards gave him an honorary Oscar  I staunchly recommend this one. One can clearly see how he used the movie to subtly challenge the Soviet domination of his country of course they couldn't openly say anything against the USSR. Poland's proSoviet government had approved the movie but didn't want to let it outside Poland. Wajda got some people to smuggle it out of the country and it reached much of the world. Probably the most amazing scene is the end. I won't spoil the end but I'll note that blood on a white sheet looks a bit like Poland's flag a nationalistic statement.All in all a great movie. Andrzej Wajda has every reason to be proud of it.".

	onyx:emotionText "At its most basic Andrzej Wajda's Popiol i diament called Ashes and Diamonds in English may seem to be a look at where Poland would be going after WWII ended. The plot involves young Maciek Chelmicki Zbigniew Cybulski who has helped expel the Nazis from Poland. With the Soviet Union now taking over the country he is ordered to shift his allegiance to them. Through Maciek's acquaintances with communist leader Szczuka and barmaid Krzystyna Ewa Krzyzewska a potentially explosive situation arises.If you know nothing about how the movie got made this seems to be the whole purpose. But there are other points. In a minidocumentary about the movie Andrzej Wajda and his collaborators explain how the novel on which the movie is based had Szczuka as the main character. Wajda not only moved the focus to Maciek  and gave him sort of a James Dean look  but also stressed the scene where Maciek talks with the man who fought in the Spanish Civil War. Apparently fighting like the man did is a Polish tradition. Therefore the film likely appeals to the Poles in almost every way the perfect Polish movie if you will.Although I've never seen any of Andrzej Wajda's other movies  hell I'd never heard of him until the Academy Awards gave him an honorary Oscar  I staunchly recommend this one. One can clearly see how he used the movie to subtly challenge the Soviet domination of his country of course they couldn't openly say anything against the USSR. Poland's proSoviet government had approved the movie but didn't want to let it outside Poland. Wajda got some people to smuggle it out of the country and it reached much of the world. Probably the most amazing scene is the end. I won't spoil the end but I'll note that blood on a white sheet looks a bit like Poland's flag a nationalistic statement.All in all a great movie. Andrzej Wajda has every reason to be proud of it.";

	schema:headline " A superb intriguing complex drama";
	schema:reviewBody "When Germany surrendered in WWII on May 8 1945 there was much celebration in the West but the mood in Poland was not altogether jubilant  the Nazis had been defeated but the Soviet occupation was settling in for a long stay. The complexity of the political situation is reflected in this film but short of having been there or studied the history an encompassing understanding of the chaotic situation must remain incomplete I think. However this film is a great example of how focusing on the lives of a few characters in a single twentyfour hour period can illuminate significant historical facts in the context of an intriguing story.The characters are representative of the factions existing in Poland on the day of the German surrender. You have Maciek a resistance fighter who had opposed the Germans and was continuing the struggle against the communists Szczuka a Pole who embraced the communists and had become a party official Drewnowski whose sympathies were with the resistance but who hedged his bets by playing on both sides people sucking up to the new power structure for purely personal gain and most folks who were just trying to get by.Moral ambiguities abound raising issues with no easy answers. In an attempt to kill Szczuka Maciek mistakenly kills two innocent workers returning from a day of work at a local cement plant. Is continued resistance worth the sacrifice of innocent Polish lives? Maciek is conflicted about this and when Maciek's superior officer asks his superior if it is really necessary to kill Szczuka he gets a resounding Yes followed by the question Is this the Poland you fought for? Ordinary citizens bemoan the fact that any killing of Poles by Poles is wrong but the very existence of the resistance shows that there is no universal agreement on that. Though Szczuka may be on the wrong side he is not played as a villain and in fact he seems sincere in his convictions. You believe there is no evil intent when he says The end of the War isn't the end of our fight. The fight for Poland and what kind of country it is to become has just begun. Having met and become infatuated with the beautiful Krystyna Maciek is torn between giving up on the resistance and pursuing personal goals. But his superior officer's implication that to do so would be traitorous to the cause resonates with him and when he has an opportunity to kill Szczuka he casts his lot with the cause he has fought for  a cause he knows is probably doomed and will doom him. Better to die for a doomed cause you believe in than live a lie? Or is it better to work within the system in trying to achieve heretical ideals?Zbigniew Cybulski is a quirky but charismatic actor. His unexpected facial expressions and body movements create a unique memorable character. All the actors are good and the melancholy score is perfect for the mood of the film  it is reminiscent of some of the more plaintive works of Nina Rota.A most impressive aspect of this film is the black and white cinematography. Every scene is artistically composed and there are many scenes that achieve a stunning effect such as the one between Maciek and Krystyna in the ruined church with a lifesized crucifix hanging upside down and swaying to the sound of an eerie squeak perhaps suggesting that the church had been turned on its head or otherwise marginalized. The initial scenes also suggest the impotence of religion during this difficult time. When one of the innocent workers tries to escape Maciek's shots he seeks refuge in a church but the door is locked. After the door jam has been blown off the worker falls through the doorway revealing a mangled crucifix inside.This film encourages one to do a little study of Polish history. Poland lost over five million civilians in the war about three million of them Jews. This out of a population of thirtyfive million. Poland also lost over 400000 military personnel fighting for the allies about the same number that the United States lost. Total U.S. casualties during the war accounted for about a third of one per cent of the total population compared with a 16 loss of the Polish population. And in the end what Poland got for its sacrifice was a fifty year period of Soviet occupation. The segment of Norwid's poem that Maciek recites Will only ashes remain and chaos whirling into the void or will the ashes hold the glory of a starlight diamond? is particularly poignant in view of what happened.This film is in a league with the best black and white films of Bergman and Fellini.".

In Zbigniew Cybulski he has an actor who catches the director's personal feelings about the War and what has happened to his homeland his bravery struggling against the ambiguity and despair brought on by war weariness and soviet betrayal.  We see the sociology of the moment from the hotel clerk's nostalgia for Warsaw now ruined to the hardened barmaid who wants desperately to believe in love.  The whole spectrum is sampled from the ineffectual old leaders to the vicious soviet man who assists the targeted Sczcuka himself a decent but conflicted character.

	schema:reviewBody "The third in Director Andrej Wadja's war trilogy Ashes and Diamonds is set in Poland on the last day of WW2. The German High Command have issued their unconditional surrender and the Communists quickly fill the vacuum left by Hitler's goosesteppers and set up shop. Warsaw is lousy with rats and not all of them are of the rodent variety as power hungry bureaucrats jostle for position in the new order.Having spent the last half a decade under the Nazi junta the prospect of a future under Stalin's jackboot is met with keen opposition. Maciek a resistance fighter is ordered to kill a local Socialist party official which he is more than happy to do but soon discovers he has killed two innocent civilians instead.Maciek books a room at a rundown hotel where his quarry is staying. While he waits for the right moment to make amends he meets and falls in love with the barmaid Krystyna. His connection to the girl leads him to rethink his part in the endless cycle of violence.The central role of Maciek was played by the brilliant Zybigniew Cybulski who came to be known as the 'Polish James Dean.' Dean's death in a highway smash in 1955 meant he would never fulfil his promise and so would forever be frozen in movie goer's minds as a deeply troubled boy.

	onyx:emotionText "The third in Director Andrej Wadja's war trilogy Ashes and Diamonds is set in Poland on the last day of WW2. The German High Command have issued their unconditional surrender and the Communists quickly fill the vacuum left by Hitler's goosesteppers and set up shop. Warsaw is lousy with rats and not all of them are of the rodent variety as power hungry bureaucrats jostle for position in the new order.Having spent the last half a decade under the Nazi junta the prospect of a future under Stalin's jackboot is met with keen opposition. Maciek a resistance fighter is ordered to kill a local Socialist party official which he is more than happy to do but soon discovers he has killed two innocent civilians instead.Maciek books a room at a rundown hotel where his quarry is staying. While he waits for the right moment to make amends he meets and falls in love with the barmaid Krystyna. His connection to the girl leads him to rethink his part in the endless cycle of violence.The central role of Maciek was played by the brilliant Zybigniew Cybulski who came to be known as the 'Polish James Dean.' Dean's death in a highway smash in 1955 meant he would never fulfil his promise and so would forever be frozen in movie goer's minds as a deeply troubled boy. Cybulski was 30 when he played the role that made him and gives us a glimpse of what his western counterpart could have achieved. Cybulski's Maciek is a worldly wise vodka fuelled skirt chaser not a million miles away from his real life persona allegedly and far from being made twisted and bitter by his war experiences Cybulski plays the character as a man who laughs at the cruel joke of life that his been played on all of us and is determined to have fun and not be swindled even in the face of imminent annihilation.It was a conscious decision on Wadja and Cybulski's part that despite their story taking place in 1945 ASHES AND DIAMONDS' central character was going to be 'all out' 50's cool.

	schema:reviewBody "If Marty Scorsese tells you that 'Ashes and Diamonds' is one of his favorite movies it's likely that many will accept his viewpoint without a critical eye that is the power of the influential American auteur Mr. Scorsese. Of course it's easy to understand why Scorsese is enamored with the film mainly due to the 'Citizen Kanelike' cinematography and all those brilliant little 'cinematic' moments such as the film's iconic ending where antihero Maciek is shot and ends up in the fetal position on a trash heap. But despite the cinematic style that Mr. Scorsese so adores one cannot ignore the reality of the time in which the film was made and the compromises director Andrzej Wajda was forced to make.Ashes and Diamonds was released in 1958 and the English translation version in 1962. Poland of course was under the thumb of the Soviets and to give director Wadja the benefit of the doubt he was in no position to make a film that was critical of the Communists who were ruling Poland at the time. Thus Szczuka the Commissar who returns to Poland on VE day May 8 1945 and who is the subject of an assassination attempt by Home Army operatives at the beginning of the film must be depicted as a wholly sympathetic figure who has the best interests of the Polish people at heart. Szczuka is also a tragic figure who at the moment he's on his way to reconnect with his son a captured Home Army sympathizer who was raised by an antiCommunist aunt is unmercifully cut down by Maciek.What's missing here in this film is political context. Sure there may have been wellmeaning 'patriots' such as Szczuka amongst the Communists but what about the dark side of Communist rule? The Polish Home Army was the largest resistance group against the Nazis during World War II. The group was officially disbanded even before the end of the war in January 1945. A deal was made for thousands of former Home Army soldiers to receive 'amnesty' by the Soviets but instead after they accepted the amnesty deal they were rounded up and sent to Soviet gulags many never to be seen or heard from again. None of this important information makes its way into the film.Instead Wadja introduces a stock villain in the form of 'The Major' who was responsible for ordering the assassination of Szczuka but instead finds himself responsible for the murder of two innocent factory workers. Both assassins Maciek and Andrzej appear to be trapped in Wadja's view by bad karma. Andrzej asks the Major whether it's really necessary to kill Szuzuka but the Major won't entertain his question. And of course Maciek the brooding loner modeled on James Dean falls in love with a bar girl but ultimately can't run away and goes through with the murder of the kindly apparatchik.Most of the plot revolves around a banquet given for the local mayor in a hotel. While this is happening the plot to kill Szczuka slowly materializes as the backgrounds of each of the prinicipals is introduced. While the subplot involving Szczuka's son is somewhat interesting Wadja due to the constrictions of the time is not permitted a Szczuka counterpartone who shows the dark side of Soviet influence. As previously mentioned the Major is too Machiavellian without showing any of the other side's good points. And despite their 'sensitivity' Maciek and Andrzej end up as ruthless as their commanding officer.Perhaps Wadja's most interesting character is Drewnowski the informant who loses his job in the mayor's office after becoming completely intoxicated. Drenowski perhaps represents the 'common man' tragically caught between the two warring factions in Polish society at the time and unable to cope.Ashes and Diamonds may have represented some kind of breakthrough for Polish cinema at the time it was released. Here opponents of the ruling Communist government are treated with some sympathy as victims of some kind of inevitable and hence tragic karmic law. Nonetheless Wadja must ultimately throw the opponents of the ruling regime under the proverbial bus. A more nuanced and clearer picture of these opponents would ultimately appear following the fall of Communism. Scorcese is right in heaping accolades over Ashes and Diamond's style but its 'substance' is decidedly dated stuck in a time when people had to continually selfcensor thoughts and words which they wished to say.".

When the war came to an end in May 1945 however so too did the groups' shaky alliance and from momentary peace was suddenly sprung a whole new struggle for power. While a new Communist regime began to build its foundations in the shellshocked Polish cities the remaining Home Army rebels took to the forests where they dutifully continued their liberation campaign using guerrilla tactics. If WWII itself is considered necessary  or if not necessary then at least justified given the Nazi menace  then this postWar skirmish is the ultimate waste of life prompting murder on the grounds of mere ideology. In Andrzej Wajda's 'Ashes and Diamonds 1958' a weary Home Army youth Maciek Zbigniew Cybulski faces an internal conflict between fighting political causes and living a normal life not coincidentally the same dilemma facing the nation of Poland as the War came to a close.Wajda's film opens with an coldblooded ambush in which two concrete factory workers are needlessly gunned down in a case of mistaken identity. These shootings take place at the front steps of a country chapel and with a child within earshot highlighting the heartless resolve with which the Home Army rebels carry out their murders. However despite the proCommunist climate in which Wajda produced his film he stops well short of demonising the enemy rebels and indeed young Maciek is portrayed as the tragic victim of the story. In fact the film goes to some length to emphasise the parallels between Maciek and Communist leader Szczuka Waclaw Zastrzezynski implying the needlessness of their conflict and so the tragedy of their fatal opposition both men fought valiantly against fascist dictatorships the former in both Spain and Poland and remember fondly the war comrades who died in pursuit of an ideal that to both should now be deemed realised. Instead Szczuka dies in Maciek's arms as Poland celebrates its liberation.Polish cinema reached its peak in the late 1950s following the Khrushchev Thaw that saw an ease in Soviet censorship and Andrzej Wajda was at the forefront of this cinematic New Wave. Jerzy Wjcik's stark blackandwhite cinematography is elaborate and beautifullyexecuted capturing the main character's claustrophobic isolation using closed sets and a cramped frame. The war itself took many prisoners but Maciek  ironically a freedom fighter  finds his freedom restrained in a less overt manner. Even with the liberation of Poland Maciek is obligated to continue his blood feud denied the ordinary happiness offered by a life with pretty barmaid Krystyna Ewa Krzyzewska with whom he spends a night. Cybulski's character squanders most of the film in boisterous overcrowded surroundings finding room to move only in fractured moments such as a latenight stroll through the crumbling town ruins. Even in his death throes Maciek stumbles through a cluttered wasteland of garbage ultimately joining the detritus of the twentieth century's most costly conflict.".

Made in difficult times of hard state censorship it managed somehow to smuggle a picture of how complicated was the reality in Poland just after Second World War. Comparing to the book the plot is a bit reduced one important thread is discarded of an advocate who returned from German camp and he was outed by his time companion Szczuka  communist activist targeted for assassination  as a former kapo. The summary of the film on this site is misleading. It is not a film about fight of former partisan fellowmen. It is a film about a choice whether to remain in conspiracy and fight new regime or to go out from underground and start normal living as only it is possible.For sure the film is more valuable than a book. Might be watched although might be also hard to understand by a nonPoles.".

Comparing to the book the plot is a bit reduced one important thread is discarded of an advocate who returned from German camp and he was outed by his time companion Szczuka  communist activist targeted for assassination  as a former kapo. The summary of the film on this site is misleading. It is not a film about fight of former partisan fellowmen. It is a film about a choice whether to remain in conspiracy and fight new regime or to go out from underground and start normal living as only it is possible.For sure the film is more valuable than a book. Might be watched although might be also hard to understand by a nonPoles.";

At times I was laughing and wondering if Fellini had seen this parody of his approach to telling stories via cinema. I didn't read the book I watched this film eagerly with no previously held opinion one way or the other I have a large collection of Criterion type films and probably that's the reason I had never got around to watching Ashes  Diamonds. FWIW I watched it alone because I wanted to be in the tunnel so to speak.From the beginning there were no real surprises and it was apparent the director was going to be in a do you get it? mood. Much of the acting was either wooden or in a state of suppressed hysteria.As a chronicle of Poland's shock at not being victorious after years of hell this film deserves high marks for it's depiction of Poles making the best of a hollow celebration. As a potential awakening for both the assassin and his intended victim the film is entitled once again to high marks. As a love story much of it is well done.Then what's the problem? Too many cross currents many of which were just exercises in thrashing and flailing and for me I was looking for something to chew on and digest as opposed to being shown overly long drawn out scenes of either silliness or despair that's when it occurred to me I was not a member of the director's choir after a round of expletives I calmed down and thought of Fellini's and Bergman's approaches to developing a story and wished they'd made this film.".

	schema:headline " One of the greatest films in Polish cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is set on the last day and night of WWII in Europe. Poland is liberated from the tyranny of Nazi Germany and falls into the hands of Joseph Stalin. At the time the Poles were not sure what this meant but they feared the worst. The end of the war of course meant something quite different for Poland than it did for France or England. The liberation of Poland was just another invasion and occupation and the Resistance shifted targets from Nazis to Polish communists and in doing so went from heroes of Poland to criminals.The story follows Maciek a young Resistance fighter. His assignment is to assassinate a Polish Communist leader who is in town for a banquet to celebrate the end of the war and his subsequent promotion. It's a long night with lots of drinking reminiscence hopes and fears for the future and the unexpected crises of confidence that conflicts our protagonist Maciek. He falls for the beautiful young barmaid at the hotel and for the first time sees a different life for himself and questions what he is about to do. A heavy feeling of impending doom hangs over the film as the fates of people and a country are in doubt. Into this the director weaves some comical characters and a tragic romance. Good stuff.The look of the film is very expressionist as opposed to the neorealism which was a common style of directors in Europe at the time. The ideal was American Film Noir which the director was a big fan of  The Asphalt Jungle being his favorite. The entire hotel was built and lit artificially so they could create the look and feel they wanted. And there were a lot of very artistic purely visual effects and what some might call overly expressionist scenes a drunken polonaise at sunrise an upside down crucifix in a bombed out church a white horse wandering into the frame in a scene in the hotel courtyard. Beautifully photographed in shadowy black and white this film succeeds as a work of art on every level.The film is based on a book that depicted the assassination target Szczuka as the sympathetic figure. And really he's not a bad guy. However the director went the other way and made a minor character in the book Maciek the lead player. The role was played by one of the leading young actors in Poland Zbigniew Cybulski. The director let Cybulski keep his trademark long hair and dark glasses even though he knew no WWII resistance fighter looked like that. Even though the Party watchdogs made sure Maciek's ultimate fate was punctuated in another overly expressionist scene the Polish movie going public perceived the film as it was intended and Maciek was seen as the hero. Too late to censor the movie in Poland they were determined to not let it get out of Poland. They were successful in stopping it from going to Cannes but a Party Minister relented and let it go to the Venice Film Festival allowing it to be seen out of competition. It won the Grand Prize anyway Cybulski became the James Dean of Poland and the Party Minister was fired at the very least. The film is considered one of the greatest films in Polish cinema. 1010.".

I give many kudos to him for the excellent directing. The excellent plotting and symbolic imagery throughout the film made it an enigmatic experience. What a great move to open the film with such action! The first scene starts off things with such a bang and never lets you go! You are invested in every character even the relatively bad ones ie The Communist Guy. See this movie even if you know nothing about Poland in WW2 it's a great film anyway!".

	schema:reviewBody "I first discovered the enormity of the atrocities perpetrated by the Soviets in Poland through the nonfiction book The Captive Mind by Polish author Czeslaw Milosz. One of the things that stuck with me was that the Polish resistance members who fought the Nazis were not seen as heroes by the Soviets because those Poles were defending the old bourgeois order. So the old militaries and intelligentsia had to be killed to pave the way for a new state that upheld the values of the revolution.Andrzej Wajda captures this situation in Ashes and Diamonds adapting a novel by Jerzy Andrzejewski coincidentally one of the intellectuals Milosz devotes a chapter to and who served the revolution with a lot of faith and ardour. Still this is not a propaganda movie Wadja somehow managed to trick the censors into not seeing criticism against the way the Soviet Union betrayed the people who believe in its ideals.Actor Zbigniew Cybulski plays Maciek Chelmicki a killer working for the communists who receives orders to kill Szczuka a Communist leader. Although Maciek always found killing easy in the past now he has to kill a former soldier and one of the many who believes in the Soviet Union. Furthermore after falling in love with a barmaid he realises that his life is a cycle of violence and that he wants to put an end to it. What follows is a night of selfdiscovery for the young killer.Although I wanted to like this movie more a disjointed and often confusing narrative construction threw me off at several points. Cybulski is perfect as the killer though initially relaxed and thorough then as the night progresses he becomes introspective and melancholic. I also loved the cinematography especially the games between light and shadow. My favourite sequence was the murder of Szczuka. As he falls in Maciek's arms fireworks ignite in the sky celebrating the end of war Maciek runs away leaving the body by a puddle the fireworks reflecting in the water. His personal crisis and the celebration of an entire country come together and we know the future won't bode well for either.In free countries like Italy and France cinema revered communism. Movies like Novecento sound awfully dated nowadays. In countries where communism existed under no guises their movies have remained timeless. This is not just a condemnation of one of the most oppressive totalitarian regimes that ever existed but a depiction of human nature wherever ideals overthrow respect for life and dignity. Fiftyone years later Ashes and Diamonds remains modern.".

	schema:reviewBody "The third in Director Andrej Wadja's war trilogy Ashes and Diamonds is set in Poland on the last day of WW2. The German High Command have issued their unconditional surrender and the Communists quickly fill the vacuum left by Hitler's goosesteppers and set up shop. Warsaw is lousy with rats and not all of them are of the rodent variety as power hungry bureaucrats jostle for position in the new order.Having spent the last half a decade under the Nazi junta the prospect of a future under Stalin's jackboot is met with keen opposition. Maciek a resistance fighter is ordered to kill a local Socialist party official which he is more than happy to do but soon discovers he has killed two innocent civilians instead.Maciek books a room at a rundown hotel where his quarry is staying. While he waits for the right moment to make amends he meets and falls in love with the barmaid Krystyna. His connection to the girl leads him to rethink his part in the endless cycle of violence.The central role of Maciek was played by the brilliant Zybigniew Cybulski who came to be known as the 'Polish James Dean.' Dean's death in a highway smash in 1955 meant he would never fulfil his promise and so would forever be frozen in movie goer's minds as a deeply troubled boy. Cybulski was 30 when he played the role that made him and gives us a glimpse of what his western counterpart could have achieved. Cybulski's Maciek is a worldly wise vodka fuelled skirt chaser not a million miles away from his real life persona allegedly and far from being made twisted and bitter by his war experiences Cybulski plays the character as a man who laughs at the cruel joke of life that his been played on all of us and is determined to have fun and not be swindled even in the face of imminent annihilation.It was a conscious decision on Wadja and Cybulski's part that despite their story taking place in 1945 ASHES AND DIAMONDS' central character was going to be 'all out' 50's cool. Parts Brando Dean and Clift  Maciek in his army fatigues and 'sunglasses after dark' became a symbol for Polish teenagers who would emulate his style for years to come and his Anna Karennaesquire death beneath the wheels of a late night train in 1967 only exacerbated his legendary status. Even now we see shades of him in any number of Hong Kong 'glock operas' and John Cusack's 'assassin in Raybans' from Grosse Point Blank is a clearly a direct ancestor.Often charged with being overloaded with symbolism as scenes are obscured by upside down crucifixes characters rendered almost invisible in morning light whilst unfurling flags or inexplicably joined by white horses as they ponder the possibilities of a brighter future ASHES AND DIAMONDS makes no secret of its Expressionist credentials. The youthful hero dying on a mountainous rubbish dump to the accompaniment of screeching crows is an image lifted almost directly from Van Gogh's apocalyptic 'Crows over Wheatfield's'.Two years after Cybulski met his destiny on the snowy platform of Wroclaw station Wadja made EVERYTHING FOR SALE about an actor missing from the set of a film. The missing actor was clearly meant to be Cybulski who even in death dominated every scene. It still stands as probably the best film an actor never made.".

Parts Brando Dean and Clift  Maciek in his army fatigues and 'sunglasses after dark' became a symbol for Polish teenagers who would emulate his style for years to come and his Anna Karennaesquire death beneath the wheels of a late night train in 1967 only exacerbated his legendary status. Even now we see shades of him in any number of Hong Kong 'glock operas' and John Cusack's 'assassin in Raybans' from Grosse Point Blank is a clearly a direct ancestor.Often charged with being overloaded with symbolism as scenes are obscured by upside down crucifixes characters rendered almost invisible in morning light whilst unfurling flags or inexplicably joined by white horses as they ponder the possibilities of a brighter future ASHES AND DIAMONDS makes no secret of its Expressionist credentials. The youthful hero dying on a mountainous rubbish dump to the accompaniment of screeching crows is an image lifted almost directly from Van Gogh's apocalyptic 'Crows over Wheatfield's'.Two years after Cybulski met his destiny on the snowy platform of Wroclaw station Wadja made EVERYTHING FOR SALE about an actor missing from the set of a film. The missing actor was clearly meant to be Cybulski who even in death dominated every scene. It still stands as probably the best film an actor never made.";

	schema:headline " Gary  you're free";
	schema:reviewBody "The Smashing Pumpkins may have mused that 'The End is the Beginning is the End' but Edgar Wright knew better. He knew that for his beloved 'Cornetto Trilogy' he would need an ending that could somehow tie up all of its strains of manic voracious genre pastiche savage wit and silliness and most importantly its symphony to the reluctant aging of the schlubby post Shaun adult male. He knew he needed to do something special.So in the words of Shaun what do you mean DO something? Well getting the old gang together for a nostalgiafuelled 'one last job' pub crawl charged with more emotional weight and subtext than meets the eye should about do it. In this regard Cornetto 3 is by far the most personal mature reflective bittersweet and cognizant film in Wright's oeuvre. It knowingly winks at his past works don't forget to say hi to Brian Marsha and Tires listen for the fruit machine and enjoy an appropriately sly Cornetto cameo while introducing some of his most hysterically snappy wordplay yet maybe it's a windoor...!. And as no Wright film could ever be that straightforward it's also naturally about the end of the world. Duh.To some The World's End will be a cracking scifi pastiche  Invasion of the Body Snatchers handled with the chilly British terseness of The Day of the Triffids. To others it's a riotous boozy actioncomedy with a kickass set of tunes and prime viewing before hitting the pub or several with your mates. All of these things are true. But for me it will always be a film about growing up. A film about finding closure and purpose. A film about coming home and moving on at once. A film encouraging the Gary King in all of us to make peace with friends the past the future and ourselves. It's the perfect filmic encapsulation of playing James Bond video games in my adolescent basement. And it's a film about pursuing your dreams even  nay especially  if your dreams are pointless idiotic and involve a shtton of drinking.Things get going at an almost ponderously slow and repetitive pace forcing the viewer to be bludgeoned by Gary King alongside his estranged high school buddies into going on his quest with him. The tone is fun but with a bit of an edge Pegg bravely playing obnoxious at full tilt keeping it unclear as to whether you can or should like him. But upon arriving in the impossibly quaint Newton Haven and here Wright coins the most onthenose term for cultural assimilation and the dearth of familyrun local business Starbucking. Remember that theme it'll come in handy later things pick up and then some. Here King's raucous enthusiasm becomes almost worrisome especially in contrast with his bemused buddies all more content to act their ages. Thankfully the scifi framework comes to the rescue right when King is on the cusp of having to be serious. The solution like fellow extraterrestrial alcoholicomedy Grabbers? Keep drinking  to blend in of course. And as the Doors kick in that's where the fun really begins.Wright's characteristic swishpans and dynamic sound effects paired with some of the most intricately crunchy fight choreography seen in ages make The World's End thrilling in the most visceral sense. There's no purer cinematic joy than a longtake tracking shot of Pegg weaving in and out of a chaotic robot throwdown stepping on bar stools and counter tops sipping his pint and throwing the occasional like a tipsy Buster Keaton and it's impossible not to share in Wright's glee. The robot designs are eerily simple the pace and physical slapstick are howlingly perfect while the grim sepia lighting is perfectly atmospheric for the intensifying scifi peril and slurring melodrama unfolding. And the climactic belligerent belch of a speech demanding agency on behalf of the human race? I dare you to find more galvanizing words.Gary King is a courageously different Simon Pegg than has been unleashed before and his manic energy boundless but strained charisma and desperate arrogance make for his most achingly human but still hilarious creation yet. Nick Frost also digs into unforeseen dramatic meat pairing his juggernaut physical comedy with real pain and hardwon regret all the funnier for being so truthful. There's also a gag involving him literally punching a clock which may be the funniest in Wright's oeuvre. Paddy Considine and Martin Freeman collectively ace the two sides of the middleagedhipster coin postmeathead athletic emotional sensitivity and antiquated bluetoothed techspeak respectively while Eddie Marsan finds both huge laughs and the most raw hangdog pathos in the sweetness of Peter Page. Sadly in the film's only real fault Edgar's boys club has no proper room for Rosamund Pike and it's a real shame as she's on typically superb form and amiably hilarious to boot.

	onyx:emotionText "The Smashing Pumpkins may have mused that 'The End is the Beginning is the End' but Edgar Wright knew better. He knew that for his beloved 'Cornetto Trilogy' he would need an ending that could somehow tie up all of its strains of manic voracious genre pastiche savage wit and silliness and most importantly its symphony to the reluctant aging of the schlubby post Shaun adult male. He knew he needed to do something special.So in the words of Shaun what do you mean DO something? Well getting the old gang together for a nostalgiafuelled 'one last job' pub crawl charged with more emotional weight and subtext than meets the eye should about do it. In this regard Cornetto 3 is by far the most personal mature reflective bittersweet and cognizant film in Wright's oeuvre. It knowingly winks at his past works don't forget to say hi to Brian Marsha and Tires listen for the fruit machine and enjoy an appropriately sly Cornetto cameo while introducing some of his most hysterically snappy wordplay yet maybe it's a windoor...!. And as no Wright film could ever be that straightforward it's also naturally about the end of the world. Duh.To some The World's End will be a cracking scifi pastiche  Invasion of the Body Snatchers handled with the chilly British terseness of The Day of the Triffids. To others it's a riotous boozy actioncomedy with a kickass set of tunes and prime viewing before hitting the pub or several with your mates. All of these things are true. But for me it will always be a film about growing up. A film about finding closure and purpose. A film about coming home and moving on at once. A film encouraging the Gary King in all of us to make peace with friends the past the future and ourselves. It's the perfect filmic encapsulation of playing James Bond video games in my adolescent basement. And it's a film about pursuing your dreams even  nay especially  if your dreams are pointless idiotic and involve a shtton of drinking.Things get going at an almost ponderously slow and repetitive pace forcing the viewer to be bludgeoned by Gary King alongside his estranged high school buddies into going on his quest with him. The tone is fun but with a bit of an edge Pegg bravely playing obnoxious at full tilt keeping it unclear as to whether you can or should like him. But upon arriving in the impossibly quaint Newton Haven and here Wright coins the most onthenose term for cultural assimilation and the dearth of familyrun local business Starbucking. Remember that theme it'll come in handy later things pick up and then some. Here King's raucous enthusiasm becomes almost worrisome especially in contrast with his bemused buddies all more content to act their ages. Thankfully the scifi framework comes to the rescue right when King is on the cusp of having to be serious. The solution like fellow extraterrestrial alcoholicomedy Grabbers? Keep drinking  to blend in of course. And as the Doors kick in that's where the fun really begins.Wright's characteristic swishpans and dynamic sound effects paired with some of the most intricately crunchy fight choreography seen in ages make The World's End thrilling in the most visceral sense. There's no purer cinematic joy than a longtake tracking shot of Pegg weaving in and out of a chaotic robot throwdown stepping on bar stools and counter tops sipping his pint and throwing the occasional like a tipsy Buster Keaton and it's impossible not to share in Wright's glee. The robot designs are eerily simple the pace and physical slapstick are howlingly perfect while the grim sepia lighting is perfectly atmospheric for the intensifying scifi peril and slurring melodrama unfolding. And the climactic belligerent belch of a speech demanding agency on behalf of the human race? I dare you to find more galvanizing words.Gary King is a courageously different Simon Pegg than has been unleashed before and his manic energy boundless but strained charisma and desperate arrogance make for his most achingly human but still hilarious creation yet. Nick Frost also digs into unforeseen dramatic meat pairing his juggernaut physical comedy with real pain and hardwon regret all the funnier for being so truthful. There's also a gag involving him literally punching a clock which may be the funniest in Wright's oeuvre. Paddy Considine and Martin Freeman collectively ace the two sides of the middleagedhipster coin postmeathead athletic emotional sensitivity and antiquated bluetoothed techspeak respectively while Eddie Marsan finds both huge laughs and the most raw hangdog pathos in the sweetness of Peter Page. Sadly in the film's only real fault Edgar's boys club has no proper room for Rosamund Pike and it's a real shame as she's on typically superb form and amiably hilarious to boot.

With Shaun of the Dead 2004 and Hot Fuzz 2007 the trio demonstrated originality ingenuity and most significantly capable of drawing a large appreciative audience. Now they're back with the longawaited third movie of what's become unofficially known as the Cornetto trilogy. Like it's predecessors director Edgar Wright loves paying homage to American cinema Shaun pays its respects to George Romero Fuzz nods its head to over the top action buddy flicks and World's End takes a page from our classic American scifi films.In The World's End 20 years after attempting an epic pubcrawl five childhood friends reunite when one of them becomes hellbent on trying the drinking marathon once again. Once convinced to stage an encore by Gary King Simon Pegg a 40year old man trapped in the mindset of his mid 20's drags his reluctant friends back to their hometown and once again attempt to reach the fabled pub  The World's End.The World's End plays on the notion that any time you return to your old stomping grounds changes are inevitable. Upon returning to their small town rootsa place so boring it boasts about having the first roundabout in all of Englandthe crew notices that things are a little strange. As it turns out the town residents are now blue blooded alien robots. Pretty soon the group of friends find they are not only fighting to recapture who they once were but to preserve who they are.The World's End follows similar thematic and structural paths as the other films in the trilogy. While it is definitely intended as a satirical spoof on one level it also works just as well as a fully functional scifi story. You have elements of body snatching invasions and more than a few overt nods to John Carpenter's classic They Live 1998 in the way the aliens integrate into their society and take over. It's satire in such a loving fashion that it comes across as infectiously charming.If there is anything to criticize here maybe it's that the genre is a bit more skewered and less defined than in its predecessors. However The World's End does cap an unofficial trilogy and the grievance is overly critical given the nature of the movies. Longtime fans of the trilogy will appreciate the reversal of roles casting Pegg as the selfish screwup and Frost as the one who has it together. This allows Pegg to fully unleash his gift for gab and for Frost to show off his considerable skill for physical comedy.With great gags better fights and fan pleasing cameos The World's End is exactly the sort of Britishaccented genreblending pleasure we've come to expect from its creative trio and we can only anticipate to what the future holds.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you're the third film in an unofficial trilogy that includes Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz then there is a lot of pressure on you to maintain that quality and unfortunately this film doesn't do that. There are good aspects to this comedy but not enough of it really comes together well enough to make it stand up to the previous two films. The plot here sees Gary King trying to reclaim happiness by convincing a group of his friends to revisit the good old days by going on a pub crawl they attempted when their lives lay ahead of them and they felt full of potential. However when they do return to their home they feel like they have changed too much and should never have come back  but they are only half right because they should not have come back although it isn't them that has changed.I like the ideas behind this film. On one hand we have a scifi movie which owes its debts to 1950's America while on the other we have a very British plot involving a pub crawl and someone who can't let go of the time in his life where he felt important and potent  a time which has left him behind and now appears a bit pathetic to still be trying to be the person he was rather than just moving on. This is a nice idea and it is one that occasionally goes somewhere but far too frequently it doesn't and it isn't consistently applied. It also doesn't help that Gary himself is a wholly unlikeable character writing this type of person to work as someone we support is hard and the script never achieves it it never consistently shows the cracks to the extent that you feel for him. Many of us will have a small part of Gary in us but the film never reaches it. It also doesn't help that the film seems to take his side at the end as well.This gives us the scifi side and it does work better as an all out comedy scifi the fight scenes are silly but yet well done and the action is quite engaging. That said it never feels grounded in the dreary British reality in the way that Hot Fuzz and Shaun managed to do so very well so while it is decent it never feels as clever or as special as the previous two films. It does have laughs and the film does have good elements so I don't think it is bad just that it isn't really anywhere near as successful as it needed to be. The cast are mostly good but the material doesn't make the most of them. Pegg is the lead has the toughest character and really can't make it work  not all his fault but still. Nick Frost is better because his character is simpler and he is fun in the action sequences. Marsan Considine and Freeman are better actors than the material they get given here  likewise the many familiar faces in support from Brosnan down to Oram although they do OK.The World's End is not a bad film and if you liked the previous films then you'll be more likely to find things to enjoy here  but chances are you'll still feel a little disappointed as the aspects that made the previous films work so well don't really come together with this one.".

Frost is kickass lovable. It's strength is that you care about the fate of the characters. The supporting cast are excellent including surprisingly well cast Rosamund Pike Martin Freeman to name a few and a surprise cameo by an exBond.If Shaun was on the money and Hot Fuzz was wordy The World's End is somewhere in between.

With fantastic direction from Edgar Wrightsmart writing from Wright and Simon Pegg and hilarious performances from Pegg Nick Frost and everyone else the World's end is a great way to end the trilogy. The story focuses on a group of childhood friends who go back to their hometown in order to repeat a legendary pub crawl that ends with a pub known as the World's End. However they realize that their whole town has been taken over by robots and it's up to them to stop them from taking over the world. I will admit that my only criticism of the film is that it does start off a little slowly. The jokes felt a little stiff at times with their execution and most of the humor was coming from Pegg's character. However once the robots come in the movie does pick up the pace and lives up to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz The performances are very funny with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost actually switching roles. Pegg is more of the bumbling idiot whereas Frost is the straight man. The other performance are also good with Martin FreemanPaddy Considine Rosamund Pike and Eddie Marsan. I also loved the ending which has probably the best ending out of any of the Cornetto trilogy movies Overall the movie is incredibly funny despite having a slow start. It's a perfect mix of comedy and science fiction. I hope there's more to come from these very funny and talented guys.".

	schema:reviewBody "Five premiddleaged male friends are drawn to Newton Haven the site of their failed dozenpub crawl as students in 1990. They're led by Gary King Simon Pegg. He's the one who couldn't move on from that night couldn't get a job like them or get married like them. Reluctant revelry and badtempered banter ensues before the gang discovers that the residents of the town have changed. That is they have BEEN changed...The World's End is considerably better than the ostensibly similar This Is The End a superindulgent American comedy which mistook fbombs for humour and namedropping for satire. Edgar Wright's film is indulgent also but at the service of audience enjoyment as opposed to the enjoyment of the players. The script is surprisingly dense and intricate many of its jokes arriving bittersweet. In an era when so many comedies are heavily and lazily improvised it's refreshing to watch a tightly woven story unfold for once.The action scenes are given equal attention lovingly choreographed like some kind of slapstick dance. Chief pugilist is Andrew our sortofhero played by Nick Frost with remarkable agility. This instalment is far less bloodthirsty than its predecessors  more Scott Pilgrim than Shaun.The rest of the group is made up of Paddy Considine Eddie Marsan and Martin Freeman. The performances are all topdrawer although it takes time for their individual personalities to emerge. But then the fact that they are now practically indistinguishable may be the point  for all their disapproval of Gary they are the ones playing it safe.What's most impressive about The World's End is the fact that it's actually about something. Nostalgia is easy to indulge but difficult to deconstruct but this film genuinely aspires to explore the idea of selective memory  as with a bad hangover our memories tends to return in subjective spasms and the truth is only accessible by gathering multiple witnesses.

	onyx:emotionText "Five premiddleaged male friends are drawn to Newton Haven the site of their failed dozenpub crawl as students in 1990. They're led by Gary King Simon Pegg. He's the one who couldn't move on from that night couldn't get a job like them or get married like them. Reluctant revelry and badtempered banter ensues before the gang discovers that the residents of the town have changed. That is they have BEEN changed...The World's End is considerably better than the ostensibly similar This Is The End a superindulgent American comedy which mistook fbombs for humour and namedropping for satire. Edgar Wright's film is indulgent also but at the service of audience enjoyment as opposed to the enjoyment of the players. The script is surprisingly dense and intricate many of its jokes arriving bittersweet. In an era when so many comedies are heavily and lazily improvised it's refreshing to watch a tightly woven story unfold for once.The action scenes are given equal attention lovingly choreographed like some kind of slapstick dance. Chief pugilist is Andrew our sortofhero played by Nick Frost with remarkable agility. This instalment is far less bloodthirsty than its predecessors  more Scott Pilgrim than Shaun.The rest of the group is made up of Paddy Considine Eddie Marsan and Martin Freeman. The performances are all topdrawer although it takes time for their individual personalities to emerge. But then the fact that they are now practically indistinguishable may be the point  for all their disapproval of Gary they are the ones playing it safe.What's most impressive about The World's End is the fact that it's actually about something.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a huge fan of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Shaun of the Dead is almost flawless and though Hot Fuzz is kind of slow and suffers a little from some stupid moments not stupid funny just stupid it's extremely charming and interesting from start to finish.The World's End starts off pretty strong halfway through hits a point that blows your mind to pieces then pretty much dies.The biggest problem to me is that the movie suffers from tensionless fight scenes that show the main middle aged drunken characters killing everyone and everything that fights them effortlessly. There was a huge effort put into choreography for martial arts fight scenes but it instantly sucked the charm out of the movie.Yes I know it's a comedy. But Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz worked so well as movies because what was happening though funnywas actually very tense and realistic. The zombies and townspeople actually posed a threat and they struggled to overcome them. The humor came from people behaving like people in those given situations. The fight scenes in this movie drag for so long and just aren't very interesting except for the pint spilling joke.Also there was a few moments when I just felt they could have written it a bit better. Peter falls behind in the woods and stands there talking to a threatening robot as all of his friends walk away and this is a long time after they know they are being followed. He dies and no one really cares. Then near the end the entire town is chasing them and the robots are literally in front and behind them but yet still don't manage to stop them. And if they're robots wouldn't they have brain power to calculate record and send what they are doing to one another. How did they manage to lose them? It all just seems like a bad idea for a film. I was really enjoying it until the robot story began.The final reveal of the movie is also pretty terrible. They literally have to explain it for 5 minutes and it's just stupid and adds more holes and stupidity to the plot.It definitely had some hilarious moments but for the most part I was just not interested and the main characters didn't seem to care that their friends were dying and being replaced so why should I.Worth a watch but I'll never watch it again.".

The only downside to this film some may see is that the gore is not traditional being robots. The style of violence in Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz shine through with just a bit of a blue tint. The characters are just plain lovable and hilarious in their own ways. Most of the laughs in this film came straight from dialogue of characters rather than visuals.

	schema:headline " A Film About GrownUps Looking Back... Made by GrownUps Looking Back";
	schema:reviewBody "The World's End is about characters who have grownup but are drawn back into their younger years. Immediately it seems this is a comparison that can be made with Edgar Wright Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in their making of this film.For me Gary King played by Pegg represents the youthful side of both the film's characters and of Pegg Frost and Wright fun playful reckless but forgotten and moving away from. However once coerced into reminiscing it all comes back.This is reflected in the film itself which starts off rather slow and dry and surprisingly isn't as funny as what it ought to be. So although it does take a bit longer to get going than may be desired once it does the laughter flows freely pretty much right through until the end of the film. I have no hesitations in saying it is a funny film.However while the laughter is mostly consistent  coming from another fine Pegg and Wright script  the final 1015 minutes are in fact a bit clunky and longwinded despite containing some of the most heartfelt moments of the trilogy.Nevertheless it is a joy to see Pegg and Frost onscreen together again. They crack jokes left right and centre as we are used to but due to Gary and Andy's Frost rocky relationship it's not often with each other. This lack of warmth in their relationship though a bold change from the previous films does strain at times and presents a rather unwanted opposite here and there to what we are used to  friends fun immature. There are in effect 5 leads which does sometimes hinder the PeggFrost doubleteam.However since there are 5 leads this patch is mostly covered up. Martin Freeman Eddie Marsan and Paddy Considine do an excellent job as King's highschool buddies the latter in particular  Considine is a gem.The World's End is the strongest film thematically in the Cornetto Trilogy. It's about adulthood vs adolescence regret friendship and above all the state of modern society. It does not nod nearly as much towards or satirise genre like Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. No instead the nods and satire are mostly out and the themes are in.This is halfwelcome halfdisappointing for the final film of the trilogy. On one hand since the other two satirise film genres it is odd the this doesn't and honestly a bit disappointing. This is much more of it's own beast but for a Pegg Wright and Frost film it does feel far too much of an unexplored area. On the other hand the concerns of the central plot and the thematic content give the film the strength to round off the trilogy in a fitting and appropriate way.Furthermore The World's End contains many of the little recurring elements from Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz which show such loving attention to detail and continuity the Cornettos the Wright shortshot montages the fantastic soundtrack the amazing use of the word 'Ct' the noise of the pub fruit machine and many other little details that have made appearances in the previous two films are here.Not only are these recurring details present but so too are some of Wright Pegg and Frost's collaborators with their own fantastic cameos. I won't give any away specifically but there are actors from previous films in the trilogy and beyond stretching back to Spaced here making appearances and it's actually rather heartwarming. Evidently roots have not been forgotten.However the impressive camerawork of Shaun of the Dead with it's long Steadicam tracking shots and Hot Fuzz the wellstudied and executed shots deriving from the action blockbuster genre was not as present this time round. In The World's End the CGI gets in the way too often for the camerawork to shine and this is most apparent in the film's several fight scenes. Fun though they are they seem offkilter and as if they have been tinkered with a little too much. Though I don't think it is as adventurous with the camerawork it is still a fine looking film which I credit with Edgar Wright's choice to continue shooting on film instead of digital. Despite what may appear to be a lot of grumbling with The World's End it is still very accomplished and probably one of the better films I will see this year. Is it funny? Certainly without a doubt. Is it as funny as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz? Not quite. And it is the memory and affection for these two films and the frankly unavoidable and inevitable comparisons between them which unintentionally hurt The World's End. The influence of these two films on the other hand  how they got where they are to make this film  has undoubtedly not been forgotten. However the plot itself and the more heavy thematic content in place of the fun snappy genre references give Pegg Wright and Frost the air of saying that there will always be time to reflect have fun and cherish the memories of younger more immature days but that they are older and more mature now and it is time to move on though I don't wish suggest that they wanted this film done and out the way  a lot of love clearly went into it as with the whole trilogy. If this is the message we are to be left with I will say that is a fitting way to end any a trilogy.A desire for just a little more immaturity and laughter lingers over The World's End nevertheless but it is still a very good film one I would not hesitate to recommend and I am forever grateful to Edgar Wright Simon Pegg Nick Frost and the rest of their crew for completing an unforgettable trilogy.".

I got to see this at a Cornetto Trilogy marathon comprised of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz leading up to the 1000 PM premiere of the film and EVERYONE had an incredible time. Everyone. First thing's first is a comedy so is it funny? FROM START TO FINISH! And surprisingly it's actually very heartfelt. The characters are very likable even if they're rude and belligerent they have a good side to them and there is an argument between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost towards the end that was actually very moving. This film never sacrifices a character or plot point to make a joke just like the other films in this trilogy and that in itself shows the care here. A lot of movies are just mindless fun but this is actually smart and it in turn makes it so much more fun.Edgar Wright's timing and ability to create terrific fight scenes are as good as ever and of course Simon Pegg Nick Frost and all others are just fantastic. And let me say something these special effects are stellar throughout and it only cost 20 million? Truly wellspent. I just can't wait to see this again.And note I am not comparing this to Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz which are my two favorite comedies of all time because each entry in the Cornetto Trilogy is so different and all of them are truly exceptional. I will however compare it to everything else this year and it's the secondbest movie of the year behind Stoker.9.710 amazing two thumbs up far above average etc.".

This time around the boys are battling an army of killer robots. Simon and Nick have switched roles for this film in which Simon plays the bumbling idiot. Simon recruits his old high school friends to conquer an epic night of drinking that they failed to do years prior however now everyone is grown up except for Simon's character who still lives in the past. However they soon realize the town has been taken over by a sinister robot army. Basically if you enjoyed either Shaun of the dead or Hot Fuzz you will love this film. Hot Fuzz is my favourite comedy of all time so far however i would rank this movie right up there with Shaun of the dead. The humour in this film is very subtle compared to their previous two films. They try some new things with this film and the result is a crazy mass effect inspired ending. This is a great film to end the summer and while it may not be everyone's cup of tea it will surely be a cult classic in time.Rating 810".

The satiric story is originalfun and makes for the funniest film in the cornetto trilogyI mean I laughed hard more times in this then I did Hot Fuzz. The characters are easily the best thing in this movie cause you probably know someone like them.

They soon realize that reaching their final pubThe World's Endmay be the least of their troubles. They're having the time of their livesready to take on the world...but tonight they might have to save it. This film is a cornetto film at heart but it spends more time on it's satiric look on science fiction and it's characters first. We still get those fence jokesa cornetto reference and lot's pf pints. The satiric story is originalfun and makes for the funniest film in the cornetto trilogyI mean I laughed hard more times in this then I did Hot Fuzz. The characters are easily the best thing in this movie cause you probably know someone like them. Everything you could want in a comedy is herethe actionthe laughsthe lovethe cartoonish stuff going on if you want to grab a group of friends and have a good time I recommend you go to The World's Endwhich I'm giving a five out of five.";

The World's End is an actionpacked scifi comedy where a number of familiar faces return to help Gary King Simon Pegg achieve his lifelong dream and complete the 'golden mile' in their hometown of Newton Haven. Five guys 12 pubs 60 pints!I'd written a paragraph about the character's we see from previous films but that'd spoil it a little. You're welcome. I think part of the fun is spotting these for yourself and realising how close knit the cast are... so moving swiftly on!As you'd expect the film was cleverly written and it was a lot of fun to watch. However there's a reference a minute to Edgar Wrights previous work which for fans isn't a bad thing but newcomers to the trilogy will struggle to keep up.Within the film there are a number of stories and ideas going on here but don't let us spoil it for you. The World's End is out now and for veterans of the trilogy well worth a watch! Nick Frost was a highlight for me playing a different type of character this time round and for the better. Usually the happygolucky friend he plays a much more complex and leader type role. With so many other great names in the film there was a risk that Nick Frost could fall in to the shadow of Martin Freeman Paddy Considine or Eddie Marsan who was awesome by the way... but he doesn't. This is Frost's greatest film yet.If you haven't seen Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz it might be hit or miss so check them out before this... it is the end of a trilogy after all! Watching The World's End first would be like watching Return of the King and even though they're unrelated you'll feel left out when everyone starts laughing at a fruit machine playing in the background and you have no idea why.The film will do well regardless how good it is  it was a great ending to the trilogy that started almost ten years ago. These have put British cinema on the map. And even though it's a mixed review ranging from a 6 to a 9 out of 10... the golden mile sounds like a great idea  who's up for it? DW.".

To say that it fell somewhat short of it's goal is putting it mildly but it's not bad. The plot is of course the familiar story with a few expected variations. When his father dies poor Fella Lewis is left at the mercy of his snobbish stepmother Judith Anderson and her two nogood sons Maximilian Henry Silva and Rupert Robert Hutton. As he slaves away for his nasty stepfamily Maximilian and Rupert attempt to find a treasure Fella's father has supposedly hidden on the estate. Meanwhile hoping to restore her dwindling fortunes the stepmother plans a fancy ball in honor of the visiting Princess Charmein Anna Maria Alberghetti whom she hopes will marry Rupert. Eventually Fella's Fairy Godfather Ed Wynn shows up to convince him that he has a shot at winning the Princess himself. Lewis had big plans for the film's release. Although it was completed in January of 1960 he insisted it make it's debut that Christmas complete with a holiday campaign and record album tiein. In the meantime he produced and starred in a low budget item called The Bellboy in order for Paramount to have a Jerry Lewis movie for summer release. Cinderfella was given a lavish production and a formidable supporting cast was recruited to co star with Lewis. He was indeed fortunate to obtain the services of Judith Anderson who while not a performer one would expect in a Jerry Lewis film was nevertheless excellent as the stepmother bringing just the right touch of arrogance to the part. Ed Wynn is reliably daffy as the Fairy Godfatherthough due to severe editing he disappears before the climax and is not seen again. Silva and Hutton do what they can as the stepbrothers but the beautiful Alberghetti has nothing to do but fall hopelessly in love with the hapless Fella. The pace of the film is somewhat choppy and several critics pointed out that the editing had left voids in the plot. The film originally ran 99 minutes it ended up at 88. Sure enough it was released at Christmastime when it inspired some of the most scathing critical comment ever bestowed on a Lewis picture. Most of this was devoted to Lewis' own performance and his frequent mugging mixed with his pathetic attempts to play for sympathy. Cinderfella did just O.K. at the box office and it ended up well behind the modest Bellboy which was a boxoffice smash. Thanks to handsome sets with exteriors filmed at the Beverly Hillbillies estate in Bel Air CA costumes and a pleasant if unmemorable score Cinderfella is entertaining enough to get by. But you'd better be prepared for a lot of singingmugging from the ProducerStar who fancied himself a brilliant vocalist. After all though this is SUPPOSED to be a fairy tale!".

	schema:reviewBody "Decades before there was a Jim Carrey the movies unleashed another inspired nut case  Jerry Lewis  whose 50s and 60s Paramount Studio vehicles tended toward an oilandwater mix of outrageous physical comedy and mawkish sentimentalism.  1960's Cinderfella is a casualty of that uneasy blend.Taking the classic fairy tale and tailoring it to fit his talents the stretchfaced rubberlimbed comedian portrays Fella a poor imbecilic ostracized stepson who lives only to serve his cruel absurdly wealthy stepmother Judith Anderson and her two greedy sons Robert Hutton Henry Silva in their palatial mansion.  The only reason they even allow Fella to still bunk at the mans his bedroom is more the size of a closet is that Fella's late father has hidden a vast fortune somewhere on the grounds of the estate and the stepkin think the dolt may know where it might be hidden.Jerry is priceless when it comes to engineering clever complex highenergy sight gags.  A testament to his versatility here is his miming flutist scene as he listens to a ditty on the radio in the kitchen one of my all time favorite Lewis routines.  The dinner scene where he caters to his family at an absurdly long dining table is another ingenious moment.  Sprinkled throughout too are numerous welltimed bits like the reading of the inscription off his father's ring or the frequently used haircombing bit etc.  But too much of the time Jerry bogs the scenes down with cheap slick sentimental mush.  He gets what I call telethon tender on us  trying to work our heartstrings instead of our funnybones.I remember the Marx Brothers having the annoying habit of breaking up their frantic comedy skits with straight musical numbers sung by some insipid ingenues that always took away from the fun.  Same problem here...only worse!  Lewis incorporates HIMSELF a very mediocre singer into these cloying musical numbers and ten times out of ten they don't work.  In Cinderfella he allows himself no less than FOUR soporific songs to indulge in with one of those numbers some silly nonsense about being a people instead of a person just unbearable.  Jerry the Clown sells Jerry the Lounge Lizard doesn't.Judith Anderson is appropriately huffy and haughty and Henry Silva and Robert Hutton make a fine pair of oily villains while proving good sports too as the unwitting victims of some of Jerry's mishaps.  But the late great Ed Wynn is wasted here as the Fairy Godfather mired in those gooey scenes I was talking about before.  The demure exceptionally lovely Anna Maria Alberghetti who complements the lavish surroundings appears too late in the proceedings to make any difference as the Princess Charming character who for whatever reason is smitten by the ungainly Fella.  By the time she arrives the film has lost its charm and humor and we have lost our patience.  It's too bad she didn't get to sing instead of Lewis.I know it sounds like I'm not a fan at all of Jerry's but I am!  Like many producerdirectorstars of his calibre their egos get the best of them. Like Elvis Presley most of his vehicles were not up to snuff. And in the case of Cinderfella Frank Tashlin may be credited with directing but I think we all know who the director REALLY was on this set.For those who appreciate Jerry as only the French can I would suggest The Disorderly Orderly The Ladies Man and his most popular The Nutty Professor to get a better feeling of this man's  genius.".

I had a very hard time getting into his work.  However when he went out on his own I really became interested in his work.  I would like to make mention of some things I found very interesting and very funny in this movie.  For example instead of a fairy God mother like Cinderella had he had a fairy God father.  He also read approx. 50 words when reading the inscription on the ring given to him by his deceased dad.  Like Cinderella Cinderfella was a loving hardworking and honest person who was treated unfairly at first.  He waited on his step mother and step brothers hand and foot.  I happily remember when he went to the kitchen to make orange juice and proudly put his hand out the kitchen window pulled in a tree branch took a knife and cut off several very large orange to use in the juice.  I thought it was creative to have him listen to the radio and act out playing the flute.  I loved it.  But like Cinderella Cinderfella was rewarded in the end for all his hard work.  I waited with excitement to see how he would get to the ball and loved what the writers came up with.. And when he made his grand entrance into the ball I couldn't help notice what a smooth dancer Jerry Lewis really is. I thought the music was beautiful.   After I saw this movie I had such a warm loving feeling in my heart and I really thank God for this touching comedy.  Jerry Lewis is the funniest actor in the world and his shoes glass or leather that is will be very hard to fill in the future.  Thank You.".

Jerry moves beautifully across the screen utilizing all 63 steps  all to the sound of a sexy Count Basie number. His moves seem perfectly syncopated to the music. It's a wonderful scene. And as Jerry has said all done in one take  which seems perfectly believable when you then hear his voice crack slightly upon taking the princesses hand Excuse me....I do like watching Jerry squeeze the oranges in the kichen. An ordinary task made funnier by his body language and goofy faces. And of course the long protracted dinner table scene  switching jackets running back and forth the salt in the soup  great stuff.The rest of the cast are good too. Henry Silva is wonderfully slimy as Jerry's conniving brother. And the beautiful Anna Maria Alberghetti is perfectly cast as Princess Charming. Though I wish the big dance number with Jerry had shown more of her.There are some very funny scenes and as sappy as the story gets it's rather sweet Keep breathing fish!. Considering that Jerry had already been in his hugely successful act with Dean Martin where most performers would have retired it was quite an accomplishment to have started carving out a solo career.This man may have his flaws but Jerry Lewis is priceless.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you talk to many people about Jerry Lewis and his films you often get extreme reactions. Some think he's a geniusone of the greatest film comics of all time. This is apparently true in much of the world outside the United States. Others think his films are terrible and would never watch them. Well me being a compulsive nut about films in the last couple years I have sought out his films and have seen most of them a few such as The Day the Clown Cried are not available. And overall I have come to feel that you cannot call his films good or badsome are exceptional and some are terrible. This is true of most filmmakers and comics. So when I say bad things about Cinderfella understand I am NOT antiLewisI just think this film in particular is very very weak. Why? Well three main reasons sink this filmwhich I'll talk about below.Cinderfella is a reworking of the traditional Cinderella story with a few big changes. Instead of women it's a guy's storywith wicked stepbrothers a male protagonist and a fairy godFATHER. Another is that it's set in the present dayso you'll see cars mansions in Beverly Hills and the like.The film finds Jerry playing a person named 'Fella' ??. He lives with his nasty stepmother and stepbrothers in a fancy mansion. Apparently somewhere on the property some fortune is hiddenbut no one knows where it is. In an odd actually BIZARRE twist Fella's dead father talks to him in dreams and tries to tell him where the money is hidden. This part of the story to me wasn't entirely necessary. Anyway the rest is a lot like the original storywith a Ball Fella working like a slave in his home and the rest.So why was I less than thrilled with the film? The biggest problem was the singing. While Lewis' singing isn't bad and occasionally pretty good in some films here it is rather poorand he does it many many times. One song might have worked but for a nonsinger four is too many and each time he sang the film ground to a halt. Second and it is also a biggie is that the film just wasn't funny. Too few of the jokes worked and frankly there just weren't that many attempts at laughs. In contrast in The Bellboy which I really liked the jokes came so rapidly that even if they didn't work each time you kept laughing. Here there were fewer attempts and too many serious moments. Finally in too many scenes the director not Lewis in this case overdid the scenes. For example Jerry doesn't just comb his hair like a normal guy he had to comb it 'wacky'and took too long combing his hair! And as Fella did his household chores each time it was so overdone and overlong that it strained my nerves. Overall a clear misfire and among Lewis' weakest films. Not terriblejust not all that good.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a reason why cinderfella is a masterpiece. That's right! A masterpiece. Cinderfella has more or less the same as the actionadventurecomedy toon movie Shrek. But Shrek never probed the human condition or attacked and satirized the political and economic stratum the way Cinderfella does. It is an attack on those ever after children's tales that driven the prince charmingcinderella complex among women. With the popularity of such poor romantic comedies as Julia Roberts Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Lopez vehicles succeeding and the equally popular tv shows the bachelorette and Joe millionaire it's nice to know Jerry was ahead of the game as he always was. By making Cinderella  Cinderfella  Jerry attacks man's and societies need for perfection a perfection that is a dream only.

A simple and common statement but one worth repeated over as it is often forgotten unheeded and trivialized. And the final five minutes is just the most touching final moments of any romantic comedy as it becomes clear that life isn't for the Prince charmings or the princesses but the regular joe and he doesn't have to say he has 50000000 to live or enjoy it. You know the more I think of this movie the better it gets. Thank you Fella!".

But Shrek never probed the human condition or attacked and satirized the political and economic stratum the way Cinderfella does. It is an attack on those ever after children's tales that driven the prince charmingcinderella complex among women. With the popularity of such poor romantic comedies as Julia Roberts Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Lopez vehicles succeeding and the equally popular tv shows the bachelorette and Joe millionaire it's nice to know Jerry was ahead of the game as he always was. By making Cinderella  Cinderfella  Jerry attacks man's and societies need for perfection a perfection that is a dream only.

Of course the wife becomes the Wicked Stepmother Judith Anderson who has two equally wicked sons Maximilian Henry Silva and Rupert Robert Hutton.

But at the stroke of midnight.................................................................Lewis tries to play the pathos card throughout the film and you do feel sorry for him at times. He has plenty of time for his usual tomfoolery and a couple of forgettable songs. Lewis shows why Dean Martin did most of the singing during their partnership. His entrance at the ball foreshadows a similar scene in The Nutty Professor a couple of years down the road.Judith Anderson makes a perfect Wicked Stepmother. She played many sinister characters over the course of her distinguished career. Henry Silva looks like a gangster and Robert Hutton is the fun loving playboy. The legendary Ed Wynn is a perfect Fairy Godfather although I still can't figure out why they gave him a red nose. Alberghetti is beautiful here but I still can't figure out why she didn't do better in movies.The sequence where the boys take Fella out to play polo and golf among other things falls flat because you don't actually see Fella play any of the sports. This could have provided many much needed humorous situations at this point.The ending is kind of corny.".

I don't know why JL choose this film for a vehicle for himself it would have been better to have two bothers completing with each other and to play off each other. the love interest never really works well either.

The English Language version is rather clumsily synchronized although the voices used for the dubbing are fine. The on location filming is lovely. But what really makes it memorable is the new musical score composed by Anne and Milton Delugg. Not only are the songs charming but the orchestrations are wonderful. This is basically the Grimm Brothers version of Cinderella but the Fairy Godmother from Perrault's tale has been added. Goodtimes Home Video released a near mint videotape of it years ago but it is now out of print and it was never easy to find even when it was available. The only other release was a cassette from Republic home videoalso out of print which was missing 22 minutes and was scratchy and splicey to boot. Ihope this film makes it to DVD soon!".

There are plenty of gags funny lines and good ideas you could fill a whole web page with the hilarious things that Billie Burke gets to say.But after the popular surpriseparty sequence everything slows down the movie could actually end at this point. There is no dramatic need for anything else to happen up until this point Lew Ayres has never shown any desire to get Greer back. It's not even clear to me why he bothers to slips them the drug other than to help them forget their misery.After eighty minutes the movie ends very abruptly with Greer speaking a line that makes absolutely no sense.

Do you like horses? and of course the implication is that she was serving horse for breakfast..but they were going to have a fox hunt AFTER breakfast. Lot of fun bits but you kind of have to buy into the memory loss deal. G. Garson reminds me of Myrna Loy... strongwilled plain talking speaks her mind. I liked Lew Ayres better in HOLIDAY... keep an eye out for Henry Travers as the Judge an old friend of the family he was Clarence the friendly ghost in Its a Wonderful Life. Some of the gags fall flat like the color of my eyes since its in black and white. For the most part its a fun all around lovestory farce. Directed by Norman McLeod who had directed the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields so he certainly knew how to make a comedy! this has pretty low ratings but its a cute little love story. ksf2".

Robert Taylor Greer Garson and Lew Ayres star in what surely is the foreshadowing of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind except that this is one case where a later film is better than one from the classic era.The film concerns a man Jeff Holland Taylor who falls in love with his friend Sky's Lew Ayres fianc Linda Garson and abruptly marries her. However he's a workaholic. This makes her very unhappy and the two divorce. Desirous of getting them back together Sky uses an experimental drug that sounded like mematine. It erases everything that happened in the last six months. Interesting because today there is a drug called memantine for Alzheimer's so it actually has an opposite effect.Remember? is only mildly funny. It lacks the pace of a comedy  it's one of those in between things where the story isn't compelling enough to be a drama but doesn't come off like a comedy either. The main part of the plot comes practically at the end of the film. One scene I did love  Billie Burke as Garson's mother has a surprise congratulatory party for the new couple. When they arrive she has everybody hide behind furniture  which has become somewhat tedious because the Hollands are late and the entire group has been hiding on and off for hours. When they arrive Jeff and Linda are sent into the library where Jeff complains to Linda about her father and her family's boring blowhard friends. Then Billie Burke yells surprise. A very good scene but there weren't enough of these in the movie to justify it.The performances are good. Taylor is unbelievably handsome and really did have a nice flair for comedy. Lew Ayres in real life a pacifist vegetarian and a very spiritual man somehow played drinking men very well and does so in this. Garson was still very early in her career but had already received an Oscar nomination. Guess Mayer thought she was a flash in the pan  this is hardly a step in a prestige career. Garson probably hoped she never was nominated for an Oscar again  who knows what MGM would do to her next. Fortunately it didn't work out that way.Remember? is one of those films you'll more than likely want to forget.".

Most of the films about that are serious ones with people trying their best to recover lost memories. In fact Greer Garson in a few years would costar in one of the best of those movies Random Harvest.Remember? was the second film on Garson's contract and a followup to her acclaimed performance in Goodbye Mr. Chips for which she got her first Academy Award nomination. She's teamed here with Robert Taylor and the plot premise starts out like a lighter version of Boom Town.If you'll remember after meeting Clark Gable Claudette Colbert marries him on the spot to the chagrin of Spencer Tracy who is Gable's best friend. I'd say they stole the idea but Boom Town came out the following year.Maybe Louis B. Mayer decided that it was a gambit that needed a serious interpretation after this movie. Lew Ayres comes into his office brimming with news of an impending marriage to Greer Garson for his best friend Robert Taylor. They go out to lunch and Taylor gets Garson alone and that's it for Ayres. But Taylor the young hard driving executive just can't tear himself away from business to actually run away with Garson. When they finally do his mind is still on business and they eventually get divorced.Meanwhile scientist Sig Ruman is inventing his amnesia drug and sly Lew Ayres mixes it for both of them. They do forget each other but love does find a way. Ruman's character might have been the basis for Jack Kruschen's scientist in Lover Come Back a film also about advertising and a crazy product. In fact now that I think of it Ayres has the Tony Randall part.In which I've seen some descriptions of his performance as fey. This was the problem when back in the days of The Code you had to tap dance around having a gay character in the film. If someone bothers to remake Remember? Ayres's character will be openly gay.But I doubt that's going to happen. The film just doesn't get off the ground and is waste of the talent involved. In the Citadel Film series book The Films Of Robert Taylor it's recorded that Taylor thought very little of this film. It was the third of three duds with the public Lucky Night Lady Of The Tropics and this one. His career hit a dry patch in 1939. As for Garson she recovered quickly enough and had so many suitable roles for her coming up. I'm sure she'd have liked to forget this one as well.".

In fact now that I think of it Ayres has the Tony Randall part.In which I've seen some descriptions of his performance as fey. This was the problem when back in the days of The Code you had to tap dance around having a gay character in the film. If someone bothers to remake Remember? Ayres's character will be openly gay.But I doubt that's going to happen. The film just doesn't get off the ground and is waste of the talent involved. In the Citadel Film series book The Films Of Robert Taylor it's recorded that Taylor thought very little of this film. It was the third of three duds with the public Lucky Night Lady Of The Tropics and this one. His career hit a dry patch in 1939. As for Garson she recovered quickly enough and had so many suitable roles for her coming up. I'm sure she'd have liked to forget this one as well.";

Robert Taylor is good as the eventual husband. Greer Garson already seems like a polished actress in only her second film. We have a lot of sympathy for the original fiance  Lew Ayres  who is really pleasant. I never understood the attraction of Billie Burke...and still don't. Reginald Owen doesn't get much beyond his usual bluster. Henry Travers is always a welcome addition to any film.

	schema:headline " Very Authentic Fur Trader Adventure Not FastPaced But Engrossing";
	schema:reviewBody "This feature is an exercise in pure filmic storytelling for Howard Hawks and the talented veteran director appears to enjoys this unusual freedom from having to worry about indoor sets intricate lighting setups and costume designs although Dorthy Jeakins' costumes are wonderful. Here he gets to realize the best elements of A.B. Guthrie's tough novel of the early West The Big Sky. Bringing to life the major characters of this exciting adventure are Kirk Douglas as happygolucky Jim Deakins Dewey Martin adequate as Boone Caudill Arthur Hunnicut in awardwinning form as Uncle Zeb Jim Davis as Streak Steven Geray lovable as Frenchie owner of the riverboat the Mandan Hank Worden as Poor Devil and Elizabeth Threatt as Teal Eye the Amerind girl Geray is returning so they can open fur trade with the proud and wary Blackfleet chiefs. The film tends to be a bit leisurely in its development but the action sequences are unusually exciting and the characters are very believable at every moment. The cinematography by Russell Harlan and the music by Dimitri Tiomkin are very fine indeed. What propels the first portion of the film narrated Hunnicutt is developing friendship between Jim Deakins and enigmatic runaway youth Boone then they find Uncle Zeb in a St. Louis jail and are freed to join a dangerous veryearly voyage up the Missouri River. The battle between their group and deadly agents of The Company led by Davis are the major elements in the remainder of this oftenrough humorous and very moving story. It would be hard to credit Hawks enough for all the good things that happen in this film he even finds a way to enliven the story by playing up the differences between Martin and Threatt one of h signature malefemale disagreements. Douglas and the other two form an interesting love triangle and the climax that requires Martin to decide whether he is going to turn down what Douglas would give anything he has to obtain is very satisfying to my way of thinking. This a film that is atmospheric always interesting and a firstrate look at the old West as it was before it was changed forever. The characters' comments on the anthill aspects of overcrowded St. Louis the jumpingoffplace to the west population 12000 tell us that we are in a different simpler and cleaner era of civilization. This is one of the best films about the era of the fur trappers and their ways and trade ever produced in every way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everything in The big sky has the brand of greatness story direction acting script photography locations. Yet there's something more. Along the film director Howard Hawks keeps  touching profound strings of our souls. Indeed we grownup viewers are more or less consciously brought back to the dreams of our prime which is always a source of sweet though melancholic bliss. Every young boy has dreamed a totally free life like that of the guys on the screen. Action and adventure merged into a wild glorious almost impossibly beautiful nature. Having fun with our mates and when necessary fighting against the bad ones. Contacting the cultures of faraway fascinating populations. And as the main benefit loving a gorgeous Indian girl.Follows an incomplete exposition of the other merits of The big sky. The film is brilliantly made and interpreted. The actors are all outstanding. Arthur Hunnicutt dominates. Kirk Douglas' natural dynamic way is perfect for his role. Dewey Martin is excellent as well. Special mentions to Elizabeth Threatt as Teal Eye and to Hank Worden as the funny but smart Poordevil. The black and white photography is magnificent. Indeed only black and white seems capable to render the incredible bright of Threatt's eyes. And it fully respects and gives depth to the beauty of nature. As usual in Howard Hawks' works the movie is based on swiftpaceaction amalgamated with the human interaction of the characters. Here we have a world with no established laws out of those of nature. People survive if they recognize who is a friend and who is an enemy independently on being white or native. The mixture of languages English French Native and related often funny translations is a fine device to give realism to the script. The love story develops at the rhythm of nature similarly to the endless journey of the keelboat and it's even touching at the ending. We also see that irrational hate is not just criminal nonsense it's even ridiculous. It seems that The big sky was considerably cut by the studios. In fact some magnificent choral scenes appears to be too short. One instance for all the paramount scene of the Blackfeet hauling the keelboat on the river lasts just few seconds. To cut the film was certainly a very bad idea. Fortunately The big sky remains a masterpiece worth of Hawks' immense talent and genius.   Well it's enough clear that I like this movie. Indeed I strongly believe that Howard Hawks was born to give us joy. The big sky is a major evidence in favor of my opinion.".

First is the multilayered plot.  Besides the story of an enterprise The Big Sky is about how men in a time long past interacted when their differences were subordinated to a higher purpose. Second is director Howard Hawks whose trademark naturalistic dialogue technique is put to wonderful use here.  Hawks works on complex relationships  male and female Frenchie and Anglo backwoodsmen Native Americans and whites  like a conductor a symphony.  Third and perhaps most touching is the tale of male bonding not only among the group of men but oneonone between Jim Deakins played by Kirk Douglas and Boone his young sidekick played by Hawks proteg Dewey Martin.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is EXCELLENT and is filled with many vivid scenes of the Jackson Hole Valley country. Being shot along the Snake River and within easy sight of the Teton Mountain range it gives an amazingly accurate account of what early Keel Boat travel might have been like along the Missouri River and other Western tributaries. Kirk Douglas Jim Deakins is superb as he portrays one of three game hunters along with Dewey Martin Boone and the comic backwoods relief of Arthur Hunicutt Uncle Zeb. Mr. Hunicutt steals the show with his Southern drawl and folksy way cultivating a feeling for the viewer as being one of the crew. The use of actual French actors  accents adds to the believable setting of the early 1800s environ and customs of the trappers and mountain men who blazed the trails into the West and survived through trade and cooperation with the Indian tribes who populated it. From using trees along the bank to catapult game down to the Keel boat to the unforgettable scene where medical aid is rendered to Kirk.Well worth your time and any children should be shown it as well because they'll remember it throughout their lives.

	onyx:emotionText "This film is EXCELLENT and is filled with many vivid scenes of the Jackson Hole Valley country. Being shot along the Snake River and within easy sight of the Teton Mountain range it gives an amazingly accurate account of what early Keel Boat travel might have been like along the Missouri River and other Western tributaries. Kirk Douglas Jim Deakins is superb as he portrays one of three game hunters along with Dewey Martin Boone and the comic backwoods relief of Arthur Hunicutt Uncle Zeb. Mr. Hunicutt steals the show with his Southern drawl and folksy way cultivating a feeling for the viewer as being one of the crew. The use of actual French actors  accents adds to the believable setting of the early 1800s environ and customs of the trappers and mountain men who blazed the trails into the West and survived through trade and cooperation with the Indian tribes who populated it. From using trees along the bank to catapult game down to the Keel boat to the unforgettable scene where medical aid is rendered to Kirk.Well worth your time and any children should be shown it as well because they'll remember it throughout their lives. I certainly have!";

	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite Kirk Douglas films is The Big Sky where he plays mountain mantrapper Jim Deakins. It's a great part for Douglas with his incredible charm and quick burn when someone does him wrong.The Big Sky was RKO Pictures big production for 1952. I'd like to say that Howard Hughes spared no expense in making this film shooting a good deal of it in the Grand Tetons the actual location for the adventures of many fur trappers. But for the life of me I don't understand why Hughes and RKO after doing that didn't spring for color.Possibly because director Howard Hawks wanted black and white. His last epic film Red River had done well in black and white. Still I really think something was missed. RKO did use color on films with a lot less budget.There's a lot of similarity between The Big Sky and Red River. Both films involve a group of men on an epic journey into the unknown for business reasons. In Red River John Wayne has to get that huge herd to market and has to use a trail few have used. In The Big Sky a group of independent trappers basically want to land a nice fur contract with the Blackfeet Indians where few whites have gone up the Missouri River. Going against them is a fur trading consortium kind of like the one John Jacob Astor put together.The trappers are mostly French Canadian Metis headed by Steven Geray but also along is Arthur Hunnicutt who speaks the Indian language. Their ace in the hole is Elizabeth Threatt a Blackfoot princess the trappers have rescued and are bringing back to her people in the hopes that her old man will be grateful. Hunnicutt is also the narrator of the film.Douglas and Dewey Martin join up with the group in St. Louis and the trappers have the usual adventures as they take the flatboat up into the Missouri River country. The scenes showing journey upriver are nicely photographed.Two others in the cast merit attention. Hank Worden does a nice job as a lost Blackfoot Indian who the trappers pick up. He may not be playing with a full deck but he does come in handy. Jim Davis is one lean and mean villain as the company troubleshooter who wants to keep the independents out.Arthur Hunnicutt got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role The Big Sky proved to be his career film. Unfortunately he lost to Anthony Quinn for Viva Zapata. Still Hunnicutt's folksy charm was always something to look forward to in any film he was ever in.The Big Sky is one of the best films ever done about the mountain man era of the American frontier. If they'd only spent for color.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Big Sky is directed by Howard Hawks and adapted by Dudley Nichols from the novel of the same name written by A.B. Guthrie Jr. It stars Kirk Douglas Dewey Martin Elizabeth Threatt  Arthur Hunnicutt. Dimitri Tiomkin scores the music and Russell Harlan photographs on location at Grand Teton National Park  Jackson Hole in Wyoming.1832 and Jim Deakins Douglas  Boone Caudill Martin meet by chance out in the wilderness. Quickly bonding they travel to St Louis together to seek out Boone's Uncle Zeb Hunnicutt. After finding him via a bar room brawl the two men agree to join Zeb in a venture up the Missouri river to trade fur with the unpredictable Blackfoot Indians their insurance against attack by the Blackfoot coming courtesy of Teal Eye Threatt a beautiful Blackfoot princess kidnapped years previously and now being returned home. Along the way the party have to battle nature the Indian factions and also the Missouri Company out to topple their enterprise for fear of losing their monopoly on trade. Perhaps worse still is that the new found friendship between Boone  Jim will be tested by their mutual attraction to Teal Eye?Given the credentials that come with The Big Sky it's a little surprising that it's not more well known. Hawks Douglas and Tiomkin speak for themselves while Guthrie wrote the script for Shane and Nichols wrote the screenplay for John Ford's 1939 pulse raiser Stagecoach. Add in that Hunnicutt and Harlan were Academy Award nominated for Best Support Actor and Cinematography respectively well you have a fine bunch of professionals involved with this movie. So why so ignored or forgotten? The starting point should be with Hawks himself who openly had issues with the finished product. Originally the film was a huge 140 minutes long and was doing decent business at the box office. But the studio execs had it cut down to 122 minutes so as to fit one more screening in during the day. The film promptly flopped and was left for dead by director and studio. Hawks was also never fully behind Douglas in the role of Deakins he had wanted Gary Cooper or John Wayne. It seems in the end that Hawks just walked away after release and lost faith in promoting it. Western fans were grateful that the experience didn't make him turn his back on the genre tho for he delivered Rio Bravo 7 years later.Having not seen the full uncut version of the film I personally have to say that the 122 minute version viewed was pretty uneven and lacking a certain narrative spark to make it fully work. It's even episodic for the most part. What isn't in doubt is that visually it's one of Hawks' most rewarding pictures with Harlan's photography sumptuous and period perfecto. Douglas is spirited and plays the black humour within quite nicely while Martin is good foil for Douglas' beaming machismo even if he's just a little too animated at times. Threatt doesn't have to do anything other than smile and look pretty while Hank Worden shows up to neatly play a buffoon Indian called Poordevil! Undoubtedly the star of the show is Hunnicutt who also narrates tucking into a boozy grizzled teller of tall tales character Hunnicutt lifts the film on the frequent occasions it threatens to sag beyond repair.With the visuals and enjoyable Hawksian take on man love the film is worth the time of any Western fan. While the efforts to resist racism are honourable and neatly played. But in the end Hawks' frustration is justified for it feels like a patched together adventure piece. And certainly not one that makes you think it's directed by the man who made Red River. I wouldn't hesitate to watch the full 140 minute cut of the film but until then it will be some time before I can see myself watching this version again. 610Footnote Some Region 2 DVD's exist of the full cut where the cut scenes have been spliced back in from a 16mm print. I'm led to believe that the quality is far from great. For British readers the 122 minute cut shows up once in a blue moon on TV where the BBC have the rights so at least it is advertisement free. As yet there is still no Region 1 release for the film.".

Perhaps Hawks was so successful with Red River that he did not want to change to color. As the scenery of the river and vegetation around it are so rich contrary to the desert of Red River some scenes get confusing specially when it is dark. Hawks uses Dmitri Tiomkin again for the great music.";

	schema:reviewBody "If ever a sprawling tale about an expedition up the Missouri river to trade furs begged for Technicolor photography THE BIG SKY is it. Based on the novel by A.B. Guthrie it has KIRK DOUGLAS in the lead as the head of the expedition but most of the footage belongs to young DEWEY MARTIN in his first big screen role. Why he never managed to become a more important player in Hollywood remains a mystery to me.Unfortunately Dudley Nichols' screenplay is rather episodic and there are many points toward the end of the film where it seems the story is about to end and then there are further scenes. I found none of the narration objectionable as others here seem to imply but the structure of the screenplay is awkwardly handled especially toward the latter part of the film.Another minus point the night scenes in the woods look as though they were photographed in a studio and not on location which minimizes the sense of danger from Indians and other trappers that the story requires. But most of the exterior daylight scenes are photographed in crisp BW photography in real outdoor settings which tend to jar against the studiolit scenes making them more noticeable.There's plenty of male camaraderie and friendship among the trappers and colorful incidents involving the Indians so if this kind of western is your thing you'll undoubtedly find it interesting. I watched the 140 minute version on TCM and it was slow going at times.Summing up Biggest drawback should definitely have been filmed in breathtaking Technicolor.".

And in this case the west isn't really all that far west. It's set around 1830 in the Missouri River regionwhat's now known as the American Midwest.The story begins in Kentucky. Two adventurers Kirk Douglas and Dewey Martin meet in an EXTREMELY unbelievable and contrived manner. They don't even know each other and start punchin' each other. In fact although it's a good film this is a big weakness in the moviethey seem to have too many fistfights and this is a rather limp way to inject comedy into the movie. However as a result of one of these scraps the two find Martin's uncle Arthur Hunnicutt and the uncle convinces them to join him in a rather dangerous journey into Blackfoot territory in order to trade for furs. Two problems stand in their waythe local trading company that wants a monopoly on furs and hostile tribes such as the Sioux who were in real life a fierce and rather warlike tribe. What's next? See the film.In many ways this film reminds me of a slightly better film Clark Gable's Across the Wide Missouri. I say slightly better because the film's vivid color really made it much more attractive than the black  white in The Big Sky. Additionally the Gable film was much less lighthearted and seemed a lot more realistic. However both are still well worth seeingparticularly because they give a much more realistic view of the West than you find in about 90 of Hollywood's films. Well worth seeing.By the way Hunnicutt received a Best Supporting Actor nomination and it was well deserved. He was to me the best actor in the film and had a nice opportunity to show more than his usual roles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most westerns I've seen were set in the years after the US civil war but this one is set several decades earlier when much of the west was part of the United States in name only with vast areas that had rarely if ever been visited by white men. One such area was the upper reaches of the Missouri river a land inhabited by the Blackfoot Indians. This film tells the story of a group of independent fur traders who intend to travel to this area because of the potential for profit and because most of the closer territories are controlled by 'The Company'. The protagonists are Jim Deakins and Boone Caudill two men who became friends on the way to St Louis and signed up for the job there along with Boone's uncle Zeb who they met in jail. Normally such a job would be impossible as they would not be welcome in Blackfoot territory but the boat's captain has an Indian woman named Teal Eye on board the daughter of a chief who had had been captured by another tribe. One the way up river they have many things to contend with including Company men Crow Indians nature and Teal Eye who wants to kill Boone because he has the scalp of the Blackfoot warrior he believes killed his brother.I was a little surprised when the film started to see it was in black and white and 'narrow screen' I'd imagined with a title like 'The Big Sky' it would be in Technicolor and widescreen to show of those big skies to maximum effect. Given its age I shouldn't have been too surprised though and the film still looked good in fact the black and white was an advantage for the many night scenes where colour often looks slightly unnatural. The actors did a fine job although looking at it with a modern eye it is a pity that the Indian characters weren't played by Native Americans. That said the politics seemed admirably liberal for a film of this time the Indians weren't portrayed as savages and most of the furriers respected them and Boone's dislike was based on his brother's death and even that changes over time. Even the hostile Crow are only hostile because the Company has stirred them up. As well as their various adventures there is the inevitable romantic subplot Deakin's clearly has feelings for Teal Eye but by the end she sees him as a brother and fancies Boone something that will test their friendship. If you like westerns don't be put off by the lack of colour watch it and enjoy a fine story well acted.".

	schema:reviewBody "Red River and The Big Sky are like bookends both in history and in the careers of the people who made them many of which were the same people. They are arguably the greatest westerns of the postCivil War era and the preCivil War era respectively. Both were directed by the great Howard Hawks based on novels by the noted writers Borden Chase and AB Guthrie. Both are river movies although the river in Red River is not the river of the title but rather the River of Red the working title represented by the longhorn beeves the heroes are taking to market. There is something inherently cinematic about movies that involve a journey down a river. They always seem metaphors for the journey of life.Both films have significant introductory stories. Red River doesn't begin with the trail drive. It begins with the story of Tom Dunson his first love lost in a wagon train raid and his creation of one of the largest ranches in Texas. He also meets up with Matthew Garth who will become his surrogate son. This is important because it reveals much about his character. In the Big Sky we first meet Jim Deakins in Kentucky where he meets his new friend Boone Caudill these characters were originally to have been played by Wayne and Clift in a repairing from their Red River success. Then we get a humorous look at St. Louis in the 1830's before the story really begins with the expedition down the Missouri.Both films have complex male characters. Dunston is a driven man but a sensitive one who was madly in love with the woman he lost and sees something of her in Joanne Dru's character an important element because it softens him a bit for the confrontation at the end. Garth is a cocky young guy but one with internal strength. Will it be enough? Jim Deakins is a tough but very agreeable character a contrast to the sort of hard driven guy Kirk Douglas was known for playing and being. Dewey Martin's Caudill is defined by his hatred of Indians. He's humanized by Deakin's friendship and his love for Teal Eye.Both films examine the subject of male love not in the Brokeback Mountain sense but in the sense that Michael Landon talked about when he was interviewed about Bonanza When you get right down to it the strongest attachments are between menfathers brothers. And the strongest fights are between the people who are most attached.Both films feature strong women too. Colleen Gray in her one scene in Red River proves herself to be not just a sweet young thing but the kind of strong woman a Tom Dunson would want standing next to him not behind him through life. And Joanne Dru echoes her in one of the best female roles in the western genre a woman strong enough to love two men and bring them together. And Teal Eye is a resourceful gal who knows what she wants and overcomes Boone's irrational hatred of her kind to bring out the love in him. These ladies are what the term a good woman was meant to describe.As to the ending of Red River did you really want to see Tom or Matt die? Did you want to see one responsible for the death of the other? My only complaint with this is that the conversion should have taken longer than it did perhaps after a Spoilers type fight and a night of nursing wounds. But these guys and these gals belong together in the journey down the river of life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Huston does very good work here using a fine script in presenting the story of Freud not as a standard biography but concentrating only on his initial work in examining the effect of the subconscious mind on conscious though perhaps involuntary actions  an idea believed preposterous at the time. The narrative is presented essentially as a psychological detective story as Freud tries to discover the root causes of one patient's multiple afflictions and aberrant behavior none of which has any physical cause. The film uses depictions of memories dreams thoughts as visual clues  all progressively revealing more  to lead us and Freud steadily closer to the underlying truth in the case as well as in other areas disturbing him. The opening and closing narration by Huston is effective though the occasional narration he does as the story progresses bothered me a little it was as if they felt there was something missing from the film which had to be explained in voiceover and it also pulled me out of the story momentarily. Probably it would have been more effective if Clift rather than Huston had done the narration from Freud's point of view in the body of the film. The film which maintains a serious fiercely somber atmosphere throughout similar to The Elephant Man though perhaps more so here does not proceed with any real speed  you'll need to stay with it and the dark harsh style of photography and music while effective might be difficult for some viewers. You need not agree with Freud's concluding theories many of which are not held in particularly high regard today in order to recognize the importance and validity of his primary methods and pioneering work in what was then a highly ridiculed field. 8 of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "It's always interesting to see how the art of cinema... a form of expression which much too often suffers under an audience and financial backers who demand simple entertainment easily taken in and processed... deals with topics that are more complex and intricate than can be explained to the common moviegoer in a limited space of time that being between an hour and a half and about three hoursin recent years there has been a return of the longer running times... for better or for worse and with ranging success. Psychoanalysis was also dealt with by the master of suspense himself Alfred Hitchcock... in Spellbound in 1945. He as Huston does here gave it a fair treatment though oversimplifying it some. What's interesting is that Huston while his film seems to be the lesser known is actually the better representation of the subjectthough mind you not necessarily the better film. This deals with Freud and his discoveries following him for half a decade giving what may be a fairly accurate account of his first work with hypnosis and psychoanalysis. We see a few of his patients and the film focuses on him as he works on one particular patient... whose symptoms strongly resemble some he to a considerably lesser degree has himself and we experience how he develops and presentsand is met with strong protest and outrage as he indeed was in real life one theory which would become a cornerstone of his psychological writings and his view on man. I will not reveal what it is here but anyone should know what he believed before watching this since it is a rather provocative ideaand it is somewhat glorified in this film... Freud comes across as more of a misunderstood genius than the hopeful manwho did yield some important and interesting discoveries that he was in real life. The cinematic values of the film are fine... the pace could have been more consistentit should be noted that I watched a cut that was 120 minutes not 139 long and there are one or two scenes which seem obsolete but there's little else that stands out neither positively nor negatively. The film's score is dramatic but that is not uncommon for a movie of that period. There are several nice touches in the film in regards to who it is about... among them the Freudian slip in a scene with a patient. I recommend this to anyone interested in psychology regardless of their view on Freud... it's interesting to watch and fairly nicely done to boot. Just keep in mind that it's neither a documentary nor a proper biographical film. 710".

The story took hold and has been repeated countless times by Clift biographers down to this day despite the lack of any corroborating witnesses plus no other actors ever came forward to say that Huston was so cruel to them on other shoots.For the most part John Huston didn't care what people said about him but this story actually did damage to his reputation. It is the only negative story about Huston that he felt the need to respond to. In his 1979 memoirs AN OPEN BOOK Huston gives a detailed account of the shooting of FREUD and addresses the specific allegations against him. We may never know the whole truth but Huston does quite a credible job of defending himself. Naturally his side of the story never got as much attention as the original charges. You should find the book and read it.More trivia After JeanPaul Sartre's death his admirers published much of his original unused screen treatment and predictably condemned John Huston for not filming Sartre's eighthour screenplay as if anyone would have tolerated an eighthour movie.Because of Sigmund Freud's theories FREUD was arguably the first motion picture to deal even briefly with the subject of incest. In real life Freud contended that many adolescents go through a phase where they have sexual feelings for their parents of the opposite sex and then go into denial that they ever felt such things after they get older. If Freud was correct the denial is very strong for he is reviled for this theory to this day. But readers can you HONESTLY say that as a young teen that you never once cast a glance at mom's legs or her cleavage?FREUD is a good biographical film and it is a shame that it has never been pleased on VHS or DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "According to the Citadel Film Series book about the films of John Huston he was interested for about 20 years in bringing Sigmund Freud's life and work to the big screen. When he finally got a script from philosopher JeanPaul Sartre it was an eight hour epic which he finally trimmed down to less than two and half hours. A manageable length and it only covers the years 1885 to 1891 when Freud developed his theories about infant sexuality and the Oedipal complex. Just the mere fact that when you mention psychology and ask who is the person most associated with the field and Freud is the answer 99 of the time qualifies him to be the first man of his field. Those theories which he expounds have been challenged down through the years but more often than not his peers are building on what he started and not just outrightly dismissing Freud.The subject is probably too complex a one to bring to the screen for the lay person but Huston makes a valiant effort. Huston also had Code parameters to deal with in 1962. Huston is also helped along by a great performance he coaxed out of Montgomery Clift and God knows Clift was a man by that time beset with his own demons of the mind and had seen enough of psychology as well as more addicting methods of pain control. Huston had the devil's own time with Clift but Clift responded greatly. It was a miracle this film was finished at all.This was Montgomery Clift's last really great film. He did a rather pedestrian spy novel The Defector four years later as his last film. That was like a tune up film for him to do before he was to start Reflections In A Golden Eye. Monty was way too gone by then and essentially just walked through that one. He should have gone out with Freud.There are a couple of other performances of note. Sussanah York as the girl who Clift treats that really gets him thinking along the lines of sex and David McCallum as well as a mental patient who shows some interesting subliminal sexual behavior under hypnosis. Larry Parks also makes an appearance as Freud's colleague friend but critic in the end Joseph Breuer.Essentially Freud is Clift's show all the way and a grand show it is. And this review is dedicated to my father Leonard S. Kogan who was most prominent in this field and had a bust of Freud along with Einstein and Washington among the bric a brac in our house as people he admired.".

On the plus it is educational to see how something mainstream presents material which should be avant guard. The dream sequences are interesting for that reason as the film would have been much better if they pushed the envelope. Instead the film maintains a balance in the imaginings of what an Oedipal Complex were of what dreams are like and I suppose the images are as developed as they could be for 1960's America. For that reason I recommend it The film is a bit of time capsule in how films were made.

	schema:reviewBody "Hypnosis hysteria moody BW photography beards and a haunted Montgomery Clift combine in a fascinating movie.I have seen this film a few times and each time I appreciate it a little more. It concentrates on the years in Sigmund Freud's life around 1890 when he made his groundbreaking studies on the nature of sexuality. Although I had the impression Freud was more of a solo act the film shows that after a falling out with the head of the Vienna Hospital Dr. Theodore Meynert Eric Portman friend and mentor Dr. Joseph Breuer Larry Parks played a big role in his discoveries.As Freud deals with one intriguing case after another he encounters Cecily Koertner played by a sexy Susannah York who has a disturbing father hangup and enough problems for a battalion of pioneering psychiatrists. This was relatively early in Susannah's career and she just about steals the show. Sadly she is gone now a bit young at 72.Montgomery Clift's performance has a quality of suffering that he didn't have to fake. Director John Huston pieced together Clift's performance because the actor's life was pretty well out of control by this stage. What a presence he still had though he was probably the only actor who ever remotely intimidated Brando. Insights come when Freud deals with the troubled Carl von Schlossen who has savagely attacked his father. Schlossen was played by David McCallum a few years before Man from Uncle fame. When Freud deduces the attack was over the younger Schlossen's jealousy of his mother Freud is shocked into the realisation that his own infantile feelings for his mother may well have gone beyond love of her strudel. Huston approached all this as a mystery thriller especially when the treatment of Cecily reveals to Freud that just about all repressed emotional disturbances are based on conflicted feelings toward mum and dad.Jerry Goldsmith's score helps drive the film it's as atonal as they come but it grows on you. Again like many of the stars it was early in the career of the great film maestro.The film mixes in dream sequences with plenty of symbolism reminiscent of the films of Ingmar Bergman. In fact the whole thing has a Bergmanesque quality. And talk about the id and the ego John Huston delivers Godlike narration at key points.Huston made many great films as well as a couple of duds however Freud was a bold idea it's challenging but beautifully made and deserves to be ranked among his best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Freud which was released in 1962 is not a film seen much these days. We recently caught up with it when it was shown on a classic movie channel. It is worth a look because of the content as well as for the man at the center of the story. John Huston directed and served as the narrator. The screenplay by Charles Kaufman tries to condense in 140 minutes some of the most memorable aspects of the famous man.The film begins and ends with a sequence where Copernicus as well as Charles Darwin are mentioned as people with visions that changed our knowledge of the world in which we live. The young Dr. Freud's early career is examined. His early career in Vienna was dominated by the tyrannical Dr. Meynert who made Freud's life a living hell although as the old man was dying he called the younger man in what could be seen an offering of peace as the dying physician saw what Freud was doing.Freud had to go to Paris to learn the experiments Dr. Charcot an innovator was working with. Upon his return he is befriended by the kind Dr. Joseph Breuer who worked in close association with Freud. In fact it is because of his mentor Dr. Freud becomes involved in the case that would be his breakthrough treating Cecily Koertner a young woman suffering from paralyzing hysteria.Montgomery Clift who makes Freud a darker figure was an actor who was battling his own demons. The production suffered long delays because of his bouts of alcoholism. The actor was further tormented by his condition as a gay man something he worked hard to suppress. His performance although uneven gives the viewer a glimpse of what he was able to do. Susannah York makes a wonderful Cecily in one of her best screen appearances. Larry Parks an actor who suffered the indignities of being blacklisted does wonders with his Dr. Breuer. The supporting players included David McCallum Susan Kohner Eileen Herlie and Fernand Ledoux among the large last.".

He's wellmatched with a great supporting cast including Larry Parks as his mentor Susannah York as a particularly troubled patient and Susan Kohner as his patient if not always understanding wife. Director Huston and scriptwriters Charles Kaufman  Wolfgang Reinhardt retooling work done by Jean Paul Sartre make no judgments on Freud's theories instead leaving this very openended. The interesting supporting cast also includes David McCallum Eric Portman as one of Freud's more disagreeable seniors and Fernand Ledoux as French doctor JeanMartin Charcot who helped pioneer some of they hypnosis theories Freud would later become so famous for.

	schema:reviewBody "The original script was written by the existential philosopher JeanPaul Sartre. It has been significantly changed by other writers before the movie was shot. But we can be sure that it was hardly altered in those respects upon which I shall focus. It is usually assumed that philosophers have undergone a specific training in logical and clear thinking. Hence Sartre's participation should guarantee that the movie was free from elementary and flagrant errors whether of a logical or empirical nature. Unfortunately when their private and favourite ideas are concerned many philosophers are prepared to throw all logic and clarity overboard. Numerous thoroughly analysed examples can be found inter alia in my own academic writings. It is an incidental fact that I have not yet discussed Sartre in print. He is no exception. For some reason he was emotionally attracted by psychoanalysis. Therefore he opened his mind for all conventional propaganda and came to perceive Freud in the same mendacious way in which Freud always tried to present himself viz. as the lonely and uncompromising searcher for truth who despite prejudiced resistance from his colleagues made revolutionary and highly unexpected discoveries.Some of the lies of this movie can be unmasked by any laymen. Others may need advanced research. I shall start with the latter. Today no genuine scientist denies that no trace of interesting observations can be found in the writings by Freud or his followers. Much more prominent is their capacity for giving treatment to a patient during as much as 15 years without detecting conspicuous circumstances which are crucial to therapeutic success and which a competent clinician could have found out in 15 minutes. This is not a rhetoric exclamation of mine. Cases of this variety have been thoroughly documented. Nor is any part of the theory supported by any observations. And despite extensive labour no one has found a single patient who had been cured or improved by Freud or by any of his followers. It is a pattern of lies that neurotic symptoms are caused by repression' involving complete amnesia of childhood experiences that psychoanalysts have invented a specific method for lifting repression and that patients undergoing psychoanalytic treatment will suddenly recollect childhood experiences which it is absolutely impossible to get access to by any other method.  Michael Yapko has established that 28  of those licensed psychologists in the U.S. who attend conferences believe that recollections from the patient's earlier reincarnations can be obtained by means of hypnosis. This fact tells little about patients hypnosis or reincarnation. Instead it tells much about many people who are attracted by the psychological profession.Let us try out the possibility that every result of modern research about Freud and psychoanalysis is faulty. Can other lies be found in the movie which will be manifest to any layman? Definitely. In the beginning of his career Freud applied hypnosis in order to unearth experiences which supposedly had caused the symptoms and the disease. This is not a category of misinformation that a layman could expose. But note the subsequent step Freud abandoned hypnosis and proceeded with nonhypnotic treatment. The movie depicts how patients nevertheless recall the same kind of hitherto repressed events. However what is the nature of Freud's nonhypnotic treatment? If we may believe the film it is nothing else than ordinary conversation. Almost all people have often participated in such colloquies. Of course if I talk with a friend about my school days I may recall many events I may not have thought of for 40 years and may gradually recall things I did not recall immediately. But Freud makes it absolutely clear that lifted repression is altogether different from this pattern. He asserts that the variety of recollections he helped forth could never have emerged during ordinary colloquies.    If Sartre had applied his capacity for critical thinking he would have felt that Freud's account COULD NOT be true. And any layman who devoted a few seconds to reflect on the logic of the movie would have arrived at the same conclusion. In other words if the movie mirrors the true state of things the recollections and symptom removals were a kind of supernatural miracles.".

Over time however as the young artist's girlfriend poses for the older artist so that he can finish the painting it becomes apparent quite how emotionally demanding the artistic process is.Many people seem to find this film boring or pretentious. It's a matter of taste I guess. I found the long sections of the artist sketching his model extremely compelling. Even if you can't imagine this give the film a try. I have a friend who hates arty films particularly if they're in a foreign language. His favourite film is the Rock yet he started watching this with the sole aim of seeing Emmanuelle Beart in the buff which she is for most of the movie and ended up sitting through the whole four hours. It has a genuinely hypnotic quality.Aside from the debate about the art sections of the film its content is superb. The characters are real interesting and beautifully played. The Beart character in particular is a wonderful depiction of someone who is deeply scarred but erects a powerful veneer of independence to protect herself. As the artist sketches her from every angle he gradually gets under her defences until her entire personality is exposed on canvas. I know this sounds really pretentious but this film effectively argues that what marks out a masterpiece is that someone's soul  either the artist's or the model's  is put on canvas and in the process they and the people close to them are affected irrevocably. Ultimately the only real flaw in this film is I'm informed that the sketches themselves aren't actually that good. If you're like me and have a limited sensitivity to such things this shouldn't bother you. If not try not to let it spoil a beautiful rewarding and profoundly satisfying movie.".

The Beart character in particular is a wonderful depiction of someone who is deeply scarred but erects a powerful veneer of independence to protect herself. As the artist sketches her from every angle he gradually gets under her defences until her entire personality is exposed on canvas. I know this sounds really pretentious but this film effectively argues that what marks out a masterpiece is that someone's soul  either the artist's or the model's  is put on canvas and in the process they and the people close to them are affected irrevocably. Ultimately the only real flaw in this film is I'm informed that the sketches themselves aren't actually that good. If you're like me and have a limited sensitivity to such things this shouldn't bother you. If not try not to let it spoil a beautiful rewarding and profoundly satisfying movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "An absorbing fourhour masterpiece from Jacques Rivette. I cannot recall the last time I was so overwhelmed by a film.La Belle noiseuse is a brilliant character study buoyed by two astonishing performances from the alwayswonderful Michel Piccoli and the stunning Emmanuelle Bart. She's uncommonly gorgeous has the most piercing eyes of any actress in recent memory and the way she bares her character's soul is completely entrancing.This is a film for cineastes who enjoy complex vividlydrawn characters and the slow unfolding of a story. Rivette takes his time telling us this story. We see the artist Eduoard get his studio ready  collecting his pencils and brushes finding the sketchbook filling glasses with water rearranging the furniture moving aside paintings.And then there are those moments in this beautiful film where neither Eduoard nor Marianne speaks. All we see is the artist's hand scribbling in his notebook maybe the nude model's pose and her glare. The only sound is that of the artist's nib scratching paper as Rivette shows us the preliminary sketches the artist draws before he gets to the canvas.This goes on for several minutes yet it's far from dull. On the contrary it's absolutely riveting. We can't peel our eyes away from the artist's hand. We're captivated as the human form takes shape on the paper and canvas. It's brilliant stuff.This was the film that made Bart a star. Rightly so too. Her transformation from the loving wife to the reluctant model to ultimately the provocateur is utterly believable. Her performance doesn't have a false moment. It's as intelligent as it is provocative one that could easily have been overwrought but is played to perfection.The scenes between Piccoli and Bart are fascinating because their relationship grows so unconventionally. Rivette turns their relationship into an engrossing battle of wits. Initially Eduoard manhandles Marianne moving her arms and legs about as if she were a mannequin. She is shy uncomfortable with being nude. But as the hours progress into days her comfort level grows. Soon as the artist grows weary it's the model who spurs him on. True four hours is a heckuva long time to spend at a film. But there are hugely popular and wellmade thrillers that don't come close to being as mesmerizing as this exquisite work of art.".

Piccoli Bart Birkin and the others work little miracles all the time their interactions feel shrewd humane intense both mysterious where some background is yet missing to the viewer and utterly believable once it is revealed without trace of the usual highstrung film acting centered on the single significant moment and rammed down the public's throat in so many contemporary movies.2 The setting the Chateau d'Assas is completely integrated into and driving the story and is cleverly employed and fully respected in the mise n scne it is not a quarry for illustrative backdrops and environments but a real space conditioning the story just like the  personalities involved.3 The mise n scne and cadrage always leave the necessary breathing space and time for story and personality development and interaction. Nothing is ever forced or abbreviated  and yes this makes movies longer.The 'plot' is typical for Rivette as it contains a subtle fantastic element here the idea that a painter could find sum up condense and make visible the complete essence of a person in a painting. This fantasy lends urgency to the old dichotomies of life and art of love and creativity. It is otherwise a mere pretext to set the story in motion and expose the characters. In Balzac's 'Chef doeuvre inconnu' the attempt of Frenhofer to capture his model completely only led to a completely unreadable painting.The scenes where Marianne models for Frenhofer are to my knowledge  unique in cinema. They represent transparently both the very subtle interaction between painter and model and the genesis of the resulting sketch.To show spontaneous sketching of highest quality the hand of Bertrand Dufour was filmed while drawingpainting the posing Bart. Then Piccoli incorporated the gestures of the hand of Dufour into the scenes of Frenhofer and Marianne. Given the complexity and freedom in their interaction the tension and homogeneity of the assembled scenes is quite a miracle.No numerical vote of course one must never allow the quality of a piece of art to be in any way a subject to voting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Until last night I have shied away from this film due to its daunting 4hour length.  But watching Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse was not nearly as difficult as I feared it might be.  In fact it actually feels liberating to watch a film that doesn't limit itself to a predetermined time constraint.  With most films that rely heavily on an advancing plot any possible lulls may wear on the viewer.  La Belle Noiseuse boldly eschews the artifice of plot and standard pacing and deeply focuses on its story of an artist Frenhofer played by Michel Piccoli finding inspiration in a young model played by Emmanuelle Beart to paint again after a 10year hiatus.The drawing scenes alone really held my interest.  Presented with little dialogue they really made me feel as if I were witnessing art unfold which is nothing less than exhilarating.  It was also fascinating to see this in combination with the subtle development and changes that take place within Beart's character Marianne as she transforms from a fidgety resentful subject to an impassioned muse who sheds away all corporeal pretense and lends her bare soul to the canvas.  Giving support to the complex and nuanced performances of the two leads the waiflike Jane Birkin is also a standout in the role of Liz the artist's wife especially in the later scenes in which she expresses conflict with her husband's art.I am glad that I have finally seen this movie and I definitely encourage anyone with a curiosity about this movie to see it too.  All it requires is four hours of your time and an open mind.  La Belle Noiseuse is an extremely long film but never boring.  Watching this film is like slowly immersing your body into a hot bath.  Your enjoyment of it all depends on how willing you are to adapt yourself to its pacing.  But like a hot bath it takes a little adjustment.".

	schema:headline " If you have the patience La Belle Noiseuse is very rewarding.";
	schema:reviewBody "In his four hour drama La Belle Noiseuse French filmmaker Jacques Rivette has painted a haunting portrayal of an artist a model and the effects that a work can have on those involved. It is a brave piece of filmmaking featuring physical and emotional openness. The film moves very slowly but is very much worth watching. La Belle Noiseuse allows us to watch the creation of a piece of art and how it can change a person. This is a true accomplishment. The actors are all very much on key and with no real script provide real and believable dialogue. Rivette paints these characters in a very human way it's easy to imagine these people existing. There are no movie tricks. It's a truly naked film in that it offers such an intimate look into the hearts of the main characters. Anytime a film can do this you know it's something special.La Belle Noiseuse revolves around two couples. Marianne and Nicolas are a young couple. Nicolas is an artist and has been invited to take a look at the studio of Frenhofer a once revered and respected painter who has given up his art. While discussing a painting that Frenhofer never finished  the La Belle Noiseuse  Nicolas suggests that Frenhofer use Marianne as his model. Frenhofer agrees. However Marianne is not very happy about this. She arrives at the studio very disheartened. As Frenhofer draws and paints her the two of them get to know each other. Marianne's resentment falls away and she becomes more open with Frenhofer doing as he says asking him questions posing how he'd like. Frenhofer wants to dig deeper. As a painter he feels the need to really capture the essence of his model. His wife Liz was his last model. As a result of this need to dig deeper he was forced to either give up painting or give up his wife. The film spends much of its four hour running time in the studio with Marianne and Frenhofer. Otherwise there are scenes with Frenhofer and Liz as well as with Liz and Nicolas and Marianne and Nicolas who are growing apart by the day.For those who can endure the extreme running time La Belle Noiseuse is a fascinating film to watch. The characters as I said before are very real. Much of the film features Marianne played by the lovely Emmanuelle Beart posing nude. It's a bold performance for the actress who must bear her soul as well as her body in order for the performance to be effective. She is absolutely wonderful as is Michel Piccoli as the bitter painter. The only problem I have with the film is not that it's so long but that much of it focuses on the drawing. There are five and ten minute scenes where the audience watches Frenhofer sketch and paint. It's fascinating at first but eventually becomes a bit tedious. This should not steer anyone away though. Anyone who can appreciate slow moving character studies should be fine.To sum up I would recommend La Belle Noiseuse. However a person should probably know what they are getting into prior to watching. The film is not for everyone. It takes patience to enjoy but for those who can it is very rewarding. Jacques Rivette is a truly revolutionary director. The other film I've seen from him Celine and Julie Go Boating is just as wonderful as La Belle Noiseuse but is in a completely different universe. He is a very versatile unique and underrated director. La Belle Noiseuse shows this. It's a beautiful film.910".

In many of his films he loses himself amid his intellectual ideas and doesn't mind developing them while neglecting notions of storytelling progression in narration and time. Consequently the average length of his works is of about two hours and a half. Many filmmakers left very long films too. But they keep in mind that their films are destined to be understood by the general public and so obey to rules of clarification in their accessible stories.La Belle Noiseuse is one of his most palatable pieces of work in spite of its challenging length. It clocks in at 4 hours but don't panic time won't seem long to you for Rivette keeps a decent linearity from the first reunion with the main characters of the film to the surprising final denouement to the agreement of Marianne Emmanuelle Bart to serve as a model for the painter Frenhofer Michel Piccoli. Along their adventure some details will witness the progression of the story Marianne sleeps in Frenhofer's mansion while the latter falls asleep in his studio. An aesthetic refinement freely sourced from Honor De Balzac's novel the Unknown Masterpiece and perhaps the son of le Mystre Picasso 1956 by HenriGeorges Clouzot Rivette's piece of work is a dive in the twists and turns of artistic creation and all that it can comprise with its times of hopes doubts fears. Frenhofer naturally starts with a series of sketches and continues with numerous paintings attempts and countless testing poses for Marianne. The two characters are engaged in a creative process that is highly likely to leave them exhausted to say the least. The filmmaker deftly taps the scenery of the mansion and notably the studio where he locks for the major part of the film Marianne and Frenhofer for better and for worse. A painstaking care is given to sound with the squeaking of charcoal and brush. To better capture the sense of spontaneous creation Rivette fell back on methods worthy of the New Wavelet and notably Godard's he shot his film without a script near him and perhaps that's why many moments seem extemporaneous. But unlike Godard's smug works Rivette's one remains quite understandable as a whole.A dark legend surrounds this film about its success one of the few Rivette enjoyed all along his career. Was it due to Emmanuelle Bart's nudity? La Religieuse 1966 was banned because it was deemed as shocking for a major part of the population according to the censors. This banning contributed to the popularity of the film. So it would seem that Rivette has to put elements likely to be scabrous to make himself accepted by general public.".

There is no such thing as a piece of art that in a magic way encompasses deeper troublesome unknown truths about a portrayed person which will change the person's life forever which is a presumption in this movie. That is only a romantic clich. It is especially difficult to believe that the bleak and anonymous art created in this movie could have that effect. Art can  at its best reveal a lot of the artist and of the world as seen by the artist and  at rare moments  art can change the life of the spectator. But art that will change the life of the model? No I don't think that is very probable.But seen as a metaphor for one person the old painter helping another person the model to find new truths about herself it makes all the sense in the world. Then we can easily understand the models first resistance to the meeting with the painter the path leading through difficult moments and joyous moments and finally to the revelation of hidden truths that will change her life forever. She decides to leave her boyfriend.Seen in this way the surprising ending where the painting is stuck away for no one to see makes real sense. Of course it is only of value for the model to understand her inner truths you don't have to tell the world about them. The painter also was kind enough to do another portrait of her to show the world a portrait where the inner meanings again are hidden. A most satisfactory ending I would say. As a french nun once told me Il faut respecter le mystre de l'autre or You have to respect the mystery of the other. How true doesn't that ring.If a liked the movie? Yes it is mesmerizing all four hours. And the twists at the end complete the picture fully. It is a masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " Insightful Rivette! Marvelous performances from Michel Piccoli Jane Birkin and Emmanuelle Bart.";
	schema:reviewBody "Having seen Va Savoir recently prompted me to rent Jacques Rivette's 1990 La Belle Noiseuse a daunting runtime of 240 minutes though I noticed it was only 3 hr. 48 mins. It's well worth the time and experience. An experience in painting  nude figure drawing to be precise. But it's not a film merely about lessons in nude figure modeling from the beautiful Emmanuelle Bart or meticulous details of an artist's painting process from veteran actor Michel Piccoli there is a Rivette storyline depicting multiple relationships himself literally painting us psychological picturessketches. He's truly the French filmic master of human predicaments between man and woman. Rivette has such visions skillful techniques and superb craft in telling his story with thoughtful details  never misses a beat. The beginning scenes put us in a comfortable rural setting outside of Paris  beautiful open views of the village town captures of the villa architectural interiors and tastes of the lovely airy gardens and shady greens exterior. Yes there are plenty of dialogs but the inclusion of realtime ambient and environmental sounds made La Belle Noiseuse experience whole. It has the most wonderful ordinary sound of the studio door with latch creak opens and closes  it comes so naturally. There's the pen nib scratching against the sketchpad paper the chalk against the surface of a canvas even the quick ruffling of sheets when Bart the model swivelturned in defiance  such detailed little sounds simply add to the flavor and tone of the story. We see two pairs of relationship and then some between the mature and weathered pair of Edouard Frenhofer the painter and Liz his wife who used to be his favorite model portrayed by Michel Piccoli and Jane Birkin the younger set Marianne and Nicolas yet to absorb the trials and zest of life portrayed by Emmanuelle Bart and David Bursztein then the twists of the mercurial commercialminded Balthazar Porbus the unrelenting insistent Nicolas' sister Julienne with gentle relieving pauses from young Magali daughter of housekeeper Francoise not to forget Justine the Cat. Other then an Igor Stravinsky piece used for the beginningending credit roll and Magali's brief morning ballet exercise there's really no background music used. The occasional church bell rings sounds of cicada and rustling leaves provided serene accents. Much is said in the unsaid and the ending portion sure makes one wonder and prompts reflections. Rivette has a flair for unsuspecting ending drama almost philosophical or could it be renewed beginnings? The paintingsdrawings were from the hands of Bernard Dufour. Cinematography by William Lubtchansky especially inside the studio captured the critical chiaroscuro light and shadows of drawingmodeling sessions. Michel Piccoli is a regular in Luis Bunuel films Belle de Jour 1967 with Catherine Deneuve is one example. Jane Birkin has such a gentle yet fortified disposition she's in Bertrand Tavernier's Daddy Nostalgia 1990 opposite Dirk Bogarde. I really enjoy Emmanuelle Bart's performance in Claude Sautet's Nelly et Monsieur Arnaud 1995 with Michel Serrault who was equally brilliant.".

This is NOT one of those films. Picon as the artist and the lovely Emmanuelle Beart as his reluctant model are both too busy wrestling with their own souls to wrestle with each other. Picon is a oncegreat artist who has been stuck in creative limbo for years trying to create the one perfect painting.  When Beart arrives he hopes she may be the key to finally unlocking his skills creating that painting and regaining his selfwith as an artist.  Emmanuelle Beart is dragged into the situation by her boyfriend volunteering her services.  She is angry and disgusted at her boyfriend the artist and as is revealed herself.  She bares her body to the artist and the audience but more importantly as the film progresses she bares her soul.  By the way Emmanuelle is nude for the majority of her scenes.  Few actresses could pull of the powerfully emotional scenes she does stripped of clothing and pretense.The film actually works quite well as a play.  Most of the film takes place in the artist's studio and only involves the artist and model.  Of course if it were a play you have difficulty watching the artist work. And that may be where the movie has pacing problems  the camera is looking over the artist's shoulder as he draws and paints.  The movie sometimes switching gears an becomes a straight voiceless documentation of an artist actually at work.  An an artist myself I found this fascinating. BUT as an artist myself I really wish the director had chosen an artist with a more interesting style!  I mean a woman as lovely as Emmanuelle Beart deserves a Renoir and instead we get a Picasso.....".

	schema:reviewBody "I recommend this little film to you. It is an interesting confluence of two threads.One of these is the French New Wave itself. New Wave films are  were  stories combined with essays about filmmaking and associated matters. Nearly all these guys were film commentors before becoming filmmakers. The only problem was that the ideas about film weren't particularly deep or useful. And the merger of metastory with story was often clumsy. Now comes a film from one of these fellows someone eschewed by the group and not particularly interesting in the past. But he has set a very clever but simple construction to merge the film with a story about film here tokenized as a painting. In painting what is said doesn't count.The slant is successful because it is personal and dangerous and is about personal and dangerous things which brings us to the second thread movies about some other deep enterprise. Often this class is about painting but as likely we have mathematics music writing and dance. A touchstone of such movies is the genius and his or her struggles with the laws and forms of the world they've entered.The interesting thing about these films is how little they actually convey about that world. Movies about mathematics  movies like Pi or A Beautiful Mind or Good Will Hunting  are particular offenders. They don't seem to have ever understood the world in the first place much less found successful cinematic means to transport the uninitiated.But movies about the arts have a keen trap showing the art and its creation or performance. Thus in Hilary and Jackie we get the cellist sawing away in appropriate trance. In Pollack we see energetic dripping. In Girl with a Pearl Earring we see serious furrowed brow. But in terms of the story we might as well be watching someone with a banal passion a boxer say. There's nothing about the art no entry into the world. All we see are actors acting tortured or otherwise jostled by the art but never the art itself. Never do we leave our world and enter theirs. In terms of painting movies that's true of Pollack Earring Sirens and Stealing Beauty. Maze is a film about Tourette's done in a Tourette's style. Draughtsman's Contract is extraordinary in merging the drawing with what's drawn but even it avoids tourism into the mind of the artist.Not so here. In this case there's lots of talk but it is exposition in the service of helping us enter the world of the painter and his model. We do enter that world. We see art being developed and the art isn't just filler the artifacts act. The initial sketches are by a tentative lost artist and are indeed tentative and lost. As the thing develops we see the sketches change accordingly. We see many of them being made in an extraordinary mix of the actor's hand and that of a superb painter.Put these two threads together and you have  finally  the culmination of French New Wave a bona fide film that stands on its own merits that is also a film about the creative process of making a film. It works because we actually stand by the side of the painter filmmaker. We actually see the actressmodel as she hesitantly shows up gets engaged and ultimately has her engagement mature above her reach.This is Day for Night done right.And here's the amazing dramatic device we never see the painting. We see it secreted instead. At the end in good New Wave fashion the inner story is made to disappear as the metastory engulfs the finale.This has perhaps the best use of sharp sound in any film. The story itself for those interested is centered on Jane Birkin's character though most of the attention focuses on the painter and his new model. Birkin plays the painter's wife and former model. She captured his interest as a model and he began a masterpiece titled the same as this movie. He abandoned it because he knew he would destroy her soul if he finished it and he would rather have her love than continue as a painter. So he says and we believe them both.At some point near this decision she Birkin had an affair with the dealerpatron. He still loves her dearly and prompts the painter to get reinvolved with the project. His involvement is complex but not nearly as much as Birkin's who is employed literally as a taxidermist and as preserver of the aging lost painter.He reenters the world of decomposition of surfaces and elements. She does too with more art.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

We see many of them being made in an extraordinary mix of the actor's hand and that of a superb painter.Put these two threads together and you have  finally  the culmination of French New Wave a bona fide film that stands on its own merits that is also a film about the creative process of making a film. It works because we actually stand by the side of the painter filmmaker. We actually see the actressmodel as she hesitantly shows up gets engaged and ultimately has her engagement mature above her reach.This is Day for Night done right.And here's the amazing dramatic device we never see the painting. We see it secreted instead. At the end in good New Wave fashion the inner story is made to disappear as the metastory engulfs the finale.This has perhaps the best use of sharp sound in any film. The story itself for those interested is centered on Jane Birkin's character though most of the attention focuses on the painter and his new model. Birkin plays the painter's wife and former model. She captured his interest as a model and he began a masterpiece titled the same as this movie. He abandoned it because he knew he would destroy her soul if he finished it and he would rather have her love than continue as a painter. So he says and we believe them both.At some point near this decision she Birkin had an affair with the dealerpatron. He still loves her dearly and prompts the painter to get reinvolved with the project. His involvement is complex but not nearly as much as Birkin's who is employed literally as a taxidermist and as preserver of the aging lost painter.He reenters the world of decomposition of surfaces and elements. She does too with more art.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.";

It is morally reprehensible for a movie to show so much nakedness yet so little nookie. In exchange for taking the risk of our children accidentally seeing this and turning into nudists or something equally horrific cappuccinosipping art house snobs we deserve the highest possible return.Unfortunately most of La Belle Noiseuse takes place in one location. That's just not how a movie is supposed to be. If we want to look at the same house for hours we can do that without renting movies. We like The Shining 12 Angry Men and Phone Booth but those are American movies for mass consumption not French hipster chow for snotty college students. If we are going to put up with watching foreigners doing artsy stuff we should at least get a decent tour.So if you want to spend all day watching the same thing happening over and over again in the same place with occasional dramatic interruptions then suit yourself.

However if you want REAL entertainment no need to watch a different movie I suggest you take a peak at many of the favorable reviews of LBN. However if you're a fan of drivel like this you'll most likely enjoy them and mark this with a NO and then phone up all your friends to mark it with more NOs. Just make sure you don't break your keyboard when you smash a NO vote...Piccoli plays an old artist who has stopped paintingdrawing i.e. scribbling craponacanvas due to some tortured artist reasons. More likely he stopped because he lives in the South of France and he'd rather just have fun in the sun and have sex a bit occasionally wining and dining with friends. It's understandable. In the movie however the reason for this becomes apparent later he tried painting his wife and that pretty much ruined the fun in art forever for him. After all would YOU want to spend hours and days painting your wife? Especially when she looks like Jane Birkin. No wonder Piccoli is tortured suffering and all that with a wife like Birkin it's a miracle he didn't end up killing himself like all those young tortured poets.But... Voila! Ms.Beart enters the picture his life. She is young has a pretty face and likes to be naked in front of old men. What man old or young could resist that? Suddenly and veeeeery mysteriously Piccoli is interested in painting again! Of course officially his reasons are artistic not sexual. How dare I even suggest that an artist might think with his genitals first and his divine artistic soulmind second?? No no no Piccoli is NOT sexually attracted to the beautiful Beart he just wants to paint her because she has that certain... aaahh... jenesaisquoi. What follows in this monstrously long movie are scenes of Beart undressing dressing posing changing poses getting bored and Piccoli trying to calm himself down i.e. Piccoli hiding his pitched tent while trying to focus on his art. It is a pervert's dream. A movie the pervert doesn't have to hide from his visiting friends but actually boast about. Two flies with one swat watching breasts AND being able to pretend you're a clever artmovie lover. Or loveur.Occasionally there is some rather dull dialog that serves more as relief for male viewers who are struggling with their sexual feelings towards the naked Beart.In the end we get to see a large collection of drawings all based on the body of one called Beart. Needless to say the drawings are all horrible. All that effort and for nothing! The reason they are so bad is twofold 1 nowadays bad art sells better and 2 it is very difficult to concentrate on your artistic outpourings of inspiration when sexual feelings hang over you like an albatross. I understand Piccoli's character fully.Oh and those breasts are fake. This is Beart in her postsilicon preenlargedlipslikeaduck phase. I am not a fan of implants at all but I guess art lovers will not be bothered by the only bit of fakeness in an otherwise impressive feast of utter genuineness. The movie stinks of authenticity. It reeks. I'm impressed.I wonder what the shooting of this movie was like? Did Piccoli have sex with Beart every morning before the shooting commenced so he can focus more easily on his lines? No that can't be it. I just remembered he barely has any lines. He just sits there and draws.I once watched a chimp with a brush a canvas and some paint. There's much more to be learned from that...".

It would seem to me to be necessary that it is an outstanding film which this one isn't. Unless you are not familiar with the artistic process of lifedrawing and could be fascinated with it as a spectator sport then don't rent this movie you will be bored to tears. I multitasked during most of it. I have been an artist and the studio is familiar to me but I wouldn't impose the practice of sketching a nude on anyone. Of course there is the prurient interests in looking for extended amounts of time at a beautiful woman naked and if that's your thing then you will be richly rewarded. Second did the model get paid for her modeling or is this another movie about how we should all adore the artist so much that we give our time to him? I saw no money trading hands which would have raised the status of the model to some kind of equity. I might just me too American and too much of a feminist I am male but it seems that the French have this habit of adoring their women as long as they are attractive sex objects at the total disposal of male projects. That is what this movie is about. The two female characters are completely devoted to the rather pathetic artist. The movie was made in the nineties. Shame on you Rivette. But then you are one of the New Wave generation when women were treated repeatedly as sexual geegaws for the male protagonists so perhaps we should forgive you. Thirdly does anyone think his art was that good to deserve all this reverence? It seems pretty undergraduate lifedrawing class quality to me. This is another thing about French culture  after they have gotten rid of God and the king the artist takes his place. In this movie the artist lives in the largest and imposing villa of the village. Are we to think that this man's talent has provided him with enough success that he can live like a king? Fourthly are we to believe that the few conversations the artist has with his model has brought them both into some kind of personal transformation? I would need a lot more from them than what I saw on screen. We are to take the creative process of this man as so important that it is effecting all the characters including a sister of the boyfriend who ends up at the villa for no apparent reason. To risk being called a francophobe actually I love France and French Culture but it does have certain qualities that distinguish it from say Swedish or Swiss or German the French do seem to lean to the hysterical side of human functioning  like Liz the artist's wife telling the art dealer how she hated him and then calmly goes about the conversation smiling and kissing him when he leaves. I found lots of emotion in this movie that wasn't carrying cognitive content  like we as the viewers are to think that emotion alone makes a film complex and deep. I'm sorry its just a little too much to take. The movie is beautifully filmed as is the tradition of the French but it's aspiration to depth doesn't quite work for me. And please four hours!".

	schema:reviewBody "Flesh For Frankenstein of 1973 is a wonderfully grotesque bloody bizarre creepy hilarious artistic and absolutely brilliant slice of European Exploitation Horror that may not be missed by any lover of cultcinema. The first of two takes on classic Horror tales directed by Paul Morrissey starring Udo Kier and Joe Dallessandro and coproduced by iconic artist Andy Warhol the other being Blood For Dracula Flesh For Frankenstein which is sometimes referred to as Andy Warhol's Frankenstein is an ItalianFrenchAmerican coproduction that simply has to be seen to be believed.A blend of rich Gothic atmosphere grotesque artsy imagery unvarnished sleaze and excessive gore and wonderfully black humor Flesh For Frankenstein is both a tribute to and satire of earlier Horror greats. At the time of its release the film was highly controversial for its depiction of sex and gore and even received an XRating in the US No wonder as this unspeakably morbid little gem features all kinds of demented scenes including explicit perversions such as necrophilia all containing a very VERY morbid sense of humor.Udo Kier shines as a very demented Baron Frankenstein with a thick German accent who lives with his sisterwife ! Katrin Monique Van Vooren their two children as well as his equally demented assistant in a castle in Serbia. Frankenstein plans to create female and a male Zombie from body parts the natural children of his creations are then to become a perfect race of people. In the meanwhile the superpotent stablehand Nicholas Joe Dallesandro has sex with every female that crosses his way...Udo Kier fits perfectly in the role of the Baron  extremely demented perverted and weird Frankenstein constantly yells at his assistant for being a pervert. This Baron is dedicated to science and obsessed with results as are other Frankenstein versions in cinema such as those played by Colin Clive or Peter Cushing but unlike these predecessors he is also demented in every other imaginable way. Udo Kier is definitely one of Germany's greatest actors and doubtlessly THE remaining expert for sinister and eccentric characters since Klaus Kinski passed away. He is truly great here. Monique van Vooren is also very good as the Baron's equally malicious sisterwife  van Vooren looks very young for her age she was 48 when the film was made but also really weird since she has no eyebrows. Italian Horror enthusiasts will notice that the Frankenstein couple's daughter is played by Nicoletta Elmi who was in many other cultclassics such as Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso 1975 Mario Bava's Bay of Blood 1971 and Baron Blood 1972 as well as Aldo Lado's Giallo Who Saw Her Die? 1972.Flesh For Frankenstein is a film that is very gory and outrageously morbid for its day. When I first saw it some scenes even reminded me of Joe D'Amato's 1979 shocker Buio Omega though this film isn't quite AS demented and sick as D'Amato's film. IMDb and some other sources credit Italian Horror deity Antonio Margheriti who happens to be an idol of mine as codirector of this film however it appears that Margheriti was merely credited to draw Italian viewers into cinemas and had little to nothing to do with the actual production of the film. Either way this is a mustsee. Flesh For Frankenstein is a wonderfully bizarre atmospheric gory demented morbid incredibly and VERY darkly funny film that MUST be seen by all cultcinema fans and personally I cannot understand how anyone could not love it. My rating 1010".

	schema:headline " Good Clean Fun!";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the first of 2 films made in quick succession by Paul Morrissey in Italy in 1973. Blood for Dracula was the other. Flesh for Frankenstein was obviously made with it's tongue firmly in it's cheek. It's a step beyond anything Hammer attempted in this genre especially regarding gore and dodgy accents! Udo Kier and Arno Juerging are possibly the best comic duo to hit the screens since Abbot  Costello as the Baron and faithful sidekick Otto! Whether fooling around in the lab or scouting for suitable organs they never fail to raise a smile. Kier gets all the best lines letting us know his views on gall bladders and his plans for the new race he is ..ehm.. putting together. Monique Van Vooren is more sinister as the Baroness who initially appears relatively normal in comparison to her husband at least. However her eccentricities become apparent as the film goes on. Joe Dallesandro is on screen a lot but his character doesn't contribute much to the plot. Presumably his name was used to garner publicity for the film in the US. The Frankenstein kids take after their parents and are crucial to the twist at the end of the film. The young actors playing the kids do a good job. The actors playing the Baron's works in progress don't have much to do even when their characters are brought to life. Certainly the film will not be to everybody's taste. There is plenty of gore and some dodgy sex scene sound effects. The scene showing the Baron's interest in the female creation and her innards pushes the boundaries a bit but it is too over the top to be anything more than comical. So sit back and enjoy this piece of 70's schlock horror.".

Udo Kier and Arno Juerging are possibly the best comic duo to hit the screens since Abbot  Costello as the Baron and faithful sidekick Otto! Whether fooling around in the lab or scouting for suitable organs they never fail to raise a smile. Kier gets all the best lines letting us know his views on gall bladders and his plans for the new race he is ..ehm.. putting together. Monique Van Vooren is more sinister as the Baroness who initially appears relatively normal in comparison to her husband at least. However her eccentricities become apparent as the film goes on. Joe Dallesandro is on screen a lot but his character doesn't contribute much to the plot. Presumably his name was used to garner publicity for the film in the US. The Frankenstein kids take after their parents and are crucial to the twist at the end of the film. The young actors playing the kids do a good job. The actors playing the Baron's works in progress don't have much to do even when their characters are brought to life. Certainly the film will not be to everybody's taste. There is plenty of gore and some dodgy sex scene sound effects. The scene showing the Baron's interest in the female creation and her innards pushes the boundaries a bit but it is too over the top to be anything more than comical. So sit back and enjoy this piece of 70's schlock horror.";

It's the typical Frankenstein story with the Morrissey's spin on it.  And I suspect that it has a lot to do with Antonio Margheriti being involved since he is famous in Italian horror circles for the gore effects he brings to films.  Especially the scene where the male monster Srdjan Zelenovic rips open his stomach sutures exposing his organs in an act of suicide. Very anatomically correct.Udo Kier is probably the best reason to see this film however.  His hammy acting skills are tops!  His version of Frankenstein is so demented I guess the German accent adds a lot to it.  Usually it's an American or English actor who plays Frankenstein so having a real life German speaking in English of course adds to the atmosphere.And of course Joe Dallesandro's New York accent sounds totally out of place here just as it did in BLOOD FOR DRACULA.  He sounds like a male hustler hanging out in Times Square instead of an Italian stable boyAlso hideous is Monique Van Vooren as Baroness.  Good gawd the Dallesandro character must have been real hardup in order to sleep with that old hag.Still it has decent atmosphere and the Criterion DVD uses a widescreen print that looks crystal along with production stills of the movie secondary commentary track by Morrissey who has some revealing comments about the film and some silly pseudointellectual commentary by Maurice Yakowar that a trashy film like this doesn't deserve. Worth seeing mostly for Kier's presence.6 out of 10".

At the same time it's beautifully photographed like much Italian giallo Bava Argento even the most horrific images are rendered eerily beautiful by the lush color and widescreen. Udo Kier plays Baron Frankenstein as a protoNazi obsessed with creating a master race Monique Van Vooren is deliciously campy as his oversexed wife and Joe Dallesandro with his flat Brooklyn accent resembles a young Marlon Brando as Nicholas the stable boy the only decent human being in the film. Many have commented that he was out of place in the movie but that was the point he was the allAmerican good guy lost in a world of sleek but slimy eurotrash. Particularly disturbing were the two almostmute children who resemble nothing so much as Wednesday and Pugsley Addams. Like Bunuel's Viridiana there is an unmistakable hint of incest the Baron and Katharine are clearly brother and sister and they seem to be grooming their children to take their place. This movie joins Salo and El Topo in the pantheon of disturbing 70s cult films.".

Amongst others there was The Erotic Rites of Frankenstein and Frankenstein '80  both from 1972  so it can be not too much of a surprise that a year later came the king of this very specific subgenre the one and only Flesh For Frankenstein. It was famously produced by New York Pop artist Andy Warhol along with the similar Blood For Dracula. But it's a far cry from Warhol's other art films and unsurprisingly his creative input was pretty negligible. It was filmed in Cinecitt studios in Rome and directed by Warhol acolyte Paul Morrissey. But irrespective of who did what and why the main thing about this one is that it's a bona fide trash classic of the very best kind.Its blood and guts galore and transgressive sex all the way. But it's all presented in a camp manner that simply has to be seen to be believed. The acting ranges from insanely overthetop Udo Kier to hilariously underthetop Joe Dallesandro. What makes it so very funny is that despite the sheer ridiculousness of proceedings everybody plays it deadpan straight. We have Kier fully committed and out of control as the Nazilike Baron who dreams of making a new master race Dallesandro is a local shepherd stud with a hilariously out of place New York accent  he seems more like a Times Square street hustler than a character from the early 19th century then there is Arno Juering in a bewildering performance as the eyepopping Otto assistant to the Baron Monique Van Vooren makes an impression too as the Baron's oversexed wifesister even the couples incestual offspring are memorably creepy the little girl being the one and only Nicoletta Elmi who appeared in dozens of Italian horror and giallo flicks in the early 70's.Flesh For Frankenstein was also noteworthy for being one of the members of the infamous video nasty list which of course was a selection of movies deemed criminally obscene by the British authorities back in the early 80's. It's an example of an entry from this list where you sort of understand why it caused offence in the first place. Not only does it have a healthy dose of explicit gore  including a hilariously overthetop finale  but it is wilfully transgressive in other outrageous ways with the brothersisterhusbandwife incest plot strand and the baron's necrophiliac behaviour with his zombie creations. Of course all of this excessive content funny performances and insane dialogue adds up to a mustsee movie for anyone with a passing interest in Euro horror from the schlockier end of the scale. On top of all of this it's actually a quite handsome looking film which is perhaps unsurprising given its Cinecitt origins. Suffice to say that all of this adds up to a cult film truly worthy of the tag. Its additionally well worth seeking out its sister film Blood For Dracula which is slightly less psychotronic but equally indispensable.".

It's seem like it was trying to be a smart arthouse film that it's somewhat get lost with the slow pace delivery in exploitation grindhouse film. The way the movie delivers this plot is hysterical camp with horrible acting and bad special effects. The gruesomeness of the action with several disembowelments being shot from a 3D perspective was laughable. Udo Kier sounds and acts like a mix between Peter Lorre Ren from Ren  Stimpy and Tommy Wiseau. It's really hard to understand what he is saying. The supporting cast deliver their lines with less emotion. Even with the gross Necrophilia and incest theme. With better actors and special effects the doctor's sublimation of his sexual urges by his powerful urge for domination could had work. The movie really does mirror Adolf Hitler in his lust of power. You see it through symbolism like trying to find the right nose for the creature. Like Baron Hitler found Jews to be inadequate and often brand them with long untrusting noses. The movie has a powerful message about sexually repressed leading to social disembowelment. Indeed maybe Hitler lack of sex did cause the world to go into war. It's hard to take the sex scenes serious. Especially when his wifesister is sucking on a guy's armpit with odd sound effects. It get weirder as the gallbladder is use as a sex object in this film. I think its hints to Andy Warhol's survival after the botch assassination. Indeed Andy Warhol's lungs his spleen stomach liver and esophagus were hit. Hints why the lungs were on the desk in the film. While he did survive the effects of it would haunt him for the rest of his life. Andy Warhol was known to have recurring gallbladder problems after the shooting. Indeed it was his delay of a checkup that might cause his death in 1987 after routine gallbladder surgery. The ending to the film is very powerful with how generations and generations would continue to repeat the same mistakes. The movie does have some good things about it seeing how rushed it was made in production with 1 month of shooting it's was mostly shot beautifully with divine music score to go with it. Overall While the movie was trying to be a smart satire of horror movies. Somebody's derped with their work and it didn't deliver how what they really wanted. Still it's worth watching if you're an Andy Warhol or Frankenstein fan.".

Featuring a lush dreamlike feel that is helped along by a gorgeous and haunting music score and top notch costumes. The gore although extreme possesses a kind of poetry and i can imagine such sexually eroticized violence must have caused quite a controversy in the UK at the time of release. Udo Kier is superb in his maniacal portrayal of Dr. Frankenstein and the changes and additions to the Mary Shelley novel are for once very smart and a welcome addition to an already great tale. Aside from the 1933 film Bride of Frankenstein this is my absolute favorite screen version of the Frankenstein monster. Excellent film!".

	schema:reviewBody "This messy little splatterfest was heavily censored in most markets back in the 70s and fully restored its wildly lurid visuals can still shock. The movie is all about the visuals and the splatter and is so over the top that it gets a bit silly. The exploitation elements of the Frankenstein story  the graverobbing the obsessive experiments in mad science  have never been this wildly exploited and manage to straddle spoofery and shock cinema about equally well. This is not to say that this is in any way a good movie. It's almost a joke on the audience. The script is complete trash straight out of a bad Gothic novel and probably meant to be laughed at but played straightfaced by the film's 'actors'. The 'acting' is pretty horrible. Udo Keir is his usual creepy Eurotrash self and even moderately effective in a onenote performance but he's the only cast member who has any business being in a period piece. Everybody else especially Warhol protg and gay icon Joe Dallesandro is just too urbancontemporary not to mention inexperienced to pull off a 19th century look or 19th century speech. The women look decorative and shed their tops fairly often but don't look for a romantic subplot or a strong female character because there aren't any. As straightforward drama this movie would get about 12 a star. My rating is based on its effectiveness as an exercise in subverting audience expectations and slamming the Gothic horror genre which after 15 straight years of Hammer and Roger Corman had become a bit ripe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possibly the oddest reimagining of the Frankenstein story ever made Paul Morrissey's 1973 semiavantgarde satirical spoof is also one of the funniest and most gruesome. Dr. Von Frankenstein played by Bmovie favourite Udo Kier is obsessed with creating what he believes will become a master race of Serbians who will bend at his will. He locks himself away with his assistant Otto Arno Juerging manufacturing hideous creations from body parts. He creates a male and a female to give birth to the first of his new race but he is frustrated and unsatisfied with the male's sexual urges. Von Frankenstein's wifesister meanwhile is following her own urges with farmhand Nicholas Joe Dalessandro who is coincidentally the best friend of the doctor's latest victim.One of the strangest pairings in cinema history director Morrissey and producer Andy Warhol have certainly created an interesting piece of horror. For all it's rather sick moments of debauchery it is actually quite impressive artistically. Filmed in Cinecitta in Rome one of Federico Fellini's favourite film studios the set design for Von Frankenstein's laboratory in vast and impressive. This approach works both for and against the film as although it gives the film a grand often operatic feel the film can sometimes look like it's on stage. That said Morrissey's ability to frame a shot is often spectacular especially in the ultrawide dinner table scene where Von Frankenstein introduces his wifesister to his fresh creations.Yet sometimes the film can feel a bit confused. It works well just a straight Bmovie with plenty of the weird and gruesome on show to satisfy horror fans given those fans are into watching sex with torso wounds. But the film isn't really funny enough to call itself a comedy clever enough to call itself a satire or pretentious enough to be avantgarde. All these different themes seemed to clash together and I never felt settled with what kind of film I was supposed to be watching. If that was the point then well done but it still doesn't make the movie into anything special.Saying that I did thoroughly enjoy 90 minutes in the minds of two strange characters that had a small if fascinating effect on cinema.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "First there was 1931's Frankenstein then there were decades of sequels and remakes everything from Bride Of Frankenstein to Frankenstein's Castle Of Freaks. Some years later a rebellious filmmaker named Paul Morrisey would reinvent this classic yet again in the form of 70's exploitation making this one of the most meanspirited yet poetic horror masterpieces of the 20th Century. This is Frankenstein presented by Paul Morrissey... I mean Andy Warhol.As usual a mad scientist in his European castle married to his eccentric sister Monique Van Vooren is obsessed with creating life. Baron Frankenstein along with his assistant Otto stalk kidnap kill and mutilate anyone who has the right male parts. As it turns out Frankenstein has everything all in order that is except the head of the male. The still dead female is ready as well. Once the male is complete they will be brought to life and Baron can somehow convince them to get it on hence creating a new race of zombies who will obviously look to Baron as their leader. Until then the Doctor makes it a point to break in the female for his male creation. Meanwhile Joe Dallesandro is on to this guy and his insane aspirations. Joe recognizes the head of the male creation that's his buddy's head on that damn thing. Something must be done. So for the first time in his Warhol career Joe is gonna do something. Whether it works or not that may or not be a different story. Oh well regardless of what happens this is still by far Joe's finest performance. At least there's that.This film is just as hardhitting as it wants to be flaunting all kinds of gore raunchiness more perverted tendencies than ever even a necro scene this is some swell horror I tell you. Andy Warhol's name on this swell horror as usual was his only connection. This one is all about Udo Kier just a golden performance but let's not forget Paul Morrissey for creating such a pitchblack version of the fable. What really makes Flesh For Frankenstein so entertaining is the awkward yet hilarious relationship between Udo Kier and Arno Juerging. The things that come out of their mouths absolutely priceless. It wasn't long before Morrissey created his own version of Dracula a masterpiece as well although I like this one better. Blood For Dracula and Flesh For Frankenstein are perfect examples of what horror should be. The legendary classic horrors of the 30's and 40's were fine but Paul Morrissey's Xrated bastards of horror basically gives all that stuff the finger which makes it all the more appealing. How Morrissey could go from directing something like Women In Revolt to this is beyond me. For more awsomeness from Udo Kier check out Mark Of The Devil and for more humorous indifference from Joe Dallesandro check out Andy Warhol's Trash. As for this one I passionately recommend this masterpiece to Horror enthusiasts who like it rough. 1010".

	onyx:emotionText "First there was 1931's Frankenstein then there were decades of sequels and remakes everything from Bride Of Frankenstein to Frankenstein's Castle Of Freaks. Some years later a rebellious filmmaker named Paul Morrisey would reinvent this classic yet again in the form of 70's exploitation making this one of the most meanspirited yet poetic horror masterpieces of the 20th Century. This is Frankenstein presented by Paul Morrissey... I mean Andy Warhol.As usual a mad scientist in his European castle married to his eccentric sister Monique Van Vooren is obsessed with creating life. Baron Frankenstein along with his assistant Otto stalk kidnap kill and mutilate anyone who has the right male parts. As it turns out Frankenstein has everything all in order that is except the head of the male. The still dead female is ready as well. Once the male is complete they will be brought to life and Baron can somehow convince them to get it on hence creating a new race of zombies who will obviously look to Baron as their leader. Until then the Doctor makes it a point to break in the female for his male creation. Meanwhile Joe Dallesandro is on to this guy and his insane aspirations. Joe recognizes the head of the male creation that's his buddy's head on that damn thing. Something must be done. So for the first time in his Warhol career Joe is gonna do something. Whether it works or not that may or not be a different story. Oh well regardless of what happens this is still by far Joe's finest performance. At least there's that.This film is just as hardhitting as it wants to be flaunting all kinds of gore raunchiness more perverted tendencies than ever even a necro scene this is some swell horror I tell you.

Camp performances lurid splatter and softcore shenanigans actually go to make this an outrageous piece of degenerate trash that is hard to take seriously unless you're a Daily Mail reader or a Tory politician.Udo Kier gives a wonderfully hammy turn as Baron Frankenstein the accent he adopts way overthetop so as to complement the silly dialogue and the rest of the cast follow his lead giving equally exaggerated performances. Among the tasteless subjects touched upon by the tacky script are eugenics necrophilia and incest and to add to the film's overall exploitative nature the whole thing was shot in glorious 3D allowing the severed limbs spurting blood and messy viscera to dangle right in front of the viewer's face.After an hour and a half of amazingly lurid nonsense chock full of nudity and violence the film wraps up in a darkly humorous manner by seeing most of the characters meet their fate in a variety of gruesome ways with the hero of the piece womanising stableboy Nicholas Joe Dallesandro left suspended helplessly from a crane in the laboratory as the baron's children the only other survivors slowly approach him scalpels in hand ready to continue their father's work.".

I hope that was the intent. The dialog is campy and ridiculous the acting is over the top the subject matter is disturbing the gore is pretty extreme and the story is pretty far from the touching haunting tale that Shelley originally penned. It is a macabre comedy of power gone unchecked as well as inbreeding necrophilia organs fetishes just for starters! with pretty great bloody special effects and super creepy children.

Christopher Reeve will always be Clark Kent Superman for me no one else can replace him I don't care what anyone says. I kept wining to my parents that I want to see Superman movie and in the video store a lady video store owner gave me Superman III on VHS when I was a kid and it was the only movie she had. Superman III is MILES way better than crappy lame Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice I hate those movies. I find this film enjoyable welldone and extremely underrated. The effects  technology are extremely dated especially the computers but this is still a decent welldone film. Plot Synthetic kryptonite laced with tobacco tar splits Superman in two good Clark Kent and bad Man of Steel. Thing's I love in this movie why I gave the most highest rating in this film and why I am defending itChristopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark KentSuperman like Christopher Reeve If anyone could be Superman It is Christopher Reeve! The opening sequence with the fools of Metropolis was amusing in a slapstick way this intentionally reminded me of some of the old slapstick routines from years before Laurel  Hardy Three Stooges etc.. And sure a lot of Superman III was comedic but a lot of this was just in line with the Gus Gorman Richard Pryor character. SupermanClark going back to Smallville for his high school reunion  running into Lana Lang Annette O'Toole etc. Very cool sequence and I liked seeing Superman return to his roots. Also based on the reunion you get an idea of the character's ages  i.e. the reunion said Class of 1965  since the film came out in 1983 and supposedly was set in real time then Clark  his classmates were all around 36 years old at that point.This film focus more on Lana Lang Clark's first love Lois was Clark's eternal Love but Lana was his first love. Annette O'Toole was perfectly as Lana Lang after long 18 years Annette was cast as Martha Kent in Smallville. In Superman The Movie Lana Lang was played by actress Diane Sherry and she only had a cameo scene and than she disappeared from the rest of the film. Here we find out more about Clark and Lana's love! I saw Clark and Lois in the first two films but now we see more Clark and Lana's love story. Superman save's Ricky Paul Kaethler Lana's son in the corn filed from the tractor that scene was really serious the kid could have been seriously crushed it that could have happened in real life. This film was filmed and released in year of 1983 the year that I was born. This was my first Superman movie and it is my childhood film I love it to death and I will always cherished. The whole sequence where Superman was exposed to the Red Kryptonite though they didn't call it that in the episode and became darksomewhat evil. They did a great job of transforming SupermanClark to look dirtyunshavenburned out even his costume was darker! and not only disinterested in helping others  but also being somewhat malicious as well. I especially liked the battle that Superman had with his good  bad selves in the junkyard I'm guessing this battle may have been metaphorical. It was also interesting on another level because we saw what would happen if Superman had been evil instead of good. That scene was also used in Smallville Season 2 Episode 4 Red Clark was exposed to Red kryptonite and he evil. Richard Pryor as the scam artist Gus Gorman was good and hilarious the same time  obviously because of his inclusion many fans probably dismissed the film as a comedy however his presence brought a lightheartiness to the film that was reminiscent of the comedic Ned Beatty character from Superman I  II. Christopher Reeve was perfect as Clark KentSuperman he acted brilliant his character he is the only Superman and superhero for me.This is Richard Lester original version film and he didn't had to re shot scenes from Richard Donner. The rest of the actors did a solid job and I really didn't had any problems with them. Robert Vaughn was a great villain I am glad the franchise had a new villain in all films Lex Luthor was five time the villain in all Superman franchise movies.Ross Webster was a great villain and the scene where Vera Annie Ross becomes a robot and she becomes evil really scares me. Brad Wilson played by Gavan O'Herlihy Lana's former boyfriend the character from the first film also returns in the first film he was played by Brad Flock.Superman III is a 1983 British superhero film directed by Richard Lester based on the DC Comics character Superman. It is the third film in the Superman film series and the last Superman film to be produced by Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind. I love this film to death and it is my second favorite and the last good Superman film.".

And things became really funny or were at least supposed to be. If you consider campy to be funny.Superman faces off against himself after being exposed to a new form of kryptonite that has tobacco tar mixed in. Can the world trust a Superman who destroys oil tankers and sleeps with random women on top of the Statue of Liberty? The best part of the Evil Superman sequence is when we see Superman drunk if for no other reason than the thought of Superman getting drunk or even having the ability to become intoxicated is a most unusual thought. Good thing Superman doesn't drive a car.I really enjoyed the entrance of Lana Lang into the film. Lana in my opinion was always the more appropriate match for Superman and there is no exception in this movie. She shares a history with him is more caring than Lois and less dominant. I'm curious where the LoisLana thing will go in Part 4 if it goes anywhere. I am not suggesting dominant women are bad by the way. But the fact of the matter is anyone dating Superman is going to have to be comfortable with being second fiddle. What sold me on this movie and almost scored it a 7 instead of a 6 is the tiein with Office Space. In Office Space Superman III is referenced for a computer program that takes fractions of a cent and puts them in a bank account. The scene in this film was great and really made me appreciate the way Mike Judge used it many years later.With nicotine and tar being the secret ingredients in the new kryptonite was there some message being sent? Richard Pryor was great. He was funny and made the entire film more of a comedy with kitsch than the serious films we had seen before. Many people really didn't like the campiness I guess but I thought it was enjoyable for the most part though they did go over the top just a bit. In my mind Superman was the light story and Batman the dark story so I'd rather see a silly Superman than a silly Batman.The new villain to replace Lex Luthor was okay but why bother making a new villain if he's going to be the exact same character? I would hope after fifty years of comic books there would have been at least one other super villain they could have chosen although the new Superman Returns focuses on Luthor again so I guess creativity is minimal in the Superman world.If you've seen parts one and two you may as well see this. But do keep in mind that the world of Superman turns a little bizarro for the next two hours of film time...".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the overwhelming hatred for Superman III I gotta say that I think it's an excellent film. One of the two best of the whole Superman saga actually. The other of course is the original film. But Superman III is so much fun and a great example of how it's possible for Superman to have enemies OTHER than Lex Luthor. The guy's been the main villain in how many is it FOUR of the now FIVE Superman films? I liked Gene Hackman's Luthor far superior to Kevin Spacey's but you gotta take a break at some point. No Superman III is a refreshing change of pace not only in that respect but in several ways.Most noticeable and much to the chagrin of many people is the slightly more comedic tone of the film centered mainly around Richard Pryor's character August 'Gus' Gorman. I thought Prior was great. He plays an overthetop character in a movie series about an overthetop character. I hear people complain all the time that they hate the comedy that Prior brought to the film because Superman is supposed to be and these are actual quotes gritty and realistic. NO he's not. Superman is not gritty and he's not realistic. Never was never will be. Richard Donner's original doesn't even come CLOSE to playing it straight. Just look at how he portrays Clark Kent. In the comic books and 1950's television series the mildmannered Clark Kent is treated with respect and professionalism. He basically coexists amongst his peers at the Daily Planet. In Superman The Movie Richard Donner has taken the character straight out of the old comics and TV series with all the same mannerisms and morals and placed him in a very modern 1978. This is a setup for much of the films adequate amount of comedy relief. Superman The Movie is not a comedy. Neither is Superman III but they both have comic relief. The Clark Kent character is slightly more serious in this one thus you have Gus. A funny little man with an interesting power. A savantlike intellect that gives him complete control over any computer system.I especially like how Clark Kent Superman's alterego is fleshed out more as he returns home to Smallville. This is a great followup to Richard Donner's brief exploration to Superman's early years in Smallville. The inclusion of Lana Lang as Clark's high school crush was great even better in that they chose the lovely Annette O'Toole to portray the character. I LOVE Margot Kidder but I think Lana is a very important character in Superman's backstory.All the delving into Clark Kent's character and background leads us to one of the greatest scenes in motion picture history... Clark Kent vs. Evil Superman. I could sit here and expound on the scene's metaphoric implications all day long but simply put I found it jawdropping. Christopher Reeve was always perfect as Superman but his best work is here in this scene. Evil Superman is a very physical representation of everything ClarkSuperman has ever repressed and obviously we're talking about a lot of repression here. It's great stuff. I still wanna cheer every time the victorious Clark Kent opens his shirt to reveal his famous insignia which by the way is differentiated by Evil Superman's in that it's excessively bright where as his was really dark and dingy looking. Having been a Superman fan since I was a kid way back in the day that's one of those scenes I'll remember 'till the day I die. I remember it from my childhood but it's actually more relateable for me now as an adult.Superman III is one of the greats. If you haven't seen it yet I only ask that you watch it with an open mind and not look for grit or realism where it has no place being. Instead just believe a man can fly... again.".

Superman II was Richard Donner's creation and Lester simply took over and wisely kept the tone of the film but with some added humor. This time around the humor steers the film as it's mostly a Richard Pryor vehicle. It doesn't come as much of a surprise that the film fares best when focusing on the Man of Steel whether he's romancing an old flame in Smallville or in high flying action.This is also the film where Superman goes bad and fights his alter ego to the death. Those scenes are the best in the film. Some set pieces are pretty good and special effects are decent. However the finale has to be deemed utterly ridiculous when Superman battles a sophisticated computer! Reeve is amazing as SupermanClark Kent. Effortlessly switching to playing a meaner version of himself he's simply perfect. Richard Pryor is always the same so if you're a fan of his work you'll love him here. Everyone else is decent except those three villains they're a little too much especially Vaughn.A lot less humor and more seriousness would have made the film very good.".

Well I thought it was at first. But when I watched it in numerous reruns I began to like this. Christopher Reeve excellently reprises his role alongside comedy favorite Richard Pryor as a computerwhiz who is hired by his boss to help fulfill his plans for world domination. Pryor may not do it right sometimes but he's admittedly hilarious in spots. But painfully ridiculous in some. Among the things that make it a bit unsatisfying for critics is the lack of the characters from the originals. Lois lane had to go on vacation so Lana Lang played well by Annette O'Tooleis Superman'sClark Kent's love interest. Robert Vaughn plays a sinister mastermind an okay replacement for the famous villain Lex Luther. What some viewers don't understand is that director Richard Lester wants it to be more of a comic book adventure rather than what scriptwriter Mario Puzo did in the first two. Rating 12 out of 5.".

Everyone always looks down on this movie but it was a really good addition to the Superman movies.Basic storyline MINOR SPOILERS Richard Pryor is Gus Gorman a computer genius who becomes involved in a scheme where he writes a computer program to steal money from his company. See OFFICE SPACE He is caught and then blackmailed by the company's owner Ross Webster. Robert Vaughn It turns out they sort of blackmail each other  Webster makes Gus reprogram the weather satellite to control the weather and change the course of oil tankers. He also has Gus create a recipe for Kryptonite to get Superman out of the picture. On the other hand Gus makes Webster's company build him a supercomputer.Meanwhile SupermanClark Kent is back in his hometown of Smallville where he rekindles an old flame with sweetheart Lana Lang Annette O'Toole who ironically plays Clark's mom on the SMALLVILLE TV series. Superman comes in contact with the homemade Krytptonite and all havoc breaks loose.The most exciting sequence of SUPERMAN III has to be the Clark KentSuperman fight in the junkyard. The final fight with Superman vs. the supercomputer PacMan sounds included is also pretty good.SUPERMAN III is my 2nd favorite movie in the Superman series. Better than SUPERMAN I  IV but not as good as Superman II.".

	onyx:emotionText "SUPERMAN III rocks. Everyone always looks down on this movie but it was a really good addition to the Superman movies.Basic storyline MINOR SPOILERS Richard Pryor is Gus Gorman a computer genius who becomes involved in a scheme where he writes a computer program to steal money from his company. See OFFICE SPACE He is caught and then blackmailed by the company's owner Ross Webster. Robert Vaughn It turns out they sort of blackmail each other  Webster makes Gus reprogram the weather satellite to control the weather and change the course of oil tankers. He also has Gus create a recipe for Kryptonite to get Superman out of the picture. On the other hand Gus makes Webster's company build him a supercomputer.Meanwhile SupermanClark Kent is back in his hometown of Smallville where he rekindles an old flame with sweetheart Lana Lang Annette O'Toole who ironically plays Clark's mom on the SMALLVILLE TV series. Superman comes in contact with the homemade Krytptonite and all havoc breaks loose.The most exciting sequence of SUPERMAN III has to be the Clark KentSuperman fight in the junkyard. The final fight with Superman vs. the supercomputer PacMan sounds included is also pretty good.SUPERMAN III is my 2nd favorite movie in the Superman series. Better than SUPERMAN I  IV but not as good as Superman II.";

	schema:reviewBody "I love this movie for those of you think it's really bad because it's too ridiculous you must not read too many of the comics. The very first comics I never read were Superman comics and that was when I hadn't even got into kindergarten and let me tell you they could be pretty silly but never boring.The same could be said for this movie. First of all I love Richard Pryor and he has a field day in this movie. Secondly I love Robert Vaughn and he plays a really juicy villain in this one. And then there's this great fight scene between two Supermen... but I don't want to give away everything from those of you haven't seen the film yet.There is everything you should expect in this kind of movie. My only complaint was not enough Lois Lane Margo Kidder and maybe I'm nitpicking but continuity with the other two films seems to be ignored completely. According to this entry in the series Clark graduated from Smallville high in 1962. The problem with that is that in the first film is clear that when Clark is in high school it's the late 1940s by the vintage cars and trucks in the scenes. But hey if we can believe that a man can come from another planet fly see through walls burn through things with his eyes and lift trains into the air then why bitch about little things like continuity?Not only do I have this baby on video from cable TV but I also taped the network version just for the outtakes and edited out every single commercial. The beautifully choreographed opening credits with the blind man some mechanical penguins on fire and more is even longer and better in the TV version.So hate this one if you must but I will take it over the second film any the day of the week. That is the Richard Lester version. I LOVED the Richard Donner cut which recently made it to DVD.I give it a 7 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Great Superman sequel  underrated by traditionalists";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is not worthy of the 910 I gave it. But I saw that the average was below 5 and I feel the need to corrupt the statistics. I want to increase this average so that score is a truer reflection of the quality and public's perception of this film.Many may think that this is unfair or unreasonable. But I regard it as a reflex reaction to traditionalists who gave it '1' because it strayed from the typical superman formula irrespective of whether it was a good film in its own right... and it was! Since they are unfairly underrating the film I feel justified in overrating the film..... DEAL WITH IT! The traditionalists want the love interest Lois Lane to feature prominently along with the naive Jimmy Olsen the ranting Perry White and the conniving and ruthless Lex Luthor.Well Jimmy breaks his leg in the first 15 minutes and is presumably hospitalised for the rest of the film Lois kidder makes a cameo appearance at the start of the film to let us know that she's going on holiday Lex  his numbskull sidekick Otis isn't even mentioned and it seems as if the Daily Planet doesn't mind if Clark Kent goes to his high school reunion and then takes the next few weeks off work. With all the plot devices removed I was actually interested in where this movie would take me rather than rolling my eyes before the film has even begun.First and foremost the film opens better than any other of th0e Reeve Supermans. First Superman saves a man from drowning in his car wait till you see it! and shortly after there is a fire at a chemical factory and superman arrives again to save the day. I felt that this opening was rather thrilling and the film makers stuck to the traditions of classic Superman.Then we move onto the story of Clark Kent rekindling a romance with a high school sweetheart who is at the same time fending off an old alcoholic exboyfriend. This scenario gives rise to a number of funny scenes the one at the bowling alley was side splitting. As per usual Reeves played the part of the bumbling geeky Clark Kent to perfection.Running along side is the story of Richard Prior. He's an unemployed bum scenes in the welfare office are hysterical who suddenly finds that he has a knack for computers. He commits a fraud using his extensive knowledge of computers the fraud is later repeated  with acknowledgment  in the brilliant film Office Space and when he is caught he assumes that he will be fired and arrested. However his sinister boss has something else in mind for our comic computer whiz.However their plans are thwarted by Superman and in response Prior and his boss obtain kryptonite. However the kryptonite is 'not quite right' and causes superman to become evil rather than weaken him. In any case superman is out of the way which allows Prior and his boss go to work on a super computer that can control the world. Will Superman become good again and save the day in time? All in all a very enjoyable film even though there are short comings. The performances are very good and I couldn't imagine the computer whiz's part being played by anyone other than Prior. The villain was also terrific as was his sister and coconspirator.Yes  this does stray from the traditional Superman plot formulars. But it did so without dishonouring the Superman tradition if that makes sense. And besides it's good to have a different villain than Lex Luthor and a break from the irritatingly unresolvable romance between KentSuperman and Lois Lane.In closing I found it rather amusing that the traditionalists put this effort down but when the Reeve's series returned to it's old plot formulars Luthor Daily Planet Lane... in the woeful Superman IV  The Quest For Peace the critics traditionalists and general audiences all gave it a giant thumbs down!However the film did lose a star for having this bizarre leftwing aftertaste. Instead of a crazed criminal seeking world domination the villain is a corporate boss who wants control of the coffee market and quotes Atilla the Hun. He is enraged by and destroys a small South American country that thinks it can dictate terms to the free market. Clark Kent's high school crush is now a perfect single mother  see it's perfectly OK if Hollywood says so and the film opens with poor old lovable Richard Pryor getting booted off welfare. Ironically the villain goes for the oil towards the end of the film. But alas Superman saved the day by ridding the world of this capitalist threat. Almost as laughable as the politically neutral truth justice and .... all that stuff in the recent Superman Returns. Get over it.".

	schema:reviewBody "After two successful films the Superman franchise was unable to sustain momentum with Superman III. Superman III continues the series slide that was slightly evident in the otherwise solid Superman II from a mix of drama action and sly selfreferential humor to more slapstick oriented silly entries. Superman III almost wants to just be a comedy and the film's dramatic elements are fairly lacking.As Superman III opens Clark Kent Christopher Reeve is headed for a high school reunion in Smallville where he crosses paths with an old crush of his Lana Lang Annette O'Toole who years later would essay the role of Martha Kent in the series Smallville who is divorced and living in Smallville with her son Ricky Paul Kaethler. Clark rediscovers his attraction to her and they begin what seems to be the road to a relationship. At the same time Gus Gorman Richard Pryor an unemployed man who discovers he has a knack for computer programming gets a job with Webscoe Industries and performs some hacking to inflate his paycheck. The company's head Ross Webster Robert Vaughan discovers Gus' creative accounting but instead of firing him decides to use his abilities to attempt to take control of the world's energy supplies. When Superman thwarts' Ross' plans he has Gus use satellites to analyze the location of Krypton and determine the elements that make up Kryptonite Superman's weakness and plans to synthesize a version of it.Gus is unable to replicate all the elements and substitutes tar was the missing item which produces Kryptonite that doesn't kill Superman but instead alters his personality causing him to be come evil and selfish. With Superman no longer helping people Ross' plans go forward and Gus makes a request he has designed a supercomputer that he wants Ross to build for him that will allow him to control all the computers in the world.With the presence of Richard Pryor it is unsurprising that Superman III has a more strictly comedy directed bent but frankly turning the Superman series into a much more campy variety of film just doesn't work. After the first two films were able to be somewhat tongue in cheek without losing their dramatic strength Superman III doesn't even really try to match those films. Almost everything in Superman III is played for laughs and not even good laughs. A majority of the humor falls flat and the whole experience proves relatively lame.A significant loss is the virtual removal of Lois Lane Margot Kidder from the film. She makes a brief appearance at the very beginning of the film and the very end but is missing from the rest. She had a disagreement with the producers over the firing of Superman director Richard Donner on Superman II and so they all but removed her from Superman III. In her place they introduced Lana Lang and Annette O'Toole is capable in the role but the ClarkLana relationship doesn't have the chemistry of the ClarkLois relationship in Superman and Superman II.Superman III also suffers from lackluster villains. Ross Webster is a rather bland adversary with Robert Vaughan attempting to channel Gene Hackman but coming up a bit short. His performance isn't terrible but it's not great either. Gus Gorman isn't a villain per se more of a misguided soul so the film somewhat vacillates between making him a bad guy and thus sucks any possible menace from him. That plus he is portrayed by Richard Pryor who is a capable comedian but has absolutely no ability to play a villain. He's just too nice a guy.About the only places Superman III still hits are with the still solid performance of Christopher Reeve as Superman who manages to mostly escape unscathed and the film's visual effects are still up to par. Otherwise Superman III under whelms on almost every level. Not so Super indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arriving nearly three years after Superman II Superman III was completed without any of the infighting or backstage fuss that had hampered the release of its predecessor. There have been some signficant changes. Lois Lane Margot Kidder features very little in the movie and Lex Luthor Gene Hackman doesn't feature at all. The storyline formula is virtually the same is the first two but the film contains far too much of the sort of slapstick comedy that underscored and nearly undermined the previous efforts.The film opens with a ridiculous slapstick credits sequence that finishes with Superman Christopher Reeve rescuing a man who nearly drowns in his own car. Elsewhere unemployed nohoper Gus Gorman Richard Pryor signs up to train as a computer programmer and finds himself to be something of a genius at it. Before too long he comes to the attentions of magnate Ross Webster Robert Vaughn who intends to use Gorman's talents to help him amass a fortune from coffee and oil. Unfortunately Superman scuppers their plans prompting Webster and Gorman to try and put him out of action...The usual superheroics ensure. Superman comes to the aid of a burning chemical plant an imperilled coffee crop before a final showdown with a deadly Supercomputer. Away from all the flying around in his secret identity of Clark Kent Superman reacquaints himself with an old high school flame Lana Lang an appealing Annette O'Toole and her young son Ricky Paul Kaethler.In an interesting twist the villains acquire some Kryptonite the only substance to which Superman is vulnerable. Exposed to it our hero turns into a drunken lout before splitting himself into two personas one good and one evil who duel it out for dominance in a fantastic scrapyardbound fistfight.Superman III works best when it's being played straight especially in the gentler moments between Clark and Lana Lang. However too much of the film depends on unfunny overplayed comedy. The main culprit in this is Richard Pryor as far too many scenes function as setups for his strained and overthetop standup routines.Robert Vaughn gives a good performance as Webster but like Lex Luthor before him is neither sufficiently threatening or imposing as the main villain. Annie Ross and Pamela Stephenson as his sister and mistress respectively are ineffectual and unappealing sidekicks.Keeping his head through all of this is Christopher Reeve as the eponymous superhero. He really enjoys going bad in this film and otherwise maintains a consistent and credible performance.An enjoyable flick but for the excessive comedy. The series would eventually be killed off with the anodyne Superman IV The Quest For Peace.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superman III isn't as good as Superman I or II but there is still an epic inside waiting to get out. It's better than Superman Returns and far better than Superman IV. So why does it get such a bad rap? The answer is Richard Pryor a weird robot slapstick comedy and the absence of Gene Hackman. I wouldn't be bothered by Pryor's acting if he was actually funny! But there are still some elements that make this movie great. Like the bad Superman fighting against the good Clark Kent Clark going back home to Smallville Clark's relationship with Lana Superman saving people from a fire the best special effects in the series and a fight against a supercomputer that can read Superman's weaknesses. Fans of the comic also don't like this movie because it doesn't really use the source material for villains. But if you look hard enough you will find that they are just different interpretations. Ross Webster is the Corporate Lex Luthor not the underground criminal Gene Hackman portrayed Evil Superman is a form of Bizarro and the supercomputer is like Braniac.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superman III 1983 is criminally and the most underrated Superman film of all time. It is a good solid excellent sequel doesn't deserve the hate. Are you a fan of Superman III? Hell yes I am a fan of Superman III and a big supporter of the film. It was released the year I was born 1983. I love love love this film to death. I enjoy and love the third entry of Superman the same as the original first Superman in the franchise. Christopher Reeve is the only Clark KentSuperman no one else. Great Special effects the best in the franchise. Clark Kent VS evil Superman was the best of the film and the best fight in the intier franchise. I especially liked the battle that Superman had with his good  bad selves in the junkyard. The cyborg on the end Vera Annie Ross in which she was caught with weirs from the computer creped me out and scared me. I think it is much better than Superman IV The Quest for Peace Superman Returns Man of Steel Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice and Justice League. Superman 3 is my second personal favorite film in the franchise it defines my childhood. Christopher Reeve is Superman of all time. Superman The Movie is my number 1 favorite Superman. Christopher Reeve is Superman of all time. He is Clark KentSuperman no one else. I enjoy this movie more I watch it on VHS tape the first time as a kid. This movie is slapstick comedy from Richard Pryor but I didn't mind him the film it is not that bad folks it never was. This was the first movie in the franchise I watched as a kid. Superman II introduced me in to world of Superman and Superheroes but this movie was this film of all 4 I watched first was Superman III. Here is why I enjoy it and I think it is an pair with the first original filmThe story follows right there in which we saw teen Clark Kent Jeff East from Superman the Movie in the opening sequence in Smallville we saw Lana Lang played by Diane Sherry Case and Clark's nemesis Brad Wilson played by Brad Flock this movie is set right 15 years after Clark graduate from high school and he returns to Smallville and he sees his old first love Lana Lang played now by Annette O'Toole. Brad Wilson is now played by Gavan O'Herlihy. The movie right connects this film and loyalty follows the roots from the first film.This movie is completely connection with Smallville TV series 2001 Annette O'Toole played Martha Kent in the series that is why I have enjoy this film so much.This is the first movie in which there was no Lex Luther and it was new villain Ross Webster Robert Vaughn and yes he was good. His sister Vera Annie Ross and his girlfriend Lorelei Pamela Stephenson were a good villains. Lex Luthor was in all Superman films except Man of Steel and Superman III. I like that the story is fresh and doesn't copy the first two films. Christopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark KentSuperman like Christopher Reeve If anyone could be Superman It is Christopher Reeve! Yes I am Christopher Reeve fan boy so sue me. You really believe Christopher was superman he was so iconic!Annette O'Toole is the best female leading romantic lead that Superman ever had in the film. I like Margot Kidder as Lois Lane but I love Lana Lang much more that is my personal opinion.Richard Pryor is Gus Gorman and he really did a good job portraying his character. Superman powers in action in this movie super hearing from comic book alive and his xray vision on Jimmy is the best of the film. In the opening scene Superman saves a man in the car from drowning. Superman saves a chemical plant from fire containing vials of acid that can produce clouds of corrosive vapor when superheated. He freeze lake and he takes it too the plant and let go so that it starts raining he saves Plant and Smallville from chemical cloud. Superman save's Ricky Paul Kaethler Lana's son in the corn filed from the tractor that scene was really serious the kid could have been seriously crushed it that could have happened in real life. I enjoy that it was a disaster film on the end in which Ross Webster and Gus Gorman builds a super computer in which it steals the electricity and power from Metropolis I love in which Gus Gorman redeems him self and saves Superman twice. I love in which Brad fights with Clark and Clark throws from the bed in the elevator funny scene. John Williams did return with his music score for superman and it was awesome as always. Richard Lester directed perfectly this film so I disagree about him not giving 100 of the film I think his vision on Superman III was great. I would give it 10 but absence from Margot Kidder as Lois Lane was a bad idea she should have been more in the movie but she only had two scenes in the opening sequence and in the ending sequence. That shouldn't have been in the film so it is a 9 a perfect good score. 810 I love this film to death and it is my second favorite and the last good Superman film. It is my personal second favorite film of all time I love it.".

The daftness of the plot and shallowness of many of the characters combined with a significant number of poorlyexecuted effects shots produces an end result so awful that you can spend two very enjoyable hours just laughing at how bad it is.Superman the Movie begins on an epic note and maintains a degree of gravitas throughout  but this second sequel starts off with a ridiculous piece of slapstick mayhem and never really tries to be serious at all. Many films try to get their audience emotionally invested in what's happening during the finale whereas this one if anything saves the daftest for last.Superman III also suffers from the fact that many of the main characters from the first two films are either absent or reduced to minor parts and most of the story focuses on people who weren't there in the previous instalments which makes this feel less like a continuation of the existing story and more like a completely separate entity which just happens to feature the same actor as Superman.I gave it 1 star for its few decent bits of acting and characterisation yes there are one or two 1 for some halfdecent set designs and 1 for being amusing. It loses the other 7 for throwing away most of what it inherited from its two predecessors and reducing the series to a cheap cheesy comedy.This film can be enjoyed if you don't expect too much of it  it's best watched with your brain completely disengaged.".

Having heard both from people who loved the movie and hated the movie I watched it with an open mind but in the end it was clear to me that this movie is weak. Very weak.Half of the movie revolves around Gus Gorman Richard Pryor! a dimwitted computer programmer who becomes involved in crime when he begins working for millionaire Ross Webster Robert Vaughn. The other half of the film revolves around Superman Christopher Reeve as he is reunited with high school sweetheart Lana Lang Annette O'Toole and becomes evil when exposed to synthetic kryptonite.One can't help but wonder what David and Leslie Newman who cowrote the previous two SUPERMAN films were thinking when they wrote this film. It opens with a cringeworthy slapstick sequence and gets worse from there. Any and all scenes involving Richard Pryor are completely out of place in this film making it seem more like an unfunny comedy than a superhero film. Director Richard Lester tries his best to make the movie work but ultimately it doesn't thanks in part to the absence of Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and the nearabsence of Margot Kidder as Lois Lane Kidder has a total of about three minutes onscreen. Christopher Reeve however is excellent as always and Annette O'Toole is a good fit for the part of Lana Lang interestingly she portrayed Clark's mother Martha Kent on the hit Superman TV series SMALLVILLE.SUPERMAN III is mediocre at best a failed attempt to continue an excellent series. While it couldn't hold my attention for the 125 minute runtime I can think of worse movies to watch late at night with a bowl of popcorn and a Coke. Superman fans may want to check it out all others steer clear.".

It falls somewhere under fair for me as the effects continue to be awesome but the story this time is tremendously lacking.  Part two had three villians equally as strong as Superman plus the romance going with Lois Lane.  This one has a Lex Luthor clone Hackman's Lex is left offscreen in jail who also would like to rule the world a dweeby computer genius Pryor as the much debated addition to the cast and a romance you know will go nowhere with one of Reeve's lost loves.  We already saw that he couldn't give things up for Lois so why bother brining on a new girl? Though O' Toole is gorgeous a lot more than Kidder who is featured at the beginning of the film looking aged then at the end with a bad tan.  Rumor has it she outpriced herself which resulted in the character being shipped off to Bermuda.  With her out of the picture Reeve attends a high school reunion where he bumps into O'Toole.  Meantime Vaughn and Pryor are poised for world dominance though Pryor is realizing the ramifications and is reluctant.  But he still goes through it concocting a kryptonite like impairment for Superman which results in some of the film's best scenes. Reeve develops a naughty alter ego and we get to see Superbadman get drunk straighten the Tower of Pisa even get horny  among other things. There's a terrific showdown between Reeve and...well Reeve in a junkyard where bad Supes confronts his inner goodness Clark Kent.  After this though the film sags to it's conclusion as Reeve goes up against more rockets and missiles a la part one.  Despite missing the tension of part two the film is interesting in a disjointed kind of way.  The flying effects are once again topnotch and strangely enough are better than in the next film which came out four years later!  And most have mentioned the dopey opening sequence that belonged more in a silent comedy than here but it wasn't a horrendous mistake.  I must note as a kid that when Vaughn's sister is turned into that psychorobot it FREAKED me out!  Biggest annoyance is the kid who plays Ricky his voice is badly dubbed and incredibly nerveracking.  Also could've done without O'Herlihy's drunken antagonist.  Most of the music is lifted from part two but since I liked Ken Thorne's work I didn't mind.  I could even say Supe fans will kill me I would rather watch this one than the first movie.  So even though the story isn't really there like in the previous films the movie overall still FLIES hehe.".

I also liked that drunk caretaker at that Webscoe Centere when Gus got him drunk! I also like it when Gus says Baby it's daddy to the big computer in that cave. I thought that the fight that those two Superman's had in the scrap yard was a lesson to everyone that is. Good will triumph over evil in the end! this film also shows us just how dependent we are on oil! and coffee to get us going in the mornings and for this world to function. I wish that Clark Kent would get some better glasses maybe he should visit Specsaves!! I am glad we have superman on this planet I sleep much safer in my bed knowing that he is out there.

The junkyard fight scene the best superhero movie fight sequence ever outside the Matrix trilogy. 3. When Clark becomes Superman again after that fight scene the way he stands up realises who he is and then rips his shirt open to reveal the clean fresh heroic S symbol is awesome and is one of the most stirring and effective Superman moments ever. 4. Best special effects of the series. 5. Richard Pryor IS funny even though he is clearly in the wrong flick. 6. That nasty ZeldafromTerrahawks cyborg monster that woman gets turned into at the end  SCARY! 7. Lana Lang is so much better than Lois Lane you can actually see why Clark would go for her. 8. The way Superman outwits the computer at the climax rather than just using his power to defeat it. Here's the ultimate cool thing when most actors play evil versions of their characters they just play them as 2D bad guys. But Reeve makes the evil Superman a convincingly bitter currupted version of the Man of Steel who realises how great he used to be and hates himself and everybody else for his fall from grace. He's a disgraced hero a fallen angel. Ironically he's the best villain of teh Superman series. The whole goodevil Superman thing is awesome and for me makes Superman III a very good film. I'll take Superman III over SpiderMan Daredevil and Batman Forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "In truth although I personally enjoyed Superman III and I scored it an 8 it probably lies somewhere closer to 7.5. What has become the major criticism has been a focus not on what the film was but what it could have been. This is truly unfair to the finished product as SUPERMAN III did have a lot to offer and remains quite entertaining today. Please read on as I qualify a statement that may be viewed a blasphemous among many fans.First let's get something straight. The film was not a bomb. It made less than the first 2 however part II made less than part I and yet is considered a strong film whatever cut of it you see. Part III made less but was still very successful. Second part III is attacked for 2 reasons. The first is of course the lack of DONNER and his influences director Richard Donner of the first film and part of the second. Yes it is indeed sad that we will never know how far he could taken the series had he not been so unceremoniously canned however that is something we cannot change or know and Part III is it's own animal and should be judged thusly. True it does suffer some major drawbacks. There is real lack of spark without Lois around and the humor is very overpowering in many spots the opening for example is entertaining but completely off tone for the franchise. It does however benefit from a wonderful Lana Lang the still very beautiful and active Superman actress in the current Smallville series Annette O'Toole a fun and unpredictable battle with a supercomputer the ever reliable Reeve as Superman once again and a scene which should be considered one of the greatest scenes in ANY superhero film good Supes vs. Bad. That scene alone warrants a viewing.The second complaint is with costar Richard Pryor. Anyone who has seen BATMAN and Nicholson's dominance of screen time or even the first SUPERMAN must acknowledge that SUPERMAN III is not the only film to focus at least as much on the villain if not more so as they do the hero. It is sometimes distracting the extent they focus on Pryor in the film but he also brings both a lightly villainous but also strong sense of humanity to a part that could have simply have been just a forgettable henchman. There was a distinct overuse of his character but he by no means sinks the film. It should also be pointed out that the first 2 films I rank as do many others as some of the best Superhero films ever made also had their flaws both in continuity if Krypton had been destroyed thousands of years earlier how then does the education in the crystals on the way to Earth reference 20th Century information for example and logic so it's just mere coincidence that tossing a nuclear bombmissile into the vastness of space would just happen to explode a phantom zone prison floating around from Kyrpton? and even Donner's work was occasionally improved by the choices made by Lester his contributions to the franchise are a real injustice on their own as he is also an immensely talented filmmaker. Of course the third is no where near the shear wonder of parts 1 and 2 but it does stand well on it's own as a side adventure outside the first two films' mythology and despite it's shortcomings features some truly memorable effects action and of course legendary Christopher Reeve playing not just dual but a trio of roles. Worth a watch for sure.".

The new love interest in this film is Lana Lang Clark's childhood sweetheart. Whereas the first movie was a great mix of action drama and humour this movie is mostly humour and a little action because this movie is mainly meant to show off Richard Pryor's comedy skills. The plot in general is a little weak and the villain in this is no Lex Luthor.The acting is especially weak. Christopher Reeve doesn't do such a great job as the man of steel in this entry. It seems he's getting bored. Of course Richard Pryor completely ruins the mood of the movie with his over the top acting.Overall this movie is a joke not really meant to be anything otherwise and I suggest people just ignore parts III and IV and skip right on to Superman Returns.410".

	schema:headline " Historical often more interesting than entertaining often muddled but exciting";
	schema:reviewBody "Straight Shooting is of historical interest for many reasons including the grouping of Harry Carey Hoot Gibson and John Ford.Even this early in his career Ford knew how to frame a shot and many a beautiful shot here involved framing in doorways and windows.Carey's character seemed often modeled on those so frequently portrayed by William S. Hart whom Carey in some ways copied both were Easterners who wanted to be Westerners and both beautifully presented to us a picture of the rugged and basically decent character we want to think of as the essential Westerner.Hoot Gibson was about 25 here but looked younger. He never was especially goodlooking but he was always in every movie I've seen him in likable and always one of the greatest of cowboys. At this stage he'd been in pictures for about seven years.Providing the love interest but also much more was a lovely young lady  though at age 29 not so young as the part she played  who frequently reminded me of the wonderful Mae Marsh. She seems to be relatively unknown although she has 88 credits here at IMDb all in silent films.So yes there is motion picture history here the early years of some movie icons a foreshadowing of some great careers but the editing ... oy.Many early movies suffered from some scenes frequently static that seemed to run on and on and on. Even D.W. Griffith allowed some pointless nonmoving shots to just hang for no apparent reason.Here we have the exact opposite problem. Probably because of sloppy editing far too many scenes or angles are just cut off. It's hard to tell who is doing what to whom and why. Even in the middle of the big battle people aim others fall and it is confusing as to who is who and whether we should care bad guys or good guys?Yet some other scenes of Cheyenne Harry just staring do go on and on a fairly amateurish effort at showing the character pondering ... and pondering ... and pondering. By no means just once.Perhaps too at least part of the problem is the version presented at YouTube. Though official run time is listed as 57 minutes the version I saw is 2 hours and 13 minutes! For whoknowswhatreason after The End the middle of the movie starts again! Frankly at YouTube many a movie is uploaded by a liar or an incompetent or both! And there seems to be no way to get YouTube to call down the offender.Straight Shooting is a movie every Western fan every John Ford fan every Harry Carey fan every Hoot Gibson fan  and each of those includes me  should watch if only for the chance to see the early years of their film work.More than that though it is a good story with good characterizations and so intriguing in the directing.There is a lot of evidence of D.W. Griffith influence and at least one shot seems directly taken from The Birth of a Nation. But Straight Shooting is generally exciting as well as interesting and very definitely worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Ford and Carey near their best!";
	schema:reviewBody "The fifth film in Harry Carey's Cheyenne Harry series and the first of feature length namely 5 reels this was also the third in the series to be directed by John Jack Ford. Already actor Carey had established the persona that he would interpret for the rest of his career. He was still playing similar lead roles in the 1940s most particularly in Henry Hathaway's Shepherd of the Hills 1941. When he made Straight Shooting Carey was 39 years old. Pleasingly he acts his age and no attempt is made to disguise this fact. If anything he actually looks a bit older. Typically the romantic subplot centers around Carey's age. Will he marry a girl less than half his age? Actually Molly Malone was 29 when this film was made but she looks 18 at the very most. Straight Shooting was director Ford's first feature film. He had previously directed three tworeelers and one threereeler. Ford is not feeling his way here. He obviously already knows what he wants to achieve and how to obtain these results. Straight Shooting is a sophisticated movie centering on the Cheyenne Harry character and Ford is not afraid to paint his hero in less than glowing terms. The movie is full of scenes and choices which stay in the memory. Even when you see the movie and are familiar with the choices the characters make you want to see the action unfold again and again. Available on a watchable Alpha DVD.".

The print I saw was missing some brief footage and the film isn't in the best shape. Still it is clearly unimpressive. There are plenty of shots with open doorways and one might find similarities with Ford's later work but the static camera positioning is prosaic even for 1917.Harry Carey's Cheyenne Harry is a bandit turned good after seeing an attractive femalea role too similar to the one William S. Hart had already introduced to the screen in nearly every one of his vehicles. And the climax of Straight Shooting seems to be taken straight from D.W. Griffith it especially resembles The Birth of a Nation in a clumsy derivative way. Eventually Ford would improve upon past films and filmmaking but here he was just copying others.".

	schema:reviewBody "Along with The Virginian and William S. Hart's gritty West depictions Straight Shooting seemed to herald in a more realistic approach to the sage brush drama and was justly praised by critics of the day.John Ford billed as Jack brutally showed a bitter clash between cattlemen and homesteaders and Harry Carey put his stamp on the role of Cheyenne Harry initially hired by the ranchers but after seeing the tragic and senseless death of a young homesteader joins farmer Sweet Water Sims. As well as Harry Carey a young Hoot Gibson was also promoted to featured player status on the strength of his role as Sam a young cowboy again employed by the ranchers but who is in love with pretty Joan Sims.There are some stunning sequences  when Thunder Flint is introduced there is a beautiful tracking shot showing horses grazing on a hill which was to become a Ford signature piece and also the rain. It never seems to rain in westerns but it does in this one and seeing the tethered horses being drenched by rain as well as the cowboys larking about in the mud just adds to the realism.The boy's funeral affects Harry immensely and he then vows to reform and work for the good. He has to get the ranchers before they get him  which they plan for that night. There is also a gunfight high noon style between Harry and the man hired to track him down and who incidentally was the same coward who gunned down Joan's brother!! And in another interesting twist for 1917 Harry fights fire with fire by recruiting his old gang of cutthroats  the Black Eyed Gang!! Interesting actress Molly Malone  she looks such a kid but even though she made her film debut only the year before in 1916 she was really a late bloomer having been born in 1888. Being almost 30 at a time when most of the young actress were barely out of their teens was no barrier and she went on to have a lengthy career.".

A large battle ensues and...............................Harry is then faced with a dilemma. Does he get Joan to mend that tear in his shirt or does he ride on? Many of Ford's future trademarks are in this film. He always liked plenty of hard ridin' horsemen complete with horse falls with plenty of action. Long panoramic shots such as the shot of a cattle drive from the top of a hill impress. Lots of gun play a sympathetic goodbad hero and a little romance thrown in. The trademark Fordian humor would come later. By the way what happened to the price on Harry's head?A good start to a long and rewarding career.".
