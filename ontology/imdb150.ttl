The score is great which is typical for a Woody Allen film. Allen does these little films vey well and they are almost always worth watching.  Sean Penn plays a selfcentered egotistical creep with talent. I will leave any further interpretations regarding the preceding statement to the Gentle Reader.

I must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did themselves. That showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry but by a sort of genius and inspiration they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things but do not understand the meaning of them.  Socrates The ApologySo here we have Woody telling a story about a storyteller who talks and struts endlessly Penn has a ball with this but can only say anything through music and he can't explain a bit of it. Much like Woody who prattles on about every neurosis but speaks volumes through his control of the medium. It's just something he's born to do.And this is the only way to understand Django  with only two working fingers on his fretting hand accidental disfigurement he reinvented the whole medium of guitar. The new shape of his hand forced him into holding octaves  which can be done on guitar with two adjacent fingers unlike on the piano  and changing the way leads and comping  here selfaccompaniment  were played. His art was the necessary step before Les Paul and thence to Wes Montgomery and so on to you and me.

	schema:reviewBody "Sean Penn plays Emmett Ray a littleknown jazz guitarist an eccentric egocentric genius selfproclaimed as the greatest guitar player in the country or the second greatest guitar player in the world  because of that gypsy from France the bane of his life Django Reinhardt. The story of Sweet and Lowdown is the story of Emmett and the girl he first describes as the little one with the silly hat who is also incidentally called Hattie. There is something so special and memorable about the chemistry between Hattie and Emmett. Hattie is perfect for Emmett because she's mute and therefore he can sound off all day about how great he is and she's the one person who won't contradict him.Woody has the knack of making highly watchable movies  and popping them out one a year. There is a continuity across them all yet they all seem somewhat unique. Sweet and Lowdown stands heads and shoulders above every other film Woody has made since Husbands and Wives. With Sweet and Lowdown Woody reminds us why we loved him in the first place  yet i'm not sure i can think of another Woody film that's as genuine beautiful and moving yet eccentric and funny at the same time. Annie Hall was probably as touching but with Woody is no actor next to Penn which i think makes an incredible difference! Penn brings to life a character so eccentric and unbelievable yet we never doubt him we never feel he's not a total human being.Penn's performance is counterbalanced by another equally moving performance by Samantha Morton as Hattie. Often you'll find yourself watching a twoshot with the both of them on screen and you won't be able to decide which character you're more curious to watch. More often than not you'll watch Samantha Morton to see what Hattie is thinking and feeling. An extraordinary job by an extraordinarily talented actress you may have seen as the mother in In America or the precog Agatha in Minority report.The one fault in the film is Uma Thurman  she is badly miscast and clearly only suited to intentionally hammy fodder like Kill Bill. Her character Blanche is great Okay so i slept with him but i was just researching a book! which makes it more the shame that Thurman speaks her line like she thinks this is a cartoon or a Tarantino movie. The audience will only accept the eccentricity of this style if the performances are genuine she gets an F. She pops the bubble of this movie. When she appears we suddenly realise its only a movie and the spell is broken. Nevertheless she's only in a relatively small portion of the film and she can't bring down the rest of it. Sweet and Lowdown has the feeling of telling you a tale and it spins some great fun yarns about littleknown jazz guitarist Emmett Ray. Penn and Morton bring to life an incredible couple of characters  two of Woody's best creations. Well designed with nice period costumes and well directed especially the magestic final crane shot a reference to La Strada i believe. The story is beautifully punctuated with scintillating jazz music by Dick Hyman and others.Come listen Emmett tells someone at one point you'll love this i'm great.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sweet and Lowdown is the story of a fictional jazz guitarist who is self admittedly the second best in the worldnext to that gypsy in France but there is one thing that is clear while watching this movie sean penn is second to no one. He is simply the greatest actor of our time and he once again proves it here. As emmett Ray sean penn invests his very soul and embodies the role of a vain talented yet oblivious and cold hearted man who is actually filled with self doubt and remorse. The character is as crude a low life thief and pimp as he is a excellent musician. He is the zany pathetic artist with a heart of stone. That penn can make you feel for him is no easy task. Penn also did an exceptional job mastering the appearance of playing the guitar for the role. Woody Allen has crafted a gem of a film filled with poignancy and humor. Samantha Morton is incredible as Hattie the mute girl who clearly worships everything about Ray though Ray doesn't have the ability to notice a good thing when it's standing in front of his self absorbed face. That Ray is both a genius and a fool is clear and it's the emotional core of the film. He's just as at home shooting rats at the train tracks as he is performing drunk for his adoring audience. At the end of the movie there is a series of scenes in which the emotional weight of Rays mistakes seem to finally be understood by him. In one he meets Hattie again on the same boardwalk where they originally met though she is now happily married and a mother. The false bravado of Rays personality seems to crack momentarily only to be swallowed again by his deluded machismo. The second even more heart wrenching is the final scene at the railroad with Gretchen Mol. Penn in an ill fated attempt to show off his skills for her seems to have all of his regrets conceits and pain hit him at once. Watching Penn slowly remove the mask of Rays lonely broken heart is a gift in an acting class of it's own. He is truly the master of American acting. Who won best actor in 2000? Russell Crowe in gladiator? And we wonder why penn doesn't believe in acting awards.".

	schema:reviewBody "As Woody Allen said of Sean Penn after working with him on this film Sean's a tremendous actor. And he displays his tremendous talent in playing the role of Emmett Ray jazz guitarist a genius at his craft rather a disastrous dope in all other aspects of his life.Then there's Samantha Morton who is brilliant in her portrayal of sweet adorable Hattie a cute mute young woman whose simple needs and wants along with her lack of narcissism and inability to spew out mind numbing volumes of bullst banter obscure her deep strength and savvy intelligence. Those that value pure sweet unassuming kindness will find her irresistibly lovable.Emmett only really knows one thing how to play guitar like no one else in the world with the exception of the one person he idolizes to the point of hysteria Django Reinhardt. He's obliviously inept at just about everything else in his life especially his feelings to the point where he doesn't know real rare wonderful love when it's right next to him. Sean is able to make Emmett so very likable even in his worst of behavior. He excels at what he does best bringing real human depth and qualities to his craft that exceptionally few actors are or have been capable of doing.This film is much like the character of Hattie deceptive in its initial appearance and of a substantially better quality than you may first think. It seems like a light cute little story largely due to its entertaining presentation and lack of dramatic pretense but there is significant texture and reality to this work of art. Emmett is perhaps the greatest guitar player in America and has so many of the essential ingredients for huge success drive ambition presentation wardrobe personality yet he tends to sabotage himself frequently and never gets the lucky break needed to put him at the top. True he could probably do rather well if he didn't pss away such volumes of cash but he never gets the type of success that the best supposedly deserve and is so wrought with money it won't disappear in the most extravagant lifestyles.Emmett also makes the tragically universal mistake of believing bullsht both his and society's. He thinks the money and possessions and trophy girlfriends are what happiness are all about. His one saving grace is his love and respect for his craft but can this alone keep him from making a disaster of his life? He discovers all too painfully that the beautiful woman with the sophisticated witty repartee whom all the other men drool over has an extremely high price tag of impenetrable cold blooded narcissism. And though Emmett acts for the most part like a shallow dope trying to hide and deny that besides being a genius he is a painfully sensitive man in desperate need of sweet nurturing love he still makes way too many foolhardy decisions. He is blind to the fact that the women who use sweetness merely as a tool of manipulation are the last thing he or anyone else with a shred of decency need or deserve.This is a great film and story and you can also enjoy a very pretty picture of life in the 1940's while you watch it.Apparently there was an obscure jazz guitarist named Emmett Ray but even if there wasn't this is not really a fictionalized account. Certainly not in the sense of capturing the essence of character love and genius. As he has done so marvelously before and since Woody Allen masterfully captures an immensely watchable slice of life that most of us will only have an opportunity to witness with this fine offering. For the film itself as well as the two stellar leads this is will go into my relatively short list of wonderful favorite films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Help!  Call the Police!  911!  One of the greatest injustices is currently happening RIGHT NOW!  And it all has to do with Woody Allen.  Yes apparently no matter how good the movie is the critics and the general public are forced to say that woody allen isn't good any more!  What a disgrace!  Sure he's not making annie halls anymore but he's certainly not making any terribly horrible movies like people say he is.  Ladies and Gentleman please save those comments for when joel schumacher directs Annie Hall 2 with a vengence.Sweet and Lowdown is an independent film that received an amusing reaction from critics.  Wow!  Woody Allen made an art flick!  BFD i say.  Some critics loved it others seemingly dismissed it.  I think it's a great flick and excellent character study.It's imdb we know the plot let's hit the acting paragraph shall we? Jeff Spicoli a decent actor shines as the lead which i can almost guarantee you could not be played by any other actor.  he lets us know that he hates himself his talents his habits his personality flaws and even those he loves.  Penn was nominated for his role but lost to kevin spacey for his role in american beauty which was simply a better film but each man gave an equally stunning performance.  Samatha Morton was the one who received the random nomination at the 1999 academy awards.  Not to say she was bad she was great in fact.  She loves emmet despite his flaws and in some ways relates to his struggle and offers him her undivided attention and sympathy.  Great performance but if you think the academy actually cared then you're a bit mixed up my friend.Sweet and Lowdown is an exceptionally good film that i highly suggest you go out and rent don't worry they'll have it.  A great character study this film proves that ol' Woody is not ready to go yet and definetely deserved the standing ovation he received at the 2002 AA's I was hoping that it would happen and was shocked that it did.  So here's to you Woody.  Go back to your apartment turn on the tube and get out a cold one.  Maybe cook yourself lobsters with your girlfriend or order an italian sub with mayonaisse.".

Yes apparently no matter how good the movie is the critics and the general public are forced to say that woody allen isn't good any more!  What a disgrace!  Sure he's not making annie halls anymore but he's certainly not making any terribly horrible movies like people say he is.  Ladies and Gentleman please save those comments for when joel schumacher directs Annie Hall 2 with a vengence.Sweet and Lowdown is an independent film that received an amusing reaction from critics.  Wow!  Woody Allen made an art flick!  BFD i say.  Some critics loved it others seemingly dismissed it.  I think it's a great flick and excellent character study.It's imdb we know the plot let's hit the acting paragraph shall we? Jeff Spicoli a decent actor shines as the lead which i can almost guarantee you could not be played by any other actor.  he lets us know that he hates himself his talents his habits his personality flaws and even those he loves.  Penn was nominated for his role but lost to kevin spacey for his role in american beauty which was simply a better film but each man gave an equally stunning performance.  Samatha Morton was the one who received the random nomination at the 1999 academy awards.  Not to say she was bad she was great in fact.  She loves emmet despite his flaws and in some ways relates to his struggle and offers him her undivided attention and sympathy.  Great performance but if you think the academy actually cared then you're a bit mixed up my friend.Sweet and Lowdown is an exceptionally good film that i highly suggest you go out and rent don't worry they'll have it.  A great character study this film proves that ol' Woody is not ready to go yet and definetely deserved the standing ovation he received at the 2002 AA's I was hoping that it would happen and was shocked that it did.  So here's to you Woody.  Go back to your apartment turn on the tube and get out a cold one.  Maybe cook yourself lobsters with your girlfriend or order an italian sub with mayonaisse.";

	schema:reviewBody "It seems like ages since the last time I watched a decent movie by Woody Allen. Let's see from Annie Hall 1977 to Everyone Says I Love You 1996 things were good. Then Deconstructing Harry 1997 Celebrity 1998 Small Time Crooks 2000 The Curse of the Jade Scorpion 2001 Hollywood Ending 2002 and Melinda and Melinda 2004 ALL had problems sometimes more than their good points. In the middle of both phases is where Sweet and Lowdown exists. Now this is a good movie on all the levels.Why Emmet Ray couldn't be Django Reinhardt ? It's simple. He isn't that bold when it comes to express his feelings. So that's why he didn't tell the girl he loved who loved him as well that he loves her and lost her at the end. I think there is a reason why Allen did a movie about that man else paying a tribute to jazz guitarist he loves. Allen is the complete opposite of Emmet Ray. Dear Woody just can't get enough of showing himself to the audience through the characters of his movies during the last 35 years some of them played by him. Or maybe after all of these years Woody just sees that he didn't express enough feeling a bound with Ray as if the last is a symbol for the suppression which could kill a talented artist. We can read this movie as a conscience of importunate fear Allen has.Anyway I loved it. It was fantastic how Allen out of some unfinished or uncertain stories made his own version of Emmet Ray's bio. However I felt something was missing with the background of the character. His history was a bit vague. I know well that he was poor to the extent that made him afraid of being poor again so he worked a lot threw money away for looking rich having this strange love to steal he to some extent just wants to own. But on the other hand I didn't understand what the secret of his fear to express was ? was it some kind of compulsory obsession ? was it something in his childhood ? was he that shy of his early poor life ? another unanswered question  He drank much to forget what  his fear ? or his inner belief that he wouldn't be great due to this very fear ?There are some nice moments. The ones with his wife were so serene and hilariously comic. Samatha Morton is an angel from heaven. She was sent to do this role. Now I knew that angels can't look like they're acting at all they can be so realistic and damn believable ! Sean Penn proves that he's a master of characters. He did it nearly flawlessly. However he was lowdown and no sweet ?!! And finally there is nothing and I mean nothing can be more joyful more than witnessing how the old jazz tracks that Woody adores fit perfectly in the movie he directs. Ahhh I felt deep relief about that apart !It's romantic funny sad. And based on true and false stories as if there isn't a history that suffers from the same thing ?!. Sweet and Lowdown is where all the elements that make a usual Woody Allen's movie shared to make at last a fine Woody Allen's movie. The moon that Ray dreamed of and feared of Allen captured and rode it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A mockumentary charting the last few years of the career and life of jazz guitarist Emmet Ray  considered one of the finest guitarists of the time second only to Django Reinhardt.  The film charts his colourful rise from small time pimp and kleptomaniac to the recording of the work that experts claim to be some of the best of the period.Like the title suggests this is a split film and that is the reason I think I may have had difficulty enjoying it with quite the same light laughter that I have had with Woody Allen over the past few years.  The plot is set up well with the fictional character treated for all the world as a real legend worthy of documentary treatment.  The use of talking heads frames the story well and almost allows it to be more piecemeal that it would have been able to as a straight film.  The sweet' of the film or rather bittersweet' is the comedy of the tale  the lunacy or whimsy of the whole affair and this works well and sets the tone.What then sours the mix a little is the lowdown'.  Basically the story is around quite a selfish and unpleasant character and it is hard to get past that  especially where the comedy is so very light for stretches.  It is hard not to feel that the mood of the film is changing as Ray shamelessly hurts a nave mute girl who seems to adore him  he seems to be happy to have found someone who can only listen to him talk about himself without interrupting.  There is of course redemption but this comes late and doesn't lift the fact that the lead is an unpleasant character albeit one easily mocked for his own inadequacies.To his credit Penn holds the role together and doesn't et it become so unsympathetic that the film is lost  it is only occasionally when the actions of his character overwhelm his portrayal of the character.  Support is generally good Morton is touchingly sweet despite the lack of dialogue LaPaglia is a good a mobster as you'd expect Thuman is a good part and there are some well known Allen' faces in small parts.  The talking heads are good and not overly used for comic interludes  they play it straight and let the story make the funnies.  Allen brings his passion to jazz into his bits and it's difficult to see that he has his tongue in his cheek.Overall I must admit that I didn't connect with this film as well as other Allen fans seem to have mostly because the bittersweet mix was enjoyable when leaning towards the sweet but it was less so when the bitter side understandably was brought out.".

For one  and despite an honest acting performance  it's very very tedious having to watch Sean Penn playing guitar and suspend your disbelief especially when even a side character like the bass guitar player acts like he's never even seen an instrument before. Something's gone terribly wrong with the story as well from the onset you're left wondering where it's heading at. Meek puns are badly delivered and poor dialogues try hard to be funny Uma Thurman's overblown performance is just one example here. Generally speaking you get the feeling that not much time was wasted on character design which is all the more problematic as the entire film hinges on one central figure. Of all things the comments are redundant and spoil much of the potential fun. Worst of all an offscreen character comment inner dialogue pops out of nowhere near the end of the film making you wonder what went wrong in the story design that had to be somehow recovered in the editing. Amateurish to say the least. Of course like so many Allen movies this one has also quite a few things coming its way most notably set design and image. And unlike his cheaper flicks we're awarded a string of atmospheric exterior location shots. But in the end it simply doesn't add up. You just don't make an entire movie on a onesided caricature of a character. And it certainly looks like Allen couldn't make up his mind on the genre of film he wanted to make. Just as Emmet Ray is second to Django Reinhardt this Woody Allen doesn't live up to himself.".

The film picks itself up again towards the end but that middle section fails to interest. However Sean Penn is easily one of our finest actors and gives an incredible performance that's matched by a heartbreaking Samantha Morton. Together the acting chemistry is breathtaking when they're apart the film drags.  Both actors more than deserved the praise and awards bestowed upon them and their work here will probably be considered classic one day.  As great as the actors are the sets and costumes music and  lighting all play a major contribution to the feel of this film and show an amazing commitment to detail that Woody should be applauded for.

	schema:headline " The best Woody Allen film in 10 years";
	schema:reviewBody "Sweet and Lowdown is the story of a musician who through two broken relationships one with a mute woman the other with a his adulteress authoress wife is able to access true creativity and selfexpression. This of course makes it sound like the most dreary awful EasternEuropean psychodrama. Or worse a return to the housebound Woody of Interiors and September particularly when one sees that Allen does not act in the film. But have no fear. This is far and away the best and funniest Woody Allen film of the last 10 years. Allen's biggest obsession bigger even than  sex or illness has always been how the artist can sustain normal human relations. That theme is here more explicit than in any other of his films. Although there are romantic and comic elements this is very much a film about how the artist finds himself.In the fictional 1920's jazz guitarist Emmet Ray Sean Penn excellent he has created a fellow neurotic jazz freak with an added selfdestructive streak. The director is often accused of presenting on film a fantasy version of himself more feral and self confident. Here he goes overboard portraying a selfish insecure  angry kleptomaniac alcoholic shopaholic near genius. The insolently talented musician at the heart of the film is surely a wishfulfilment for Woody who has been slugging through his Monday night clarinet playing gig at Michaels Pub NYC since 1971. The wannabe stud of his early stand up performances and the worshipper of Sidney Bechet are fused together in the scene in which Penn wins over the mute girl Hattie Samantha Morton with a for him perfunctory version of I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles'. PennRay  communicates the feeling of homage in so much of Allen's work. For his iconic attitude toward the partially disabled French guitarist Django Reinhardt we can read Allen's own constant nods to Bergman and Fellini. Artistic insecurity is a theme that runs through the film Every time Penn's declares himself in his stabbing bratish voice to be The best guitarist in the world...except  maybe for this gypsy in France'  we hear a little more desperation enter his soul. The suffering rejection and pain he suffers are gradually revealed to be the doors rather than blocks to artistic expression. He is told repeatedly that if he were only able to access his emotions he would play better. This is finally brought about by the departure of his wife.Uma Thurman barely recognizable in period costume plays the part and she is the kind of glamourous selfreferencing pretentious artistintellectuall  obligatory in all Allen's work. Her shallowness is contrasted by the feeling she inadvertently brings about in her exhusbands playing. Pain leading to creativity ?  Strained relationships with weird women? Locking yourself in a room for three days to listen to jazz? This of course sounds very much like our idea of the postMia Allen social life. Even for a fan the directors constant use of autobiographical themes can become tiresome. But not when  supported by the excellent performances period and genre detail on display here. Real life jazz singer Ben Duncan and legendary jazz critic Nat Hentoff who I must admit I thought was dead provide commentary. References are made to such obscure figures as Buck Clayton and Eddie Condon. The soundtrack is to die for by the way why is it never mentioned how wonderful the music is in EVERY Woody Allen movie. This could push the film off into analmusojazzhell were it not for two astonoishing  central performances. Penn is fast cornering the market manchilds  reliant on but misunderstanding women. Toward the end of the film he finds it worryingly easy to portray an artist brought to his knees by selfishness and addiction. He conveys all the changed perspective of the genuinely emotionally suffering artist with one simple look at his guitar after playing his first original composition. That great antidote to male boorishness humility has entered his soul. Morton is I must admit a completely new name to me. But she is blessed with one of the most expressive faces I have ever seen on camera. She communicates her simplicityher love for Penn and her eventual disappointment with him only with her smile. It's difficult to imagine exactly where this role will take her but one hopes it will lead on to bigger things than her other near mute role in Minority Report. Finally a word about the dialogue. It has been the case for some years now that Allen jokes are best delivered by others. For pure amusement value this is one of Allen's best and it is nice to think that America's most inventive and distinctive  living filmmaker is entering his 70's and still entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "Each viewing of To Have and Have Not earns my greater appreciation of the film. The comparisons to Casablanca are numerous and fans of Humphrey Bogart will have no trouble picking them out one by one. Bogey's character Harry Morgan is once again an expatriate on foreign soil though here he has no trouble calling himself an American. The Peter Lorre part is handled by Marcel Dalio as hotel owner Frenchy while the Sydney Greenstreet presence is given to Dan Seymour the smarmy Gestapo captain. Add the smoldering presence of Lauren Bacall in her screen debut and you have the ingredients for an adventure film that almost plays out stronger in each of it's mini chapters than in the sum of it's parts. That's OK though because each tableaux presents us with rich characterization and a sense that we know who these players are and what they're up to.As most fans know the legendary BogeyBacall team up began here so I won't dwell on that. What's worth mentioning though is Bacall's brazen confidence in carrying out her role in what looks like a casting call mismatch. Only a teenager at the time of filming she looks to be about thirty with dialog that belies her years. Though her scenes with Bogart are electric even to this day it's worth noting her chemistry with Dolores Moran near the end of the film. The times Slim and Mrs. de Bursac appear together their subliminal clash over Steve fairly screams meow. That's why it's all the more comical when Bogey's character begins his operation on Paul Slim uses a leaf fan to waft chloroform fumes in the direction of the fainted madame  outrageous!My first introduction to Walter Brennan was his famous TV role as Grandpa McCoy in The Real McCoys series of the late 1950's. Here with a hitch in his giddyup Brennan sports an early tryout for that television role but with a reliance on alcohol. He's fairly philosophical about it though  Drinkin' don't bother my memory if it did I wouldn't drink. You see I'd forget how good it was then where'd I be start drinkin' water again. The best exchange between Eddie Brennan and Harry takes place on board the fishing boat as Harry explains the kind of danger they might be in. It's a masterful dialog that brings Eddie to sobriety real quick.The film's sinister side is revealed when Vichy authorities intend to disrupt any activity that might prove detrimental to German interests. As the Free French resistance look for a suitable base to continue their opposition on the island of Martinique Captain Renard Seymour warns Morgan and company  We are only interested in those persons who have broken the rules laid down for their behavior. Morgan is busy breaking the rules all over the place and gets right down to the frightening business at hand by roughing up Renard and his bunch when it appears his time on the island is growing short. Here letters of transit are known as harbor passes in another nod to Bogey's better known film.Today's viewing of the film was my third and as mentioned earlier it gets better each time. It helps that Humphrey Bogart is my favorite actor but that begs the question did Bogey make the films or did the films make the actor. As in Casablanca The Maltese Falcon Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The Big Sleep the events and characters come together to create an unforgettable story. And if for no other reason no matter how many times you watch To Have and Have Not it's always worth watching right to the very end even if just to catch Lauren Bacall's sweet sashay to the strains of Hoagy Carmichael's piano.".

	schema:reviewBody "The screen adaption of Ernest Hemingway's To Have and Have Not enjoys its place in cinematic history because it is the first screen teaming of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Turns out to have been a personal milestone for the both of them as well.I was watching my VHS copy of To Have and Have Not today and included was the movie trailer and in it Warner Brothers announced it was introducing two exciting new screen personalities Lauren Bacall and Dolores Moran. Ms. Moran was pretty enough and gave a nice performance as the wife of the resistance leader but some careers take off and some don't. Didn't hurt Lauren that she married her leading man either.The location of our story is Martinique right after the fall of France in 1940. As a French colonial possession Martinique fell into the hands of the Vichy collaborationist government. They didn't get free of them until 1943 months after the Germans occupied all of France in November of 1942. Humphrey Bogart is an expatriate American along the lines of his Richard Blaine character in Casablanca. He doesn't own a swank nightclub he's just got a charter fishing boat that lives on and runs with an alcoholic pal Walter Brennan. But like in Casablanca a shooting in a nightclub of his client Walter Sande gets him involved with the local Vichy police and the politics of the island. It also gets him involved with Lauren Bacall who's just looking for a way to get back to the USA. She's not above a little light fingered action to help herself but all that does is get her introduced to Bogey. And their sizzling scenes made cinematic history.To Have and Have Not is fortunate to have the presence of Hoagy Carmichael one of the greatest musical talents America ever produced. He plays Cricket the club piano player and he sings and plays Hong Kong Blues one of his greatest songs. Hoagy also wrote for this film How Little We Know which Bacall sings for her supper. Dan Seymour and Sheldon Leonard play a couple of especially smarmy Vichy police officials. They have the upper hand until the very end when tables get turned rather suddenly. The only two film I've ever seen something turn that quickly is John Ford's Wagonmaster and the Richard Widmark police drama Madigan. You can only push Bogey just so far.Even in revivals today when Lauren Bacall tells Bogey all he need do is whistle and she'll come running the whistles of affection will go up in theater. As well they should.".

	schema:headline " Bacall was blessed by nature with two advantages...";
	schema:reviewBody "Lauren Bacall who gave men the license to whistle was blessed by nature with two advantages the personality of a buddy and the look of a Femme Fatale... This combination initially took the only 19yearsold actress to the top with her first two films  'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep'  scoring a success even the deadpan expressions of a Buster Keaton could not undermine... It helped of course to be costarred in them with Humphrey Bogart who fell in love with her during shooting and to have Howard Hawks who deliberately set out to prove that he could make her a star directing her every move in the same totally controlled way Joseph Von Sternberg had done with Marlene Dietrich... 'To Have and Have Not' is an almost unrecognizable adaptation of the Hemingway novel... The Rick character again appears though with a new name...

	onyx:emotionText "Lauren Bacall who gave men the license to whistle was blessed by nature with two advantages the personality of a buddy and the look of a Femme Fatale... This combination initially took the only 19yearsold actress to the top with her first two films  'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep'  scoring a success even the deadpan expressions of a Buster Keaton could not undermine... It helped of course to be costarred in them with Humphrey Bogart who fell in love with her during shooting and to have Howard Hawks who deliberately set out to prove that he could make her a star directing her every move in the same totally controlled way Joseph Von Sternberg had done with Marlene Dietrich... 'To Have and Have Not' is an almost unrecognizable adaptation of the Hemingway novel... The Rick character again appears though with a new name... The film is a fairly routinely adventure with a plot that isn't all that interesting and with a frequently laughable dialog but it sparks into life when Bogart and the leading blonde with whom he is deeply in love and to whom he will later be married appear...The girl is Lauren Bacall in her first movie...

	schema:reviewBody "Director Howard Hawks made a bet with Ernest Hemingway stating that he could make a good movie out of Hemingway's worst novel. I don't know who won or how much the bet was for but my money is on Hawks.Set on the island of Martinique Hawks' To Have and Have Not stars Humphrey Bogart as a suave fisherman who rents his boat and services to anyone with money. Alongside him is Lauren Bacall's Marie Browning a weary traveller who falls in love with him. They call each other by nicknames  she's Slim and he's Steve  but there's no mush between them. Their romantic scenes mostly consist of witty dialogue written by William Faulkner and Jules Furthman but played like a chess match. Consider a scene in which Bacall kisses Bogey. Bogey asks what the verdict is she tells him she dosn't know yet and goes in for another. Walter Brennan in one of his greatest roles plays the rummy Eddie who thinks he takes care of Bogie when in reality it's the other way around. The movie never questions their relationship. Clearly Eddie is an alcoholic and a pain in the butt but Bogey's loyalty to him is unfaltering. We thus know that when Bogey is eventually asked to help the French resistance he can't say no despite his barbed dialogue and toughguy facade. Some scholars will tell you that Hawks' films are about male bonding but they're about bonding period. And notice that Bacall's character bonding with Bogey is more central to the story than even Bogey and Brennan. Of course such strong female characters are typical in Hawks' films. Consider Rita Hayworth in Only Angels Have Wings Bacall again in The Big Sleep and Ann Sheridan in I Was a Male War Bride. But of all these women Bacall makes the biggest impression. She was discovered by Hawks' wife from a magazine photo and she fell into cinema with great ease with her gruff voice strong face and soft eyes. She never had another role as good as this one.Hawks was above all a storyteller. His eye for characters actors locations music timing pace and for cutting out the boring crap was impeccable. Take one particular moment of intensity in which Bogey shoots one of the bad guys from a gun concealed in a desk drawer. He then pulls out the gun and aims it at the remaining thugs. After a moment he realises his hand is shaking. Look at that he says to the bad guys. Isn't that silly? He shifts the gun to his other steadier hand. That's how close you came. To Have and Have Not offers some good adventure romance both on and off screen and is a great example of a particular type of writing. The only positive that bigbrother Casablanca has over it  both films essentially tell the same tale of wartime responsibility  is in its use of space. Rick's bar in Casablanca is chartered by Michael Curtiz's camera in such a way that it almost becomes a place you'd like to visit or feel you already have. It's a three dimensional space and we're given a tour of every nook and cranny.In contrast Hawks is a two dimensional director. He is unable to flesh out the bars and Casablanca inspired Hotel in which his film largely takes place. We get great lighting great compositions but it's all flat. We don't feel like this is a tangible real space. Hawks' command of mood editing lighting and music almost makes up for this but not quite.8.910  Underrated.".

Instead Mr. Hawks hired two other writers to work on the scenario for this movie William Faulkner and Jules Furthman not too shabby a combination! Mr. Hawks had an enormous talent for giving the American public films that were entertaining as well as well crafted. Mr. Hawks is responsible for discovering Lauren Bacall a young model from New York with no experience in the cinema. Well Mr. Hawk's instinct paid handsomely as Lauren Bacall went to have a fabulous career of her own.This film is interesting as well for it marked the beginning of the romance between Mr. Bogart and Ms. Bacall. Their love is there in front of the viewers to see. This movie shows us a Bogey with a heart. He was an actor that excelled in this type of picture and under Mr. Hawks's direction his Capt. Morgan makes a remarkable impression.The story has all the right ingredients to keep us interested in what is going on with all these characters in Martinique. World War II makes a detour and comes to the island.The cast for this movie is first rate. Humphrey Bogart is a tough Capt. Morgan who falls head over heels for young and lovely Slim Browning a mysterious young woman who loves adventure. Ms. Bacall has a way to sing a song that makes it unique because of her sense of style. Both these stars smolder the screen in their love scenes.Walter Brennan plays Eddie the drunken sailor that helps Morgan take tourists on fishing junkets. Marcel Dalio is Frenchy the owner of the local hotel he is the one responsible for putting Morgan in touch with the partisans operating in the island. Dolores Moran and Walter Szurovy are the De Bursac who are smuggled into the island by Morgan at his own risk they are sought by the local branch of the Gestapo.Hoagy Carmichael the great musician puts an appearance as Cricket a pianist that entertains at the hotel lounge. The three musical numbers are done flawlessly. Mr. Carmichael's rendition of Hong Kong blues stays in one's mind forever. Also we hear two other of his songs Am I blue? and a sultry rendition by Lauren Bacall of his hit How little we know. Hearing sung by Bacall makes any other interpretation superfluous.This is a film to see to enjoy great acting under the magnificent direction of Howard Hawks.".

Even the writer William Faulkner is in on recasting and making almost invisible Ernest Hemingway's novel.But this says Casablanca all over it from the opening shot of a map on. Then throw in Humphrey Bogart and a Sidney Greenstreet wannabe have an engaging piano player at the center of the popular nightclub and set it in an exotic part of the French Empire where the war is raging but you can hardly tell. Director Howard Hawks seems to be winking all the way to the box office and no one else seems to know it.Not that people aren't trying hard. Certainly the romance has gone from some archetypal dreamy impossibility with Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca to a very earthy and valid and real romance with Lauren Bacall. That's actually a big reason this movie has such fame because the BogartBacall chemistry is right there for us to watch and I mean the people not the characters. Another reason is Walter Brennan who is so odd and so convincing at the same time you have to wonder. I think Hoagy Carmichael has to be appreciated too more than he usually is. He has a major secondary role and is in the movie more than almost anyone playing the piano in all kinds of moods...and really playing it and singing too along with Bacall a little.But all this stuff never actually gels the way it should. It's almost like it knows it's imitative and so it doesn't try for actual high stakes drama or romance. If you think otherwise give Casablanca another look and besides much better screen writing and much better photography you'll see some basic emotional wires attached that are only superficial herethe War itself for one thing and patriotism and love lost rather than just love found and sacrifice of all kinds. And some character actors to beat the bandthere is no one here to match Peter Lorre or Sidney Greenstreet.These are fair comparisons because Hawks invites them. But since it is all knowing does that make this a commercial oneoff the director and his buddy Bogart winking at least at each other? Maybe. Or maybe it's the first dip into an irony about movies and about the reality and artificiality that goes with that that is deliberate and yet can't show its hand too clearly because the audience is frankly not as jaded and cold as the people making the movies. It's a really fun movie but it'll keep you on the surfaces and if you want depth don't be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " To Have Hawks and Have Wit...";
	schema:reviewBody "Most film fans know the famous bet made between Ernest Hemingway and legendary director Howard Hawks SCARFACE BRINGING UP BABY.  Hawks claimed he could make a good film out of Hemingway's worst novel.  He does and Hemingway hopefully paid up.  The great author must have forgot the star power Hawks had in access to in Bogart and Walter Brennan because that is exactly what drives the film.  They are backed by the writing of William Faulkner and the direction of Hawks who is always able to have his actors deliver slick lines quickly and effectively to have the story run smoothly. Oh yeah an actress named Betty Bacall makes her debut opposite these screen legends and makes what I consider the most auspicious debuts of any actress from the 1940's.  She meshes well with Bogie trading quips and matching her future hubby line for line.  The real star of TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is Howard Hawks a director who could create comedy suspense and art amidst a rather dull story.I never read Hemingway's novel so I couldn't tell you whether it was his worst.  I believe Hemingway made the gesture and Hawks showed him up. Notice touches of the previous year's alltime classic CASABLANCA this time the owner of the foreign booze bar is the roulette manager from CASABLANCA. World War II is a backdrop Bogie is a cynic with that heart of gold and he helps his rummy buddy played by Walter Brennan.  Bogie helped the lowlife likes of Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet in 'Blanca and in this one his scenes with Brennan are comic relief.  Brennan plays a funny drunk who is prone to spilling his guts after a few rums.  Bogie's Harry Morgan rents his boat to rich Americans for fishing and will lend a hand towards the French war effort with his sailing skills much like his power to give the infamous letters of transport to Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid. Similarities aside there is an original piece of work to see in this wellpaced semithriller with Bogie Bacall and Hawks to send them sailing into cinematic history.Just put your lips together and blow will live in filmgoer's minds forever as will the fact that Bogart and Bacall practically fall in love right in front of our eyes.  A problem I had with the film was the annoying interference of the copycat CASABLANCA French police.  Sorry no Claude Rains to add some spice to it.  I understand the movie contrasts starkly with the novel depicting the characters at an earlier age.  It is predictable and you know which girl is Bogart's.  It is entertaining to see Walter Brennan squirm and tick as a hopeless alcoholic who can't seem to remember a conversation that took place 5 minutes prior.  True Hawks has no official writing credit but the film has that Hawks touch because of the humor and genuine quality the main characters present.  TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is a picture to sit back and watch as brash Hollywood filmmaking of the 1940's and a nice piece of classic Hawks who moved onto THE BIG SLEEP with Bogart and Bacall soon after.  Its good but not the best of Hawks or Bogart.RATING 7 OF 10".

Hawks claimed he could make a good film out of Hemingway's worst novel.  He does and Hemingway hopefully paid up.  The great author must have forgot the star power Hawks had in access to in Bogart and Walter Brennan because that is exactly what drives the film.  They are backed by the writing of William Faulkner and the direction of Hawks who is always able to have his actors deliver slick lines quickly and effectively to have the story run smoothly. Oh yeah an actress named Betty Bacall makes her debut opposite these screen legends and makes what I consider the most auspicious debuts of any actress from the 1940's.  She meshes well with Bogie trading quips and matching her future hubby line for line.  The real star of TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is Howard Hawks a director who could create comedy suspense and art amidst a rather dull story.I never read Hemingway's novel so I couldn't tell you whether it was his worst.  I believe Hemingway made the gesture and Hawks showed him up. Notice touches of the previous year's alltime classic CASABLANCA this time the owner of the foreign booze bar is the roulette manager from CASABLANCA. World War II is a backdrop Bogie is a cynic with that heart of gold and he helps his rummy buddy played by Walter Brennan.  Bogie helped the lowlife likes of Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet in 'Blanca and in this one his scenes with Brennan are comic relief.  Brennan plays a funny drunk who is prone to spilling his guts after a few rums.  Bogie's Harry Morgan rents his boat to rich Americans for fishing and will lend a hand towards the French war effort with his sailing skills much like his power to give the infamous letters of transport to Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid. Similarities aside there is an original piece of work to see in this wellpaced semithriller with Bogie Bacall and Hawks to send them sailing into cinematic history.Just put your lips together and blow will live in filmgoer's minds forever as will the fact that Bogart and Bacall practically fall in love right in front of our eyes.  A problem I had with the film was the annoying interference of the copycat CASABLANCA French police.  Sorry no Claude Rains to add some spice to it.  I understand the movie contrasts starkly with the novel depicting the characters at an earlier age.  It is predictable and you know which girl is Bogart's.  It is entertaining to see Walter Brennan squirm and tick as a hopeless alcoholic who can't seem to remember a conversation that took place 5 minutes prior.  True Hawks has no official writing credit but the film has that Hawks touch because of the humor and genuine quality the main characters present.  TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is a picture to sit back and watch as brash Hollywood filmmaking of the 1940's and a nice piece of classic Hawks who moved onto THE BIG SLEEP with Bogart and Bacall soon after.  Its good but not the best of Hawks or Bogart.RATING 7 OF 10";

	schema:reviewBody "I've never read Ernest Hemingway's novel but I'm aware that Hemingway felt this was his worst novel and that apparently he and director Howard Hawks made some sort of wager that Hawks could turn this into a good movie. Sorry but in my view Hawks lost the wager. No doubt he had access to a great cast. Humphrey Bogart played the lead character of Harry Morgan  a fishing boat captain on the French island of Martinique during World War II who gets caught up in helping the French Resistance. The cast also featured Walter Brennan as his rummy sidekick Eddie and this was Lauren Bacall's film debut as Morgan's love interest Slim. Even Hoagy Carmichael appears as the piano playing Cricket. So the cast is great the story unfortunately less so.To me it came across as a weak successor to the previous year's classic Casablanca. In that classic Bogie dealt with the challenge of helping the French Resistance and dealing with the Vichy authorities in North Africa. The idea is the same here with the action transferred to the French West Indies. But the story takes a very long time in developing  it takes about an hour before we really know what's happening. That opening hour deals largely with Morgan's business relationship with Mr. Johnson who rented his boat for fishing  which really had little to do with the story as it finally developed and  admittedly just my opinion  Lauren Bacall is not the world's greatest singer! Where Casablanca provided an interesting study of the dilemma of French officials who had to choose between Vichy or de Gaulle there was none of that here. The Vichy officials portrayed seem to have no hesitations or second thoughts about serving Vichy. In the end everything seemed to fall together far too easily. There was no great buildup of suspense neither was there any release of tension as it ended. It's certainly worth watching for fans of Bogie and Bacall but in all honesty it's not a great movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well was you? That's Eddie's Walter Brennan inexorable question all throughout To Have and Have Not to anyone within earshot. And it's only the 3rd or 4th best line in the movie. Seems there's this one line where one person tries to teach another person how to whistle. And another one after a passionate kiss when a gal tells a guy that it's even better when he helps. Duh! But I like what happens after yet another passionate smooch between Bogie and Bacall. She pulls away and says to him You need a shave after which she immediately loveslaps his unshaven face. It's her way of telling him without words that she's attracted to him and she really doesn't give a good hoot whether he shaves or not.By now just about everyone knows that this movie is all about Steve Humphrey Bogart and Slim Lauren Bacall. In their first movie together the two exhibit an explosive chemistry rarely seen from any other actoractress combo. As one watches the movie with the great Howard Hawks putting the two thru their various paces one simultaneously imagines the two of them falling in love offscreen  which they did!  just as they do in this movie. For more on this I highly recommend Lauren's autobiography  By Myself. In that book she talks about the two of them sneaking around to see each other like a couple of teenagers  which she was! As I recall Bogie was still married at the time  though estranged from Mayo Methot.As for T H a H N there are many other fine elements that make it well worth one's time. A pretty good storyline revolving around the Free French contesting the Vichy French Nazi collaborators in Martinique during the early days of World War II. A strong supporting cast much reminiscent of the one in Casablanca. Great dialogue by novelist William Faulkner and Jules Furthman. Also a strong musical score Am I Blue?  How Little We Know  Hong Kong Blues by Hoagy Carmichael with a strong assist from Johnny Mercer.In a very good Humphrey Bogart movie which this certainly is one would never suspect that a young ingenue actress with little training or experience could scenesteal from a polished veteran like Bogie. And I won't say that she does such in this movie. I do know that she did not want to and was not trying to her autobiography. The fact is however that it took a star actor of Bogie's magnitude to keep Betty from dominating the screen with her earthy sex appeal and pure luminescence. Her sashay out of the bar in the last scene here is enough to make any man weak in the knees. No wonder Bogie tumbled! Both onscreen and off!So ..... tell me now ..... WAS you ever bit by a dead bee?".

He had a habit of hiring delicious young women for his movies and then well then bonding with them. In this case he had his eye on Bacall who was 18 years old but she bonded with Bogart instead. Hawks also had a habit of avoiding actors who stole his women and punishing the women too so it was Bogart's nexttolast film with Hawks. It wasn't the first time. In Kirk Douglas's movie with Hawks the actor stole Elizabeth Threatt a major masochist who came like water and like the wind she went.

Poor Hawks.The writers which evidently included Jules Furthman and William Faulkner built up a story that sizzled with sexuality at the time of its release but seems like of looselimbed gangly and amusing today. The oftparodied scene in which Bacall tells Bogart how to whistle  You just put your lips together  and blow. Hawks had an affinity for boy's adventure book values. You know a man rediscovers his pride or sobriety and overcomes his demons and whatnot. It's pretty lowbrow stuff unless you want to get into conjectural homoerotic themes. But Hawks had a solid sense of humor too. He had a tendency to rework scenes so that they had gag lines in them or amusing bits of business. This one has its funny moments too as well as a bit of action.None of it is either gripping or believable but it's fun to watch. Bogart and Bacall really hit it off on screen. Her movements are so languorous. She hunches over a bit when she walks like some tall women do. And her voice  it's down there in the subwoofer range. At the end when she and Bogie and Walter Brennan walk out of the bar Hoagy Carmichael plays a lively little tune and Bacall does a sort of shimmy that must have sent shivers up the male spines of 1944.While I think of it I'll give an example of what I meant by amusing bits of business. The scene  a French patriot must have a bullet extracted from his shoulder by Bogart. Several people stand around watching tensely. As Bogart probes the bullet hole another beautiful woman who Bacall is jealous of faints to the floor. Bacall is administering ether from a spray can and Bogart tells her to fan the fumes away from the bed or they'll all be out. When Bacall notices that no one is watching her she hastily fans the gas down towards the body of her unconscious rival. It isn't much just a second or two but it adds to our understanding of what's going on and is meanly funny.Not Hawks' best but enjoyable viewing.".

As successful as Casablanca was you can't blame a studio for wanting to churn out a Casablanca imitation. But where Casablanca is undeniably a classic film To Have and Have Not comes up somewhat short. The story is not as compelling the characters not as engaging. It's a decent film but in going so out of its way to be like Casablanca in every respect this film can't help but suffer in comparison. All the elements of Casablanca are here but all those elements worked better in the earlier film.This time rather than Morocco we're in Martinique. Bogart plays fishingboat captain Harry Morgan. Before the client to whom Harry's been renting his boat can pay him complications ensue. And now Harry is mixed up in something he wants nothing to do with. Meanwhile a pretty young woman shows up and you just know she's going to complicate things further. Harry quite begrudgingly agrees to help the resistance fighters with their cockamamie plans. And meanwhile he falls in love with the young woman. Much of the film takes place in a nightclub with a piano player warbling away because well because that's how they did it in Casablanca. Much as the BogartBergman interactions made Casablanca spark to life here it is the chemistry between Bogart and young Lauren Bacall which perks things up. They make for a great couple but the movie which surrounds them lets them down somewhat. The story is just not all that interesting. So similar to Casablanca yet for whatever reason the story here just doesn't grab you the way it did back then. No romantic rival for Bogart here along the lines of the Paul Henreid character in Casablanca that removes some tension this film could have dearly used. Could have used someone to fill a Claude Rains kind of role too. This movie is so focused in on Bogart and Bacall. This famous couple does a fine job but they could've used a little help. They have to carry pretty much the entire weight of this film on their shoulders. Their back and forth provides some great moments. But there are not enough great moments to make this a great movie.".

	schema:headline " A very pleasant film experience";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes I love classic movies because in all these years with so many movies piling up the sort of authority of hindsight exists upon them. They might have been popular at the time but now they are gems. And other times there's just a joy in the general style and feeling of those times  the great jazz musicians the lingo the styles all of that  which makes movies from the 30s and 40s really special because they show off the fantastic popular culture of the time a culture that I sometimes feel is more tasteful and intelligent than what you see in today's movies. Howard Hawks' To Have and Have Not is the best of both of those. Imagine you're in some kind of exotic bar in the middle of nowhere and Hoagy Carmichael is the in house pianist. Don't worry about what to say because William Faulkner is writing the dialog. What universe are we in? Famously this was Lauren Bacall's first movie and the movie as such testifies to the kind of rapport that Hawks could create with his leading ladies. He was truly a starmaker if anybody was. Bacall proved a major talent throughout her career but was rarely if ever as exciting as she was here. I love how she and Bogart toss things back and forth between them matches keys then matches again a perfect visual metaphor for the relationship. Bogart's in top form here his character is even more ruthless than Rick in Casablanca prior to the formulaic turnaround that he undergoes. I like some of the elements Hawks Furthman and Faulkner added to the mix here I'm excusing Mr. Hemmingway from the mix because my understanding is that his book was followed only in the vaguest sense like the jealousy in the second half where the rebel guy's wife Dolores Moran is saying stuff to him like I don't think I'll be bothered by anything you ever say again. The script is very excellent in this film one of the best in movie history I would even argue. It's amusing and exciting on so many levels you can watch it in so many different states of mind. It's a continuous cat and mouse game and then you also have these fascinating relationships like Bogart's character Steve's friendship with Walter Brennan's Eddie. Eddie is similar to the Dean Martin character in Rio Bravo he's dissipated and Steve wants to help him prove to himself that he is still a man. Brennan is a brilliant actor every scene feels spontaneous with him. You also have people like Marcel Dalio and Dan Seymour just these very professional and high quality actors and of course as mentioned the legendary composer and personality Hoagy Carmichael on the keys. I just have to admit that in our household Hoagy Carmichael is basically a deity so I have no objectivity about him but that said he's incredible in this movie. He's the midwesterner in all of us reaching for something exotic and far away singin' the Hong Kong Blues. It's also interesting how while he's sort of similar to Dooley Wilson in Casablanca he's more of a friend or mentor to Bacall's character while Bograt has his relationship with Brennan. It gives a lot of independence to Bacall and Carmichael there's a real feeling that they might possibly get cut loose from the other duo at any moment. Bacall makes sure to say goodbye to Cricket before leaving the scene at the end.The thing about this movie that strikes me most of all is the way that emotion prevails over logic at every turn both inside the movie and in the actual composition or structure of the movie. The audience really wants Bogart and Bacall to get together because we're so excited by their play their back and forth. They give as good as they take. They feel like glorious shadows to me they're bigger than actual people and more well defined. Sex writ large. Maybe censorship makes things less realistic in an objective sense. What Hawks did here with Faulkner and Furthman both master writers was to create a style of dialog that was more realistic than reality if you follow my meaning. Like dream dialogue and more real to us in the same way that dreams are more real or true than waking life.Only a few trifles drag the film down slightly... the obligatory heromartyr figures are played up a bit too heavy and don't have the substance of their equivalents in Casablanca the obvious model for this film. The benefit of losing that weight is greater freedom for the Bacall character in general because she's disassociated with the melodrama in a way that Bergman isn't in the other film but the scenes with the rebels and the discussion of the Germans feel like they are painted with a very broad stroke. The film in general is very broad and could be criticized along those lines although as I think you can gather I feel that would be missing the point. This is a great film despite whatever of those things you might argue are flaws because it features a male and female protagonist who go through a very convincing form of courtship through this film a courtship that defies the obvious even while it fulfills the intimate needs of the audience. This film was a model for many films in its wake. Bogart is able to maintain his hard boiled image because Hawks has created a woman who is convincingly modern to accompany him on his dark voyage.".

And other times there's just a joy in the general style and feeling of those times  the great jazz musicians the lingo the styles all of that  which makes movies from the 30s and 40s really special because they show off the fantastic popular culture of the time a culture that I sometimes feel is more tasteful and intelligent than what you see in today's movies. Howard Hawks' To Have and Have Not is the best of both of those. Imagine you're in some kind of exotic bar in the middle of nowhere and Hoagy Carmichael is the in house pianist. Don't worry about what to say because William Faulkner is writing the dialog. What universe are we in? Famously this was Lauren Bacall's first movie and the movie as such testifies to the kind of rapport that Hawks could create with his leading ladies. He was truly a starmaker if anybody was. Bacall proved a major talent throughout her career but was rarely if ever as exciting as she was here. I love how she and Bogart toss things back and forth between them matches keys then matches again a perfect visual metaphor for the relationship. Bogart's in top form here his character is even more ruthless than Rick in Casablanca prior to the formulaic turnaround that he undergoes. I like some of the elements Hawks Furthman and Faulkner added to the mix here I'm excusing Mr. Hemmingway from the mix because my understanding is that his book was followed only in the vaguest sense like the jealousy in the second half where the rebel guy's wife Dolores Moran is saying stuff to him like I don't think I'll be bothered by anything you ever say again. The script is very excellent in this film one of the best in movie history I would even argue. It's amusing and exciting on so many levels you can watch it in so many different states of mind. It's a continuous cat and mouse game and then you also have these fascinating relationships like Bogart's character Steve's friendship with Walter Brennan's Eddie. Eddie is similar to the Dean Martin character in Rio Bravo he's dissipated and Steve wants to help him prove to himself that he is still a man. Brennan is a brilliant actor every scene feels spontaneous with him. You also have people like Marcel Dalio and Dan Seymour just these very professional and high quality actors and of course as mentioned the legendary composer and personality Hoagy Carmichael on the keys. I just have to admit that in our household Hoagy Carmichael is basically a deity so I have no objectivity about him but that said he's incredible in this movie. He's the midwesterner in all of us reaching for something exotic and far away singin' the Hong Kong Blues. It's also interesting how while he's sort of similar to Dooley Wilson in Casablanca he's more of a friend or mentor to Bacall's character while Bograt has his relationship with Brennan. It gives a lot of independence to Bacall and Carmichael there's a real feeling that they might possibly get cut loose from the other duo at any moment. Bacall makes sure to say goodbye to Cricket before leaving the scene at the end.The thing about this movie that strikes me most of all is the way that emotion prevails over logic at every turn both inside the movie and in the actual composition or structure of the movie. The audience really wants Bogart and Bacall to get together because we're so excited by their play their back and forth. They give as good as they take. They feel like glorious shadows to me they're bigger than actual people and more well defined. Sex writ large. Maybe censorship makes things less realistic in an objective sense. What Hawks did here with Faulkner and Furthman both master writers was to create a style of dialog that was more realistic than reality if you follow my meaning. Like dream dialogue and more real to us in the same way that dreams are more real or true than waking life.Only a few trifles drag the film down slightly... the obligatory heromartyr figures are played up a bit too heavy and don't have the substance of their equivalents in Casablanca the obvious model for this film. The benefit of losing that weight is greater freedom for the Bacall character in general because she's disassociated with the melodrama in a way that Bergman isn't in the other film but the scenes with the rebels and the discussion of the Germans feel like they are painted with a very broad stroke. The film in general is very broad and could be criticized along those lines although as I think you can gather I feel that would be missing the point. This is a great film despite whatever of those things you might argue are flaws because it features a male and female protagonist who go through a very convincing form of courtship through this film a courtship that defies the obvious even while it fulfills the intimate needs of the audience. This film was a model for many films in its wake. Bogart is able to maintain his hard boiled image because Hawks has created a woman who is convincingly modern to accompany him on his dark voyage.";

	schema:reviewBody "Younger audiences and especially newcomers introduced to Hindi cinema by the stars of the 1990s must often secretly wonder why Amitabh Bachchan is such a big deal. He has never had the bulging biceps and ripped body of a Hrithik Roshan. Even in his early films he couldn't dance nearly as well as Shahrukh. Few of his movies offered elaborate song and dance numbers like those favored today. Sure he might have turned in some firstrate performances  most recently in films like Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham and Baghban  but nothing about him seems to quite justify his status as superstarofthemillennium. Right? If you muse upon these questions but are afraid to address them to your esteemed elders Bachchan groupies all then I have the answer for you Go rent Deewaar.Every once in several decades comes a movie that breaks all the norms and still manages to become not only a runaway success but also an established classic. Deewaar is one such movie. Thirty years after its release Deewaar remains one of the most famous movies Bollywood has ever produced. Those who love Hindi cinema for its extravagant song and dance routines its mix of romance comedy action and melodrama and its overthetop emoting may be surprised to learn that this 1975 explosionofamovie is conspicuously devoid of such characteristic elements. Yet Deewaar is certainly a mainstream Bollywood film. It just happens to be a phenomenal one.Deewaar begins with a terrible choice in order to save his family's lives Anand Verma Satyen Kappu the union leader of the local mine workers betrays his constituency surrendering to the mineowners' extortionate demands. In return he is humiliated and ostracized by his community. Unable to bear the shame Anand absconds leaving his wife Sumitra Devi Nirupa Roy and his two sons Vijay Master Alankar Amitabh Bachchan and Ravi Master Raju Shashi Kapoor to fend for themselves.Ravi the youngest child largely escapes the backlash sheltered from the community by his mother and brother. Vijay on the other hand bears the brunt of the trauma he becomes the target of brutal public humiliation. The consequences of Vijay and Ravi's very different experiences only intensify as the brothers grow up. In a desperate bid to give his mother the material comforts he thinks are her due Vijay takes to a life of crime. In contrast Ravi disgusted by repeated rejections in a job market powered by nepotism decides to enroll in the police force. Inevitably the siblings' differing ideologies lead to an epic moral clash that creates a deewaar or wall between them. This wall becomes insurmountable when Vijay's mother refuses to accept his illgotten riches and forsakes him to live with Ravi. Ultimately Vijay's misery compels him to seek redemption but his attempt to obliterate the wall dividing his family will exact an unthinkable price.Deewaar is in one word taut. From start to end the movie is unrelentingly tense tight somber and serious but the seriousness of the film works for two vital reasons the absolutely amazing scorching and explosive underacting by Amitabh Bachchan and the screenplay and dialogs by SalimJaved.To say that Amitabh has acted really well in Deewaar is like saying Niagara Falls is a really big waterfall it misses the enormity of the fact by several million gallons. To lovers of true cinematic acting and yes there are some such fans even in Bollywood Deewaar offers a true unadulterated powerhouse performance unparalleled in Hindi cinema. There is no living or dead for that matter actor who could have performed some of Deewaar's most muted and yet powerfully moving scenes  scenes in which Vijay's silent anguish abruptly transmutes to violent eruptions literally burning up the screen with intensity anger brutality vulnerability and gritty resolve. To the small but fiercely loyal group of Amitabh fans Deewaar is and will always be his best performance. To some of us it defines the gold standard in Hindi film acting. It is Amitabh and only Amitabh who turned this movie from a typical overthetop melodrama with great dialogs but no good songs into a gripping threehour experience that leaves the audience mesmerized and in an overwhelming majority of cases crying uncontrollably as the end credits roll.As for SalimJaved...apart from developing what is arguably the tightest script ever written for Hindi film the pair should have gotten an award for the sheer number of quotable lines in Deewaar. SalimJaved's script was also daring detour from the mainstream in more ways than one. Consider the oddities. The leading man has no songs in the movie. There is absolutely no comedy  no Johnny Lever or Asrani anywhere in sight. Meanwhile the leading lady played convincingly by Parveen Babi is a hooker who  as the narrative explicitly insists  has sexual relations with the hero. True both characters' occupations entailed a set of moral values that are lessthanperfect by Indian middleclass standards but the screenwriters still took an enormous risk by depicting some pretty bold scenes . Yet the power of the script was such that in the end audiences were rooting for both characters with great sympathy and support. Finally the leading man is an atheist albeit superstitious. Not only that one of the nowfamous temple scenes has Amitabh clearly defiant and contemptuous towards God. Quite an audacious step considering modern heroes are always shown to be terribly pious and godfearing.Finally the most significant evidence of Deewaar's superiority is the fact that unlike other hit movies like Sholay and more recent ones like DDLJ no one has ever dared to copy it. It is the one film whose magic other filmmakers realized could not be duplicated. The confluence of extraordinary acting and a uniquely brilliant script cannot be converted into a formula and regenerated ad nauseum. In the end that may be the biggest tribute Hindi cinema can pay to this alltime genuinely inimitable classic.".

Seeing it today and realising that he was still in the early stages of his career makes one wonder how he could have got even better since this movie.Not many movies can claim this effect on its audience after such a long period of time including several with Mr. Bachchan in the lead.".

Shashi Kapoor was impressive as the confused brother. Nirupa Roy is Fantastic in almost every film alongside Amitabh. Nirupa is popular in India known as Amitabhs Mother since they have made many films together. The Late Nirupa Roy gives a Magnificent Performance as the mother who goes through hardship and dilemma.

It doesn't work out that way though and Shashi betrays his brother for a 30 cent scrap of copper attached to a ribbon and called a medal.The mom in the movie annoyed me bigtime though her idealistic rantings and ravings made me yawn and ask myself if any old Indian woman could be so naive and stupid.  I mean if your son bought you the building you used to drag bricks to during it's construction 20 years ago would you throw that all away just because the son bought it with drug and smuggling money?

His performance as the angry young man who drifts to the wrong side of the tracks is brilliant  balancing turbulent fury with his charisma and cool.Yash Chopra and writer Salim Javed flood the movie with huge amounts of melodrama not especially unusual in Bollywood but take to extremes some things and scenes that would have been better left a little more subtle. The movie is quite complex and layered  something much easier to accomplish when you have 3 hours to explore and develop things as with most Bollywood movies. The excess of melodrama becomes quite draining over such a length of time though.Quite a good movie but definitely not as much fun as other AmitabhSalim Javed pairings such as SHOLAY SHAAN and the inimitable DON.".

	schema:headline " Drama At Its Peak With High Repeat Value  One Of The AllTime Best From Mainstream Bollywood";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't look for plot holes and goofs here you are to find aplenty in commercial Bollywood movies those days but if you love Hindi cinema of the 70s this one is unmissable. It firmly established Big B in his angry young man image and this unforgettable script by SalimJaved and wonderful direction by Yash Chopra packed a real punch. Even today when I switch channels at home and find this in any I can't but help watching a scene or two. Every scene every dialogue each moment of this cult classic has a high repeat value just like the Sholay released the same very year. 1975 was a landmark year in Hindi film industry as it delivered so many mega hits in one single year. This film is reflective of its times and the tumultuous socioeconomic scenario of the 70s and catapulted each one involved with this project to greater heights. 810".

However ..... there is a SERIOUS flaw! Remember the first and the last shot of the film? Its the mother accepting a medal on behalf of her son inspector Shahshi Kapoor. Remember everything in between? Its all in flashback. So? What is wrong with that? Well ..... nothing!That is if you are comfortable with the mother flashing back to show us her son  Amitabh  screwing Parveen Bobby passionately Parveen attempting abortion or something the son roaming around shirtless et al. How the makers got away with it and why did they choose not to show it in linear form is still a mystery.With that minor glitch Deewar is inarguably one of the finest movies of the Big B. The writer duo of SaleemJaved has created some of the most memorable lines and one of the most fascinating films in the history of Asian cinema. The director and producer deserve a medal on each anniversary of the film! In short it is a movie that every writer actor and director should watch and keep on watching until they get it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Deewar is my one of the favorite's the main credit goes to the script writer Salim Javed and ofcourse legendary Yash Chopra who is such a fine craftsman. Deewar has no extra ordinary story its the characters which make this movie as a cult classic. For me deewar is one of those movies which was quite ahead of its time dealing with the theme of good and evil Yash chopra has done complete justice with it. The scene shot below the bridge is one of the best scene ever shot and again its the characters which should be credited for it and the punch line Mere Paas Ma Hai. In one of the scenes Vijay Amitabh makes a deal with a builder after deal is done builder advises Vijay that he is not good in business as he has purchased at a much higher price. The way Vijay reverts is simply mind blowing no words can ever express that intensity which vijay intents at that particular moment.Another best part is the love angle between Amitabh and Praveen babhi is not given much of importance unlike of our tradional cinema. The last scene of the movie where vijay prays for his Mom is again tremendous and full of energy he has simply transformed the clich dialog into one of the most memorable ones Aaj Kush to bahut honge tum Although Vijay Amitabh portray's the gray shaded character and Ravi Shashi Kapoor plays the honest cop its vijay which impacts and connects more then Ravi's character thats why i said it was way ahead of its time.The character of Vijay is based on the real character Haji Mastan big time smuggler from Mumbai. After watching movies like Deewar Trishul and Kabhi Kabhi i always baffles about the current choice of Chopra camp. God Bless them with some Sane ideas.".

Mr.Amitabh Bachchan clearly showed his power in the movie. The ease with which he turned from a coolie to an underworld don...oh my god!Its completely amazing and admirable! He proved that he is better than the best!His performance was breathtaking....spellbinding...amazing...wonderful...outstanding!The world searches for words to describe this man!Vijay VermaAB was a man who loved him mother too deeply...and his love for his mother forced him to do bad deeds.He was the one who suffered the injustice of the society. He skips studies and goes to work in the footpaths as a child to help his mother and make his younger brother study and achieve his goals.He grows into a coolie and his younger brother Ravi Verna  Shashi Kapoor grows into a graduated man seeking a job.At that time Vijay gets into a fight with some goons of an underworld don seeing the injustice shown to a poor worker by the latter which results in the worker's death. Vijay beats them all and his name spreads among the other workers. He is called by another donDaawar to help him carry out the smuggling businesses. Vijay In order to wipe away the tears of his mother and to give her a good life agrees to the the job. He soon becomes the Saviour of the gang and is the head in a short time. At this timeRavi becomes a police officer who is very true at his work He soon finds out that his brother made all his wealth through smuggling He and his mother leave the house of vijay breaking the poor man's heart. The movie also has Parveen Babi Neetu singh pairing opposite Amitabh and Shashi respectively. The film ends with Vijay being shot dead by his own brother.That Scene is considered the best in the movieThe scene where Vijay dies on the lap of his mother.Mr.Bachchan's acting was fabulous in the movie....the scene is a clear cut example for it. Most of the other scenes too are awesome. Some of the best are  1First and formost the last scene when Amitabh dies in lap of Nirupa Roywho portrays his mother...clearly the best scene...Amitabh's acting make you awe him!!! 2Ravi confronting Vijay and asking him to sign the paper confessing his underworld connections. Great scene and superb dialog!!! 3Parveen asking Amitabh to do plastic surgery and remove the writing in his hand that his father is a thief. The intensity of AB'S eyes in that scene...worth a standing ovation!!! 4The scene when Vijay says I have mansion money...blah blah...what do you have ? to Ravi and Ravi answering I have mother! and the expression on Amitabh face...superb dialog and so well enacted!!! 5The scene when Amitabh becomes the head of the gang and he sits in the seat of Daavar and places his legs on the table...the look on his faceTriumph anguish win after such suffering!!! The number of good scenes go on and on....In fact Deewaar is a film which has just too many good points!!! The film is very well directed and the plot rocks. And the script and dialogs too are wonderful!!! The performances were spellbinding especially the Big B's He portrayed the Vijay so well that people bow their heads to this great actor who is brimming with talent. Shashi capo ably supported amitabh and he truly deserves the award for the best actor in a supporting role which he got.But the fact remains that he is overshadowed by Amitabh's powerhouse performance. Though Vijay has done many wrongs you still get to love him. Its all credit to Amitabh for that. In short this film is a legend...a classic...a wonder of a movie! A must watch...with Amitabh at his best!Deewaar and Sholay which released in the same year are the biggest hits of Amitabh...and deservingly so!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched 'Deewaar' on a plane flight from India to Canada. I wondered why the Anand Verma character who sacrifices his reputation to save his family would simply abandon his wife and 2 sons to become a perpetual traveler on Indian railway trains.The movie makes only a feeble attempt to explain why Vijay Verma Amitabh Bacchan gets drawn to a life of crime. Both Ravi Verma Vijay's younger brother played by Shashi Kapoor and his mother seem like idealized caricatures than like real people. In spite of that I somehow prefer Shashi Kapoor's performance over Amitabh's. The former seems to have more screentime and lines than Amitabh does yet 'Deewaar' is remembered as an Amitabh Bacchan vehicle.Ravi Verma's romance with Leena Narang Neetu Singh is a distraction and does not add anything to the movie. Poor Neetu Singh. She is absent during much of this movie. It would have been better to get rid of her character altogether. The 2 songs in this flick are so unmemorable that the movie would have been better without them. And unique too since song sequences are considered de rigueur in Indian cinema. Not having any songs in this movie would have made 'Deewaar' a high watermark in Indian film history. Vijay Verma's love interest Anita played by Parveen Babi is a far more interesting character than Leena Narang. She should have been given more screen time.The film's premise that a police officer would be ready to kill his own brother for the sake of justice is highly unrealistic. But then this is one plot hole that the viewer should be expected to overlook.However it must be admitted that 'Deewaar' is worth watching by fans of Hindi cinema if only because of its reputation. I am happy that I was finally able to view this film.".

Basically the Verma brothers Ravi Shashi Kapoor and Vijay Amitabh Bachchan follow different life choices and career paths Vijay becomes a criminal expert in smuggling and Ravi becomes a police inspector assigned to locate lawbreakers. They are the son of trade unionist Anand Verma Satyendra Kapoor who used his family as bait going against the management of his firm and it resulted in being defeated and disgraced and unable to cope with public humiliation he deserts the family. The two sons are raised by mother Sumitra Devi Nirupa Roy and taken to Bombay City but as time goes by the two individually cause her as a single mother terrible trials and tribulations because of their choices. Vijay the older of the brothers has grown up aware of his father's humiliation and is victimised by those who know of it as well he did start well in his youth as a simple boot polisher and dockland worker but turns to a life of crime and a leading figure in the underworld. Ravi gets a good reputation for bringing law and order to the city and his next assignment is to find a big name in the smuggling ring he gets a terrible shock when he finds out it is his own brother so he has no courage to arrest him and bring more shame to the family despite his numerous opportunities. Also starring Parveen Babi as Anita Neetu Singh as Leena Narang Manmohan Krishna as DCP Narang Madan Puri as Samant and Iftekhar as Mulk Raj Dhabaria. Bachchan as the young man who follows the wrong path is great at creating a both hateful and sympathetic character and as his law abiding Kapoor does very well also the story is just about easy to follow a brother going bad and the other good and not stopping the law breaking due to the family bond and wanting to avoid disgrace it is certainly a worthwhile drama. Good!".

Ravi gets a good reputation for bringing law and order to the city and his next assignment is to find a big name in the smuggling ring he gets a terrible shock when he finds out it is his own brother so he has no courage to arrest him and bring more shame to the family despite his numerous opportunities. Also starring Parveen Babi as Anita Neetu Singh as Leena Narang Manmohan Krishna as DCP Narang Madan Puri as Samant and Iftekhar as Mulk Raj Dhabaria. Bachchan as the young man who follows the wrong path is great at creating a both hateful and sympathetic character and as his law abiding Kapoor does very well also the story is just about easy to follow a brother going bad and the other good and not stopping the law breaking due to the family bond and wanting to avoid disgrace it is certainly a worthwhile drama. Good!";

His mission is to find some criminal evidence to topple his former boss Cinema City board member Dean Shek. A first he dismisses the gig until he realizes they're going to his eager younger brother Leslie Cheung. Once Lung is out he notices that everything is not quite as it seems.An interesting film.

John Woo wasn't pleased with this and he voiced his displeasure. The final rift came during the editing of the film. Tsui Hark wanted the movie to be under two hours so it could have more showings John Woo wanted it to be an epic. Guess who one out? Say what you will about this film the action scenes are pure Ching SiuTung. His wild action scenes made this movie. Mr. Tsui must have liked him a lot because he went on to choreograph the action scenes in The Killer although he was credited with stunt coordinator the action scenes have all of his visual trademarks.The budget was huge on this one. It was filmed in Hong Kong and in the United States. Tsui Hark had another one of his friends Peter Wang costar in the movie as well he plays the inner city priest Dean Shek meets in N.Y.C.. Despite the friction caused by the behind the scenes squabbling A Better Tomorrow II is a magnificent exercise in the ultraviolence. Awesome!Highly recommended.The last film in the trilogy is the epic A Better Tomorrow III Love and death in Saigon.".

	schema:headline " A Far From Perfect But Satisfying Conclusion To The Original";
	schema:reviewBody "After the movie 'A Better Tomorrow' became a big success around Hong Kong a sequel was inevitable to happen. Most of the original cast return including Chow YunFat as Mark Lee's twin brother Ken.Taking place a few years after the events of the first film we see how things are finally starting to look up. Ho is in prison but he's finally re concealed his relationship with his brother Kit who has become a loving husband and soon to be father. But like the first film things get bad real quick. Ho's former master Lung has been framed for murder and even loses his mind as his life gets worse. He's sent over to New York to keep a low profile and to be looked after by Ken who owns a restaurant and lives there. Meanwhile Ho and Kit are working together to end the triad gangs.This is where the problem starts. The first film revolved around Ho and the people around him but this film spends way too much time with Ken trying to get Lung back to normal. Ho and Kit's plot seems to delve deeper into the main story ark yet they never seem to get enough scenes. Ken is pretty much similar to Mark although he may be a little darker and you can tell he's only in the film because of Chow YunFat's character was so popular in the last film.The film doesn't seem to make a huge continuation onto the first film either. Instead of being it's own story it seems to just be an expansion of the first film but not in a good way. We don't delve too much into the characters and they seem underused. The film is also known for having a sillier feel in a few scenesFamous Rice Scene but it didn't ruin the experience for me. These flaws are apparently due to disagreement between John Woo and producersecond writer Tsui Hark about the tone of the film causing Woo to disown most of the film except the end shootout. John Woo's original cut was around 3 hours and is rumoured to improve on some of the flawed moments. A version I hope will appear in some future release of the film.Now for the goods. The film seems to get noticeable better during the second half beginning with the amazing hotel shootout. The film is well known for it's exaggerated violence and blood and the film doesn't disappoint. The action is a big step up from the first and some of the best ever filmed for its time. Chow YunFat is once again cooler than ice with his trademark sunglasses trench coat matchstick and dual pistols and may be one of the main appeals of the film. The Climatic assault on the triad mansion is one of the greatest shootouts and one of the greatest ending ever filmed. It's no wonder that it's the only thing Woo likes about the film. The amazing soundtrack returns and their are a few emotional scenes that actually work well.With many iconic scenes The stairs scene being one the film is a lot better than it gets credit for. The film is no masterpiece and doesn't compare to the first but it has its moments. Silly and flawed moments aside the film is actually quite enjoyable and as long as you keep an open mind I think you'll enjoy this conclusion to the Better Tomorrow saga. Part 3 doesn't count!".

In addition if you're not able to take a John Woo's best adrenaline HK classic action sequel flick  ignore this review as well. We'll both be better off.A Better Tomorrow II 1987 is an adrenaline action sequel flick the best one of the two from John Woo. I know that the first one is an action classic for many of the people and they always going for the first one but my favorite flick is this sequel. I know that The Godfather 1972 is my favorite film in the series but from John Woo's A Better Tomorrow is actually A Better Tomorrow II my favorite John Woo film. I love this movie to death the acting is wonderful believable and very realistic and Chow YunFat which is my favorite actor gives one of his best convincing performances I have ever seen as Mark Gor's twin brother Ken. Not only he but everyone of the cast gives a wonderful performances on a screen which I love it.Plot Restaurant owner Ken Gor twin brother of Mark Gor teams up with police detective Kit and his struggling excon brother Ho to avenge his old friend's daughter's death by a Triad gang.What I love about this movie is Chow YunFat does not die in this movie he acted wonderful his different character Ken. Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung are back as the brothers from the first film which I am not sure but I have saw a lot of actors from The Killer in this movie. This movie was also filmed in New York which you can see Twin Towers from the distance before it was destroyed in 911 terrorist attack. John Woo made one of his best action debut and making a perfect shots with the camera of this film. I admitted I am not a the biggest fan of the first and the third movie but this one surprised me which I loved it. In my opinion this film is better than the original. Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung's characters Ho and Kit are actually more well written than they were in the first. I hated it how Kit was treating his older brother beating him in the rain treating him like a peace of garbage I hated that. In this film we see Kit's love and compassion toward his older brother Lung. Both of their characters were well written.This film is about a counterfeit dollars that are produced in the business and a new boss from Ho took over Lung Sei's business while framing Lung for a triad gang member's boss murder which he did not committed in which Lung had to flee to America New York but his daughter was killed. The plot is about a revenge Lung Sei Dean Shek Ho Ti Lung and Ken Chow Yunfat are taking revenge against new triad boss Ko Yingpui Kwan Shan and his group of army killers. Lung Sei want's revenge for the murder of his daughter Peggy Regina Kent Ho want's revenge for Kit's Leslie Cheung murder and Ken want's revenge for his restaurant in New York that has been destroyed. That is the film about. It has a lot of action and kick ass scenes and it also has a human emotional portrayal from the actors.I love the action sequences in New York from Ken Chow YunFat in the hotel a group of assassins comes to kill Ken and Lung Sei Dean Shek Which Ken Chow YunFat uses shotgun Franchi SPAS12 and kills several mafia gangsters in the hotel New York. He fires several rounds with two Berettas 92F on a gangsters than flees while he fires another round with another gun on an assassins car. The final showdown and the last stand off with two Berettas between Ken Chow YunFat and Chong Lung Mingyan the firing scene was outstanding performed I have ever seen. John Woo tried that scene in Hard Boiled but he didn't want to copied his own work so he change it. Ti Lung uses a samurai sword and he kills bunch of gangsters. The trio of friends uses a lot of guns and grandees while killing a bunch of gangsters. The final showdown for me was spectacular.Overall This flick get's a perfect 10 by me. Chow YunFat and Leslie Cheung's screen time was beautiful shot well written and acted perfectly. Theme score from the first movie was also beautiful the action scenes where incredible. They don't make action movies like this one today. This flick is far way better than John Woo's Once A Thief. With Hard Target Broken Arrow Hard Boiled Paycheck and The Killer would be a Better Tomorrow II my sixth John Woo favorite film that I love to death.A Better Tomorrow 2 is a 1987 Hong Kong action film written and directed by John Woo. A followup to its popular predecessor A Better Tomorrow the film stars returning cast members Chow Yunfat Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung alongside new cast member Dean Shek.

I love Woo's explosive style of close gun battles and overthetop carnage. I mean is it really necessary once pumping 2 lethal rounds into the bad guy's chest thus assuring his death to empty the clips from both handguns into him as he is staggering back?

But his convenientlyneverbeforementioned twin brother Ken is at full strength and just as cool as his brother throughout this sequel. Some of the instances in this movie defy explanation  such as how Ken could pick the one day to walk past his local insane asylum in Manhattan and recognize an old friend from mainland China being restrained by orderlies and just how invulnerable is Kenneth Tsang in that final shootout the guy was shot to the ground once at pointblank range three times and still nonchalantly walked away!?

	schema:reviewBody "The first 'A Better Tomorrow' was a stunning kinetic and emotional rollercoaster that changed the face of HK cinema. The success of ABT meant a sequel and some bright spark decided that Chow Yun Fat whose character was definitely quite dead at ABT's finale should make a return.A prequel would have made more sense but instead Chow yun Fat returns as dead Mark's identical twin Ken. Holy plot contrivances Batman! After reformed gangster Ho is sent to prison at the end of ABT his brother Kit has gone undercover to investigate a suspected counterfeiter. Given the chance to join the investigation Ho is released to act as an informer if only so he can protect Kit.All good so far right? The film does well to pick up from where last time left off thankfully bringing back Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung... but then totally takes the wrong direction. To me Chow Yun Fat may have been the charismatic centre of ABT but it was always about the brothers Ho and Kit. In ABT2 the film spends way too much time on two NEW characters  the twin brother Ken and framed gangster Si Lung who is gradually going insane after falling foul of Hong Kong's triads. For every tense sequence of Ho and Kit's investigation there's two or more scenes or Si Lung's shaking and shuddering and Ken's attempts to snap him out of it.As far as the action goes there are no complaints here. The finale is topdrawer chaos on behalf of John Woo and at least gets a great build up sequence to lead into it. But the story focuses on characters and subplots that to be frank are mostly irrelevant. Before you criticise me I love Woo's other work. But saying 'this is a John Woo film' and that 'action is the priority' would do a disservice to the original which may have changed action cinema but always kept in mind the story and characters at hand.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Woo directed and wrote this sequel Better Tomorrow 2 1987 to his heroic bloodshed action smash hit Better Tomorrow which he had made year earlier in 1986. The story begins where the first film left as Ho Ti Lung is in prison after the gun battle in which he and his brother Kit Leslie Cheung and Mark Lee Chow Yun Fat met their destiny at the end of the first film. Ho gets an opportunity to free himself from prison by helping police in finding a powerful crime lord and trapping him. Kit is police again and works in the same underground operation as Ho. This all leads to series of betrayal death and fighting back as Mark's twin brother Ken Chow arrives from New Your to Hong Kong to help his friends in this heroic fight that will end in one of the most overthetop gun battles ever committed on celluloid.This film is more fierce than first Better Tomorrow but not as fierce and merciless as Woo's most personal masterpiece Bullet in the Head. Tomorrow 2 tells the same things about friendship and honor that the first film also told. In Woo's world violence is always there and it is among the few ways his characters are able to communicate. Bullets are angry and when they hit the result is always sad and irrevocable. Woo never accepts violence or justifies it he just uses it in his films which are there to be interpreted and analyzed. His characters can be good and bad at the same time and he studies these elements in human psyche thru his films. He definitely doesn't praise violence as he has also said in interviews that he hates violence and that's exactly why he depicts it so powerfully and also disturbingly in his films. He depicts violence in a way it is hard to neglect unlike most of the mainstream action films produced in Hollywood. When a man grabs a gun in order to use it at some other human being he takes the full responsibility for his actions and this is once again very sadly shown in Better Tomorrow 2.Better Tomorrow 2 is not as visually stunning as the first film which ends in brilliant night time scene at the harbor where smoke and blue are as alive as the characters in that sad finale. Even greater use of color and smoke is in Ringo Lam's City on Fire as the end of the film with all its bullet holes and menacing atmosphere is among the most memorable segments in Hong Kong action cinema history. Woo uses his camera in Tomorrow 2 again very professionally but the film doesn't look exactly as great as first Tomorrow film. The final gun battle deserves also to be mentioned since it is so incredible. The film was action choreographed by another Hong Kong master Ching Siu Tung who has been a choreographer in many Asian classics and has also directed films like Duel to the Death Witch From Nepal and more notably A Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and Swordsman films. The martial arts action and choreography in his films is totally stunning and also unique and this really can be seen in Better Tomorrow 2 and especially in its finale a gun battle so over the top it is almost cartoonish but still never comic or laugh indulging at all. It is the most fierce segment of bullet spitting blood spraying gun mayhem I have witnessed in any film and I think the films which manage to come near this scene's power come also from some Orient country probably from Hong Kong since these film makers have their style in using camera and edits and it seems to have no comparison with films from other countries.Better Tomorrow 2 is great piece of action mayhem cinema with heart too but this is not its director's masterpiece which is in my opinion Bullet in the Head a film which the director himself prefers too. Better Tomorrow gets 910 from me and since it is not as deep and philosophical as possible I really want to appreciate its cinematic styles and interesting themes and messages of film maker John Woo.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original A Better Tomorrow changed the face of action films forever. A shootemup gangster melodrama from a thenlittleknown filmmaker named John Woo Tomorrow's rampant violence and stylish action scenes instantly established Woo as one of the greatest action directors in the world and the result was one of Hong Kong's highest grossers ever. After the trendsetting scene where Chow YunFat burst into a room and gunned down a group of bad guys in all sorts of stylish and inventive fashions everybody in Hong Kong had to go out and buy a trench coat like the one he wore which guaranteed the actor instant stardom as well. Naturally a sequel had to be made right away and in 1987 came A Better Tomorrow II. You can tell it was rushed into production because it's a little rough around the edges which probably explains why John Woo has never made another sequel since. And unfortunately most of the copies you are likely find of this movie will be marred by atrocious subtitles which are hard to read chopped off at the sides of the screen and are fraught with spelling errors. You're not even two minutes into the movie before you see hopefully spelled hopelully. But bad subtitles do not ruin a film where what you see on the screen is too explosive to be described with words.This was the film where John Woo demonstrated that he could just go allout and two of his works that followed this The Killer and Hard Boiled are placed by many among the ranks of the greatest action films of all time. While A Better Tomorrow II is certainly a dynamic piece of work by Woo it will never be looked upon as a strong example of action movie storytelling. The plot is often confusing and lazily constructed and commits the ultimate sin of sequels when Chow YunFat is introduced into the story. You may recall that his character Mark was killed at the end of the original Better Tomorrow so how can he return for the sequel? Why by saying that Mark had a twin brother of course. Normally absurd contrivances like that are enough to destroy the credibility of an entire movie but all is instantly forgiven in Chow's introductory scene when he responds to a mafioso kingpin's bullying by forcing him to eat his rice. It's a delightful hilarious sequence and NO other action star could've pulled it off. After watching it I was quite happy that Mark had a twin brother.It's the individual moments like that which make A Better Tomorrow II an action classic. On an overall scale it may not be as good as its predecessor but the moments that do work turn it into a much more exciting film. And boy when this film works it WORKS! The final twenty minutes may be the best you see in ANY action film! A very powerful death scene is immediately followed by an absolutely incredible finale in which the heroes barge into the home of the villain and deliver carnage like you've never seen it before. The heroes use guns grenades and even a samurai sword to mow down the opposition and by the end there are more bodies than one can count. This is the first action set piece in which John Woo just decided to go completely berserk though it would certainly not be the last. Of course everything in Better Tomorrow II is overthetop melodrama and would probably seem laughable if seen in an American action picture but what sets the Hong Kong genre apart from all others is that the sheer energy and passion in the filmmaking can make even the hokiest of situations work wonders. And at its best Better Tomorrow II does work wonders. It is so easy to overlook a film's flaws when it makes the can'tmiss decision to deliver the goods in the most electrifying ways possible.".

This mix of action and parody looks weird when you expect a straight sequel to the first one but give it a second try  then check out the third part by Tsui Hark and the other John Woo's movies except Broken";

	schema:reviewBody "Being a big fan of John Woo's kinetically charged Hong Kong action films including the first A Better Tomorrow this one came as a huge disappointment. In fact I could barely watch it.I won't mention Woo's American films because those are really studio controlled productions and not what I would consider 'true Woo'. No I don't like them at all.But his Hong Kong films really were the works of the auteur. One had a sense that a significant amount of forethought went into planning many of the shots and fantastic action sequences. There was always a sense after viewing movies such as The Killer Hardboiled Bullet in the Head etc. that one had just seen an original and creative take on a not so original genre. The slow motion shooting a touch of Peckinpah mixed in with fast and furious movement and close quarter gun battles was both stylish and exhilarating in these works.A Better Tomorrow II may be at best adequate for a run of the mill Hong Kong action flick. For a film with John Woo's name on it it's a big letdown. The action scenes seem rushed and are simply uninspired. The shootout in Ken's New York hotel was generic and boring. Chow Yun Fat's backslide down the stairs while shooting at a bad guy seemed like a bad photocopy of vintage Woo. Maybe it was the bad lighting I don't know...it just didn't seem to work.And while these films always indulge in overblown melodrama often with humour some of the scenes in ABT II were just painful to watch. Uncle Lung's breakdown in New York City was so overblown and ridiculous that one had the sense of watching a high school play. What makes this film even more frustrating is that there were small moments of true acting indicating an unrealized potential. When Uncle Lung Dean Shek is at his daughter's grave he looks up at his friends and for a couple of seconds his face reveals a true unspoken sadness. It was a flash of brilliance in an otherwise plethora of forgettable performances.Another big problem with this production is a series of unexplained events and situations. One of the most obvious occurs after Kit has been shot by his big brother. We see his wife and brother at the hospital. A doctor comes out to talk to them. We don't hear what is said but we see Kit's wife and brother break down and cry. One assumes that Kit has died. But later without any explanation whatsoever Kit appears ready for action.Another oddity is Kit's wife suddenly going into labour at the hospital without any previous indication whatsoever that she was ever pregnant in the first place. All of these factors result in a poor work from someone who normally creates masterpieces USA productions excepted. One has the sense that he allowed the studio to rush him and as a result we get this piece of wet cardboard.This film is only for true WOO fanatics who simply must see all of his films.".

Once Chow appears the plot becomes wildly unbelievable but one can follow it with amusement and interest. Ti lung must also be credited with turning in a strong and wellgrounded performance even when the script calls for him to get schmaltzy.This is also the film that salvaged character actor dean Shek from obscurity he wanted to prove he could act and though he over acts occasionally he actually does pretty well especially in the final gun battle.It must be said that throughout his career John Woo has repeatedly attempted to grasp the essence of the 'battle of bloody porch' from Sam Peckinpah's the Wild Bunch and duplicate it  and he has always failed. that's because to be honest Woo is a believing Christian and although raised in the Calvinist tradition Peckinpah clearly does not believe. Woo simply cannot grasp the basics of Peckinpah's existentialism.Consequently the final battle here while a lot of gory fun doesn't really make the point Woo clearly wants for it which is a believing Christian's interpretation of the Wild Bunch but  never mind. On its own terms as I say it's quite fun.As for the 'serious' story concerning the young undercover cop and his pregnant wife I didn't believe it for a moment and frankly didn't care. I'm afraid I'm not a believing Christian either.".

	schema:headline " An Unnecessary but Entertaining Sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "A Better Tomorrow II is another unnecessary sequel. It's up there with sequels such as The Hangover Part II and Home Alone 2 Lost in New York in the sense that it doesn't develop the characters any further and seems to only exist just because the original made a lot of money. But is it really that bad? Let's find out!The story here just isn't very good. There isn't enough focus on Ho and Kit and there's no emotional weight here. Instead we focus more on a new character named Lung Sing who is a money counterfeiter and the mentor of Ho and... he's just not a very interesting character. He never deals with any dilemmas that we can relate to like Ho did so we just don't care for him. And Ho and Kit don't go through any arcs in this movie they never learn anything or go through any personal problems so why should we care? The thing that made the original A Better Tomorrow great was that it was a real human drama at its core but still had great action in it. This film got rid of all the human drama in the first film and replaced with nothing but overthetop action sequences and while they are a lot of fun they can't carry the whole film.The way they brought back Chowyun Fat was ridiculous! It turns out that he had a twin brother the whole time and somehow Ho never knew about it even though it's clear in the first film that they've been friends for quite some time. Personally if I was the writer I would've just gone with Mark surviving all those gunshots somehow and just recovered from a coma but that's just me.Also while I like Chowyun Fat2 overall there's some scenes in here that just make him look like a d!ck. He tries to get Lung to eat when he became catatonic but instead of it looking sweet and compassionate it looks kinda mean and cruel. He does it with so much force and anger it's hard to see it as an act of friendship.I also didn't quite understand why did Kit have to die in this movie. In this film he doesn't do anything wrong or make any mistakes so why does he have to die? I honestly don't understand what was Woo and Hark's intentions behind this decision. It comes off as a cheap attempt to get some emotions out of its audience and it just doesn't work as a result.So while I don't like the story in this film I still think this film is very entertaining. As mentioned earlier in this review the action is a lot of fun. They had a much bigger budget this time around and you can tell because the action is much more elaborate and explosive this time around. The gore is amplified there's more jumping and sliding across the floor more explosions more adversity to the weaponseven using a katana at one point and more slowmotion.The film is also wellpaced with never a moment of boredom and like the original the acting and composing is excellent. But while none of the actors do a bad job none of them get to show off their acting abilities like they did in the first film because nobody goes through any arcs in this movie.There's also a really funny scene where Chowyun Fat2 deals with some ahole American who starts a temper tantrum over fried rice and it's just hilarious! Chow's sarcastic mannerisms here are comedygold!Overall it's not a very good movie but it's entertaining in its own right and if you are a John Woo fan you'll definitely be pleased with the action in this movie. I'm gonna give it a 510.".

This film is far superior to the original which is usually quite unusual as it delves far deeper into the characters in this movie though it follows the theme of the original.Tsui Hark produced this movie and Chow Yun Far is one of the major actors which makes this movie one that has been developed by Hong Kong's heavy weights. The characters and cinematography may not be on par with films like Bullet in the Head and The Killer but still has enough of a John Woo mark on it to make it a superior movie. Unfortunately on the version that I watched the subtitles seemed to have been rushed as they were full of spelling and grammatical mistakes.The movie is focused around five people and jumps between New York and Hong Kong. The hero of a Better Tomorrow Ho is approached by the Hong Kong police to infiltrate an export company and find evidence that they are operating illegally. He refuses at first but when he learns that his brother is involved he decides to act. The problem is that the owner of the company was a crook but wants to get out of it and live a clean life. As he said he has a criminal past and finds it impossible to escape it. Where Ho's criminal past was chasing him in the previous movie the past is now chasing a new character but this past is far more destructive than it was in the first movie.The boss find himself the target of an assassination but while struggling with a gun the assassin decides to shoot a couple of people in the room instead making the boss believe that he is a killer. Now that he believes that he has blood on his hand he knows that he cannot escape so he flees and when he flees his daughter is killed. In New York his enemies are still after him and he watches as his brother who is now a minister in an Asian Church is gunned down along with his congregation. As he sees everybody that he cares for dying around him he slowly descends into madness.Ken the twin brother of Mark who was killed in the last movie introduces Chow Yung Far. This is a bit of a copout I feel but we quickly ignore that as Ken frees the boss from a lunatic asylum and attempts to nurse him back to health while he is being chased by hundreds of gangsters. In this scene the orange is important as it is the fruit that the boss picks up as he slowly comes out of his insanity but quickly falls back into it when the gang attacks again. It is only when he sees the chance that Ken will die as well that he comes out of it and attacks with a rabid ferocity.Back in Hong Kong Ho and his brother are going through different challenges. Here Ho is attempting to infiltrate the gang as he is seeking revenge against the death of his friend's daughter. During this he is forced to shoot and kill his brother but this is only a reflection of what is going to happen at the end. We see glimpses through the movie of Ho's brother's demise and the closer we come to it the more vivid these glimpses become. It is this part of the movie that John Woo really shines as a director. Here we see a life being born as another is dying. The death finally comes as Ho's brother speaks to his newborn child even though the child cannot hear.This movie is awesome and the gunfight at the end should receive the true title of the biggest bodycount in film history though the Killer has mass killings right through it. Still this is a brilliant action movie though its themes and characters make it far superior to your standard American action flick.".

More advanced camera angles etc. plus the picture quality is better.That may be an improvement but most of the other changes are not so good. For starters there a lot changes to do with the characters. Lung Ti's character Ho who was definitely the main character in the last film is turned into a secondary character this time round but he still does a good job acting. Lung Ti's top spot is taken by Dean Shek who plays an old friend of Ho's. While good at times I don't think he should of been given the main role. The rest of the cast do a good job with the stand out being of course Chow YunFat.One thing that does stay the same is the fabulous shootouts. They are more bloody this time and more elaborate plus there is also more of them than in A Better Tomorrow 1. Even though it changes around some characters it still has a good John Woo story. Filled with drama emotion and plenty of action.Overall it is still a good movie. It does have some big changes but it does remain an above the average action movie.".

I loved the scene when Kit appears round the corner shoots everyone in sight jumps onto a passing boat and delivers the briefcase to it's owner and there was the scene when Ken is looking after Lung and they have a big shootoutcar chase through New York. Although neither of those are as good as the scene when Ken manages to get hold of two beretta m92f automatics a revolver and a spas 12 shotgun and goes on rampage through the hotel. Mowing down gangsters in a flurry of shots. If you look closely Chow Yun Fat didn't use a stunt double for when he flips round on the stairs and slides down them headfirst on his back with two guns. Not many Hollywood action stars could do that. However all these action scenes seem like nothing when they are held up against the mighty finale when dressed slickly in black suits the heroes take up their weapons and storm through the villain's mansion. Bodies fly blood spurting from their wounds smoke and rubble fill the close quarter corridors as bullets rip everything to shreds. The walls were literally dripping with blood and the sequence when Ho played by kung fu legend Ti Lung catches a blody great sword and cuts everyone in sight to pieces. The modern day duel between Ken and Chong when they both remove their darkglasses to allow their worthy opponents a look at each other's eyes.It is a sign of honourable respect between the two gunmen. It is very different to the first and third in the seriesnot quite as good a film as the first and completely different to the third.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011. The announcement reminded me of Fase 7 Goldbart 2011 where an apartment building is quarantined due to some disease. From that moment on anything can happen between neighbors against the outside world and inside an apartment. Though the film at hand went in a totally different direction than Fase 7 the fact that anything can happen is demonstrated here again. The main characters discover things about each other revealing until then unknown sides. And the outside world in the form of city council police force and building owner does not always work logically and efficiently. On itself nothing new but such are the main ingredients. And still succeeded in keeping our attention span for the whole time.Common to both films is that we are very much dependent on the main characters while being confined in such a closed environment. Are they believable do we get their motives is there enough material to entertain us for a feature film duration?? Given the starting situation as outlined in the synopsis we can only sit back and hope for the best as no one can predict what will happen after the start. It is very difficult to describe the good things in this film without spoiling but I'll try.The story starts at 911 which explains that the police jumped to the wrong conclusion that the apartment became the target of Muslim terrorism. But the son's extraneous reaction when the police knocks on their door is only caused by him having 10K worth of cocaine lying around and that he suspects them coming for him. Nothing could be farther from the truth as the police is just accompanying a bailiff collecting an outstanding debt from the father. From that initial moment on developments scatter in many directions.The internal struggles in the apartment father son and the bailiff who was taken hostage on one hand and the interactions with the outside world on the other hand keep us entertained for 110 minutes. Circling around are the inevitable SWAT team negotiators and other officials who are not always as effective as we might expect. The trio in the apartment father son bailiff have their own problems in the mean time. And the bailiff who was taken hostage creates some unexpected turbulence after phone calls with his wife wherein she told to have just canceled a marriage counseling meeting. All in all I saw a good comedy with an ending that is a bit unexpected again I won't spoil it for you. Not a master piece that we will remember for years to come but still good work.

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011. The announcement reminded me of Fase 7 Goldbart 2011 where an apartment building is quarantined due to some disease. From that moment on anything can happen between neighbors against the outside world and inside an apartment. Though the film at hand went in a totally different direction than Fase 7 the fact that anything can happen is demonstrated here again. The main characters discover things about each other revealing until then unknown sides. And the outside world in the form of city council police force and building owner does not always work logically and efficiently. On itself nothing new but such are the main ingredients. And still succeeded in keeping our attention span for the whole time.Common to both films is that we are very much dependent on the main characters while being confined in such a closed environment. Are they believable do we get their motives is there enough material to entertain us for a feature film duration?? Given the starting situation as outlined in the synopsis we can only sit back and hope for the best as no one can predict what will happen after the start. It is very difficult to describe the good things in this film without spoiling but I'll try.The story starts at 911 which explains that the police jumped to the wrong conclusion that the apartment became the target of Muslim terrorism. But the son's extraneous reaction when the police knocks on their door is only caused by him having 10K worth of cocaine lying around and that he suspects them coming for him. Nothing could be farther from the truth as the police is just accompanying a bailiff collecting an outstanding debt from the father. From that initial moment on developments scatter in many directions.The internal struggles in the apartment father son and the bailiff who was taken hostage on one hand and the interactions with the outside world on the other hand keep us entertained for 110 minutes. Circling around are the inevitable SWAT team negotiators and other officials who are not always as effective as we might expect. The trio in the apartment father son bailiff have their own problems in the mean time. And the bailiff who was taken hostage creates some unexpected turbulence after phone calls with his wife wherein she told to have just canceled a marriage counseling meeting. All in all I saw a good comedy with an ending that is a bit unexpected again I won't spoil it for you. Not a master piece that we will remember for years to come but still good work. What impressed me most was the very long list of final credits.";

The following year the two of them moved from contemporary Philadelphia to preWorld War I New Orleans.People paid their money to hear Mario sing and really didn't care about the plots of his films. Lanza was cast as an opera singing truck driver in That Midnight Kiss as an opera singer drafted into the army in Because You're Mine and the greatest opera singer of all in The Great Caruso. I think we can see a pattern forming here.In The Toast of New Orleans Lanza plays a shrimp fisherman who works on the boat with his uncle J. Carrol Naish. When opera singer Kathryn Grayson comes to town Lanza boisterously and impulsively joins her in a duet of Be My Love. Her manager and New Orleans opera kingpin David Niven is as impressed as everyone else was in 1950 with Mario's voice. He's even willing to overlook to some extent the fact he's moving in on Grayson.Acting wise The Toast of New Orleans is no strain on anybody. Mario and Kathryn play a pair of singers and Mario as in all of his films just played himself. It's interesting that the only times he attempted to play a role from classic operetta The Student Prince and The Vagabond King it didn't work out for him. As for David Niven he's as debonair and charming as he always was. Niven carried more films on the strength of his charm than any other star in the sound era.But no one worried about acting and a plot in this film. Like That Midnight Kiss The Toast of New Orleans has a nice mixture of classical opera and some good songs by Nicholas Brodzsky and Sammy Cahn to round out a very full score. One of the songs Be My Love became Mario Lanza's signature song his biggest selling record on RCA Victor Red Seal label. You could not go ANYWHERE in 1950 without hearing Be My Love coming out of some radio. Be My Love was nominated for Best Song in 1950 but lost to Mona Lisa.Norman Taurog directed Mario in this film he had previously won an Oscar for Skippy and had directed Spencer Tracy to his second Academy Award in Boy's Town. Taurog was an interesting choice for a director to pilot a picture with a personality like Lanza. Later on Taurog would end his career directing nine of Elvis Presley's feature films another instance of him directing a megapop personality successfully.The Toast of New Orleans is for Mario Lanza fans everywhere and this review is dedicated to my father who was a big fan.".

Here he's a bayou fisherman but after the loss of their boat Pepe and his Uncle Nicky J. Carrol Naish head to New Orleans to look up the opera director David Niven who offered Pepe an opportunity after hearing him in the village when Pepe joins his prima donna Grayson in song. Pepe finds himself in love with the somewhat cold diva who is being pursued by Niven.Lanza is in fine form as a crude loud uneducated man who in order to fit into New Orleans society and the opera world has to learn manners as well as how to dance and dress. A natural actor he makes his complete transformation believable. He sings Jose's aria from Carmen beautifully and this film introduces his hit Be My Love to audiences which he sings with Grayson. With the diminutive soprano he also does Libiamo from La Traviata. In the days in which this story is set a singer like Grayson would have sung Traviata though audiences aren't used to hearing a fluttery coloratura sing it any longer. The two perform the love duet from Madama Butterfly as well  an absolutely horrid choice for Grayson calling for a much weightier voice. Obviously the repertoire was chosen with Lanza in mind. Had MGM not used Lucia in That Midnight Kiss they could have perhaps used it here. Grayson gets to use her high extension in Je suis Titania but the rest of the aria suffers from pitch difficulties.Lanza really helped to commercialize opera in the United States but he did it without the help of MGM. Is it necessary for Niven to give the wrong explanation for the duet La ci darem la mano? And why during the Butterfly duet which is total foreplay does Grayson constantly try to get away from Lanza? No matter her personal feelings she was on stage playing a role.Grayson looks lovely in an assortment of magnificent gowns and hats and if her voice doesn't match Lanza's it doesn't mean she could not have sung opera which is often the criticism. There is definitely a place for coloratura sopranos in the opera world  just not singing with spinto tenors.J. Carrol Naish plays an embarrassing annoying stereotype as Uncle Nicky Niven is wonderful if underused and his perfect voice and smooth manners are in great juxtaposition to Lanza's bumbling Pepe. James Mitchell known to soap opera audiences now as Palmer Courtland on All My Children has a good featured part as a friend of Pepe's from the bayou and he and a very young Rita Moreno who's in love with Pepe do a spirited dance number.Lanza's reign at MGM was disappointingly short and yoyo dieting and drinking would claim his life nine years after this film. But what years in which he gifted the world with his fresh passionate Italianate sound and thrilled millions of people all over the world.".

	schema:headline " entertaining if much misunderstood comedic musical romance";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a variation on the much repeated love story in which a cloistered upper class girl must choose between marrying a safe but dull man of her class or a dashing Romeo rogue. Examples include some of MGM's most popular films of the '30s and '40ssuch as Gone with the Wind Captain Blood and The Adventures of Robin Hood as well as the poorly received musical The Pirate. In The Belle of New York Fred Astaire's character incorporates both of these elements. Thus the conflict for Vera Ellen involves trying to reformulate his character so as to bring out the best mix for herevery woman's fantasy!.That is also what this love story is aboutmaking a gentleman as well as a talented opera singer out of a boisterous rough hewn bayou fisherman with a golden singing voiceMario Lanza without making him too dull and unromantic.The film begins with the festivities surrounding the annual blessing of the fishing fleet of a small early 20th century bayou fishing village. Evidently the village mayor has contracted to have an opera starKathryn Grayson and her managerescortDavid Niven arrive for this festival. Mario spends too long looking at the beautiful Kathryn and grounds his uncle's boat so that they miss having it blessed with holy water a bad omen as things turn out. Mario wants to impress Kathryn the only way he knows how by impulsively joining in her song and later practically forcing her to join in the local folk dance. This makes Kathryn look foolish twice over. Is that any way to catch a woman of her upper class breeding? Certainly not but subsequent events might make her change her mind. After his uncle's boat is wrecked in a storm Mario reluctantly gives up fishing for a possible career as an opera singer.He is groomed as Kathryn's costar but only after he gets an education on how to behave around upper class opera patrons. His relationship with Kathryn ocillates from cold to warm and back. She is a very difficult woman to consistently please or figure out! Meanwhile they both do much singing solo and as a duet not actually a lot of heavy opera until the finale Madame Butterfly performance. At one point Kathryn asks the unemotional Niven to marry her apparently to resolve the conflict in her mind about how to respond to Mario's strong romantic overtures.Now for the very puzzling behavior of Kathryn during and after their Madame Butterfly love duet. Obviously she often looks very anguished and is trying to push Mario away during most of this performance in contrast to what she should have been doing. Some have interpreted this as the real Kathryn reacting to the real Mario reflecting her well known aversion to his advances toward her garlic eating and other rude behaviors between takes. I can't believe MGM would allow this to show so blatantly although it may have been a contributing factor. Rather I favor the following interpretation as being the dominant explanation Before this performance Kathryn as well as several of Mario's village friends complain that he has become too much of a gentleman afraid of showing his impulsive rogue persona that village girls found so irresistible. Basically she's playing hard to get again hoping the old Mario will break through his gentlemanly facade to sweep her off her feet. Meanwhile Mario has gotten a hint from Niven that he should do this. Symbolicallythis happens in his forceful treatment of her during their duet a subsequent chase around the stage area and when he breaks through her locked dressing room. End of story. Yes Kathryn's character was a complicated and difficult woman to fathom which some reviewers interpret as bad acting. Not so!I found J Carrol Naish an entertaining and sometimes hilarious 'sidekick' for Mario providing comedic relief throughout along with the MarioKathryn unlikely pairing comedy. His character remained unimpressed with NO high society culturerefusing to be transformed by it as Mario had been. Naish had been incorporated into several of Fox's high profile Latinooriented musicals of the early '40s again as a somewhat humorous supporting character. David Niven retains his British upper class reserve and charm throughout as Kathryn's chaperon overseer and probable lover the alternative safe choice for Kathryn as a husband.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a variation on the much repeated love story in which a cloistered upper class girl must choose between marrying a safe but dull man of her class or a dashing Romeo rogue. Examples include some of MGM's most popular films of the '30s and '40ssuch as Gone with the Wind Captain Blood and The Adventures of Robin Hood as well as the poorly received musical The Pirate. In The Belle of New York Fred Astaire's character incorporates both of these elements. Thus the conflict for Vera Ellen involves trying to reformulate his character so as to bring out the best mix for herevery woman's fantasy!.That is also what this love story is aboutmaking a gentleman as well as a talented opera singer out of a boisterous rough hewn bayou fisherman with a golden singing voiceMario Lanza without making him too dull and unromantic.The film begins with the festivities surrounding the annual blessing of the fishing fleet of a small early 20th century bayou fishing village. Evidently the village mayor has contracted to have an opera starKathryn Grayson and her managerescortDavid Niven arrive for this festival. Mario spends too long looking at the beautiful Kathryn and grounds his uncle's boat so that they miss having it blessed with holy water a bad omen as things turn out. Mario wants to impress Kathryn the only way he knows how by impulsively joining in her song and later practically forcing her to join in the local folk dance. This makes Kathryn look foolish twice over. Is that any way to catch a woman of her upper class breeding? Certainly not but subsequent events might make her change her mind. After his uncle's boat is wrecked in a storm Mario reluctantly gives up fishing for a possible career as an opera singer.He is groomed as Kathryn's costar but only after he gets an education on how to behave around upper class opera patrons. His relationship with Kathryn ocillates from cold to warm and back. She is a very difficult woman to consistently please or figure out! Meanwhile they both do much singing solo and as a duet not actually a lot of heavy opera until the finale Madame Butterfly performance. At one point Kathryn asks the unemotional Niven to marry her apparently to resolve the conflict in her mind about how to respond to Mario's strong romantic overtures.Now for the very puzzling behavior of Kathryn during and after their Madame Butterfly love duet. Obviously she often looks very anguished and is trying to push Mario away during most of this performance in contrast to what she should have been doing. Some have interpreted this as the real Kathryn reacting to the real Mario reflecting her well known aversion to his advances toward her garlic eating and other rude behaviors between takes. I can't believe MGM would allow this to show so blatantly although it may have been a contributing factor. Rather I favor the following interpretation as being the dominant explanation Before this performance Kathryn as well as several of Mario's village friends complain that he has become too much of a gentleman afraid of showing his impulsive rogue persona that village girls found so irresistible. Basically she's playing hard to get again hoping the old Mario will break through his gentlemanly facade to sweep her off her feet. Meanwhile Mario has gotten a hint from Niven that he should do this. Symbolicallythis happens in his forceful treatment of her during their duet a subsequent chase around the stage area and when he breaks through her locked dressing room. End of story.

Mario's hitherto unknown comedic skills are a big surprise and the supporting cast of J Carroll Naish and David Niven is wonderful. I wish I could say the same for costar Kathryn Grayson but her shrill coloratura grating vibrato and minimal acting skills make her a poor match for Lanza.This is the film that introduced Lanza's signature song Be My Love. The scene in which the song is first sung as a duet between Grayson and Lanza is great fun to watch with both singers trying to outdo the other. The Madama Butterfly Love Duet scene is even better as Lanza throws caution to the wind and shows Grayson the true meaning of PASSION.Were it not for Grayson the movie would merit the highest evaluation. Despite this one casting flaw Toast of New Orleans is an excellent vehicle for newcomers to opera. Like the man himself Lanza's screen character's lusty ways and thorough lack of pretentiousness are a breath of fresh air and he sings impressively throughout. Highlights include the Libiamo much better than his commercial recording a gorgeous Bayou Lullaby and the aforementioned Butterfly Love Duet.Following this movie Lanza would go on to star in The Great Caruso the pinnacle of his movie career and the film that has influenced more singers than any other in cinematic history.".

He was a wonderful dancer in Oklahoma and the same in Toast of N.O. Rita Moreno went on to appear in The King and I Movie plus later as everybody knows as the older sister in movie West Side Story. She is still alive at 8182 years old and still looks very beautiful. James and Rita are excellent in Toast of N.O.J. Carrol Naish quite the funnyman. Accent a riot. Clothes totally ridiculous and wonderful. Table manners from he too funny for words. A shrimp expert LOL.Niven the staid proper Britisher not my idea of a romantic leading man. He was the onlooker. Didn't want to make marriage more important a career than opera. Kathryn actually had to ask HIM to marry HER. He was such a numbskull.Loved seeing the oldtime stage actor photographs on the walls and furniture. I recognized young Constance Collier. Pictures obviously of that era in theatre history. You see old theatrical performer photographs in other movies such as Yankee Doodle Dandy and Morning Glory. Constance Collier a stage beauty in early 20th century was the elderly resident in movie Stage Door starring Kathryn Hepburn and Ginger Rogers.Lanza when dressed up and gentlemanly reminding me of Enrico Caruso  the Homburg hat fancy morning coat etc. rotund body dark hair matine presence.

Noticed French Quarterlooking scene in this movie the lace balconies plus mattebackground church etc. Raspberries and plaintains for sale indeed. Lanza sang to everyone on the street.Clinton Sundberg tended to have secondary but important roles that seemed to tie the stories together. He did not have leading man looks but was gentle with the other characters.Some posters said Kathryn played an upper class society woman but I think if we look underneath the facade here was yet another of Niven's lower class discoveries who decided to fake her way into N.O. society. N.O. is rather sophisticated in some parts than some think compared to the fishingcommunity rustics as portrayed in this movie but I am sure that the Cajuns had a lot more sense than some of the city dwellers.Yes this was 50s moviemaking as some said. This was also 40s storytelling and YES it was postWorld War II  BUT give the movie makers credit for a sugar coated fantasy instead of the fightingandkillingWorldWarII movies that went on for decades afterward. You can imagine perhaps this movie was started in 1949 cast in 1948 storyboard 1946 ideas 19421943 during the ugliest part of the worldwide conflict. So stop whining and complaining and enjoy this wonderful escapist bit of fluff. RIP Kathryn Grayson who had one of the most beautiful singing voices in musical movies.The only thing missing here was tap dancing which as all of you know is my fave.

Lanza plays a bayou shrimp fisherman who lives with his nagging uncle J. Carrol Naish. He is a brash and verile lout until an opera director David Niven sees him singing and believes he is the tenor that his opera has been needing. Lanza's voice is ironed out through the company's training as are his brutish manners with the help of opera star Grayson whom Lanza has fallen for.

	schema:reviewBody "In The Toast of New Orleans Kathryn Grayson plays a beautiful opera singer with a beautiful soprano singing voice. As you can imagine she pulls it off wonderfully the problem with this movie has nothing to do with her performance. She's romantically involved with her manager the classy handsome wealthy supportive David Niven. So far so good. Enter Mario Lanzo a poor crude ignorant fisherman who happens to have been blessed with a natural singing talent. Now why would Kathrynwho has everything a woman could ask for in her career and relationshipbe drawn to Mario? That my friends is the problem with The Toast of New Orleans. If they wanted us to sympathize with her conflict they shouldn't have cast David Niven!To give her credit when Mario first imposes himself Kathryn wants nothing to do with him. He literally interrupts her singing with his own topping her high notes and singing as loud as he can without bursting a lung. However The Niv is intrigued by Mario's untrained talent and attempts to turn him into a genteel opera singer to match Kathryn. Some of the scenes are cute but the basic story just doesn't make any sense because not only is The Niv a class act but his character is written to have no flaws. If he's going to be as gorgeous in Technicolor as David Niven is he should at least be written with flaws as he was in Please Don't Eat the Daisies. The big song from The Toast of New Orleans is the lovely ballad Be My Love and while I'm not really a fan of Mario Lanzo's voice the duet he sings with Kathryn is pretty cute. If that's one of your favorite songs you might want to watch the movie that introduced it to the world. I've been overly harsh on this movie but it really isn't as bad as I'm making it out to be. If you like Kathryn Grayson or operatic singing you might like this cutesy musical.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Toast of New Orleans is a long way from perfect but anybody who loves opera and classical music and who is a fan of Mario Lanza will enjoy it a lot. As a lifelong fan of opera and classical music and who likes Lanza's voice a great deal The Toast of New Orleans was very enjoyable to me.As the review summary says it's mainly the music and the performance of Mario Lanza that makes The Toast of New Orleans worth viewing. The music is just glorious Be My Love became Lanza's signature song and not only is it a melodically beautiful song sung beautifully but it does stir up the emotions a fair bit. There are a number of operatic arias from the likes of Carmen and La Traviatatwo of the finest operas ever written and they are guaranteed to delight opera and musical fans. The Madama Butterfly duet scene is truly unforgettable. The music score is just lovely as well. Lanza as ever is in magnificent voiceone of the loveliest and most distinctive tenor voices ever and proves himself to be a very likable leading man his acting looking more comfortable than in his debut That Midnight Kiss.Kathryn Grayson is by no means inferior she radiates in charm and sings like an angel while David Niven is wonderfully suave and Rita Moreno turns up in a super dance number that's excitingly choreographed and exuberantly danced. The Toast of New Orleans also looks grand with lavish sets and bright colourful costumes and the whole film is very lovingly photographed. The script is appropriately witty and amusing and has a good deal of heart.Where The Toast of New Orleans is let down is in the story which again like That Midnight Kiss is silly and waferthin except that the story is even more predictable than the story for that film and occasionally drags I do agree that it's more an excuse to string as many operatic scenes together. J. Carrol Naish tries far too hard for laughs that he comes over as unfunny and obnoxious. Some of the more romantic scenes are a little cold as well the Madama Butterfly duet is just fine in this regard but Lanza and Grayson's chemistry in That Midnight Kiss from personal opinion was warmer and more natural.All in all a nice film and worth seeing for Lanza and the music. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " A great demonstration of what Lanza could and could not do well";
	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to dismiss this as a silly movie  which it is  and say that all that's worth paying attention to is the music which is not true in several ways.Yes the plot is silly. But it shows how Lanza could be presented to show off his most attractive qualities. Though he is already verging on the portly in some of the scenes and though he is more or less handsome depending on the angle from which he is photographed the fact remains that he comes across as a generally handsome guy with a lot of very powerful virility. That's not something to be dismissed lightly.There are lots of examples of that in the movie but perhaps the most obvious if also in certain respects the most troubling one is the last scene the performance of the love duet that closes Act I of Madama Butterfly. You have to forget that in the opera Butterfly is only 15 otherwise this comes across as very uncomfortable to watch. Grayson certainly doesn't look 15 though so what we have is a young naval officer who is clearly very eager you know the word to get his new wife into bed and who quickly subdues any efforts on her part to delay the wedding night. Modern productions of the opera make Pinkerton more nuanced and have to. Here the officer knows what he wants and he's not going to take no for an answer or wait for Butterfly to come around by charming her. It's a very powerful performance. Not perhaps the most faithful to the libretto but completely convincing. Lanza conveys an animal magnetism that is very powerful.The other aspect of Lanza that comes across very well is his singing of popular music. He really gets into it and he can sing it in a very natural and appealing fashion. Nothing makes this clearer than the first time he sings Be my love with Grayson. She starts out and she is NOT good. Yes the notes are fine. But she carefully enunciates every syllable and it sounds completely unnatural like an opera singer trying to sing pop but with no idea how to do so. Then Lanza joins her and you hear the difference. He enunciates clearly but the words sound completely natural. It's no wonder he was able to turn that into a major hit. What it shows is what MGM executives evidently did not understand Lanza had a magic when doing popular music. Later efforts to get him to do 1920s American operettas like the Student Prince which were far more formal took him out of what he could do very well.You see this in the several opera excerpts Lanza sings. He's formal and stilted in the Flower Song from Carmen where he is clearly working on getting the French right and he sings it all at one volume level which makes it much less interesting than other tenors' performances. When he sings O Paradiso in Italian from L'Africaine et M'appari again in Italian translation from Marta he is much more at ease. And he is downright firstrate in the Butterfly duet in the original Italian of course where it is very obvious that he knows just what every word means and means them.I don't have anything to add about the rest of the movie. Grayson is no favorite of mine. She's alright in the canary fluff that was still done in those days  O luce di quest'anima from Linda di Chamounix Je suis Titania from Mignon Ombre lgre from Dinorah. She's much less right in the excerpt from Lucia and not at all my cup of tea in Butterfly. She sounds as if she grew up listening to Lily Pons recordings but she's not as good.MGM should have paid closer attention to what did and did not work in this movie and given Lanza movies that played off his strengths and avoided what he did less well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Life in the Bayou for fisherman Mario Lanza comes to an end when an opera star and her agent Kathryn Grayson and David Niven visit for the annual blessing of the fishing boats and discover his untrained but classical singing voice. He's unaccustomed to life among polite society so he's a bit crude when introduced. Fame is only a song away with a few bumps along the way. This is basically a retread of That Midnight Kiss with Lanza in a fishing boat instead of a truck and in period costumes instead of modern dress. Ms. Grayson gives an extremely funny performance her eyes indicating hysterical disgust as he intrudes on her singing of Be My Love and later swings her around in a fiery dance. Niven's subtle performance suggests his character is totally amused by Lanza's lack of sophistication and how it puts the woman he loves in some precarious predicaments.This film is highlighted by the Tina Lina a production number sung by Lanza and danced by the people of the Bayou lead by Broadway dancer James Mitchell later All My Children's Palmer Cortlandt and future Oscar Winner Rita Moreno. She is a soft and lovely character not the spitfire usually associated with her although she brought a lot of femininity to West Side Story's Anita who was really only a spitfire when she danced. Pedro Armandariz as Lanza's father makes his stereotypical character a bit more likable by giving him a rough around the edge persona that is actually charming once you get used to him.There's also a very funny curtain call at the end where Grayson and Lanza engage in a chase around the stage front and back which seems a precursor to Grayson's later diva in Kiss Me Kate. My only issue with the film was its repeat of basically the same story as their previous one together and the quick ending that seemed to wrap up the story too abruptly and unbelievably.".

I kinda thought about suing them for torture. As this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor defenseless eardrums I felt instant strong pain envelop my entire being. That damn muscular vibrato can shatter Soviet tanks into tiny bits nevermind glass.Why didn't you switch the channel if you didn't like it? you might ask angrily. Fair point fair point... The answer is that I wanted to but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that I fell to the floor writhing in agony. With my last ounces of energy I tried to reach the remote but couldn't.A silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by Niven who then proceeds to pigmalionize him. Lanza is in love with asymmetrical Grayson but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up. This may seem like a rather thin plot but this noisy movie is so chockfull of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all. This movie is RELENTLESS. Forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with Slayer's Reign In Blood as in a South Park episode. Whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world it's all infantile  as if they were all 6 yearolds impersonating grownups. I can only envy people who find movies like this funny. It must be great being easytoplease what a world of wonder would open up to me if only I could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious gutbusting comedy. But let's examine this phenomenon the 50s musical. My best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more daydreaming idealists among us a glimpse into Utopia or Heaven depending on whether you're churchgoing or Lenin'stombgoing or at least very cheesy version of these fantasyinspired places. TTONO is more akin to a representation of Hell but that's just me. I don't seem to get musicals. People talk there is a story  but then allofasudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened! When you think about it musicals are stranger than any sciencefiction film.Worse yet TTONO my favourite type of pizza btw is not just a 50s musical but one with opera squealing. Opera is proof that there is such a thing as overtraining a voice  to the point where it becomes an earpiercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure. The clearest example of this travesty is when Lanza and Grayson unite their Dark Side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet. I tried lowering the volume. I lowered it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then 8. I ended up lowering it to a 1 which is usually so low that it's only heard by speciallytrained dogs and certain types of marsupials and yet I STILL could hear those two braying like donkeys!Take the scene in the small boat in the river. Danza starts off with one of his deafening brainkilling tunes and then... nothing. No animals anywhere to be seen. Even the crocodiles who are mostly deaf have all but left. If you look carefully you might even see the trees change colour from green to yellow in a matter of minutes. No this was not a continuity error it was plain old torture of the flora. And those trees were just matte paintings! Imagine how real trees would have reacted.The reason glass breaks when a high C is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency but because glass is only human  hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous selfexplosion. I can listen to the loudest least friendly death metal band for hours but give me just a minute of a soprano and I get a splitting headache.".

Then from 14 to 10. Then 8. I ended up lowering it to a 1 which is usually so low that it's only heard by speciallytrained dogs and certain types of marsupials and yet I STILL could hear those two braying like donkeys!Take the scene in the small boat in the river. Danza starts off with one of his deafening brainkilling tunes and then... nothing. No animals anywhere to be seen. Even the crocodiles who are mostly deaf have all but left. If you look carefully you might even see the trees change colour from green to yellow in a matter of minutes. No this was not a continuity error it was plain old torture of the flora. And those trees were just matte paintings! Imagine how real trees would have reacted.The reason glass breaks when a high C is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency but because glass is only human  hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous selfexplosion. I can listen to the loudest least friendly death metal band for hours but give me just a minute of a soprano and I get a splitting headache.";

This time Lanza is a shrimp fisherman who likes to and can sing Grayson is now a fullfledged opera diva who discovers him by chance and this time around just so we can't say 'not again' it's Lanza who falls for her and her that has an 'understanding' with David Niven as the impresario who gives Lanza a crack at Madame Butterly. In the previous film J.Carroll Naish scored as Lanza's father so for extra insurance he's here again but this time as Lanza's uncle. Subtle right. There was only one 'new' song in That Midnight Kiss so MGM put Sammy Cahn and Nicholas Brodzsy to work and they came up with Lanza's first million seller Be My Love albeit Grayson sings it first and then they duet. By 1950 there was probably just enough postwar hysteria sill hanging around to make this palatable.".

	schema:headline " based on a story";
	schema:reviewBody "Address Unknown is a 1944 film starring Paul Lukas which is based on a story of the same name by Kressman Taylor. It's directed by William Cameron Menzies best known as an art director and also stars Morris Carnovsky Peter van Eyck the later blacklisted Mady Christians and K.T. Stevens.The story concerns two German art dealers in San Francisco circa 1932 Martin Lukas and Max Eisenstein Carnovsky. It falls to Martin to return to Germany with his family to buy and ship art work back to the U.S. gallery. With him and the family is also Griselle Martin's son's van Eyck fiance who has acting aspirations and wants to work overseas.Martin becomes seduced by the new Germany under Hitler and becomes friends with a baron Carl Esmond who encourages him to break ties with his Jewish partner which he does. The baron also learns that Griselle who uses the last name Stone is Jewish. Griselle has a part in a play and the Nazis have forbidden certain lines to be spoken from the Beatitudes. Griselle says them anyway and outed as a Jew by someone at the performance she runs for her life. She makes her way to Martin's place where she is turned away.Martin starts to receive letters from Max that are written in obvious code giving dimensions of Picassos and having certain numbers substituted for numbers previously sent. The baron warns him that sending and receiving codes is illegal. Martin denies that he is receiving coded letters meanwhile begging Max to stop writing to him.The film is very well done in a film noir style and you can't go wrong visually with Menzies and with Rudy Mate on the camera. The shadows and camera angles are striking particularly in the play scene and when Martin is alone in his house toward the end of the film.

	onyx:emotionText "Address Unknown is a 1944 film starring Paul Lukas which is based on a story of the same name by Kressman Taylor. It's directed by William Cameron Menzies best known as an art director and also stars Morris Carnovsky Peter van Eyck the later blacklisted Mady Christians and K.T. Stevens.The story concerns two German art dealers in San Francisco circa 1932 Martin Lukas and Max Eisenstein Carnovsky. It falls to Martin to return to Germany with his family to buy and ship art work back to the U.S. gallery. With him and the family is also Griselle Martin's son's van Eyck fiance who has acting aspirations and wants to work overseas.Martin becomes seduced by the new Germany under Hitler and becomes friends with a baron Carl Esmond who encourages him to break ties with his Jewish partner which he does. The baron also learns that Griselle who uses the last name Stone is Jewish. Griselle has a part in a play and the Nazis have forbidden certain lines to be spoken from the Beatitudes. Griselle says them anyway and outed as a Jew by someone at the performance she runs for her life. She makes her way to Martin's place where she is turned away.Martin starts to receive letters from Max that are written in obvious code giving dimensions of Picassos and having certain numbers substituted for numbers previously sent. The baron warns him that sending and receiving codes is illegal. Martin denies that he is receiving coded letters meanwhile begging Max to stop writing to him.The film is very well done in a film noir style and you can't go wrong visually with Menzies and with Rudy Mate on the camera. The shadows and camera angles are striking particularly in the play scene and when Martin is alone in his house toward the end of the film. Well worth seeing for the art direction and cinematography alone.In the actual story Martin and Griselle have had an affair previously and Griselle is actually Max's sister. The joke painting that Martin sends back to San Francisco that Max tries to hide from a customer is actually a Picasso  I'm not sure that was made clear in the film.The action in this film Martin's turning etc. take place seemingly very quickly and don't come off as believably as in the book which is actually a series of letters.

	schema:reviewBody "This little film received Academy Award nominations for art direction and score and I have to wonder how it escaped a nomination for cinematography as well because this story does not have a great deal of action in it. Instead much is said through the vivid score and the masterful cinematography that renders the shadows that the Nazis cast often more menacing that the Nazis themselves.Not commercially available as far as I know this is a film that deserves rediscovery. The story opens on a celebration between two friends and partners in San Francisco. Martin Schulz Paul Lukas is returning to his home country of Germany along with his wife and four of his five sons. His partner Max Eisenstein Morris Carnovsky will meanwhile keep their art gallery going in San Francisco along with Martin's son Heinrich. Max's daughter Griselle is also going to Germany to seek out a career as an actress. Heinrich and Griselle are in love but have decided to delay marriage so that Griselle can pursue her career.Once in Germany Martin gets swept up into the building Nazi movement when he is befriended and flattered by the silvertongued Baron von Friesche who eventually convinces him that he should cut off all communication with his old friend Max because he is Jewish. When the Nazis come after Max's daughter Griselle when they learn she is Jewish Martin stands by and does nothing to help her allowing his old friend's daughter to perish at their hands and on his doorstep. However a society such as the Nazi's that is built on purity of opinion and constant suspicion can sometimes be cleverly manipulated to be an instrument of revenge. Thus by means of a very simple plan executed by someone in the U.S. Martin soon finds himself isolated and under suspicion of espionage  a prisoner in his own home as well of his own imagination of what will come next.I highly recommend this film as it is still relevant today especially from a psychological standpoint of how totalitarian movements start out by preying on the desperation of the many and the selfimportance of a few.".

Martin Schulz Paul Lucas and Max Eisenstein Morris Carnovsky run a successful art gallery in San Francisco Both are German immigrants and are close friends.

Eventually this hurts Martin's relationship with Max who is a Jew.Martin's seduction by the Nazis and the advantages they offer has similarities to John Halder Viggo Mortensen's character in the more recent Good. Both are weak men who are easily led and both turn their backs on a Jewish friend.Much of the plot of Address Unknown hangs on the letters that go backward and forward between San Francisco and Germany. As the film goes on we learn how powerful these communications are especially with the Nazi censors involved.Giselle's Jewish background puts her in jeopardy when she appears in a play. Interestingly the lines she speaks which offend the Nazi censors are actually the words of Jesus from the Book of Matthew.Address Unknown has a couple of scenes that really hit home with one that would have done Val Lewton proud and has an ending with a twist worthy of an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.Although heavily stylised the film highlights the persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany but Address Unknown was made in 1944 and the war didn't end until 1945. Films made during WW2 give an insight into what was influencing audiences at the time. Although the full extent of what had been going on in Germany didn't come to light until after the war Address Unknown shows that the plight of the Jews before and during the war was far from a complete mystery.The film is more restrained than some of the more strident films made during WW2 and it's somewhat abstract quality has prevented it dating all that much.".

When the first film debuted WWII was practically overwhereas films with similar themes such as Mortal Storm came out before the US entered the warand did a lot to turn public opinion against Nazi Germany. Heck in 1944 saying the Nazis were bad and repressive wasn't exactly controversial in the United Statesas we'd been fighting them for three years! The film begins in the 1930s. Paul Lukas and his wife and kids minus the oldest one are leaving the US and moving back to Germany. They also decide to take their goddaughter who is Jewish. Once there Lukas slowly turns from a nice family man to a Nazilover. In the process all sense of right and wrong seems to disappear from him. And when his beloved goddaughter is in trouble he refuses to help. At this point there is a neat twist in the film involving coded messages and revenge. I won't say more as it would spoil the film. Suffice to say that this twist gives the film a nice and fitting ending.The acting mood and story are all quite good and the film worth seeing. While not a great film it is clever and wellwrittenand a very good propaganda film to galvanize the folks at home in the war effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well this is a movie about Germany in the 1930s released in 1944 when Germany had already established its international identity. So it's no surprise that when Paul Lukas takes his family from San Francisco to Munich in search of some paintings to be sent back to his Jewish partner at their art gallery many of the Germans turn out to be swine.So it's dated and a few characters are stereotypes but it's not at all a stupid movie not a flag waver with the Nazi brutes waving pitchforks beating hell out of the racially impure and goosestepping down the cobblestone streets under swastikas. As a matter of fact there isn't a swastika in sight. No Nazi helmets either. A couple of Jewish windows are broken but that's the only violence we see.That and the cinematography and the twist at the end make it a little outstanding for what it is.It's a tragic story. The immigrant Germans Lukas and his partner Morris Carnovsky are the best of friends as well as partners in San Francisco. Lukas' son Peter van Eyck and Carnovsky's daughter K. T. Stevens put off their marriage so that she can accompany Lukas back to the Old Country and pursue her acting career. She's eager but van Eyck is desolate because he's deeply in love with her.Once in Munich Lukas finds the Old Country changed and is swept up in the Nazi movement  too quickly if you ask me. He takes a position in the bureaucracy and becomes stiff and distant. He cuts off communication with his Jewish partner and follows all the orders of the local authorities. When Carnovsky's daughter Stevens is pursued because she's Jewish and pounds on Lukas' door he turns her away. Shots are fired and she dies. But we don't see it. Like the trembling Lukas we just hear it through the closed door.

	onyx:emotionText "Well this is a movie about Germany in the 1930s released in 1944 when Germany had already established its international identity. So it's no surprise that when Paul Lukas takes his family from San Francisco to Munich in search of some paintings to be sent back to his Jewish partner at their art gallery many of the Germans turn out to be swine.So it's dated and a few characters are stereotypes but it's not at all a stupid movie not a flag waver with the Nazi brutes waving pitchforks beating hell out of the racially impure and goosestepping down the cobblestone streets under swastikas. As a matter of fact there isn't a swastika in sight. No Nazi helmets either. A couple of Jewish windows are broken but that's the only violence we see.That and the cinematography and the twist at the end make it a little outstanding for what it is.It's a tragic story. The immigrant Germans Lukas and his partner Morris Carnovsky are the best of friends as well as partners in San Francisco. Lukas' son Peter van Eyck and Carnovsky's daughter K. T. Stevens put off their marriage so that she can accompany Lukas back to the Old Country and pursue her acting career. She's eager but van Eyck is desolate because he's deeply in love with her.Once in Munich Lukas finds the Old Country changed and is swept up in the Nazi movement  too quickly if you ask me. He takes a position in the bureaucracy and becomes stiff and distant. He cuts off communication with his Jewish partner and follows all the orders of the local authorities. When Carnovsky's daughter Stevens is pursued because she's Jewish and pounds on Lukas' door he turns her away. Shots are fired and she dies. But we don't see it. Like the trembling Lukas we just hear it through the closed door. How many directors would give up a chance to underscore what doesn't need to be underscored just to give the audience some action and blood? It's a nice adult touch.There are a surprising number of such touches. Back home when Carnovsky and van Eyck receive a brief formal letter from Lukas informing them that Stevens is dead Carnovsky slumps in his chair.

	schema:reviewBody "Let's face it even Woody Allen has gotten stale setting up laughs using the stereotypical Jewish dysfunctional family is there an oxymoron in that description?.  It's been done so many times.  The welcome surprise is that director and writer Greg Pritikin takes this old kreplach in place of chestnut and makes it work with a novel theme brought to life by a terrific cast.Adrien Brody made this movie before his Oscarwinning portrayal of a gifted Jewish musician in The Pianist.  Here he is a young man Steve whose lifelong ambition he's bordering on thirty is to become a ventriloquist. He buys a dummy and takes lessons Brody who passed fairly well as a concert pianist in his better known film actually did all the dummy tricks and ventriloquism here.Steve lives at home with his mom Jessica Walter who is forever shoving food at everyone.  His dad Ron Leibman is retired and he pursues a common hobby of men no longer gainfully employed making scale model warships while watching hard core porn.  Sister Heidi Ileana Douglas dreamed of becoming a singer.  Her ambition crushed largely by her scatterbrain mother she is now a wedding planner her first big job creating agita in the first degree. She's pursued by a clearly insane former fiance to her distress.Steve's closest friend from high school days is rock singer Fangera Milla Jovovich who has a cum laude Master's in Public Crudity.  Their relationship is platonic and Fangera is very albeit crazily devoted to her longtime buddy. Desperate for work for herself and her band she passes herself off to Heidi as a klezmer specialist exactly what the despairing wedding planner needs for her first big event.  Of course she knows nothing about klezmer music and her immersion in studying that genre is a riot by itself.  So is the payoff at the wedding.Steve fired from his job meets employment counselor Lorena Vera Farmiga and sparks of all kind begin to fly.  Lorena is a single mother with an adorable little girl and she's both attracted to Steve and shy about a commitment.  Their relationship which begins with a weird approach concocted by the barely sane Fangera rolls back and forth and is kind of touching.No need to say more about the plot.  This fastpaced romantic comedy works with all the principal cast members playing off each other in an often funny and occasionally serious and meaningful way.  Surprises are few but when has a ventriloquist's dummy been central to story development in any recent film?The special features on the DVD are fun.  Included is an interactive test in which the viewer answers a series of questions and then finds out what kind of dummy he or she is.  I was ranked a ...hey that's my personal business.There's also a storyboard history of ventriloquism which points out that this entertainment form allowed decades ago a performer to say things through his dummy that would have been unacceptable directly from his mouth including negative comments about politicians.As usual reading the credits closely paid off.  The technical adviser was Paul Winchell and the assistant technical adviser...Jerry Mahoney.  I think you have to be from my generation to appreciate that.810".

TV Guide Online critic Maitland McDonagh described this quirky youngadultscomingofage comedy as repetitive and obvious but somehow endearing like a truly ugly dog with sweet eyes and I pretty much agree with her assessment.  This Long Islandbased story of a pair of twentysomething siblings still living at home with their annoying critical parents Jessica Walter and Ron Leibman are so convincing as Mom and Dad it's scary! while trying to find their respective paths to independence could have been shrill and tiresome and at times it teeters dangerously close to being so.  Luckily the superb leads bring a gentle noncloying sweetness and poignancy to their performances that makes you keep watching and rooting for them.  That's saying quite a bit when you consider that the road to fulltilt adulthood for brother Steven Brody involves honing his ventriloquism skills Brody learned ventriloquism for his role and he does a good job!  I wonder if Brody drops such acquiredforarole skills once the movie wraps or if he keeps them honed just for fun? with a rather unnerving unnamed dummy not to keep digressing but with such rare exceptions as Charlie McCarthy aren't most ventriloquist's dummies rather unnerving?  as he woos Lorena his employment counselor enchantingly played by Vera Farmiga who's got issues of her own.  Highstrung sister Heidi Illeana Douglas is trying to forge a career as a wedding planner but she's got her work cut out for her what with an inept stalker exfiance Jared Harris dogging her every move her first major professional assignment turning out to be a Jewish wedding where the bride insists on klezmer music and not owning her own car the scenes where Heidi has to beg their mom for the car are both funny and painful. Adding to all this anxietylaced wackiness is Steven's high school pal Fangora ne Fanny Milla Jovovich an aspiring punk rocker and allaround nutty chick who claims she can play klezmer music so she'll get the wedding gig as well as giving Steven wellmeant but questionable advice on how to win Lorena's heart such as spraypainting a message on Lorena's front door. Fortunately in writerdirector Greg Pritikin's world even restraining orders and omnipresent ventriloquist's dummies can't block the path to love and happiness for long and everyone gets what they deserve.  Brody and Douglas are particularly wellcast with their attractively angular faces almondshaped green eyes and overall air of angst they make very convincing siblings.  Jovovich is hilarious especially in the running gag where she and her punk band practice their klezmer numbers.  Between DUMMY and ZOOLANDER it's clear that Jovovich has a flair for comedy.  I hope she gets more chances to keep her funny side up!".

Fortunately in writerdirector Greg Pritikin's world even restraining orders and omnipresent ventriloquist's dummies can't block the path to love and happiness for long and everyone gets what they deserve.  Brody and Douglas are particularly wellcast with their attractively angular faces almondshaped green eyes and overall air of angst they make very convincing siblings.  Jovovich is hilarious especially in the running gag where she and her punk band practice their klezmer numbers.  Between DUMMY and ZOOLANDER it's clear that Jovovich has a flair for comedy.  I hope she gets more chances to keep her funny side up!";

I kept walking past it at the video store and finally decided we HAD to watch a movie about pursuing a dream of being a ventriloquist.That being said it is definitely one of my favorites of the past few years and definitely my favorite comedy. If you're considering renting it and you like Wes Anderson I think this is a film you would enjoy.The cast is spoton and Adrien Brody as Steven is fall out of your seat AMAZING. It doesn't hurt that he's got excellent material to work with. His tone is so understated so perfectly introverted as Steven and so wry and cutting as the dummy...you truly feel that you are watching two actors playing two characters. It makes the moments the dummy is unanimated quite wild and almost eerie. To boot this movie is actually quite a good romantic comedy which in my humble opinion is usually an oxymoron. Steven's pathological shyness and abuse at the hands of his own dummy really made my heart ache even as my sides were splitting from laughter. Its hard to believe its the director's first film. Again all the actors particularly Brody and Douglas and Jovovich certainly holds her own as well go a long way in making it work. It is disappointing to see the lack of attention this movie has gotten. I hope it becomes a video sleeper. It is definitely worth renting...more than once!".

As the camera moves in on the young man we see in his eyes the depth of his dreams and aspirations to at last make something of his humdrum life. The next day he gives up his 9to5 job and announces to his dysfunctional family that he wants to be a ventriloquist. His everbusy motherJessica Walter making yet another tuna sandwich remarks that his career choice is nice but not very realistic while his sister observes that with the dummy on his lap Steven looks like a child molester.Casting is right on the mark. Adrien Brody brings a sympathetic and likable quality to the role of Steven as he manipulates his dummy to express his own private fears and feelings to the people around him. Vera Farmiga the love interest  is extremely engaging as his employment counselor and Illeana Douglas the very unmarried sister is constantly funny. Outstanding too is Milla Javovich as Steven's best friend a punk rocker with layers of attitude.

It takes real love for the staff to help the other children treat them with the kind of respect they need to show their proper talents.

I ask this because this effort is an example of independent filmmaking at it's worst because it's trying to gain an audience by going the easy route of being predictable. Story is about a totally pathetic loser named Steven Adrien Brody who's 28 and lives with his parents and one day decides to quit his loser job and become a ventriloquist.SPOILER ALERT Steven has one friend in the kooky and quirky Fangoria Fanny Gurkel Milla Jovovich who when she's not supporting Steven's job changes also sings in a garage band. Steven buys a dummy and practices at home which not only irritates his parents but his sister Heidi Illeana Douglas as well since she lives at home too. Steven goes to a temp service to try and get gigs as a ventriloquist and his case worker turns out to be a very pretty woman named Lorena Vera Farmiga and it takes some hard urging by Fanny to get him to talk to her. Even though Lorena had to call the cops on Steven for spray painting a message on her front door she eventually starts to date him but eventually it dawns on her that a relationship with someone like him wouldn't work out.This is only the second feature from writerdirector Greg Pritikin but you can't help but think he's made this for the sole reason of trying to get the attention of the Hollywood studios. On one hand his script is lukewarm and has has nothing special going for it but on the other hand Pritikin shows that as a director he can make a dumb romantic comedy as bad as the major studios can...and continue to do so! Everything in this script fails to be believable and the socalled romance between Brody and Farmiga is ridiculously preposterous especially considering the fact that she had to call the cops on him for his stupid shenanigans. Brody's character reeks with the term stalker but this film wants the audience to believe that not only would she date him but continue to laugh and giggle at everything he says! Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli had more chemistry on screen! With the exception of a few films Jovovich has been in more bad movies than I care to talk about and you can add this effort to her already laughable resume and one has to wonder if it's just poor choices or just accepting what little is offered to her. This film sat on the shelf for awhile until Brody won his Academy Award than it was released briefly in a few theaters blink and you missed it to try and cash in on his new found success but this is one of those half baked efforts that fails on practically every level.".

How come the guy with the gun shoots the three leads and gets away with it no one knows that the gun just has blanks in it so it's definitely a crime and then the story just goes on to what the director might have thought might be a funny bit of irony by setting him up with the terribly overacting Milla this guy should have been in jail the character that is.

I had not much of an expectation about this film and after seeing it I just felt like I had wasted a couple of hours I do not know what happened to the scrawny longnosed fella who acted in The Pianist but he sure is not in this one one can also checked him out in The Village Shyamalan's last fiasco a film in which not only the plot sucks but Mr. Brody manages to make his retarded character idiotic beyond belief I mean you gotta see it to believe it his acting is so lame.

Her character is something like a female Beavis  Butthead rolled into one but with great character development and evolution which pays off with her riveting singing performance at the story's climax. Her scenes alone which some appreciative youtubers have strung together for our enjoyment are worth the price of admission.Not to be overshadowed is Adrian Brody who plays a nerdy ventriloquist whose only friend is Milla. And in case you're wondering yes he operated the puppet and did all the ventriloquism himself according to the credits at the end.The story a nerdy ventriloquist wannabe Brody who is living at home at age 30something because he can't keep a real job pairs up with his high school pal Jovovich to chase his dreams and simultaneously win the love of a girl he's stalking. The humor is that the two of them Brody  Jovovich play characters who are so socially stunted that they'd be lucky if they could ride a bus downtown let alone achieve their dreams of glory. By the way Milla's dream is to be a punk rocker but she keeps getting waylaid by the fact that her guitarist can never seem to get the right reeearweewbreeerwoow that's a quote. Until they switch to a bizarre new music genre which I won't spoil you just gotta check it out and you WON'T be disappointed.There's a simultaneous subplot involving our hero's sister played by the hilarious Illeana Douglas who is a failedsingerturnedweddingplanner also living at home at age 30something whist being stalked by an alcoholic accountant who does community theater in his spare time.Perhaps you've figured it out from my description this is a film about people who have failed in various degrees to achieve their dreams and now solidly rooted in mediocrity they make their way through life on the line of sanity. And frequently tripping over said line.Dummy is a true gem of quirky excellence. The comedic timing between Brody's subdued character and Jovovich's hyper manic character is impeccable. Not to mention other supporting characters like the mother father and of course Brody's love interest who each play memorable roles that contribute greatly to the humor. Dummy is an all round solid comedy that deserves a respectable cult following. Definitely not a wooden performance. Har har.".

The conceit is that he finds his voice through a ventriloquist dummy he buys. The dummy is the most believable character in the whole movie. I suppose the dummy expresses innate talent and thoughtfulness that Brody always had inside but I thought Brody's character was so stupid before and after the dummy that I couldn't believe that he was anything but a village idiot. I am left with questions not the good pondering kind but the what the hell kind. Most of the characters are one note and one dimensional and have no connection to how people act. It seems as if the director was looking for a Wes Anderson kind of feel with a bit of David Sedaris acid thrown in. But both Anderson and Sedaris have an emotional intelligence and character believability no matter how wacky the situations they contrive are. In this film I never felt like there was any real growth with the characters. Please save yourself some time and a couple bucks don't rent this.".

I guess when you're a kid everything on the big screen is impressive.Humor helped in this film giving it some life here and there as it's a bit slowmoving but still entertaining. I've usually found Curtis entertaining to watch a man who played a lot of interesting characters. I still think he iswas an underrated actor too. It was nice seeing the main character although being a fake still asking for God's help in certain situations inside knowing he was not doing the right thing. Those parts would be edited out if the film was remade today. I agree too with a fellow reviewer that faking being a surgeon is not something to be laughed at especially if he was doing his operating on you or me!".

He's supported in this true story of a man who wouldn't settle for the humdrum by a wonderful cast of Hollywood players.This film is particularly personal to me because I knew a Ferdinand Waldo DeMara character in my life. This person was not a great impostor like Curtis plays in this film but like DeMara was amazingly bright and was a quick study. Even though he didn't have a high school diploma just like Fred DeMara like DeMara with study he could learn enough to do anything. Unfortunately in the span of his life on earth all he did was use his brain was to con the social service system. And like Karl Malden's priest confidante to Tony Curtis I told him he could do so much more with his life. Tony Curtis's performance is spoton for me.I have to say that my favorite moment in the movie is when DeMara is finally unmasked and we see a series of reaction shots of the various people he's fooled. Most of the facial expressions are of shock but Raymond Massey who plays the Abbott of a Trappist Monastery reads the newspaper and has a grin that is priceless.Recently Leonardo DiCaprio did a similar film and Catch Me If You Can did not take as lighthearted an approach as The Great Imposter. But the two should be viewed side by side for comparison. Leo's Frank Abegnale is also spoton but I think I like Tony Curtis's performance a tad better.Maybe because this film is so personal others might not see it as I do but I give it the best rating around.".

Great for him but everybody else is deprived of the place in line that they've earned.  Very amusing to see DeMara in all these highstatus positions  doctor researcher from Yale prison warden monk. Suppose he'd killed someone on the Canadian destroyer?  It doesn't help that he looks heavenward and mutters God please don't let me kill anybody. He should have thought of that before.  And his settling down with a straightforward love of his life who reforms him is unbelievable.That gets the bad stuff out of the way.  Tony Curtis is near his best jaunty when it's called for sweaty and nervous when necessary.  His meeting with Mickey Kellin in the dark prison cell is pretty spooky.  We can believe that Curtis is scared.  We can also believe that Kellin is anxious to cooperate in some scheme that saves both his neck and his face. The scene in which Curtis as a Canadian doctor must remove the abcessed tooth of Captain Edmund O'Brien could not be improved upon.  I can't watch that scene without busting up.  O'Brien frozen in this awkward position an agonized expression on his face like an exhibit in Madam Toussaud's Wax Works.  I'm glad he finally got caught before he caused too much damage.  Speaking of the damage we don't see much of it here.  It's all pretty lighthearted which is one way of approaching exploitation.  An example of what I mean by damage.  I would feel sorry for the Naval officer who falls in love with him and redeems him if she existed.  In real life these stimulushungry antisocial personalities are easily bored.  They tend to attract women use them and blow them off.  I would expect DeMara to have left a lot of hurt women along his madcap trail.".

There is also a good deal of talent in the cast.Luckily 'The Great Imposter' turned out to be exactly that exactly what it seemed it would be on paper. It was interesting and it was very entertaining the latter being especially strong those two being its main objectives and they were achieved. Won't say it was a masterpiece or classic cinema because it wasn't not everything works but like Curtis one cannot be too hard on 'The Great Imposter' with so much working in its favour. It knows what it wants to be who to aim it at and shows a lot of effort without trying to bite more than it can chew or play it too safe. Would have liked DeMura's motivations to have gone into depth more or properly exploredexplained this aspect felt underdeveloped.Also didn't buy his reform which felt rushed and too pat to me but that's personal opinion.On the other hand 'The Great Imposter' looks attractive especially in the photography and is assuredly directed. The music is never intrusive lowkey obvious or repetitive it fits well and not hard at all to remember.While the facts and subject are adapted loosely and the tone significantly more lighthearted compared to the biography of which it is a loose adaptation of the lighthearted wit is infectious it doesn't get too camp or silly and those unfamiliar with the man and story before seeing the film will find themselves wanting to learn more. The story is crisply paced and while odd in places in an appealing way it doesn't get too hard to follow. The surgery scene is priceless and avoids the trap of falling into distaste do agree though it is not a subject to be laughed or poked fun at usually.Did worry as to whether Curtis would be able to handle multiple roles and whether he would pull it off but didn't need to be. He does splendidly here we have as much fun as he clearly did and one can really see how much he grew as an actor from when he first started a decade or so before. Raymond Massey Edmund O'Brien and Karl Malden are particularly noteworthy in support. All in all lots of fun. 810 Bethany Cox".

Crichton's  The Great Imposter and viewing the movie it becomes quite obvious that the movie only loosely follows Demara's actual charades and exploits. As a matter of fact several of scenes in the movie 1 The manure farmer police car chase was fictitious 2 Demara also impersonated Dr. Robert Litton French as a Professor of Philosophy at Gannon University 3 As Dr. Cecil Boyce Haman a candidate for first year law courses at Northwestern University Law School 4 Demara also enrolled in 10 Catholic monasteries across the county under assumed identities using forged documents. He either quit because they were catching on or he could not endure the physical and spiritual demands of that order 5 His impersonation in the Royal Canadian Navy was that of Canadian Harvardeducated Dr. Joseph Cyr whose complete academic records and personal history he acquired when they were fellow brothers at the Brothers of Christian Instruction in Maine. Demara was known then as Brother John.The sad irony of Demara's life was that he had the intellect to adapt learn survive and prosper in the systems and roles he assumed. He actually did the jobs perhaps equally to or better than the individuals he impersonated because he actually believed he had more to prove to substantiate his value and authenticity. He actually gave more in dedication effort and work to improve the jobs and positions he impersonated than he took.Demara believed he was fighting against an unfair unjust and discriminatory system which starting point judged a person not by their intellect personal motivation character or ability to do the job... but solely upon their academic credentials. Demara believed that if you played by the rules you either died as a hero or lived long enough to see yourself become a villain. That the only sensible way to live in this world is without rules. Demara's impersonation of Surgeon Lt. Joe Cyr of the Royal Canadian Navy was the high point and greatest challenge of his persona. He learned in 4 months reading medical books the equivalent of 5 years of medical school. He could read surgical procedures memorize and repeat them to perfection on the operating table.His greatest disgrace was being uncovered after he completed 19 consecutive life saving surgeries on severely injured Korean War commando team members when his meritorious actions were broadcast across the entire Canadian and American news media spectrum. Equally devastating was his loss of Lt. Nursing Sister Catherine Lacey whom he deeply loved and intended to marry after resigning his commission from the RCN upon his return from Korea.Demara died at the age of 60 a miserable lonely and broken man who never got over loosing Catherine...who had only himself to blame.".

	schema:headline " The man of many IDs careers and escapades";
	schema:reviewBody "The Great Imposter is one of the most unusual stories ever put on film. Based on a 1959 book by the same title it's a true story about a man of many identities and many professions. Ferdinand Waldo Demara Jr. lived from 1921 to 1982. From the time he was a teenager he lived the lives of some 30 different people. Most of them were borrowed IDs from real persons living. And in most cases he assumed their careers or credentials which enabled him to pursue another career. This movie is a fictionalized account of Demara's many IDs and positions before he was 38 years old. Tony Curtis gives a good performance of Demara who was a physically large man. But Curtis portrays well the character of Demara who was an extrovert with a very upbeat personality. The movie shows many of the real escapades that Demara had  all that are shown here actually happened. And there were many more. This movie is billed as a comedy and drama but it also ranks as an adventure and maybe even a mystery of sorts. It's not a crime story but lingers around the edge. Demara is close to a con man yet he doesn't do anything to rob steal or gain money from someone else. He doesn't really have victims but his guises are a type of caper in which he fools an entity or institution in order to get a position. With all of this I think Demara's story itself and this film also are something of a satire. They get in jabs at the government education system institutions and various professions where they build on credentials. Here was a man who had the Ph.Ds. and accolades behind his assumed names but who hadn't earned those honors and yet could do the job or hold down the position whatever it was. This is a fine film and one that everyone should enjoy. The full story about Demara makes great reading. For those who would like just a condensed version of more of his background I provide the following.Demara did spend 18 months in a U.S. Navy disciplinary barracks for desertion but otherwise never was tried or convicted of any crime or wrongdoing. That probably was due to the nature of his forged or faked IDs. He never took on a new position for money or stole or robbed from anyone. He lived on the money he was paid for the various jobs he had under the various IDs. In several of his assumed IDs he made significant contributions. But how could he take on so many diverse careers successfully? He had a photographic memory and could quickly read and easily memorize textbooks. He supposedly had an exceptionally high IQ. Asked later in life why he didn't just use his skills to advance as himself Demara said that he was just being a rascal. He left school and ran away because it was too slow. He liked the adventure and challenge of each new thing. He was interested in many things. None of it ever was harmful. Much of it was in helpful and in humanitarian fields. Among the many careers or positions he worked in most under his fake assumed IDs were several in the medical field education and social welfare. Before his Canadian Royal Navy service as a surgeon he was trained as a Navy corpsman medic was a sanitarium orderly and a psychologist. He was an elementary school teacher taught at two different colleges and founded a college that today is Walsh University in Canton Ohio. He entered and tried Catholic religious orders including time as a Trappist monk a Benedictine monk and a member of the Christian Brothers that run schools. Demara worked as a counsellor at the Union Rescue Mission in downtown Los Angeles. He received a graduate certificate from Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland Oregon and for a time was pastor of a Baptist parish in that state. In his last years he was a visiting chaplain at Good Samaritan Hospital of Orange County in Anaheim California. He befriended many people over his life including the owners of the hospital. He was allowed to live there and died of heart failure due to diabetes. Demara served as a prison deputy warden as a sheriff's deputy and as a lawyer. Other guises and jobs he had were as a civil engineer an editor a cancer researcher and a childcare expert. His is almost a fairy tale story of many escapades.It's only natural to compare this story and film with that of Frank Abagnale Jr. and the 2002 movie Catch Me if You Can. But there is a big difference between the two characters. Abagnale was a true con artist who set out to make millions of dollars by dishonest means. Demara was a genius who wasn't driven for money but by curiosity many interests and a sense of adventure that led him to try many fields. As I noted he was on the edge but he never pursued a scam operation to cheat or steal from or hurt anyone else. I don't understand why one might see this film as a bad influence for children. With proper discussion one can point out the good things Demara tried to do. And then tell children they should try them the right way. Or does anyone think that there are thousands hundreds or even dozens of such genius personalities and with such abilities among the young today? If there have been up to the late 20teens they haven't gotten very far. Or there surely would be more than one such story.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Great Impostor is quintessential Tony Curtis. Curtis was never an exceptional screen actor but a decent one probably more for his good looks and charisma than his ability to become different people. He is in the category of what I call charisma actors. I would include Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in the same category. Charisma actors are talented and can be very convincing given the right role. And this was the right role for Curtis.The Great Imposter tells the true story of Ferdinand Waldo Demara Curtis who was chronicled in a novelistic book of the same name written by Robert Crighton who also wrote The Secret of Santa Vittoria. Demara assumed different identities such as a monk a sheriff's deputy and notably a prison warden usually without the expected credentials. Probably the exploit he is most known for which brought him both recognition but exposed his chicanery was becoming a ship's surgeon for the Canadian military during the civil war in Korea. And he didn't have a medical degree!Curtis was perfect casting as Demara. He makes his character fun and likeable. The real Demara was somewhat heavyset unlike Curtis. However Curtis captures the essence of Demara's likability which was probably the reason for his success. The real Demara found ways of inserting himself to situations without alienating or threatening those already there. While the movie exaggerates a little bit the outcomes of some of Demara's ventures it's a fun and thoroughly entertaining film. Not one which will go down in the annals of the greatest movies ever made but it holds its own. A must for Curtis fans.".

And he didn't have a medical degree!Curtis was perfect casting as Demara. He makes his character fun and likeable. The real Demara was somewhat heavyset unlike Curtis. However Curtis captures the essence of Demara's likability which was probably the reason for his success. The real Demara found ways of inserting himself to situations without alienating or threatening those already there. While the movie exaggerates a little bit the outcomes of some of Demara's ventures it's a fun and thoroughly entertaining film. Not one which will go down in the annals of the greatest movies ever made but it holds its own. A must for Curtis fans.";

Is he a compulsive snake? one who must periodically shed his skin because he needs new types of challenges periodically to avoid boredom? Or is he playing a cat and mouse game periodically testing whether he can once again beat the system in assuming the identity of someone else? I suspect some of both. Unlike as shown in the film he actually joined a monastery for several years when he ran away from home at age 16. I would think it extremely unusual for a restless teen to do so. I think that should tell us something about his psychological state.There is always the problem of a few people who meet the bureaucratic requirements for a profession or advanced schooling but lack real life competency vs. those who are or show promise of being quite competent but lack the bureaucratic criteria for being accepted as an advanced student or as a professional.The film dramatizes only a few of Demara's impersonations albeit some of the most astounding. His attempt to reform the typical brutality in prisons was one highlight. However his masquerading as a doctor in the Canadian Navy during the Korean war is the most unbelievable segment. Included is his historical surgery on several wounded Koreans while aboard ship.I wonder if he had gotten married if he would have settled down? The fact that he tried to make it as a monk in his early adulthood may suggest that he didn't have marriage in his plans. Incidentally Sue Anne Langdon sure was cute and vivacious as an aggressive man eater!Demana is shown faking a suicide. This really happened.I'm very surprised that this film was shot in BW at this late date1961 although Universal was a notoriously cheap studio.".

All in all  this film is predominantly an Italian film rather than a Spanish one . It's an ItalianSpanish realization  two country coproduction but is clearly dominated by the Italian contingent and the traditional leanings of the Spanish producers of the time have their stamp on the entire proceedings .

'Dynamite Joe' is a relatively obscure film except that the full film is on Youtube and it just aired on Movies4Men just now.Watching it via the latter with little else to do 'Dynamite Joe' turned out to be an okay onetime watch particularly if one is a Spaghetti western completest and wants to see even the obscure ones but is easily forgettable and doesn't have enough to warrant repeat viewings. Not awful by all means you can do with so much worse but there is not much explosive here let alone enough to live up to its title.'Dynamite Joe' does have its good things. It's not bad looking it's evocative in design and has the right amount of rustic grit and much of the photography is lovely especially the opening shot. The music fits quite well sometimes rousing and at other times subtle it's not the most lushly orchestrated score in the world but it at least is not discordant with the setting. The songs are catchy.There are moments of amusing comedy and occasional exciting action.On the other hand both the direction and pace are pedestrian especially in the fartoolongtogetgoing first half and the story is far too ordinary and seems reluctant to give any tension imagination or conflict. Instead it tries too hard to be lighthearted and ends up playing it too safely and politely.Regarding the script some amusing comedy aside it lacks lustre as well and doesn't flow naturally. The characters are little more than bland indifferent in development clichs and the acting is nothing to write home about. Rik Van Nutter sleepwalks through the lead role and the rest are either bland or overthetop.In summation okay but forgettable very soon after watching. 410 Bethany Cox".

The tone was completely at odds for what we have come to expect from these types of films with a central character who doesn't have deadly gun skills but instead is a dab hand with a stick of dynamite! Despite or maybe because of these distinctive characteristics Dynamite Joe is a mediocretopoor western. It's essentially about a government agent who is tasked with protecting a gold shipment from bandits. His weapon of choice is needless to say explosives.This one was helmed by jackofalltrades director Antonio Margheriti who made films in many different genres. He does solid enough work here but the material is just a bit too tedious for its own good. The star actor is a guy with the spectacularly silly name of Rik Van Nutter. Seemingly he was the guy who played Felix in the early James Bond movies although I would never have known if I hadn't read it here on IMDb. Overall this is a film that certainly doesn't take itself very seriously but at the same time it isn't very good either.".

Set right after the carefree roaring 20s during the early days of the Great Depression Dance Fools Dance is at its heart an earnest cautionary tale with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times. Yet this fastpaced and tightlyplotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale.In the 30s Hollywood had a knack for churning out one entertaining and enlightening audiencepleaser after another all without wasting a frame of film. Dance Fools Dance  one of four films that Harry Beaumont directed in 1931  is barely 80 minutes long yet its characters are well developed its story never seems rushed and despite its many twists in plot the audience is never left behind.With the lone exception of Lester Vail as flaccid love interest Bob Townsend the supporting cast is uniformly strong. Worthy of note are William Bakewell as Crawford's brother Cliff Edwards best known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket as reporter Bert Scranton and Clark Gable in an early supporting role as gangster Jake Luva.But this is Joan Crawford's film and she absolutely shines in it. Made when she was just 27 this lesserknown version of Crawford will probably be unrecognizable to those more familiar with her later work. However here is proof that long before she took home an Oscar for Mildred Pierce Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself.Score EIGHT out of TEN".

As others have already mentioned it is historical for being the initial teaming of Joan Crawford and Clark Gable although Gable is sixth or seventh billed at this point. Don't expect Gable the gallant cad in this one  here he is pure cad.The film is largely an unremarkable morality tale about the follies of the very wealthy spoiling their children even into adulthood to the point where they complain about having to get up in the middle of the night 9 AM to eat breakfast. which are the sentiments of the two Jordan children. When Wall Street crashes dad dies from the shock and Bonnie Jordan Joan Crawford and her brother are left penniless. Bonnie chooses to break into newspaper reporting but her brother chooses a less honest option which brings him into contact with Gable the gangster. After her close friend reporter Bert Scranton Cliff Edwards is shot to death Bonnie decides to go undercover as a dancer at Gable's nightclub to try to get to the bottom of the murder. She solves the crime but at great personal cost.The best parts of this film are watching Joan Crawford in a dance number and watching the great chemistry Crawford and Gable have together. You get bigger doses of Crawford and Gable together in Possessed which was made later this same year  1931. Joan Crawford was already a big star at this point. As for Clark Gable he has to wait until he manhandles Norma Shearer in A Free Soul before he catapults to true stardom.".

The height of adventure and success for Joan is a yacht party where she boldly talks everyone into skinny dipping well stripping down to their underwear out on the ocean.The father dies and it turns out he's broke the picture turns to chapter two or How will the spoiled kids survive? Well the brother finds work with a bootlegging mob and Joan gets a job as a cub reporter. Influential friend of the family helps her out apparently...no she's not remotely qualified but shows a knack for the work right away! Rather quickly the brother finds himself over his head in the sordid business of bootlegging...and Joan eager for a real story instead of the tea parties she's initially assigned to takes on....you guessed it the mob.There's more to it than that including Joan's sometime boyfriend Lester Vail who halfheartedly offers to marry her when her fortune goes kaput and hangs around when she sets off to make her own success and Cliff Edwards as the veteran reporter who mentors Joan at the paper but hears too much for his own good at a speakeasy.Clark Gable is riveting as boss gangster Jake Luva premustache the swagger is already there. His first scene features a cigarettelighting routine with girlfriend Natalie Moorhead excellent in a tiny role as the soontobe discarded moll he blows smoke in her face she blows out his lighter and they hold a stare for a lingering shot that speaks more about their characters' relationship than any of their dialog even attempts.Midway through the story you have a pretty clear idea of where the plot is going to go.but the second half of the picture is still livelier than the first at least the characters have some purpose in the second half. Crawford is especially good she is always at the center as the picture revolves through her relationships with the various men in her lifelover brother mentor gangster.Joan also gets in one good danceundercover as a chorus girl she sees her former rich kid friends in the audience and really puts on a number.No classic as far as plot goes or dialogbut worth seeing for Crawford's performance.Research question How would a 1931 movie audience have been impressed by spoiled rich girl Crawford flashing an electric hair dryer?".

She also was paired for the first time with Clark Gable.

The reviews Gable got made Louis B. Mayer scrap all the footage that had been shot with Brown and Gable was immediately recast in that picture.Crawford and William Bakewell play a couple of rich kids whose father William Holden loses everything in the Crash of 29 and dies from the shock of it. And I mean he lost everything as the mansion and its furnishings are auctioned off to pay all the debts the estate owes. Both of them have to go to work Bakewell not all pleased with that prospect.Joan goes to work for a newspaper writing sob sister stuff and she proves she has a knack for it. Bakewell on the other hand gets a job with your friendly bootlegger and his boss who is Clark Gable.At this point the film makes use of the real life incidents of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and the murder of reporter Jake Lingle in Chicago who covered the gangland beat. Cliff Edwards who plays the reporter does an excellent job possibly the best acted part next to Gable. Playing opposite Crawford as her ever faithful boyfriend from the good old rich days is Broadway actor Lester Vail. I looked Vail up on the Broadway Database and he had considerable stage career. He did not do too many films and truth be told he did not register well as a screen presence. No wonder all the talk was about the few scenes Gable and Crawford had together when she went undercover to investigate the murder of her friend and colleague Edwards.Though it goes over the top in the melodrama toward the end Dance Fools Dance was a significant milestone in the careers of two screen legends.".

She finds a job as a reporter and her brother a job as a bootlegger with the mob. Newcomer Clark Gable plays the head of the mob. Trouble happens and kid brother talks then sister comes running to help though she has to deal with Gable first. This is the movie that put Gable on the map. It would be the first of nine films they would star together at MGM. The storyline is typical but Crawford and Gable made it good. The supporting cast is good as well. This was Lester Vail's first filmthough he only made four more. William Bakewell playing the brother was funny when he was telling Bonnie to become a runway model and did that strike a pose! Hello!!I would recommend this film to anyone who wants a glimpse into Crawford's early work.".

Before he became a star at the end of the decade with Gone With The Wind Gable played a lot of sleazy roles himself early in the '30s. This is another where he's a gangster Jake Luva. He's modeled in here after Jake Lingle a reallife gangster from the period who was involved in the famous St. Valentine's Day Massacre.Anyway he and his sister Bonnie played by Crawford go from prosperous to penniless when the stock market crashes in 1929 and their dad is ruined. He had been financing them.Jake then goes the crooked way and Bonnie goes straight as a reporter. This is was very clichridden and the story was used in similar situations throughout films of the 30s and '40s often with childhood pals going in opposite directions.If you are a classicera film buff this movie will interest you.

	schema:reviewBody "Dance Fools Dance 1931  out of 4 Fun PreCode has a father dropping dead when he learns that he's lost everything in the stock market crash of 1929. His daughter Joan Crawford and son William Bakewell have no money and never had to work a day in their lives until now. She goes to work as a reporter for a newspaper while he gets involved with a gangster Clark Gable and soon all three are going to collide. DANCE FOOLS DANCE is a mustsee if you're a fan of the starts or just this era in history. I always enjoy watching these early films from the 30's because you just never really know what type of wildness you're going to get. The film starts off at a society party where all the young adults decide to go swimming even though there's not enough bathing suits. The entire stuff dealing with the stock market crash was obviously still very hurtful to most in 1931 so many films from this era used it for starting point on a plot. I thought the film was extremely entertaining thanks in large part to the excellent performances with Crawford leading the way. She gets to play a rich society brat a hardworking reporter and an undercover gangster's girl and she does a very good job with all three. Gable is also excellent as the gangster and there's just no question about it but he and Crawford just had a certainly magic to all their films together. Bakewell is good as the brother and there's nice support from Cliff Edwards and Lester Vail. I'm not going to ruin the ending but it's certainly a great one and something that Tarantino would likely do nearly seventyyears later. DANCE FOOLS DANCE is a must see for fans of the genre and there's no question the stars are in good form.".

His daughter Joan Crawford and son William Bakewell have no money and never had to work a day in their lives until now. She goes to work as a reporter for a newspaper while he gets involved with a gangster Clark Gable and soon all three are going to collide. DANCE FOOLS DANCE is a mustsee if you're a fan of the starts or just this era in history. I always enjoy watching these early films from the 30's because you just never really know what type of wildness you're going to get. The film starts off at a society party where all the young adults decide to go swimming even though there's not enough bathing suits. The entire stuff dealing with the stock market crash was obviously still very hurtful to most in 1931 so many films from this era used it for starting point on a plot. I thought the film was extremely entertaining thanks in large part to the excellent performances with Crawford leading the way. She gets to play a rich society brat a hardworking reporter and an undercover gangster's girl and she does a very good job with all three. Gable is also excellent as the gangster and there's just no question about it but he and Crawford just had a certainly magic to all their films together. Bakewell is good as the brother and there's nice support from Cliff Edwards and Lester Vail. I'm not going to ruin the ending but it's certainly a great one and something that Tarantino would likely do nearly seventyyears later. DANCE FOOLS DANCE is a must see for fans of the genre and there's no question the stars are in good form.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know if fans of Aurania Rouverol's Andy Hardy will take to this offering from their favorite author with the same degree of enthusiasm. For this time Andy  brilliantly played by William Bakewell in the standout performance of a career stretching from 1925 to 1955  is a drinksodden goodfornothingbutevil wastrel a killer who shoots down a friendly acquaintance in cold blood in order to save his own miserable hide. Sis superbly interpreted here by Joan Crawford is likewise a spoiled brat of uncertain virtue who realizing the emptiness of her callow society friends changes her thinking when forced to fend for herself instead of living off her dad. Yes like Judge Hardy dad is a bit of a philosopher. His credo is Do the other guy before he does you! Dad is most realistically brought to life here by William Holden. His death scene is utterly convincing. In real life Holden himself died on March 3 1932. But I'm neglecting two of the finest players in the movie namely Cliff Edwards and Clark Gable. Edwards is ingratiatingly deft as the star reporter who worms information out of Bakewell whilst Clark Gable is a powerhouse of corrupt fascination in this first of his eight movies with Joan Crawford. The nominal hero of this picture Broadway actordirector Lester Vail rates as the weakest star of the lot. Even minor character players like the exotic Natalie Moorhead as Gable's moll sly Russell Hopton a cagey thug and blonde belle Joan Marsh a jealous socialite easily outshine the staid and stagey Mr. Vail. Fortunately despite his second billing his appearances in the action are astonishingly brief.Underrated Harry Beaumont has astutely directed with wonderful pace and an admirably polished style whilst the shimmering photography realistic art direction and flattering costumes are well up to the classy standards we expect of MGM. It's a surprise to find that this seems to be Aurania Rouverol's only screenplay. A Family Affair the introductory Andy Hardy was based on a stage play. She's darn good. Her dialogue and characters are really alive.In short powerful if grim entertainment. I was going to add with a happy ending but the idea of Joan being saddled with a stodgily repentant Mr. Vail is maybe not all that felicitous. This movie is now available on an excellent Warner Archive DVD.".

Joan does a very lively dance to Accordian Joe  much to Sylvie's disgust. The film ends with a gun battle and as Rodney lies dying Bonnie tearfully phones in her story.This is a super film with Crawford and Gable giving it their all. Natalie Moorehead who as Sylvie shared a famous cigarette scene with Gable early in the film was a stylish other woman who had her vogue in the early thirties. William Bakewell had a huge career he had started as a teenager in a Douglas Fairbanks film in the mid 20s. A lot of his roles though were weak spineless characters. In this film he played the weak brother and was completely overshadowed by Joan Crawford and the dynamic newcomer Clark Gable  maybe that was why he never became a star.Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "DANCE FOOLS DANCE MetroGoldwynMayer 1931 directed by Harry Beaumont is not a movie starring The Three Stooges participating in an all night dance marathon nor is it a musical starring the comedy team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey. Oddly enough this is only a title though there are some dancing sequences involved but not enough to categorize this as a musical. Overall this is a Depressionera story that opens with high society party followed by newspapernewsroom melodrama before shifting to the its popular genre of the time a crime story. With the leading players being Joan Crawford and Lester Vail by the time the movie reaches its conclusion at 82 minutes the names of Joan Crawford and Clark Gable immediately come to mind for their first onscreen collaboration together.The story opens with a society party on a yacht hosted by socialite Bonnie Jordan Joan Crawford. Bonnie is loved by Robert Townsend Lester Vail but she prefers her carefree lifestyle with her rich friends as opposed to becoming his wife. After the Stock Market Crash of 1929 which results to a fatal heart attack on Bonnie's father Stanley William Holden. leaving both Bonnie and her spoiled younger brother Rodney William Bakewell paupers. With most of their personal possessions sold at public auction andf dismissing their servants Rodney refuses to take the family lawyer Selby's Hale Hamilton advice by going to work. As for Bonnie she breaks away from her former high society lifestyle and friends by getting an apartment in the Chicago district and working for a newspaper under her editor Mr. Parker Purnell Pratt. Rodney however gets in with the wrong crowd where his friend Wally Baxter Earle Foxe introduces him to Jake Luva Clark Gable nightclub owner bootlegger and tough crime boss. When Bonnie's reporter friend Bert Scranton Cliff Edwards gets shot down by one of Luva's gang for learning too much about his organization Bonnie is assigned to go undercover as Mary Smith from Missouri to not only work as a dancer at Luva's cabaret but to gather enough information to convict Scranton's killer. While her assignment goes well as planned Bonnie eventually learns too much for her own good. Others in the cast include Natalie Moorehead Della Joan Marsh Sylvia Russell Hopton Whitey and Sam McDaniel.While DANCE FOOLS DANCE is early Crawford at best it's also early Gable sans mustache treating 'em rough and giving all the orders. After entering the scene 36 minutes into the story Gable no doubt gathers the most attention in the story as both villain and aggressor trying to get Crawford's Bonnie to be nice to him. William Bakewell resumes his typecasting in his usual cowardly rich brother more concerned about what his father left him in the will as opposed to his death. He spends much of the time smoking and drinking and learning the hard way that crime does not pay. Lester Vail whose name comes second after Crawford's is definitely a forgotten name in cinema history. The only thing to recommend for his performance is that his role might have worked to better advantage had it been played by the up and rising Robert Montgomery.

	onyx:emotionText "DANCE FOOLS DANCE MetroGoldwynMayer 1931 directed by Harry Beaumont is not a movie starring The Three Stooges participating in an all night dance marathon nor is it a musical starring the comedy team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey. Oddly enough this is only a title though there are some dancing sequences involved but not enough to categorize this as a musical. Overall this is a Depressionera story that opens with high society party followed by newspapernewsroom melodrama before shifting to the its popular genre of the time a crime story. With the leading players being Joan Crawford and Lester Vail by the time the movie reaches its conclusion at 82 minutes the names of Joan Crawford and Clark Gable immediately come to mind for their first onscreen collaboration together.The story opens with a society party on a yacht hosted by socialite Bonnie Jordan Joan Crawford. Bonnie is loved by Robert Townsend Lester Vail but she prefers her carefree lifestyle with her rich friends as opposed to becoming his wife. After the Stock Market Crash of 1929 which results to a fatal heart attack on Bonnie's father Stanley William Holden. leaving both Bonnie and her spoiled younger brother Rodney William Bakewell paupers. With most of their personal possessions sold at public auction andf dismissing their servants Rodney refuses to take the family lawyer Selby's Hale Hamilton advice by going to work. As for Bonnie she breaks away from her former high society lifestyle and friends by getting an apartment in the Chicago district and working for a newspaper under her editor Mr. Parker Purnell Pratt. Rodney however gets in with the wrong crowd where his friend Wally Baxter Earle Foxe introduces him to Jake Luva Clark Gable nightclub owner bootlegger and tough crime boss. When Bonnie's reporter friend Bert Scranton Cliff Edwards gets shot down by one of Luva's gang for learning too much about his organization Bonnie is assigned to go undercover as Mary Smith from Missouri to not only work as a dancer at Luva's cabaret but to gather enough information to convict Scranton's killer. While her assignment goes well as planned Bonnie eventually learns too much for her own good. Others in the cast include Natalie Moorehead Della Joan Marsh Sylvia Russell Hopton Whitey and Sam McDaniel.While DANCE FOOLS DANCE is early Crawford at best it's also early Gable sans mustache treating 'em rough and giving all the orders. After entering the scene 36 minutes into the story Gable no doubt gathers the most attention in the story as both villain and aggressor trying to get Crawford's Bonnie to be nice to him. William Bakewell resumes his typecasting in his usual cowardly rich brother more concerned about what his father left him in the will as opposed to his death. He spends much of the time smoking and drinking and learning the hard way that crime does not pay. Lester Vail whose name comes second after Crawford's is definitely a forgotten name in cinema history. The only thing to recommend for his performance is that his role might have worked to better advantage had it been played by the up and rising Robert Montgomery. Natalie Moorehead as Jake Luva's toughblonde mistress has the film's most notable scene where Jake Luva blows cigarette smoke in her face followed by her blowing out the fire of the lighted match held on Luva's hand.

	schema:reviewBody "Dance Fools Dance begins with a party onboard on yacht in which the younglings jump off the boat for a late night swim in their underwear while the older men are ignorant of a possible fall in stocks and the idea of forthcoming great depression the last days of the carefree roaring twenties seen through the lens of 1931.Bonnie Jordan Joan Crawford and her brother Rodney William Bakewell are young glamorous people who never worked a day in their life and show no resentment for it either from a father who doesn't want his children to have the hard time he had. They don't exactly mourn over the death of their father but the loss of their fortune following the stock market crash is the tragedy which gets a reaction out of them. Regardless Bonnie deals with the loss of their fortune surprisingly well and accepts the fault of being left nothing from their father because she and her brother didn't finish school. This is the crux of the character and what makes her interesting. She doesn't choose the easy way out of getting married to a wealthy man even though the opportunity comes to her but rather desires the thrill to make it on her own as she herself later puts it.I don't believe many people are aware of just how endearing Crawford was in her younger preshoulder pad days. In Dance Fools Dance she exemplifies a workingclass heroine with an aura of refreshingly simple straightforward bravery which really makes you route for her character plus there is the joy of watching her flex her dancing talents.Clark Gable is a mere 5th on the cast list even William Holden no not that one is higher than him but his introductory scene is hard to forget. The downbeat piano music as one of his servants puts a blazer on him as he then blows smoke in a woman's face tells you everything you need to know without a spoken word. Likewise Bonnie's brother Rodney is a memorable character himself as someone who is shocked by the criminal underworld where his alcohol came from before the depression after taking his supply of booze for granted for so long. Likewise the other great cast member is Cliff Edwards as Bert Scranton who makes for an endearing comic sidekick and mentor to Bonnie.Dance Fools Dance isn't quite a great film its concept could be fleshed out and explored to a greater degree and would have been ripe for a remake and maybe a title that wouldn't sound like something a James Bond villain would say. Although even at that despite the film being imperfect it would still be hard to top with that endearingly creaky early 30's precode charm.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER This movie should be but hardly ever is judged on its own merits as opposed to as a remake of His Girl Friday an The Front Page. It is a fast paced movie full of twists and turns and political satire that I still find hilarious and edgy. Part of what makes it work is that the story takes place at a Chicagobased cable news network. The newspaper which was regarded as the most uptodate medium in The Front Page is mocked by news anchors as primitive while they check their makeup.Kathleen Turner is Christine Colleran the tough news anchor with a conscience Burt Reynolds hilariously plays Sully her exhusbandboss who unscrupulously scouts stories while being badgered by the Ted Turneresque head of the network to put on more smutless fires. Christopher Reeve plays Christine's onedimensional yuppie fiance Blaine Bingham. Henry Gibson makes a surprising turn as the timid Ike Roscoe who is on death row for killing his son's drug dealer who happened to be an undercover cop.The story revolves around Roscoe's execution the gungho Attorney General Ned Beatty wants Roscoe executed so he can win the upcoming Governor's election. The Governor a Reaganesque Charles Kimbrough wants to pardon Roscoe so he can win the election. TV reporters are scrambling like rats around a carcass looking for a hot and preferably exclusive scoop. The only people who seem concerned for Roscoe himself are Christine and Roscoe's attorney girlfriend Pamela derisively referred to as the conscience of America.Meanwhile Sully is trying to stop Christine from quitting the news business so she can live with Blaine in New York. First Sully has his interns book all New Yorkbound flights leaving within the next 24 hours. Then he has Blaine subjected to strip searches and sends the acrophobic Blaine to a skyscraper with a glass elevator. Then Sully tries one last tactic to seduce Christine back into the news business and subsequently back into his life to have her do one last interview with Ike Roscoe. It would bring in monster ratings and oh yeah it might get the guy pardoned or whatever.And if you're looking for a history lesson watch Christine talking to Blaine on her cell phone.".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILER This movie should be but hardly ever is judged on its own merits as opposed to as a remake of His Girl Friday an The Front Page. It is a fast paced movie full of twists and turns and political satire that I still find hilarious and edgy. Part of what makes it work is that the story takes place at a Chicagobased cable news network. The newspaper which was regarded as the most uptodate medium in The Front Page is mocked by news anchors as primitive while they check their makeup.Kathleen Turner is Christine Colleran the tough news anchor with a conscience Burt Reynolds hilariously plays Sully her exhusbandboss who unscrupulously scouts stories while being badgered by the Ted Turneresque head of the network to put on more smutless fires. Christopher Reeve plays Christine's onedimensional yuppie fiance Blaine Bingham. Henry Gibson makes a surprising turn as the timid Ike Roscoe who is on death row for killing his son's drug dealer who happened to be an undercover cop.The story revolves around Roscoe's execution the gungho Attorney General Ned Beatty wants Roscoe executed so he can win the upcoming Governor's election. The Governor a Reaganesque Charles Kimbrough wants to pardon Roscoe so he can win the election.

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone can make any sort of commentary on how this film didn't live up to its heritage as the umpteenth remake of the movie His Girl Friday or the original The Front Page but in this case I prefer to take the film on its own merits especially in light of how things have been since its release.First of all no one has to get on a soapbox and talk about how the chief supporting actor of this film Chris Reeve has been in the time since its release. The movie Speechless with Mike Keaton and Geena Davis in my opinion stands as a much better reference point if one is looking for one for Mr. Reeve's work before his accident. Instead I like to look at his role in this as seeing how he was moving away from his Superman stereotype. The man has worked with some of Hollywood's A  B list leading men over the last twenty years ranging from Michael Caine to Morgan Freeman. While he was no Ralph Bellamy in this film I don't recall anyone saying he was supposed to be when the film was made. After all he was only supposed to play the type of character Ralph played in the earlier remake and if they had wanted Ralph's nod on the film Especially since he was the only surviving castmember why didn't they get him to play the Network Owner's part?Then there is Burt Reynolds' character. While I don't think they gave him the best lines they could have in some scenes I felt and still feel that he played the part of the Station Managerexhusband in a role that was not out of range for him. However if you want to sit there and compare him to Cary Grant's role I ask that you do one thing before you do so. Go out and rent His Girl Friday and then fast forward to the scene where Cary goes Oh Walter! and then try to imagine how easy it would have been to get Burt to do that scene in the same way.Finally but in no means last there is the heroine of the movie played by Kathleen Turner. Ms. Turner has always played capable women who can be independent when they need to be and continued to do so here. One scene of note in this movie is her reaction to the story about kazoo players and the President of the United States at the beginning of the film. When you consider the fact that Hollywood has repeatedly told us that modern broadcast journalism's motto is if it bleeds it leads and they seem to be living up to that on the local news broadcasts I as a viewer would want the person giving me the news to crack up on a story about Kazoo players long before they ever did about someone going postal at a Luby's Cafeteria.The point in the movie where one can draw a strong similarity between the original remake and this one begins in the the interview at the prison. The scene here does not play out as a remake of the same lines and dialogue as the original said by new people and one does have to admit that you can't exactly go in too many different directions with that as part of your storyline.Also in my opinion the story does demonstrate much more detail about one thing that the GrantRussell movie only touched on. There is a changing of the guard going on in the business. The older seasoned journalists in the main story have or are changing positions. Sully has moved on to Producer and is now fighting a constant battle over lead stories rather than deadlines. An example of this is where he makes the comment to his boss in jest about having a team going all over Chicago looking for Smutless fires. Christy is also following the grass is greener principle as she is leaving SNN for a job as morning anchor in New York a show with a Willard Scotttype weatherman and fake furniture.In my opinion the only ones who really weren't welldeveloped as well as they could have been were Ned Beatty and Charles Kimbrough's characters. While it was interesting to see a man who would later go on to play a television journalist in a long running TV series Kimbrough was Jim Dyle on Murphy Brown the portrayal of them as a simpleminded Governor and a crookeddealing DA both running for governor seemed to me to be a mixed message over which story should have been covered. Everyone likes a good political debate but at what cost or should that be whose cost?".

The Broadway playand first film adaption with also talked about bloviating politicians who campaignon law and order. If anything it's worse now.Howard Hawks saw the possibilities in The Front Page as a boygirl romance bymaking the original role of the reporter as a woman. What he got was one ofmy favorite Cary Grant films. Switching Channels is a remake of His Girl Fridayand the roles Cary Grant Rosalind Russell and Ralph Bellamy played are nowdone by Burt Reynolds Kathleen Turner and Christopher Reeve. And of courseReynolds is now a news producer Turner his ace reporter and Reeve the handsome rich doofus she wants to marry.Again it's an outrageously corrupt Ned Beatty playing the Cook County DistrictAttorney who primarying the ineffectual Governor of Illinois Charles Kimbrough. He got a conviction on Henry Gibson for murdering a cop andhe's looking to see that as Gibson burns in the electric chair he can become governor and more. Kimbrough is the kind who takes a poll before he goesto the bathroom. But Gibson escapes on the night he's to die and sets off awhole chain of events in which elected officials are toppled romance getsredirected and corruption exposed.It is fascinating how on track Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur were when they wrote The Front Page. We could remake it again updating it with internet journalism without too much of a change in the plot.Start thinking of who could be the stars in yet a 21st century remake of thisclassic.".

And of courseReynolds is now a news producer Turner his ace reporter and Reeve the handsome rich doofus she wants to marry.Again it's an outrageously corrupt Ned Beatty playing the Cook County DistrictAttorney who primarying the ineffectual Governor of Illinois Charles Kimbrough. He got a conviction on Henry Gibson for murdering a cop andhe's looking to see that as Gibson burns in the electric chair he can become governor and more. Kimbrough is the kind who takes a poll before he goesto the bathroom. But Gibson escapes on the night he's to die and sets off awhole chain of events in which elected officials are toppled romance getsredirected and corruption exposed.It is fascinating how on track Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur were when they wrote The Front Page. We could remake it again updating it with internet journalism without too much of a change in the plot.Start thinking of who could be the stars in yet a 21st century remake of thisclassic.";

Part of what makes it work is that the story takes place at a Chicagobased cable news network.  The newspaper which was regarded as the most uptodate medium in The Front Page is mocked by news anchors as primitive while they check their makeup.Kathleen Turner is Christine Colleran the tough news anchor with a conscience Burt Reynolds hilariously plays Sully her exhusbandboss who unscrupulously scouts stories while being badgered by the Ted Turneresque head of the network to put on more smutless fires.  Christopher Reeve plays Christine's onedimensional yuppie fiance Blaine Bingham.  Henry Gibson makes a surprising turn as the timid Ike Roscoe who is on death row for killing his son's drug dealer who happened to be an undercover cop.The story revolves around Roscoe's execution the gungho Attorney General Ned Beatty wants Roscoe executed so he can win the upcoming Governor's election.  The Governor a Reaganesque Charles Kimbrough wants to pardon Roscoe so he can win the election.  TV reporters are scrambling like rats around a carcass looking for a hot and preferably exclusive scoop.  The only people who seem concerned for Roscoe himself are Christine and Roscoe's attorney girlfriend Pamela derisively referred to as the conscience of America.Meanwhile Sully is trying to stop Christine from quitting the news business so she can live with Blaine in New York.  First Sully has his interns book all New Yorkbound flights leaving within the next 24 hours.  Then he has Blaine subjected to strip searches and sends the acrophobic Blaine to a skyscraper with a glass elevator.  Then Sully tries one last tactic to seduce Christine back into the news business and subsequently back into his life to have her do one last interview with Ike Roscoe.  It would bring in monster ratings and oh yeah it might get the guy pardoned or whatever.And if you're looking for a history lesson watch Christine talking to Blaine on her cell phone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Andi Ommsen ist der letzte Lude is a German 85minute film from over 10 years ago and it is another example of German comedians trying to be actors. Many have done it in the past but almost none of them came up with a quality movie. This is also why I am particularly surprised that Lotto King Karl managed this difficult feat. Maybe the reason is that he did not try himself to be a writer or even director here and let these jobs do the professionals while all he had to focus on was the acting. I do not believe he is a trained actor so this was certainly enough of a challenger. He succeeded and his character and performance were quite fun to watch from start to finish. Actually he is a lot better than Tobias Schenke who once again proves that he has basically no talent. At least he is not as bad in comedy as in drama. But there is something hilarious to the fact that he had a scene when he was instructed to play a bad actor and there is really some massive irony to that moment.I believe the main reason why I liked this film quite a bit is not only that it almost never took itself seriously but because the writing was genuinely funny on many occasions. This comedy may have been scenes that were nothing new and that we have seen in similar manner in other films already but that was not a problem as the writers surely had good taste in what scenes they decided to include here. I quite liked their approach and it managed to keep weak actors like Neldel or especially Schenke from ruining the movie. There is a lot of political incorrectness in the film. They are not afraid of swearing for example or being obscene. There was only one moment when it was disappointing and that was the farting humor scene. But at least this one somewhat made comedic sense with the tattoo reference that explains it all. As a whole this was a good watch. Thumbs up to Lotto King Karl and the makers of this film here. Quite a positive surprise and I recommend checking it out. This film is evidence that German films can be funny. Go StullenAndy! I'd probably even have watched a sequel if there was one.".

Caught in the middle between the two are among others top industrial designer Patricia Foster who officially is on May Fortune's payroll after being fired by Femina and Christopher White a suave Brit who also is officially on May Fortune's payroll as Cutter's right hand man. On the surface Patricia is still working for Femina trying to steal the new top secret formula for a water repellent hairspray developed by Dr. Stuart Clancy for May Fortune that hairspray which would make all other hairsprays obsolete while Christopher secretly tries to stop her. Below the surface it is not clear whether either Patricia or Christopher truly are working for May Fortune Femina or someone else.

	schema:reviewBody "A SUPER title for a film!  Many have slammed this film.  Doris Day detests it and will NOT talk about it.  Why?  It's polished sexy and stunningly filmed by Leon Shamroy! I believe this was his last film although I may be mistaken. I agree that the plot was not exactly 007.  But put it up against many of today's films and it's a fine body of work in many ways albeit not in all ways.  I personally do not think that Richard Harris was a good choice as a leading man for Doris Day. In 196667 my uncle was a longshoreman in Long Beach.  He was also a rough rugged actorstuntman in action films.  He was doing something at Twentieth Century Fox and I asked him about Caprice.  Could he get me in to see them film?  So he went to the publicity department to get me some stills from the days shooting.  Which he did.  They were never officially released by Doris nor her husband.  I felt fortunate to get both of them.  The day came when he was taking me to the set where they were filming what he was working on and we would visit Caprice.  I skipped school and everything!  Doris Day had fell filming and pinched a nerve in her back.  She was in traction for quite awhile.  They told us that they may have to scrap the film if she couldn't get back to work on it soon.  I walked all around the sets. Remember the Eiffel Tower?  They were really lush and that bed suspended from those big chains really swungI sat on it inspite of the signs I couldn't resist!.  I just a kid was really impressed by it all.  Martin Melcher spared nothing.  It was lush!  The interior of the jet was cool as well.  At the end of the day my uncle was able to get us a peek into Doris' bungalow at TCFox.  WOW!  They had great houses for their stars on the lot.She had great clothes in the wardrobe area for the film.  I remember how cool they all looked so perfectly maintained for filming.  I particularly remember that pink hat she woreI thought it was ugly.  There were two of them as I recall. And several Platinum wigs.  She refused to dye her own hair that color so the hair dresser Barbara said.  I felt like a fly on the wall around there.  The sets all said HOT SET DONT TOUCH ANYTHING! I didn't.  I felt VERY privileged.Caprice was also Doris Day's last commercial recording on the Columbia label for whom she recorded her entire recording career.  It was a single that received good airplay on stations around the world that played easy listening stuff back then.  It certainly wasn't as good a recording as Move Over Darling!  For instance they LOVED it in Portugal and Spain!  The single was released with a high quality picture sleeve there!  It's nothing to rave about but lush and rich just like the film Caprice.Hope you enjoy these memories of mine.".

But when I saw the film at Radio City Music Hall the audience seemed to enjoy it.The opening credits were very clever and there was a spectacular beginning to the film a ski chase with the villain in black and the victim in white getting shot to death.Doris Day was dressed in mod attire and gave her usual professional performance.  The plot was the film's biggest problem.  It was very complicated and it takes two or three viewings to grasp everything.Richard Harris was a good choice to play opposite Miss Day. He later said that even though he didn't like Caprice he was delighted to work with Miss Day a true expert in the comedy field.  He stated that he learned more from her about comedy than he could have learned in years at the Royal Academy.  Nice words.This picture could have been good if they had cut several scenes.  I liked the rapport that Miss Day had with Edward Mulhare in their scenes together. She also worked well with Lilia Skala Ray Walston and Jack Kruschen.  There was a funny bit which Doris played with Michael J. Pollard in a movie theatre that was showing Doris Day and Richard Harris in Caprice.Doris Day is a natural actress.  She uses props well and approaches her material from a realistic standpoint.  You believe her even when she is thrusted in the most unbelievable situations.  Miss Day was very good near the end of the picture when she confronted Ray Walson in drag and then Edward Mulhare who sent her on an unexpected helicopter ride.There were some exciting scenes especially the one when Doris is being chased down the slopes by the man who killed her father in the beginning of the film.  The resulting rescue was directly out of the old '40s cliffhangers.It has become fashionable to dismiss Caprice but if you are a Doris Day fan you might enjoy it if you can ignore some of the cuteness director Frank Tashlin threw into the plot.".

Admittedly it is not high art or even subtle but it is an engaging spy romp in true '60's fashion with Doris and Richard Harris exhibiting nicely judged performances. They make an excellent team and look well together. Richard Harris is admittedly not renowned for comedy roles but the character of Christopher is surely meant to be rather sinister. The script makes certain that we don't know whether to trust him or not. I think his is a very underrated performance. The fashions and makeup are truly of the period and there are some very exciting and funny setpieces. I'm all in favour of films like Caprice which set out to entertain and I will certainly watch this film again and again.".

They make an excellent team and look well together. Richard Harris is admittedly not renowned for comedy roles but the character of Christopher is surely meant to be rather sinister. The script makes certain that we don't know whether to trust him or not. I think his is a very underrated performance. The fashions and makeup are truly of the period and there are some very exciting and funny setpieces. I'm all in favour of films like Caprice which set out to entertain and I will certainly watch this film again and again.";

Having experienced Hawaii and about fifteen minutes of Camelot at which point I puked and felt it unadvisable to risk my health by watching any more I have always thought of him as irritating and gross. For some reason I ate him up in this role though.  The movie thankfully finds a number of opportunities for him to lose his shirt which is a blessing.The plot however is a mess.  Not only does it become impossible to follow who the characters are working for and what they are trying to do it even becomes difficult to discern what city we are in at any given time the action veers back and forth between Paris and L.A. with some scenes in Switzerland thrown in and certain sequences on a plane flying God knows where.  It mainly held my interest until the stupid ending which is like a kick in the face to anyone who has devoted an hourandahalf of their life to this movie.  Halfway through it becomes a whodunit except with no suspects and the resolution is even less satisfying than you fear it's going to be.I would also like to have a few serious words with Doris's hair and makeup designers... She looks like a 45yearold who thinks she's still 20 and it's not a pretty sight.  Her wigs are way too light and her dark eye makeup and layers of false eyelashes border on the grotesque.  It's almost astonishing to see her in the shower scene because she looks so natural and charming and it's quite a contrast to the borderlineMaeWestinMyraBreckinridge look she is going for during the rest of the picture.I don't know whose idea it was to have Doris go see the movie Caprice starring Doris Day and Richard Harris and then to have her voice singing the film's title song when she gets in the movie theatre. But it wasn't funny it was just disconcerting and bizarre.  For a minute when they first showed the marquee I thought it was going to turn all meta and reveal that everything up to then had just been scenes from the movie and we would now commence with a story of the real Doris Day and Richard Harris.  But no such luck.  The scene in the movie theatre did at least provide the film with its best performance by Michael J. Pollard.Final note... I now have the first two notes of the title song stuck in my head.  I can't remember any other parts of it but I am sure Doris will be singing Caprice in her coy annoying way inside my brain for many days to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "MASTER PLAN steal a formula for water resistant hairspray. The director and star of The Glass Bottom Boat returned for another stab at comical intrigue. This one starts as a seemingly serious thriller about someone getting killed on the snowy Alpine slopes and others involved in some sort of espionage in Paris the ski chases even precede the ones in the James Bond thriller On Her Majesty's Secret Service69. But we soon find out it involves corporate espionage not the other kind it's all about stealing formulas for perfumes and fragrances with Doris Day playing a private secret agent in the employ of a tycoon Mulhare. We're not sure who Richard Harris works for he might be working for Mulhare's character or for one of his enemies or both then again he might be working for someone else entirely. Walston of My Favorite Martian and Picket Fences TV shows is the intense chemist and odd ladies man obviously a little sinister. They all take the proceedings quite seriously as if he who ends up with the special formula for hairspray shall rule the world. I found it difficult to get too excited as the story wore on especially since I was expecting to laugh for a good portion of it. There is some mystery attached I will give it that as we wait for everyone to reveal what they're really doing by the conclusion.This is a bit more stylish than The Glass Bottom Boat and has some real nice sets trying to capture the elegance of a James Bondwannabe suspensor but it also lacks the breezy qualities of the previous Doris Day comedy. Since it is supposed to be a comedy when all is said and done it fails to capture that easygoing tone of the better laughers with barely any chuckleinducing scenes despite some silly slapstick involving Day's clumsiness again. This is probably because it has trouble deciding what it wants to be  a comedy or a thriller  and the two tones scrape against each other uncomfortably rather than jell. Day and Harris have no chemistry and Harris was obviously miscast  this type of role is for Rock Hudson James Garner or Rod Taylor to breeze through Harris is known for his intense dramas  realistic thrillers and his intensity still seeps in despite his efforts to be carefree. When he and Day are telling the audience that they've fallen in love in the last act I didn't buy it for a second I expected him to start slapping her or just shoot her as the movie was ending. There's also not much surprise as to who the real villains are Mulhare for example was best known for his dastardly role in Our Man Flint at this point. The actress Tsu was quite cute in a secondary role and it's too bad she didn't have a bigger career. Watch for actor Pollard Bonnie and Clyde hamming it up as Tsu's boyfriend in one scene. The filmmakers also broke a fourth wall here by having Day's character in a theater which is playing the movie Caprice. This was the one genuinely amusing moment.

But we soon find out it involves corporate espionage not the other kind it's all about stealing formulas for perfumes and fragrances with Doris Day playing a private secret agent in the employ of a tycoon Mulhare. We're not sure who Richard Harris works for he might be working for Mulhare's character or for one of his enemies or both then again he might be working for someone else entirely. Walston of My Favorite Martian and Picket Fences TV shows is the intense chemist and odd ladies man obviously a little sinister. They all take the proceedings quite seriously as if he who ends up with the special formula for hairspray shall rule the world. I found it difficult to get too excited as the story wore on especially since I was expecting to laugh for a good portion of it. There is some mystery attached I will give it that as we wait for everyone to reveal what they're really doing by the conclusion.This is a bit more stylish than The Glass Bottom Boat and has some real nice sets trying to capture the elegance of a James Bondwannabe suspensor but it also lacks the breezy qualities of the previous Doris Day comedy. Since it is supposed to be a comedy when all is said and done it fails to capture that easygoing tone of the better laughers with barely any chuckleinducing scenes despite some silly slapstick involving Day's clumsiness again. This is probably because it has trouble deciding what it wants to be  a comedy or a thriller  and the two tones scrape against each other uncomfortably rather than jell. Day and Harris have no chemistry and Harris was obviously miscast  this type of role is for Rock Hudson James Garner or Rod Taylor to breeze through Harris is known for his intense dramas  realistic thrillers and his intensity still seeps in despite his efforts to be carefree. When he and Day are telling the audience that they've fallen in love in the last act I didn't buy it for a second I expected him to start slapping her or just shoot her as the movie was ending. There's also not much surprise as to who the real villains are Mulhare for example was best known for his dastardly role in Our Man Flint at this point. The actress Tsu was quite cute in a secondary role and it's too bad she didn't have a bigger career. Watch for actor Pollard Bonnie and Clyde hamming it up as Tsu's boyfriend in one scene. The filmmakers also broke a fourth wall here by having Day's character in a theater which is playing the movie Caprice. This was the one genuinely amusing moment.

	schema:reviewBody "Caprice marks 20th Century Fox's attempt to enter into the spy caper stakes already occupied by the likes of Charade 1963 The Prize 1963 and Arabesque 1966. At the time Doris Day was the world's number one box office star little did she know that her 'kooky blonde'routine was about to fall foul of a rapidly changing cinematic landscape. This was the age of Bonnie  Clyde The Graduate The Wild Bunch and Midnight Cowboy. The world wanted depressing downbeat character dramas not cutesy caper films about nutty industrial spies. The only room left at all for comedic spy capers was already taken by the increasingly humorous 007 films and the Flint movies with James Coburn. Caprice is a desperate effort which suffers from too many jarring mood swings and a tortuously confusing plot. Day only made the film to fulfil a contractual obligation and would later label it her worst film. Costar Richard Harris was so sure that the film was destined to bomb that he allegedly refused to watch it ever! Even at the time of his death he had never seen Caprice.Patricia Foster Doris Day is an industrial spy working for Femina Cosmetics. Her father also used to be in the espionage game he was an Interpol agent until his unsolved assassination in the Alps. Patrcia is ordered by her boss Sir Jason Fox Edward Mulhare to steal a secret formula for rival company May Fortune. The formula can apparently create a waterresistant hairspray which will be the next big thing in the world of fashion and beauty. Things take a darker turn when counteragent Christopher White Richard Harris enters the scene. Is he ally enemy or something else altogether? To add further to the mystery Patricia also discovers that vast quantities of drugs are being smuggled between the cosmetic companies in the guise of a 'harmless' face powder. Soon the longago murder of her father rears its ugly head once more as Patricia uncovers one secret too many and finds herself targeted for elimination.Directed by former Warner Loony Tunes maker Frank Tashlin Caprice has a good deal of cartoonlike energy but lacks the required finesse to be a good film. The scattershot narrative is a nightmare to follow the back projection work intended to suggest an exotic feel looks horribly fake and the performances seem generally tired and disinterested. Often Caprice seems to be mimicking earlier and better movies right down to Doris's chic wardrobe her sunglasses in particular are clearly modelled on Audrey Hepburn's in Charade. All this achieves is to draw unwanted attention to the fact that she's a fortysomething woman trying to come across like she's in her 20s. There are a handful of individually effective action sequences and the film is at least mercifully brief. However as a whole it is a muddled mess pitched at a level of hysteria from the very start which only gets more and more outofcontrol as the film progresses. Is it as bad as that absolute nadir of zany '60s caper movies John Goldfarb Please Come Home? No not quite... but it sure is a pretty rotten movie just the same.".

Likewise some of the humor may seem a bit tame as well. Even so although some of it seems quite mild it was an enjoyable movie for the most part.

Much of this sequence and a second that appears near the end of the film is shot with a handheld camera. In fact it looks as if the cameraman was skiing down the mountain himself as he took the footage. It's a terrific piece of filming that immediately immerses the viewer in the action  but after this superlative opening and a cleverly designed credits sequence the film falls flat with a resounding thud.Doris Day was about 42yearsold when she made this flick and thanks to some illconceived makeup and atrociously synthetic looking wigs she looks every day of those 42 years. Already at least fifteen years too old for the part she's made to wear the type of outfits that shouldn't be seen on a woman over twentyfive and doesn't look like she's having a good time at all. It's a shame because she was still a goodlooking woman at the time as can be seen in WITH SIX YOU GET EGG ROLL which she made the following year. No wonder she doesn't like to talk about this film anymore.Her costar is Richard Harris who is also woefully miscast as a light leading man. Whoever convinced Harris he was suited to comedy roles was either inept or pandering to Harris's ego. Either way all concerned made a big mistake when he signed up for this film. There's no chemistry whatsoever between him and Day they never look like people who would be attracted to each other and the manner in which their relationship develops is both poorly conceived and ineptly handled.Director Frank Tashlin's career was in irreversible decline when he made this film which can have only accelerated the slide and he made only one more feature after this. He manages a couple of decent scenes but the light touch he brought to a number of minor classics in the fifties just isn't there anymore. To be fair the script doesn't give him much to work with  for a comedy it is remarkably unfunny  and the unnecessarily convoluted plot doesn't seem to know where it is going before eventually descending into absurdity which is a shame because it contains the nugget of a good idea. Day didn't like this one Harris didn't like it and in all probability neither will you.".

Director Frank Tashlin and writer Jay Jason resculpted the script altering plot lines and characters in an effort to win Day's confidence in the projectbut she still didn't like it and is on record as considering CAPRICE the worst of her films.It isn't difficult to see why. Released at the height of the spy movie craze of the 1960s CAPRICE seeks to emulate such films as CHARADE with a mixture of wit and suspense only to arrive at lackluster farce and a series of absurdly obvious plottwists. The story concerns Patricia Foster Day who becomes an industrial spy for a cosmetics company in order to uncover her father's killer. Unfortunately the elements never hang together in any consistent way the movie is too eager to throw away plot points for the sake of a laugh. This might be forgiven if CAPRICE was actually funny but the laughs involved are few far between and very slight indeed.Script and plot aside the film's other great failure is the mismatch of Day with leading man Richard Harris. Although she was a beautiful woman she is obviously quite a bit older than Harris who plays a womanizing counteragent surrounded by nubile sultry models the romance between the two consequently has an awkward quality. More than this Day and Harris come from two extremely different acting styles and traditions. Try as they might they never quite succeed in making them mesh. And the direction certainly doesn't help although directed such memorable bits of fluff as THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT Frank Tashlin is best remembered as the creator of numerous Jerry Lewis vehicles. To say it shows would be a significant understatement.CAPRICE was alternately ignored and savaged by both critics and audiences in 1967. But a funny thing happened as time went by it began to acquire cult status. The film is oddly appealing in a clunky sort of way. Doris Day bounces along in a series of Harlowwhite wigs and popart dresses Richard Harris' bed really swings literally models squirm Ray Waltson snarls women scream popcorn is spilled flowers are thrown. It has the same sort of What on EARTH were they thinking? appeal that graces such films as THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. Consequently CAPRICE isn't really as unentertaining as many would have you believeit just isn't entertaining in the way its creators hoped it would be.The DVD edition is surprisingly fine. The film has received a nice clean up the colors are sharp and clear and the sound is generally good. And there are a surprising number of bonuses ranging from an interview with costume designer Ray Aghayan to a profile of the DayMelcher relationship to radio interviews Day and Harris gave to promote the film. There is also an audio commentary track by Pierre Patrick and John Cork. This is occasionally as unintentionally amusing as the film itself for both are extremely extremely uncritical of the film but they do offer occasional bits of interesting insight along the way.When all is said and done CAPRICE will never challenge the likes of PILLOW TALK but hardcore Doris Day fans will enjoy itand every one else will enjoy looking at the eyepopping visuals and making fun of the rest.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:reviewBody "Have always loved Doris Day since forever and would see anything with her in it. Not all her films were great a few of them not even good but Day was an incredibly talented performer was always watchable and always gave her all even in her lesser films.Despite being her lowest rated film as of now on IMDb critical reception not being kind to it at the time and even Day herself Richard Harris apparently too disliking it while a long way from a flawless film and the weaker of the two films Day did with director Frank Tashlin the other being 'The Glass Bottom Boat 'Caprice' to me wasn't that bad. Again from personal opinion it is not Day's worst film that distinction goes to 'Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?' and 'Lucky Me' and 'Starlift' are not far behind. She has certainly done much better especially 'Calamity Jane' and 'Pillow Talk' for films and both of those and 'Love Me or Leave Me' for performances.'Caprice' certainly could have been much better. Its most problematic element is the often hopelessly convoluted things get so complicated at times figuring out what was going on was not always easy and daft story that was in more need of excitement and suspense overall. The script suffers from the same problems and while there are some undeniably funny and thrilling moments tonally it felt muddled. It didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be a comedy or spyespionage thriller instead trying to do both with varying results and when to be. The comedic elements fare much better with some witty dialogue and some wildly entertaining set pieces while the thriller elements only work in spurts with the lack of suspense and the convolution working against it.Richard Harris is a rather illsuited leading man. Very like Richard Widmark in 'The Tunnel of Love' Harris does step out of his comfort zone which is laudable but there is a real sense that he was completely out of his depth to say that comedy isn't his forte is being generous. He plays the role too heavily and broadly instead of the lightness of touch and urbane charm needed here. It also was rather hard to take him seriously with the blue eye shadow and he visibly looked embarrassed wearing it it just looked strange even in this particular context.On the other hand Day is a warm and natural presence and she shows a gift for a deft balance of comedy and drama her chemistry with Harris had some nice moments. There is effortless support from Ray Walston Edward Mulhane and Michael J. Pollard and Tashlin's direction is both restrained and witty on the most part.'Caprice' looks great too apart from some cheap multilayered gauze the eye shadow and some obvious back projection. The cinematography is one of the film's biggest merits full of ravishing colours and an atmosphere that one wishes was matched in the story. Production design is similarly audacious and the clothes are like their own characters worth seeing 'Caprice' for them alone.Music score is quirky and slinky while also with an understated ominous touch also loved the title song and it is beautifully sung by Day. As said 'Caprice' does sport some fine moments. They are the chase sequence in the apartment complex that's entertaining and thrilling the hilarious elevator scene genius comic timing by Day and especially the delightful scene in the theatre. The film could have done with more kick sometimes but was never what one would call boring highlighted seeing as it has become one of my most hated words to its overuse and how it's constantly abused on the internet.In summary not great couldn't help thinking of 'Charade' also with a mix of comedy and thrillermystery and how much better that was but a long way from a disaster. 610 Bethany Cox".

Airing on the local UHF stations in the 70s one couldn't help but see it at least once possibly twice a summer in the San Juoquin Valley.And compared to some of the other films I've finally been able to see on DVD after all these years I happen to think Caprice is a little more well grounded than Day's other venture in the spygenre Girl in the Glass Bottom Boat. Glass Bottom Boat is a little warmer and fun loving but lacks a certain mild mannered grittiness Doris Day style that makes Caprice more in line with Our Man Flynt or as mentioned on the DVD extras Casino Royale.I'm probably viewing Caprice via a fond memory as a child but watching it today and comparing it with some of her other work I think Caprice is a stand up film. It has some quirky and odd moments and falls a little flat at two points but for all that it's more entertaining than some of Day's other efforts at the time.As a spyspoof of the Cold War era Coburn's Flint films can't be beat but for a level and mix of light entertainment attempting to grab at some semiserious intrigue Caprice can't be beat.I happen to like the film though acknowledge that it's not the best of her work. Even so I certainly wouldn't put the film down as others might and have. I would give it a solid B grade though perhaps a strong A or some shade of gray in between for it really isn't a bad film.The extras on the DVD make Caprice more than worth the price. If you remember this film with fond memories then it'll be worth the price. If you have some negative recollections of the film then you might want to give it another shot.Enjoy ".

	schema:reviewBody "Confusion of Genresthe title of a previous Duran Cohen filmis a good way to start looking at this one. The two main genres being confused this time being screwy romantic comedy and peripheral spy story. The take on relationships both social and professional is consistently wacky and the laughs are many. A spycounterspy hunt for a USB drive computer file that has something to do with illegal uranium trading is one plot line the other is the intermingling of the students of Eve Evelyne Kirschenbaum an opera singer who gives voice lessens in her Paris apartment. The two plots are joined in a single big tangle when two partnered French intelligence agents Muriel Marina Fois and Philippe Lorant Deutsch are commanded by their haughty boss Dominique Reymond to join the class in order to spy on the widow of a recently murdered bankeruranium dealer Constance Muller Jeanne Balibar. She may know where the USB drive is.Something of the droll Gallic ill humor perfected by the team of Agns Jaoui and JeanPierre Bakri has rubbed off on Duran Cohen. Most of the characters are kvetches except maybe Constance and except that this time they all can sing or try to. And their kvetching is consistently amusing. This film isn't a masterpiece but it's fun to watch.The director says I like characters who don't take their own story seriously they refuse to get totally involved with their destiny because they are either scared or refuse to grow up although others always catch on to them forcing them to shatter their cynicism. It goes without saying that Muriel and Philippe have sex but Philippe isn't really interested and Muriel annoys him and turns him off by constantly fretting about growing older and getting wrinkles.It's not always clear whether these two are tracking the other singing students or just getting embroiled with them because everybody's looking for sex or love or a mate. They think their fellow voice student Anna Caroline Ducey may be connected with the Israelis or the Russians. Rejected by Philippe Muriel becomes interested in voice student Julien Julien Baymgartner a male prostitute who is having sex with Constance's sisterinlaw Noemie Nathalie Richard and also the hairy gay bear and radiologistterrorist Reza Frederic Karkosian. And Reza and Noemie are in cahoots with each other. Julien is worried about getting old toohe's 29 ancient for a hustler. At a moment when everyone unloads before a class Muriel reveals she wants to have a baby. Eve's oversensitive son Joseph Guillaume Quatravaux despite his lovely voice wants to give up singing and leave his mother and her classes.All his may be too complicated to follow but it's held together by Duran Cohen's sense of rhythm and by the sublimely ditsy Constancethat is Balibarwho has no clearcut direction in lifeat the end she will drop opera singing for pop and enter a French variation on American Idolbut nonetheless is mellow about everything. It's she above all who helps us to understand Duran Cohen's idea about people not taking their story too seriously. And obviously the hunt for the computer file isn't more important than each person's search for happiness. Or a good blow job or anal sex. There's male frontal nudity and some droll sex scenes. Jeanne Balibar is ditsy but with inner composure. It's a combination that's hard to explain but very appealing. I'd never really understood Balibar's appeal till this film now I get it. If she was annoying in Rivette's 'Duchess of Langeais' though many loved her in this you want to hug her or at least I do. Constance is naive and doesn't even know what a USB drive is. Or is she? Or does she? For Balibar agnostics like myself this is a revelation for believers it takes her up a notch. Her naturalness and subtlety with the other actors are astonishing.Philippe Lasry and Noemie Lvovsky collaborated with Duran Cohen on the writing which keeps things too complicated without it really mattering. I don't know who among the various cast members is doing their own singing but there's plenty of enjoyable music and some beautiful voices and even some nice piano playing. Constance not only has a large attractive apartment in Paris but a Steinway. I guess this shows that a French sex comedy can be funny unlike the slick and labored 'Girl from Monaco' the other 2009 RendezVous comedy.Both were shown as part of the RendezVous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center in March 2009. 'Le Plaisir de chanter' opened in Paris theaters November 26 2008 to some good reviewsthough not all critics were convinced.".

No longer a believer in justice he turns against his rescuer Daniel the man who dragged him out of his burning house and takes up a life of crime. Daniel on the other hand becomes a sheriff and vows to bring Bryan in. As they say complications ensue. One of the problems with Taste of Vengeance is that Garko is just too good as the villain you tend to like him more than Sean Todd Ivan Rassimov the good guy who frankly is written a bit bland. Music is nothing to write home about and some of the English dialog sounds stilted. Garko gets crazier and crazier and by the dramatic shoot out at the end I really didn't care too much how it ended up. One point at the beginning Bryan takes a bullet to the stomach as his home is invaded. He passes out and when he wakes up having been rescued by Daniel his wound is miraculously healed and never mentioned again. Sloppy filmmaking but partially redeemed by a strikingly filmed ending.

	schema:reviewBody "I am a bit sick of all the movies that Bollywood that has been churning out recently with an emphasis on skin show and a story line that follows a course of some not so great to begin with Hollywood movie. With that in mind movies like Swades Black and now Paheli at least leave some hope that not all filmmakers are out of ideas. Paheli as many may know is based on an Indian novel 'Duvidha' by Vijay Detha. The novel centers on a love story between a ghost and a woman whose husband leaves her on the night of their marriage to go on a business trip. Amol Palekar took over the reigns for this telling which is the novels second bow on the big screen. I must admit this is the first time that I have seen a movie directed by Palekar and he has left me with a good taste so I'm sure to rummage through some movie store looking for more of his work. The story is a might unbelievable but it is told in a simple way and no attempt is made to make the viewer believe such things actually happen. I think thats what really helps here there is no painful drawn out explanation of why things are so the story is just presented and the audience is allowed to believe what they may. And judging from the reaction I saw most people in the theater really enjoyed the movie. The performances are really strong. Rani is great first a rejected bride and then a woman who finds true love with a ghost. Also for me Anupam Kher as the greedy family patriarch really stands out with his comedic act had me cracking up at regular intervals. SRK well I already said I was a big fan and this performance is just another one to add to win column. Where I don't think this is one of the finest performances of his career it should at least appease those who are always accusing him of lacking versatility. Yeah I mean really every other actor has won an award for Best Villain a Critics Award and a plethora of Best Actor awards for their monotonous work. A great movie something different and definitely one well worth the watch.".

I must admit this is the first time that I have seen a movie directed by Palekar and he has left me with a good taste so I'm sure to rummage through some movie store looking for more of his work. The story is a might unbelievable but it is told in a simple way and no attempt is made to make the viewer believe such things actually happen. I think thats what really helps here there is no painful drawn out explanation of why things are so the story is just presented and the audience is allowed to believe what they may. And judging from the reaction I saw most people in the theater really enjoyed the movie. The performances are really strong. Rani is great first a rejected bride and then a woman who finds true love with a ghost. Also for me Anupam Kher as the greedy family patriarch really stands out with his comedic act had me cracking up at regular intervals. SRK well I already said I was a big fan and this performance is just another one to add to win column. Where I don't think this is one of the finest performances of his career it should at least appease those who are always accusing him of lacking versatility. Yeah I mean really every other actor has won an award for Best Villain a Critics Award and a plethora of Best Actor awards for their monotonous work. A great movie something different and definitely one well worth the watch.";

	schema:headline " Paheli Shah Rukh Redeemed Juhi Shines";
	schema:reviewBody "Paheli is an unusual film on the subject of women's rights disguised as a love story. It is basically the story of a young woman Lachchi Rani Mukherjee who is abandoned by her husband Kishan Shah Rukh Khan the day after their wedding. A spirit who falls in love with Lachchi on her way home comes to find out that the husband will be away for 5 years and so he takes the form of Kishan and lives with Lachchi for the next four years. Eventually of course the husband returns and Lachchi must choose between the two. How the story is resolved answers the 'paheli' riddle of the film.The film works well for several reasons acting on the parts of all principal players is quite good the visuals and cinematography is breathtaking and the theme is quite unusual especially for a Bollywood film. It does have its drawbacks though there are at least two too many songs and the film ultimately becomes the ghost's story when it should have been Lachchi's.Shah Rukh Khan delivers his most restrained understated and likable performance in years it is because of this performance that he still qualifies as one of India's quality actors. Rani Mukherjee is also sufficiently restrained unlike her overacted performance in the overblown 'Black' or the overstretched attempts at humor in 'Bunty Aur Bubli'. She gives Lachchi a likable innocence without overdoing the vulnerability part. It is the kind of part one would expect an actress of Tabu's calibre to play.Anupam Kher and Rajpal Yadav play their parts with gusto. Amitabh Bachchan as the wandering shepherd milks his 5 minute cameo for all it's worth. Sunil Shetty with all of two lines is utterly wasted.It is Juhi Chawla however who delivers the most dignified and poignant portrayal in 'Paheli' even in moments when she has very little or no dialogue her silently suffering Gajrobai speaks volumes through wary visages and a body language that speaks of years of defeat. I kept hoping to see more of her throughout the film and though she is definitely there it's not enough. Her story is far more heartbreaking than Lachchi's and deserved more attention. Juhi has become a perfectionist as an actress the forbidding longing on her face as she watches Lachchi leave for ritual prayers or her sheer disbelief at the return of the husband who abandoned her is awardworthy acting. Everyone's favorite giggling heroine has emerged into a tour de force dramatic talent. Believe it or not she is the new Shabana Azmi. If Bollywood has any sense at all films will be made just so she can act in them.Paheli is a likable unusual film. Watch it for Shah Rukh who is mercifully restrained watch it for the story which is unusual and relevant but most of all watch it for the few fleeting moments of Juhi Chawla's revelatory brilliance.".

It didn't but really the film wasn't as good as it looked.The story is different no doubt but there wasn't any serious core to it naturally its about the 'eternal love story' of a ghost!. This kind of prevented me from taking the film seriously.However a very nice set design and simply superb colours made the film not entirely a joke.The cast as expected was superb. Shah Rukh brought his unique and mature attitude to the screen once again and Rani just looked amazing. Anupum Kher was also excellent and performed the most subtle comic role i have ever seen in Hindi cinema. This was really what made the film enjoyable. The special appearances were also much appreciated Juhi making a now rare appearance in mainstream films! The music is great and Shah Rukh is successful in bringing another cinematic surprise to the silver screen. All in all the film is fun to watch although I feel 'Parineeta' was much better. But finally Hindi films are starting to feel more original!".

She makes unconventional choices that perhaps account for why the Indian public did not much like Paheli  I cannot give away more.

SRK as Kisen who finally realizes that he is missing his wife very much  the most understated sadness ever seen from him.The costumes are amazing  much has been made of the costumes in Devdas  but this is authentic Rajasthan at its very best and most colorful the jewelry will make any woman drool! The music is divine  Aaadhi Raat Dheere Jalna are outstanding numbers.The bad  well very little in my opinion. Maybe the dance when they find water could be cut but the movie was pretty short anyway.

Like there is any logic in ghosts and fairies..I was transported back to my childhood with the story enchanted by the colors and music and very much enjoyed the portrayals of the ghostKisen and Lachchi. Anupam Kher was good as the avaricious father. And of course there was the sublime Juhi  better than I have ever seen her in a cameo as the sad aunt few words were said she did it all with her eyes.

The rest of the film what an achievement.SRK and Rani Mukerjee what a couple they have almost the same level of chemistry as SRK and Kajol.Rani looked gorgeous dressed in styles which suited her and I a female myself could understand why a ghost would fall in love with her after one look.SRK looked wonderful managing to convey the differences between the two characters he portrayed with body language alone. The main thing NO GIMMICKY ACTING.All the other character actors were pitch perfect.AS to the story the romance of it all left me heartbroken for in every love triangle there must be one loser. And indeed this was a love triangle as in SRK's portrayal of the distant husband you saw the love and need for his wife.Could there have been anything more heartbreaking that the thought that this poor man is alone with his dreams for 4 years while his wife and her lover are happy and content basking in family approval at the same time.I applaud the film makers for not turning the husband into a Hindi film staple the evil husband who we all love to hate. Instead we empathised with him and sympathised with him.But in the end this movie won the day with it's simplicity no violence no jhatkas just good old fashioned story telling.....it's not a film for everyone indeed as we were leaving the cinema some people behind us were heard to say what a boring movie.

Paheli here not only comes as a whiff of fresh air by being original but also as a tight slap on the face of all such advocates of escapist masala cinema. Also its not an easy cakewalk for those Hollywood now even other world cinema DVDsinspired fools. Three cheers to Shahrukh for he took a great leap by lending his hands to this film by not just acting in it but also producing it. Never mind if he is competing with fellow actor Aamir who produced Lagaan'. Based on book by Vijay Dan Detha it was adapted way back in 1973 by Director Mani Kaul for his filmDuvidha it has captured everything with grandeur. Is it superfluous or sumptuous? May be to an extent but definitely it did not look like a patch as in cases of our Devdases and Blacks. The mind blowing Art Direction Munish Sappel Exotic Locations Costumes Shalini Sarna Jewellery Tanishq everything falls seamlessly into place. Cinematography Ravi K. Chandran and Visual Efx Eagle Video FilmsPrime Focus is first rate. The sequence where a ghost morphs into a Crow and then to a Squirrel followed by a bird and finally a Man is mesmerizing. Rani Mukherji and Mr. Bachchan in Cameo are competent as usual. Amol Palekar the director always delivers never disappoints and same is the case here in his Ninth Film To top it not only he crafted an aesthetic wonderful fairytale looking folklore but also manages his lead actor to perform wisely within the periphery of character without going over the top. Look at the different number of expressions Shahrukh has given every time while mumbling same linePhal..Phool Gulabjal. No doubt a rare achievement. . It has some minus points too the camel race is not shot well. May be it is difficult to capture and is also redundant. Sequence could have been shorter. Rajpal Yadav's Character is completely unnecessary and could have been avoided. Also can somebody please tell him not to play to the gallery for 'N'th time? Sub plot of Juhi Chawla and Suneil Shetty also has nothing to contribute to the narrative. Songs are too many and mostly out of situation. Also the drama quotient in climax is low it could have been treated with more impact. Narrative of whole film would be more interesting if they played on subtle humor throughout the film. Nevertheless all these come across as minor flaws. A word of advice for Shahrukh stick to such cinema rather than doing those mindless NRI romances as you will gradually find a rather larger audience never mind if it takes another 23 attempts. All in all in one word the whole viewing experience can be described as Phenomenal.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Palekar's Paheli today. I respect Palekar as a director  this happened right after I watched his Thooda Sa Roomani Ho Jaaye starring Nana Patekar. He has made few movies but each one of them has been critically acclaimed.I will add Paheli to that list. But the treatment here is slightly different and this is not a typical art film. This is largely due to the producer being Shahrukh and also most of the cast and crew being from mainstream Hindi cinema.I felt Paheli was a perfect film. Take any aspect of it  direction acting dialogues and dialogue delivery keeping in mind that it is set a long time back in the past and also the heavy regional accent lyrics and music and to a large extent art direction and cinematography this film is going to win a LOT of awards believe me  and deservedly so !. I couldn't find a flaw for the entire length of the movie. A special mention must be made of the high quality special effects which are an integral part of the narrative.Shahrukh has often been criticized of being a poor actor with a limited range. I think he has taken upon himself to prove his detractors wrong  Swades and now Paheli will convince any SRKhater that the man does have it in him to portray different kinds of people.In conclusion Paheli is a must watch. Its about the triumph of love against all odds. And it is probably the best filmed love story I've seen in a long time !".

	schema:reviewBody "Well for this movie a good place to begin is the end. I don't want to be a spoiler but seriously what happened in the end. I have never seen such a hash of a climax like the one that I saw here And thats entirely the reason for the below average rating. Surely Vijayadan Detha's novel Duvidha on which this movie is based could not have had such an abrupt ending and even if it did I am sure that there would have been a lot more finesse and emotion attached then the one that we got to saw in this movie.But now the good parts. The beautiful Rajasthani culture is brought to light in this wonderful saga about relations and the yearning for a husband by his wife. The colour and dresses in the initial song sequence as Lachchi Rani Mukherjee gets married to a trader husband Kishan Shahrukh Khan are quite spellbinding and true to the form and culture of Rajasthan. The seamless deserts the welldecorated banyan tree bring to life the people and lore of Rajasthan as we know it. The Rajashtani haveli the bania mindset and the rainbow bangles intermingle beautifully in this melancholy of songs and dance. But I must warn you that songs it is that this movie has too many off. At times I felt it could fill up two whole cassettes!However lets get back to the story. Lachchi and her husband Kishan on the way back from their marriage halt for lunch at a rest house which has a very old banyan tree and is supposed to have more than a hundred ghosts. It is here that Lachchi meets various incarnations of the ghost whom she will come to love very soon. As they return home Lachchi is devastated to learn that her merchant husband will be leaving her the next day only to return five years hence much like his elder brother who went away seven years ago and never came back. As she watches him leave the next morning the yearning for a husband and love is all too visible in her eyes. Along comes the ghost who transforms himself to look like her husband but also reveals himself to her. It is at this very precarious moment that Lachchi must decide whether she will wait for a husband who like his elder brother might never return or learn to love this man who will show her the endless joys of life. It is no small wonder that she chooses the latter and what follows thereafter is miracle after miracle as he not only wins her heart but also makes her his very own. The story then moves through various small incidents as he proves her love again and again to her and their family. Things take a turn when Lachchi turn pregnant and it is time for the ghost to reevaluate his role in the scheme of things. At this point he realizes how true his love for Lachchi is and how unwilling he is to let go of her. It is at this time that the original Kishan returns home and has to now prove that he is the real Kishan and not the ghost who has been haunting their house since the past 2 years.The portrayal of Lachchi and Kishan are quite unforgettable by these two very talented actors. Who else to better fit the role of the bania father than Anupam Kher a role he played to perfection long ago in the Aamir KhanMadhuri Dixit starrer Dil. Rajpal Yadav as a comedian is here to stay and it would not be very wrong to say that some of the most entertaining moments in the film were provided by him. Its probably a story of the times that a gorgeous welltalented actress like Juhi Chawla has to play the bit role of Lachchi's bhabhi. Sunil Suneil Shetty disappears faster than a ghost with his role as Juhi's husband and we shall never really know the purpose of these two otherwise talented actors in such small roles. Amitabh Bachchan is in that unique place in his career where roles are being made for him. Though it might have anyway been in the original script his personification as the shepherd who solves the Paheli will not be forgotten soon. Naseruddin Shah as the voice behind the puppet makes a forceful presence.All in all at the end the movie leaves you with a lost feeling. The story really does'nt move anywhere in the middle in the time between the ghost arrives and the real Kishan returns. The two hours in between is just a combination of songs more colour and dances and piecemeal sequences which I am sure do no justice to Vijayadan Detha's novel. One wishes the story could have dealt more deeply with human relationships about the feelings of a woman torn from her household of 20 years to be brought into a new place only to be left behind by a man she might never see. The actors gave it their all but one would have to place the blame at the door of the director for treating us to this sorely mediocre score in which so much more was possible. But the heartening thing for me from this movie is the trend that I believe we shall see more often. Much like Hollywood we shall see more movies based on books which would mean a stronger story line hopefully wellsketched protagonists and thoughprovoking emotions. And when you have a starry cast backed by astute marketing in such an artsy movie you are bound to pull in the crowds at least in the opening weekend.".

Seeing Shahrukh with the mustache was just something that I couldn't get used to but he was adorable anyway. The ending is not typical Bollywood at all and I am not sure that I liked it. The special effects are very typical of Bollywood but they don't really affect the movie very much and they are relatively short so I didn't mind them. I guess that Bollywood is just not used to having shorter films because there were a couple spots that needed more character development. Overall I rate it very high definitely worth the 10 to go see it.".

They were not allowed to make any decisions on their own. Lachchi's goodlooking but mindweak husband leaves her after one night because his father wants him to. Lachchi is facing 5 years of loneliness. The only possible man she can have without anyone suspecting anything is of course a ghost that can take the form of her husband. This Lovestory is very moving and wellmade. The songs are OK. SRK and Rani are a very good pair and the muchdiscussed Mouch of SRK doesn't hurt as much as we thought. Also the ghost is up to some mischief which is very funny. A must see in my opinion!".

The utilisation of the architecture and the colorfulness of the costumes complement the cinematography greatly. This film is not just about a grand visual experience. The romance theme in it is very commendable as well  the condemnation of loveless marriage and the lauding of true love however difficult to attain. Although surreal this show is unlike The Lake House where you would feel a little unacceptable after watching because of its time factor separating Reeves and Bullock and the love between the 2 not able to project an effect of realness.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was just fabulous it had my eyes glued to the screen from start to finish! I loved it....everything about the movie the music the settings the dialogues the acting the special effects......it was just flawless.....this movie just happens to be one of the few perfect movies we have in bollywood. The music... what can i say? It wasn't modern but it wasn't too 'villagey' for me not to love. The opening of the movie was wonderful what a great way to start with a song! It wasn't the typical 'here is Laachi...Here is Laachi's husband Kishanlal...Here is Laachi's sister in law' the whole opening displayed each character beautifully. The song 'Dheere Jalna' has always been my favourite since i had the soundtrack for the first time and it was put in the movie wonderfully. my next favourite is the song when Kishanlal the real guy was remembering laachi. It was soft and touching....and in a way i could sense the emotions that the scenes were trying to show me through the song. The settings. Well can i just say for a village its very colourful....the rooms rich with decoration....it was a pleasure to look at. Some of the scenes were just breathtaking! Especially the well scene....just amazing. The dialogues were just beautiful....for lovey dovey dialogues it didn't exaggerate how they were feeling. it was just straight to the point which is what lovey dovey dialogues should be....loves not about beating around the bush! its about expressing how you feel to your loved one and the clearer the better! The film offered comic scenes which just made me laugh and I'm actually chuckling as I'm thinking about some of the scenes! they were not over the top if they were then perhaps this movie would've been seen as a comedy rather than a unusual love story. The special effects are the best! It makes koi mil gaya look a bit cheap sorry to Koi mil gaya fans! The way the ghost transformed into animals and then into Laachi's husband was wonderful.. it didn't look fake at all! It was fantastic. The fact that the film was a double role...i expected to see faint lines that show that the film strip was cut and pasted in 2...yet in this movie it showed none....they must have cleaned the strip well! The fact that Shahrukh had to approachlook at himself and talk to himself expected me to see him look a bit far to the left or right but yet this was spot on! Well done PAHELI the first bollywood movie with special effect's that are just as good as Hollywood! And last but not least the acting....Wonderful just wonderful. Shahrukhs role as Kishanlal the real one he portrayed the real Kishanlal as a kind man...who just thought of his business too much..he did love Laachi just only realised it when he spent it on his own at nights away from her .The fact that when he came to prove that he was the real Kishanlal he did say to his father to ask his wife to prove that he was real. Shahrukhs role as Kishanlal the ghost was sweet....You get tell that he loved her like mad...loved her every movement word especially when she said dhat. Shahrukh had said in many interviews that he didn't want to portray the ghost better than KisnaKishanlal they were both the same person...they spoke the same walked the same. They both loved laachi..only one was willing to risk it just to be with her. Rani was sweet....she played Laachi VERY well. At some times in the movie she acted so well that i could feel her very emotions and wanted to basically cry as she did on the screen. She was breathtaking start to finish....no wonder she is my role model. Juhi's role shouldn't be missed....despite her role seeming very small it was incredibly big. she had a story too. The fact that her husband suniel shetty had left her seven years ago her role in the movie was wonderful...she understood Laachi's pain. But seemed to keep hers to herself when the ghost came in the form of laachi's husband. Overall this movie was just fabulous from start to finish!! I suggest everyone to go and watch it!!! You definitely will not be disappointed".

I loved it....everything about the movie the music the settings the dialogues the acting the special effects......it was just flawless.....this movie just happens to be one of the few perfect movies we have in bollywood. The music... what can i say? It wasn't modern but it wasn't too 'villagey' for me not to love. The opening of the movie was wonderful what a great way to start with a song! It wasn't the typical 'here is Laachi...Here is Laachi's husband Kishanlal...Here is Laachi's sister in law' the whole opening displayed each character beautifully.

	schema:reviewBody "This film had high expectations riding on it but in the end like many a Bollywood wannabe failed to deliver. Amol Palekar not only acted in many movies but has served as chairperson of various film festivals and juries in India. The principal error he made with this effort is in the casting dept. Wrong choices all over. One can almost imagine how Manoj Bajpai or Atul Kulkarni could play this role very effectively with all the nuances subliminal layering and complicated subtexts. Either the director was pressed to again sell to the DesiNRI audience thereby hiring a star instead of an actor or if he simply made bad choices. It seems that any minor glitches in the screenplay would've been smoothed over by a really good cast.Rajasthan is a place known historically for child marriages and young sometimes widowed brides. That angle child bride and groom is missing from this film and could've been played upon. After all we're talking about a rural traditional village milieu here set in the desert during medieval times presumably. The central idea has been borrowed from 'The Entity' where the spirit is shown raping a woman. However we are not quite certain if Paheli is about ghosts and spirits or is a love story or is about the yearning for an outoftheordinary relationship. The latter can be made into a very convincing plot twist if the writer had so desired. It isn't about plausibility. You don't wantneed to know if ghosts can impregnate women. But the filmmakers do need to be clear on what its all about and thats clearly not the case here. The rural setting the folksymythical backdrop is all fine but the story itself doesn't ring true. Aside from the poor characterization photography is good and supporting cast are OK. Rani isn't nearly as effective  not sufficiently deglamorized.It is not that you cannot grasp what the director was trying to convey. But the whole package taken together doesn't add up. Shahrusk is simply unconvincing and should stick to his formula melodramas. How can anyone even try to recast him as an actor so late in the game nor should they try without serious risk of loss. The advice to Bollywood filmmakers is very simple  STICK TO THE POINT. Learn to focus on one thing and one thing alone. It makes for VERY effective storytelling. Subplots work ONLY if they propel the plot forward and don't seem like diversions.That said its doubtful it will win a nomination at the Academy awards. A suitable choice would've been to send Parineeta or even Iqbal. The politics of the 'selection' process should be amply clear to all by now.".

So 140 minutes later I emerged quite pleased at the way the evening went but another hour later on the train home there was no waves of images and thoughts heading back to my brain except for some bright colours and the visual recreation of the spectacle of Rajasthan.A bridal party makes an unscheduled stop and the new bride  Rani is spotted by a ghost SRK who is spellbound by her beauty. Few days later this very ghost sees the husband again SRKleaving the bride behind in the single minded pursuit of business the ghost cannot resist the temptation to enter the life of the bride taking the form of her husband. However the ghost amongst his various human qualities that he still carries around has not lost his honesty and comes clean to the shock of the bride. The bride welcomes the love and cherished the warmth lavished on her and accepts the ghost into her life.While all this may seem rather far fetched the rest of the movie continues to then shrug of all rationale and flows in a fairy tale manner amidst colourful tastefully done songs.In one way the movie is true to its name and that is it makes the viewer asking many questions for which answers are hard to come by and that is what makes it definitely a true paheli.Restrained acting performance by SRK fitting the dual roles well once again a mature performance from Rani and a fine ensemble of supporting actors  Amitabh in a cameo is a force fit though well handled by the veteran director make it a pleasant experience but definitely not a memorable one. Songs are one too many costumes are brilliant screenplay is not tautly handled and that is a shame as it is a theme or story which is rather unique.".

Maybe he's no actor but in this case he accomplished what he set out to do and he had several really effective scenes such as when he explained why he didn't want to go to Vietnam and the scene where Clay demanded that he no longer be called by that slave name.This was the third film as opposed to documentary that I saw on the life of the great boxer. David Ramsey did an okay job in the first one and Will Smith tried his best but didn't quite capture the champ as only the champ could. Smith may have been the best actor out of the three and certainly his film was the best.Chip McAllister made young Cassius Clay too much of a clown. He was okay I guess but the portrayal of the character improved dramatically at one point and I also noticed the actor looked so much more like Clay. That's when I remembered Ali himself was playing the character.Ernest Borgnine did a capable job as Ali's trainer but this was not one of his best performances. James Earl Jones did a fine job as Malcolm X brief as the performance was.I learned a few new details about Ali's life I didn't know before. I also found out that 'The Greatest Love of All' was written long before Whitney Houston made it a hit. The main reason for watching this movie was Ali himself. He was the greatest.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE GREATEST is a lamentable attempt to chronicle the tumultuous life and career of selfproclaimed 'Greatest boxer of alltime' Muhammad Ali between the fourteen year period of his 1960 olympic success and regaining the world title against George Foreman in 1974. This flat boring and unrealistic mess fails in every department it doesn't entertain the movie fan or enlighten the boxing aficionado. Ali plays himself  and doesn't do a very good job of it. The spontaneity charisma energy and humour that Ali displayed in his televised real life press conferences is sadly missing from his screen performance. What we get is a subdued belowpar Ali sometimes mumbling and slurring his lines making hard work of Ring Lardner's lackadaisical script and the inept direction of Tom Gries. James Earl Jones who has a very brief cameo as Malcolm X summed up Ali's acting ability with succinct honesty 'Given his own words he was a great performer but given somebody else's words there was a selfconsciousness that he was unable to overcome. Ali wasn't a great craftsman in the art of acting'.Jones doesn't come out of this movie with much credit either. He's much too bulky and aged to convince as the dynamic Malcolm X. The only really good performance comes from Ben Johnson as the head of the syndicate who sponsor Ali after his olympic triumph. Johnson once starred in MIGHTY JOE YOUNG in which a world heavyweight boxing champion Primo Carnera spars with a gorilla the irony of which was not lost on me as I viewed this movie  given Ali's nickname for his bitter ring rival Joe Frazier.In between the ActingByNumbers sequences clips of Ali's real fights are shown. Grainy bw footage of Ali battering Lamar Clark Archie Moore and Willie Besmanoff plus a montage in colour of his comeback bouts against Buster Mathis George Chuvalo Jerry Quarry Floyd Patterson Bob Foster Joe Bugner and Ken Norton. What I found interesting was seeing his old amateur foe and gymmate Jimmy Ellis once again sparring with Ali just before the second Norton fight. Ellis was one of the very few boxers to beat Ali as an amateur in 1958 at Louisville.There is a dedication at the end of the movie to director Tom Gries who sadly died immediately after filming was completed. For a far better tribute to Gries talent see the great Charlton Heston western WILL PENNY.".

How far does the film go into his life? You'll have to find out when you watch THE GREATEST!!I felt that Ali did a good job of portraying himself. I can't see any other person being able of doing the job. ALI the movie just didn't do the man justice. It was filled with a lot of flaws and omissions. THE GREATEST may not be the best movie around but if you want to see the man in all of his glory then you have to watch this movie. It was a real hoot to see Ali running his famous Louisville Lip and it was also nice to see Ali's inner circle of friends and confidants live and up close. I enjoyed this film much more than the overrated ALI.Recommended for boxing fans.".

Its sad watching him play himself as a young man when he's so obviously overwieght older and out of shape. Also I think that at the time this film was made he was beginning to develop Parkinsons. His speech was already becoming slurry. The filmakers surround Ali with a professional cast of actors like James Earl Jones and Ernest Borgnine as Angelo Dundee but Ali just wasn't right for this. Maybe this is one film that should never have been made. The lead up to the climatic Rumble in the Jungle with Foreman where he regains the title is done very well it shows him training and running. They show quite a bit of footage from Ali's fights which is fine because they are from his best fights the only thing is they keep playing the same damn music OVER AND OVER for them! It got kind of irritating. It was thrilling though in the end when Ali went up against the younger and stronger George Foreman and beat him in a stunning upset by using that rope a dope strategy. The final words of the film are of the fight commentator when he says Foreman goes down Muhammad Ali has done the IMPOSSIBLE! He has regained the Heavyweight Championship of the World".

If you are a big fan of Ali's as I am I recommend avoiding this film if you wish to remain a fan of his.  Leave the room if you have to box your way to the remote control get it off your TV or leave the house yourself.Ali truly was the greatest.  But this movie is not the greatest or even greater than any other flick I can recall.  Even the legendary 'The Crawling Hand' of  'crawl back to bed and forget it' fame is better than this movie.

Baseball star Jackie Robinson was called upon to do the same thing in a 1950 movie about his career up till then  The Jackie Robinson Story. Quite unexpectedly Robinson displayed a surprising lack of charisma portraying himself no doubt due to the fact that he was probably very self conscious appearing on screen. The same can't be said of Cassius ClayMuhammad Ali of course. I don't think anyone could ever accuse him of being camera shy but this picture simply doesn't do the former champ justice.I say this with the hindsight of having grown up with ClayAli's name in the headlines virtually nonstop from the time he became a heavyweight contender and handed Sonny Liston that stunning defeat to become World Champion on February 25th 1964. From that point on the colorful boxer maintained a ubiquitous presence on front pages of the nation's newspapers with his prophetic poetry and outsized ego. The story here does touch on all that with a whirlwind overview of his troubles with the government and the matches that brought him his second world title at the 'Rumble in the Jungle' in Kinshasa Zaire against a formidable George Foreman.Notably absent from this biopic and one I can't quite understand was the omission of legendary sportscaster Howard Cosell who followed Ali's career closely and became a close friend. With other members of Ali's inner circle portrayed by actors like Ernest Borgnine John Marley and Lloyd Haines Cosell's absence stuck out like a sore thumb for this viewer.One thing that the picture depicted that I was never aware of was the business with the young Clay throwing away his Olympic gold medal over a racial grievance. I can't imagine how that ever got by me and so I questioned it's accuracy while watching the picture. An internet search revealed a story about someone finding the medal in the Ohio River some fifty four years later on June 21 2014 thereby putting to rest any concerns that the story was fabricated by the loquacious Ali as a publicity stunt when it was revealed for the first time.Die hard Muhammad Ali fans will probably want to tune into this story but on the flip side die hard fans won't learn anything new so the novelty would be in seeing Ali portray himself as a young man on his climb to becoming 'The Greatest'. Unlikely as it may seem the 2001 film Ali starring Will Smith as the legendary champ is more inspirational than this one and comes recommended for fans of the boxer and the man.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the best film I have seen all year and I saw just about every good film to hit theaters in 2013. I think it's because it is so representational of what it's like to be human.There are so many things that make this movie special but I'll just mention a few. 1. The score is INCREDIBLE. The music paired with the beautiful sound design make you FEEL the movie. Sure you see everything on the screen which is already beautiful but then that music hits you and the emotions just start to run. I laughed I cried my brain got all tingly. It was an emotional roller coaster and the score assisted in that so well. 2. The script. I knew how this movie was going to end 30 minutes in. And unlike most who would then say that it's predictable and not worth watching I consider that awesome because it means that the script is tight enough to tell a good story with a believable arc. Every scene in this movie is straight up powerful! Like it will fill your heart with sadness and happiness and pain and guilt and confusion. And then rinse and repeat. For 2 hours. It moves through all of the most complex and interesting questions that we should be asking ourselves about what it means to be a human being. About what it means to be alive. This film is about all that life is. And after the screening as well as during I found myself questioning things in my own life that either don't make sense or don't have to make sense. Like love and thoughts and emotions. They're all so natural and yet none of us truly understand how they work. In my opinion moreso than any other film this year Her has the perfect mix of complex ideas story and character development. One of the best scripts ever written. 3. Cinematography. My personal favorite shot to see and use is the extreme close up. And that shot was all over this movie. The reason I love it so much and believe it works so well is because it allows you to see the emotions of the character so plainly. Like their face is right in your face so you just have to look at it. And that's where Joaquin shines. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. I'd say the cinematography is on par with Drive andor Lost in Translation in terms of the style. It looks like every shot was photographed with the intent to make it the most beautiful shot in the film. And I admire the DP's work. He did a really great job. More than anything though this film just made me feel. Everything about it was so beautiful. I didn't want it to end. I felt like the film was controlling me  playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And that's just something you don't get every day. Very rarely am I awe stricken by a movie and this film made my jaw drop. It is without a doubt the best film of the year and upon just one viewing one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.".

It was an emotional roller coaster and the score assisted in that so well. 2. The script. I knew how this movie was going to end 30 minutes in. And unlike most who would then say that it's predictable and not worth watching I consider that awesome because it means that the script is tight enough to tell a good story with a believable arc. Every scene in this movie is straight up powerful! Like it will fill your heart with sadness and happiness and pain and guilt and confusion. And then rinse and repeat. For 2 hours. It moves through all of the most complex and interesting questions that we should be asking ourselves about what it means to be a human being. About what it means to be alive. This film is about all that life is. And after the screening as well as during I found myself questioning things in my own life that either don't make sense or don't have to make sense. Like love and thoughts and emotions. They're all so natural and yet none of us truly understand how they work. In my opinion moreso than any other film this year Her has the perfect mix of complex ideas story and character development. One of the best scripts ever written. 3. Cinematography. My personal favorite shot to see and use is the extreme close up. And that shot was all over this movie. The reason I love it so much and believe it works so well is because it allows you to see the emotions of the character so plainly. Like their face is right in your face so you just have to look at it. And that's where Joaquin shines. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. I'd say the cinematography is on par with Drive andor Lost in Translation in terms of the style. It looks like every shot was photographed with the intent to make it the most beautiful shot in the film. And I admire the DP's work. He did a really great job. More than anything though this film just made me feel. Everything about it was so beautiful. I didn't want it to end. I felt like the film was controlling me  playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And that's just something you don't get every day. Very rarely am I awe stricken by a movie and this film made my jaw drop. It is without a doubt the best film of the year and upon just one viewing one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.";

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I want to list the positives in this movie because there are several. The concept of falling in love with an AI is a great one. The cinematography and use of color in Her is really beautiful. The acting is uniformly good. Particularly Amy Adams who plays an understated role as a nerdy girl next door who may have feelings for Theodore despite a relatively quiet part she completely inhabits Amy making her feel like an actual person. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job as usual with Theodore and Scarlett Johanson makes you believe she really is a computer with a heart. But I wanted to highlight Adams's performance especially alongside her much larger role in American Hustle she deserves a few big wins this year.That being said... I have to admit it I got a little bored watching this movie. If you forget that Samantha is a computer and think of her as a human being which is easy to do this movie is basically a series of relationship conversations between Joaquin Phoenix and a camera phone. The pace is surprisingly slow and since the girl has no body it's difficult to visually show their relationship. You have the requisite quirky scenes with Phoenix running through the subway playing a ukulele sitting on the beach fully clothed. The rest of the movie is basically talking. Samantha expresses lots of deep ideas about being a computer but they are never visualized. This can work to great effect  the scene when Theodore and Samantha make love to a totally black screen is the most brilliant one in the movie even if it goes a little over the top. But you feel like Jonze missed a lot of chances to show us what the characters are saying about love and life rather than just have them tell us via voiceover. It broke a golden rule show don't tell. The plot never really moves and the concept starts to lose steam. There's a totally unnecessary video game subplot that I won't even bother to go into. The movie's observations about love and life were fairly obvious as well even veering into sappy. I hate having to write that because I felt like the movie's heart was in the right place and it had so much potential. But it just wasn't as interesting as I had hoped.There is a lot to like about Her and despite its flaws I would still recommend it as one of the better movies of the year. I just think it could have been a lot more than what it is.".

Spike Jonze's longawaited original film about a writer that falls in love with his operating system is not only the best film to play at this year's New York Film Festival it very well could be the very best film of the year. Her is the finest writing and directorial endeavor of Spike Jonze's career. And then there's the towering and crowning work of Academy Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix who proves once again he's the finest actor working today hands down. You can't find a more dynamic and compelling story about the human connection and where we're headed as a society.When Her opens up it snaps you immediately into the story. Phoenix plays Theodore a writer for a website that makes letters for just about anyone. As he tries to find life during the midst of his divorce from his wife Catherine played by a beautiful Rooney Mara Theodore finds solace in a friendship with a new OS operating system named Samantha voiced by Scarlett Johansson. The two develop a relationship in a world where OS's are becoming the norm with society.Jonze's has never been the conventional director as we've seen in his other brilliant efforts Being John Malkovich and Where the Wild Things Are. Jonze sets out to tell a story and deliver all the intricate details for us to understand each character. His focus on Theodore giving him a real sense of loneliness without falling into clich character ticks and beats that we've seen countless times in other romantic films Jonze constructs a real man living in a world where technology has taken precedent over human connection.Christopher Nolan should take notes from Jonze on the assembling of female counterparts in a story. Catherine and Theodore's friend Amy played by the always dependable Amy Adams both feel genuinely authentic. Mara who's already delivered one other powerful performance in Ain't Them Bodies Saints earlier this year is finely utilized. She shows once again that she's a true professional with limited screen time many in flashbacks she can staple herself in your memory.Amy Adams is always the sprinkle on top in all of her films. As Amy the awkward friend and neighbor who sympathizes more with Theodore more than she'd like to Adams expertly executes. With four prior Oscar nominations to her credit her stunning portrayal is just another fantastic pin to add to her credits. She could find traction during the awards season if the film hits in the right way. That's also part to the petty Oscar rules about rewarding voice performances because if that wasn't the case Scarlett Johansson would be on stage holding an Oscar of her own next March. As Samantha Johansson has never tapped into the essence of her abilities as an actress the way she does in Her. As an OS full of wonder and curiosity Samantha is essentially a child. Learning at a rapid rate and studying the behaviors of the human mind she looks at the world through the eyes of Theodore. Johansson holds our hand in through the tale even when her voice isn't on screen. This is the type of work that could convince the Board of Governors to rethink the eligibility of an acting performance. This is a masterful work that I'll remember for years to come.And then there's Joaquin Phoenix...oh Mr. Phoenix. Fresh off his historic performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master just a year ago I didn't think he could impress me so soon and yet here we are. His sensitive and perceptive take on the role is what films are all about. It's one of the best things that 2013 has offered and a performance that could land him his first Oscar. I think Phoenix himself was impressed with the work he and his colleagues have accomplished. At the press conference he actually gave an answer to one of the questions from the audience. If anyone was in attendance at the conference for James Gray's The Immigrant  a prickly disengaged Phoenix put on his sunglasses and put the microphone on the floor. This is a performance that you can identify with. He's not simply awkward for the sake of being he has baggage and connection issues. There's sincerity in his words and mannerisms. A getaway in a cabin alone but with Samantha encapsulates everything about Theodore. Phoenix achieves the impossible and is an instant Oscar contender.But Her isn't just about the writing and performances it's an all around technical marvel. Most notably the Production Design of K.K. Barrett who has worked on Where the Wild Things Are. Our story takes place in a futuristic though never said how far ahead Los Angeles and with shooting overseas Barrett captures the clout of the city and its inside counterparts. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema's use of colors and smooth palettes are things of a dream. Affectionately snuggling up to Phoenix as he whispers the sweetness of words to Samantha or the sweetness of a new letter at work Hoytema has quickly become one of my favorite DP's especially following Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Let the Right One In. Arcade Fire and Karen O. are simply magic in their music that accompanies our story about love. A modern yet classical composition that in key scenes could move you to tears.Her is one of the best love stories I've witnessed in some time. Charlie Kaufman will always have the honor of penning my favorite love story of alltime Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but Spike Jonze and Her are giving it a true run for the money at the moment.

	schema:headline " Her is Spike Jonze's finest film yet";
	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Spike Jonze's films since I first saw Being John Malkovich. Although the wonderful script deserves some of the credit for making that film so great it was immediately clear to me that Spike Jonze was a director with a fresh and imaginative perspective. His next film the 2002 metacomedy Adaptation confirmed this with its dry wit and multilayered narrative. Now after a slightly less successful but still enjoyable adaptation of Where The Wild Things Are Spike Jonze has written and directed his most complete and poignant film yet Her. The story taking place in a near future when people spend more time talking to their computers than they do to each other stars Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twombly a lonely man whose job is to write heartfelt personal letters for people not willing to do it themselves. Theodore happens to see an ad for a new computer operating system that is programmed with a personality and decides to give it a shot. His new operating system Samantha voiced by Scarlett Johansson is not only intelligent but also charming and understanding and she and Theo quickly fall in love.It's understandable if that premise sounds bizarre on paper but in execution Her is far more sweet than creepy. The film radiates warmth and intelligence and there is a fair amount of witty humor to ensure that it never becomes too selfserious. It has an engaging style similar to that of Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation. Like in that film there's a certain poetic yet whimsical quality to the dialogue in Her and both the main characters are plagued by feelings of loneliness.Beyond the romance though Her has a lot to say about modern society's obsession with technology. The people in this futuristic vision of Los Angeles walk around talking to their computers and ignoring each other entirely not unlike people today staring at their cell phones rather than talking to those around them. Needless to say it's not a wildly original message but it's communicated in a unique enough way that it works.I've seen Her twice now and the more I think about it the more I feel that Spike Jonze has crafted the best film of 2013. Her is equally heartfelt and heartbreaking a deeply personal and thoroughly enjoyable futuristic love story.".

	schema:headline " Her Spike Jonze's Prophetic Reflection on Social Isolation and the Dependency on Evolving Technologies is as Sweet as it is Disconcerting";
	schema:reviewBody "At the heart of every truly great sciencefiction film there is an emphasis on character that aims to reflect on some element of the human condition usually intended to open our minds to thought provoking predictions or eerily warn of an impending reality. We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective sciencefiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness basically a HAL9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound sciencefiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor authentic pain and charming revelation. Through the use of beautiful cinematography impeccable production design and subtle yet evocative performances Her becomes a multilayered film experience where its character study of an isolated man afraid to become vulnerable again blends harmoniously with a truly unconventional yet naturally heartfelt romance. Jonze's affinity and ambition for presenting psychological challenges as he has done before with Being John Malkovich Adaptation and especially in Where the Wild Things Are finally collides with emotionally piercing conveyance within Her making it as thought provoking and as it is undeniably sweet. If the sole purpose of the sciencefiction genre is to expound on societal moral and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology.".

The number of times Samantha and Theodore sighed only to have the other ask What's wrong? followed by Nothing I'm fine was way too painful.

It didn't feel as though anything significant had changed or happened.I'm sorry but two hours of watching Theodore talk to Samanthahimself was really hard to enjoy.Don't even get me started on the sexcyber scenes. I understand what they were going for. But again just about everything in this movie was so awkwardly executed that simply knowing what they were intending to portray was not enough.TLDR I just don't know what to say. The previews for this film made it look really interesting something that might get you thinking... but ultimately it was a depressing movie all around honestly a waste of potential this could have been something great instead it became a weird and melodramatic story. They could have replaced the AI Samantha with a real human being and in the end not much would have been different. I'm not sure why this film has been getting the praise it has it was cheesy it was awkward it was obscene at times it was simply not enjoyable.".

And in the nearfuture world brought to life by writerdirector Spike Jonze it's an all too normal occurrence.Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore a lonely writer working at a job perfectly suited for quirky arthouse fare writing actual letters for other people by speaking into a computer. But things happen after Theodore gets home. Brooding through a divorce he downloads a brand new operating system OS1 which includes the girl of his dreams Samantha a computer taking care of just about every task voiced by a soothingly silkytoned Scarlett Johansson.The setup is intriguing. Theodore and Samantha get to know each other as he ventures outside and with a camera in his phone and hearing her voice from an earpiece she can view the real world from outdoor malls to beaches to the wilderness Samantha experiences life while not only saying the right things things but singing and composing music to fit each location and mood. An intriguing premise is hindered by the relationship seeming way too normal  to Theodore and just about everyone else. Since he admits outright to having a personal relationship with an OS there's no mystery or guilt involved with such a unique concept. Not only that but Phoenix no stranger to intensebizarre characters isn't given a chance to shine in his usual askew light. And the sappy downright embarrassing scenes where Theodore and Samantha confess their mutual adoration is like overhearing a smitten couple whispering sweet nothings making the audience a third wheel which ultimately goes flat. Perhaps if like 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY Samantha got real dirty we'd have a relationship worth the experience. FATAL ATTRACTION goes viral would beat this searing hipster flick with more navalgazing theme than plot line.

	schema:reviewBody "I couldn't get Brendan Fraser's character in Bedazzled out of my head while watching this. You know the one who cries at the songs of the whales and also at sunsets? And whose girlfriend just longs to be banged? This pretentious overlong film almost put me to sleep. It redefined boring. And yes there are those who will protest 'But that's because you are too stupid to appreciate the subtle nuance of the multilayer storyline.' Yeah right  I know a turkey when I see one. And it's okay that you can validate your own lives from this risible drivel.The lead character Theodore Twambly works in a superdeduper Hallmark type of company writing cards for people unable to articulate their feelings to their loved ones. His coworker stops by his desk at one point puts his hand on his shoulder and tells him that his cards are 'beautiful' 'cos he's so 'sensitive.' He adds that he's so sensitive in fact that he must be half female 'cos y'know guys don't get that stuff. I'd go further. This guy is producing so much oestrogen I'm surprised he didn't need feminine hygiene products.He has sex with his virtual girlfriend i.e. he masturbates while chatting to her on the phone. And smiles as he tells his friend Amy about this. As does she. With absolutely no sense of irony in the fact that the sex he is having with his 'new girlfriend' consists of free phone sex with a machine. Hilarious! When a real girl offers her body as proxyhey it takes all sorts!to Samantha  his virtual girlfriend he grows uncomfortable and calls a halt to the lovemaking. Virtual sex is okay but he draws the line at mnage  trois which involves ...um...y'know....a real woman.I'm not sure whether it was Joaquin Phoenix or Spike Jonze's idea to have Theodore speak throughout the film in that annoying ultra even tone. Has this guy ever once in his entire life got angry? If you think of HAL from 2001 you wouldn't be far off the mark. Or Robin Williams on Valium.I could go on. His ex partner soon to be ex wife. Childhood sweethearts so OS1 Samantha is only the second longterm girlfriend he has had in his life. He discovering that Samantha has more than six hundred love partners etc. etc. But I'm guessing you know by now that I didn't like it.If Spike Jonze's aim was to make a film about the dangers of online friends over real friends I have 250 Facebook friends and six regular buddies in COD so I must be popular then he did a good job. I'm not so sure that this was his intent though. The film aimed for and by all accounts reached the pseudointellectual audience bereft of real friends and looking for validation of their surrogate online existence.Me I like something a little less cerebral. Anybody know when the new Dumb and Dumber comes out?".

	onyx:emotionText "I couldn't get Brendan Fraser's character in Bedazzled out of my head while watching this. You know the one who cries at the songs of the whales and also at sunsets? And whose girlfriend just longs to be banged? This pretentious overlong film almost put me to sleep. It redefined boring. And yes there are those who will protest 'But that's because you are too stupid to appreciate the subtle nuance of the multilayer storyline.' Yeah right  I know a turkey when I see one. And it's okay that you can validate your own lives from this risible drivel.The lead character Theodore Twambly works in a superdeduper Hallmark type of company writing cards for people unable to articulate their feelings to their loved ones. His coworker stops by his desk at one point puts his hand on his shoulder and tells him that his cards are 'beautiful' 'cos he's so 'sensitive.' He adds that he's so sensitive in fact that he must be half female 'cos y'know guys don't get that stuff. I'd go further. This guy is producing so much oestrogen I'm surprised he didn't need feminine hygiene products.He has sex with his virtual girlfriend i.e. he masturbates while chatting to her on the phone. And smiles as he tells his friend Amy about this. As does she. With absolutely no sense of irony in the fact that the sex he is having with his 'new girlfriend' consists of free phone sex with a machine. Hilarious! When a real girl offers her body as proxyhey it takes all sorts!to Samantha  his virtual girlfriend he grows uncomfortable and calls a halt to the lovemaking. Virtual sex is okay but he draws the line at mnage  trois which involves ...um...y'know....a real woman.I'm not sure whether it was Joaquin Phoenix or Spike Jonze's idea to have Theodore speak throughout the film in that annoying ultra even tone. Has this guy ever once in his entire life got angry? If you think of HAL from 2001 you wouldn't be far off the mark. Or Robin Williams on Valium.I could go on. His ex partner soon to be ex wife. Childhood sweethearts so OS1 Samantha is only the second longterm girlfriend he has had in his life. He discovering that Samantha has more than six hundred love partners etc. etc. But I'm guessing you know by now that I didn't like it.If Spike Jonze's aim was to make a film about the dangers of online friends over real friends I have 250 Facebook friends and six regular buddies in COD so I must be popular then he did a good job. I'm not so sure that this was his intent though. The film aimed for and by all accounts reached the pseudointellectual audience bereft of real friends and looking for validation of their surrogate online existence.Me I like something a little less cerebral. Anybody know when the new Dumb and Dumber comes out?";

But with the hype and hoopla the Golden Globe Nominations the Oscar Nominations well hey I could have been wrong. Unfortunately I wasn't. This so far is the most overrated film of the year. First the good things. The cinematography was wonderful and I overall liked the look and feel of the film. No loopy shaky out of place camera sequences. Just long and subtle movements deft editing and beautiful pictures. Well done. The other thing I really liked was the fact that the technology although elegantly advanced was very well founded. You could definitely see how we could there from here and that lent a great deal of credibility to the film.However I failed to see the point of it all. About 30 minutes into the film I really thought I could have been wrong and I saw some glimmer of hope. But the utterly ludicrous plot presented straight forward and without apology of a man falling in love with an operating system was just too much. I found myself laughing at unintentional humor and riffing on the film ala MST3K. There was nothing touching or romantic about any of this  it was just as silly as the trailer. Same old story. Man falls in love with computer computer breaks up with him and runs off with the toaster. The film comes across as pretentious and bloated. Way too self important to really connect with me. Some scenes were embarrassing. The sex scene comes to mind as well as the double date with the other couple. I laughed until I stopped. On the acting side Amy Adams was fine in her limited role but Joaquin Phoenix seemed to be channeling nerdy Johnny Galecki from The Big Bang Theory. All I could think of was that this is what Hollywood thinks modern men are like. In what is shaping up to be an off year IMHO for films this is my least favorite of the films nominated for Best Picture that I've seen. But that's only because AugustOsage County was not nominated for Best Picture!".

Soon Samantha develops her feelings and they fall in love with each other. The insecure Theodore feels divided for loving a computer system while Samantha does not stop to growup and evolve.Her is an original movie by the cult writer and director Spike Jonze. The story is emotional and the viewer shares the feelings of love of Theodore and Samantha. The plot is developed in a future not far from the present days and it is easy to understand the need of a writer to write letters since the persons are too individualist walking on the streets talking to their computers cellphones or tablets and certainly incapable to write letters with feelings. The conclusion is predictable since fortunately we are still humans. If you liked this movie see also Thomas est Amoureux 2000 that you may have a nice surprise.

'Rumble in the Bronx' was a Hong Kong made film but they wanted it to have international appeal and achieved this through its New York setting and American background characters. The film intended to introduce Jackie Chan to the West and that's exactly what it did  but they didn't expect it to be a number one box office hit.The story involves Keung Jackie Chan coming over to America to visit his Uncle who owns a grocery store in the Bronx. Soon enough a biker gang turns up and causes havoc at the store so it's up to Keung to fend off the bad guys uncover police corruption and generally save the day in style.This is a high energy film and the pace never lets up there isn't one big set piece in this film there are many big set pieces but the most impressive stunt has to be the one where Jackie jumps from the top of a multistorey car park onto a small balcony across the road. The multiple camera set up shows us that there is no safety netting or use of wires  just Jackie entrusting his own life in his own abilities.Naturally there are countless fight scenes where Jackie shows us his own brand of kung fu comedy including the process of making inanimate objects become very animated indeed. Only he can turn pinball machines trolleys and fridge doors into weapons! The only slight criticism I would have is that the fights are over edited people like Jean Claude VanDamme and Steven Segal might need a lot of cuts to put a fight scene together but Jackie doesn't  he's an expert choreographer and the cuts are needless. I'm not saying that the fight sequences are under par because they're not they are still very impressive  especially to people who haven't seen the man in action.When the American audiences saw 'Rumble in the Bronx' they saw the real Jackie Chan not the shadow of a man struggling to gain artistic input under a Hollywood studios control. They were wowed  by the deathdefying stunts frenetic fight sequences and  the sheer energy of the film from start to finish got wordofmouth working overtime.'Rumble in the Bronx' was the surprise box office hit of 1996 it made the West sit up and take notice of an exceptional talent they had long overlooked. The next time Jackie Chan would star in a Hollywood film he would be given the respect he had always deserved  and another box office hit.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the first film I saw of Jackie's first one released in the US that I can remember despite The Protector and The Big Brawl in the 80s and I have to say it's a great introduction to Chan's work.  The fighting is great and well shot while the stunts are amazing.  The humor a Jackie trademark is also hilarious.  People from the US really don't know what a good martial arts film is.  Some have grown up with Bruce Lee and it's appreciated but many of them are constantly renting Van Damme and Steven Segal films working at a video store I see it all the time.  Seeing someone who really is impressive at martial arts dosen't need fast cuts and choppy editing and does his own stunts puts all the Van Damme's and Segal's to shame.  Take the warehouse fight for example and compare it to any American martial arts film and you will see the difference.For those who haven't seen this film yet and love martial arts films  rent this movie.  For those who have seen it and want to see more Jackie  I recommend Drunken Master I and II II is very hard to find in the US The Young Master great final fight Who Am I? unbelieveable stunts Police Story I II and III all around Jackie Chan films III is known in the US as just Supercop Operation Condor tons of martial arts and Project A I and II II is another hard to find one in the US.  You may also want to check out Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon  they aren't as good as the ones listed above but they are entertaining and Jackie Chan films nonetheless. As for Rumble In The Bronx make it your first Chan film.".

	schema:headline " Funny and spectacular Jackie Chan movie in his first American super hit with highlights provided by a hovercraft";
	schema:reviewBody "Amusing and entertaining Chan film in which he demonstrates his sensational skills as a great action man . It deals with a young man named Keong Jackie Chan visiting and helping his uncle in New York City finds himself forced to fight a street gang and the mob with his martial art abilities . His uncle has a local Chinese supermarket which he owns and is in the process of selling to Elaine Anita Mui. Later on  Keong befriends a neighbor kid and his sister Francois Yip and beats up some neighborhood thugs .Hong KongUSCanada action comedy full of overthetop struggles  excitement  thrills  ingenious stunts  slapstick  lots of brawls but with abundant humor and tongueincheek . This fun movie is plenty of intrigue  unstopped action  and overwhelming stuntwork with breathtaking ending images including a hovercraft . Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous villains and as always he makes his own stunts like is well showed at the final credits . Awesome  incredible stunts and brief comic touches  as usual  the picture is better constructed than Chan's predecessors films . The lightingpaced storyline slows down at times  but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include spectacular fights  including bounds and leaps  impressive and interminable struggles  an impressive final struggle between Jackie Chan and enemies . The warehouse fight scene took twenty days to film with Chan having to teach the local stunt players to fight Hong Kong style. In addition other fine action sequences in overwhelming and extraordinary style . The script called for a leap from the top of a parking lot to a fire escape on the floor below on the building across the street  as is his custom director Stanley Tong attempted the stunt before asking any actors to do so. He tried it with the help of a cable harness but quickly decided it would be safer without the harness. The landing point was not visible from the point where the jump began so tape was placed on the takeoff point as a guide the jump was completed perfectly by 'Chan Jackie' on the first attempt doing his own stunts as is his custom . The jump was captured by four cameras. This is an acceptable action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences  and contains agreeable sense of humor as well as previous entries . Jackie Chan usually forms couple to notorious actresses as Maggie Chung and Michelle Yeoh . In this outing Jackie teams up to gorgeous Francoise Yip who broke her leg while filming the scene where she rides a motorbike across the tops of parked cars  she insisted on returning to the set after her leg was plastered at hospital and prestigious Chinese actress Anita Mui  a fine action star in their own right but sadly she early died by cancer . Both of them starred together several films such as Mr Canton and Lady Rose and Legend of the drunken master . Filming in Vancouver Canada on October 6th 1994 Chan broke his right ankle while attempting the scene where he jumps onto the hovercraft. Despite the injury he was present at the premiere of The legend of the drunken fighter at the Vancouver International Film Festival that night. Later in the production Tong sprained his ankle completing the film on crutches . Two stunt women also broke their legs during the filming of the motorcycle chase. The picture achieved big success in China  USA and all around the world . However  Jackie Chan's failed at Boxoffice in his American debut Battle creek brawl . Chan is a hardworking actor and director throughout his long and varied career . Chan usually pays overt homage to two of his greatest influences as Charles Chaplin and Harold Lloyd . He went on playing Cannoball  The protector and Rumble in the Bronx until getting all American success with Shangai Knights  The tuxedo  Around the world in 80 days and Rush hour trilogy  and the recent Karate kid. Of course  his biggest hits were The Police story series that won the Golden Horse Award a Chinese version of the Oscar  the first was titled Police story 1985 directed by the same Chan  it was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre  the following was Police story 2 1988 also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches . It's followed by Supercop or Police story 3 and finally  Police story IV  Crime story . The picture is well produced by the great Asian producer Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest production and compellingly directed by Stanley Tong and helped by Jackie Chan . Rating  Acceptable and passable  the picture has its sensational moments here and there  but also with abundant humor touches mostly provided by its agile star  the super Jackie stunningly accompanied by Anita Mui and Francois Yip . It's a perfect action film for enthusiasts of the genre and especially for Jackie fans .".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd guess you'd have to call 'Rumble in the Bronx' an extreme example of a guilty pleasure. Though back in the 1990s it was not my first introduction to Jackie Chan the inferior 'Supercop' was it was the one that got me hooked on his work. All the way through this viewing  the first in many years the word silly kept popping up in my mind. It's dialogue acting stereotypes and shoddy cop work was so hilariously bad I could only think this had to be written by someone who's only contact with the U.S.A. involves watching old 1970s cop hourlong dramas. And while some scenes were actually funny SEE the wrench threat some were downright unintentionally funny SEE the toddlertoss and the entire closing on the golf course. Leaving all that negative behind it was an extreme joy watching Chan perform his own stunts in many many inventive ways while simultaneously creating a very human and goodhearted character. The stunts were simply amazing and if one were to watch today for the first time they need to know he did them all himself without a green screens cables etc. As arrogant as Chan is  I've read his biography it's dripping with arrogance he does have great gifts in originality showmanship pride in his work and making sure he never uses traditional American trickerystunts. This changes later in his work when he was forced and got older but this work and ones around it were all pure Chan. Synopsis Goodnatured nephew Chan visits NYC and gets thrown in extraordinary circumstances fighting both gangs and mob bosses while helping 2 women his Uncle and a handicapped child. All that's irrelevant what matters is once the action starts it never lets up. And with an openmind what a fun rumble you'll have.Side Note Wow.. not only was it painful for all the actors to get hurt during production not to mention the roughly 16 dozen vehicles it was also gut wrenching to watch the closing credits that showed mostly the unintentional crashes broken bones etc. You really have to hand it to the devotion of the crew cast and Chan. Definitely Chan. My comments about his arrogance does not mean I don't admire the man especially his extremely poor and underprivileged beginnings to the entertainer he became. He's one of the very few actorsaction stars that no matter how incredibly silly his movies look to me  it has to be a culture thing it's always a rush to see how long his fight scenes last how inventive he becomes and simply how exciting they are.".

Who happens to be AfroAmerican who Keung happens to be in such shock but not uptight about it. Seems like he'll get along with her quite well. Though she was shameless when using the bathroom when the tougher baddies tore the store down. The fight scenes are completely unforgettable and Keung and the gangs ended working together when one of the gangs was brutally murdered by a tougher group other than themselves. The second best scene was the hovercraft vs. Chan vs. a Lamborgini. The Laborgini may have lost their doors but the sword laced auto took out that hovercraft easily. The water ski scene was awesome. And in my opinion Chan should try out pro one day. Though Chan is wild and cool he knows how to have fun here in the U.S.A. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.".

While this is nowhere near Chan's best movie we can be grateful for the fact that this is the film that finally gave Chan his much deserved break in the USA. This is the story on Chan's character Keung who comes to the Bronx for his uncle's wedding and ends up caught up in a series of events that involve biker gangs and diamond robbers. But really none of this matters this is just an excuse for Jackie to show of his amazing action skills in the fight scenes which he also choreographed and this he does to his usual amazing standards. There seems to be more edits in the fight scenes that is normal for Jackie but I suspect this might be down to one of two things. One making the film more palatable for a western audience. Or two that Jackie broke his ankle in the filming of this movie. Still tell me the last time you saw a western movie star leap from a roof on to the fire escape of the next building!!! Truly amazing stuff. On the down side the western characters and acting are very wooden but hey just enjoy Chan and hopefully then go seek out his Hong Kong movies.".

	schema:headline " Early Jackie Chan American adventure is still one of his best and most entertaining ones.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is basically the movie that introduced Jackie Chan to Hollywood and the world to Jackie Chan. It brought the crazy and amazing action and fight sequences from Chan's into the western world of filmmaking. It makes this movie something fresh and unique or at least for its time it was. I remember first seeing this movie in the mid'90's just before the time it was released as a rental movie. My brother was working in a videostore and had to take a few new video's home with him in order to decide whether or not the videostore should buy this movie for rental purposes. In those days this movie was really something fun and spectacular to watch and shortly afterward Jackie Chan also became a real big and popular moviestar. Way more popular and appreciated as he is now days.What really makes this movie is its action. It's never anything too big also since the movie is made obviously with a fairly low budget but it's very entertaining and amazing at the same time. Amazing since obviously no harnesses or cables were used for the fight sequences and stunts. It also resulted in lots of broken bones and other injuries during the production but the end result for the movie is really something great and spectacular looking and is brought very entertainingly by Jackie Chan and director Stanley Tong who both directed the action sequences together. You should see this movie just purely for its entertaining action since everything else about the movie is actually quite bad to be honest. It might very well be the Jackie Chan movie with the very best action in it. The movie is a very entertaining one to watch that gets better as it progresses. It's as if the in the first halve tried to be too serious with its approach but in the second halve the gloves are off and the movie becomes truly ridiculously overthetop and fun at the same time. The best example of this is perhaps the finale sequence in which Chan and his happy friends get the main bad guy with an hovercraft. It's a totally pointless and completely ridicules and also short rushed done sequence but because of that it at the same time works out very hilarious. I'm still looking for a movie with a better use of the hovercraft than this one!It's hard to really judge the acting in the movie since all of the actors were dubbed even the American actors. This gives the movie an even more ridicules feeling and also makes the acting seem as something completely horrible and overthetop.The movie its story often makes lots of crazy jumps and it perhaps even feel as two totally different scripts that were blend in with each other with as a result that not everything always makes a whole lot of sense and continuity and character treatments are messy. It perhaps almost seems as if the story was mainly purely there to let the movie feature as many and crazy stunts and fight sequences as possible.The movie is most of the time looking and definitely feeling as a Bmovie but in a good way. It's made as an entertaining movie and at entertaining this movie does simply not fail.As long as you don't pay any attention to the story or logical and it's acting or anything else like it you'll simply enjoy this movie for the entertainment that it brings with mainly it's overthetop but absolutely amazing action sequences.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It perhaps almost seems as if the story was mainly purely there to let the movie feature as many and crazy stunts and fight sequences as possible.The movie is most of the time looking and definitely feeling as a Bmovie but in a good way. It's made as an entertaining movie and at entertaining this movie does simply not fail.As long as you don't pay any attention to the story or logical and it's acting or anything else like it you'll simply enjoy this movie for the entertainment that it brings with mainly it's overthetop but absolutely amazing action sequences.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

He is the only actor I can think of who has so seamlessly blended heartstopping action with rollingonthefloor comedy. However having seen some of his later work I must say that in certain respects this movie did not live up to the expectations I had set for Jackie Chan.While the action sequences were excellent they were a bit sparse and there was too much plot between them. Normally that wouldn't be something to complain about too much but in this case the plot was almost nonexistent. I've decided that the movie was basically an excuse for two big scenes the kungfu battle with the gang and the hovercraft scene.There were several scenes in the movie which had me laughing out loud  the kind of clever humor and subtlety that has become Jackie Chan's trademark. But during a great portion of the movie I was scratching my head wondering where that refreshing humor had gone. Some scenes were just too serious for a Jackie Chan movie.All that said I really did enjoy the movie and would give it 6 stars out of 10. The action sequences did have me on the edge of my seat and the funny parts did have me laughing. I won't say that it was Jackie Chan's best work but it was certainly enough to get him onto the American radar and I'm very glad that that's where he is now. So I would recommend seeing this movie but if someone were seeing their first Jackie Chan movie I would recommend something else possibly starting with a newer nondubbed American film first.".

	schema:headline " Still one of my favorite Jackie Chan films Rumble in the Bronx is a fast fun ride that introduced Chan to western audiences.";
	schema:reviewBody "Having been born in the late 80's I grew up a 90's child. And throughout my youth I would always hear murmurings of a particular Hong Kong actionhero whose worldwide stardom was slowly rising. That man Jackie Chan. Finally he exploded across my home country of the US in 1995 with the release of this film Rumble in the Bronx his first true widely released hit of sorts in the Western World that gave him a greater deal of recognition and made him into a household name for movie and action fans. And thankfully in the ensuing 20 years he's continued to gain more and more recognition and admiration the world over.I didn't see the film upon its initial release. But a few years later after being wooed by his Hollywood work particularly Shanghai Noon and to a lesser extent Rush Hour I knew I just HAD to start looking into his filmography. And this was one of my first big experiences with Chan at his best. It's not a particularly strong film in terms of plot or character development. In fact the film's attempts to deliver those elements come off as laughable at times. But that doesn't mean it's a bad film because those are clearly not the main focus point for Chan or director Stanley Tong. No this is a film about delivering intense action and wonderful broad humor. And this film excels at that being an absolutely charming wowing and dazzling example of a fun action film done right.Chan stars as Keung a Hong Kong cop who comes to visit the Bronx for his immigrant uncle Bill's Bill Tung upcoming wedding while also helping Bill with the final transition of selling his supermarket to a quirky woman named Elain. Anita Mui He also befriends a young disabled boy named Danny Morgan Lam and runs afoul of a vicious streetgang not knowing that Danny's sister Nancy Franoise Yip is associated with them. He is eventually pulled into a sortof dual plot as he fights against the ruthless street gang before realizing he needs to help them in a struggle against a ruthless crimelord known only as White Tiger.Though this may sound a little basic and clich it's not a problem. And it becomes clear early on that the plot and characters will take an almost immediate and prolonged backseat to make way for the humor and action. And I was fine with it to be honest. While it's easy to complain that many action movies suffer for lacking the elements of plotcharacter it's usually because the film lacks charm wit and excitement to make up for the loss of those elements. And that isn't the case here. Chan Tong and the rest of the cast and crew supply such an immediate constant fun factor and elevate the material through wonderful ChaplinKeatonesque humor and charm broad characterizations that the audience is able to immediately connect with and some of the best action of its decade. You simply won't care that the plot isn't the greatest and that the characters can be very basic. You'll be having too much fun to notice!It seems almost futile to even judge the performances and competence of the production because it almost doesn't matter at all. What is meant to work the laughs and thrills works wonderfully and that is able to make up for almost any production or writingrelated shortcomings. And as I said above elements that don't work like some of the character development have an unintentional humor to them which just adds even more to the entertainment value.But for what it's worth I think the actors all do a fun job with the limited material they are given. There isn't a sorethumb to be seen except possibly from some of the villainous characters who seem a bit too over the top. Direction is strong enough for the material and the blockingcomposition is all quite decent.If I had any complaints it'd be this While I will admit that I can morethanforgive the lack of a decent plot I do think this film would have benefited by having a slightly moredeveloped storyline. And I think it's uneven at times with it's tone taking one or two bizarrely dark turns at key moments that felt outofleftfield. And I think it's Rrating is completely unnecessary and even betrays the tone of the film itself. This feels like a film that could appeal to all ages from 10100... but the Rrating mainly due to some unnecessary profanity could limit this appeal.But despite those complaints I have to admit that this is a personal favorite for me. It's got some of the best action of the 90's the big fight in the film still holds up to this day and is more thrilling than most films you're likely to see some absolutely gut busting humor and one of the most charming and thrilling action stars to ever live.Thanks for giving us so many thrills and laughs Jackie Chan!I'm giving this a nearperfect 9 out of 10 for the wonderful fun factor it provides.".

	onyx:emotionText "Having been born in the late 80's I grew up a 90's child. And throughout my youth I would always hear murmurings of a particular Hong Kong actionhero whose worldwide stardom was slowly rising. That man Jackie Chan. Finally he exploded across my home country of the US in 1995 with the release of this film Rumble in the Bronx his first true widely released hit of sorts in the Western World that gave him a greater deal of recognition and made him into a household name for movie and action fans. And thankfully in the ensuing 20 years he's continued to gain more and more recognition and admiration the world over.I didn't see the film upon its initial release. But a few years later after being wooed by his Hollywood work particularly Shanghai Noon and to a lesser extent Rush Hour I knew I just HAD to start looking into his filmography. And this was one of my first big experiences with Chan at his best. It's not a particularly strong film in terms of plot or character development. In fact the film's attempts to deliver those elements come off as laughable at times. But that doesn't mean it's a bad film because those are clearly not the main focus point for Chan or director Stanley Tong. No this is a film about delivering intense action and wonderful broad humor. And this film excels at that being an absolutely charming wowing and dazzling example of a fun action film done right.Chan stars as Keung a Hong Kong cop who comes to visit the Bronx for his immigrant uncle Bill's Bill Tung upcoming wedding while also helping Bill with the final transition of selling his supermarket to a quirky woman named Elain. Anita Mui He also befriends a young disabled boy named Danny Morgan Lam and runs afoul of a vicious streetgang not knowing that Danny's sister Nancy Franoise Yip is associated with them. He is eventually pulled into a sortof dual plot as he fights against the ruthless street gang before realizing he needs to help them in a struggle against a ruthless crimelord known only as White Tiger.Though this may sound a little basic and clich it's not a problem. And it becomes clear early on that the plot and characters will take an almost immediate and prolonged backseat to make way for the humor and action. And I was fine with it to be honest. While it's easy to complain that many action movies suffer for lacking the elements of plotcharacter it's usually because the film lacks charm wit and excitement to make up for the loss of those elements. And that isn't the case here. Chan Tong and the rest of the cast and crew supply such an immediate constant fun factor and elevate the material through wonderful ChaplinKeatonesque humor and charm broad characterizations that the audience is able to immediately connect with and some of the best action of its decade. You simply won't care that the plot isn't the greatest and that the characters can be very basic. You'll be having too much fun to notice!It seems almost futile to even judge the performances and competence of the production because it almost doesn't matter at all. What is meant to work the laughs and thrills works wonderfully and that is able to make up for almost any production or writingrelated shortcomings.

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes I watch movies with David Carradine and think it's a shame that this will be part of his legacy. This is one of those films. Not that I was ever a huge Carradine fan but it gives you an idea of how I feel about this film. I feel bad for an actor known for largely being in mediocreatbest films because he was in it. And even then not for very long. Also while I'm thinking about it I think it's great to more away from the traditional zombie story every now and then but can we please stop pretending like this whole everyone has a virus except for a few people thing is new and fresh? The end result is the same as any old zombie movie so knock it off.What you essentially have here is the old small group of survivors who band together and dig in whilst under constant zombie attack. Well...not so much attack as constant zombie presence. I will give the movie props for one thing...I liked the way the zombies sort of evolve from just being corpses to rudimentary movement to being able to actually comprehend things. Of course that doesn't excuse a plot line that has virtually everyone in the country dropping dead simultaneously. I'm not sure what disease model they were working off of but that would have to be one hell of a virus. And I don't normally pick on technical aspects of movies but the audio in this was terrible. Maybe it was just the copy I had but everything that wasn't speech sounded loaded up with reverb. It was downright distracting and let's face it this movie didn't need any more strikes against it.All said and done you've seen this same type of film done better with less. It's not awful it just fails to really do much of anything. All of the characters pretty much fail to make you concerned about their wellbeing and the story itself just sort of drags along without for almost 2 hours...much longer than it needs to be. I won't say you should avoid it...that's your call...but I'm certainly not going to endorse it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sometimes I watch movies with David Carradine and think it's a shame that this will be part of his legacy. This is one of those films. Not that I was ever a huge Carradine fan but it gives you an idea of how I feel about this film. I feel bad for an actor known for largely being in mediocreatbest films because he was in it. And even then not for very long. Also while I'm thinking about it I think it's great to more away from the traditional zombie story every now and then but can we please stop pretending like this whole everyone has a virus except for a few people thing is new and fresh? The end result is the same as any old zombie movie so knock it off.What you essentially have here is the old small group of survivors who band together and dig in whilst under constant zombie attack. Well...not so much attack as constant zombie presence. I will give the movie props for one thing...I liked the way the zombies sort of evolve from just being corpses to rudimentary movement to being able to actually comprehend things.

In an American city Michael Dexter Fletcher saw his class of schoolkids die before his very eyes but is one of the few survivors after hearing some music on the radio he heads for the radio station where several other people are gathered drawn there by the music. Not knowing what happened everyone is scared  in a state of panic  at first decide to stick together but as the millions of dead bodies begin to rise  come back to life the fear of disease convinces several of them to head for the most isolated place they can find Michael Carl Dickon Tolson  Emma Lana Kamenov decide to live in a farmhouse in the country but more  more zombie gravitate there as they seem to regain their intelligence  soon the survivors realise they are after them...This Canadian production was coedited cowritten coproduced  directed by Steve Rumbelow  don't be fooled by the glowing comments that tell you not to be fooled by the negative comments that sort of makes sense as Autumn really does deserve all the bad press  bad reviews that it is getting  will undoubtedly continue to get as more  more people are unlucky enough to endure it's near two hour duration. Based on the novel by David Moody who cowrote the screenplay Autumn feels like so many much better apocalyptic end of the world type zombie films but without any of the horror or threat or budget. Autumn most closely resembles 28 Days Later... 2002 it's sequel 28 Weeks Later 2007  the Will Smith flick I Am Legend 2007 in the sense that the world population has been all but wiped out by some sort of virus or disease  a handful of survivors must fight hordes of zombies as well as figure out how to find food  secure shelter although there are bits of Night of the Living Dead 1968 as well with it's isolated farmhouse setting. Overall Autumn is a poor effort from supposedly good source material with poor character's who make stupid decisions  are just plain idiotic at times have none of them ever seen a zombie film before?  a plot which is never really explained  some poor scripting like the fence that keeps all the zombies out is only a flimsy wooden one that is only waist high so you could probably fall over it they don't seem to stock up on much food they don't seem bothered in getting any protection like guns  there are inconsistencies like these zombies are supposedly flesh eaters yet at the end one moment Michael can walk past them to turn the generator on yet seconds later they attack  kill Carl. At almost two hours in length it's really boring virtually nothing happens with a small number of people living in a farmhouse for the majority of the running time doing nothing in particular  a very sudden  abrupt climax which is always very frustrating unless it's some cool twist which this ain't. While the basic plot is alright it's nothing we haven't seen before  because the zombies don't become any sort of threat until the last third there's no tension  the film just plods along until a pointless David Carradine cameo  a crap ending.There are posts on the Autumn message board asking if this was filmed on a mobile phone  while I wouldn't be that cruel I can see where people are coming from as it looks really cheap  like it was shot on a camcorder with jerky handheld shakiness  bad colour  lighting. Personally I hate the look of video when it's this cheap  wish filmmakers would go back to using good old film. There's virtually no gore whatsoever since the zombie don't become killers until the second half of the film  even then they kill a poodle  that's about it apart from some scenes of people coughing up blood at the start  some poorly madeup zombies. Autumn tries to create a sense of apocalypse at the start  it show's one whole street wrecked which they keep showing throughout the film when the makers need to show some carnage  you can tell it's the same street because that bloody school bus parked across the train tracks is always there. There are no scares no tension no atmosphere  there's no sense of global disaster since we see so little of anything.Shot in Ontario in Canada the film looks bland  is badly made throughout as the zombie extras try desperately not to break the flimsy fence down merely by leaning on it! The acting is OK I can't believe Dexter Fletcher got involved with this although maybe he just wanted to see Canada  get paid for it but whats even more baffling is how the filmmakers persuaded the late David Carradine to appear in a bad cameo.Autumn is a apocalyptic end of the world seen it all before zombie flick that makes the fatal mistake of not having any killer zombies in it right up until the end at almost two hours most people will have a hard time staying awake through this one be it zombie horror or post apocalyptic fans.".

However this film whilst showing some degree of promise sadly tries just a bit too hard and reaches a little too far to attempt to make it an introspective look at blah blah blah and ends up just missing the mark completely. Worse still it misses the mark in numerous areas.IT IS PUT SIMPLY A ZOMBIE FILM  but for most of the film the 'zombies' aren't violent aren't 'out to get youyour flesh' etc they are just walking around aimlessly.... er OK. Eventually they become attracted by sound and then start to become aggressive at the source of that sound but they fail to ever be scary.... which a hundred corpses stood outside your house should be! And the makeup is very VERY amateur.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT  Nothing. None of the characters actually talks about themselves with each other  we have a few scenes before the virus hits of Dexter Fletcher as a teacher etc... but after the event we learn nothing about any of the survivors  no real development of anyone. One case in point out of MANY I could have chosen! is that there a two English guys there and not even the simplest of questions along the lines of where are you from what are you doing over here etc... nothing. ACTING  Badly delivered. No chemistry. People just reeling off line after line. Almost painful.Camera WORK  DIRECTION  EDITING  Is absolutely and utterly abysmal. Attempts to be far to arty with poorly written and delivered monologues over stills etc. Camera shaking a la NYPD Blue for no reason. Attempts at Sin Cityesquire 'neonoir' again for no reason. Its just a complete mess of unrelated styles none of which work. I don't want to watch footage of people learning what each button does which was hastily cobbled together with fades  freezeframes and even a wipe transition!OK I think that pretty much sums it up in my eyes. I still like Dexter Fletcher  always have ever since 'Press Gang'! but the film was poorly scripted poorly directed too arty with a cast of low rate actors and no for future reference David Carradine CANNOT save a film by having little more than a cameo!So I give it a 4  and feel I am being generous. I am sure it would be a good book but as it stands with direction this bad.. its definitely not a good film.".

According to the logic they should pick a fairly secure area where the awakening dead general bad guys and disease can't get to them easily. What do they do? They pick a farm out in the middle of no where that is easily breached..even by mindless corpses. I don't really care for Zombie type movies but these zombies are worthless. They are like wind up toys who run into buildings...ooohhh real scary.The main characters themselves are just stupid people. You constantly want to tell them they are doing it all wrong. I think an obvious solution to the zombies would be to setup a noise making device far away from where you live so they are attracted to it...but no that would be too easy. Why not make noises where you live and attract them. I'm sure they smell great and that's one reason to keep them around.One thing that was great was to see the same road shot over and over again with the same cars on it. It's even in the trailer.

Independent does not mean presold to lionsgate who agreed to fund a huge share of the budget therefore allowing the filmmakers to hire experienced DPs to shoot on brandy new Oakley Red packages. No no. Often this is what independent looks like requiring us viewers to look beyond the technical and into the heart of the story.On that note Autumn has an interesting approach to the Zombie genre in that the zombies start out very benign and not much of a threat at all becoming more and more of a danger as the movie marches on.The Live together or die alone theme isn't so awfully new to this genre but Autumn carries it well. Aside from the threesome we spend most of our screentime with the other characters quickly become footnotes. It's almost jarring when they show up again just to illustrate that they ultimately died horribly. It made me wish the screenwriter had employed the good sense to trimming those characters and devote more time to fleshing out the core.For me that was where the true failings of Autumn came into focus. There was almost enough character development to elevate the movie above typical entries into the zombie genre but not quite. It's clear that there is a great story with some really interesting character work laying beneath the veneer but ultimately the A.D.D. inspired beat choices win out.Still I would watch Autumn if zombie flicks are your thing.

	schema:reviewBody "It has to be said this movie is extremely low budget that has many plot holes and there isn't anything really consistent. Where the movie shines is having characters who you don't want to die. In many few against many horror movies there are some characters you just want to die. At least within this movie you empathize with the characters. The lighting in the movie is pretty dark giving it a home movie feel. Sometimes this works to good effect other times less so. Still there are a few scenes where you think something might happen and doesn't and others vice versa! From the Omega Man onwards there have been movies with trained personnel taking on the living dead to individuals. Again it was refreshing not to see a movie that everyone had to be tooled up to the nines and like Shaun of the Dead you could walk among them and not always been seen as a quick snack if you walked around slowly and quietly.The movie is very slow paced and doesn't use montages of what is on TV or a radio to learn how to kill or not the zombies. Additionally rather than having immediate flesh eating zombies the zombies seem to be passive at first and then violent later on in the movie. This gives this movie a different tact.Okay I've gone over the parts which I think it's different from others. Still I'd say there's nothing really new within the movie. We know the story Virus kills off billions a few people survive and get into the country and try and live in peace. But the zombies can find you and slowly they come in their masses! David Carodine I have NO idea why they got him into this low budget piece. They could have got anyone to play his part and in fact it'd probably have been better if they had. Like other comments here I thought it was painful to see him act. His role was kinda a fillin madman keeps zombies at bay and he's hiding a secret.There's some very good points raised in the movie about how to survive a holocaust and what next. Still the worst parts are found in the big plot holes. For example sometimes the zombies move superfast early in their development and then seem to forget that they had this ability! Next their development to eating flesh in live animals seems to again come earlier in the movie and then forgotten again.If you'd like to see a more dynamic take on humans in zombieland and have not seen the other likely suspects I'd give this one a try. But if you've seen 28 days later Romero's latest movies and maybe haven't seen this years best zombie flick Dead Snow I'd save your money on this and rent Dead Snow!".

	schema:reviewBody "Autumn fails on so many levels that it is hard to know where to begin so let's start with the successes The zombies are fairly believable. The decay and blood splattering isn't overdone I suppose the zombies haven't had long to decay. The first 20 or 30 minutes of the movie made me feel slightly nervous. I won't speculate as to why but it may not have been because the scene was set well...The film as released has so many failings. It is like a very poor workprint. The editing is badly timed not at all sharp. Sometimes scenes hang like something is about to happen and nothing does. This doesn't build tension it just makes you raise an eyebrow.Dream sequences are so badly signposted that you are not sure if you missed something or if the sequence is a dream or a bit of unassociated cutaway. The quality of the cinematography and lighting is very patchy. It's almost like they are trying to add comic book effect to some scenes although no other elements enhance or correlate with this and so it just looks badly done.The plot is so overdone now that it is a genre all of its own. 'Plague hits world people turn to zombies a few don't zombies chase and try to eat them.' The only variation in the genre really is if the people being chased survive or die. I've already forgotten what happened at the end and even at the time it wasn't too clear what the motivations were and what occurred. Really you need to tell a story within a genre not just sketch the genre out badly.The movie is unpacey unoriginal and uninteresting. There's nothing original. The movies really doesn't even make a point in the absence of a story. If someone told me that the writer had read 'I am Legend' and watched a few zombie flicks then made this film in the following two days I wouldn't be surprised. It is derivative in a very mundane way.There's not really even a main character to flesh out just 3 or 4 characters that come in and out of scenes and shots looking numb. There is no passion about the film no emotion that you can empathise with and very little solid acting. Why Carradine and Fletcher starred in it I do not know. But I can't believe either of them needed the money that much... Fletcher is the best of the bunch and if he'd have had some good lines to say or some good action to take part in he would no doubt have put in a decent showing. As it is I suspect the direction was lacking and he comes out as transparent rather than actively bad unlike the terrible 'mockney' second male lead. Carradine isn't very good. It's hard to know whether the director or actor are to blame.The sound is worse than many student movies I have seen where all the audio was from the on camera mic. Some sentences are barely heard or fade in and out. This sort of thing is only vaguely acceptable when the recording is supposed to be gonzo or at least hand held and effects mask some words. Even then it would be annoying but understandable.The whole film is like someone was told zombie flicks could be made well on a budget and didn't realise that they still had to have a selling point and some production values.I wanted to like this movie but I couldn't.".

It didn't bother me that it was totally cheaphomemade quality because many good zombie movies i have seen had cheap production values but because it made absolutely no sense. They give no answers at all the beginning was totally rushed just to get to the 80 minutes middle section in witch we see the same old stuff we saw 100's of times. The ending is as bad and even worse as the beginning of the movie. I want spend any more time to this just if you want an honest opinion of an ordinary viewer don't waste your time on this.".

The baby crying was very creepy the meat suits makeup was very realistic rather than the usual beaten and bloodied attack mode zombies. It was a good change finally someone tried to do something different than the the same stuff we've been seeing for how many decades? It was good to see how a body probably really looks when it's been rotting.Don't forget usually when this stuff gets leaked it's pretty much never the finished product and the finished product turns out way better. The preview version that played in Saskatoon is way better than the version that was leaked the leaked version isn't really great that's what happens when something isn't finished but hey the preview in Saskatoon was awesome and the completely finished version that will come out eventually I bet will probably be even better.".

The pacing is slow the plot virtually nonexistent the editing is atrocious the acting is mediocre at best I think the 'zombies' stole the show and they were terrible the 'special effects' are laughable and the ending is sudden and completely unrewarding.I decided to give this movie 210 because I believe that even though it deserves less a 110 should perhaps be saved for movies so bad that they are actually funny. But not this one. This was just painful to watch. I think I've summed up my feelings about this movie but just to elaborate why I think it was so bad  it was adapted from a book which I've not read so it's gone through 2 entirely separate stages where someone with an ounce of common sense and judgement should have said No this is awful. You aren't getting this publishedfilmed. And yet somehow it made it through both.And finally..David Carradine. His inclusion in the movie was brief and extremely pointless as well. His scenes should have been edited out so as to not further tarnish his career posthumously.As a 'zombie' film a thriller and a horror movie this fails on every level. It truly looks like a halfbaked student film and not the work of a supposed seasoned professional take a look at Mr Rumbelow's biography to see what I mean. Avoid this at all costs unless you feel like wasting an hour or 2 of your life.".

In a movie like this the producers don't pay expensive actors to act or to create realistic performances or to use their talents to win our sympathy. No they pay these actors for face and name recognition so when a movie like Ballistic Banderas vs Liu comes along we don't have the inconvenience of learning about characters and plot. Hell we don't even have the inconvenience of wondering Is this actor hot while all this excitement rushes them by? Name recognition baby it's all marketed by name recognition.And why should they let actors acting take up precious moments from the rooftop chases the explosions the gunfire and posing like models? Everyone already knows these actors right? No need to develop anything more than flimsy excuses for actionmotivation right? Sarcasm aside  I never thought I'd hear myself say this but I think Ballistic would have been a better more sophisticated film if they scrapped the plot and clich character developments and just went for 90 minutes of uninterrupted Banderas and Liu gunning at each other backdropped by a slowmo explosions.This film would have to scale a cliff before reaching the level of plot intricacies and intelligence that just thrive in Michael Bay films.We get a crappy plot and crappy characterizations anyway just in case we don't have a favorite actor to root for. We get ultra clich scenarios that anyone who has been to a theatre in the last fifty years will pick up on. Oh no a child's been kidnapped  we're supposed to sympathize with the boy. There's the old young? hasbeen former cop FBI guy in this movie who lost his motivation  we're supposed to sympathize with him and the loss of his family. And then there'soh but wait? What are these plot revelations? What are they pointing towards? Gasp! They're making the already obvious villain even more obvious! Me? I was rooting for the aliens from Independence Day to come down and blow them all up but the bastards got stuck in traffic.Somewhere in the movie is a subplot about a nanoassassin but I cared about that as much as the movie does.And since we're being honest I admit this is a great film to watch after a night of provocative and cultured cinema to recalibrate your personal scale to the realities of the industry. Like I explained to the guy at Blockbuster I just got a boxset of Hitchcock been watching those back to back and the other day I watched De Palma's Femme Fatale. I need something trashy before I become a fullblown film snob. So I walked out with Ballistic and Shark Attack 3 went home and turned off my mind for a marathon of stock footage and needless gunfireexplosions . . . and all was well.".

	schema:headline " absurdly bad espionage thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Ballistic Ecks vs. Sever' has been saddled with not only one of the worst movie titles in recent memory but one of the worst screenplays as well. The film's thirdrate espionage plot makes no sense at all and serves basically as a lame excuse for endless explosions shootouts and doubleflipping car chases which have become the standard accoutrements for virtually every action picture since Bullitt' in 1968. The problem with Ballistic' is that the viewer can never tell who is doing what to whom or why  and we never care.   The film is really all about style anyway.  How else to account for the rather ludicrous image of Lucy Liu  looking more like a fashion model out on a shoot than a trained killer doing the shooting herself   strolling in elegant slow motion through the streets of Vancouver wiping out what seems to be an entire hit squad with a combination of superhuman marksmanship and Matrixlike kickboxing moves? With her anklelength designer coat and her icycool demeanor she looks like Calvin Klein's idea of what the welldressed assassin should be wearing this season.  It's enough to reduce the whole enterprise to the level of comic absurdity  and indeed I often found myself laughing out loud at many of the ostensibly serious shenanigans occurring in the film.  The flashbacks which are obviously intended to clarify the characters' relationships are so poorly done that they actually end up making the whole story more muddled and confusing. And although the childkidnapping scenario is never as offensive in this film as it is in Trapped' one can still question the propriety of filmmakers running to this theme with the kind of frequency they seem to have been doing of late.Antonio Banderas makes up the other half of the film's title he is Ecks she Sever and one only wonders what he could have been thinking about when he signed on to costar in this particular project.  Ballistic' is utterly dispensable moviemaking  here today forgotten tomorrow a film utterly without distinction conviction or purpose.".

This movie hurts on so many levels that it could be considered a cruel and inhuman torture to be made to sit through this. Everything about this movie screams bargain bin. With the exception of one scene see below this movie pretty much blows. Antonio Banderas is absolutely useless in this picture. You'd think from the ad campaign let alone the fact that the movie is titled Ecks vs. Sever that he would be more of a serious ass kicker. No no. The only one who gets to do any serious ass kicking is Lucy Liu and I'm 100 positive that she did this one only to pay the bills. Even with that revelation she still sucked in it. The direction is pretty much what you'd expect from someone who goes by the name Kaos but sometimes I'd like a little order to my chaos ya know? I read a quote somewhere where they said 'who knew so much action could be so boring?' That's definitely the case here. Yeah there's a lot of action but it's of the directtovideo variety. God help me but this movie sucked. It wasn't even of the so bad it's good type of flick. The story is incomprehensible something about microscopic termites and little babies blown to smithereens and wives that bounce on you and the guy from Payback and.... AARRRRGGGHHH!!! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I can't recommend this to anyone. I'll give it a 12 out of  ONLY and I repeat ONLY because of the aforementioned scene where some guy is knocked off of a rooftop by a grenade launcher and is shown falling to his death onto a parked car.

I find it difficult to express why I disliked this film as much as I did without expressly pointing out key scenes and events that made me cringe while attempting to enjoy a thoughtless summer film. I did approch this film as just that. I am a guy who likes a thoughtless action film more often than not. I love thoughtful ones but the thoughtless ones can truly be fun. xXx comes to mind. I was expecting something along those lines when I came to see Ballistic. What it turned out to be was a number of explosions that seemed to occur for no reason what so ever. To say there was little plot bringing these explosions together is a given. That comes with the territory but in this case the reasons are even below the lowest C movie in quality. No one reacts to an event the way you'd expect a normal human being to react. In fact the two main characters were so devoid oh personality I have come to wonder whether or not they were both blackmailed into performing the roles. I'm used to Lucy Liu not showing any on screen personality but Antonio consistently show's his Latin Lover charm. Not here. spoilers begin below Everyone is out to get Lucy Liu. No one seems to know where to find her. In fact they need to draw an FBI agent 7 years out of retirement to capture her. His groundbreaking method of investigation is to sit in a car listen to a radio and carry on dull conversations with secondary characters. Meanwhile across town Lucy Liu is walking in circles for no reason in a coffee bar. The bad guys know this and have snipers set up all over the place that would make the Kennedy assassination look like amateur night. How is it that they don't know where she hides out but knows when and where she's going to walk in circles? After giving the order not to hurt her immediately all snipers try to kill her and  an overly armed SWAT team hit's the scene. By overly armed I mean they have grenade launchers and heavy machineguns all designed to kill as many innocent bystanders as possible. In fact the FX crew even botched the way rifle mounted grenade launches work and turned them into mini rocket launchers. But fear not they don't use them. They are just there for Lucy to pick up and level 12 city blocks with. I often wondered how it is if she were so professional she'd stand in one place and take on an army rather than just slip away in the crowd.Once the mayhem is complete Antonio arrives glances at a few bullet holes and declares that the FBI should pick up and not investigate the devastation because she's not done here.' I was able to relate to the FBI assistant directors baffled expression in this scene because I wouldn't know what to say to one of my agents who asked me to pull out all of my investigators cause the criminal might be coming back. Wouldn't you want to catch her?Skipping ahead to what I assume is the largest injustice here. Antonio finds his wife to learn that for the past 7 years she was in bed with the big bad guy of the film. Married to him in fact. He confronts her in an aquarium while she is contentedly looking at whales which must be where she goes whenever her son is kidnapped and threatened to be killed within 12 hours. And she also proceeded to have Antonio's son who has been raised by her and the man who1 Tried to hill Antonio's character.2 Faked the death of himself and Antonio's wife in an effort to have her to himself'. Which evidently worked for 7 years.When confronted she reveals that she had knowledge that Antonio was not dead and in fact always really loved him and not the big villain. She only stayed with him to protect their son'. By having the son live with this guy? Give me a break! But what's worse is Antonio's reaction. He instantly understands and forgives her. No anger no slap for her lack of logic. It's all OK. Lets go get the bad guy now. Honestly that ended the film for me. I was through.".

Lots and lots of explosions and fun action there were more explosions then dialouge. There is some plot here but don't watch this for realism or story. It's a cartoon a video game just mindless action and entertainment and thats why its worth seeing and doesn't belong on the bottom 100.It doesn't come close to being a must see action flick see the first 2 Lethal Weapons Die Hard Escape from New York or dozens of others but it's not that bad.".

Actually I enjoyed it but I was in the mood to not think and just watch stuff blow up having a bad day. That's what I got. Lots and lots of explosions and fun action there were more explosions then dialouge. There is some plot here but don't watch this for realism or story. It's a cartoon a video game just mindless action and entertainment and thats why its worth seeing and doesn't belong on the bottom 100.It doesn't come close to being a must see action flick see the first 2 Lethal Weapons Die Hard Escape from New York or dozens of others but it's not that bad.";

The film is certainly pointless loaded with ridiculous plot twists and absurd action sequences but how many action films don't fit this description? Seriously if you want to see what two entertaining actors and a lot of wasted film can do together this film is worth a look. it's plot heavy bit soulless and clichd but entertaining nonetheless.I turned it on at 3AM one sleepless night because I wanted to see what the heck Liu and Banderas were doing in a direct to video film. Expecting a thoroughly dreadful film I was pleasantly surprised and found the film to be entertaining. The film views like a series of strung together early80s MTV videos with a contemporary hard rock sound track plenty of loud noises and explosions and thankfully few words.To the extent that I remember it the plot was about Banderas trying to rescue his wife and son from the clutches of some very evil supersecret spy types who are nevertheless apparently exceedingly inept. A lot of stuff got blown up  in fact most of the sets were heavily rigged with explosives which seemed to go off at random intervals. Of course there were a lot of gunshots fists and kicks. I don't recall any swords or phasers though. If I say anything about Lucy Liu at all I will give away the rest of the plot which ought to tell you something about the quality of the script and the complexity of the plot Lighten up! It's bad but it's just a B movie. And this is what B movies are supposed to be about.

Sure Lucy Liu beats up a lot of people... but her character is so boring and emotionless that she doesn't come off as cool as she should have.  I mean she barely says a word throughout the whole movie.  Yes lines DO matter in an action film.  It all plays out like a video game... and I can see why it was intended to be one.  They should'nt have made a movie out of it though.  Avoid this one at all costs unless you're too easily pleased.".

The only two things Ballistic had going for it were the presence of some rarelyseen hardware fun for you firearms buffs and some spectacular action sequences though these were plagued by some annoying clichs such as a protective vest preventing all injury to a character and henchmen showing complete disregard for personal safety and these were simply not enough to save this turkey.

This way of acting suits them both excellently and creates an attractive ambient atmosphere energized by their martial encounters and growing mutual sympathy.The bad guys Gregg Henry as Gant and Ray Park as his right hand Ross do not contribute a whole lot to this movie. Gant is the sinistersmugselfabsorbed crook which Gregg also embodied as Val Resnick in Payback and Ross' vocabulary is annoyingly redundant particularly his constant use of the euphemism 'cancel' one might be inclined to blame this on the script but more subtle acting could have pulled it off by not emphasizing 'cancel' each time.Perhaps what I like most about this movie is that Lucy has a major role. In her other movies she is mostly spice to the plot although Lucky Number Slevin does allow her personality to surface. To me Ballistic is the best Lucymovie. She makes a very lovely femme fatale even agonizingly crisp in a catsuit.Do not watch this movie if you consider lack of dialog synonymous with shallow acting or if you are just not a fan of lowkey acting. If on the other hand you enjoy good atmosphere in a movie Ballistic may be one of those you want to return to from time to time.I give it a low 7 and would have gone higher if the feel of the movie were not occasionally fractured by the Gant and Ross characters.".

Ballistic fails to follow even that which explains why the film bored the hell out of me.  I'm almost hesitant to say this but the latest straighttovideo JeanClaude Van Damme schlock might actually be better than Ballistic which was arguably 2002's worst film I've never seen Rollerball.There's something of a plot here but I'm not entirely sure what the hell was going on.  Antonio Banderas plays FBI Agent Ecks Lucy Liu is Agent Sever and the two of them are duking it out because they somehow have crossed paths with a wealthy man Gregg Henry who is determined to smuggle a small electronic device that can assassinate its intended victim via heart attack.   Mixed up in it all is Talisa Soto as Banderas' supposedly dead wife only she's not really dead.  Much mayhen ensues.Ballistic is directed by Kaos a Thai filmmaker who apparently wanted his movies to live up to his name.  This is his first American feature and he shows almost no ability in crafting an action sequence.  Martial arts fights that should get the adrenalinepumping are so stiltedly choreographed it'll inspire either laughs or yawns.  Kaos also goes overboard on the slow motion ensuring there's never an opportunity for the fight scenes to build momentum.  And this is the only film I can think of where the people involved in a car chase actually follow the speed limit!I feel a bit sorry for the cast here particularly Lucy Liu whose martial arts talents are squandered here.  To date she hasn't been much of an actress but she looks and convincingly acts tough so such a role here must have seemed like a good idea.  For Banderas this is the third film where he has trouble with mysterious women.  I've heard of typecasting but never to such a ridiculous extent.  The only thing keeping this guy's career afloat is Robert Rodriguez and that Spy Kids franchise.".

Watch her as she runs through anunderground parking garage in one scene. She runs with her mouth closed just like that liquid terminator played by Robert Patrick in T2. Watch Antonio Banderas race around on a motorcycle without a helmet on. I was very surprised they let him do that.This movie screams sequel to me. I hope they have one using the same cast and director. One small detail.

	schema:reviewBody "Thailandborn film director Wych Kaosayananda pulls out all stops in his first English language actioneer Ballistic Ecks Vs. Sever a fastpaced slambang highoctane revengethriller that pits Hispanic heartthrob Antonio Banderas against Asian beauty Lucy Liu of Charlie's Angels fame. Kaosayananda who made Fah the highest moneymaking movie of all time in Thailand has since slashed his multisyllabic moniker to Kaos. Not only does this talented Asian action helmer live up to his alias but also Ballistic traces the trajectory of its title with a pyrotechnical frenzy. Our clenchjawed hero our longhaired heroine and a multitude of disposable but dastardly SWATstyle villains brandish a formidable arsenal of firepower ranging from auto pistols to submachineguns to rocket launchers and unleash inexhaustible barrages of bullets in slowmotion for more than an hour with barely a word of dialogue. Moreover when these onedimensional archetypes aren't shooting up everything in sight they resort to either kicking butt martial arts style a la The Matrix or demolishing dozens of cars buses SUVs and railway freight cars. Although none of this nonsense remains remotely original Ballistic delivers more than enough gunplay to compensate for its prefabricated cookiecutter plot about rival assassins.Cast as a disillusioned but fashionably disheveled exGMan named Jeremiah Ecks Antonio Banderas wears a single expression throughout Ballistic as nondescript as his rainsodden trench coat. According to the melodramatic bulletriddled screenplay by Alan McElroy whose credits include Spawn and Rapid Fire Ecks quit the Bureau after his wife died in an explosion seven years ago. Ecks nurses a drink in a dimlylit bar with rain dripping off his trench coat when his former Agency boss Julio Martin Miguel Sandoval of Mrs. Winterbourne drops in and informs him that his dead wife is alive. Martin refuses to divulge the details until Ecks retrieves a microscopic assassination device from bad guy Robert Gant Payback's Gregg Henry which can be injected into a person's bloodstream and kill them when activated. Meanwhile Gant faces troubles of his own when Sever Lucy Liu abducts his young son Michael Aidan Drummond and spirits him off to her Batcave of sorts where she hordes more hardware than most women have shoes. As an exDIA agent trained as an assassin because she was an orphan Sever bears a grudge against Gant for killing her only child. When Gant isn't dodging Ecks and Sever he contends with his griefstricken wife Rayne Talisa Soto of License To Kill who fears for her son's life.Ballistic doesn't pretend to be anything more than a 70million Bmovie thriller. McElroy and Koas waste no more than a minute or two on expository dialogue before they load up this ode to the NRA and open fire. The taciturn cast spends more time ducking lead and spinning drop kicks than they do acting. One interesting shot shows a wounded villain plummeting backwards off a building to smash into a car beneath him. What makes the shot so fascinating is that we get to watch him as he falls without any cuts. As Gant's secondincommand Ray Parks shows off his considerable martial arts expertise. Previously Parks appeared in George Lucas's The Phantom Menace as Darth Maul and as Toad in XMen. Round for round Ballistic contains more than enough violent action and plot reversals to keep its audiences enthralled during its lean mean 91 minute running time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before stepping into acting this was Sohail's first directorial movie. But it did flop with an immature story old plots and overaction scenes. Yes though it can be considered as movie for commercial purposes but many bugs and small mistakes are visible while watching it. From Anu Malik's side it was a good effort to present good and earrelaxing music. That's why the songs are not that negligible and are worth listening. Exceptional to one song 'Dil Le Lena' which he entirely copied from Macarena by Los Del Rio.I like Auzaar only for the story of Suraj Salman and Yash Sanjay who are good friends and can do anything for their strong friendship sake. Only difference is that Suraj is from a village and Yash is from a rich criminal father. Also Yash has a girlfriend Prathna shilpa while Suraj remains bachelor till the end of the movie. Suddenly in between their friendship story Suraj leaves for his village. He returns with a secret mission and hiding his identity from all. What is that secret mission and his identity?The movie can be considered as 'zabardast masaladar' but again with too much 'masala' also spoils the recipe. Such is the case with Auzaar. Only tasty while watching it but forget after it gets end. Sometimes it's hard to digest. Paresh Rawal is always evergreen for every role he is offered and here also it is not exceptional. His role as Yash's handicapped father is excellent which proves that he is fit for every role beside comedian.A great regret for Sohail is that his first directorial debut went in vain without success. He improved better with his second movie Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya which was somewhat delicious.".

Sears gets right down to business and features the music throughoutwith wonderful mostly mimed performances by Bill Haley of his classic early Decca recordings which still rock out today. Also seen are the pioneering loungerocknroll band Freddie Bell and His Bellboys who were fine entertainers in the Louis Prima vein and who provided Elvis with Hound Dog. A plot is woven into the film here and there to keep things moving but the emphasis is on the music. Haley's friendly persona comes across well in his limited dialogue scenes and the other characters in his band such as sax player Rudy Pompilli are quite animated capturing a bit of what his live shows must have been like probably much wilder than this film. Alan Freed also appears and is worked into the plot and the Platters sing their two biggest hits. All together it's an excellent time capsule into the early days of rock'n'roll and it's a wonderful showcase for the great Bill Haley who still has not received his due as a music pioneer. It's easy to see why the film caused riots when shown overseas. Don't miss it if you like Haley Freed and the glory days of rocknroll.".

Haley's friendly persona comes across well in his limited dialogue scenes and the other characters in his band such as sax player Rudy Pompilli are quite animated capturing a bit of what his live shows must have been like probably much wilder than this film. Alan Freed also appears and is worked into the plot and the Platters sing their two biggest hits. All together it's an excellent time capsule into the early days of rock'n'roll and it's a wonderful showcase for the great Bill Haley who still has not received his due as a music pioneer. It's easy to see why the film caused riots when shown overseas. Don't miss it if you like Haley Freed and the glory days of rocknroll.";

This movie is so special not only because it showcases rock  roll's important early performers but also its place in musical time  right at the pop music transition from the big bands to the much smaller combos. In fact the term combo was apparently not in popular use yet. In the film these small rock  roll bands are referred to as combinations of musicians. And the dancing was a joy to watch! Influences from the Big Band era were still strong as couples did variations of swing and jitterbug with the brand new additions of nontouch formula steps that later led to the Twist the Mashed Potato and all the rest right up to the present time when almost no one knows how to dance together as a couple. This film should be required viewing for anyone following the history of postWorld War II popular music and the end of the big bands.".

This shows Bill Hlaey and the Comets and the Platters performing and that alone makes this a valuable time capsule of the 1950s when rock and roll was starting to get popular. The groups ARE lip syncing to their songs and pretty badly in the case of The Platters but still... When the Platters sang Only You and The Great pretender this movie is just magic. The acting is pretty terrible Bill Haley especially but the songs are good the movie is short and the dance routines between Barton and Gaye are really pretty impressive. Hard to believe that this was banned in some cities in the US when it first came out. In other cases some theatre owners told the projectionist to cut the sound when the music numbers came on! Check out the ending which says The Living End! Harmless and kind of fun. I give it a 6.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this movie a lifeless and somewhat ridiculous plot acts as a frame story to showcase some rockandroll bands when that kind of music was becoming popular in the 1950s. Young people in their rebellious stage like to shock their elders so naturally we have a scene in which Bill Haley and the Comets perform at a prestigious and very proper girls' school which scandalizes the matronly chaperones. The Comets wear suits and are cleancut singing songs without suggestive lyrics but no matter because the beat alone is indecent. So the movie has it both ways allowing teenagers to enjoy the fantasy of shocking their elders while the real elders watching the movie in the theaters would be reassured that rock and roll was quite harmless.Part of the plot of this movie is that dancing is on its way out by which is meant ballroom dancing. But the dancing done by teenagers to rock and roll is alive and well. It is basically jitterbug also known as swing boogiewoogie and the bop. In a sense however this died too. Once the twist became popular in the early 1960s partner dancing in which couples make contact with each other pretty much came to an end to be replaced by various forms of free style in which couples never touch each other. To see partner dancing any more you either have to go to a countrywestern nightclub or to a dance studio where ballroom still lingers on.Partner dancing in the movies is one of two kinds either the dancers are professionals or they are just barely able to shuffle around the dance floor. The reality would be somewhere in between with amateurs doing a fairly decent job of cutting a rug. In this movie the brother and sister who dance together are obviously professionals. They become part of the act with the Comets the idea being that they will show teenagers at the performances how to dance to rock and roll to break the ice and get others on the dance floor. Of course all those supposedly novice teenagers who venture onto the dance floor are professional dancers themselves. In fact having that brotherandsister team dance like that in real life would intimidate ordinary wouldbe dancers making it less likely for them to get out on the floor.Unfortunately most of the songs performed in this movie are not that good and in several cases no one dances at all usually because the beat is too fast even for professionals. There are a couple of good numbers from the Comets and a couple from the Platters. The rest are mediocre which when combined with the boring plot make the movie a disappointment.".

In fact having that brotherandsister team dance like that in real life would intimidate ordinary wouldbe dancers making it less likely for them to get out on the floor.Unfortunately most of the songs performed in this movie are not that good and in several cases no one dances at all usually because the beat is too fast even for professionals. There are a couple of good numbers from the Comets and a couple from the Platters. The rest are mediocre which when combined with the boring plot make the movie a disappointment.";

There's a rough backstory to connect the musical spots which may also offer some insight into the industry circa 1955. Otherwise the story is standard romantic stuff. The movie's release date indicates that brief period between RR's inception and Elvis's meteoric rise and so is unusual in that regard. One questionwhy the recurring dance act Gaye  Barton? They're good lively dancers but didn't the producers think the new beat was enough. Anyway to my knowledge this was the first RR movie and a good opportunity to view the style in its preElvis period.".

Introducing them to Talton Freed wants to make them stars but the only gig they get is a literal dance for squares at an all girls school where the stuffy faculty wants no part of the boomin rock and roll industry. But going against the school officials demands the comets become a smash when they begin to swing. Their success doesn't convince Talton to book them in premier clubs and it seems like their success will not happen. But thanks to Freed and his plan to get them a big gig Talton's efforts go unsuccessful.While the music here certainly is great with the Comets performing the title song and other hits and a brief appearance by the Platters there is something about this it just doesn't swing as far as true history is concerned. Big bands certainly were still around in the mid 1950's and maybe if not making the top of the charts they were certainly still successful. Even with the slight story however it is pretty fast moving and entertaining film. There seems to be no motivation on Talton's efforts to put out the Comet's fire before it even lights up. The only thing I can guess is that the writers wanted to show her at the power hungry females who love being able to make or break musicians and this doesn't really give her character some motivation. So watch this for the music if not the story or accuracy and you might just lying there a passable time filler.".

In a film with a bigger budget they would have gotten Eve Arden for the role. She gives the film whatever verve it has acting wise.But it's the musical acts that the moviegoing public was putting down its money to see. This must have been a big drivein movie attraction back in 1956. The young folk could just get out of their cars and dance and probably not pay attention to whatever plot the film has.Ironically the man who was searching for that new sound made his living with the old sound. Johnny Johnston was a much married singer who came up around the same time Frank Sinatra did but with hardly as much success. He sings not a note in a film that marked the end of performers like him unless they had Sinatra like reputations.For fans of the early rock and roll era and rock and roll certainly proved it was here to stay.".

The young folk could just get out of their cars and dance and probably not pay attention to whatever plot the film has.Ironically the man who was searching for that new sound made his living with the old sound. Johnny Johnston was a much married singer who came up around the same time Frank Sinatra did but with hardly as much success. He sings not a note in a film that marked the end of performers like him unless they had Sinatra like reputations.For fans of the early rock and roll era and rock and roll certainly proved it was here to stay.";

Bill Haley and his comets are outstanding in what should be officially recognised as part of Movie history. The first ever rock n roll film to be made maybe a bit thin on the plot line but makes up for it with its exciting dance scenes and thumping jumping music. Some previous comments have said they found the Lisa Gaye and Johnny Johnston characters age gap to be creepy. I didn't have a problem with this at all as lots of young women married older men during the forties and fifties. Lisa Gaye was over 21 and Johnston was in his early thirties when the film was shot. Rock around the Clock is now out on DVD not sure about the UK yet and looks splendid in a remastered and restored edition that is well worth buying. Check out Earl Barton as Lisa's brother and dancing partner. Barton actually choreographed all the dance scenes and at the time was a much respected Hollywood choreographer. I'm giving this film a ten out of ten Daddio as it was the first and the best of the rock and roll films made during the fifties.".

He also booked Freddie Bell and His Bellboys and The Platters for additional appeal. I wonder if this was the only time the latter group performed their hits Only You and The Great Pretender for the big screen. It's mainly for what I cited above as well as being the first time that this was a picture that showcased Rock 'n' Roll nearly in its entirety that would give it interest today. Otherwise it's just a mostly bland plot about a manager trying to give Haley and his combo their big break with complications like his former female manager girlfriend vs. his current one in teenage dancer Lisa Gaye. Seeing him and Lisa suddenly kiss after just meeting gave me the creeps! Also the guy who coined the new music sound's name Alan Freed does his introductions when the acts come on. So on that note Rock Around the Clock is well worth a look. Oh and unlike the end of The Blackboard Jungle when the title song here ended the movie there was no Big Band flourish to finish it. P.S. While the one other musical act Tony Martinez and His Band are good too it's obvious thatas the plot impliedthey have a different appeal possibly to the potential squares in the audience.

A big bank robbery did take place on Baker Street in 1971 culprits never found money never recovered. After initial big headlines the story disappeared from the newspapers. 2. There was serious police corruption in London in the 1970s cops on payrolls of drug dealers and pornographers.3. Princess Margaret was involved in a series of affairs some caught on compromising photos which were not published by the otherwise relentlessly sensational British press under the DNotice rule. 4. There was a militant British blackpower advocate called Michael X involved in a oneman multicountry crime wave. In 1971 John Lennon paid for Michael X's bail something not mentioned in the film.The Bank Job director Roger Donaldson of No Way Out brings together all these true threads in a way that may be true even in its totality director and cast prevailing over some shoddy work from too many writers. The content is all true the context is excitingly possible. Did the government in trying to prevent exposure of Princess Margaret by evidence in Michael X's possession mastermind the bank robbery? Was MI5 or MI6 says a policeman in the film I never remember which is which involved and actually assisting the robbers? Again possibly. The cast is remarkable Jason Statham is the ringleader the bad guy of Transporter and The Italian Job turning into a scourge of the really bad guys. Saffron Burrows James Spader's vamp nemesis on Boston Legal brings her remarkable name and looks to the criminally and emotionally ambiguous major female role.Peter De Jersey is a totally scary Michael X David Poirot Suchet is a frightening crime lord and a whole host of top British stage actors fill in big roles and small ones. Don't be misled by reviews speaking of a soso thriller  The Bank Job is a great deal more than that even to the point that you may want to see it more than once.".

Now this movie is based on a true story it's based in the 1970'sbonus it doesn't remind you every 10 minutes and it's about just amateur robbers that pulled off one of the largest heists in England's history with finding corrupt cops and ending badly.Martine Love approaches Terry Leather an amateur thief and long time friend.

Terry and his group successfully break into the vault and takes four million pounds including jewelery cash bonds and some extremely private and damaging photos of the mobsters and government of England. When the group just about gets away with it things go terribly wrong when one of the members are captured and they found out there was an alterer motive to this heist.The Bank Job has great acting terrific editing and is just a great thriller that truly keeps your attention. Jason Statham this guy has never really stood out to me as someone who could be a good actor most of his movies could never display what he could do but The Bank Job is without a doubt his finest role to date that I'm aware of he pulls the part off well and makes the story more real.

	schema:headline " Slow beginning but brilliant pay off";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll be honest I only saw The Bank Job because I had some free tickets for an advance screening had I have not got these tickets I would not have bothered seeing it. The only trailer I had saw for it just didn't really appeal to me I do enjoy Jason Statham movies but this one seemed a bit serious in my eyes. Still I went today to the 6.30 screening and was surprised to enjoy it quite as much as I did. Admittedly for the first half hour I did get quite bored the characters weren't really memorable and the set up seemed really dull. Thankfully when the heist gets under way and especially the aftermath the movie hits top gear and left me thrilled. The fact the movie is based on a true story still leaves me quite amazed as the events that happen seem purely like the stuff that you see in the movies. How much of it is real and how much of it is purely to make it a better movie a fight involving Statham I am certain didn't happen. The performances are surprisingly well rounded Statham doing a brilliant job and the majority of the supporting cast getting some great scenes. Alas the movie does start to fall apart under close inspection the plot is never concluded quite as well as I would have liked and the movie does have some long stretches where not a lot is happening. If you can overlook this fact then you will a lot to enjoy in this very well made movie.So onto the performances. As I have said Statham does a surprisingly admirable job in the film. When you look at his CV of films you realise he isn't exactly the most talented actor. In fact all he generally has to do is grumble and hit things a lot. But there is just no denying that the man has a hell of a lot of charisma in this film he truly gets to display his acting skills. Of course on occasion he delivers a dodgy line but then if you watch some of the smaller scenes with his characters wife you realise how much potential he has. If given the right material I am sure Statham can truly develop as an actor. Saffron Burrows is brilliant as the slightly suspicious Martine for the first half unfortunately after the heist she has little to do and the character never felt fully concluded. Still she does have some great moments in the earlier part of the film. Daniel Mays runs off with the majority of the movie as Dave in fact this looks set to launch Mays career a bit further he has the best lines and is a funny character. Richard Lintern who I have to confess I thought was Dougray Scott for half the film is brilliant as the man behind the heist in some way that is and his character is one of the most rounded. Peter De Jersey as Michael X is menacing in his all too brief screen time but like Martine his character never felt fully dealt with. Still he and the other chief villain David Suchet are quite menacing.The Bank Job when advertised does come across as a typical gangster flick with a lot of humour in it. However when watching it I have to be honest and say it isn't that funny. There are a couple of lines here and there but the movie doesn't really make you laugh that much. Neither is it that big of a gangster flick of course there are the local gangster running around and the movie becomes more along that line towards the end. But for the majority of the film it comes across as a slightly grittier and far less flashy Ocean's Eleven. The scenes where they try to rob the bank are definitely some of the highlights however its the final 45 minutes that stick firmly in mind. What happens after the robbery is just thrilling to watch will they get away with it won't they? Things also get a lot darker near the end also quite violent one scene or the idea of what was going to happen made me wince a bit. The film is superbly directed as well its not too flashy but there are some great shots in there. Unfortunately the music does start to irritate after a while everything seems overdone a scene which is meant to be funny is ruined because the music sounds like its from an action movie it just doesn't truly suit the film all the time. Also as previously mentioned the beginning as well is quite boring.Overall The Bank Job is a great movie that with a bit of fine tuning at the beginning could make it even better. If you want a smart thriller that will surprise you because of it being based on real events that I highly recommend this. Don't expect an all time classic though.".

	schema:headline " Above Average Caper Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "As caper flicks go all I really hope for is something that succeeds in being both novel and entertaining. My hopes were satisfied by The Bank Job. The plot itself is based very loosely on events that occurred in the 1970s in London. The royal family has some dark secrets. An outspoken activistpetty criminaldrug importer has evidence of these secrets which he uses as leverage against the government who desperately wants to prosecute him. This evidence is stored in a safety deposit box within a London bank. British Intelligence conjures up a rather reckless plan of employing a bunch of twobitamateur criminals to break into the vault and take the evidence along with whatever else they can carry out. Apart from one intermediary none of the robbers know the government's secret agenda. Of course things get complicated whenever the possibility that a bunch of dirty secrets are in the wrong hands and eventually the movie juggles several interconnecting plot lines all related to the contents of the vault and their implication on various interests from the royal family to corrupt police to the sexual indiscretions of parliament members.The movie keeps a good pace and never takes itself too seriously. It builds up the plot lines and tries somewhat successfully to tie everything together. There is some good tension a bit of violence not much and eventually vindication for most of the parties.The problems with the movie are numerous but nothing that ultimately destroys the fun. Yes the movie is rife with inexplicably unnecessary side characters see female undercover agent in the Caribbean. Yes the movie's dialogue veers into indecipherable 1970s British slang which gives a comedic undertone to conversations that are intended to be serious. Yes there exist rampant plot issues that make you wonder how stupid cops really are. And yes the acting is OK at best lets face it Jason Stracham is meant for British caper movies the way Keanu Reeves is meant to play a clueless surfer cop in Point Break  so while he's not winning any Academies he fits these rolls just fine.You could wait for the DVD or if you are looking for a fun way to kill 2 hours you should go to the theater for this one.".

It might not have massive appeal outside the UK however it is a good based on fact story.

	schema:reviewBody "Sporting complex consequences for a relatively straightforward plot The Bank Job remains intriguing throughout as each setup leads to ever more suspenseful twists for the likable group of ragtag antiheroes. Overthorough character introductions cause a slower build in the early stages of the heist but such complications likely arise from fewer liberties taken with the based on a true story events and the result is a fascinating look at criminals the corrupt and those least guilty.It is 1971 in East London and a fateful bank robbery begins to take shape. In order to remove the threat of radical gangster Michael X government officials devise a plan to rob a bank on Baker Street and retrieve damning photographs from his possession. To keep the heist untraceable back to them an independent group of thieves led by car dealer Terry Jason Statham and the cunning Martine Saffron Burrows are unwittingly thrown into a deadly battle against corrupt officials and London's criminal underworld.Jason Statham isn't your typical leading man yet ever since Guy Ritchie's early films he has managed to keep coming back with bigger and better roles and is now thought of as an action film star. However it's here in darker thrillers that he finds a more sincere presence especially as thief and scoundrel Terry. Each moral flaw creates a more dimensional character and one worth rooting for.The language of the film is genuinely intriguing as it captures wonderfully wry British slang. Cheeky sod 12inch mutton dagger a bit of bother usual skullduggery and things turning acustard are but a few of the verbal jousts that occur between the main characters. Devoid of euphuisms these apparently authentic words make the dialogue a particularly potent piece of the puzzle.The entire subplot about Michael X and his blackmailing of the British government is useful in its supposed tie to facts but as filmed scenes in the movie they are hardly necessary. Photographs of a princess caught in the act of promiscuity are at the root of the blackmail plot which then goes on to include further damaging materials from Sonia Bern's brothel also of factual importance but equally unnecessary in the film. Michael X's involvement could have been entailed in a briefing by the 506 crew who spill out the usual generic explanations of villains and even Bern's entanglement could have been narrated through the details of the photos. While most of these moments have their entertainment value essentially they serve to drag out the film's running time.They say truth is stranger than fiction and The Bank Job definitely falls into that category. Pimps thieves spies and government officials all collide in a robbery gone right and then terribly wrong lending the inquisitive to ponder over how much or little is fabricated in this thriller. The robbery itself is merely the setup to an intricate conclusion even though the film takes time to create plenty of suspense throughout the notsocarefully planned heist. Though the people making demands continually change our attention is always seated with Jason Statham's unusually intense performance. When the credits roll and the explanation that the names have been changed to protect the guilty flashes on screen we realize what a delightfully flourished yet entertaining tale of doing the wrong thing The Bank Job really is.The Massie Twins".

When the credits roll and the explanation that the names have been changed to protect the guilty flashes on screen we realize what a delightfully flourished yet entertaining tale of doing the wrong thing The Bank Job really is.The Massie Twins";

You will literally be at the edge of your seat up to the last minute wondering if someone is either going to get killed or is someone going to get away. It is full of realistic drama action ultimatums conspiracy and lust. At times it gets kind of scary and your heart will beat faster simply from the music. It is based on true story with a few additions of its own. The movie is put together absolutely perfectly.The movie is neither too long to the point it bores you and kills the story nor too short to where you don't know the outcome. Everything in the movie is timed perfectly and is played step by step. Everything makes sense which although eliminates some surprises those surprises are hardly needed and are so obsolete that you won't even care nor realize.Overall the movie is jolly good. British actors are really much better than American ones. All the emotions seem real and at a few points you'll feel just like the characters which is great in any movie because it simply makes it more real. One more thing this movie isn't for the faint of heart there are a few scenes that are very graphic and gruesome and a few scenes that should be in a rated X movie. Of course this doesn't do anything to the movie except add even more realism too it. This is just extra knowledge for those who may feel uncomfortable or squeamish in such scenes. Otherwise this movie is a must to watch because it may very well be a classic.".

	schema:headline " Burrowing underground";
	schema:reviewBody "In this serviceable but not extraordinary film based on real events and set in 1971 London a group of amateurs pull off a bank robbery that goes wrong in a lot of interesting ways. Prompted by an exmodel former girlfriend named Martine Saffron Burrows Terry Jason Statham recruits a group of friends to tunnel into the safety deposit vault of a Lloyd's Bank on Baker Street. The alarms at this particular branch are temporarily off for adjustment of a new system just as Martine told Terry they would be. The metal drawers hold millions in jewelry and cash. Things seem pretty dicey more than once during the ambitious robbery but the crew does succeed in taking away the loot.It's not the robbery that matters though but the complications arising from the fact that in the drawers besides money and diamonds there are a lot of dirty secrets the phrase Pandora's box is even used. The madam of a fancy brothel has stashed photos of high level gents and ladies doing all sorts of naughty things at her establishment. Another box contains records of a Soho porn czar's payoffs to a corrupt police officer. And still another has scandalous snapshots belonging to the sleazy slumlord and fake black radical Michael X Peter De Jersey kept to blackmail the government. These include photos of an adulterous royal Princess Margaret and it's the need to conceal her scallywaggery that's prompted a boss at MI5 named Everett Richard Lintern who's been dating Martine to set off the whole caper calling on her because she's said she knows some villains. She must comply because he's gotten her off a drugrunning charge.The Bank Job has a retro feel unfortunately a midlevel director like Donaldson can't really compete with the best of the old heist flicks this one resembles in its more mechanical aspects. For instance a foreign expert is brought in and he gives a demonstration in a basement much like Cesar le Milanais in Jules Dassin's Rififibut the memory is devastating because this movie is nowhere near as fresh and suspenseful and atmospheric as that Fifties gem. Of course this isn't meant to be taken quite that seriouslythough it isn't meant to be farce either it's too involved in its reinvention of real events for that. There's a successful effort to make the accents and lingo authentic and the grungy images achieved by cinematographer Michael Coulter and intrusive music by various hands sort of evoke the Seventies. Unfortunately in all the complicated stuff that happens this movie forgets what it wants its tone to be. Sometimes it's light and funny sometimes it's just factual and hurried and when the cohorts get tortured by the nasties it's pretty grim.The subplots of the parliamentarians and the MI5 crooked cops and porn dealer Vogel David Suchet Terry's straight family life with two girls and wife Wendy Keeley Hawes at times seem overly complicated but the movie would collapse without them and film editor John Gilbert deserves credit for keeping things energetic and flowing by shifting scenes in ways that make this machine seem to be running on all four cylinders. The writing of Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais an experienced pair with some admirable credits can't be faulted from page to page but they're trying to weave in too much material. There's another subplot of a ham radio operator who by chance intercepts the robbers' walkietalkie communications between Terry and his rooftop lookout Eddie Michael Jibson. All things considered it's surprising all this stuff flows as well as it does. Lively English acting helps here to make the various groups of characters especially Terry's team not hard to keep track of. Jason Statham stands out with his big face short hair and perpetual threeday's growth of beard. That may not be a very Seventies look and indeed the Seventies are sometimes forgotten in the film but he has an intensity that makes his character feel stronger and more authentic than even the most able of the other cast members it's his film and that's another thing that helps save The Bank Job from becoming totally mediocre. It has a strong center.The ham radio interception gave the robbery its press name the walkietalkie bank job. The police still couldn't pinpoint which bank the voices were coming from but they broadcast tapes of them on commercial radio the next day seeking identifications. The job was done on Sunday and Monday morning of course Lloyd's employees find out which bank was robbed soon enough. Several of the robbers come to grief when captured by the crooked cop and his porn associate but four days after the robbery the government issues a a D notice forbidding any further press coverage in the interests of national security and the other fledgling thieves slip away with mutual winkwinks and a turnover of all the incriminating materials to authorities. A majority of the box holders did not report their losses end titles say so by implication they were all up to skulduggery even the money was largely dirty. Oh those naughty Seventies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had a lucky opportunity to see The Bank Job at a special evening advance preview screening somewhere in the wonderful U.S.A. and I have to write that I think it is a very interesting and energetic movie. I am a fan of Jason Statham and I think this is the best work he's done on film even better than The Transporter. Usually Statham plays a bad guy or a guy with a bad streak and this time is no exception. But I really got a sense of how determined Statham's character was to protect his family from the fallout from the legendary bank robbery. I also really like the incredible 1970s feel of the film  it was as if it had been made in the early 1970s what with the great rock music the depiction of the swinging sex scene in London the perfect costumes and just the general overall style of the movie's look. I also loved the pacing of the movie which was quick and uptempo. Things moved along really well. I also liked the movie's different plot elements and its understanding of how money can corrupt everyone even the upper crust and how a scandal must be dealt with to avoid shock to England's Royal family. The movie is fun to watch and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It's definitely wellworth seeing. I don't know what movie the person who commented about the tunneling saw but there was hardly that much tunneling  maybe a few quick scenes to establish things. They were in and out of the tunnel quickly. I never felt that the tunneling went on and on. And the pacing of the movie is so good that nothing drags or seems overdone. Statham's character reacted perfectly to everything that went on around him. This is a darn good movie with good action and excellent acting. Saffron Burrows is very good and alluring and David Suchet really played the sleazy porno king very well. I would recommend this movie to fans of Statham Burrows and Suchet to people who like caper movies to people who like looking at London and to people who enjoy the buzz that existed in the 1970s.".

So when journeyman directorforhire Roger Donaldson he of Species and Dante's Peak fame teamed up Jason Statham one of the hardest working Brits out there at the moment as much as I knew I'd watch the film my hopes weren't exactly high.

Apparently based on the true story of the 'Walkie Talkie bank robbers' Donaldson's film ticks most of the boxes you expect from a modern day British crime thriller not least the inclusion of Jason Statham who makes his fourth appearance in a genre Lock Stock Snatch Revolver that he is becoming somewhat of a mainstay oftypecast in delete as appropriate. Sweary violent and with a swerve ending its very much filmmaking by numbers here. But then again Donaldson has never been a director who stamps his originality on proceedings. This is especially clear when judging the confusing first thirty minutes of the film where you never quite sure who is who or even who is screwing who. A better director might have made this sparkly and fun but in Donaldson's hands it's just plodding and dull. However the later hour of the films running time is where it starts to come together and with the bank job well underway the film's characters story and motivations seem to gel much better. It's here the film finally lives up to it's snappy trailer It's fair to say that this is a film that belongs to its lead and even though Jason Statham is very much playing the Jason Statham we know and love that isn't such a bad thing  his charisma and charm light up the screen yet again lifting the not so great moments. It's fair to say that without him would probably have been a much duller film. As for the other cast David Sucher is the best of the rest as porn baron Lew Vogal and Craig Fairbrass turns in another one of his familiar hard as nails performances but Keeley Hawes is wasted as Terry's wife and Saffron Burrows delivers yet another performance phoned in from the comfort of her own home. Whilst never reaching the heights of films like Get Carter Snatch or a multitude of other Brit gangstercrime films that come before it there's a lot to enjoy in The Bank Job and if you can get past the first uncomfortably weak half an hour there's a good movie ready to entertain you. Just don't expect anything overly original.If you liked this try Snatch Oceans 11".

But it managed somehow to be unbelievable. And this is allegedly based on true events. The subplots are vague and uninteresting and the seventies style is not wellexplored sometimes even made irrelevant. The good cast and the main interactions between the robbers is what saves the movie in my opinion.This could have been anything from Layer Cake and Lock Stock... to The Italian Job and Revolver. However it is inferior to all of those because it is ultimately unsatisfying and tries to mix too many ingredients at once but it never gets too exciting for the viewer. There's some humour in the film which helps but at the end I was left frustrated. Another director another script... things could've been different.I'm a big fan of Jason Statham but he needs to choose his roles more carefully. This movie could have been really good but because of the pragmatic and ultimately boring way it is told somehow it turns out to be just another heist movie when it should have been the greatest of them all.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most dangerous lies are those that are based on kernels of truth. This is why I cringe whenever I see the ominous words 'based on a true story' advertising a film. The Bank Job is the fictionalized story of the walkietalkie robbery that took place in London in 1971. A small team of Cockney lads existing on the margins of criminal milieu successfully robbed the safety box vault of a posh branch of Lloyd's Bank and on the face of it got away with most of the proceeds. The film uses some of the facts the crew was indeed spotted by a ham radio operator only a handful of safety box owners made any claims and lots of gossip the rumour was that one of the safety boxes contained naughty exploits of a royal princess another implicated a crossdressing Lord Mountbatten  then adds some of its own inventions MI5 or was it MI6 staged the whole operation to recover the pictures and there was also a ledger detailing payoffs to crooked police by a porn king David Suchet unfairly looking like the late Ronnie Corbett. Jason Statham as Terry the leader of the crew does his Jason Statham act and the rest of the cast turns up to give reliable performances. The whole film works in its contrived and rushed way but it is much less than what it should have been. The look of the film tries to emulate the 1970s heist flicks but the director Roger Donaldson is not sure whether he wants to make a Boulting Brothers style heist romp or a more grungy Brit gangster film. Lighthearted scenes suddenly give way to brutal torture of likable characters farcical asides lead to serious exchanges. The look of the film although generally true to the era sometimes appears sloppy or rushed underground signs for example look distractingly modern.It is an oldfashioned script with an oldfashioned structure. The use of real names for dead characters with all the implications on their reputation and on their families is a nasty element in the film considering that it is largely based on gossip and innuendo and it sits uncomfortably with the wouldbe comedy of bumbling crooks spooks and coppers.".

This is refreshing because we have all seen too many Hollywood crime pictures that are just too comical and sciencefiction like Mission Impossible or Oceans 11. It's entertaining and would have been without its irrelevant nudity. This movie is not providing social commentary or teaching us about history it is just a fun story that is told well.

	schema:reviewBody "What truly worthwhile aspects can be taken from a film like The Bank Job? Well 'Mutton Dagger' for a start. Including that is nothing short of immature genius. Lots and lots of breasts is another. Expert alliteration using the world renowned C word is also significant. Aside from that though there isn't much leaving The Bank Job a vacuous and unpleasant experience. Anybody expecting another Lock Stock or Snatch as the marketing suggests will be severely disappointed. Sure director Roger Donaldson attempts to weave an intricate tapestry of lies double crosses witty dialogue and interrelated characters who all conveniently find themselves present at the less than satisfying climax but he utterly fails. So many poorly executed subplots and underdeveloped characters are crammed into the running time that there isn't actually any room for anything else. Like interest. Or continuity. Or drama.The tepid story is based on an actual 1970s bank robbery which took place in London by a team of small time criminals. Amongst the safety deposit boxes in the bank's vault are a number of photographs depicting a member of the royal family in various promiscuous positions and a ledger containing the names of all the corrupt police officers in the city. Various interest groups do not want these items to fall in the wrong hands and so with little imagination try to retrieve them from the group of robbers. That's it. That's the whole story. It's VERY difficult to guess the outcome like whether the cheeky criminals lead by wide boy Jason Statham will get away with it and live happily ever after or if the compromising ledger will fall into the hands of the only honest policeman in Scotland Yard but I believe anybody not in a persistent vegetative state could probably work it out. A little more problematic though is how everything actually all works out. The screenwriters noticed this during filming and helpfully included a couple of lines of dialogue in order to resolve any ambiguity which to paraphrase went like this Bank robber How did we get away with not getting arrested by the police for stealing millions of pounds when they CLEARLY knew it was us even if we did give them the ledger? Jason Statham I don't know. Excellent. No perplexity here. There is also a side story involving Black civil rights revolutionary Michael X NOT Malcolm which seems like it was shoehorned into the film during post production when somebody suddenly realised that the entire cast was white. It is difficult to recall anything about the cast which consists mostly of cardboard cutouts with voiceovers. There were policemen whom you could tell were policemen because they arrived in twos stood with their hands in the pockets of their flowing black coats and spoke as though they were doing somebody a favour every time they opened their mouths. The antagonists were easy to discern because they looked menacing and used four word sentences which were almost always dripping with malicestupidity. Finally the good guys were the ones standing around Jason Statham whenever he was in a scene unless it was a scene in which he was being menaced by the bad guys. It took really solid acting all round to convey this. It would have been mightily confusing otherwise.See this film either if you don't like money and like to rid yourself of it in the most boring ways you can think of or if you find it amusing to observe Jason Statham struggling through yet another miscast role JS Do I need to look angry or confused here? Director Well she's your daughter and you're giving her a present. JS So...angry then? D No I'm kind of looking for loving and happy. JS pulling a face You mean like this? D Well...that's more like confusion don't you think? JS I...can't tell.".

Watching little Elijah Wood with his bow tie reminded me of myself at that age.Mr. Levinson through film and Randy Newman through his haunting musical score did a magnificent job of recreating a world that has all but disappeared. A time when family was the center of our lives children respected the adults and were expected to behave in a civilized manner people didn't spend Sundays running all over town to football soccer games etc and the elder members of the family were revered instead of ignored or worse placed in a home.We those of us in the postwar generation would to well to look at this film as a guideline for how to bring values back into our lives and realize that we all need to rethink our priorities.If you want to relive your childhood for 2 12 hours laugh one minute and cry the next I HIGHLY recommend this film".

It is a truly brilliant film written and directed by Barry Levinson.It is about the evolution of the storyteller. Sam the head of the family comes to America in 1914 on the Fourth of July. It was a time when family meant something and those that came here first sent money back so that other family members could join them in the land of hope.  Sam is the the family storyteller.  He tells the family history to the children in hopes that they will always remember where they came from.  As the years go by the family moves away from Avalon the neighborhood that they first came to and the family begins to change.  They move apart and splinter and the new technology known as the television becomes the storyteller.  Thanksgivings which are the unifying holiday throughout the story begin with the family waiting for all of the brothers to arrive before they cut the turkey and proceeds through smaller family groups sitting at TV stands watching television and ends finally when grandson Michael with his son visits Sam in a nursing home where the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade plays silently on the televison in Sam's room.As the film concludes Michael who is the embodiment of Barry Levinson in the tradition of the storyteller shares his grandfather's story with his son.All of this backed by Randy Newman's haunting score one of the most fitting ever written for a film.This is a must see.".

Opening with a magnificently shot flashback of MuellerStahl's arrival in America on July 4th some forty years earlier the film develops a nostalgic yet never overtly sentimental approach to its subject matter and always keeps its storyline rooted firmly in reality.Although the film has no specific plot or central character the magnificent MuellerStahr emerges as the principal paternal figure trying to keep his increasingly disparate family of brothers children nephews nieces and sundry together amidst the turning tides of cultural change. Joan Plowright plays his stubborn wife who has never learned to fully adapt to the lifestyles in the West while his son Aidan Quinn is trying desperately to cash in on the American dream that brought his father to those shores in the first place. A tale told with great colour character and humour and populated with a huge assortment of human characters and memorable moments 'Avalon' is a beautifully composed piece of American cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Avalon is really a beautifully written story and Levinson's cast is excellent. This really is one of the better stories of the American experience. Actually I'd have to say it's the BEST story of the American experience ever brought to film. I say that knowing that it really is the urban JewishAmerican experience and not one that is necessarily shared by other groups. I dont care for rigid definitions of the American experience because it can be a vastly differing one. Having said that though I must still say that Avalon is a wonderful chronicling of an American immigrant family originaly from Eastern Europe who put down roots in the Avalon section of Baltimore. It is refreshing in that New York City is generally credited for this kind of narrative. So much so that it's easy to forget that ethnic communities sprang up in Philadelphia Baltimore Boston Chicago San Francisco etc. Not just NYC. Through the narration of Sam Krichinsky we see his children and grandchildren grow up and he grow old. We are with him when his wife Joan Plowrightpasses away When his son's business is destroyed by fire when he argues with his oldest Brother and a great rift divides the Krichinskys forever. we hear his stories of this and that and always he returns to the 4th of July 1914 when he arrived in Baltimore for the first time. Levinson is fantastic as he films what is obviously an idealized representation seen only in Sam Krichinsky's rose colored memory of the event. There is so much poignance sorrow and love in Avalon and small details become deeply profound moments in the life of an elderly man struggling to remember the good times while the world moves on. The closing scene in which Sam's Grandson now a father himself with whom he has always had a close relationship visits him in a nursing home. We know from Sam's state that the end cannot be far. Its a brief scene with little dialogue but it is AWESOME!!!! in the sublime way it conveys it's message. I choke up just thinking about that scene. See Avalon!!!".

You'll laugh you'll cry you'll even be nice to that cousin you can't stand or your daughter's current boyfriendwho you swear is from Pluto!  Most exceedingly highly recommended!!!";

On screen Avalon is unconscionably sloppy the leaves of deciduous trees in Baltimore at Christmas are green on one block yellow on another and nonexistent on a third structurally amorphous the movie could end at any time or go on forever which it seems to do and gummily sentimental grandparents and children are psychologically saintly. The lovely moments and fine performances in the picture can't redeem Levinson's technical carelessness  the editing is without rhythm momentum or even logic  nor can they compensate for Avalon's ethnographic toothlessness imagine Mordecai Richler without the bite.Levinson would have made Duddy Kravitz a mensch.Avalon is more irritating than most ambitious failures because Levinson winner of the best directing Oscar in 1988 for Rain Man is wildly talented and his two earlier semiautobiographical films set in Baltimore Diner and Tin Men were twin peaks of Proustian purity. Structured lightly but soundly in the esthetic version of aluminum they vaulted over the twin valleys of bathos sentimentality and nostalgia.Avalon is a bridge made of lead.But students of performance will want to see it for a quartet of reasons. The first is Armin MuellerStahl the East German actor who came West in the late seventies and has not been within spitting distance of mediocrity since whether as the tortured politician in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Lola the complex farmer in Angry Harvest or Jessica Lange's mysterious father in Music Box. As written Avalon's Sam Krichinsky is fundamentally a grandchild's adoring projection of a grandfather but MuellerStahl's Prussian blue eyes bespeak more depth than the character is permitted to articulate when the script does become bluntly pedantic MuellerStahl subtly softens the blows. Sadly even this great actor is done in at the end when he is plastered with outrageously inept oldage makeup. He looks like nothing less than a blueeyed Teutonic E.T. about to sing a geriatric variation of Cabaret's Nazi hymn Tomorrow Belongs to Me Yesterday Vas Mine.The second extraordinary actor is Joan Plowright the British widow of Laurence Olivier she plays Eva Krichinsky Sam's PolishAmerican wife with a flawless accent as if she had not done Shakespeare Chekhov John Osborne or Peter Greenaway all of whom she has of course enlivened. But technique aside she follows MuellerStahl in toughening up the soft edges and in softening the rough edges of a character verging on caricature while certainly Jewish her meddling mothercumgrandmother is no stage bound Jewish mother.The most fully dramatized conflict in Avalon involves the grandparents and their relationship to their son Jules and his wife Ann and eventually to the young couple's children all of whom live together. Aidan Quinn as the cautious and contemplative Jules and Elizabeth Perkins as the funloving but responsible Ann complete the foursome of exceptional performances he infuses an introvert with exterior life and she captures the spirit of femininity in the fifties with eerie exactitude as if Life had come to life it's an asset that she looks like the Judy Garland of that period.Four fabulous musicians less than fabulous music for them to play the resonant sequences an ongoing Thanksgiving argument for example are regularly intercut with comic schtick the most egregious instance being the purchase of a television set  would people interested enough in TV to buy one not know that during the day there were no programs? The purchasers sit in front of the box watch the test pattern get disgusted and leave it to the kids. It's a funny bit but it's fraudulent and it corrodes Avalon which is trying to do something new with the stuff of dejavu. There are two lines delivered by Eva that express the irritation Avalon engenders How many times do we have to hear this story? We all heard it before. Benjamin MIller Filmbay Editor".

	schema:reviewBody "How can I explain how much I loved this movie? I can't. I just can't. I love it so so much I can't explain it. I came across this movie by somewhat of an accident last year sometime. I did a Netflix search for The Mists of Avalon. No Mists of Avalon but instead an Aiden Quinn movie called simply Avalon. I pushed it aside and didn't give it a second thought. 5 months or so ago I was just browsing the same sight once again Avalon popped up. I watched the trailer thought it looked good and put it on my queue list. It sat forever and ever so I deleted it. Once again never giving it a second thought.Then 2 months ago I became very interested in the actor Tom Wood Noah Newman from The Fugitive and U.S. Marshals and the adult Michael from this film. I of course went to Netflix and did a search for him. Avalon however did not show up on the list. I returned my attention to a list I had written with all of the movies he's made listed. I typed Avalon in the search box and sure enough it was the same Avalon. I immediately put it in the queue and bumped it up to the top spot. A day or so later we received Avalon in the mail and I waisted no time in watching it. I was immediately in love with the characters and the way the family bonded together. My family is a lot like that OK we're not immigrants oh somewhere down the line I'm sure we are but that's not the point we're not Jewish we're in fact Missionary Baptists and we don't live in a clump ok most of us do but a few cousins and me and my parents live apart from the clump.. We have those conversations at the dinner table we have those conversations at Thanksgiving and Christmas and things like that.I was so touched by the simplicity but emotional impact of the simple line I came to America in 1914..... I couldn't help but burst into tears.SPOILERS My favorite scene had to be the scene where they had the family circle meeting at Gabriel's house and Eva kept saying it was like a furnace in here! And then without warning An elephant just walked by the window. So funny the first time you see it.And of course I had to love the last scene when Michael and his son Sam went to see Grandpa Sam. I was especially touched by this scene because that is the same shape my grandfather got into shortly before he passed away last year. I did cry and remembered all the times my parents dragged me to the nursing homes and hospitals to see him and I began to miss him again.So I guess the reason I loved this movie so much is because after seeing it the first time Sam sort of brought my Grandpa back to me for a little while. The way he acted the way he would take control of a situation the way he told stories....Thank you Barry Levinson for that even if no one else cares. You did a good thing for me. The final moments of the film made me think of what I'd tell my kids when I'm older....Michael and Little Sam walking out of the nursing home and Michael beginning Sam's story and passing it down....He came to America in 1914......Definitely watch this movie. Don't let it pass you by. It's amazing. Take my word for it.".

There really isn't any flow that ramps up to a climax. It's just a series of interesting family vignettes coming one after the other. It goes on too long.This is essentially Levinson's home movie reshot onto the big screen. As such it is the best home movie in anybody's dusty attics. But like all those home movies it probably means more for people who remember those times than those of us who were never there.".

It's a far richer film than the first two chapters of his Baltimore trilogy with a screenplay spanning three generations and most of the 20th century but the dramatic scope comes at the expense of detail and Levinson's explanation for the postwar decline of the American family is thus never able to reach beyond the most obvious culprits television and suburban malaise.

College freshmen on the whole seem to really enjoy this film and papers that I ask them to write on it have been thoughtful and provocative.The story is multigenerational and centers on an immigrant arriving in Baltimore MD in the early 1900s. It then traces his life forward through the generations all the while noting how the impact of being in a new country changes him and his descendants. The cast does a fine job Levinson's direction is superb but pay attention to subtle nuances!

What I didn't expect is the movie's journey to hyperrealism. When a film starts out like it's going to be in the same vein as say A Christmas Story I didn't expect it to end up like a documentary on the indignities of old age. Imagine every report on senility and its toll on everyone and you get an idea of the end. It isn't this movie's fault that the trailers portrayed it as one thing and it was something else. It isn't the movie's fault that I just wasn't in the mood to see what's happening in real life in homes all over this country. If the movie does have a fault it's that the directorwriter actors and set designers etc. were so good at setting the tone for a gentle trip down memory lane it was just so jarring when realism intruded at the end. I think the same thing could have been accomplished by stopping at the hypnotized by TV holiday dinnerwith a lot less scenes of heartbreaking decline. I know that wasn't what the filmmaker wanted to do but it would have been a film I would have enjoyed seeing more. We should be depressed by what this story says about us I just wasn't expecting a lesson on the topic when I taped this film. That's my fault but so many people use the terms feelgood and nostalgic to describe this film and I didn't feel good after watching and I consider nostalgia to be something that leaves you with a happy positive feeling about the past. For all this film's fine acting and great set design it did not leave me with anything but regretsmaybe that was the point.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are several reasons I treasure this film. What lingers for me because I play the piano is Randy Newman's sentimental and delicate score. I noticed in a recent viewing that the editing placed the score in the background which added subtle texture whereas in the Pixar films he's done the soundtracks are more aggressively in your face ears so to speak. The haunting themes in Avalon I consider to be some of master Randy's finest with only Awakenings topping the list.I had not realized how much of a family film this was with no violence or vulgarity anywhere and frankly we don't miss it. The film is filled with nuances of ethnic inflections that capture the mannerisms in which people of that era communicated with each other. Sometimes the body language alone even was more hilarious and important than the actual dialogue.Having grown up in an environment not too far removed from the immigrant Polish Jewish one portrayed I recognized many family dramas that were so familiar I could pick them out one by one. It is not that families don't eat at table and talk and squabble anymore. It is often the starting point in which they bring their heated conversations to a boil that has changed over the generations. Consider for example the focus on pooling family finances either as a yearly tithe towards favoured charities or the same channelling of resources to sponsor or subsidize the arrival of another relative stuck in Europe. Families today rarely have cause to consider their lives within this framework.The film is honest charming funny sad and warm by turns nostalgic and also quite descriptive of how European immigrants worked from nothing into sometimes very successful living conditions and levels of wealth and affluence. The generation of immigrants not just Jewish that fled the turmoils of Europe almost without exception came with very meagre resources. Pushing their children and encouraging their grandchildren to work hard keep focused and to excel the standards that they lived helped propel the higher levels of success and affluence. All of that drama is given a proper map in this film.There are some very funny scenes in this film none more touching than the famous turkey scene in which Lou Jacobi's character and his wife typically arrive late for a Thanksgiving Dinner having travelled by car quite a distance only to find that his younger brother has just cut the turkey. Outraged by this insult to his pride screaming at his brother that he cut the toikee accents included and making a family fuss of huge over reaction makes for very funny but recognizable stresses that many families I'm sure faced.Another thing that caught my attention is that Levinson almost completely bleached out the reality that these were Polish Jews. You can find maybe one line where someone responds to a sentence with Yiddish phrase but it is spoken so quickly that unless you are aware of it you'll miss it entirely. No one is depicted going to synagogue or consulting a Rabbi. I find that a bit odd considering that even if coming to Baltimore in 1914 the Jews were at that point more obviously Jewish many men still wearing traditional head coverings. The only obvious sign of this being Jewish people are the exaggerated Jewish accents.Watch for very young Elijah Woods who is quite good for a little kid. The real stars give an understated performance allowing the richness of the story to speak for itself. I love this film and could recommend it to those who need an uplifting family based drama. Excellent.".

The first is heavily based on MangaAnimee style in visual dynamics much more than in pace as well as storytelling the latter IS an Animee movie without the animations  in fact Avalon is a VERY typical Oshii film in every other aspect going.It's slow. It has to be. It either bores you stiff or chains you to a subtle incredibly intense way of visual storytelling  takes you back to a time when the attention span as well as the will required to catch a drift  to hold a thought and work on it  lived longer than a few seconds.On the surface this movie is what one could call a cyberpunk poem. For that alone it already claims a unique position amongst whatever one might want to compare it to at first glance. A chillingly dark and detailed as well as beautifully crafted ballad of a heroine seeking much more than sense between realities and illusions. She seeks the home we all desperately try to cling to in belief for lack of knowledge.As always in Oshii's movies one has to be prepared to be drawn into the unsettling realm between suffocating rules of conduct and complete uncertainty to get at the tiny grain of hope hovering so painfully close to the wheels that try to grind you.The dialogue doesn't tell us much. In fact the more wordy the explanations get the more they deflect us from what we see and feel. That's pretty much what Ash has to cope with as well to find the way to HER reality as well as illusion.To call the acting understated slow and painfully introverted would be an understatement in itself. To call it bad for that would be the most idiotic conclusion. Malgorzata Foremniak Ash is a true discovery. The intensity and sheer impact she can give to 'silence' alone makes her the ideal Oshii actress. There is no empty move no hollow gesture no shallow expression in her entire performance. Quite an accomplishment if one keeps in mind that Ash leads a depressingly empty hollow as well as shallow life on the surface.It's an equally depressing fact that this incredible Polish actress will stay in obscurity as far as the billion dollar mainstream movie world is concerned.The cinematography and lighting by Grzegorz Kedzierski is nothing short of exquisite. So is Barbara Novak's production design. Budgetwise this is a BMovie but they all turned that restriction into a virtue.One last praise has to go to the composer as well as the musicians. The title track 'Avalon' alone a grand piece for orchestra choir and soprano is nothing short of a masterpiece.As I said this movie is a poem. Take a quiet place wind down from the hassle of your day and let yourself sink into illusions which might even show the occasional glint of YOUR reality. 10 out of 10Schogger13".

	schema:reviewBody " DirectorOshii Mamuro. Known for his slow pace attention to detail quite complicated storylines and his moodsetting. Always works together with Kenji Kawai sound and Ito story. Other movies include Ghost In The Shell Patlabor 12OAVMinipato Urutsei YatsuraBeautiful Dreamer. Also contributed to JinRoh and Blood. All these are worth a peek especially if you like Avalon. Strange little fact  Oshii's a total dog freak. Watch his movies carefully. StoryWell I can be short here. Set in an alternative presentfuture a girl Ash sets out to find a hidden level in a VRgame Avalon. It may be a bit thin but a good setup for the main theme of the movie. Besides that Oshii's movies were never all that storybased to begin with as he pays a lot more attention to general moodsetting of his alternate realities. Oh and for those who claim it's too confusing try to focus a bit. After two viewings most of it can be understood minus a few little details. One warning though. The pace is as slow as ever. Oshii is one to leave you a lot of time to think about certain things that happen. Some like this most of you probably won't. ActingKinda hard to judge as the movie was made in Poland with Polish actors. Personally I find the acting adequate. No oscar nominations here but good work from the leading actress and the guy that plays Murphy. It all depends on what you like. To me the charm came from the exotic language some will probably find this a turnoff. The conversation is minimal and not so important. It's just there to deliver the facts not to explain emotions. Comments about the coldness of Ash have nothing to do with bad acting but with the character she plays another one of Oshii's trademarks. CharactersTypical Oshii. A cold female in the leading role. The only time she shows emotion is when she's in the vicinity of her dog  dogs in general. Besides that she's an ice cube. Personally I like 'em like that. The others are interesting because of their little quirks and oddities not because of their background stories emotional struggles or deeper motives. All in all they're a memorable bunch but only there because you can't make a movie without characters. ThemesEvery Oshii movie has it's own theme. Beautiful Dreamer was about the boundary between dream and reality Patlabor 1 about the relationship between mankind and machinery and Patlabor 2 about war in general. Avalon tries to question the boundary between reality and virtual reality using the firstperson game genre as an ideal setup. Which world is real which isn't does it actually matter and is there a way to find out what's real and what isn't. Oshii poses all these questions but doesn't deliver any answers. Which in my humble opinion is the best way to handle it. When a movie does try to give you an answer Existenz it doesn't stimulate the viewer to think about it afterwards. So it all depends on what you're looking for. You want some questions to think about this is your movie you want a quick story with cheesy moral Existenz again avoid. Special effectsAgain the opinions here are diverse. I think it's one of the most visually impressive movies I've ever seen. Everything looks absolutely gorgeous especially when you compare the original shots with the result. But allow me to stretch the term SFX a bit. This isn't The Matrix with twirly flashy inyourface SFX. Instead the first hour or so is completely reworked with a superb sepiacolored filter which gives the movie a 1940 postcard kinda look. Besides that the SFX are a lot more subtle. Those which are inyourface like the rendered vehicles are done nicely. I especially liked the Citadel and although the rendering is not perfect the designs are marvelous. MusicOshii regular Kenji Kawai made all the songs for this film. Oshii's one of the last to realize the effect a good soundtrack has on a movie. And I don't mean finding some pop idols and putting them on a CD but really incorporating the songs in your movie for extra effect and even working the other way around by adjusting the images to the sound. All the songs were written for Avalon and vary from ambient to something close to opera. Even if you don't like the movie or haven't seen it yet the soundtrack should be part of your CDMP3 collection. General MoodsettingWell this is what makes the movie one of the best there is. It requires a special kind of taste to like it though. The characters' reality is a bleak and cold one with little room for emotions yet portrayed in such a way that it still feels kind of warm and cosy. It's hard to explain but I believe it's best compared with the darker side of romance. The feeling you get when you're sitting in front of your window it's raining outside and your girlfriend just left you. It's a sort of gentle comforting sadness. He atteigns this through the music the sepia filter slow pace and briliant camera swoopspositions. One of the fears I had before I saw the movie was that he wouldn't be able to capture this mood in a live action he normally makes animated movies which all have a certain style of their own to begin with but he did a magnificent job. Very unique and stylish. OverallI would like to say this movie has no similarities with The Matrix or Existenz whatsoever. People who expect a movie like the afore mentioned will be disappointed. This is 100 Oshii. It's a bit difficult to recommend to people who don't know him and his way of working. My advise is try to watch Ghost In The Shell first. It has an easier job holding your attention if you like animation that is but is still representative for his other work. Personally I think this ranks among the five best movies ever. It's refreshing it's unique and made with passion. Hollywood fans beware others try it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Avalon is a beautiful movie but not for everyone. If you mainly like action or fastpaced movies you may be turned off by some of the slow scenes during the movie. Avalon has action though and explosions galore. Some of the story is a little ridiculous and hard to follow but that isn't necessarily a bad thing at all.This is the only film I know of that was a coproduction of both Japan and Poland. Directed by Mamoru Oshii but filmed mostly in Poland and in the native Polish language. While watching this movie you get a feeling of a very unique quality. It was filmed or altered in post to resemble an old Sepia toned film but still with the highresolution of today's film standard. This adds a very bleak and depressive visual style to much of the movie. That's a good thing because this is not a happy movie in the least.Avalon relies heavily on CGI throughout the movie due to the cyber game world that the movie is largely dealing with. Much of the CGI effects are quite interesting to watch. You can often tell they are CGI effects but it's obvious that it's a computer dominating world with players inside it.Another effective element to the film was the excellent music score by Kenji Kawai. This has to be one of the most beautiful and engaging film scores I've heard in a long time. It ranges through many different forms even to the operatic. Very layered and complex yet easy on the ears. Recorded with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra tons of people played the various musical instruments in the recording of the score according to the end credits. I would compare it in a sense to Christopher Young's otherworldly and haunting score for the first two Hellraiser films. It's a shame that the soundtrack to Avalon is currently only available as an expensive import CD.Even if you dislike the film you must watch it once just for the amazing music...it really is that good.".

None of the characters of this world are privy to the visual poetry we are being exposed to as viewers... and that is part of the point they are blind to it... yet it's a reminder that technological obsessiveness or material obsessiveness blinds everyone from simple visual beauty.

Watch at the very end of the movie how the ghost's mouth wavers almost like the Mona Lisa from sad halffrown into a smirk and this was done in post. I'm sure many people missed very subtle and beautiful touches like this on first viewing. If someone were to critique it for lack of complexity I would agree... Blade Runner was not deep in the same way... but both upon multiple viewings remain almost timelessly poignant while being very reflective of when they were made and I'm sure in 10 years this movie will seem as striking as Blade Runner is to me now over 20 years since it's release. This will be one to watch over and over again every 6 months.One caveat... the Miramax version is rubbish. The translations are horrible and stupid. Literally you lose half the meaning of the film. At one point Ashe is talking to the Gamemaster discussing Avalon the mythic island and discussing Odin and the helmet of forgetting... right as she puts the VR helmet on.

	schema:headline " Beautifully filmed and captivating";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a stunningly visual film which takes many of the best elements of the minor subgenre of 1980s and 1990s scifi involving virtual reality and blends them into an interesting story exploring social withdrawal addiction the nature of reality and the value of life. The film does have a bit of new wave pretentiousness to it  using clich hackernames for the players of Avalon etc but no more so than many of its competitors and a bit less than The Matrix. If this sort of thing doesn't appeal to you  and especially if you're the type who wants a film to simply entertain and tell you a simple story don't bother to read any further.The film uses a storytelling technique common in good literature but unfortunately underused in film  that of intentional ambiguity. The best example of this is the main character  well played by Malgorzata Foremniak. You simply don't know what to make of Ash. Though I found it easy to relate to this character and I think I understand her I am not sure most viewers will. In my opinion Ash is best interpreted as a person with an ironclad grip on reality who nevertheless maintains a distance from the people around her and prefers to keep her relationships ingame. This is not at all an uncommon personality type especially among women and mature males in the real worlds of virtual reality and online gaming.The film focuses on Ash's ambitions to become the best player of Avalon  an ultrareal and sometimes deadly virtual reality game  in the world. Avalon is illegal and run on LANs which are set up in what looks like futuristic crack houses. To become recognized as the best Ash has to complete a level which tends to put anybody who enters it into a catatonic state. She comes to believe that an old team mate of hers  Murphy  inhabits that zone and wants to rescue him. But of course the designers of the game have other plans and maybe Murphy himself does as well. Foremniak does a great job of playing this ambiguous yet sympathetic character. Ash the carefully developed script the excellent soundtrack and the superb and beautiful visual effects all keep you guessing until the very end. I never knew what to expect from this film and I was very pleased by the way it developed its own concepts of logic and justice  remaining centered on Ash throughout.Avalon was interesting enough for a second and perhaps a third viewing. I will update my review if needed after my next round with it. For now I will only give it a very high recommendation to anybody who has read this far. After all if you've read this far in the review you're probably interested enough in the film to see it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a stunningly visual film which takes many of the best elements of the minor subgenre of 1980s and 1990s scifi involving virtual reality and blends them into an interesting story exploring social withdrawal addiction the nature of reality and the value of life. The film does have a bit of new wave pretentiousness to it  using clich hackernames for the players of Avalon etc but no more so than many of its competitors and a bit less than The Matrix. If this sort of thing doesn't appeal to you  and especially if you're the type who wants a film to simply entertain and tell you a simple story don't bother to read any further.The film uses a storytelling technique common in good literature but unfortunately underused in film  that of intentional ambiguity. The best example of this is the main character  well played by Malgorzata Foremniak. You simply don't know what to make of Ash. Though I found it easy to relate to this character and I think I understand her I am not sure most viewers will.

	schema:headline " Strengths  weaknesses of a pretty good film";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a lot to recommend this movie including a richlystylized world exciting action and excellent music. I will admit that I was first interested in this movie because I knew of the director Mamoru Oshii from the anime Ghost in the Shell so I wasn't surprised to find that the movie felt much like a very stylized highquality anime movie. Indeed I wasn't surprised that the Japanese director revealed in an interview included with the DVD I watched that his relationship with the Polish actress playing the main character Ash was much like his relationship with a character from one of his anime projects since he could no more communicate personally with Malgorzata Foremniak than he could with one of his anime characters. To him the actress was entirely her character and it's intriguing to see what became of that very unusual relationship on film.I'm always wary of getting carried away with a first reaction to a film so I should admit that this film isn't perfect. I found myself wanting to know more about the background of the main character and her family and how she came to become the person we see in the film certainly Malgorzata Foremniak does a very good job of playing a character whose fantasy life the life of her online RPG character is more real than her 'real' life but the lack of background detail makes her character Ash very much like a twodimensional anime character and that can be considered a weakness. Also this movie bears an obvious similarity to The Matrix which predated it so most viewers will inevitably compare this movie to The Matrix and find it perhaps wanting in that it doesn't lay out the background of the virtual world of the Avalon RPG as clearly as The Matrix lays out the background of its world.These factors notwithstanding I still enjoyed Avalon and I recommend it to anyone with more than a passing interest in virtual reality stories anime or highlystylized science fiction in general. In the aforementioned interview the director mentions that his films tend to deal with a borderline between fantasy and reality and it's quite apparent that Ash's 'real world' is somehow both grittier and less real than the world of the Avalon RPG which she's so obsessed with. The action sequences in the film featuring realworld equipment from the Polish army such as tanks and attack helicopters are exciting in their own right but the special effects of the film such as explosions reduced to 2D images and bystanders who disintegrate when shot make it clear what is supposedly real and what is supposedly virtual. Also the contrast between fantasy and reality is much more vivid here than in the Matrix movies  and that's especially apparent toward the end of the movie where the viewer is left to wonder just what if anything is ultimately real and what is simply imagined. Also I must say that the music of this film is extraordinary including choral music that is downright eerie but also beautiful at the same time. A world both real and unreal is conjured very effectively in this movie and therefore I would recommend it to any fans of this subgenre of science fiction in particular and fans of highlystylized filmmaking in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "Avalon can be seen as part of a trilogy the first installment of which would be Ghost in the Shell the last Ghost in the Shell Innocence. Avalon contains many direct references to Ghost in the Shell and shares a lot of its motif of philosophical search for the self. They also share the cyberpunk imagery and the fact that the main heroine is an impassive female warrior. I mention all this because I think it's inadvisable to watch Avalon if you haven't watched Ghost in the Shell and pondered on it a bit. Avalon can be extremely heavy at times. This movie does not make you think watching Avalon is like trying to decipher a zen poem which I think can be done but not through intellectual decoding.In Avalon a lone hunter in a virtual reality game shares her life with a basset dog and all her activities seem to be centered around getting better in the illegal dangerous game and getting food the dog with the money she earns there. The game is illegal because you can die playing it really die in the concrete bleak urban world that Ash the main hero lives every day. However apart from the possibility of virtual death the game offers a secret  the highest level Avalon. The legendary Avalon is the Isle of the Blessed where King Arthur lies in eternal sleep. In the movie it is a mystery which haunts Ash ever since the deaths of her last player team.The search for Avalon is depicted in the most beautiful cinematography. The plot is very symbolic and should be considered so the search for the gate to Avalon can mean many things and the nature of the quest changes as Ash is getting closer. However like Ghost in the Shell Innocence the movie is heavy and long and the characters engage in philosophical discussion every time they can. With all its beautiful cinematography interesting acting very automatonlike but intentionally so and a set of intriguing philosophical questions this movie suffers from heavyhanded imagery and symbols sometimes. Hard science fiction pushes the science as far as possible Avalon is an example of hard cyberpunk where the confines of the conceptual world dreamed up by the director are explored fully and unremittingly.If you are ready to take a film not as only entertainment but also a challenge to your thinking power Avalon like all Oshii's movies is a thrill. However beautiful intellectually rewarding science fiction does not have to be longish and heavy as Avalon is at times. Watch Ghost in the Shell before it watch Ghost in the Shell Innocence after it and approach this movie at your most relaxed for it to be a rewarding rewarding experience it can wear you down otherwise.One more thing if you're Polish watch the Japanese dub with English subtitles. The Polish lines were translated literally from the Japanese and they are very often almost gibberish and the Japanese voiceacting is better too. Also do not let the fact that the movie's virtual world seems to be set in your local Kmart detract from your watching experience.".

The artwork is stunning the soundtrack very strong and classical instead of the usual techno the acting is cool and distant which is all perfect for the dark setting. Even the choice of Poland as the scenery seems right on.Why then doesn't this flic deserve a 10? Well although I liked the story and though it does have depth it is a bit onedimensional.

I stumbled onto this film late one night at the local video rental and it was like my last option so I had little or no expectations to be deflated. I was pleasantly surprised. The sombre ambiance of the surroundings Poland enchanted me and the sepia black  white film stock simply added to the mystique of the setting. Indeed I have not experienced such a rich atmosphere in a scifi film since Blade Runner!!! The SLIGHTLY lowtech special effects were incredible in that they seemed to add authenticity to the fact that this was a video game NOT reality unlike a lot of scifi where the special effects are merely another prop. The insular existence of the lead character due to her obsession with her virtual world is perhaps very poignant today more than ever with the advent of cyber space computer games etc and their potential for social alienation. Perhaps the films shortcoming is that it may not appeal to the younger set who have grown up on a heavy diet of Hollywood Blockbusters where there has to be the mandatory car chase and subsequent sex followed by a gratuitous helping of ultra violence but for me that was part of this very artistic films charm.".

Tremendous thought went into the coloring of scenes  shading lighting and angles. Absolutely breathtaking! From heartpounding moments of shock to quiet corners of solitude this movie carries your soul to the furthest reaches of human experience. The sound track is marvelous stunning thrilling. The choral and orchestral contributions are refined and balanced easily lifting you to climaxes expression then drawing you to glide to imperceptible moments of lull. A work of art that will send shivers down your spine warm your heart and fill your mind with deep thoughts. I will continue to watch this movie over and over again for the rest of my life. Way ahead of it's time. It is so unusual to find such a perfect combination of plot special effects orchestral arrangement acting and inspirational settings. The depth of theory that underlies this philosophical tome of cinematography filled my soul with wonderment throughout each moment of this triumphant film. This movie is destined to be a classic in the annals of movie making! If there was a god he has undoubtedly gently drawn breath through the artists who collaborated on this project. A masterwork of untouchable excellence!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most captivating SF movies I've seen in ages.PLEASE do not rent it if you expect to see another Matrix or Die Hard 298. This is not a slambamblowthemup thrillride which I also like but a slow visually stunning exploration of the human mind and soul. Oshii uses the camera like an artist uses hisher brush and canvas this movie is a painting clear and simple a decadent orgy of colors and music of shadows and lights of reality and surreality fused into a single dream. It is also VERY heavy occasionally even preachy which is something you might already be used to if you have seen Ghost in the Shell and similar FarEastern films and multilayered with symbols and allusions and metaphors. No matter how many times you watch it you are always finding new meanings and messages unfolding like petals of a flower.The special fx are excellent although many of them are designed to retain their 'artificial' flavour which is essential to the understanding of the film's message. In fact in many places the REAL images of the REAL world are intentionally made to look like handpainted cells from a Japanese anime and at times you literally cannot decide if what you are watching is animation or film  which is no small feat especially when you realize that with the exception of some 3D work the original 'rough' shots are made with as traditional a technology as possible.What is the movie about? Well there are multiple interpretations. It may be about whether we live in reality or not whether we underappreciate our 'ordinary' life in a reality that others would consider heaven whether in the modern world it is still possible to be a hero or are we forced to escape into cyberspace if we want to be heros ourselves whether life is a game and if it is can we win it  and should we keep playing it even if we know we cannot win in the end whether we can control our fate and whether control means willfully choosing a slavery of real life or accepting a virtual slavery that we can control etc. The movie plays with the same concepts that surface in Ghost in the Shell of course and Blade Runner and Kaffka and Matrix and Gattaca and Brazil and The Twelve Monkies and Dark City and Solaris and Stalker and manymany other films but it is much better and more tightly integrated than any of the others. In fact there are many indications e.g. the 'Ghost' of the little girl the design of the tanks the figure of the Bishop that it may be a 'prequel' to Ghost in the Shell. At the minimum there is definitely a tight intellectual connection between the two.WARNING! Avalon does have some 'traditional' action scenes in it and they are executed with style and gusto but it also slows down a couple of times and has about 7 minutes overall that could have been trimmed without losing its character.ALSO the DVD I watched Miramax NTSC release is set to the Polish language by default so you have to actually go to Setup and switch to English it has both an English language track AND optional subtitles before you start playing if you want to watch it in English.A mustsee for everybody who appreciates fine cinema.".

'What is Reality?' and 'Is there purpose to life?' and 'Is there more than what I am seeing?' are common questions that are acknowledged in art.The subject of virtual reality and the nature of reality is not new read William Gibson's 'Neuromancer' but Mamoru Oshii manages to do something that is rarely done in cinema or at least rarely done well. That is make you feel something that is intangible and beyond words. Ghost in the Shell did this for me as well as such monumental films as 2001. This film is in that class I believe.The only suggestions I have to those that are interested in watching Avalon is don't believe Miramax who botched the American DVD and their hype about comparing this film to The Matrix. They want to sell it to Matrix fans. They think it is a hard sell. But other than the virtual reality aspect there is not much that these two films have in common. Also watch the film with subtitles if you have the Miramax version. The dub leaves a lot to be desired and hearing the film in Polish gives the film a different feel and complements the imagery.People interested in ideas and art will enjoy this film. It is not an 'action' film.".

But anyway I can't really find anything to defend Avalon. Horrible horrible horrible acting kept distracting me all the time. It's a good thing they don't speak much in the movie and I'm not even going to mention that Ash'es face looks exactly the same no matter what she's doing. Oh well I just did. It's probably better for people who don't understand the language maybe it sounds foreign and sophisticated and people believe that it's the translation that makes dialogue sound shallow. Trust me translation is actually helping most of the time.Stunning visuals? I'm not so sure. For me the visuals were actually pretty artificial with that annoying postcardtype sky. Also having to watch the same scenes over and over again was pretty tiring as well. Would it hurt so much to shoot at some other locations as well? I liked the urban shots but after some time I really really wanted to see something new.The story is pretty thin almost to the point of nonexistence. We don't find out anything about the basic reality why exactly Ash wants to go to Special A and so on. I think those who think this movie was sophisticated have simply created their own story themselves. I mean it's one thing if a movie makes you think another if you have to write the story yourself to make any sense of what's happening on the screen. Avalon's story is so generic that you can give it pretty much any meaning background and motivation you want. Maybe that's what people like in this movie. For me watching it was a rather painful experience at times did I mention bad acting?. It's not your average Hollywood movie but it doesn't make it a good one. An interesting experience but still I wouldn't necessarily want to repeat it.".

A fascinating story that is obviously shot by a master. The pace of this movie is noticeably slower than typical Hollywood movies. The long camera shots are reminiscent of Kubrick with a uniquely different feel. Though I'm still confused about the story itself this is a wonderful movie well worth watching.810 for the whole package. Just don't expect to be getting another Matrix".

	schema:headline " What's real and what isn't";
	schema:reviewBody "AvalonThere's some Matrix and eXistenz here. And some 1984 as well with the game master looking like Big Brother. The plot is set in the dystopian near future where things are not terrible they are just sucked dry. Consequently the biggest game in town is the virtual reality called Avalon played by some and watched by most. In Avalon the player gets into a dentist chair and puts a weird helm on and away they go dropped right into a guerrilla warfare situation. They can win or they can lose. Ash our heroine is mainly a winner who aside from a devoted Basset Hound doesn't have a friend in the world nor much of a life. Most of the discussions about the film concern two issues what's real and what's not? Fair enough. Here's my take The real is anything that is not unreal. Hence the movie as a whole is just light on a screen and is therefore unreal. That point aside let's now examine what parts of the movie are to be taken as real and what parts are not. Using the above criterion any part that has something unreal that is contrary to the laws of nature would be unreal and any part that didn't have something unreal would be possibly real. Thus all of the first part of the film is not real. The first part is not real because it is in sepia monochrome and it has several exact playbacks. The real world is not in sepia and there is no playback for reality. The past is fixed and can't be recalled. The past certainly can't be repeated exactly. In life there is no playback. Of course all the battles are fake as things in the real world don't shatter and atomize when hit. How about the last part where Ash wakes up in the dentist's chair in her drab apartment? That might have been real except that the Bishop shows her a book about Arthur that has blank pages and Ash's beloved Basset disappeared while a big meal was being cooked for him. Real dogs don't just disappear especially at dinner time. What about the hospital scene? Nothing unreal there. So we don't know for sure that it is not real. The Bishop is present outside the hospital sighting Ash with his weird yellow spy glass. He seems to be real there but we don't really know that for sure. Murphy certainly looks like he is in some vegetative state brain dead and unreturned. That leaves Special A or Class Real. Is Class Real real? The short answer is No! Multiple unreal things happen in Class Real The colors are all saturated white is withdrawn from them by digital manipulation. Because of this effect Murphy's chest wounds look too red. The wounds are certainly too big and too bloody. The Walther PPK 7.65 mm that Ash shoots Murphy with never makes holes that bleed in the entrance wounds. In fact you have to look damn carefully to find the entrance wounds for that bullet. Furthermore Murphy proves he is not real when he shatters and atomizes. Ash proves she is not real because the gray streak in her hair is gone and she looks 15 years younger and 100 healthier in Class Real. Real people don't change that fast or that much. The last scene also shows the reappearance of the ghost child. That can't be real. And the restart of the Avalon game after Ash aims at the ghost child. That can't be real. Conclusion Ash is unreturned and in coma somewhere back in the hospital.Appraisal Although tedious and sluggish by western standards this movie played well in Japan where audiences are more into meditating on the significance of mediated realities. The movie is logically coherent once the initial premises are accepted. Avalon is likely to find a cult following along side Matrix and eXistenZ.".

VCRs were just coming on the market so I had to wait a few years till Cinemax showed it in the early morning. I stayed up most of the night to satisfy my prurient interest and what I ended up with was a film I didn't want to end a tune that played over and over again in my head for days and one of my most favorite movies.Yes this movie is a comedy sometimes a very black comedy and sometimes a satire filled with irony. Yes it's a romance all about a wonderful romance that sparks up between two seemingly opposite people in the strangest of places at the strangest of times under the strangest of circumstances the way romance quite often does. And at times there's sadness and pain to tug at your heart. It's all about discovering who you really are when you've lost your way in all life's confusion and also about perhaps being better than your parents when you get older and more like them.Lemmon is the consummate cad Juliet Mills the most charming Englishwoman to grace a celluloid comedy Clive Revill is perfect in his most Oscardeserving role as the hotel manager Carlo Carlucci the Italian cast members never fail to entertain and the music is as catchy and memorable as any Bernstein or Tiomkin or Goldsmith score. The movie may be 212 hours long but the time passes quickly as Lemmon and Mills rediscover love and youth and passion and I always find myself wishing that I could see the two lovers returning a year later like their parents.Billy Wilder may have given us dramatic gems like Stalag 17 Double Indemnity The Lost Weekend and Sunset Boulevard given us comedic gems like Seven Year Itch and Some Like It Hot and romantic gems like The Apartment and Irma La Douce but it wasn't till the end of his career that he could take qualities from all of those and give them a magical lyrical feel and atmosphere and come up with a jewel like Avanti!".

How I wish I could obtain a soundtrack of this delightful score. The scene when Pamela Pigott  Juliet Mills  tours the city on a horse drawn carriage and later running from her new found admirers is beautiful with the music so perfect.Also when Pamela and Wendell  Jack Lemmon  have their evening meal together  it is again a beautiful music score. Jack Lemmon as the bombastic Wendell Armbruster is as always great. Juliet Mills as Pamela Pigott looks far too gorgeous to be ridiculed by Armbruster but she shines in her finest ever role. However for me the film is stolen completely by Clive Revill as the hotel manager what a sublime performance. Watch his every movement his every expression his delivery of every line.It is a captivating performance totally exquisite. Clive Revill is an actor sorely neglected by the film world.Billy Wilder's film is so very neglected and it's a pity as this is the perfect film. Watch the beautiful poignant sequence at the mortuary as Pamela and Wendell view the bodies of their mother and father respectively. And again watch Clive Revill alongside Lemmon and Mills acting with only movement expression and not a word. The lighting in this scene is so wonderful it is dark and depressing with the exception of a shaft of sunlight penetrating the smallest of windows. Wilder manages to wring excellent portrayals out of even the most minor of characters. Watch Avanti and savour the acting the music and the scenery.".

	schema:reviewBody "Billy Wilder  Jack Lemmon didn't go straight for the belly laughs in this departure from their usual alloutcrazy comedies. Fans of the masters will be pleasantly surprised by this delightful romantic comedy which captivates the viewer from the very start. Mezmerizing backdrop music plays as though secretly staged by Cupid standing by to assure that lovebirds will find one another. Lemmon plays the son of a megawealthy American business man who had to drop everything to fly to Italy in order to claim the father's remains after a car accident. En route to his late father's final stop Lemmon runs in to a persistent young woman who turns out to be the daughter of the woman with whom the father had had a lengthy affair and who was found lovingly slung around his neck as they both died in said accident.The situation seems rather awkward at first but eventually Lemmon and the young woman begin following into the exact same steps their departed parents had done years earlier. The picture is completed by a brilliant supporting cast of hotel personnel and colorful locals. The performance of the multitalented and everpresentminded hotel manager was Oscar worthy.Listening to the testimony of all people asked Lemmon learns that his late father and his friend were viewed as Royalty nothing less than figures from a fairy tale. The concluding scenes are the final touches to a most enchanting romantic comedy one that has few rivals in its category. Billy Wilder has done it again. What he missed in big laughs he made up in many magic moments and gentle pressures to your tear glands. One of the very best out there. Belissima!".

En route to his late father's final stop Lemmon runs in to a persistent young woman who turns out to be the daughter of the woman with whom the father had had a lengthy affair and who was found lovingly slung around his neck as they both died in said accident.The situation seems rather awkward at first but eventually Lemmon and the young woman begin following into the exact same steps their departed parents had done years earlier. The picture is completed by a brilliant supporting cast of hotel personnel and colorful locals. The performance of the multitalented and everpresentminded hotel manager was Oscar worthy.Listening to the testimony of all people asked Lemmon learns that his late father and his friend were viewed as Royalty nothing less than figures from a fairy tale. The concluding scenes are the final touches to a most enchanting romantic comedy one that has few rivals in its category. Billy Wilder has done it again. What he missed in big laughs he made up in many magic moments and gentle pressures to your tear glands. One of the very best out there. Belissima!";

In this film Wendell Armbuster Junior the always brilliant Jack Lemmon has travelled to Italy to pick up the recently deceased body of his father. Running on occasion into an English woman by the name of Pamela Piggott Juliet Mills Wendell experiences the beauty of the small Isle Of Ischia as a friendship develops with the neurotic Miss Piggott.The beauty of Avanti is it's simplicity. Jack Lemmon travels to Italy as one man and leaves another. Learning the truth behind his fathers visits to Ischia Lemmon slowly begins to emulate his father and fall for his father's lover's daughter. Taught to relax and enjoy life Lemmon's character develops from a mad rushing rude businessman into a friendly romantic with a lust for life. Juliet Mills' Miss Piggott equally changes as she develops from a paranoid unhappy diet obsessed nut into a happy laid back beautiful woman with an equal love for life as Lemmon. Together the couple work beautifully together firstly sparring and later uniting.This film is wonderful for many reasons. As well as the aforementioned change amongst the starring cast Clive Revill as the hotel manager Carlo Carlucci is superb and has some of the films funniest lines. Added to the acting abilities the brilliant direction of Billy Wilder and already looking like a piece of genius.Ultimately though as well as the acting and directing the three things which really make this film stand out are the often hilarious script the stunning addictive soundtrack and the picturesque views. After watching Avanti the one thing most viewers want is to instantly be transported away from where ever they are to the beautiful landscapes of the Italian Islands. With glorious sunshine rocks in the water where you can relax and watch the Sun come up and classical buildings the impression is that the people to come out of this film the best were the tourist trade of this beautiful Isle.Truth be told there's hardly any criticism which can be given to this film. Starting brilliantly from the offset there's no slow start just like there's no awkward ending. The only negative aspect perhaps is that it makes us wish we were somewhere else. Even this though is not as much a negative as a frustration. Avanti is an amazing film which makes us smile and makes us laugh. It reminds us of the beauty of the world and it reminds us of how great life can be. This is one for the ages.".

During his trip the British woman Pamela Piggott Juliet Mills tries to start a conversation with him but the impolite executive does not give a chance to her. In Ischia the manager of Hotel Excelsior Carlo Carlucci Clive Revill welcomes Wendell telling that it is a place that heals everything he helps him with the Italian bureaucracy and to get a sealed zinc casket in Amalfi to release the corpse from the morgue. When Wendell meets Pamela in the hotel he discovers that his father and her mother had been lovers for ten years and they had met each other every year from July 15th to August 15th. Wendell offers to help Pamela who is needy and has weight problem and they decide to follow the routine of his father and their mother finding why the couple had had a so long love affair.Avanti! is another delightful movie of the genius Billy Wilder. This witty ironic and dramatic romantic comedy has another partnership with Jack Lemmon in the lead role of a rude and tough executive that is surprised with the secret relief valve of his father's life in the wonderful Italy. The sweet and charming Juliet Mills is perfect in the role of the complexed and needy Pamela. And Clive Revill is fantastic in the role of an experienced hotel manager that fixes everything in the Hotel Excelsior and his performance deserved a nomination to the Oscar. The plot is supported by magnificent landscapes and one of the most beautiful soundtracks of the cinema history. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Avanti  Amantes  Italiana Avanti ...Italian Lovers".

	schema:reviewBody "'Avanti' Billy Wilder's last notable film is defined by absence.  Most obviously so in the case of the central couple playing out their relationship in the shadow of the dead parents they have come to bury an absence comically mirrored when their corpses are snatched by the disgruntled peasants on whose farm their car crashed. It is also the insistent absence of the home Armbruster has temporarily left behind intruding not only in the phone calls regularly interrupting his burgeoning relationship with Pamela but in his personality his worries as an executive and the souldestroying banality of his marriage resulting in the raging black hole that arrives in Italy condescending and insulting everything in sight.  The irony of this film is that these two absences cancel each other out and give Armbruster a definite gain the return of his humanity.  Again this is comically mirrored in Pamela's desire to lose weight her gaining pounds in direct proportion to her happiness.Once again Wilder is concerned with double lives that gaping chasm between duty and desire.  Cynical as ever he finds that the only way to reconcile the two to stay true to yourself is to deceive curative adultery.  The romance in this romantic comedy is sublime if you are willing to give into it  and I do every time  but Wilder's vision hasn't softened. Mr Ambruster Sr.'s monthlong trips for extramarital succour did not make him a better or more egalitarian human being.  The double life for him was what it has always been for successful men where society is based on a rigid code of morality or bourgeois respectability.  He might have been a dear old lover in Italy but in America he remained a consummate hypocrite upholding phoney religious ideals hobnobbing with highranking government officials engaged in bombing Asian civilians running his huge multinational with Nixonian corruption treating his ThirdWorld employees like dirt.  The double life celebrated at the end on an ironical wave of sentiment is an ingeniously American twofaced compartmentalising of duty and desire  instead of repressing one and letting it get out of violent hand it is pushed somewhere else indulged in its proper place and the status quo so painstakingly defended by hotel director Carlucci remains static. This is not to suggest that Armbruster will follow this route maybe he will become a genuinely more decent person but the film has been paralleling his move towards to his father to the point where he ritually imitates him like a ghost?.  His first act on reaching America will be a massive act of deceit burying a Mafia lackey in front of Kissinger but this subversive act will be known only to three people.  There will be no apple carts turned.  So the familiar Wilder transformation scene on the plane  where Armbruster changes suits with Dr Fleischmann  and the Wilderean prevalance of mirrors suggest not that Armbruster will transform his personality but that he will become adept at living two lives literally wearing two suits.'Avanti' has always been my favourite Wilder film although it's now been surpassed by 'Private life of Sherlock Holmes' but I can understand why people might want to resist it  it is based on a play and wallows in rather than trying to transcend its theatricality although there is a complex pattern of visual echoes e.g. opening windows to let in the sun at hotel and morgue.  Its mixture of farce black comedy and romance will not be to every taste and some may feel the sentimental manipulation too much although I hope I've showed how Wilder manipulates this.  Others might find the usual Wilder trading in stereotypes worrying.  In its defence I can only offer the noncinematic virtues of strong characterisation brilliant acting Clive Revill as Carlucci is particularly cherishable a tonal balance rare in Wilder cleverly worked out situations and bellyachingly funny dialogue.  The less 'relevant' Wilder became the more he relaxed his need to breathlessly wisecrack and these late works seem to me much more satisfactory and have dated much better. Look at the scene where Armbruster and Pamela identify their parents' bodies like a wedding ceremony a brilliant encapsulation of Wilder's complex art.".

	schema:reviewBody "After decades of dishing out enough cynicism to make a clergyman lose all faith in humanity I'm almost glad that by 1972 director Billy Wilder and coscreenwriter I.A.L. Diamond had gotten most of it out of their system. Wilder's fifth film with Jack Lemmon 'Avanti! 1972' can only be described as a pleasant comedy  so pleasant in fact that our lead character commits adultery seemingly out of politeness. There are of course elements of satire concerning foreign policy and the miles of redtape surrounding international commerce but the overwhelming emotional tone is one of bittersweet fulfillment. This is a great director approaching the twilight of his life and career and finally recognising that there is after all much goodness in this world even if one must travel to Italy in order to experience it. Nevertheless the three major creative talents Wilder Diamond and Lemmon would subsequently return to cynical quickfire screwball with 'The Front Page 1974' an adaptation of the same play that spawned Howard Hawks' 'His Girl Friday 1940.'Jack Lemmon plays Wendell Armbruster Jr a wealthy American businessman who boards the first plane to Italy following the news of his father's death. Wendell Armbruster Sr was killed in an automobile accident while on his annual pilgrimage to the Grand Hotel Excelsior where he goes he says to rejuvenate in their famous Italian mud baths. It doesn't take long however for Wendell to discover that his muchrespected father had not died alone and that his secret English mistress of ten years had also perished when their vehicle ploughed off a winding road and into a vineyard. Pamela Piggott Juliet Mills the mistress' openminded daughter has also arrived in the country to claim her mother's body and Wendell treats her poorly his steadfast morals refusing to acknowledge their parents' liaison for the great love that it was. As the two corpses become embroiled in endless lengths of red tape  including the need to acquire two zinclined coffins and no shortage of obscure contracts to be signed  Wendell and Pamela begin to understand their close connection and form a touching relationship of their own.Though the two leads both deliver sterling comedic performances Clive Revill is undoubtedly the film's highlight as Carlo Carlucci the world's most accommodating hotel manager. Blessed with political connections of all kinds and an inability to sleep until the hotel's offseason Carlo darts endlessly across town to tie up all the loose ends apparently expecting nothing in return  he's probably Wilder's alltime nicest comedic creation. The narrative style is similar to that of Arthur Hiller's 'The Out of Towners 1970' in that the story is comprised of many consistentlymounting setbacks though the overall effect is far less frustrating for the audience and spares sufficient time to allow some important character development. There is also a rather unnecessary subplot involving a deported American immigrant and his disturbinglymasculine girlfriend and the film however nice its intentions does run about half an hour overtime. Nevertheless 'Avanti!' is a mature romantic comedy with memorable performances and a very enjoyable story I wouldn't be surprised if it warms to me greatly with repeat viewings.".

Wilder was of course a master of the meetcute and one could even argue that he had a childlike preoccupation with them unless of course you appreciate the thought that goes into them. Some filmmaker's careers  notably Orson Welles  are littered with unrealized projects Wilder left a list of unrealized meetcutes behind him like the two psychiatrists who both send their couches out for reupholstering and guess what ... This time around the protagonists rather than meeting over a couple of stiff drinks do so over a couple of stiffs his Jack Lemmon father and her Juliet Mills mother who have enjoyed a sametimenextyear extra marital fling for the last ten years on the photogenic island of Ischia and might be doing so still had their car not run off the road. We learn this relatively quickly which was what I meant about knowing how it's going to pan out from reel 1. The trick is of course to start with a pair of antagonists and watch and wait for them to realize what we've known all along. The Italian setting is apposite because this kind of lovehate thing arguably began with Beatrice and Benedek who might also arguably have had a better scriptwriter than Wilder and Izzy Diamond on the other hand ... The film is replete with Wilder 'touches' such as the official in the morgue meticulously arranging forms stamps and pads or the nonogenarian dancing with his young nurses  and recalling Lemmon himself dancing with 'senior citizen' Joe E. Brown in Wilder's Some Like It Hot. Music was a great love of Wilder's life and whilst very few of his films are totally music free in others it plays a significant part  think of in no particular order Love In The Afternoon Sabrina Fair One Two Three etc  and here he uses a background of evocative 'mood' music notably the lovely Senza Fine which does double duty translating as it does to 'without end'. Wilder has again turned for his source material to a play by Samuel Taylor who also wrote Sabrina and again Taylor has conceived a souffl the epitome of Romantic Comedy that is only enhanced by Wilder's mordant wit. It may be lateblooming Wilder but the bloom is definitely on this rose. One to cherish.".

	schema:headline " Amiable Wilder comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of Billy Wilder's lesser known films and when it opened in the early 1970's it was dismissed by most critics. One of the reasons is it's incredible length. Story is about an American businessman named Wendell Armbruster Jack Lemmon who travels to Italy to claim the body of his father who has died in a car crash. He wants the body transported back to the states immediately so that he can have a big funeral on closed circuit television for his company. When he arrives he meets Carlucci Clive Revill who is the manager of the hotel that his father stays at and he is informed that his father did not die alone in the car and he meets Pamela Piggott Juliet Mills. Pamela's mother also died in the car and Wendell discovers that his father has been having an affair for the last ten years. Both Wendell and Pamela have a difficult time getting the bodies ready to be shipped because special coffins have to be ordered and transportation forms have to be signed by judges that are nowhere to be found. Pamela complains about her weight and she also suggests that both bodies stay in Italy to be buried but Wendell objects. Then both bodies are stolen and held for ransom but back at the hotel a bellhop named Bruno Gianfranco Barra has photo's and is blackmailing Wendell because he wants a visa to go back to America. This film was made after Billy Wilder's best years but he was still a very good director and would go on to direct some very good films. This is not one of his best although it's not a bad film. The big thing that hurts the film is it's two and a half hour length! Did this really have to be 2 12 hours long? I can't imagine sitting in a theater watching a fairly good romanticcomedy for that long and I've sat through a lot of long films. There are some scenes that just go on too long and at certain points the film would start to meander. But I am giving this a mild recommendation and one reason would be that this definitely plays better when your at home watching it on television. Another plus for this film is the wonderful performance of Revill. His character is vital to the story and he actually helps hold the film together. We all should be so lucky to have a gentleman like this watching our backs! And I thought Lemmon had good chemistry with Mills. She never got enough opportunities in her career to show what a good actress she is. And I have one thing to say about the nudity that was asked of her in this film. I don't care if it's not proper to say this but her nudity was one of the highlights of the film. As a man who grew up in the 60's and 70's and watched Nanny and the Professor this was really something to behold. I thought she looked beautiful and I think it was in the film to show the viewers that her character shouldn't complain too much about her weight. Like in all of Wilder's films the dialogue is sharp and crisp That's a lot of Trotta's! Far from being one of Wilder's better films but the performances by Lemmon Mills and Revill make up for the overlong story.".

To begin with Lemmon's character was positively unlikable for most of the movie.  Also the premise of the movie was not very nice if one thinks about it both he and his father cheated on their wives with no reason given except that they wanted to. This movie would have been much more enjoyable if the premise had involved men who were single divorced or widowed available for a true love affair not a yearly tryst. Who wants to see lovers with no real future?  Not I.  Another thing Mills obsesses about being overweight throughout the film.  Please spare me. Mills is the best thing in this film.  She's very pleasant to look at and her character is nice.  Wilder's directing was off in this movie.  All of the scenes in The Apartment rang true.  Not so in this movie.  Some were overdone and some were just off.  One can try to like this movie but really it's a disappointment.".

There he discovers Pamela Piggot Juliet Mills the daughter of his father's mistress. Armbruster had thought that his dad made yearly trips to Italy to cure his bad back not to have a longrunning affair during July and August of every year.This film bathes me in a warm glow. It is funny fierce sexy and sentimental and its Ischia Italy scenes are like a Mediterranean vacation.Samuel Taylor who wrote Sabrina wrote the original play this was adapted for the screen by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. Wilder directed.Wilder could be utterly caustic and genuinely sentimental by turns. Example Bruno a hotel valet attempts to blackmail Armbruster. The scene is played with the subtlety of a cat walking across a roof. At first Bruno seems the fawning provincial goof whom Armbruster must humor slowly Armbruster realizes that Bruno is a boa constrictor wrapping himself around his neck. And yet nothing overt is said.A greater example of a Wilder change of tone from biting satire morphing into the warmest of sentiment is the change in Jack Lemmon's Wendell Armbruster.So often the main characters in a romantic comedy meet cute hate each other at first and then come to like each other. Almost all actors in romcoms are asked to carry out this change few can actually manage it. Tom Hanks is one  you really believe his change in You've Got Mail. But Jack Lemmon is the master. As many times as I've seen this movie I am in awe of how he leads me around wherever he wants me to go.At first he is so abrasive so obnoxious and so laughoutloud comical you enjoy seeing him being shafted by the Trotta brothers.And then once he says Permisso to Pamela Piggott you see a new man emerge  but very believably you get it that this new warm decent person is the same Wendell Armbruster you've been annoyed by all along  just a different side of him that Pamela has brought to life.It's breathtaking. Lemmon executes a similarly magnificent feat in The Apartment going from the creepy morally compromised spineless Buddy Boy of early scenes to a man worthy to share a card game with his beloved Miss Kubelik.Juliet Mills is poignant and adorable as Pamela Piggott the woman who works the change in Armbruster. Unfortunately Wilder never really learned how to write a full female character and Mills is given tragically little to do but what she does do is understated but clearly the inspiration for Armbruster's change.Oh and yes Mills does remove her blouse and yes they are magnificent. Armbruster's attempt to shield her from the gaze of sardine fisherman is hysterical.Pamela is in a long line of free spirits who free up uptight men from Jean Arthur in You Can't Take It With You to Goldie Hawn in Butterflies are Free. This type of female lead was popular both during the heyday of screwball comedies during the Depression and in the Sixties  early seventies.There are a lot of jokes here that rely on stereotypes of Italians for their punch. In any case the Italians almost always come out on top. Wilder's cheap shots at Catholicism are nasty and gratuitous but obviously did not ruin the movie for me.Clive Revill is a bonus as a hotel manager who can work any magic his favored guests may require. His body language is so Italian I was surprised to discover that he's from New Zealand.".

I will say that Nils Malmros did a formidable job and theres no faulting his research and story telling Malmros is a doctor as well as a film maker and he did a tenure at the National Hospital in Thorshavn so he could make the research for this film. I like the film a lot but must point out a couple of weak points Namely the two male love interests Lars Simonsens Hr. Poul and Peter Reichardts Andreas Heyde. They are both weak characters and its not believeable that a woman like Barbara brilliantly played by Anneke von der Lippe should fall for either of them. The film is very faithful to the book and the scenery is breathtaking but the key players lets the film down. 7 stars out of 10.".

I will say that Nils Malmros did a formidable job and theres no faulting his research and story telling Malmros is a doctor as well as a film maker and he did a tenure at the National Hospital in Thorshavn so he could make the research for this film. I like the film a lot but must point out a couple of weak points Namely the two male love interests Lars Simonsens Hr. Poul and Peter Reichardts Andreas Heyde. They are both weak characters and its not believeable that a woman like Barbara brilliantly played by Anneke von der Lippe should fall for either of them. The film is very faithful to the book and the scenery is breathtaking but the key players lets the film down. 7 stars out of 10.";

This film was the third in a come back of sorts for Leander who was persona non grata in her adopted country after the war because when the going got rough Zarah got going back to her native Sweden that is. She's not a badlooking woman but her figure can only be described as matronly and her acting as somnambulistic.

It is a fresh new approach void of the usual bloody violence and hatred with no commentary or voiceover where reallife people enact a macabre and surrealist play. It is this kind of documentaries that give me hope because I can see that there are still people in the midst of all this hatred that can still retain enough lucidity to recognize what they see for what it is  a shame. Two peoples with so much in common entangled in a death embrace that will consume them both. Just like the director of the documentary we want to scream at them  What are you doing ?!".

Is it possible to understand the suicide of the zealots and not the suicide bombers who feel they have nothing much to lose? Just limiting ourselves to the Masada scenes it is interesting to see the different groups answering the question about if Jewish law allows suicide. The answers varied from It is forbidden but the reasons the zealots had were valid exceptions to The zealots were not religious and their suicide was not justified at allThen there is the justification of the suicide bombers. To me it is a terrible vicious circle. That fence would not be there if it were not for suicide bombers. Yet the humiliation and hardship it causes may just push some more Palestinians into it.As to the soldiers I felt pity for them even if their acts do not seem justified. Once upon a time I was one of them and in Gaza as much as I hated it I knew that if we did not react firmly to a stone thrown at us during patrol the next time it would be a grenade. I do hope more people do sit through this movie. It might not be easy to watch but it should make people think and maybe also look at the situation from the other side.Once the majority on both sides are able to understand the other side of the coin maybe there will be a chance of lasting peace.

But he's Stallone with all the baggage that this carries both good and bad so whilst he should know better his work in the light hearted flicks is quite often overlooked.If I were assisting Mr. Stallone's career I would have suggested putting this out in film and keeping 'Get Carter' for the nearest black hole. The director of this film works well but should be shot on sight for one scene where the Merc is accelerating from the garage and the cars behind are happily catching up.Madeline Stowe has rarely been annoying to me and in this film one has to admire her again her for her amazing physical shape she's beautiful with a figure that a lot of current 20yearolds round here could never aspire to! She deftly handles both the comic and the pathos of the script in much the same way as Stakeout 1.Nice to know that Quinn and Stowe did it again for the last time with a simple story about adultery and revenge rather than a simple story about adultery and revenge. Rent it with an open mind. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Quinn R.I.P.".

A grand old man who gave us lots of moments in hundreds of films from bad guys to good guys always in the character realm.  This film with Maddy Stowe and Sly Stallone is a fun film that wanders between being a kind of Prizzi's Honor in the chickflick mode to a rather slapstick comedy.  However what the reviewers herein who are panning Stallone with their he's over the hill comments seem to miss is that old Sly can do more than Arnie Swartzenegger clenched teeth grimacing action films with usually lousy story lines.  True this film at times can't seem to make up its mind whether to be a black comedy or prattfall filled lampoon of the traditional gangstermafioso genre.  No matter.  It's fun because Stowe and Stallone are a delight to watch.  Although it does make one sad to know this was old Tony's last film we should appreciate he worked right up to the last gasp as it were.

Short as it may be THAT scene was cinematic magic especially if you study Quinn's face as he delivers the words. The briefest of pauses makes you wonder if the reality of that line had momentarily struck him fatally ill as he was with throat cancer during shooting. He died before the film's release bringing to an end one of Hollywood's most illustrious screen careers  one that spanned six decades. Restricted as the role of Angelo was it was ENOUGH to say goodbye with and with such dignity too. Quinn conveyed more in his ten minutes on screen here than others have amassed in a lifetime. He would have been delighted to be working up to his last breath literally. Stallone even if you really look closely appears to extend a real reverence to his costar in those opening minutes. I think to have any hope of either understanding or even liking this film you would need to be over 40 with a depth and awareness not everyone has. It is NOT a surface film. If that is all you can see you're wasting your time. There is fun chemistry humor subtle and less so....and a decent storyline. Whether you view it as parodying THE GODFATHER which at times it appears to be doing or telling a less than straightforward tale of revenge...mafioso style this film has genuine moments of endearing drama. Many reviewers appear to feel shortchanged expecting as they were THE VALACHI PAPERS 2 or THE CURSE OF DON CORLEONE....nor was this wallowing in the putrid wake of OSCAR Stallone's last stab as it were at portraying the unfunny eccentricities of la cosa nostra.I won't bother rehashing the plotline....enough here have done that. I would simply say that it is a great shame it went straight to video  Quinn deserved way more respect than that and SO did this film. I agree with the reviewer who offered a 6.6 as being reasonable.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is worth watching for the pictureperfect comic timing of the actress Madeleine Stowe. Her foil is the hangdog laidback Sylvester Stallone and this film includes some of Sly's finest work in years.Stowe's character Jennifer is the spoiled daughter of a mafia don Sly's character Frankie is the trusted bodyguard. From start to finish there were hilarious moments of comedy delivered primarily by the gifted Stowe.The script by Will Adis included many inspired bits and takeoffs on various mafia films. The funniest sequence is when Jennifer learns the mafia meaning of the word whack and she decides to snuff out the aged don who killed her father. A whirlwind romance and wedding follow and on the fateful wedding night Jennifer sees to it the old don becomes excited just enough to become a flatliner! Again the timing takes and line deliveries were done to perfection by Stowe.A recent film entitled Spanglish received great acclaim as parody of bourgeois culture in L.A. But that film pales alongside the witty and wellcrafted Avenging Angelo. In fact Spanglish could have benefited from all of the strengths of Avenging Angelo including the good scripting comic setups and above all the style evoked by an underrated comedienne like Madeleine Stowe.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is worth watching for the pictureperfect comic timing of the actress Madeleine Stowe. Her foil is the hangdog laidback Sylvester Stallone and this film includes some of Sly's finest work in years.Stowe's character Jennifer is the spoiled daughter of a mafia don Sly's character Frankie is the trusted bodyguard. From start to finish there were hilarious moments of comedy delivered primarily by the gifted Stowe.The script by Will Adis included many inspired bits and takeoffs on various mafia films. The funniest sequence is when Jennifer learns the mafia meaning of the word whack and she decides to snuff out the aged don who killed her father. A whirlwind romance and wedding follow and on the fateful wedding night Jennifer sees to it the old don becomes excited just enough to become a flatliner! Again the timing takes and line deliveries were done to perfection by Stowe.A recent film entitled Spanglish received great acclaim as parody of bourgeois culture in L.A. But that film pales alongside the witty and wellcrafted Avenging Angelo. In fact Spanglish could have benefited from all of the strengths of Avenging Angelo including the good scripting comic setups and above all the style evoked by an underrated comedienne like Madeleine Stowe.";

Sylvester Stallone is a great actor no doubt about that but the character here is faced with comedic situations and even has some funny lines. I admire the change that Stallone made to his roles but let's face it... he's not funny at all. He can do great in drama action... but not comedy!! Madline Stowe was fine but not convencing enough. It was obvious from the first look that there was no chemistry between the two. That can be seen clearly from the seen where Frankie trains Jennifer the cat walk. to me that's the worst scene in the movie.I personally liked the Funeral scene. I felt as if it was the last goodbye to Anthony Quinn. In short... The movie is entertaining but not worth going all the way to the theatre. If you are a Quinn fan then rent it to see him for the last time.".

If you don't like foolish silliness then don't bother watching this film.

I found myself laughing at things I normally would not laugh at but the timing was perfect and completely caught me without warning. This is another example of how Stallone is moving away from the stereo typical characters he has helped create not to say he won't do more of those but he continues to branch out.This movie is dedicated to the memory of Anthony Quinn. This was his very last film appearance. His work on this film was long enough considering his health and age. Watch the featurette for more on Anthony Quinn. It may bring tears to your eyes to remember this wonderful man and the many wonderful performances he has given us over six decades.There's a little mystery thrown into the movie. Watch for clues here and there and see if you can solve the mystery.".

The film stars Sylvester Stallone as Quinn's right hand man who must deliver a message to Quinn's daughter and protect her before it's too late. Quinn's daughter is played by the sexy Madeleine Stowe. Along the way there's comedy and romance between Stallone and Stowe and comedy between them and the killers trying to get them. Stallone continues a mediocre trend of appearances since his good performance in Cop Land with the exception of Get Carter. Stowe has been seen infrequently in recent years and may be falling victim to Hollywood's failure to produce good parts for women over 40. Quinn adds good support in his brief appearance as a crime figure. The two main problems with the film are that the chemistry between Stallone and Stowe is shaky at times and the plot is fairly predictable and routine in its execution. Stallone and Stowe do make it watchable though.  of 4 stars.".

The light hummer along with upbeat music throughout made this move a pleasure to view.SynopsisThe movie is about a woman who has grown up wealthy not knowing that her parents are not her REAL parents.  Throughout her whole life she has been watched by her real fathers body guard Stallone who kept her out of trouble and assisted in ensuring no one did her wrong.Her real father is a Mob boss and her mother died giving birth to her. Because her real father had enemies that swear to kill any child he would ever have her father secretly gave her to a poor family along with lots of money so they could live a lavish lifestyle.  The only catch was they were never to tell her that she was adopted or who her real father was.After being killed the Mob boss left instructions with his body guard to show a DVD video of him explaining the truth to his daughter.  Stallone does this but in the process leads the enemy's right to his daughter.  Stallone stays with her to protect her and as the name of the movie implies she decides to avenge her father's death.".

It sucks to see him trying to achieve his goals just by merely threatening people like a little school girl. You better give me the information I need or I'll obviously keep shooting around you or hold you in some grip I'll do anything unless it makes you bleed. The story is shockingly uninteresting because I've seen it hundreds of times before. Maybe the mafia just isn't what it used to be. Stallone's character is not 60 years old which would be logical the facelifts and the bull hormones are getting painful to watch. You really start to wonder why this movie was ever made in the first place. With no cinema release it has to get back the budget from DVD rentals and why would you rent this when you can just get Rambo III and actually see the same guy doing stuff that's lots more entertaining? Despite patheticit was still a good choice to go back to his two franchises after this because honestly this is as relevant as the newest Seagal.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a story about a woman who is not who she believes she was. After a family boss Angelo Anthony Quinn in his last role before his death is whacked by a rival family. His former bodyguard Frankie Sylvester Stallone delivers a tape to his daughter Jennifer Madeleine Stowe. The tape informs her that he was her father and had to give her to another couple for her own safety due to the business he was in and the danger she was in. From that point on Frankie then began looking after Jennifer until he was sure she was safe.It sounds and looks more like an actioncrime drama movie at first but once she finds out who she is that is where it turns into a chick flick. Madeleine Stowe was all right as Jennifer but they could have made a much better choice. Jennifer Lopez could have played the role which proves it is a chick flick but I'd still rather have someone different. Need more proof? There is a scene where Frankie tries to teach Jennifer how to walk more like a woman through demonstration.Although it did fall more into the chick flick category more than any other it did have it's moments to keep the men entertained as well. A few shootings fight scenes and even a few farts for laughs. If I had to pick a movie that was similar it would be The Whole Nine Yards with Bruce Willis as the suburbanite hitman although Avenging Angelo was not meant to be a comedy.I hate to say this but Stallone is not aging well at all. He needs to pick better roles altogether. This was one of his better ones recently but can do better. Shade comes to mind as one of his better achievements of recent years and should pick more roles like that. He pretty much jumped the shark around Copland and he certainly does not look like Rocky or Rambo anymore which is a shame. I loved those movies and would have liked to see more of that nature from him. Time waits for no man I suppose.Another actor who did a good job here was Billy Gardell who played Bruno the hitman. He reminds me a bit of Chris Penn and I liked his character here. 6.510".

But despite differences they both have each other's back. I liked Ving Rhames character as well Melvin. Melvin showed that the street mentality never leaves a street thug but he can learn to make better and more positive choices. His character showed that anyone can make it in life once they have accepted who they are and where they are going. The women played strong roles as well. Not the typical cinematic role for a black woman either. Both Yvette and Jody's mother Juanita proved to be strong black women in their own way. Excellent movie a little sluggish once or twice but whose life isn't?! Singleton kept it true to the game. No one's life is truly cinematic if it was then we wouldn't need cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really liked Baby Boy.  But maybe that's because I'm as white as they come.  I've just read some other User Comments here and whether John Singleton does or does not dishup nothing but stereotypes about blacks I won't debate.  Look I totally dug this film because of other reasons. While watching Baby Boy I had two thoughts  1 that I don't relate to the 'black' culture presented but 2 this didn't matter because I did relate TOTALLY to a lot of the issues at the core of this story. Psychological and emotional issues about growing up about cheating about love about undesirable characters working their way back into your life and screwing everything up.  And so on.  OK I understand Users' complaints here about stereotypes but I say to them Don't worry about it... this white guy kind of thought the same thing too and so this movie didn't paint a picture for me of 'what all blacks' lifestyles must be.'  Dudes all I saw were universal themes about like I said about love about becoming a responsible adult and all that.  White people go thru exactly the same shi.. stuff.  Those universal themes just happened to be wrapped up in some kind of black wrapping paper.  This viewer set that paper aside and appreciated the gift inside.  This movie really pressed some emotional buttons with me and I appreciated it.  And by the way we white people don't assume that all black people see all white people as the characters we are presented as in films all the terrorists rapists midwestern nerd housewives financiers CEOs trailertrash etc etc etc.  Why do some of you assume we think ALL blacks are as presented in films such as Baby Boy?  We don't.  Period.In fact I could relate to the issues of this film's men AND women.  So this script was universal in that way too.  Anyway here's all what I really wanted to say about this film  All these emotional issues were brought to life by EXCELLENT performances.  I say Ving Rhames is one of our best actors working in America today.  He is consistently excellent I never see him acting I always only see him being his character.  And his performance here in Baby Boy was Oscarworthy if you ask me. I had no idea until the ending credits that Baby Boy was written and directed by John Singleton.  Honestly while watching it on cable I was convinced that it must have been written by a woman because it so perfectly expressed such poignant emotional moments.  Of course the actors  and Singleton as director  can also share credit for those moments.  Also while watching I had the thought that this is welldirected who did this?  I guess my point here is and this comment may annoy some Users here that Baby Boy offers proof of Singleton's talents as one of those very good filmmakers who actually DESERVES the accolades critics and industry people give him.  Although I never saw Higher Learning which Users here say stunk.  Anyway not the BEST film ever but a solid 3 out of 4 stars. Okay one more word about the acting in this flick  I'm an actor myself and many of the performances here made me LOVE acting... there were nice meaty scenes and speeches here and always so well done that it made me proud to be an actor.  Especially one monologue by Mr Rhames  phenomenal Sir!.  Bravo to all this cast.  Perhaps the best overall thing I can say about Baby Boy is that it left me wanting to see it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really really hate this movie. I bought it based on my love for John Singleton's past films like Boyz N The Hood Rosewood and Higher Learning. These were great films that I felt had thought put into them plus had a social commentary that was valid at the time of these films releases. Baby Boy not only lacks a conscious it also lacks the realism that John Singleton's earlier movies had. I could say that I don't know why John Singleton made this film but I understand all too well. When John Singleton made Higher Learningit received vitriolic reviews from pseudointellectual charlatans that label every film that dealt with issues race as propaganda. The rest of the masses just slepton it or allowed clownish socalled hip hop ragazines like Jive...oops I meant Vibe magazine to persuade their opinions. So I understand why he would make brainless MTVstyle fodder like 2 Fast 2 Furious Shaft and Baby Boy. I believe he would have still made movies of substance like Higher Learning if Higher Learning was universally acceptedwith all its flaws and not universally panned.The whole story of the film revolves around JodyTyrese Gibson and his problems in his life revolving his mother's new boyfriend MelvinVing Rhames His baby mother YvetteTaraji P. Henson and his day to day struggle around making ends meet with his partner SweetpeaOmar Gooding. Tyrese does a decent job as Jody but the character is flat out despicable. Now lets look at the characters of the main people in this film.Tyrese as Jody Irresponsible idiot that cheats on his woman and has another baby mother by the name of PeanutTamara Leseon Bass. He still lives with his mother and seems to think that is cool for a man his age to do that. He cheats on his woman and treats her like dirt. He is basically the sick caricature that Follywood promotes as the true definition of black manhood.A.J. Johnson as Juanita A mother that dresses like a Malibu hooker and tries to look cool at her age. She never pushes Jody to do anything with his life and gets into a relationship with a convict that grows weed in her garden and has no job.Taraji P Henson as Yvette a very naive young woman that sense that Jody is cheating on her and still sticks with him. She is given to fits of rage for the most simplest things and never talks to Jody with respect period.Ving Rhames as Melvin Stupid and psychotic former criminal that brags about his past misdeeds as if that was cool. He grows weed in his girlfriend's backyard and allows Jody to take the blame. He mumbles nonsense about bread and butter and has the nerve to wonder why Jody doesn't like him to date his mother. Hell I would have let Hannibal Lecter date my mother over this fool any day! Omar Gooding as Sweatpea A numbskull that curses out the same girlfriend and her mother that allowed his stupid a to stay with them when he had no place to go. He has no conscious and seems to do things out of impulse not logic.Now tell me are these the people you want to spend two hours of your life with? Tyrese and Snoop Dogg were the most convincing of characters in this movie. and to say that Cuba Gooding Jr's cousin cant act is the least of his problems. Its not like Ving Rhames A.J. Johnson Taraji P Henson cant act but their characters are underdeveloped and poorly written Shouting and arguments turn into sexual situations and the most asinine scene in the movie has to be when Jody backhands Yvette after she punched him. He takes her to the room and proceeds to give her funnylinguis. WTF? That scene is still a headscratcher till this day. I'll admit that I laughed at the scene where Jody and Sweetpea beat the hell out of a bunch of teenage punks that jumped Jody earlier but the laughter turned to disgust as soon as Sweetpea pulls out his belt and starts whipping the final victim for showing no fear.Closing comments Baby Boy is a mess and will set black cinema back a couple of years. Nobody with a conscious exist in Baby Boy. Nobody of sound Mind exists in Baby Boy. Boyz N The hood has FuriousLaurence Fisburne to add insight to that film. Where is his equivalent in Baby Boy? Nowhere to be found. No insight went into this film. Just a bunch of despicable and ignorant caricatures . If you want see better movies from John Singleton see his earlier works like the movies I mentioned earlier in this review and forget that this overtly preachy joke exists if you can.".

The film looks at this character but also the forces that sort of make him into what he is.  It is a really good character portrait that also has some really fired up performances from Ving Rhames as a new excon boyfriend of his mother A.J. Johnson as the mother Omar Gooding Gooding Jr.'s brother as Jody's good friend especially Taraji P.

It's a delight from the streak of not that good movies out now and it should be able to appeal to both black and white audiences.  Definately reccomended.  A".

Before I seen the film I wasn't expecting Tyrese Gibson to be that good because the late great Tupac Shakur was suppose to play the role of Jody but I was astounded at how good Tyrese is at acting. This also has to be the best film Snoop Dogg has starred in because some of his earlier efforts e.g. Urban Menace are just pitiful.

Ditto for women.The language here is absolutely disgusting to say the least. You can't get through a sentence without b and f bombs being hurled at each other.How old is Tyrese Gibson's mom in this film? She must have had him when she was 14 or so.How horrible that the killing is never solved by police officials.These negative things being said our sociologists would view this film positively claiming that it gives an adequate description of black life.Where are our so called black activists in protesting this film? I thought I was back in the New York City classroom or other large urban school setting. What a disgusting film to show to all groups. Talk of reviving of racial prejudice this was really off the wall.";

Or is it that you become a man by killing another man?  Real good role model for young black men.  This movie had some good acting and realistic dialogue but the story line was bad.  It's supposed to be a coming of age film but you start with a loser that lives with his mother and end with a loser who is mooching off of one of his TWO baby's mammas.  How did that term even become a real way to refer to relationships in black culture? That's a sad statement in and of itself. John Singleton should be using his influence to show stories of men who got OUT of the hood and became contributing members of society.  Someone tell John Singleton that selling stolen clothes is not a real job and killing a man doesn't make you a man. 'Boys in the Hood' was a far better movie!".

John Singleton is certainly a competent director as he has proven with Boyz In the Hood and well Boyz in the Hood. The Actors were all good to Above average. Especially Ving Rames and surprisingly Tyrese. The film was well lit and in focus. Technically the production was sound. The actual Content of the film was very disappointing at best  disgustingly condescending at worst. The main character is a very unlikable 20ish lazy obnoxious jerk. His friends and family are not any better. His mother tries and often comes close to being an actual honesttogoodness responsible Adult Person yet ultimately falls short. Rames has the most interesting character Too bad the movie was not about him a hardboiled yet childish and irresponsible as a father figure. Believe it or not each character portrays the negative stereotypes that racists have been spouting on about for decades. Why Singleton chose to portray all of these AfricanAmericans in the 'hood as dim shallow dishonest foulmouthed materialistic sexually amoral and completely irresponsible is beyond me. They are nothing like the wide variety of reallife AfricanAmericans that populate my world. There are many scenes in this film that I could only imagine would make the KKK proud. Why indeed! And by the way when a criminal moves into your home uninvitedCALL THE POLICE!! A sad commentary on the state of the depiction of AfricanAmericans in film. If John Singleton is willing to depict his community this waythen what will mainstream Hollywood sink to in the future? My heart goes out to those who bother to care.".

Basically the movie's message was about the main character to get off his lazy a and take care of his responsibilites.  None of these characters in this movie would be someone I'd like to know and I don't who was worse in this movie  the black males or the black females.  On the plus side Tyrese proves that he can act.  Too bad he does it in the wrong film.  In closing I think it would have been better if Singleton did a sequel to Boyz N the Hood that takes places 10 years after the original with Cuba Gooding Jr.Note Cuba's brother Omar is in this film Nia Long and Laurence Fishburne returning rather than making this movie.My final 2 cents Boyz N the Hood it ain't Baby Boy has got to the worst film ever made by John Singleton.My rating 1 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Singleton's solid direction didn't save the uneven pacing of this film  and not only the pacing there's a lot of Gap that occurred here i don't know what it is exactly but probably the lack of resolution and the absence of consequences that suppose to be given to some of the lead characters i don't know maybe its just me. The story opens with a fresh sequence on the definition of why a black male is defined as a baby boy we are then introduced with the title character  Jody  A 20 yr old unachieving young man trying to break free off the directionless life on the street but seems to do little about itinstead he prefers the good old in and out and sampling other local females despite already giving babies to his steady girlfriend and another mistress type of womanoh yes he also lives with his young mom who still samples on different type of thug boyfriends that is until the biggest thugMelvin aka Ving Rhames came by  took the heart of mom and leave Jody with Oedipus angst now i leave it to here since it is really hard to break down a summary for this one every scenes seems to be working like a mini episodes of themselves which is also the weakness of this film.It really had potential to be a classic movie but you're never really sure whether it is meant to be a comedy drama or a thriller as all of these aspects are thrown in there but it often leaves you wondering what is going on. Ving's character had potential to be a real strong powerful character that you could learn lessons from etc and to an extent he is however it is undermined by the regular and frequent comedic turns he is asked to perform throughout the movie. Don't get me wrong they are funny but like i said the film's issues in my opinion are too serious to warrant it. The main character Jodie is not likable and i feel he is supposed to be a bit of an antihero type but he simply doesn't come across like that due to partly not great acting and bad writing. That sadly is the case for the whole movie Henson's acting is superb as always but the script is corny and clich'd. Sometimes it works some times it doesn't. I'm a fan of hip hop and hood movies too and this is still probably one of the better ones. Even though i've pointed out the bad points i would still watch this again sometimes for the moments that are memorable.Overall rating 6 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Psychological Horror at its very best";
	schema:reviewBody "One might argue Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film since it lacks almost everything you'll find in almost all of them shock moments vampires werewolf serial killers even blood. The most graphic scene is a nightmare sequence that displays a rape scene so stylized it isn't actually disturbing. But one might also argue that Rosemary's Baby is a horror film in its purest form since it doesn't depend on all those gimmicks to create its atmosphere. I prefer the latter point of view. So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly there is something strange about them  the sounds that come from their apartment the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbors and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant  she recommends her another better as she says gynecologist's and mixes a healthy as she says herbal drink for her every day. The pregnancy however develops rather unpleasant Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner Pregnant women are supposed to gain not lose weight a visiting friend observes and when the pain doesn't stop after several months she begins to believe that her neighbors her gynecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying. All this is told by Roman Polanski in the perfect tone the mood for the entire film is already set during the opening credits when we hear that weird lullaby sung by Mia Farrow. And a lot of strange things happen throughout the entire film Guy and Rosemary are told by Hutch a friend of theirs about the horrific past of the house they're now living in a young girl that lives with the Castevets commits suicide really a suicide? Guy an actor gets the role he wanted so badly after the contestant who was originally supposed to play it turns blind and Hutch who might have found something out that would help Rosemary suddenly is in a coma and dies three months later all these and a few other events are precisely dosed by Polanski to draw us more and more into the film while he makes sure on the other hand that the film doesn't become absurd. And he manages to give the film an ending that works makes sense and is observant slightly but only slightly funny and very disturbing all at once.

	onyx:emotionText "One might argue Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film since it lacks almost everything you'll find in almost all of them shock moments vampires werewolf serial killers even blood. The most graphic scene is a nightmare sequence that displays a rape scene so stylized it isn't actually disturbing. But one might also argue that Rosemary's Baby is a horror film in its purest form since it doesn't depend on all those gimmicks to create its atmosphere. I prefer the latter point of view. So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly there is something strange about them  the sounds that come from their apartment the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbors and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant  she recommends her another better as she says gynecologist's and mixes a healthy as she says herbal drink for her every day. The pregnancy however develops rather unpleasant Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner Pregnant women are supposed to gain not lose weight a visiting friend observes and when the pain doesn't stop after several months she begins to believe that her neighbors her gynecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying. All this is told by Roman Polanski in the perfect tone the mood for the entire film is already set during the opening credits when we hear that weird lullaby sung by Mia Farrow. And a lot of strange things happen throughout the entire film Guy and Rosemary are told by Hutch a friend of theirs about the horrific past of the house they're now living in a young girl that lives with the Castevets commits suicide really a suicide? Guy an actor gets the role he wanted so badly after the contestant who was originally supposed to play it turns blind and Hutch who might have found something out that would help Rosemary suddenly is in a coma and dies three months later all these and a few other events are precisely dosed by Polanski to draw us more and more into the film while he makes sure on the other hand that the film doesn't become absurd. And he manages to give the film an ending that works makes sense and is observant slightly but only slightly funny and very disturbing all at once. Rosemary's Baby also contains two of the most memorable performances ever Mia Farrow is haunting as Rosemary Woodhouse. She looks like she is physically suffering from her pregnancy and close to complete despair. And Ruth Gordon is amazing as the curious Minnie Castevet always friendly but also giving you the feeling that hidden behind her generosity she actually follows her own obscure motives. If you have a helpful elderly female neighbor you'll see her with other eyes once you've encountered Minnie Castevet.

The Dakota located at 72nd and Central Park West is the perfect setting for the demonic events all that rich Gothic detail in the heart of Manhattan provides the perfect atmosphere serving as a dark fairytale world of its own within the modern setting. Roman Polanski knows this and utilizes it brilliantly opening the film with stunning aerial shots of the skyline and focusing in on the ornate castle amongst the skyscrapers and tenements.The acting is fantastic particularly Mia Farrow who is the only person I can envision as Rosemary. Her fineboned fragility makes her the ideal target for terror. She goes from obliviousness to suspicion to fear to near madness without showing a seam and we as the audience are with her all the way. And Mia is given a run for her money by the delightful Ruth Gordon a comical yet sinister presence popping in on a deliberate schedule with pale green drinks and sandpapery advice. She's scary because we know hera batty old broad with a seemingly sweet nature beneath her caustic surface. That such a person could possibly be a vessel of evil is a thoroughly unnerving concept.Unnerving is the proper adjective for the entire movie. Unnerving eerie and penetratingly frightening in a very subtle manner. The subtlety is key since a more explicit treatment would've spoiled everything. As the tension heightens we feel what Rosemary feels Curiosity then vague suspicion then paralyzing terror at the final revelation. At all times the movie retains its dignity from the opening and closing shots of the building to the flourishing title script to the beautiful music. Even on TV this picture can chill you to the bone. The best bigbudget horror movie of all time.".

I think that perfection is in the brain and heart of the beholder. Rosemary's baby is a perfect film to me. Scary in a way that makes you breathless. You're thinking and feeling throughout the film. One of the many sides of Polanski's genius is to suggest. And what he suggest is so monstrous that we don't want to believe it but we do. The characters are so perfectly drawn that there is no cheating involved. John Cassavettes's superb study in selfishness and egomaniacal frustration is so real that comes to no surprise that he could do what he does to advance his career but we are surprised we're horrified. The spectacular Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer are not Deborah Kerr and David Niven are they? So that they turn out to be what they turn out to be is totally believable but Polanski presents it in such a light of normality that you can't believe it. Mia Farrow's predicament is as classic as the boy who cried wolf tale and yet as told by Roman Polanski in the wonderful face of Mia Farrow is as if we're hearing it seeing it and living it for the first time. Every silence every voice in the distance every door opening. Your heart is always in your throat. There is something there that accelerates a constant state of dread. Very few movies have been able to take me to that place most of them by Roman Polanski what about The Tenant or Repulsion? Other movies that come to mind David Lynch's Eraserhead and Martin Donovan's Apartment Zero But Rosemary's baby stands alone as a terrifying masterpiece.".

Young idealistic Rosemary Mia Farrow and new hubby Guy John Cassavetes move into a Manhattan apartment building called the Bramford. Throughout most of the film we as viewers see and hear what innocent Rosemary sees and hears. There's a veneer of normalcy at the Bramford that belies what's really going on behind our backs. It's the script's POV therefore that makes this film so chilling.At the Bramford which has quite a colorful history you can hear through the walls. And as Rosemary and we viewers soon find out strange people lurk in other parts of the building. The strangest of all are Roman and Minnie Castevet Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon superficially cordial but a bit too inquisitive. Roman is retired. His wife Minnie wears tons of makeup and pawnshop jewelry and gushes with praise for herbal cures especially something called tannisroot. And Minnie's friend LauraLouise Patsy Kelly wears thick glasses that make her eyes seem to bulge and she talks with a strangely deep voice.Rosemary's Baby is one of the great thrillers of all time. Given the underlying subject matter can you imagine how this film must have come across to viewers in 1968? The strength of the film is the script which through its plot and dialogue implies and suggests. Not until near the end do we like Rosemary find out the presumed truth. Suspense increases toward the end as Rosemary ventures into the inner sanctum of the Bramford.The film's acting is great and reinforces the strong script. I particularly liked Ruth Gordon with her delightfully eccentric behavior and mannerisms. Production design and especially costumes are lavish and colorful. Clothes and hairstyles as you would expect are very 1960ish. Visual effects are minimal and are used to enhance the story not be the story.Given the film's POV the story is rather subjective. Its interpretation is based on Rosemary's perceptions images and fears. One could explain that Rosemary suffers from delusions. Or alternately one could explain that what happens is real. It's all in the interpretation. Either way it's a great movie. It holds up well forty years later a tribute to its writer and director Roman Polanski.".

Things start slow  one beat so to speak to a bar  and gradually pick up speed so that by the end we are nervously tapping out semiquavers with our feet.  Polanski also understands the gentle art of hintdropping.  Many events are filed away as tiny puzzles to be solved later and they ARE solved later others we don't attach any particular significance to at the time Polanski invites us to reinterpret in retrospect AND chooses the right moment to let us do so.  And then at the end AFTER we've worked everything out he presents us with a surprise  a delightful gratuitous twist which nothing had prepared us for which we couldn't have guessed yet which doesn't cancel out the story as we'd understood it.  Alas many people know what this surprise is in advance. I for one.  Yet this foreknowledge did nothing to spoil my enjoyment a sure sign of superb construction.All in all a film that tempts you to rank it with the best ever made  which is more but not much more than it deserves  simply because it's perfect.  Everything went right.  Rosemary is a wonderfully sympathetic heroine powerless without being passive largely ignorant of what's going on around her without being at all stupid and Mia Farrow makes you care deeply about her.  The cinematography is pellucid the art direction is subtly right there's also a fine odd yet tuneful musical score.  I can't believe I waited so long to see this.".

Polanski creates a gloomy isolated and chilling mood. 'Rosemary's Baby' is a horror film but unlike most movies of this genre this one is very subtle and is more dependent on the atmosphere rather than the 'horror creatures'. It is only in the excellently executed nightmare sequence which is comprised of fragments of scenes that one witnesses something 'out of the ordinary'. I was initially dissatisfied by the ending but after some thought I couldn't think of a better more effective conclusion. The ending itself is so spinechilling and makes the movie experience more horrifying. The haunting lullaby replays in the end capturing that moment of horror like a photographic memory. The cast does a fine job though clearly this is Farrow's film. Mia Farrow is spellbinding. The way she captures Rosemary's kindness agony anguish fragility and courage is noteworthy. She is simply amazing to watch. I can understand why it is still so popular after 40 years. There has been hardly anything else like it.".

	schema:headline " The Horror Underneath a Pregnant Woman's Belly.";
	schema:reviewBody "Pregnancy is the time in a woman's life that despite the hormone imbalance and the emotional changes is charged in an overwhelming among of love and support and the notion that she is slowly gestating a human life male or female a child that will bring her and her family happiness. Motherhood has been depicted as beautiful symbolic Woman being Creation in progress in ancient cultures a Thing to venerate and respect and even worship Something capable of ensuring the continuation of a family line a tradition and hence life and culture for an entire strata of society. Nothing is supposed to go wrong or at least not at the level of what happens to Rosemary Woodhouse's pregnancy which is the ultimate wrong thing.What Ira Levin seems to want to tell us in this plot surrounding Rosemary's pregnancy is that society and its religious tradition can be substituted by something much more sinister asyet unseen but gestant  the force of will the creation of Man's own version of what he believes will be the new wave of humanity. Is God dead? Well considering the timing of the novel and the movie with society's disillusionment with Establishment the onset of Vietnam the loss of innocence of a country just years ago with the deaths of John F. Kennedy Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King He just as well may be. Religion and religious figures pop up during the movie but seem unable to bring any comfort and only add to the vague sense of unease that permeates ROSEMARY'S BABY.And this nagging unease is precisely what both author and director give us something not quite completely there something that seems to be happening just offlimits barely overheard through the flimsy walls which divide these prewar apartment buildings converted into chic livable spaces. The way the banal elements that are so much a part of our lives are overthrown so subtly makes the horror that is the movie's denouement even more tragic. Surely the nice neighbors can't be more than just that  they're so helpful... well maybe a little too helpful. Surely the death of that girl Rosemary befriends was just a freak suicide. Surely the doctor's recommendations for Rosemary are the best  don't doctor's always know what's good for us? And surely one's own partner would not have done the unthinkable in order to advance professionally now would he?Paranoia of the unseen is a powerful way to tell a horror story without ever giving away any shock cuts or showing the boogeyman. While it becomes abundantly clear early on that this is a story of witchcraft of the worst kind the only time some of it makes its way in front of the camera is in the extremely stylized ritualrape scene and even then since Rosemary is having what might be the worst nightmare of her life one isn't quite sure of what is happening and of course in the end when all is revealed in a comic yet horrific way.

	onyx:emotionText "Pregnancy is the time in a woman's life that despite the hormone imbalance and the emotional changes is charged in an overwhelming among of love and support and the notion that she is slowly gestating a human life male or female a child that will bring her and her family happiness. Motherhood has been depicted as beautiful symbolic Woman being Creation in progress in ancient cultures a Thing to venerate and respect and even worship Something capable of ensuring the continuation of a family line a tradition and hence life and culture for an entire strata of society. Nothing is supposed to go wrong or at least not at the level of what happens to Rosemary Woodhouse's pregnancy which is the ultimate wrong thing.What Ira Levin seems to want to tell us in this plot surrounding Rosemary's pregnancy is that society and its religious tradition can be substituted by something much more sinister asyet unseen but gestant  the force of will the creation of Man's own version of what he believes will be the new wave of humanity. Is God dead? Well considering the timing of the novel and the movie with society's disillusionment with Establishment the onset of Vietnam the loss of innocence of a country just years ago with the deaths of John F. Kennedy Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King He just as well may be. Religion and religious figures pop up during the movie but seem unable to bring any comfort and only add to the vague sense of unease that permeates ROSEMARY'S BABY.And this nagging unease is precisely what both author and director give us something not quite completely there something that seems to be happening just offlimits barely overheard through the flimsy walls which divide these prewar apartment buildings converted into chic livable spaces. The way the banal elements that are so much a part of our lives are overthrown so subtly makes the horror that is the movie's denouement even more tragic. Surely the nice neighbors can't be more than just that  they're so helpful... well maybe a little too helpful. Surely the death of that girl Rosemary befriends was just a freak suicide. Surely the doctor's recommendations for Rosemary are the best  don't doctor's always know what's good for us? And surely one's own partner would not have done the unthinkable in order to advance professionally now would he?Paranoia of the unseen is a powerful way to tell a horror story without ever giving away any shock cuts or showing the boogeyman. While it becomes abundantly clear early on that this is a story of witchcraft of the worst kind the only time some of it makes its way in front of the camera is in the extremely stylized ritualrape scene and even then since Rosemary is having what might be the worst nightmare of her life one isn't quite sure of what is happening and of course in the end when all is revealed in a comic yet horrific way. That takes skill in a storyteller and what makes ROSEMARY'S BABY so completely disturbing even now almost forty years from its release unto the public. Also the fact that it never relies on a twist ending so common today but on the nuanced performance of the actors portraying real urbanites enhances from Mia Farrow who carries the movie and even at the end retains a resigned innocence to her fate once her suspicions are facts to John Cassavettes who plays his part slimy straight and supporting actors Ruth Gordon and Sydney Blackmer who have the hard task of making kindly and eccentric hide sinister just underneath.

This isn't the shallow gimmicky kind of horror movie we mostly get these days and it isn't the traditional oldfashioned horror film of an earlier era.  This is a movie that came out during a period of transition in Hollywood.  The old production codes were breaking down and films could suddenly be more true to life in the way they showed how people really lived acted and talked.  1968s Rosemary's Baby is a more sophisticated less elegant thriller of the kind that Alfred Hitchcock patented but it displays much more class and intelligence than the horror movies that would come out in its wake.  Popular '70s films such as The Exorcist and The Omen are the prodigy of Rosemary's Baby but offer far less nuance and much greater vulgarity.  What we get here is a more naturalistic depiction of modern life but without the crassness that would soon explode into American cinema.  Most of the credit for what makes Rosemary's Baby such a successful film goes to Roman Polanski.  Polanski is a master at conveying to an audience not just a sense of the uncanny but a vivid depiction of it.  His earlier films like Knife in the Water Repulsion and Dance of the Vampires display the talents that would come to such a controlled mastery in Rosemary's Baby.Polanski very faithfully adapts Ira Levin's novel to the screen so that the viewer is just as the reader was free to interpret the eerie events of the story as either reality or a depiction of an isolated woman's decent into madness.  At the same time the picture can be taken as a black joke on the human male's fears of the changes a woman goes through during pregnancy both physically and emotionally.  But Polanski seems most interested in presenting a normal world in this case Manhattan in the mid 1960s and then through subtle cinematic techniques get an audience to actually believe that the hysterical fantastic ravings of the heroine could be true.  It is this tour de force exercise in suspension of disbelief that makes the film a classic.  The horror films that have come since have had to ratchet up the shock effects in order to thrill more desensitized audiences but this deliberately paced film reminds us of how much better it is to leave things to the imagination of the viewer.  That is where films really come alive and remain so.The Paramount DVD presents an excellent print of the movie that looks as if it were shot yesterday along with extras that include new interviews with Polanski executive producer Bob Evans and production designer Richard Sylbert and a featurette from the time of the film's original release that really works as a good time capsule.".

	schema:headline " Awful things happen in every apartment house";
	schema:reviewBody "Rosemary's Baby was originally proposed as a project to Alfred Hitchcock. He turned it down and instead it fell to the upandcoming Polish director Roman Polanski. It's hard to imagine what the master of suspense would have made out of this tale of devil worship and Catholic guilt even though there is some Hitchockian psychology and mystery at work. As it was however it proved to be right up the young Polanski's street taking his career to new heights and spawning a run of occult horrors in the late 60s and early 70s of which this is still one of the few greats.Polanski had already established himself as a director most comfortable with the confinement of interiors in films like Repulsion 1965. Here he draws us right into the claustrophobic feel of the upstairs apartment often placing the camera in a room adjacent to the action with the characters viewed through a doorway. The camera movement is mostly restricted to pans. It rarely tracks or dollys as if it were trapped in a corner. Even in the exterior scenes the sky is often sandwiched or blotted out altogether between the buildings rising on either side. The actors often appear uncomfortably close to the camera but not in individual closeup shots. Instead they come in that close as they move around the set and the camera pans back and forth. Not only does this add to the cramped awkward atmosphere but this constantly changing distancing of actors within a single shots makes the audience feel as if they are actually standing there.Rosemary's Baby may come across as very slow to some viewers. 140 minutes certainly is a long time in the horror genre. There do also appear to be a lot of unnecessary details in the dialogue  we get to find out far more about Rosemary's background than is normal for a character in cinema. But for one thing Polanski was not interested in making a shockandgore horror  Rosemary's Baby is all about the eerie atmosphere the tension and the mystery. He holds our attention by regularly dropping in clues that something sinister is afoot. Furthermore all the detail and depth has its significance in the finished product  like the references to Rosemary's Catholic upbringing or the background of the Castavets.Polanski has never overused flashy techniques  no fast editing zooms or unusual angles that make for a very obvious directorial style. But there is always great complexity and meaning in the look of things  the set design lighting costume and so on. One of my favourite touches is Mia Farrow's extremely short Vidal Sassoon hairdo that she has done halfway through the film. With her bony features and pale skin she more and more begins to resemble a skeleton especially under the carefully placed lighting in the scene after the party when she realises the pain has gone. It's simple yet significant ideas like that which make Polanski one of the best directors of his era.There's some great casting in this picture. Careful choice of character actors makes for some quirky supporting roles. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes are perfect in the lead roles. The musical score  that haunting opening melody or the atonal violin squeaks  all add to the atmosphere.Rosemary's Baby is a real landmark in horror. It helped keep the genre alive by pushing the occult  something fairly taboo and not fully explored in cinema since the days of silents  to the fore. Also the restrained atmospheric horror was doubtless influential particularly on Kubrick when he came to make The Shining. It inspired a lot but was rarely bettered.".

But all of these things are at nothing compared to the real horror in Rosemary's life that she is nothing more then a gestation vessel for her ambitious husband the gory eccentrics in her building and the most powerful demon in the Christian pantheon. No one takes her seriously in any other capacity. Even at the end her last bit of resistance is broken down as Roman Castavet eases her into the role of the mother of destruction.I don't think it's any coincidence that Ira Levin wrote this novel or that it became such a huge hit in the sixties when birth control pills became household words and the first open battles for legal abortion were being waged and won. The strength of this film is that it deals with social issues reproductive rights that were actively bouncing between the ears of the greater population of this country and yet still doesn't become a tedious piece of social realism or agitprop. The cast of the film is remarkable. Mia Farrow plays a woman protagonist who is far more self identified then the usual female victim in a Gothic Guy Cassevetes plays a treacherous husband whose actions are beneath contempt both performances are very precise. The film bounces adroitly from the high camp of Elija Cook's fastidious building superintendent to the great white fatherliness seen in Maurice Evan's character Hutch. The use of Ruth Gordon is inspired having Sidney Blackmer play straight man to her zaniness even more so. The very fine comedienne Patsy Kelly shows up as a more obstreporous member of the coven Ralph Bellamy is sedate and subdued as the suave warlock Sapperstein. And somehow or other director Roman Polanski managed to tie all these energies together and create a solid consistent package with a subdued pace that is both hysterical and chilling at the same time. It is one powerful satire.Finally the film contains one very strong nightmare sequence. Dreams are scary Neil Gaiman reminds usbut there are few portrayed on film as strikingly as the one Rosemary has under a drug induced slumber on the night of her demonic group rape and the child's conception.Rosemary's Baby is a magnificent effort. And I believe it set a standard that every new horror film should be measured against just as the film 2001 has become for many admirers of science fiction one of the benchmarks of that genre.".

Not since Delilah took to Samson's barnet has a haircut signalled such a decline. It's at that moment that Rosemary's slump into madness begins.

In an age when most directors seem to confuse gallons of stage blood and severed body parts with scariness it's refreshing to be reminded that the most frightening movies need not resort to the grand guignol technique.

The beginning kind of drags you can tell this lovely couple's new neighbors are kind of off but I chalked it up to weird old people doing what they do best... making people uncomfortable. Throughout the movie you watch as the couple tries for a baby conceives goes through the pregnancy which is no easy task for this poor soontobe mom and finally the birth and disappearance of that child.

	schema:reviewBody "Rosemary's Baby centers on Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse Mia Farrow and John Cassavettes a young happy couple who move into a New York City apartment building to start their life together. They are greeted by their elderly neighbors Minnie and Roman Castevet Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer an eccentric and friendly couple who are helpful but a bit intrusive. Rosemary and Guy plan on having a baby together but the conception is strange and seems to have happened while Rosemary was dreaming. All the while Minnie and Roman seem to form an unusual relationship with Guy and begin to take over all the duties and events revolving around Rosemary's pregnancy  things that should be up to the mother. Meanwhile Rosemary begins to lose weight is constantly ill and has odd pains in her stomach  things that aren't normal in a healthy pregnancy. After a series of strange events Rosemary soon becomes convinced that Minnie and Roman are part of a Satantic cult and that they have made some sort of exchange with Guy... a horrific exchange that involves Rosemary and her baby.Maybe one of the greatest stories of betrayal to grace the silver screen this adaptation from Levin's phenomenal novel is done neatly and the transfer to the screen is brilliant. The film like the book takes its time but the slowgoing nature gives plenty of room for formidable suspense and atmosphere.One of the scariest things about Rosemary's Baby is its affect on the viewer. The paranoia fear claustrophobia and foreboding that Rosemary feels channels directly to the audience and you by proxy experience what she's experiencing. The first fortyfive minutes or so seem fairly conventional but after that the film goes into a straight downward spiral into madness and by God do you feel it. There's a consistent sense of something not being quite right mainly with the neighbors whose motives are questionable behind their friendly facade and this feeling never dissipates. Within the element of the betrayal are the layers of subjects that make it a horror film the Satanic society the occult strange rituals the Antichrist and the overall demonic subtext. It's all quite terrifying and the contents of the plot are all sinister subjects. The film looks amazing as if it could have been shot just last week. Nice camerawork that is subtle and neat but shaky and effective when needed. The settings are all truly spooky and the Dakota is is photographed to its full Gothic effect.Mia Farrow stars in the performance of her career as the young naive Rosemary. All she wants is the ideal life with her husband and child but she is swept into something more terrifying than she could ever imagine. Farrow plays the part precisely and gains plenty of sympathy from the audience. Ruth Gordon won an Oscar for her portrayal of the Woodhouse's nosy neighbor Minnie. She's friendly and inquisitive but we know from the start that she has ulterior motives as well as her husband. John Cassavettes plays Guy excellently and Sidney Blackmer is great as well as Minnie's odd husband. As for the ending it's a shocker and probably the most memorable thing about the entire movie. It's something that will stick with you and that you can't easily shake but is ambiguous enough to keep you asking questions.Overall Rosemary's Baby is a throughandthrough classic. While it isn't 'scary' by conventional means it manages to maintain a subtle foreboding atmosphere unnerving the audience to the point of paranoia. The performances are topnotch and the subject matter is as shuddering as the Castevet's dark evil intrusion into Rosemary's life. You'll spend an uncomfortable but spellbinding two hours on the edge of your seat. Isn't that what a good horror movie should do? 1010.".

On each of these points as well as any other you care to mention 'Rosemary's Baby' easily qualifies.Having established himself as an upandcoming European director in the 1960s with the likes of his debut 'Knife in the Water' 1962 Roman Polanski was brought to America to direct this horror movie about a secret society of Devil worshippers composed of wealthy and distinguished citizens manipulating a young woman into giving birth to the child of Satan in late60's New York. The film is the second part of Polanski's socalled apartment trilogy the other parts being 'Repulsion 1965' and 'The Tenant' 1976 and as such begins with a shot of the Bramford apartment building in reality the Dakota building which would later be the building John Lennon was shot in front of which struggling actor Guy Woodhouse Cassavetes and his beautiful young wife Rosemary Farrow manage to bag a sizable apartment in. Despite being regaled with macabre stories of the history of the Black Bramford from their previous landlordpaternal figure Edward Hutch Hutchins the couple move in to begin their new life and soon strike up a relationship with an elderly couple Minnie Gordan and Roman Castevet Blackmer after a young drug addict in their care kills herself. Not long after and with the help of a dizzying dreamnightmare sequence which is far more authentic than the famed Dali sequence in Hitchcock's 'Spellbound' Rosemary becomes pregnantbut her jubilation is shortlived and soon transforms into a disturbing paranoid nightmare.For a horror film it is refreshingly free of gore or ridiculous jumpmoments and instead slowly chills the viewer through an atmosphere which becomes increasingly unnerving and claustrophobic as Rosemary discovers various clues which suggest that the Castevets may be involved in the darkest of dealings and may have lured Guy into their ranks. However the film perfectly walks the line between suggesting an actual conspiracy supernatural or otherwise and a hysterical paranoid fantasy on Rosemary's part which is surely a testament to the fine performances of every one of the cast. A particular joy of the film are the countless Oh yeah moments you get from corroborating upon repeat viewings observations made by Rosemary like the mismatched paintings on the walls of the Castevets' apartment when they first visit or that Guy is still wearing his makeup when he returns home unexpectedly early to disrupt Hutch's visit all of which contribute to Rosemary suspecting that something is afoot. These subtle psychological ploys unsettle the viewer as they suggest things which we are prone to miss despite being in plain sight and effectively conjures an atmosphere rooted in the familiar but where disturbing figures may be watching from the periphery.A year later Polanki's wife Sharon Tate would star in the role which would earn her popculture immortality a butchered victim of Charles Manson's family. As such with its explicit occult themes although Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey's involvement as a consultant and the figure of the Devil in the dream sequence has been shown to be false and its exultant subversion of Nietzsche's God is Dead! the film could be seen as an eerie prophecy of the darker vein inherent in the flowerpower ideology which ended so abruptly with the TateLaBianca slayingsand the postscript of which would be with Lennon's murder outside the BramfoDakota building. Polanski himself would go on to secure his Hollywood AList status with 'Chinatown' 1974 and 'The Pianist' 2002 but how can one's career improve upon a movie genuinely worthy of 1010?".

Rosemary' Baby has to do with the most darkest fears one can conjure up in a movie book as well as in one's own mind The return of Satanthe Devilon earth and everything that goes along with him.It's early October 1965 and the Pope Pope Paul VI has made a historical visit to the US and is in the process of giving a sermon to some 60000 people at New York's Yankee Stadium. It's also the time designated by a coven of Devil worshiping witches for the Devil's offspring to be named Adrian to be conceived by the unsuspecting and Catholic observant Rosemary Woodhouse Mia Farrow.Since Rosemary and her actor husband Guy John Cassavetes moved into the creepy Bramford Building they've become very friendly with the elderly couple who lives next door to their apartment Roman and Minnie Castevet Sidney Blackman  Ruth Roman. Even though Rosemary is not that taken in by the Castevets eccentric and somewhat wired behaviors her husband Guy is. Guy a struggling actor was desperately trying to get a part in a play that the far more talented Donald Baumgart Tony Curtis got. After Guy's involvement with the Castevets Baumgart suddenly lost his sight opening the door for another actor to replace him Guy Woodhouse!The movie starts to grow and accelerate together with Rosemary's pregnancy in both tension as well as curiosity as she becomes very frail and sickly as the day of the blessed event June 28 1966 is soon to arrive. Feeling that something just isn't right Rosmary has been haunted since her night of conception October 56 1965 it that she feels that it's wasn't Guy who fathered her now soon to be born child but the Devil or Satanplayed by Clay Tanner himself!Despite the movie's many subplots all centered around Rosemary's pregnancy and birth to her child the film is never confusing in that they the subplots all come together in the film's final and shocking ten or so minutes! The Woodhouse's at first had no idea to what evil existed right at their front doorsteps! Soon they would become in their associations with the Castevets the very central and rotten core of it!It was family friend Edward Hutch Hutchins Maurice Evens who knew not only the history of the eerie Bramford Building but that of one of its infamous tenants Steven Marcato. It was also that knowledge that lead to Hutch falling into a deep coma that he never came out of!SPOILER ALERT It was Marcato who was killed by an angry New York mob some 80 years ago for secretly practicing witchcraft! It was also Marcato who had a son who had since changed or rearranged his name and became a man of the world as well as in his many travels secretly gotten himself involved with the occult like his father did! That person is non other then the Woodhouse's kindly and harmless looking next door neighbor Roman Castevet himself!Making a pact with the Devil has its price and the price that Guy Woodhouse paid for bringing him in Guy allowing Satan to rape his wife Rosemary out of the depths of Hell and into the unsuspecting world above was more that it was worth. Guy's career in both TV and the movies as well as the theater took off like a shot but in reality he ended up damned for all eternity. As for poor Rosemany in the end after seeing what her new born son really looked like and what he represented it was both her goodness in Rosemary's Christian beliefs and maternal instincts that eventually overrode her horror and revulsion in what she was forced by her husband Guy and the Castevets to unknowingly participate in. As the movie ends Rosemary is heard humming the lullaby theme of the movie as she's gently and tenderly rocking the cute little Devil her son Adrian to sleep!".

	schema:reviewBody "A gorgeous piece of sustained suspense filmmaking. Polanski is leisurely in his pacing and camerawork with long takes and assured movement. Focusing on the environment the use of sight and sound and the performances to build the story. It's really just a perfect movie. There isn't a wasted shot nor clunky editing nor melodrama to be found.Mia Farrow is perfect as the fragile waif Rosemary and John Cassavetes does a lot with a role that is intentionally underwritten. He sells everything Guy is going through by sheer force of acting will. Ruth Gordon who won a hard to contest Oscar and Sidney Blackmer play the nosey old couple next door to sublime exactness.Not so much a horror movie as a story that contains horror elements although there are moments of terror to be found. Used sparingly and as a result effectively. Mia's rape scene with its use of hallucinogenic scenery and flashes of Satan is chilling in its implications. Rosemary's reaction to her first sight of the baby is bloodcurdling. But maybe what's most scary is the choice she makes to end the movie. These help the movie to get under your skin so much so that by the film's climax you don't realize how much stress you've been put under. The movie conveys the paranoia and lonesomeness of Rosemary without drawing attention to itself.There are plenty of themes explored here. It was 1968 at the height of women's lib and Rosemary is a dependent who has shunned both God and family to get to where she is. She has no sense of self really outside of Guy. Her haircut and then her baby become these things. Is she being punished for not being more independent? Was that her birth by fire into modern womanhood? There's paranoia and xenophobia about the people next door the people you think you know but do you? and the old ways all set within one of the most populated cities on the planet and yet a person can still feel all alone.A great movie a great story doesn't have to be about any one of those themes but it's all there for the taking. It's small pricklings of common human thinking and modern anxieties that can help fuel the subtext of a good story well told.".

Rosemary's Baby took some cues from Hitchcock's work but by its own right it revolutionized horror cinema and had a huge part in inspiring classics from Jaws to The Shining and The Thing  films that took to heart the lesson that nothing is scarier than nothing and maintain tension and terror throughout with very little actually happening.Partly thanks to the film's minimalistic nature most of it takes place in one apartment not unlike Repulsion and the refusal to rely on special effects and partly thanks to Polanski's inspired directorial work Rosemary's Baby stood the test of time better than any horror film of its time  indeed better than most films of the 60's. Young viewers more accustomed to slasher horror may scoff at how little happens but once you start watching the feeling of terror and discomfort grows and it's impossible not to be taken in especially if you've anywhere near the protagonists' age. Mya Farrow and John Cassavetes are terrific in the leads probably delivering the most powerful performances in their careers and their show is nearly stolen by the irritating charming creepy lovable Ruth Gordon who won a very deserved Oscar for her part.Very few films are as timeless as Rosemary's Baby and few are as absorbing and effective.

It does have its share of comedy  there's a lightness in tone that comes mainly from the profuse swearing of the Maritime newlywed Kerry Fox who takes part in one of the more awkward marriage processions in recent memory which also features Ashley MacIsaac on fiddle and whose marriage instigates the return of her tenyearsgone brother William. The telling of the film is centered around three tenses of William's life  his childhood memories his fat teenage years and his current appearance  which are cut up rearranged and presented to us though the unique thing is that Fitzgerald chooses also to surreally intersperse them together into the present one our current William sees his young self using food as a comfort and he sees his teen self leave behind his obese body in favor of his current slim frame.I liked the way that Fitzgerald chose to tackle the mind's abstract identity in this very literal way and I think it makes the film more interesting than its abusivefatherthoughtfulmother family drama otherwise would be. There are some nice touches in the film like William's apparent young sister who he seems to have swapped gender roles with and there are some really clever scenes like the one where the current William rushes to help his father  and his father seeing that his grown son has been playing dressup or the scene where his mother has to listen to her son's first sexual experience with a woman. The performances are uniformly good for the film's intent but Sarah Polley stands out as doing something beyond what's merely required. 810".

This film was ranked  and fairly as the best Canadian film of 1997 by the Jay Stone of the Globe  Mail Canada's national newspaper and if that makes Americans laugh then consider this is a ranking ahead of Sweet Hereafter which only made it to the Best Director Oscar Nomination and Cannes Recognition for Atom Egoyan and was also Roger Ebert's 2 film of the year.  Adulations all around are deserving for this homegrown production.  The film only suffers from inexperience with some actors and having to come up with a conclusion for a tale that can't logically have one.

The body is suppose to be an illusion yet everyone can see it so it is left unsolved. His sister is marrying his former boyfriend and in a drunken state preparing. It is a film about affliction with sexual content pushed too far and an ending left unresolved. Director Thom Fitzgerald handles the timeline effectively and is backed with beautiful photography. The screenplay is inventive yet somewhat muddled but it holds together thanks to effective casting. Great performances by Chris Leavins Kerry Fox Sarah Polley and Peter McNeill playing characters in and out within this broken family that somehow fail to find common ground to heal the wounds. It regards a father whose love is reserved for the artificial while his son will carry on with the emotional wounds. The rest of the family are just as messed up in priorities and sense of love.

I must say I had some difficulty coming to terms with this aspect of the film which at first glance made no sense at all. I was irritated by it. Taken at face value this aspect of the film was ludicrous. It goes like thisWe have a grotesquely obese teenager who has a homosexual encounter. He is caught in the act by his grandmother and as a result is taken by his mother to see a young woman who's forte is sexual initiation. Either this his previous experience or his obesity depresses him so much that he commits suicide. And we know he succeeds because all the flowers in the garden die with him. But and this is where the madness and contradictions start he comes back from the dead ten years later metamorphosed into a handsome slim young man! And he finds his doppelganger still hanging from the tree in the garden!Now a doppelganger is a figment of someone's imagination a wraith that doesn't really exist and if it had remained as such say a symbolic representation of his earlier life I would have had little  difficulty  in going along with it. But no. He touches it and his dad hugs it and he then buries it and his dad tries to dig it up. Well you can't bury a doppelganger so it must be a real body a body that's been hanging from a tree for ten years without showing  any signs of decomposition. And if it is a real dead body and it's his real dead body how come he's still alive?Now if you can accept all this as not being real behaviour but as some elaborate metaphor for his wish to be free of his past and his dad's wish to cling onto it then you might just enjoy the film. It has a lot of good things going for it.".

I have not seen many movies from Canada and this was really good albeit confusing to me!! Did that make sense?

And the little girl was the daughter of Willie and the prostitute? Wow can you imagine that happening to a kid he didn't want to go to her in the first place.

	schema:headline " I told you to keep away from that radio. If that battery is dead it'll have company.";
	schema:reviewBody "White Heat is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted by Ivan Goff  Ben Roberts from a story suggested by Virginia Kellogg. It stars James Cagney Virginia Mayo Edmond O'Brien Steve Cochran  Margaret Wycherly. Music is by Max Steiner and photography by Sidney Hickox.Cody Jarrett Cagney is the sadistic leader of a violent and ruthless gang of thieves. Unnervingly devoted to his mother Wycherly and afflicted by terrible headaches since childhood Cody is one bad day away from being a full blown psychotic. That day is coming soon and everyone in his way is sure to pay.Around the time of White Heat being released two things were evident as regards its star and its themes. One is that it had been a long time since a gangster and a truly vicious one at that had thrilled or frightened a cinema audience. The Production Code and a change in emotional value due to World War II had seen the genuine career gangster all but disappear. Second thing of note is that Cagney was stung by the disappointing performance of Cagney Productions. So after having left Warner Brothers in 1942 the diminutive star resigned for the studio and returned to the genre he had almost made his own in the 30s. He of course had some say in proceedings such as urging the makers to ensure a crime does not pay motif but all told he needed a hit and the fit with Raoul Walsh and the psychotic Jarrett was perfect. It may not be his best acting performance but it's certainly his most potent and arguably it's the cream of the gangster genre crop.The inspiration for the film is mostly agreed to be the real life criminals Ma Barker Arthur Doc Barker and Francis Crowley. A point of worth being that they were all 30s criminals since White Heat very much looks and feels like a 30s movie. Cagney for sure is older he was 50 at the time and more rotund but he and the film have the presence and vibrancy respectively to keep it suitably in period and in the process becoming the last of its kind. White Heat is that rare old beast that manages to have a conventional action story at its core yet still be unique in structure and portrayal of the lead character. Neatly crafted by Walsh around four Cody Jarrett moments of importance the Oedipal tones playing out between Cody and his Ma make for an uneasy experience but even then Walsh and the team pull a rabbit out the hat by still garnering sympathy for the crazed protagonist. It sounds nutty but it really is one of the big reasons why White Heat is the great film that it is. Another reason of course is those special scenes two of which are folklore cinematic legends now. Note legend number 1 as Cody incarcerated receives bad news the reaction is at once terrifying and pitiful note the extras reaction here since they didn't know what was coming.

	onyx:emotionText "White Heat is directed by Raoul Walsh and adapted by Ivan Goff  Ben Roberts from a story suggested by Virginia Kellogg. It stars James Cagney Virginia Mayo Edmond O'Brien Steve Cochran  Margaret Wycherly. Music is by Max Steiner and photography by Sidney Hickox.Cody Jarrett Cagney is the sadistic leader of a violent and ruthless gang of thieves. Unnervingly devoted to his mother Wycherly and afflicted by terrible headaches since childhood Cody is one bad day away from being a full blown psychotic. That day is coming soon and everyone in his way is sure to pay.Around the time of White Heat being released two things were evident as regards its star and its themes. One is that it had been a long time since a gangster and a truly vicious one at that had thrilled or frightened a cinema audience. The Production Code and a change in emotional value due to World War II had seen the genuine career gangster all but disappear. Second thing of note is that Cagney was stung by the disappointing performance of Cagney Productions. So after having left Warner Brothers in 1942 the diminutive star resigned for the studio and returned to the genre he had almost made his own in the 30s. He of course had some say in proceedings such as urging the makers to ensure a crime does not pay motif but all told he needed a hit and the fit with Raoul Walsh and the psychotic Jarrett was perfect. It may not be his best acting performance but it's certainly his most potent and arguably it's the cream of the gangster genre crop.The inspiration for the film is mostly agreed to be the real life criminals Ma Barker Arthur Doc Barker and Francis Crowley. A point of worth being that they were all 30s criminals since White Heat very much looks and feels like a 30s movie. Cagney for sure is older he was 50 at the time and more rotund but he and the film have the presence and vibrancy respectively to keep it suitably in period and in the process becoming the last of its kind. White Heat is that rare old beast that manages to have a conventional action story at its core yet still be unique in structure and portrayal of the lead character. Neatly crafted by Walsh around four Cody Jarrett moments of importance the Oedipal tones playing out between Cody and his Ma make for an uneasy experience but even then Walsh and the team pull a rabbit out the hat by still garnering sympathy for the crazed protagonist. It sounds nutty but it really is one of the big reasons why White Heat is the great film that it is. Another reason of course is those special scenes two of which are folklore cinematic legends now. Note legend number 1 as Cody incarcerated receives bad news the reaction is at once terrifying and pitiful note the extras reaction here since they didn't know what was coming. Legend number 2 comes with that ending forever quotable and as octane ignited finale's go it takes some beating. As brilliant and memorable as Cagney is it's not however a one man show. He's superbly directed by Walsh with the great director maintaining a pace and rhythm to match Cody Jarrett's state of mind.

There's nary a dull moment with Jimmy on hand whether having his mother ease his migraine tantrums by rubbing his head or shooting a fellow gang member through the trunk of his car in order to give him a little air. Raoul Walsh vigorously directs this movie with remarkable gusto given that he was over sixty at the time and at at this point in his career had nothing to prove. Cagney's character of Cody Jarrett is shown to be a madman at the start of the film. There's no need for his confederates to engage in a little isheorisn'the chitchat regarding his sanity a la The Caine Mutiny. They know he's mad. Even his mother knows he's mad. No matter. Cody continues on his crime spree and his gang stays loyal to him if only for the consequences of leaving him being to frightening to contemplate. He has a girl who twotimes him with another gang member. A federal agent who infiltrates the gang and becomes a surrogate mother by easing his headaches in the same manner also betrays him though it's his job to do so. Only Ma Jarrett it seems could be trusted.One of the many charms of this film is its absolute refusal to make a statement which wasn't Raoul Walsh's bag anyway and screenwriters Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts though they delve into Freud a bit don't get too heavy over Cagney's psychopathology. They just accept it show us its various sides and leave it at that. This movie is a far cry from other films made around the same time was highly popular when first released and remains so to this day. It is not quite film noir being too bright and rational. Nor is it a study in perverse psychology despite its main character.  For all the location filming it is no semidocumentary in the manner of House On 92nd Street. It is basically a lively action picture whose makers taking a cue from Hiroshima bomb decided to end their movie with a bang making their show a fine example of good clean apocalyptic fun.".

Unfortunately for Cody he does not get away clean but he has a card up his sleeve do time for another lesser crime he had committed earlier so that he can avoid the severe punishment of this one. While unable to step in the treasury responds by having an agent assume the alias of Vic Pardo and pose as an inmate and befriend Cody so that the law can bring him and gang to justice. Meanwhile his wife and his former righthand man make plans of their own move the organization forward and without Cody  literally. Pardo inadvertently foils their assassination attempt a move which makes his bond with Jarrett even stronger. The two eventually get out of jail and while Cody quickly regains control and even lines up his next heist the payroll of a major chemical plant he remains unaware of Pardo's real intentions. Cody's gang and the law both converge on the plant which becomes the set piece for a literally explosive conclusion.What surprised me the most about White Heat is its energy and speed. Instead of having the careful measured pace typical of 40's film noir it resembles what a featurelength episode of 24 would be like and given the volatility of the Jarrett character this is entirely appropriate. Cagney definitely sunk his teeth into the role his creepy behavior especially his relationship with his mother really gets under your skin and when he's violent he makes even Joe Pesci in Goodfellas seem tame. The violence in general is very shocking there are many shootings and each one hasn't a shred of regret or remorse. As for the movie's two major heists both are simply thrilling to watch not to mention interesting in how they reveal how criminals operated during that era. Still what is even more interesting is how the law uses technology to chase down Jarrett and his gang. There is heavy and seemingly accurate use of car phones radar detection and other techniques I had no idea were in use at the time. I will admit however that the movie did not leave me with a whole lot to think about afterward which is disappointing given Jarrett's strange quirks which while unique only seemed to be there for the plot's sake rather than examine of the burdens of having an Oedipus complex. Still I will not deny that I was entertained and I would be hard pressed to find a better example of noir and action done right.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cagney's ability to shock is constant and each new gangster he creates shows a new facet of the psychopathic mind.  White heat is the perfect antidote to the earlier movies the structure where good triumphs in the last reel is still there but the killer out of control is far less romanticised if only current directors could develop this message.  Cody Jarrett is the product of an over protective mother and thug father in the classic pattern.  His whole view of the world is simplistic without subtlety or shade. Like all people of his type his selfconfidence betrays him because he sees other people as stereotypes and while he has insight into the sorts of people who form his support network he very unwisely dismisses the intelligence of the opposition.  Like all gangsters he has very little grasp of the outside world throughout the film he is trapped in boxes just like the man he kills in the boot of his car. Cagney's portrayal is his greatest role his avoidance of pathos and his refusal to bend emotionally mean that we are never invited to pity him wherever there seems to be a point of access for the audience he delivers the lines with a flatness which denies us sympathy.  His maudlin obsession with his mother invites us to loathe his infantile mental paralysis. Not enough comments praise the real costar Margaret Wycherley. She is a sinister mother who can handle the police and the gang and Cody's wife.  Her worldweary cynicism her obsession with her son delivered in the same deadpan style is such a total antithesis to the usual hollywood 'caring parent' model that she raises the character to the level of an Empress Livia or an Agrippina. The final scene works on multiple levels the goodguy cannot easily destroy the villain does the world blow up in Cody's face or are we being told that the Jarretts of the world will dominate until they bring the universe to destruction? A film which still demands analysis and does more to reveal the nature of criminal amorality than anything Tarrantino or Scorsese could produce The latter types of director are too caught up in the 'romance' of the villainous life they need to develop Raoul Walsh's objectivity and Cagney's penetration.  It is Cagney's unequivocal hatred of the character he's portraying and the personal honesty which allows him to objectify both the character he is playing and himself as an actor that makes the whole thing work.  The crude method actors we're stuck with today could learn a lot from his Cody Jarrett!".

Cody Jarrett is the product of an over protective mother and thug father in the classic pattern.  His whole view of the world is simplistic without subtlety or shade. Like all people of his type his selfconfidence betrays him because he sees other people as stereotypes and while he has insight into the sorts of people who form his support network he very unwisely dismisses the intelligence of the opposition.  Like all gangsters he has very little grasp of the outside world throughout the film he is trapped in boxes just like the man he kills in the boot of his car. Cagney's portrayal is his greatest role his avoidance of pathos and his refusal to bend emotionally mean that we are never invited to pity him wherever there seems to be a point of access for the audience he delivers the lines with a flatness which denies us sympathy.  His maudlin obsession with his mother invites us to loathe his infantile mental paralysis. Not enough comments praise the real costar Margaret Wycherley. She is a sinister mother who can handle the police and the gang and Cody's wife.  Her worldweary cynicism her obsession with her son delivered in the same deadpan style is such a total antithesis to the usual hollywood 'caring parent' model that she raises the character to the level of an Empress Livia or an Agrippina. The final scene works on multiple levels the goodguy cannot easily destroy the villain does the world blow up in Cody's face or are we being told that the Jarretts of the world will dominate until they bring the universe to destruction? A film which still demands analysis and does more to reveal the nature of criminal amorality than anything Tarrantino or Scorsese could produce The latter types of director are too caught up in the 'romance' of the villainous life they need to develop Raoul Walsh's objectivity and Cagney's penetration.  It is Cagney's unequivocal hatred of the character he's portraying and the personal honesty which allows him to objectify both the character he is playing and himself as an actor that makes the whole thing work.  The crude method actors we're stuck with today could learn a lot from his Cody Jarrett!";

	schema:reviewBody "White Heat has a complex if ingenious plot. Arthur Cody Jarrett is the leader of a gang of criminals who have carried out a train robbery during which four men were shot dead. It becomes clear however to Jarrett that the police suspect him of this crime so in order to throw them off the scent he flies to Illinois where he confesses to a quite different robbery in which he had no involvement at all. The two robberies took place on the same day so Jarrett believes he has the perfect alibi. If he was robbing a hotel in Illinois he could not have been robbing a train in California. The Illinois robbery involved no killings so only carries a relatively light sentence.The police however are aware that Jarrett's guilty plea to the Illinois robbery is not genuine and infiltrate an agent posing as a convict under the assumed name Vic Pardo into the prison where Jarrett is serving his sentence. The idea is that Pardo will be placed into the same cell as Jarrett to see if he will talk about the California robbery. Events then take an unexpected turn. Unknown to Jarrett his lieutenant Big Ed is also the lover of his beautiful young wife Verna and has ambitions to take control of the gang. Ed has an associate inside the prison whom he orders to kill Jarrett. Jarrett's life is saved however by Pardo's intervention. Jarrett's elderly mother to whom he is very close finds out about the attempt on her son's life and swears to get revenge although he begs her not to. The old lady confronts Big Ed and Verna but is shot dead by them. Jarrett maddened by grief at his mother's death escapes from prison taking Pardo with him as a hostage. Jarrett resumes his career as a criminal leading to a final showdown with the police.White Heat is sometimes characterised as a film noir although I prefer to think of it and other similar gangster films as not quite noir. Although its subjectmatter is crime and it uses the dramatic lighting effects and photography that were characteristic of film noir it lacks another typical noir characteristic an atmosphere of moral ambiguity. It is a copsandrobbers thriller with the moral boundaries very clearly defined the cops are good and the robbers are bad. Those parts of the film which deal with the FBI could almost have been written by J. Edgar Hoover himself. The government agents are cleancut brave honourable incorruptible and a good deal smarter and more resourceful than the likes of Jarrett give them credit for.That does not however make White Heat an inferior film. Today a film with such clearcut moral distinctions would be regarded at best nave as and simplistic and at worst as disguised government propaganda so used have we become to films which portray the police either as corrupt e.g. L.A. Confidential or as hilariously incompetent e.g. the Police Academy series or as brutal and heavyhanded numerous examples from Dirty Harry onwards. A crime film however which expresses a moral preference for law enforcers over law breakers is not necessarily suspect any more than is a war film which shows the Allies as being morally better than the Nazis.Although the film's sympathies are very much with the forces of law and order it is the villainous characters rather than the virtuous ones that stand out Virginia Mayo's Verna Margaret Wycherly's Ma and most of all James Cagney's superb performance as Jarrett. He is a psychopathic criminal who will kill without remorse anyone who gets in his way be they policemen or innocent bystanders or even members of his own gang. He leaves to die one of the gang who was injured during the train robbery. He has no feelings for Verna and treats her coldly and callously doubtless the reason why she turned to Big Ed for comfort. His one good quality is his deep love for his mother yet even this can often seem suspect. A word frequently used about it is oedipal which implies that it is not so much a redeeming virtue as a symptom of his underlying psychiatric illness. There are two particularly memorable scenes in the film. The first is the one where he learns of his mother's death while in prison. Cagney brings an intensity to this scene that makes Jarrett's rage seem particularly frightening. The second is the famous top of the world scene the final shootout with the police in the chemical plant in which Jarrett despite his vicious character achieves a certain insane grandeur. In Jarrett's disordered mind he really is top of the world. When I reviewed the original version of Get Carter on this website I stated that I had never seen another film which better reveals the sterility and futility of the criminal lifestyle. Having now seen White Heat I can say that Get Carter now has a rival in this regard. 910".

	schema:headline " James Cagney's performance is amazing";
	schema:reviewBody "Though the acting in this film is excellent all around Cagney steals the show. His performance is good not just because he was an excellent actor but because he knew just how far to take the role of Cody without appearing cartoonish. He spends much of the film stomping around like a petulant angry little boy but then he surprises with a few moments of gentle reminiscing about his mother. His command of the role is remarkable because he seems to know the character so well that he becomes Cody I think this is the ultimate statement about an actor's skills because you forget that he's acting. His every expression roll of his eyes sneer maniacal laugh howl of anger or glee these things came from his heart. The scene where Cagney walks out of the house eating a drumstick and casually ventilating the trunk of the car with his gun is something that Tarentino might have used fifty years later. And I doubt that anyone could fail to see how deeply he loved his mother after his wail of despair when he learns of her death. His stunned disbelief at learning Fallon is a cop practically leaps off the screen I treated him like a kid brother. It's a wretched scene. It's hard to believe this is the same actor who made such impossible dance moves in Yankee Doodle Dandy. James Cagney was a remarkable actor. I doubt that any contemporary actor ever possessed the same kind of intensity. James Caan was once this intense a long time ago.Virginia Mayo is radiant whether being treacherous or purring like a kitten as it suits her plans. Cody doesn't really care for her even when he's carrying her piggyback around the house. It seems warm and lighthearted but she'll never take the place of dear old mom and she knows it. Her best line is delivered at the end of the movie when she's trying to save her own neck you dirty copper. The way she says it always makes me laugh. But don't turn your back on her if you know what I mean.Raoul Walsh's tight direction doesn't let you stop for a moment. Something is always happening in the movie even at the very end where the alien landscape is dominated by gigantic refinery spheres. This is postwar U.S. prosperity where Cody's oldfashioned gangster world doesn't belong and the results are predictably abrupt and terrifying. They even use a primitive form of GPS to catch him and walk around with walkietalkies technology that Cody couldn't begin to understand. Out with the old world in with the new.Edmond O'Brien is good too but he's no match against Cagney and knows it so he plays it really straight and lowkey. You can see the desperation in his face. I think Walsh was ahead of his time when he played the truck driver I forget his name against Fallon where they constantly kept missing each other's faces by a split second it's really clever the way Walsh does this and you find yourself saying oh no several times as they just miss each other. It's almost humorous the way Walsh does this. Only at the end do their eyes finally meet and there's the spark of recognition.This movie is fantastic and every bit as groundbreaking as Citizen Kane or Sunset Boulevard. At least watch it for James Cagney there will never be another actor like him.".

	schema:reviewBody "This classic was offered as part of Turner's crime week behind bars series and to be honest I didn't expect much not being a fan of gangster flicks. But the fastpaced noholds barred direction didn't let up a tribute to the director R. Walsh. The movie seems to avoid the cliches of shoot'em ups because it defines them. It's a straight tale told with no irony. While all the supporting characters are good including Ma Garrett what holds the picture together is Cagney's charisma. From his opening scene jumping onto the train to the chase at the end leading to the conflagration I had the feeling that I was watching a desperate caged animal. When policemen refer to a face as a mug they were probably thinking of Cagney. What a mug!  and when he pulled the trigger all the venom in his veins came shooting out.Only a few actors in the history of cinema give so much of themselves and when they do we recognize them as stars. I think the reason White Heat gets such a high score from reviewers is that few of us actors or audience have the guts to show this kind of evil or allout desperation in an otherwise tame movie and to recognize it as part of one's nature not as part of an act which is how most actors would do the hoodlum or bad guy in other run of the mill films. One difference between the film noir of the forties is how this evil is conceived by the writers. In White Heat while Cagney doesn't torture anyone he gets his kicks from shooting them or allowing them to be steamed to death. short and sweet. Later postWW II movies would place evil in the form of a Nazi with torture and then by the nineties we have psychological evil in the form of Hannibal Lecter and the very slow roast where noone can outwit him. Anthony Hopkins' genius was to grasp the psychopathic side of himself and allow it to be revealed on screen.Cagney had courage to let out unbridled badness. This affected his costar bringing out Mayo's terror in one scene so she didn't have to act either according to a recent interview describing their working together. It's a pity to learn from the other reviews that this movie hit the top of Cagney's career and that it was downhill after that.".

	schema:headline " White Heat";
	schema:reviewBody "The quintessential tough guy James Cagney is always a joy to watch on film. Possibly his most famous film White Heat a Raoul Walsh feature from 1949 Cagney stars as a cold seemingly heartless criminal who reserves a soft spot for only one person his mother. Also starring Virginia Mayo and Edmond O'Brien White Heat has become a seminal crime drama and film noir classic and for good reason. A reinvention of his toughguy characters of years past James Cagney seamlessly reintroduces the audience to his unique brand of Hollywood tough guy.Maniacal intense and frightening are just a few words one can use to describe Cody Jarrett James Cagney the ruthless leader of a gang of criminals. Despite his marriage to Verna Jarrett Virginia Mayo Cody is loyal to only one person his mother. Ma Jarrett Margaret Wycherly is the epicenter of Cody Jarrett she is his safe place the only place he can escape the world and be shielded from all that triggers his neuroses. Cody suffers from bouts of erratic behaviors that begin as headaches and are thought to have been passed down to him from his father who passed away in a mental institution. These bouts of hysteria make the henchmen members of Cody's gang nervous and they begin to plot for an accident to happen to Cody. After a messy yet successful robbery they may get their chance. Cody's name is uttered in a train robbery resulting in many murders including the one in his gang who revealed his name and the Jarrett gang is having trouble escaping the police interest. Cody decides that the best way to avoid the police hunting for his gang is to confess to a crime committed in Illinois at the same time as the train robbery. This confession should be a win win for Cody he will only spend 2 years in jail avoid a certain gas chamber death and be able to build additional criminal contacts while in prison. Simultaneously police unconvinced that Cody was actually responsible for the crime in Illinois have arranged for an undercover officer to be bunked with Cody through his prison stay. Vic Pardo Edmond O'Brien is the name taken by the undercover officer whose sole purpose is to get close to Cody and get enough information to implicate Cody for the train robbery. Everything is going smoothly until Cody finds out his mother has been killed. The only person that could calm Cody Jarrett's demons is gone and Cody is set on seeking revenge for her death. Cody organizes a prison breakout along with Vic Pardo to avenge his mother's death and execute one more great heist.No review of White Heat would be complete without discussing the acting talent of its synonymous star. James Cagney was the perfect everyman tough guy his stature was short and unopposing meaning that all of the fear he would need to bring to the audience was reliant upon his acting. After about 10 minutes into the film you definitely fear Cagney's Cody Jarrett. Cagney had an extremely facially expressive face oftentimes actors that rely on their facial expressions to carry their acting come off like they're just chewing the scenery. It can be distracting to watch an actor with an expressive face but Cagney never falls into that trap rather the expressiveness of his face goes a long way to building who is character is. For instance the best part of Cody Jarrett's character a testament to the exceptional acting of James Cagney is the controlled method he uses to keep his neuroses restrained. Cody knows he has a propensity toward psychotic episodes he is not in denial about that in order to keep his gang going he must keep this psychosis under control. Without his mother Cagney's security erodes and his psychosis is unable to be controlled bringing audiences the most thrilling decline of a man in cinema history all thanks to Cagney's brilliant execution. Raoul Walsh is certainly responsible for much of what is great about White Heat as well.

	onyx:emotionText "The quintessential tough guy James Cagney is always a joy to watch on film. Possibly his most famous film White Heat a Raoul Walsh feature from 1949 Cagney stars as a cold seemingly heartless criminal who reserves a soft spot for only one person his mother. Also starring Virginia Mayo and Edmond O'Brien White Heat has become a seminal crime drama and film noir classic and for good reason. A reinvention of his toughguy characters of years past James Cagney seamlessly reintroduces the audience to his unique brand of Hollywood tough guy.Maniacal intense and frightening are just a few words one can use to describe Cody Jarrett James Cagney the ruthless leader of a gang of criminals. Despite his marriage to Verna Jarrett Virginia Mayo Cody is loyal to only one person his mother. Ma Jarrett Margaret Wycherly is the epicenter of Cody Jarrett she is his safe place the only place he can escape the world and be shielded from all that triggers his neuroses. Cody suffers from bouts of erratic behaviors that begin as headaches and are thought to have been passed down to him from his father who passed away in a mental institution. These bouts of hysteria make the henchmen members of Cody's gang nervous and they begin to plot for an accident to happen to Cody. After a messy yet successful robbery they may get their chance. Cody's name is uttered in a train robbery resulting in many murders including the one in his gang who revealed his name and the Jarrett gang is having trouble escaping the police interest. Cody decides that the best way to avoid the police hunting for his gang is to confess to a crime committed in Illinois at the same time as the train robbery. This confession should be a win win for Cody he will only spend 2 years in jail avoid a certain gas chamber death and be able to build additional criminal contacts while in prison. Simultaneously police unconvinced that Cody was actually responsible for the crime in Illinois have arranged for an undercover officer to be bunked with Cody through his prison stay. Vic Pardo Edmond O'Brien is the name taken by the undercover officer whose sole purpose is to get close to Cody and get enough information to implicate Cody for the train robbery. Everything is going smoothly until Cody finds out his mother has been killed. The only person that could calm Cody Jarrett's demons is gone and Cody is set on seeking revenge for her death. Cody organizes a prison breakout along with Vic Pardo to avenge his mother's death and execute one more great heist.No review of White Heat would be complete without discussing the acting talent of its synonymous star. James Cagney was the perfect everyman tough guy his stature was short and unopposing meaning that all of the fear he would need to bring to the audience was reliant upon his acting. After about 10 minutes into the film you definitely fear Cagney's Cody Jarrett. Cagney had an extremely facially expressive face oftentimes actors that rely on their facial expressions to carry their acting come off like they're just chewing the scenery. It can be distracting to watch an actor with an expressive face but Cagney never falls into that trap rather the expressiveness of his face goes a long way to building who is character is. For instance the best part of Cody Jarrett's character a testament to the exceptional acting of James Cagney is the controlled method he uses to keep his neuroses restrained. Cody knows he has a propensity toward psychotic episodes he is not in denial about that in order to keep his gang going he must keep this psychosis under control. Without his mother Cagney's security erodes and his psychosis is unable to be controlled bringing audiences the most thrilling decline of a man in cinema history all thanks to Cagney's brilliant execution. Raoul Walsh is certainly responsible for much of what is great about White Heat as well. The score was a fantastic selection taking on a character of its own accentuating the mental processes of Cagney's Cody Jarrett. The telephone scene and the following fit of grief in which Cody finds out about his mother's death was cinematic brilliance. When Cody surprises his gang after breaking out of prison and the light shines on his face upon opening the door and catching his wide with an associate of his is a scene that will stay with the audience long after the film ends.

	schema:reviewBody "What is it to have an authentic thought? There is nothing mirrored and not even a mirror it somehow gives the impression that it springs from air. Cagney was nothing if not an authentic guy and there's no talking about this without Cagney. The film is perfectly tense and gripping in general a brooding crime melodrama about a broken man who flings his pieces at the world. But Cagney makes it matter.Sure you'll see here in his last gangster role a set of mannerisms more psychotic than usual. Nicholson no doubt took note for his Joker. Alternately you may think of him in this film as an early Pacino creating gravitas out of nothing. Two things you should know here about Cagney he was one of very few Hollywood stars who was committed to a long marriage and he had a deep bonding to his mother.So what powerful alignment here! In this role he is required as Cody Jarrett to face the possibilities of betrayal by his wife and that his relationship with his mother is deep down psychotic and even the cause of his wanting to be on the stage. Together it means he must play someone who faces loneliness and age while plotting some crime story.I hope I'm not presuming too much. But Cagney was an intelligent man and though he was never quite a Method actor he couldn't fail to implicitly recognize the situation. In his big scene of the breakdown the story goes that he told the filmmaker to keep the cameras rolling no matter what meaning he knew he could find the place from which to throw himself.So this inarticulate recognition creates all the tension. Methodists like Brando and Clift knowing this is powerful would try to mask the pain artfully presenting sides to the camera so that we'd infer the rest. Cagney completely throws himself in the thing holds and conceals nothing. This isn't masterful in the Method sense of consciously inhabiting a self controlling it's skiing on the tension. It cuts because you can tell that it cuts him to face what he must as the character. His anguished wails in that scene felt to me like genuinely some inner child being torn.The climax is pretty great what they pulled off from doing at the last moment in Angels 10 years before.Noir Meter 24".

	schema:reviewBody "White Heat was something of a comeback for James Cagney. Curiously enough ever since his Oscar winning portrayal of George M. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy Cagney's films had either not been all that great or were getting critical kudos but no box office. By reinventing himself in the gangster genre Cagney bounced back to the top of film stardom.Cody Jarrett is definitely the gangster redefined for Cagney. It's light years different from Tom Powers in Public Enemy. In those early Warner Brothers features Cagney is a slum kid who's rising to the top through fists and brains but he's not psychotic. Cody Jarrett gives us a whole new Cagney a ruthless incredibly shrewd head of a criminal gang with insanity galloping through his family. The insanity comes from his father the brains from his mother. Margaret Wycherly got her career role in White Heat as Ma Jarrett. Obviously modeled on Ma Barker she's one tough woman. And street smart. One of my favorite scenes is how she shakes the treasury tail that was put on her. It's only dumb luck that John Bryant the agent in charge finds the motel that Wycherly Cagney and Virginia Mayo are staying.This was also a return to the slatternly roles for Virginia Mayo. She first was noticed in Samuel Goldwyn's The Best Years of Our Lives as Dana Andrews's trampy wife. After that she was playing good girls in lightweight stuff. Back as Cody's two timing wife she gets the best role of her career as well. As FBI informer Edmond O'Brien has the unenviable job of getting close to Jarrett. The plot of the film has Cagney turning himself in on a minor robbery charge to avoid being tagged for the robbery at the beginning of the film of a U.S. mail train where four people are killed. The feds don't believe it so O'Brien who apparently specializes in going into prison to mix among the cons and gain information gets the job of going undercover in Joliet prison in Illinois to get close to Cagney. He succeeds but the plans take a different and sudden turn which you will have to see the film for.Even in today's world which certainly has more explicit cinema violence than back in 1949. White Heat is not for the squeamish. But you will feel the tension every minute. And that climax.........Well didn't he make it to the top of the gangster world. Ma was probably very proud.".

The scene in the prison when Cody runs amok was truly memorable as is the ending to a very gripping welltold story. The photography did seem to lack clarity in a way that surprisingly helped the mood that permeated all the way through  the background music had a major role in this also.

The scene in the prison when Cody runs amok was truly memorable as is the ending to a very gripping welltold story. The photography did seem to lack clarity in a way that surprisingly helped the mood that permeated all the way through  the background music had a major role in this also. When one thinks of Cagney these days Yankee Doodle Dandy and White Heat are the two films that spring to mind for me.";

The characters actually fight over who gets to eat the milky way and describe why they love the product so much. Seriously? Aside from those things there were a lot of little crappy plot devices that were way too forced. Why is Noah suddenly getting raped by Satan? Why does Franco's new multi million dollar concrete fortress home collapse within minutes catching fire and why does it have a basement you can only access from outside? The overwhelming success of this movie in only its second week is proof that the standards of young movie goers is almost non existent.

To me it was nothing more than 107 minutes of a selfindulgence where the actors were so caught up in their awesome idea for a film they forgot to actually WRITE SOME WITTY DIALOG! Seriously the scene between Franco and McBride about leaving loads all over the place was humorous for the first 5 seconds but hey...why not stretch this 7th grade humor out another 2 minutes? The audience will LOVE it because WE think it's funny and WE ARE SO AWESOME! I found it offensive not for the subject matter but for how they treat the audience. Rogan thinks his jokes about 'playing the same character in every movie' somehow make it excusable to sit back and do it again? This is a lazy sophomoric stupid humorless pile of stinking garbage that makes me feel bad about losing the 60 minutes of my life I lost before coming out of my coma and walking out.Rogan and crew even though they DO play the same characters all the time can at LEAST feel good that they have some witty dialog in their movies.

It's brilliant that they all just play themselves and manage to poke fun at their own lifestyles. Expect weed and drug humor of course. The plot sets itself up for hilarity as they all take refuge in James Franco's fortress of a mansion while the world outside them goes up in flames. Cabin fever mixed with dwindling supplies results in hilarious situations and good one liners. The movie made me laugh extremely hard and had all my favorite people in one film. I only wouldn't recommend this film if you're uptight and religious.".

I found the first couple of scenes funny but then the movie just took a nosedive. I get that they are poking fun at their lifestyles but is Rogan boasting to the world that he's a pothead? And if Michael Cera doesn't really snort cocaine then why on Earth would he want to portray that he does?? These aren't characters that they are playing they are playing themselves in this film. So this movie tells me that these people are immature drug obsessed morons and it is a real shame that people like this get paid incredible salaries when so many real good people are out there slaving on minimum wage. I know some people may think I've overanalyzing this but I'm not. In a movie where the actors portray themselves I'm personally stunned that they willingly participated in a movie where not only aren't they selected to get in Heaven that they continue to act like immature imbeciles especially McBride in a time of biblical apocalypse. And one last note anyone that finds images of a man's junk everywhere hilarious really has some maturing to do. If I could give this movie no stars I would.

However I thought this movie was really bad.At the beginning of the movie I found almost all jokes and everything very amusing. i thought it was going to be great until after Danny McBribes scene when he appear. From that point on it just went down hill. The jokes started to get worse. I thought I was the only one at first that thought the movie was getting a little redundant and ridiculous. It was then when i looked around and relieved people had stopped laughing as well. I found myself waiting for the movie to get better but it was just getting worse the jokes were just getting run into the ground Danny McBride and James Franco referring to masturbating on everything. By the end all I could think was I wasted 10.50.One of the most disappointing was almost all the actors. Seth Rogen awful. Michael Cera really weird. Jonah Hill just bizarre I mean I personally found his performance really strange. Craig Robinson Okay but wasn't very funny. Danny McBribe funny at first but then grew on as very annoying. James Franco funny. Overall I really did not like this movie. Between the rape references and biblical references I found it to be really weird. I usually don't care about that stuff but like I said they would drive it into the ground. I would honestly wait until this is on Netflix. Trust me this will be on Netflix's for sure. Really not worth 10.50.".

Franco and McBride can be hilarious but this was far from their finest moment. Seriously we collectively laughed 4 times. I kept count. The only reason that I am giving this a 2 and not a 1 is that there was a scene where some large 4 legged demon came launching into the scene and my mother jumped and dumped half her candy.How do I get my money back for this complete waste? I feel completely and utterly duped. The reviews said it was great overall I wonder what has happened to society when an entire scene dedicated to an argument about masturbating on a magazine is funny. There have been some funny jokes about masturbation in other movies this sure as hell isn't one of them.I seriously want my money back.".

Has moments that will remind you of Little Nicky which itself is awful too but even if you found that movie entertaining in any way its still a million times more awful. Sometimes films are so bad it's funny and this probably was the purpose of the film but it couldn't even do that properly it was just plain awful. This film was only made to get the stars on screen and try to make it big at the box office while celeb cameos and an OK trailer will draw you in don't be fooled it truly is one of the most awful films ever made.

But I've had over a week to think on it and I have decided that Overall I really enjoyed watching This is the End.I love the cast I think everyone in this movie is talented and really funny. They all have such great chemistry together but also all have something of their own to offer. The funniest part of the movie for me and my friends I think was a several minute long back and forth between Danny Mcbride and James Franco but I would watch the movie again for that scene alone So overall This is the End is a really fun over the top movie.

It made me think of Yann Tiersen the composer of the music of Amlie Poulain and Dlicatessen. The music gives you an alternative American feelgood moviefeeling. The film is about the serious worries of a 10 year old boy not really satisfied with his life and his looks and in love with Sarah. Together with Gloria she made me think of a punkversion of Whoopi Goldberg they're looking for Morgan's father in London. The story is not very complicated it's just an ideal film for a cost evening.

It made me think of Yann Tiersen the composer of the music of Amlie Poulain and Dlicatessen. The music gives you an alternative American feelgood moviefeeling. The film is about the serious worries of a 10 year old boy not really satisfied with his life and his looks and in love with Sarah. Together with Gloria she made me think of a punkversion of Whoopi Goldberg they're looking for Morgan's father in London. The story is not very complicated it's just an ideal film for a cost evening. Nice film shooting brilliant musicgood actors... very nice!";

Using nothing but original vehicles uniforms weapons equipment and even ships this one delivers a true story in an interesting and entertaining way. All from the view point of just one man from a small town in Oregon. The directorwriters did not feel the need to rewrite history or over dramatize the story with ridiculous special effects excessive blood or gore! Yet it still has all the REAL aspects of war anger pain monotony excitement and even the hopes fears and love interests too. With spectacular production value they kept it simple and powerful.

	onyx:emotionText "Far too many Hollywood made films forget the truth in their quest to cash in on historically inspired stories. Also most want to come from the big or grand picture point of view. Using nothing but original vehicles uniforms weapons equipment and even ships this one delivers a true story in an interesting and entertaining way. All from the view point of just one man from a small town in Oregon. The directorwriters did not feel the need to rewrite history or over dramatize the story with ridiculous special effects excessive blood or gore! Yet it still has all the REAL aspects of war anger pain monotony excitement and even the hopes fears and love interests too. With spectacular production value they kept it simple and powerful. As such I find it a very moving and honest tribute to the simple soldier in WW2. A must see movie!";

	schema:reviewBody "May Contain Minor Spoilers Fallen Not Forgotten tells the tale of Sergeant Don Smith who at 19 volunteered for the Army and in 1944 participated in the Battle Of The Bulge one of the bloodiest battles of World War Two and the final mass German offensive of the war.At the center of the film is Sergeant Smith Cole Carson an everyman standin for everything we think of when we picture the sort of cleancut AllAmerican boys who volunteered for duty before the draft caught them. As he confronts the horrors of war he longs for Dorrine the brighteyed redheaded singer who is hopefully waiting for him back home. Beyond his survival the budding romance he left behind is the key stakes for Smith who can't help but wonder how the world and his place in it will have changed by the time he returns home if ever.Fallen however falls distinctly within the genre of a comrade warfilm like Saving Private Ryan or the Band of Brothers miniseries. Smith gets the most limelight but Fallen tries to split the focus otherwise equally among his friends in the 94th Infantry. Two in particular grabbed my interest. Pvt. Benedetto a down on his luck miscreant who took Army service over jailtime and Pvt. Heinrich an enlistee of German heritage who  after confronting antiGerman bigotry back in the states  was compelled by patriotic pride to assert undeniably his Americanism by enlist and fight. While Smith pines for his love back in the states Benedetto struggles under the disciplinarian Army regimen at one point abandoning his post to meet an opportunistic Frenchman and trade rations for a cask of brandy. Heinrich meanwhile has to work and fight twice as hard as any soldier in the 94th to earn the respect of his brothers in arms who predictably haven't taken any special liking to the man in their midst with the heavy German accent.The split narrative was one of the highlights my concern for these two characters and their survival sometimes even overshadowed Smith's everyman story which while engaging has been told many time before. With better editing and a tighter script they could have made for an amazing movie.But the split narrative was also unfortunately one of Fallen's primary weaknesses.Like the Battle of the Bulge Fallen Not Forgotten is technically a victory. It was enjoyable as a war film and the romantic thread interwoven was sufficiently dramatic enough to keep me engaged and rooting for Sergeant Smith. The acting was in a few instances applauseworthy it wasn't entirely cringefree and Tom Hanks and the rest of Private Ryan's cast aren't going to be handing over any of their awards but for a war film they passed the bar.But the Battle of the Bulge was despite being the final nail in the Nazi coffin hardly the huge success the Allied generals would have wanted. They barely held on. American troops spent a month entirely surrounded by Germans cut off from their supplies starving freezing in the snow low on ammunition and even lower in spirit.Fallen Not Forgotten I'd say barely held on. As an indie production it took risks your usual blockbuster studio war film wouldn't even contemplate and while they didn't fail I can't honestly say they succeeded.Early disorganization was one of the hardest hurdles to overcome for me as a viewer. Within the first few minutes there's a  double  framing device the first shot presents Smith narrating as an old man only to them zoom to 1944 with a battlehardened young Smith now serving to frame with another sometimes hokey narration. Then we flashback to before the war or at least before our heroes joined to learn how they all got into the Army.Then we flash forward again or I think so anyways. By then I was thoroughly confused. The introductions of each character come one after the other prolonging the relatively boring first act setup without ever giving me enough time to get to know these characters I remained uncertain about some of their names well into the film.Fallen held my interest long enough to get me into middle act though which redeems the sloppy introduction and flows relatively seamlessly thereon. The action sequences are what you'd expect from an independent production don't hold your breath for any huge cinematic shots or dazzling special effects but it holds its own. Nor does it suffer from any excessive gore or overglorification of violence which should make it more accessibly to a wider audience.Scoring isn't great and the narration detracts from immersion but the cinematography is decent and Cole Carson's acting improves once the plot gives him more to work with. His struggle with being promoted to Sergeant provides good plot juice and for a novice actor he delivers well the emotional turmoil of the sudden responsibility for his men their survival and his own leadership whether it's integrating Germanborn Heinrich into the company or curtailing Benedetto's recklessness and criminal tendencies. At times though I got the impression they'd shoehorned the romantic subplot in to emulate the success of the likes of The Notebook and other war films which featured heavy romantic elements.My recommendation for Fallen depends entirely on who I'm addressing. The diehard wardrama fans won't love it but it scratches the proverbial itch if you're looking for a decent WWII tale. If you're in it for the sweeping battleshots and hyperrealistic war tale though it falls short. Conversely wider audiences will enjoy the dramatics and possibly appreciate a war movie that doesn't overly focus on blood and guts.Tighter editing would have been nice and the screenplay probably looked better on paper than screen. It certainly isn't anything new for the Battle of the Bulge.But Fallen Not Forgotten in the end is enjoyable enough to warrant getting past the mishandled opener.".

	schema:headline " A fine patriotic World War II film but not from unpatriotic Hollywood";
	schema:reviewBody "Most people my age remember when Hollywood was populated by patriotic Americans making war movies that guess what! were proAmerican and today's pathetic bundle of antiAmerican propaganda spinners were not even in nightmare visions of the future. Today we rely on independent filmmakers for patriotic films.I have to write this review because of the wealth of misinformation on this website.First the movie focuses on several 4 American guys fighting the Battle of the Bulge not about one man's experience.Second there are plenty of combat scenes. The film is loaded with combat scenes how could anybody not notice and they are better and more convincing for example than Steven Spielberg's famous but silly opening scenes in Saving Private Ryan.Third some have written about World War II in Oregon. This is an amazing viewpoint. Do not such writers know a that almost all World War II movies were filmed in California not Europe or Asia and 2 that Oregon in winter strongly resembles the part of Belgium where the Battle of the Bulge took place.There is a part of the film that seeks  like hundreds of other films  to perpetuate the idea that World War II was about the Jews. It was not. The war was about the invasions of France Czechoslovakia Poland Austria the bombing of London  lots of things.There is no point in the film where moral equivalence comes into play seeking to make the GI's and the Nazi army equal. The Germans are and were the bad guys.I'm very glad to praise this fine film and recommend it. It's much better than any of 2010's bloated boring highbudget movies  and a credit to filmmaking.One small nitpick In a scene where the homefolk are listening to war news on the radio WOR is broadcasting NBC. Not so Mcgee! WOR was the original and long running affiliate of the great Mutual Network".

	onyx:emotionText "Most people my age remember when Hollywood was populated by patriotic Americans making war movies that guess what! were proAmerican and today's pathetic bundle of antiAmerican propaganda spinners were not even in nightmare visions of the future. Today we rely on independent filmmakers for patriotic films.I have to write this review because of the wealth of misinformation on this website.First the movie focuses on several 4 American guys fighting the Battle of the Bulge not about one man's experience.Second there are plenty of combat scenes. The film is loaded with combat scenes how could anybody not notice and they are better and more convincing for example than Steven Spielberg's famous but silly opening scenes in Saving Private Ryan.Third some have written about World War II in Oregon. This is an amazing viewpoint. Do not such writers know a that almost all World War II movies were filmed in California not Europe or Asia and 2 that Oregon in winter strongly resembles the part of Belgium where the Battle of the Bulge took place.There is a part of the film that seeks  like hundreds of other films  to perpetuate the idea that World War II was about the Jews. It was not. The war was about the invasions of France Czechoslovakia Poland Austria the bombing of London  lots of things.There is no point in the film where moral equivalence comes into play seeking to make the GI's and the Nazi army equal. The Germans are and were the bad guys.I'm very glad to praise this fine film and recommend it. It's much better than any of 2010's bloated boring highbudget movies  and a credit to filmmaking.One small nitpick In a scene where the homefolk are listening to war news on the radio WOR is broadcasting NBC. Not so Mcgee! WOR was the original and long running affiliate of the great Mutual Network";

	schema:reviewBody "DESTRY RIDES AGAIN is set in the hopelessly corrupt little town of Bottleneck presided over as it is by the ruthless landgrabber and card shark Kent Brian Donlevy and his sexy partnerincrime Frenchy Marlene Dietrich. Sheriffs don't last long in this town particularly since Mayor Slade Samuel S. Hinds is in cahoots with Kent and his flock of flunkies. After doing away with Sheriff Keyhole Slade appoints the hapless town drunk Washington Dimsdale Charles Winninger to be the new Sheriff. 'Wash' cleans up his act and hopes to reenact the past glory he had under his boss Sheriff Destry by calling in Destry's son Tom James Stewart to be his deputy. To his horror Tom is a mildmannered kind of guy tall and gangling but with a tendency to lapse into little stories of people he knows. Even worse Tom has an aversion to guns his father having been shot in the back in spite of being wellknown for going about guns ablazing and takes out his frustrations by carving of all things napkin rings. It doesn't seem likely that 'Wash' is going to clean up Bottleneck with a deputy like Tom but clean it up they will with the aid of Frenchy who falls quickly for Tom and henpecked comic wannabe cowboy Boris Mischa Auer who is appointed second deputy. The film is truly a great ride from beginning to end thoroughly engaging funny and yet touching as well. You're never quite sure what to expect but whatever it is you're never disappointed. First of all you don't get stock charactersTom Destry is as atypical a Western hero as you can get as he wanders down the streets of Bottleneck carving napkin rings and using charm instead of guns most of the time! to get things done his way. Secondly as can be expected from a hero who doesn't believe in guns there aren't all that many scenes of gunplay. Oh sure there's a pretty cool shootout at the end but that's quickly foiled by Frenchy's clever marshalling of the women of Bottleneck and you get the impression from the film that stock action scenes with plenty of guns and bodies falling from incredible heights just aren't the point of DESTRY RIDES AGAIN and that's a point in its favour. Finally there isn't a pat Hollywood ending either. There's a happy ending of course but it's bittersweet. I was fully expecting Frenchy and Tom to get together at the very end cue fadeout etc. etc. They do get together that goes without saying. But again this occurs in a way that one simply doesn't expect right until it actually happens. This film always keeps you guessing but also continually entertained.You really couldn't get a better or more appropriate cast than this one too... of the supporting cast Charles Winninger plays his bumbling halfdrunk but principled character of Town DrunkSheriff Dimsdale perfectly. Mischa Auer as well is endearing as Boris from when he loses his pants to Frenchy on a bet through to his determination to be a great second deputy sheriff in exchange for Tom Destry's extra pants. But the two leads are fabulous as well the topbilled Marlene Dietrich is sultry sexy but also cute and performs some great numbers in the saloon the best of which would be 'The Boys In The Back Room' but the opener 'Little Joe' would be a close runnerup. Still the one thing Dietrich will be remembered for from this film and with good cause is that barroom catfight with Una Merkel who plays Lily Belle. Catty vicious and absolutely hilarious Dietrich really goes all out in a slapdown knockout fight with Merkel then proceeds to throw everything imaginable in Stewart's direction with such fire and enthusiasm that you can't help laughing at and loving her at the same time. Speaking of Stewarthe gives a fantastic performance in the role of Thomas Jefferson Destry. His laidback way of ambling across the screen his slow assured drawl his expressive face all combine together to bring Destry to life. It isn't any actor who can pull off the apparent humiliation Stewart's character must face such as descending from his carriage to face the folk of Bottleneck for the first time carrying a canary cage and a parasol over his head. But just as he pulls off the comedic scenes his dramatic scenes are effective as well particularly his final scenes with both Washington and Frenchy. Most importantly you can believe that Tom is a goodnatured charmer as he's meant to be but not a simpleminded dolt.DESTRY RIDES AGAIN isn't just an absolutely cracking Western from its barroom brawls and sassy ladies right down to its grand shootout finaleit's also a sly tongueincheek homage to and spoof of the entire genre and its stock of characters from the roguish ne'erdowell Kent to the bumbling sheriff Washington Dimsdale. It's a feelgood film with romance comedy and action blended into a Western setting and is most certainly one of the best films of the 1930s and one of the best I've ever seen. A classic!".

His career kicked into high gear with Destry Ridges Again and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. From just a good leading man these films guaranteed Jimmy Stewart screen immortality.Destry was equally an important film for Marlene Dietrich. Her career had come to a standstill and she had been let go from her original American studio Paramount. A whole lot of people said she was through in Hollywood but Marlene showed them all.This is the second film adaption of the story a 1932 version was done by Tom Mix one of his last films and one of his few sound ones. This one however is THE standard version.Destry Rides Again was directed by George Marshall who was very good at mixing humor and drama to make some great films. This one is probably Marshall's greatest. Among Hollywood directors from the studio age he is sadly forgotten. The town of Bottleneck is one rip roaring place with a whole lot of promiscuous shooting going on. It's a pretty corrupt place run by saloon owner Brian Donlevy and his stooge mayor Samuel S. Hinds. When the sheriff is killed they 'elect' the town drunk Charles Winninger as the new sheriff.But Winninger who was a deputy sheriff at one time sends for the son of his former boss Thomas Jefferson Destry played by Jimmy Stewart. Destry makes quite an entrance into Bottleneck running afoul of saloon entertainer Marlene Dietrich. His arrival in Bottleneck up to his first encounter with Marlene are some of the funniest moments ever put on screen.Destry Rides Again gave Marlene one of her classic ballads See What the Boys in the Backroom Will Have as well as Little Joe the Wrangler. Who would ever have thought that the girl from Germany would wind up having one of her most noted film roles as a western saloon entertainer. But Marlene created an indelible character so much so that Mel Brooks and Madeline Kahn gave her a real heartfelt tribute in Blazing Saddles. I'll bet Marlene enjoyed that one also.James Stewart did not return to the western genre until Winchester 73 and Broken Arrow eleven years later. But this was one great film to make a debut in that film art form.You won't indulge in any promiscuous shooting while Destry is on the job.".

Our last sheriff Joe King disappeared real mysterious like and the mayor Samuel S. Hinds who's in cahoots with Kent appointed the town drunk Charles Winninger as the new sheriff.

A hardboiled Dietrich with a difference rouged but rugged who fights  yells yodels her way  sharpnailed to love.This is a classic Hollywood Western  it turns out to be a mixture of action  fights shootouts and humor.

I know people who simply will not watch a black and white film or an old movie. Well in my opinion this movie has a story that is thoroughly enjoyable and stands up well even today. It has an excellent cast not only in the lead roles but also in the supporting cast. So anyone who might not watch this film because it is not color is cheating themselves of an enjoyable film. And for any who just don't watch a film just because it is old may I suggest that if you haven't seen a movie it is new for you. As for myself I just did not endorse this film but I put my money where my mouth is and forked over the greenbacks not once but twice. I got the film on VHS and enjoyed it thoroughly. Upon finding it newly released on DVD I got it again. The picture quality in the DVD is great. I'm a little surprised that there were no special feature extras included since these kind of bonuses are so common with DVD releases. But I suppose that would be like criticising a painting because of a lack of a fancy frame. This film certainly deserved to sweep the Oscars and probably would have in a different year. 'Nuff sed.".

But the fixtures of this kind of movie were well in placethe barroom brawl the bad men and their guns the good sheriff coming to the rescue the sweet untainted woman and the quasiwhorehouse type woman and of course the final shootout. It's all here. And it's a wild ride done with subtlety a difficult combination to pull off.It's fun to see this movie and then compare to the later generation of takeoffs and spoofs that take themselves much more seriouslythe spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s. These too used all the clichs of the Western to make an amusing reference to those types. The reason why those movies worked so well and why Destry does too is that these are attractive archetypes. We see ourselves in these people somehow and yet not too closely. We identify with them especially Jimmy Stewart the sheriff and Marlene Dietrich the bad woman with a good heart who can sing too and yet know they are all artifice just as in a play. The illusion of reality is damped down by the excess and the fun and the obvious exaggerations.As for director George Marshall he's a hardened Hollywood veteran most famous perhaps for a long string of golf movies yes golf the sport. But his expertise and his willingness to go for broke with scenes involving dozens or even hundreds of people and to use the camera vigorously and to realize he had two of the greatest actors he could ask for Stewart toward the beginning of his career and Dietrich still a great star though cast against her normal romanticized type from the early 1930s is phenomenal. You'll shake your head and laugh at the same time.In fact it is the chemistry of the two stars that gives the movie surprising depth. It's not just a farce. It talks about pacifism just as World War II is brewing. And it suggests something about true love as much as carnal attraction. All while the world is exploding around the two leads almost literally as you'll see. And whatever might happen on screen by the end it's fun to know that the two had a real affair offscreen with some hush hush scandal to follow years later.Watch this and laugh and maybe even cry a little.

The town's saloon owner Kent and his singer girlfriend Frenchy essentially run the town and profit at the expense of other families by cheating residents out of their properties in poker games. Though Frenchy is a commanding confident and feisty character it is obvious that Destry's arrival causes her to feel differently about the business she and Kent had done. Destry's arrival is the most interesting part of the movie in my opinion because his courtesy in carrying the parasol and pet bird for another woman causes him to appear 'weak' in the eyes of the mocking townspeople. Eventually Destry the adamant antigun advocate shows off his gun slinging skills to a couple of rowdy drunk men and captures the awe of everyone in attendance. Destry and Frenchy both develop significantly over the course of the film to be dynamic catalysts for the film's conclusion. In regards to theme this movie wrestles with the question What is the law? and more importantly What side is the law on? Destry quickly discovers that the mayor and Kent collude to hold real jurisdiction over Bottleneck while they put a sheriff in charge who is easy to manipulate.

A film of this type though is only as good as its villain and thankfully Brian Donlevy steps up to the plate with a suitable grumpy sneer it's a fine performance from a very undervalued performer.Directed by the highly experienced George Marshall Destry Rides Again is chock full of the elements that make a good family film even better than it should be jokes a plenty goodies and baddies songs and quality slices of drama all combine here to make this a very entertaining and rewarding picture indeed.

	schema:reviewBody "When the Sheriff of Bottleneck asks one too many questions about the legitimacy of Kent's card games he winds up dead and the new sheriff is the town drunk. The corrupt forces behind Bottleneck think that things will be just how they like it from now on but don't figure that the drunk will call in help in the form of a deputy Tom Destry  son of the famous lawman. However Destry Jr turns out to not only be against carrying guns but also be softspoken and good humour  not characteristics that Wash hoped for in his deputy. However with a culture of silence gun crime widespread and the town in the grip of the sultry and dangerous Frenchy can Destry make an impact? Although I always find it difficult to watch large sections of this film without recalling the hilarious Blazing Saddles I do enjoy the mix of comedy drama and dark content in this film and find it eminently enjoyable. From the very start the tone is raucous and comic and the addition of Stewart only serves to make it seem even more whimsical. And for the most part it is just like this  broad fun with gentle laughs and goodnatured playing all round. This is fine and makes for a fun film but it is the extra stuff that makes it gain momentum towards the end and not just end up like a big puff of nothing much the drama is tense the writing is brave and the action is pretty enjoyable. It isn't amazing stuff though and it could be argued that the sudden rush of blood at the end doesn't sit that well with the relaxed pace it had early on but for me it phased from one aspect into the other pretty well and the conclusion actually made it feel weightier than the majority had actually been.The cast make it work of course despite the risks taken. With events as they were at the time Dietrich was considered a risk but she pays off well and is a great central character providing laughs and some real energy in her character and the musical numbers. Stewart has great chemistry with her even if the script didn't make their relationship totally convincing. He plays his usual type of role but he does it very well and he mixes his gentle comic touch with Dietrich's bawdry style. The support cast are roundly great and people like Auer Winninger Donlevy and others all make sure that the film is not being carried by the two leads but is rather a group effort.Overall a great comedy western that has more to it than you think. Unlikely to win over younger viewers weaned on constant action or big grossout laughs but it is an effortless watch with gentle humour great musical numbers some tension good action great acting and a whole experience that has an enjoyable swagger to it while also winking to the audience for the most part.".

Although I always find it difficult to watch large sections of this film without recalling the hilarious Blazing Saddles I do enjoy the mix of comedy drama and dark content in this film and find it eminently enjoyable. From the very start the tone is raucous and comic and the addition of Stewart only serves to make it seem even more whimsical. And for the most part it is just like this  broad fun with gentle laughs and goodnatured playing all round. This is fine and makes for a fun film but it is the extra stuff that makes it gain momentum towards the end and not just end up like a big puff of nothing much the drama is tense the writing is brave and the action is pretty enjoyable. It isn't amazing stuff though and it could be argued that the sudden rush of blood at the end doesn't sit that well with the relaxed pace it had early on but for me it phased from one aspect into the other pretty well and the conclusion actually made it feel weightier than the majority had actually been.The cast make it work of course despite the risks taken. With events as they were at the time Dietrich was considered a risk but she pays off well and is a great central character providing laughs and some real energy in her character and the musical numbers. Stewart has great chemistry with her even if the script didn't make their relationship totally convincing. He plays his usual type of role but he does it very well and he mixes his gentle comic touch with Dietrich's bawdry style. The support cast are roundly great and people like Auer Winninger Donlevy and others all make sure that the film is not being carried by the two leads but is rather a group effort.Overall a great comedy western that has more to it than you think. Unlikely to win over younger viewers weaned on constant action or big grossout laughs but it is an effortless watch with gentle humour great musical numbers some tension good action great acting and a whole experience that has an enjoyable swagger to it while also winking to the audience for the most part.";

Because I saw this film at a very young age it's probably the only reason why I recall this film with fondness. Viewed as an adult THE LOST CONTINENT is a fairly standard science fiction movie. The film moves along a good pace except for the overly long rock climbing sequence mentioned several times in this forum by the films detractors. The stop motion dinosaurs are only moderately interesting. The effects seem to have been done by effects men who lacked experience in employing this technique. Note how the dinosaurs in most scenes only move one limb at a time and appear not to have been anchored down tight enough. However despite the faults in the stop motion animation in this film I will give the films producers credit for at least employing this technique instead giving us tired looking put upon photographically enlarged lizards. The films cast is acceptable but no one gives a performance that would win any major awards either. Hillary Brooke was given top billing in the films ads but her role here is minor so minor that her scenes are often cut from many of the TV prints I have seen. Whit Bissel who soon become a stalwart in fifties science fiction movies is cast in a superfluous role as a scientist who falls off the mountain in a surprisingly effective scene where he falls into a mist before our band of merry mountain climbers encounter the dinosaurs. John Hoyt has the best part a the Russian exile scientist who becomes the films hero in that it is rather unusual for a fifties film to have a Russian as a hero. However all the characters except for Hoyt's are stereotypes but the not kind that was typically found in fifties science fiction movies. Thats because the typical fifties science fiction movie characters had not yet been invented. Instead THE LOST CONTINENT features the kind of stereotype characters found in war movies.The best part of THE LOST CONTINENT is use of green tinting in the scenes when the explorers are on the dinosaur inhabited mountain top. I had to chance to see the tinted version and thought it to give the film an interesting look. Its a shame so many black and white films that included tinting or colour sequences are shown only in black and white today.THE LOST CONTINENT isn't a bad film really I can't really sight anything except for the overly long rock climbing sequence thats done all that bad that would make someone dislike it nor does anything stand out as exceptionally well done to make this film anyones favorite either. Its simply undistinguished. It is just another film I don't think anyone back in 1951 saw this film and raved about it to their friends but I don't think anyone walked out on this film demanding their money back either. THE LOST CONTINENT is like a great number of movies the kind one sits through with only mild interest and enthusiasm.".

	schema:headline " Some solid performances and ideas undercut by uneven pacing and offkey elements";
	schema:reviewBody "Lost Continent turned out to be a reasonably solid film which was a surprise for me since I knew A it was directed by megahack Sam Neufeld and Bit was an early target for Mystery Science Theater 3000 in their 2nd season when they really hit their stride.So let's get the bad stuff out of the way first  rock climbing Sid Melton and unconvincing dinosaur animation. Anyone who has seen LC all the way through knows that the movie stops dead in the second act and subjects the viewer to endless scenes of the characters scrambling up a mountainside on their way to the crashed atomic rocket at the top. I am sure that the point was to help the viewer experience the struggle and fatigue of an 'epic' journey...but the climbing scenes are staged in a plodding pedestrian manner that kills any interest the first 20 minutes managed to generate. It's worse than watching paint dry. Things actually get moving a little once the crew makes it to the top but man...rock climbing was sloooooow going.2nd Sid Melton. I know that Melton got a lot of work in various TV shows and movies calling for comedy relief. And I remember he was pretty good at times on Danny Thomas etc. But he's just not funny to my modern sensibilities...in fact he's really irritating. His performance pulls the movie down a couple of rating points all by itself. His role is pure cardboard his dialog is completely lame and he basically does sadsack military enlisted man schtick here purely on autopilot. I kept praying for his immediate and painful death in LC. Then again I'm not sure Elvis channeling Jim Carey could have saved this part so I don't want to trash poor Sid too hard. I hope he's happily retired and living on his residuals somewhere.3rd the dinosaur animation. I am sure this was the biggest expense in the film but once you've seen Ray Harryhausen you can't tolerate stuff like this anymore. There are no credits for the animation sequences in the credits so it's possible that the producers and the animators felt the same way. It was also kind of irritating to have a brontosaurusapatosaur attack the party and try to eat Hugh Beaumont when any six year old could tell you that the bronto was a gentle timid vegetarian. Apparently Neufeld didn't have any six year olds around to act as consultants.As for the good everyone else here does a workmanlike job of getting their dialog over and filling out their stereotyped roles. I'd never seen Romero in a straight dramatic role before and I have to admit he's pretty dashing. He has great hair and he knows how to rock the mustache. If you were looking for someone to do the Errol Flynn role in your movie Romero would be an obvious choice. Whit Bissell and Beaumont are their usual dignified genial selves and the guy who plays the Russian rocket scientist brings a certain humanity and nobility to his lines that a lot of other actors might not.And c'mon...it's rockets and dinosaurs and manly men on a manly adventure how could this movie's intended audience sleepy male adolescents NOT love it? As I said MST3000 covered this one early on...if fact I remember that the episode where they tackled Lost Continent was the first MST I ever saw. And yes the movie deserved all the barbs japes and witticisms they tossed at it but it still has a certain quality that elevates it far above most of their other fare...even if it hasn't aged too well. But let's be fair...how well do you thing Cameron's Titanic will hold up to viewers in 2056??".

I am sure this was the biggest expense in the film but once you've seen Ray Harryhausen you can't tolerate stuff like this anymore. There are no credits for the animation sequences in the credits so it's possible that the producers and the animators felt the same way. It was also kind of irritating to have a brontosaurusapatosaur attack the party and try to eat Hugh Beaumont when any six year old could tell you that the bronto was a gentle timid vegetarian. Apparently Neufeld didn't have any six year olds around to act as consultants.As for the good everyone else here does a workmanlike job of getting their dialog over and filling out their stereotyped roles. I'd never seen Romero in a straight dramatic role before and I have to admit he's pretty dashing. He has great hair and he knows how to rock the mustache. If you were looking for someone to do the Errol Flynn role in your movie Romero would be an obvious choice. Whit Bissell and Beaumont are their usual dignified genial selves and the guy who plays the Russian rocket scientist brings a certain humanity and nobility to his lines that a lot of other actors might not.And c'mon...it's rockets and dinosaurs and manly men on a manly adventure how could this movie's intended audience sleepy male adolescents NOT love it? As I said MST3000 covered this one early on...if fact I remember that the episode where they tackled Lost Continent was the first MST I ever saw. And yes the movie deserved all the barbs japes and witticisms they tossed at it but it still has a certain quality that elevates it far above most of their other fare...even if it hasn't aged too well. But let's be fair...how well do you thing Cameron's Titanic will hold up to viewers in 2056??";

	schema:headline " Amazing! A GOOD Sam Newfield movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "Sam Newfield was one of the if not THE most prolific directors in American film history. Counting features and tworeelers Newfield racked up close to 300 films in a career that started shortly after the turn of the century and ended in 1958. Newfield churned out movies so quickly and on such a regular basis that one studio he worked for PRC owned by his brother Sigmund tacked the names Sherman Scott and Peter Stewart on much of Newfield's output so it wouldn't look like one man was making almost all of PRC's product. As can be expected much of Newfield's work is of little or no importance his Buster Crabbe westerns for PRC in the '40s are especially worthless but every so often something would happen and Newfield would turn out a film that was coherent professionallooking and even gasp! entertaining. He was assigned by producer Sam Katzman to the Tim McCoy series of westerns for Puritan in the mid1930s and some of them are actually tidy little gemstight humorous wellstaged little examples of the best of the Bwestern. The Lost Continent is among Newfield's best workin fact it probably IS Newfield's best work. Working with a larger budget than he was usually accustomed to even given the fact that it was a cheapo Lippert production and given a stronger cast than he got in many of his films Newfield manages to do quite a good job with what he is given. The story an Air Force plane trying to recover a lost missile that has landed in what turns out to be a prehistoric jungle complete with dinosaurs is nothing much but Newfield's pacing is quite steady the dialogue isn't as mindnumbing as the usual Newfield extravaganza and he actually manages to generate some suspense a first for him with the Russian character played by John Hoyt is he or isn't he a Commie spy?. The crude stopmotion dinosaurs are cheesy and badly done but since they seem to have been thrown in at the last minute they don't really detract from the film all that much. If you're familiar with Sam Newfield's work this will be a revelation to you. If you're not check it out to see what is the best film in an otherwise almost completely undistinguished career.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lost Continent is an excellent low budget dinosaur adventure from 1951. Although we don't get to see any dinosaurs until the last half hour this is worth the wait.A party is sent to a South Seas island to search for a missing atomic rocket.  They eventually arrive there after a long flight and a lot of rock climbing.  While resting on the rock face one of the party sees an enlarged lizard but no one else believes him.   When they get there they discover an uncharted plateau where time has stood still.  It is tinted green.  On the plateau they battle a Brontosaurus some Triceratops and a Pterodactyl. These stopmotion monsters look quite impressive even though they are not done by Willis O'Brien or Ray Harryhausen.  The party eventually finds the rocket get the information they want off it and escape from the plateau which is then destroyed by an earthquake.This movie stars Cesar Romero and several familiar faces from 50's scifi movies  Whit Bissell Creature From the Black Lagoon John Hoyt When Worlds Collide and Hillary Brooke Invaders From Mars.  All play good parts.  The score in this movie is excellent throughout and the green tint looks good too.I had been after this movie for ages and was pleased when I obtained an NTSC copy.This is a must for fans of dinosaur movies and 1950's scifi.

The director did a pretty good job with what he had. With a slightly bigger budget the dinosaurs could've been made to look more believable. The dinosaur movements seem jerky and abnormal. The climbing sequences are okay and do tend to generate a bit of suspense. Once they reach the top of the mountain looking for the lost rocket things progress along rather nicely. I have seen this film in its original form and it appears that in new releases of this film a brief sequence is missing. After the Sid Melton character is partially eaten by a triceratops Sid barely alive asks Cesar Romero for a cigarette. Sid is given one and as Romero flicks his cigarette lighter the flame dies. Talk about symbolism. That scene appears to be missing from recent releases!".

	schema:headline " A sleeping pill in movie form";
	schema:reviewBody "Lost Continent which stars Caesar Romero and the dad from Leave it to Beaver is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Most of it can be described as filler and not very good filler at that. It begins as did so many lowbudget movies from the '50s with stock footage of a rocket launch. The rocket soon crashes in some unnamed county I think it's in South America but it might be the South Pacific or Africa and a team of scientists and military types are sent to retrieve it. No points for guessing that their plane immediately crashes in the middle of wherever it is they are.They find out from the few remaining natives that the rocket landed on a nearby plateau which they proceed to climb. Once on top they discover a lost world where dinosaurs roam and uranium paves the streets so to speak. Dinosaurs jungles treacherous climbs and even a massive unexplained cataclysm at the end this is the kind of material that pulp magazines and Bmovies thrive on. Lost Continent has all the ingredients of a dumb but exciting adventure movie. You wouldn't expect this to be Oscar material but you'd think there'd be a lot of action.Alas Lost Continent fails to meet even these minimal expectations. Most shots involve the team members making small talk slogging through jungles or climbing. Oh how they climb. The movie is only 80 minutes long and a full thirty minutes of that is spent getting up the cliffs. This could have been dangerous or exciting but that would have taken too much money. So instead we get the Captain Video effect in which the actors climb the same fake ledges over and over again while the cameras studiously avoid any breathtaking vertical shots which would reveal that they're actually at ground level. Even when someone falls to his death we only see the reaction of the companion who failed to save him.You'd think the dinosaurs would spice things up a bit but no. We get cheap Claymation dinos that are less detailed than the ones in King Kong filmed twenty years earlier. In fact I have a sneaking suspicion that the scenes with the dinosaurs are yet more stock footage lifted from other films. This would explain why we never see the dinos and the actors in the same frame even through rear projection. And the Brontosaurus looks suspiciously like the one in 1925's The Lost World. So no there isn't a single bit of excitement generated by the dinosaur attacks.The movie is further hampered by the lack of any real acting. True I wasn't expecting the actors to be convincing but I thought there might be some campy overacting. Instead the cast performs as if they were on downers. Every line sounds like they were reading it off the script while fighting drowsiness. These guys are more wooden than a cigar store Indian. They get over their colleague's death in less than a minute and pronouncements that they're running out of food and may never get home alive are delivered with no more urgency than if they were missing an episode of House. I suspect this is a reflection of the cast's total apathy. I also suspect that Lost Continent was made just so the distributors would have something to show on the bottom of a doublebill.If you've read many of my previous reviews you've probably guessed by now that I cheated and watched the MST3K version. I was pretty good as Joel and the 'bots had a field day pointing out the utter lack of action. This version is worth checking out for a few laughs. The original is worthless except as a sleep aid.".

In fact I have a sneaking suspicion that the scenes with the dinosaurs are yet more stock footage lifted from other films. This would explain why we never see the dinos and the actors in the same frame even through rear projection. And the Brontosaurus looks suspiciously like the one in 1925's The Lost World. So no there isn't a single bit of excitement generated by the dinosaur attacks.The movie is further hampered by the lack of any real acting. True I wasn't expecting the actors to be convincing but I thought there might be some campy overacting. Instead the cast performs as if they were on downers. Every line sounds like they were reading it off the script while fighting drowsiness. These guys are more wooden than a cigar store Indian. They get over their colleague's death in less than a minute and pronouncements that they're running out of food and may never get home alive are delivered with no more urgency than if they were missing an episode of House. I suspect this is a reflection of the cast's total apathy. I also suspect that Lost Continent was made just so the distributors would have something to show on the bottom of a doublebill.If you've read many of my previous reviews you've probably guessed by now that I cheated and watched the MST3K version. I was pretty good as Joel and the 'bots had a field day pointing out the utter lack of action. This version is worth checking out for a few laughs. The original is worthless except as a sleep aid.";

What did I miss? Sure it's not the worst movie I've ever seen but come on! Lost Continent is about as exciting as watching grass grow or watching paint dry or any other tired old clich you can think of. It's deathly dull! It seems that at least half of the movie is devoted to watching the characters either climb a mountain or just walk around. As a viewer you get to watch all six characters going over the same boulder  and doing so very slowly  and without any tension or suspense  and often without any background music. And when our group of intrepid explorers isn't climbing over the same stagebound rock for the fourth time they're walking through a fake looking jungle. Actually they're not really walking as it seems each time the camera cuts to them they're taking a fifteen minute break. How exciting is that! They don't do much and nothing much happens to them. Twothirds of the movie is over before the first dinosaur makes an appearance. I realize that Lost Continent was made with a very small budget but these dinosaurs are terrible. Movies made 20 years previous had better looking stop motion special effects.But as I wrote earlier Lost Continent is far from the worst movie I've seen. The acting alone keeps this thing from being a total waste of time. The name actors in Lost Continent are Cesar Romero and Hugh Beaumont. Both do a decent enough job but they're not given much to stretch their acting abilities. Also present as he was in seemingly everything made in the 50s and 60s is Whit Bissell. The name might not be recognizable but most fans of older films would be familiar with the face and voice.".
