	schema:reviewBody "Please see also my review of The Tiger of Eschnapur.The Indian Tomb was the second part of a pair of pictures directed by Fritz Lang his first German productions since the 1930s adapted from a screenplay he had himself worked on nearly thirty years earlier. The two of them should really be considered one whole work as much as were his twopart epics from the silent era Dr Mabuse Der Spieler 1922 and Die Nibelungen 1924. These earlier opuses were among the most prestigious works made not only in Germany but anywhere in the world at the time. However this Indian diptych of the late50s a product of the drastically different postwar German film industry looks like some cheap and cheerful Euro Bflick at least at first glance.The Indian Tomb and its forerunner The Tiger of Eschnapur certainly bear many hallmarks of a trashy protoexploitation feature. The Indian characters are played rather unconvincingly by Europeans in brownface the special effects are often laughable stuffed tigers in part one which are outdone by plastic cobras in part two a bit of partial female nudity and a fastpaced plot of action and romance with more than of a few plot holes imaginationstretchers and complete suspensions of logic  the most stupendous of which has to be the unexplained concept that lepers are actually zombies. To make matters worse the two pictures were cut down into one movie by American International Pictures Roger Corman's distributor and for years this was all Englishspeaking audiences could see of them. Today however we are lucky enough to have fullyrestored versions of both parts available to us including a subtitled German version which is far preferable to the atrocious English dub assuming you can get over the illogic of Indians speaking to each other in German. Now at last we are able to rediscover and reevaluate Fritz Lang's final masterpiece.On closer inspection these two pictures are not quite so low in their values and appeal as one might think. For a start the fact that Europeans play Indians is not really so different to westerners playing Arabs in Lawrence of Arabia. And there would be female nudity in Blowup and that is considered arty! The cast while not exactly awardworthy are uniformly decent with the standout being Walter Reyer's eerily underplayed portrayal of the unbalanced Maharajah. There's a fabulous musical score by Gerhard Becker and although admittedly the invented Uncle Pat song sounds more like a Gregorian chant than a Irish folk ballad when Becker interpolates it into the main score on sweeping strings it makes a wonderful aching love theme. The plot too is more than just your typical fightaminute nobrainer. While far from realistic its riproaring adventure has many strands to it such as the political infighting of the fictional eastern province and the Maharajah's descent into jealousyfuelled madness. It is of course aspects like this that would have been ripe for the chop when the pictures were reedited in the US.And now let us turn to the contribution of Herr Lang himself. Although he spent most of his twenty years in Hollywood making cheap and sometimes nasty Bflicks he never lost the flair and professionalism of his early German career at which time he was rightly regarded as one of the most important talents at UFA studios. He was always at his best presenting adventure stories tinged with a slightly dark paranoid streak which while unfortunately being the subject of auterist psychobabble mainly serves to heighten the sense of danger and excitement. As in The Tiger of Eschnapur the vast angular sets are given prominence with shots composed so that the walls seem to press in on all sides. There's often a passage or open door at the back of the room suggesting that the heroes could be crept up upon from behind at any moment. Early on there's a shot where Walter and Irene are in their quarters and a net curtain covers one corner of the frame. By cinematic convention this looks like a pointofview shot which gives this unnerving feeling that the couple are being watched. The carefully orchestrated action finale in which all the various elements  the rebellion Harald's escape the flooding of the catacombs  reach a crescendo is reminiscent of the climactic scenes of Metropolis and Die Nibelungen. It is really such a good thing that Lang the man who brought our dreams and our nightmares to the screen with such vibrancy did not end his career in lowerend Hollywood productions. His Indian epic is a glorious and worthy tribute to his silentera heyday.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers. The Indian Tomb actually titled The Tomb of Love in the opening credits of the Fantomas DVD release is part two of Fritz Lang's Indian Epic and I have to say that this and Part One The Tiger of Eschnapur are quickly become two of my favorites of this director despite their deficiencies. As I said in my notes about Tiger this two part production has a lot going for it not the least of which are the remarkable locations cinematography Langian screen compositions and costumes. This is eye candy to the max with one amazing image after another but its modern day Adam and Eve storyline and supernatural microcosm are also noteworthy. Part One set the stage pitted the characters against one another and in Part Two the rivalry between architect Harald Berger and the Maharaja Chandra and the political intrigue finally explode in full force. In Part Two the pacing also picks up. Speaking of that I must mention that the first time I watched both films I found them rather slow and uneventful particularly Part Two  but something about them brought me back and about a year later I rewatched them. The second viewing was a very different experience. I saw things I completely missed the first time around. The clever irony the emphasis on the spiritual world the correlation of animals to the main characters and the Gods the existence of a subversive underworld and the interplay of opposing forces all came into focus in the most poetic fashion. On first viewing I think I preferred the first part but I now feel they are equally strong. In Part Two the plot to overthrow the prince and the arcs of the key characters particularly Paget's Seetha character carried more weight on second viewing. As someone else said the films are structured in a cliff hanger serial style not unlike the Indiana Jones films. Unlike Spielberg however Lang's Indian Epic isn't afraid to take its characters seriously. There is humor but the romance of character locale theme and story take a front seat. There is more going on here than just a fantastic adventure. At the end of Part One the hero Berger and the Indian dancer Seetha beaten by the sun in the desert collapse and Berger shoots his gun towards the sun in an act of defiance against God. This theme of defiance towards God develops throughout Part Two. And Part Two also has Debra Paget's erotic dance of death with an unfortunately fake snake. As I mentioned in my comments about Tiger Paget basically runs away with the whole show and her erotic dance in this part certainly adds to it. With her many jeweled costumes contrasted by her dark makeup she never radiated on screen more beautifully. She is truly one of the great faces of that era. Her scant gilded costume is very risqu for 1960 and I can't image it didn't get censored back then. Yet the dance is beyond erotic for it also intelligently expands the drama of the story. Lang's compositions speak volumes about the characters and an entire essay could be written about them. Suffice to say even if the meaning of the shots don't hit you you'll still be blown away by the exquisite colors production design and costumes. The use of white is astounding. And let me mention the music by Michel Michelet. It's quite a stylish score rich with exotic instrumentation Indian marches and fanciful dances. Like the exquisite images the score adds considerably to the alluring atmosphere. If you're a Fritz Lang fan and you don't mind silent film pacing you're probably of an age and mindset to appreciate this epic. It made me wonder what Lang would have done with Metropolis had he shot it in 3strip Technicolor. There are some deficiencies I must mention however. Some of the visual effects are less than satisfactory the aforementioned snake being the worst offender and a few of the sets look like sets. Also some of the Indian characters Chandra for example are not Indians but white actors in makeup. Such was the times but even as recently as 1982's Gandi white actors Ben Kingsley were playing non whites. Nevertheless the broad strokes performances work well in this kind of adventure. The Fantomas DVD of Lang's Indian Epic has both German and English language available. Even though the dubbing is regrettable the English version is preferable unless you speak German since the subtitles avert your eyes from the spectacular imagery. If you approach this with an open mind Lang's Indian Epic will sweep you away to a wondrous world.".

I wonder how both films were ever condensed into a mere ninety minutes for domestic release? What an extraordinary feat in itself! I can see the influence on Speilburg and Luca quite clearly. This does have numerous external similarities to TEMPLE OF DOOM as well as several motifs common to other Lang films.There are some amusing blunders. The Priest talks about Allah then a few scenes later cautions that THE GODS will be displeased. Islam is monothestic!There was a line uttered by the Priest There will be darkness over Eschanpur. That would have been a most intriguing title nothing so bland as THE Indian TOMB and would have also linked TIGERS OF ESCHANAPUR to this film. Both were released in that one 90 minute Americanized version JOURNEY TO THE LOST CITY. As far as I could tell from this half the city was far from lost! The Maharajah is proclaimed as RAJ of this state and that master of the realms of YaddaYadda and so on. I got out my map of India and was easily able to locate the areas he mentioned. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it highly especially to those who love a good rollicking adventure.

	schema:reviewBody "I was wary of purchasing Fantoma's 2Disc Set of Fritz Lang's Indian Epic after being somewhat let down by the 1921 Silent original coscripted by Lang himself and also its lessthanstellar reputation. For this reason when the second part of the saga turned up on Italian TV a couple of years ago I decided to check it out just the same so as to get an inkling of what to expect! I recall thinking it pretty kitschy and unworthy of Lang's enormous talent but Fantoma's sale through their website of their entire DVD catalog a few months back made it an irresistible acquisition! Well having now watched the entire saga with dialogue and in color as opposed to the rather static Silent version directed by Joe May  although hearing the Indiangarbed characters talking in German took some getting used to I was pleasantly surprised by how genuinely engaging and sheerly enjoyable it all was! Though it was sold as an epic production to the point of concluding ESCHNAPUR with the promise that Part II would feature greater thrills and even more spectacle at a time when such films were all the rage the saga was actually a pretty modest undertaking by eclectic and prolific German producer Artur Brauner. Despite the two films' exotic handsome look not least in the provocative dances of Debra Paget the budgetary constraints were painfully obvious in the special effects department especially the hilarious appearance of a 'ropey' cobra which is intended to 'test' the scantilyclad Miss Paget's faithfulness to the Maharajah!! All in all even if these films hardly constitute Lang's greatest work though he harbored an evident affection throughout his life for this particular tale which was originally conceived by his former wife Thea von Harbou they have great  and enduring  appeal for aficionados of oldfashioned seriallike adventure stories tinged with romance and mysticism.Even so while I don't subscribe to that school of thought myself there are some film critics Tom Gunning Jean Douchet and Pierre Rissient among them who think very highly of Lang's Indian diptych  the first considering it one of Lang's towering achievements and the last two numbering it among the ten greatest films of all time!!".

Some parts are done well such as the snakedance and the leper cave but they don't make up for long stretches of cardboard performances. The dialog the actors speak comes from a seventhrate comic book. The headpriest character has a ridiculously dubbed voice. Though directed in 1959 by the usually great Fritz Lang it more resembles a simplistic lesser adventure serial from the 1930s. Lang bombed if he thought he was producing a work for mature audiences.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the continuation of the story begun in Der Tiger von Eschnapur. This previous film ended with the lovers seemingly on death's doordying out in the desert after running away from the vengeful Maharaja. Now shortly after the pair are recaptured. The beautiful dancer Debra Paget is being forced to marry the nasty Maharaja and her lover Paul Hubschmid is being held in a dungeonbut she's been told he's dead. In the meantime the nice engineer's sister and brotherinlaw are virtual prisoners of the Maharaja's kindness and they soon realize the man knows more about Hubschmid than he's admitting. And during all this there are MANY folks conspiring to depose the Maharaja.The first film was escapist fun. This second one is dreary and slow during too much of the film. Part of it is that it's so talky. Part of it is the best part of the first film was the love storybut Paget and Hubschmid are separated almost this entire film and spend almost no time together. And part of it is that the script is rather bereft of actionat least until the end of the film. And when the fighting broke out it often seemed like it was being performed in slowmotion. Finally the Maharaja's change of heart at the end made no sense. Where did this come from considering it completely violated who he'd become in the film. The only really good thin about the film is Paget's sexy dancingwhich manages to perhaps be even more alluring than it was in the first film! Wow. But otherwise a rather limp followupand one that should have been fun.By the way I just about always watch films in their original language with subtitles. On a lark I decided to leave the English language version on for a few minutesjust to see if they were different. Oddly the leading man plays a Canadian in the English language version and he's a German in the original film! Perhaps with WWII only a decade and a half back they thought the film would be more marketable outside Germany if the man was a Canadian. I noticed a few other differences and turned it back to the German language version.".

Part of it is that it's so talky. Part of it is the best part of the first film was the love storybut Paget and Hubschmid are separated almost this entire film and spend almost no time together. And part of it is that the script is rather bereft of actionat least until the end of the film. And when the fighting broke out it often seemed like it was being performed in slowmotion. Finally the Maharaja's change of heart at the end made no sense. Where did this come from considering it completely violated who he'd become in the film. The only really good thin about the film is Paget's sexy dancingwhich manages to perhaps be even more alluring than it was in the first film! Wow. But otherwise a rather limp followupand one that should have been fun.By the way I just about always watch films in their original language with subtitles. On a lark I decided to leave the English language version on for a few minutesjust to see if they were different. Oddly the leading man plays a Canadian in the English language version and he's a German in the original film! Perhaps with WWII only a decade and a half back they thought the film would be more marketable outside Germany if the man was a Canadian. I noticed a few other differences and turned it back to the German language version.";

	schema:headline " TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was awful. Just as bad or worse than the first one. Same issues as the first one too. Acting was the worst thing about it. All the Indian characters were German with brown makeup to make them look Indian. It was extremely obvious in gorgeous Technicolor. The sole American leading lady was referred to as Indian but she had the features and coloring of Elizabeth Taylor. Apparently Lang thought having black hair and bare feet were the only things she needed to make her look Indian. The prince was terrible and often spoke forcefully for no reason. His makeup was very noticable and very phony looking. Jewelry was often too big for the actor wearing it and very phony looking also. The actors had very limited skills which often made them yell or glare at people regardless of what was taking place. Amateur mistakes.The brother of Berger is awful and often inexplicably shouts his lines. At one point his employer the prince removes some architectural models from the room and the brother throws a tantrum shouting and throwing things. The brother did not want to work on any designs anyway since his partner was missing so why he freaked out is unclear.In another scene he is instructed by the Prince to build a tomb. The prince angrily tells him all the precious gems he will have at his disposal. He's almost shouting the names of the gems as though the brother had protested the crappy materials. It makes no sense. The leading lady Seetha is only there for eye candy. Her skills are very limited. Perhaps because of this Lang always puts her in tight fitting tops without benefit of a bra and then will have her stretch and lean in the supposed guise of prayer to this or that goddess. At one point she does a sensual dance with a snake in which she is basically naked with a few week placed bits of cloth. She does a dance with a snake where she flexes her bare legs and even thrusts her hips suggestively over and over. For the time period this is beyond risque. Her face is exquisite to look at and this and the above dance are what make her bearable on screen. Her acting is tough to gauge because she's an American who didn't speak German so all her lines are dubbed by someone else. The writing isn't particularly good either. Characters do things that don't make sense and are never explained. Some of the plot devices are ridiculous and obvious. Like when the Prince steals a coat and smears it in blood to present to the hero's sister to prove he's been killed. This coat had been sewn recently by the hero's sister and had been stored in the closet of her room. Of course she knew it was a lie! Just lazy writing here. The prince is all upset because this woman he liked didn't like him? They barely knew each other and had no arrangement but he acts as though she'd cheated on him. It's far too weak a storyline to be believable as the prince isn't played like an ego maniac who expects everyone to bend to his will. He just wasn't the kind of guy to force a woman to be with him. In any case i gave it 3 stars for the beautiful color scenery and costumes. The acting story and directing warrant a big fat zero.".

It was one of director Fritz Lang's last works and it is nowhere near as famous as his early silent film classics. Still in terms of 1950 films it's amount the most known Germany has to offer. If you see the characters in this film they may not seem German to you but do not be fooled by the heavy makeup. The actors all are which you also see through the fact that their German is fluent and without accents. However the film is not as fluent. I was already not impressed by Lang's first film from that duology and this one here is at least as forgettable. The story tries to be ambitious from start to finish but it just never succeeds. The mediocre range from most of the actors including the core actors also does not help at all. It may be an acceptable film in terms of cinematography and the visual side but in terms of the story there is really nothing memorable to it. I also found it disappointing how they treated certain core aspects from the first film as if they are totally irrelevant now. Sad to see Lang go out on a low note. Not recommended.".

When the major studios discovered back in the late Seventies that indie horror flicks were cheap to make or just buy outright and distribute they started crankin' 'em out...by the DOZENS. Way back when THE EXORCIST turned the faucet on. The movies that would launch longterm franchises filled the tub. HALLOWEEN. Friday THE 13th. A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. And then the tub started spilling over. CHILD'S PLAY. THE HITCHER. THE LOST BOYS. NEAR DARK. FRIGHT NIGHT. Every company great and small started looking for the next EXORCIST ALIEN JAWS...the next big thing that would make millions. Enter Vestron Video. Vestron had started out doing some of the first directtovideo pictures ever made discovering that the market was HUGE. So big in fact that they started a movie division Vestron Pictures. Their strategy was simple make good if not great genre pics that would put asses in the seats that they could then distribute through the video arm later on. One of Vestron Pictures' first releases was a little number called WAXWORK. The plot of the old horror classic MYSTERY IN THE WAX MUSEUM was such a tried and true staple the studios kept falling back on it again and again finding fresh ways to retell the story. WAXWORK took a little different approach from the straightahead versions with a cast and a sensibility for horror that still screams Me Decade even today. Check out the victim's list Zach Galligan GREMLINS. Michelle Johnson BLAME IT ON RIO. Deborah Foreman VALLEY GIRL. Dana Ashbrook TWIN PEAKS. Miles O' Keefe TARZAN THE APE MAN. Then you throw in vets like David Warner Patrick McNee J. Kenneth Campbell John RhysDavies tap Bob Keen HELLRAISER to do make up effects and you have yourself an Eighties' classic!Like most films of the period it starts off with a group of bored young slackertypes looking for thrills something...ANYTHING that would be a little more exciting than getting high getting drunk getting laid well ALMOST more exciting than that and definitely more of a kick than going to college classes!They find it alright  in the form of an invitation to a brand new kind of museum. And this one is not your gardenvariety Madame Tussaud'swannabe. The wax figurines are so lifelike that the displays seem to draw you in...Well okay they DO draw you in. Here's the kicker the displays are dedicated to some of the most wellknown figures in the history of horror Dracula. The Wolfman. The Mummy. The Marquis de Sade. Reenactments of their most horrible deeds as they drained blood hacked and tore off limbs or crushed their helpless victims to death. Seeing the scenes gives patrons the feeling of being in the moment...but if they give in to the compulsion of stepping across the velvet rope around each display they will find themselves living in that moment...FOR REAL.And here's the REALLY bad news...if the monsters in each display kill you in the 'waxwork dimension' you become a permanent part of the display...FOREVER. So once that happens the situation couldn't get worse...could it?Oh yeah! The proprietor of the museum has a darker agenda than just dispatching troublesome teens as our heroes and victims discover with each person who 'disappears' into the museum. And seeing how that plan gets foiled is only part of the giggly gory fun.Remember that I mentioned that Bob Keen was the effects guy on this? He got his start as a modeler for movies like STAR WARS SUPERMAN and ALIEN cutting his teeth as he worked up to projects like HELLRAISER and THE UNHOLY. But he really served up his calling card with HELLRAISER and with this movie. Gorewise this is where the retelling of the Wax Museum story gets more interesting...because thanks to Bob the visuals go where they never had before.In a manner that would've made the suits at Universal flinch back in the Thirties Keen and writerdirector Anthony Hickox do away with the quaint violence that Famous Monsters used to wreak upon their poor victims. No camera pullaways here folks. Where somebody might only threaten to rip off your head and crap down your neck these boogeymen take that threat to its most intense extremes. No CGI fakery either. This was backintheday where almost all the effects were practical live and inyaface...the way we like it!Okay so the clothes the music the casting and even the acting squarely establish this as what could be considered a period piece for horror I guess. But like his colleagues David Schmoeller Ted Nicolaou Stuart Gordon and on occasion Charles Band himself Hickox knows how to get the action going and keep it that way. This is one of those gems that might've slipped under your radar but definitely worth seeking out hunting down and dragging back home to mount in your DVD library.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a small suburban town a group of college students visit a mysterious wax museum where they encounter several morbid displays all of which contain stock characters from the horror genre.Can't a girl get laid around here without being burned at the stake? Let me start by saying Anthony Hickox is a brilliant man. This movie was his first time as a writer and director and he did it perfectly. Going on to make a Warlock movie and a Hellraiser film he has established himself though still remains underappreciated.The film stars the kid from Gremlins and his group of friends who encounter the guy from The Omen who along with a midget and a Lurchlike butler manage a wax museum full of horrible characters. Dracula the Marquis de Sade a werewolf the mummy and nine other nasties. Well the museum offers a portal to each of these horrible worlds  but if you die in the portal you die in real life and become part of the museum.This film is brilliant because of the perfect combination of horror and comedy. You will get spraying blood mutilated flesh and a dismembered hand that lives on its own see Waxwork II for more on this and its connection to Evil Dead II. You will get a girl sexually aroused by being flogged sadomasochism goes hand in hand with horror. But yet it is funny. The midget is cute one of the kids is just weird and you should hear the way Dracula says steak tartar or the scene where the AARP old people raid the place.I could complain about the really odd plot and lack of sense. I mean there is a part where the origin of the museum is explained. Not only does this make little sense but there is no reason the man telling the story should know anything about it. Then there is the bit about the sculptures needing relics from their reallife bodies to become alive. Yet there are sculptures of The Fly the Invisible Man and a scene from a zombie film. These things never happened so how can they have real relics? But you know what? It is so much fun you just ignore things like this especially compared to the complete nonsense plot of the sequel or House II... Recommended? Heck yeah. Great comedy great horror great 80s film. Dana Ashbrook appears before the day of Twin Peaks. Oh and the professor from Sliders is in it too.My only concern is that allegedly the film was cut by the MPAA due to gore in the vampire sequence. I would love for that sequence to be put back together and a director's commentary never hurts. This film would be even better with more blood.".

	schema:reviewBody "Six souls must be gotten and given to various monsters in a magicalmystical waxwork museum in order for anarchy and evil to swallow the world.  Well that is the premise of the film but don't let it deter you from some good solid fun.  The plot is at best swiss cheeselike but the film has style and creativity to make up for its shortcomings.  Most importantly the film is loaded with generous doses of humour throughout.  David Warner plays the owner of the museum and like almost all of his performances is a joy to watch as he slightly hams his way through this film.  Some of his lines are the most memorable particularly as he talks to a jock about his wax creations staring at a representation of The Phantom of the Opera saying They will make a movie out of anything having just heard that it had been filmed multiple times.  The rest of the cast is adequate.  Zach Galligan gives his mediocre best in the male lead but two stunning beauties supply something to visually feast on despite their lack of acting breadth. Michelle Johnson and Deborah Foreman do their level best to entertain.  The film is an obvious homage to the horror genre with all kinds of visual allusions to former horror films.  Anthony Hickox the director creates a fun horror film that I think his father Douglas Hickox the director of my personal favorite horror film Theater of Blood with Vincent Price would certainly have been proud of for its ability to mix chills with fun.  The film also has a nice cameo by Patrick Macnee the old avenger himself.  Two minor flaws for me are the ending which is somewhat too forced and the bloodletting which may be a tad overdone at times.  Notwithstanding this criticism one of my favorite scenes in the film is the one where the man who came to Dracula's dinner tablealbeit minus much of his legagonizes in pain as he is prodded poked chewed etc.. whilst a fight is going on around him.  A fun fun film.".

Nice neat fun.It's especially impressive considering it's from a firsttime writerdirector Anthony Hickox who later went on to make decent werewolf TV movie Full Eclipse in 1993. Here he gives his own homage to a wide variety of horror movies. You've got your werewolf movie the very first waxwork incidentally your vampire movie mummies zombies and an trashy period piece about the Marquis de Sade ... all of these are in waxwork museum along with brief appearances from aliens Jack the Ripper and more.At first I expected it just to be a Dr Terror's House of Horror style piece with six different stories involved but it turns out the film has more than enough original ideas to keep itself going. It all ends with every waxwork piece in the place coming to life for a final battle. Which is nice. The actors playing the teenagers all give fairly decent entertaining performances and you have notable cameos from the likes of Miles O'Keeffe John RhysDavies as the werewolf David Warner and Patrick Macnee who was in The Howling. The script is pretty well structured and very little about the storyline is disappointing.All in all this is among the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while and I'd recommend it if you're after an ninety minutes of lighthearted slightly twisted enjoyment.".

John Rhys Davies long before his now famous Gimli the Dwarf days is here as a tortured dramatic werewolf. Miles O'Keefe whom hardcore MST3K fans will have no trouble recognizing is a hair product dependent Count Dracula who seduces the richbitch of the group into a nasty bloody grossout dinner party. The Nice Girl Deborah Foreman is drawn into the SM world of The Marquis De Sade as played by the too seldom seen J. Kenneth Campbell and it is up to the rich boy turned nice guy to save her before she is whipped to death. Once all of the displays are filled the characters within are unleashed and it becomes a war within the wax museum as the remaining heroes must now battle the wax monsters and their transformed friends. All in all this plays more like a comedy than a horror film but the violence when it appears is so overthetop that splatter fans won't be too disappointed.Followed by a pretty good sequel filled with numerous references to classic horror.

Waxwork is quite frankly my favorite horror film ever. It has a clever original story memorable monsters and the lovely talented Deborah Foreman as the leading lady. Really what else could you possibly need in a film?The plot starts out simply enough six college seniors get invited to attend a latenight showing of the exhibits in a new waxworks building. But the characters in each of the displays are much more lifelike than they seem and when you step past the railing into the displays you're taken into an illusionary world where the characters live breathe... and kill.Pretty creepy huh?Among the main cast members are Zach Galligan as Mark Foreman as Sarah David Warner as the Waxwork's owner Mr. David Lincoln Dana Ashbrook as Tony Michelle Johnson as Mark's exgirlfriend China Miles O'Keeffe as Count Dracula or as he's known as in this film The Count John RhysDavies as a werewolf J. Kenneth Campbell as the Marquis de Sade and Patrick Macnee as Sir Wilfred Mark's godfather. While Ashbrook and Macnee give good performances with their roles it is Foreman and Warner who give the best performances. Galligan though gives as good wooden acting as any actor in the modern day Star Wars prequel films.Among the many good moments in the film we get a few good oneliners in the mostly serious horror flick good acting a clever plot likable characters and a truly frightening though brief blackandwhite sequence with zombies! The musical score by Roger Bellon is also especially impressive for such a Bbudgeted horror movie particularly the main theme and the Mark and Sarah theme which is heard twice when Mark is with Sarah outside her apartment and then when Mark takes Sarah's hand in the de Sade exhibit and leaves the display with her.Of the bad parts we get some lessthanimpressive cardboard sets a werewolf that looks like a Muppet on steroids lipsticklooking lashes on Sarah's back when she is whipped in the Marquis display and the mentioned injuries curiously disappear when she leaves the display and plot holes big enough to drive cars through. For example the Marquis display hypnotizes Sarah when she stares at it and steps inside of it but the others do not get hypnotized by their displays. Also some gore is unnecessary do we really need to see a hunter being torn in half by a werewolf?.Still despite its flaws Waxwork is a wonderful horror film that scares as much as it entertains. It may not be that scary by today's standards but it goes well with popcorn and soda. So dim the lights if you dare and enjoy watching this fine lesserknown horror film.Would you like a closer look?".

In the last segment they're menaced by Springheel Jack.In this film a Waxwork appears in what seems to be a residential neighborhood  strange place to try to do business. It is filled with various death scenes involving werewolves vampires zombies mummies and so on. Some characters we don't see too much of seem to include the Invisible Man Jack the Ripper. A group of young people are invited to a party at the Waxwork and some of them step onto the displays and find themselves transported into a live action scene where their lives are in danger.I had a good time watching it. Some of the effects in it are good as in the vampire one but the werewolf is one of the worst I've seen. I liked it enough I'll definitely check out the sequel.".

It is filled with various death scenes involving werewolves vampires zombies mummies and so on. Some characters we don't see too much of seem to include the Invisible Man Jack the Ripper. A group of young people are invited to a party at the Waxwork and some of them step onto the displays and find themselves transported into a live action scene where their lives are in danger.I had a good time watching it. Some of the effects in it are good as in the vampire one but the werewolf is one of the worst I've seen. I liked it enough I'll definitely check out the sequel.";

	schema:headline " Hugely enjoyable 80's horror splatter outing";
	schema:reviewBody "A group of college students stumble across a waxworks museum where the displays come murderously to life. Writerdirector Anthony Hickox uses the entertainingly simple premise to pay niftywitty and affectionate tongueincheek homage to such classic horror creatures as Dracula the mummy the werewolf and even the shambling cemetery zombies from Night of the Living Dead. Moreover Hickox certainly doesn't skimp on the gloriously graphic and excessive gore with a juicy head squishing and the vampire sequence in particular providing the undeniable gruesome highlights. Zach Gilligan makes for a likable hero as nice rich guy Mark Deborah Foreman is her usual adorable self as sweet virginal innocent Sarah the foxy Michelle Johnson burns up the screen as the brash China and Miles O'Keeffe projects a potently brooding sexuality as a suave Dracula. The scene with the Marquis De Sade splendidly played with lipsmacking wicked relish by J. Kenneth Campbell whipping Sarah and giving the comely lass her first intense orgasm registers strongly as a genuinely sexy and erotic set piece. Seasoned vets David Warner as the waxwork's sarcastic owner Patrick Macnee as jolly crippled eccentric Sir Wilfred and John RhysDavies as a tormented werewolf give the picture an extra buzzing energy and a sense of true class. The lively and exciting climax totally smokes as well. Both Gerry Lively's glossy cinematography and Roger Bellon's robust score are up to speed. A seriously fun fright flick.".

I watched the uncensored version and although it did have some really bloody parts especially the vampire scene I gotta admit i expected a bit more as far as gore. Even so it's still a very good monster flick. If it woulda been a little bloodier and gorier it probably would have received a 9 out of 10 and maybe even a solid 10. I'd recommend this one to not only fans of cheesy '80s horror like myself but any horror fans just don't expect it to be hella serious.".

It's welldirected beautifully atmospheric with some gorgeous sets and a wonderful music score. There's also a neat truly scary black  white sequence. And there's TONS of blood and gore. But I didn't really like it. The script is silly especially in the explanation of what's going on this is actually a horror comedybut the comedy is painfully unfunny and the horror too explicit to laugh at the acting is TERRIBLE Galligan is the worst offender and they cast Miles O'Keeffe as Dracula!!!! Even worse his voice is dubbedand looks it. Basically the violence gore special effects score and settings are greateverything else blows. It's really too badthis film does have potential but it doesn't have the talent to carry it out.I saw two versions of thisthe R rated and the unrated. The R rated is bloody but the unrated is just unbelievable. There's a LOT more blood and violence especially in the Dracula sequence. There is a sequence where blood is literally covering the walls!

	schema:reviewBody "That sums up what happens with writer  director Anthony Hickox's film Waxwork which puts its own '80s spin on the classic wax museum horror story.A delicious David Warner plays an evil waxworks owner with very special displays  they draw people in the people are taken back in time get killed and then become a permanent part of the displays. The displays feature such classic fictional and historic monsters as a werewolf Count Dracula Miles O'Keeffe a mummy a group of zombies the Marquis de Sade J. Kenneth Campbell Audrey II etc. Warner is all about destroying the world here because as he puts it somebody's got to do it. Among the heroic characters who catch on to his scheme are Gremlins star Zach Galligan as Mark and '80s sweetie Deborah Foreman as Sarah who worked again with Hickox on Sundown The Vampire in Retreat. Fortunately Mark has an ally in his fight against evil his godfather Sir Wilfred or Wilfie if you prefer ever delightful Patrick Macnee who joins in the final big battle with a tricked out wheelchair.The movie is good fun from start to finish it's spirited entertainment that's nicely realized visually with fine production design by Gianni Quaranta costumes by Leonard Pollack and cinematography by Gerry Lively. In true Night of the Living Dead tradition the zombie sequence is in black  white which only adds to the appeal. A good supporting cast also features Michelle Johnson Blame It on Rio Dana Ashbrook 'Twin Peaks' Clare Carey 'Coach' Charles McCaughan as the exasperated detective and a too briefly seen John Rhys Davies Raiders of the Lost Ark as the human incarnation of the werewolf. True enough that Galligan isn't playing the most engaging or likable hero here but Foreman more than makes up for that with her sunny presence. O'Keeffe is of course stiff as always but Warner and Campbell are great villains.Hickox gets things off to a highly amusing start with an unlikely choice of music for the opening precredits bit and keeps things interesting and entertaining. When the final battle takes place with Sir Wilfred and his associates taking on their formidable opponents the results are too hard to resist. Makeup effects are by the talented Bob Keen Dog Soldiers Hellraiser Candyman and his Image Animation company and are generally pretty good.By the time this movie is over it literally brings the house down and while it could have used a little bit of tightening it still manages not to overstay its welcome and has some nice moments along the way.Director Hickox appears in a small role as the depraved English prince.Followed by Waxwork II Lost in Time in 1992.Seven out of 10.".

When the final battle takes place with Sir Wilfred and his associates taking on their formidable opponents the results are too hard to resist. Makeup effects are by the talented Bob Keen Dog Soldiers Hellraiser Candyman and his Image Animation company and are generally pretty good.By the time this movie is over it literally brings the house down and while it could have used a little bit of tightening it still manages not to overstay its welcome and has some nice moments along the way.Director Hickox appears in a small role as the depraved English prince.Followed by Waxwork II Lost in Time in 1992.Seven out of 10.";

You know what who cares! He's hot! ALSO loved watching him sword fight. I just wish the parts with him in them were longer. I've seen many House of Wax etc. movies that are similar but this one was so cool because the people actually went into the wax scenes. And that guy on the table with the halfeaten leg! Yeah it was actually funny! I also saw the Waxworks II movie and thought it was funny but where was the Marquis?? Definitely LOVED this movie better.".

But that's part of what we like about these movies they're not afraid to do anything that they want! To me at least one of the neatest aspects is the soundtrack. During the mummy scene they play the Swan Lake theme song. When they played it I figured that it is the right kind of music for that type of scene. But what they play during the closing credits is a real surprise. Other horror flicks with really neat soundtracks are Down aka The Shaft and Blood Diner probably the only horror flick that brings to mind Chuck Jones's cartoon What's Opera Doc?.All in all this has got to be one of the coolest movies of all time. Also starring David Warner Patrick Macnee of The Avengers and John RhysDavies of the Indiana Jones and Lord of the Rings series.I noticed that the credits thanked directors such as Spielberg Landis and Dante.

The period setting the director's first though not last feature to adopt this lends an aesthetic quality in this case which complements  or one might say excuses  his customary austerity. The simple plot proves quietly fascinating throughout an aristocratic lady is saved from nearrape by an enemy Count Bruno Ganz though the woman is no great beauty the man apparently loses his head over her almost compromising his own rank into the bargain. The Marquise and her family cannot understand this impulsive behavior but then she finds herself mysteriously pregnant her parents and brother obviously shun her but the returning Count is even more intent on marrying her she is a widow who has already borne two children. Eventually the Marquise puts an ad in a newspaper requesting the father to present himself  and at the appointed hour it is none other than the mortified Count himself who turns up having apparently taken advantage of her while she was unconscious on the night of the attack! As with all of the director's work this is certainly not for all tastes but as I said at the beginning it is exquisitely filmed by Nestor Almendros on wonderful and expansive locations  though the approach is thoroughly lowkey mostly confined to medium shots of people conversing against a backdrop of candlelit interiors in keeping with the intimate nature of the tale. While for all his straining for realism even Rohmer's modernday efforts could be deemed contrived on occasion here he seems to have embraced a deliberate artificiality the expulsion of the bewildered heroine in particular is redolent of barnstorming melodramas! perhaps to better convey the intolerant morality of its distant time. Though I am not sure parallels to the Immaculate Conception were intended THE MARQUISE OF O does recall Manoel De Oliveira's contemporaneous and regrettably littleknown BENILDE OR THE VIRGIN MOTHER 1975 which while comparably 'selfconscious' is perhaps an even more compelling thoughtprovoking  and altogether spiritual  experience.".

	schema:headline " Tragicomic Rape";
	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't ever seen a rape comedy before but after my first viewing of The Marquise of O I have to admit that that is indeed what I have seen... and it made me laugh sometimes and sit in horror others. I hope you understand before you question my moral or intellectual composure that I try as often as possible to take films and characters seriously within their own context. I am that guy that gets angry when people laugh in movies like 2001 A Space Odyssey and There Will Be Blood and yet The Marquise of O seemed somehow different. I wasn't the only one laughing in the theater.The premise is simple provided you live within the mindset of an early 19th century aristocrat there lies the comedy a Russian Lieutenant in the midst of battle against the Germans saves the German Commander's daughter from being raped by his own troops only to rape her in her room later in the night after she has taken a sleeping potion. This is only implied but the rest of the film will consist of the Russian Lieutenant making strange and semiobvious attempts to somehow right his own wrong as The Marquise struggles to understand and deal with her seemingly random pregnancy.I can only imagine that to Eric Rohmer this story must have represented the absurdity of the times and he makes no attempt to sugar coat it or even explain it to the audience. From the incredibly polite beginning battle sequence to the awkward incestuous displays of affection you are forced to accept what seems to you to be ridiculous circumstances... Then comes the reaction to her pregnancy a long scene in which you simultaneously connect with feel and understand her pain while giggling at the wild opinions and questions that ensue. To us her pain is real but her life seems fake even though it has been real at one point.It helps that the film is played straight and acted beautifully. As always Rohmer has a perfect eye and many others have pointed out Nestor Almendros's cinematography which enlightens the already hypnotic imagery. I suggest you check it out if this all sounds good to you. I hope I didn't offend anyone but this film is so strange I feel it has to be talked about.".

	onyx:emotionText "I hadn't ever seen a rape comedy before but after my first viewing of The Marquise of O I have to admit that that is indeed what I have seen... and it made me laugh sometimes and sit in horror others. I hope you understand before you question my moral or intellectual composure that I try as often as possible to take films and characters seriously within their own context. I am that guy that gets angry when people laugh in movies like 2001 A Space Odyssey and There Will Be Blood and yet The Marquise of O seemed somehow different. I wasn't the only one laughing in the theater.The premise is simple provided you live within the mindset of an early 19th century aristocrat there lies the comedy a Russian Lieutenant in the midst of battle against the Germans saves the German Commander's daughter from being raped by his own troops only to rape her in her room later in the night after she has taken a sleeping potion.

	schema:reviewBody "Die Marquise von O... or The Marquise of O is a coproduction between West Germany and France from 1976 so this one has its 40th anniversary this year. The cast is almost exclusively German but the writer and director is ric Rohmer which explains the French involvement. Rohmer was in his 50s at that point and already an Oscar nominee. His 100minute movie here was based on a Heinrich von Kleist story and is certainly among the writer's most known adaptations in film. I will not mention all the actors in here in detail as you can see them in the cast list but it can be said that lead actress Edith Clever who plays the title character for a German Film Award for her performance here and so did her male colead Bruno Ganz for whom it was the big breakthrough as an actor and he worked with Herzog Wenders and many other prestigious filmmakers in the years to come. This movie here received lots of awards attention probably also because German period pieces are really nothing you get to see that frequently.Most of this praise and awards recognition also like the BAFTA win had to do with the technical side of the film and also the visual side and I would agree that costumes sets and cinematography are those areas where the film works the best. Or I could also say only areas where it works as I personally was not impressed at all by the viewing. Clever was not really memorable as the main character and being a big Ganz fan I was disappointed by how he went overthetop with his performance on some occasion. The costumes gave him enough showiness already and I hoped for more quiet subtlety. Also I felt that Rohmer's story here just wasn't enough for 100 minutes and that he stretched the few crucial plot points pregnancy relationship between the two protagonists until they became really uninteresting to watch from the perspective of the audience. I am very much baffled by this film's success. I cannot deny it. I have not seen enough other stuff by Rohmer which is why I am still undecided if the maker is the problem here or just the subject. But I do know for sure that I cannot recommend the watch here. Thumbs down from me and admittedly I will say that period pieces have never been my favorite genre of film but still there are more than just a few that I consider superior to this one. Watch something else instead.".

It seems to me that he wasn't particularly interested in this project or at least he is unable to make the story as interesting as I find most of his other films. However several points elevate this film far beyond what it could have been. First thing the cinematography by Nstor Almendros is stunning. Rohmer pays particular attention to the composition something which he isn't generally known for. I think it hurts the film but one thing can't be denied it looks as painterly as possible. Also the performances are generally great. Bruno Ganz kind of disappointed me but that's mainly because I consider him one of the greatest actors. His performance here is good but not at the level of the other films in which I've seen him. On the other hand the star of the film Edith Clever is amazing as the titular character. She becomes pregnant even though she has not had relations with a man since her husband died a couple of years earlier. She must face the prejudices of the time a good story of a woman up against society though it's been done better before. The Marquise's parents are played by Peter Lhr and Edda Seippel and they both give excellent performances as well. All in all a beautiful experience if not the most exciting.".

	schema:headline " The Headsman proves a nice surprise";
	schema:reviewBody "I like history. Sometimes I read it. Sometimes I watch documentaries. And occasionally a movie with enough realism to keep my addiction satisfied at the same time I'm entertained will surface. From the descriptions I read of Shadow of the Sword I had some small hope it might be one of those movies. You can't imagine how delighted I was when that turned out to be the case.In the Europe of the 1500's the Catholic Church was almost literally all powerful. It was involved in every facet of every life from the ceremonial to the governmental to the daybyday. It's only natural that the church  for both reasons of charity as well as the replenishment of the priesthood  would take charge of orphaned boys. Martin and Georg are two such children. Raised together and raising hell together the two are close friends until they day they're old enough to be separated into training for their adult responsibilities.Georg Peter McDonald is taken by the Archbishop John Shrapnel where he is groomed to return to his home town as the prior of the local monastery. Meanwhile Martin Nikolaj CoasterWaldau becomes a soldier for the empires and achieves the rank of captain. After some fifteen years apart Martin finds himself camped near his former home and he takes the opportunity to visit his old friend. The two men are delighted to see each other and spend a few hours catching up.Martin however has one more errand he to run. He's been wounded in the fighting and needs medical care. After a brief chance meeting in the village Martin discovers a pretty local girl named Anna Anastasia Griffith who among other things is reputed to be a witch and a healer. When Martin visits her in her remote home he discovers two things he loves her and her father is the local executioner. The former is difficult at best since he's got to leave with his troops in the morning. The latter is almost as much of a problem since executioners are considered untouchable by the rest of the citizens.Eventually Martin is released from his duties and he returns to Anna only to find that her father has died. With little else for which he's qualified Martin reluctantly takes over as executioner and soon finds himself a very busy man. The Catholic Church has virtually no tolerance for dissent and punishments are harsh at best. Things only get worse when the Archbishop demands that Georg tighten up his control of the local populace and leaves an Inquisitor Steven Berkhoff behind to ensure that that's what happens.Soon enough the old friends are caught up in a battle of conscience fear and power that can only partly be solved by getting to the bottom of their own secret past. But time is short betrayal looms and failure means banishment or death for them and those they love.The casting in Shadow of the Sword is excellent. You believe in Martin's strength and courage even as you entirely buy into Georg's innate piety. While that has something to do with the look of the men chosen to fill these roles it's primarily due to the fact that Nikolaj CoasterWaldau and Peter McDonald are very capable actors the former in particular. Anastasia Griffith holds her own and John Shrapnel is terrific every time he's on screen but my pick for most impressive performance comes from Julie Cox in a relatively small but pivotal role as the prostitute Margaretha.The script was quite good and the sets costumes and makeup effects were even better. The only real complaint I have about Shadow of the Sword involves a number of terribly jarring edits. I suspect these were made in an effort to lower the running time almost two hours but too many were too careless. I would have much preferred to have a longer movie. Besides since what I saw was pretty good I can only imagine that much of what I didn't see was pretty good too.The bottom line Shadow of the Sword isn't perfect. But it's interesting and entertaining and that's plenty. I liked this movie and those with an interest in drama history or both will find something there for them too.POLITICAL NOTES Even Catholics will likely confess that the church isn't always right. But it's rarely been more wrong than it was during the course of the Crusades and the later Inquisition. The Catholic Church has obviously mellowed and learned from some of its mistakes. But it's apparent that not everybody has. It seems that the word crusade and all of its inherent evils can be crudely translated as being synonymous with jihad. The fundamentalist Islam war on everybody who isn't a Muslim has nothing and everything in common with what the church did so long ago and certainly Shari'a has an appalling amount in common with the techniques of the Inquisition we now so roundly condemn. Shadow of the Sword shows both the politics and the lust for control behind such campaigns all too clearly and the graphic results offer up some lessons we'd do well to continue to remember today.FAMILY SUITABILITY Shadow of the Sword is rated R for violence and a scene of sexuality. This is not a movie I'd recommend your children see. Some scenes of torture while not gratuitous are quite graphic and more than a little difficult to watch. The subject matter is also likely beyond the understanding of younger kids. I'd recommend Shadow of the Sword only for those age 14 or so and up. I'd also recommend that if you and your family do see the movie you have a little conversation afterward about just what religious fanaticism means for the fate of freedom and that you do your best to take those lessons to heart!".

From the descriptions I read of Shadow of the Sword I had some small hope it might be one of those movies. You can't imagine how delighted I was when that turned out to be the case.In the Europe of the 1500's the Catholic Church was almost literally all powerful. It was involved in every facet of every life from the ceremonial to the governmental to the daybyday. It's only natural that the church  for both reasons of charity as well as the replenishment of the priesthood  would take charge of orphaned boys. Martin and Georg are two such children. Raised together and raising hell together the two are close friends until they day they're old enough to be separated into training for their adult responsibilities.Georg Peter McDonald is taken by the Archbishop John Shrapnel where he is groomed to return to his home town as the prior of the local monastery. Meanwhile Martin Nikolaj CoasterWaldau becomes a soldier for the empires and achieves the rank of captain. After some fifteen years apart Martin finds himself camped near his former home and he takes the opportunity to visit his old friend. The two men are delighted to see each other and spend a few hours catching up.Martin however has one more errand he to run. He's been wounded in the fighting and needs medical care. After a brief chance meeting in the village Martin discovers a pretty local girl named Anna Anastasia Griffith who among other things is reputed to be a witch and a healer. When Martin visits her in her remote home he discovers two things he loves her and her father is the local executioner. The former is difficult at best since he's got to leave with his troops in the morning. The latter is almost as much of a problem since executioners are considered untouchable by the rest of the citizens.Eventually Martin is released from his duties and he returns to Anna only to find that her father has died. With little else for which he's qualified Martin reluctantly takes over as executioner and soon finds himself a very busy man. The Catholic Church has virtually no tolerance for dissent and punishments are harsh at best. Things only get worse when the Archbishop demands that Georg tighten up his control of the local populace and leaves an Inquisitor Steven Berkhoff behind to ensure that that's what happens.Soon enough the old friends are caught up in a battle of conscience fear and power that can only partly be solved by getting to the bottom of their own secret past. But time is short betrayal looms and failure means banishment or death for them and those they love.The casting in Shadow of the Sword is excellent. You believe in Martin's strength and courage even as you entirely buy into Georg's innate piety. While that has something to do with the look of the men chosen to fill these roles it's primarily due to the fact that Nikolaj CoasterWaldau and Peter McDonald are very capable actors the former in particular. Anastasia Griffith holds her own and John Shrapnel is terrific every time he's on screen but my pick for most impressive performance comes from Julie Cox in a relatively small but pivotal role as the prostitute Margaretha.The script was quite good and the sets costumes and makeup effects were even better. The only real complaint I have about Shadow of the Sword involves a number of terribly jarring edits. I suspect these were made in an effort to lower the running time almost two hours but too many were too careless. I would have much preferred to have a longer movie. Besides since what I saw was pretty good I can only imagine that much of what I didn't see was pretty good too.The bottom line Shadow of the Sword isn't perfect. But it's interesting and entertaining and that's plenty. I liked this movie and those with an interest in drama history or both will find something there for them too.POLITICAL NOTES Even Catholics will likely confess that the church isn't always right. But it's rarely been more wrong than it was during the course of the Crusades and the later Inquisition. The Catholic Church has obviously mellowed and learned from some of its mistakes. But it's apparent that not everybody has. It seems that the word crusade and all of its inherent evils can be crudely translated as being synonymous with jihad. The fundamentalist Islam war on everybody who isn't a Muslim has nothing and everything in common with what the church did so long ago and certainly Shari'a has an appalling amount in common with the techniques of the Inquisition we now so roundly condemn. Shadow of the Sword shows both the politics and the lust for control behind such campaigns all too clearly and the graphic results offer up some lessons we'd do well to continue to remember today.FAMILY SUITABILITY Shadow of the Sword is rated R for violence and a scene of sexuality. This is not a movie I'd recommend your children see. Some scenes of torture while not gratuitous are quite graphic and more than a little difficult to watch. The subject matter is also likely beyond the understanding of younger kids. I'd recommend Shadow of the Sword only for those age 14 or so and up. I'd also recommend that if you and your family do see the movie you have a little conversation afterward about just what religious fanaticism means for the fate of freedom and that you do your best to take those lessons to heart!";

	schema:reviewBody "The Headsman is a much better film than most of the IMDb ratings and reviews here. One problem is that people want to be entertained in a medieval film and having swordplay gore special effects a princess and a hero all help. This film doesn't have that. One reviewer compared it with The Name of the Rose and it definitely falls into that category. There really isn't much intrigue however and that would have made it a better film. It is more about the honor of Martin Nikolaj CoasterWaldau who has a childhood friendship with Georg Peter McDonald marries an outcast Anna played by Anastasia Griffith and chooses an untouchable professional as an executioner. It is about human nature betrayal love ambition greed honor and the dilemmas that come when forces beyond one's control affects one's life and one is faced with undesirable choices.Forces of good and evil are at battle as mistrust superstition crudeness and naivety dominate the Inquisition period. Not everything is within control but Martin lives honorable and his friend Georg does too but at times is torn by his conscience and what the town leaders and Inquisition ask him to do.Unfortunately Martin is unaware that Georg is willing to help but his hands are tied. Sadly no one questions the despicable filthy Fabio Eddie Marsan about the truth although it certainly would made sense. But perhaps that makes heroes in the film an outcome not preferred. And in those times witches and heretics were hanged executed or burned. Reason wasn't the norm but fear and superstition ruled. No heroes things beyond our control love and suffering. Even being the daughter of the emperor or son of the archbishop doesn't save anyone. For comparison the Black Death nor Inquisition spared no one of title.In the historical context it's a graphically accurate film not a Hollywoodtype film e.g Braveheart. The set and acting were excellent. Cinematography and atmosphere were good although I would have preferred sharper camera work and use of the landscape. But perhaps being lowbudgeted the filming was limited. Script was reasonable but could be stronger. Since reality isn't as dramatic as fantasy this movie won't excite many unless you like a thoughtful period drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paris in the year 2000. A thoughtless gesture a scrap of paper thrown in the hands of a beggar causes a general altercation. As a matter of fact the Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke goes from this incident to relate bits of various characters' lives. There's among others Anne Juliette Binoche an actress who travels from movie to movie. Her husband Georges a war photographer whose photos express pain and suffering from the countries he visited. Jean who fled from his father's farm in the north of France to come to Paris. Amadou who works in an institute for deaf and dumb children and Maria a Romanian woman who has trouble to make ends meet by begging. Like 71 Bits 1994 Haneke's movie is a patchwork of sequences shot in real time and interrupted with short black screens to have a break and in the same time to think about the sequence shot we have just seen.Shortly before the incident when Jean wants to go to Anne's flat the latter tells him the code of her flat if you want to enter my flat the code of my building is B4718. I'm not sure whether it's the right code but the building could epitomize a metaphor of a man's life. Every man's life is similar to a building kept generally by a code. The title of the film is rather easy to understand. The famous unknown code is a blocked access to any character's real life. This code is unknown for the strangers who surround him or her and as a consequence they don't known anything of his or her real life. It's this situation that is represented in Haneke's movie.On the surface Unknown Code seems more breathable than Haneke's previous works and looks like a Magnolia 1999  la Francaise. Michael Haneke juxtaposes different characters'different lives belonging to different social classes. They have apparently nothing in common except maybe that their own lives are kept by this unknown code for the others. However they are affected by terrible sorrows which paralyze the Western society without this latter realizes it. In this Haneke's opus there's neither the uppercut of Benny's video 1992 nor the icy violence of Funny Games 1997 but through an accurate study of these different journeys a quiet impressive of rigor making the director offers a disillusioned and black vision of this society. So he remains faithful to his favorite topics the difficulty of communication Amadou who tries to explain in a clumsy way his anger in front of Jean's unconsidered gesture. The way in which violence has become a feature of everyday life in a society which has become insensible to it we can remember perfectly the sequence shot when Anne irons she can hear shrill cries near her. She hesitates then resumes to iron. The omnipresence of racism and the insurmountable barrier of social classes the scene in the tube is a grievous example. They are serious topics that are generally way off cinema's regular radar. It takes all Haneke's courage to explore them. Something he has relentlessly done since the Seventh Continent 1989. So Unknown Code is a logical extension of Haneke's obsessions. To come back to the characters they feel either humiliated either difficulties to communicate. When it crosses our minds that we live inside this distressing universe it sends shivers down our spines. Once again Herr Haneke stirred some of the viewers's deep fears.So ultimately Unknown Code isn't as accessible as Haneke's other works by its nonexistent linear narration and the seriousness of its theses but I think that it's a winner in Haneke's work. Of course to watch a movie that breaks narrative conventions and expresses deeply pessimistic things is not for all tastes and that's partly why there'll never be general agreement about the famous Austrian filmmaker but at least this movie brings to the light of day thorny subjects hidden in the obscurity of cinema. It is a worthy movie far better than Hneke's next opus the Pianist 2001 but that's another story...".

Or he plays ironic tricks  having deaf kids do emotional charades or perform in a marching drum band or creating ambiguity about a door entry code to reinforce a theme of restless homelessness.

	schema:headline " Is Michael Haneke God?";
	schema:reviewBody "Well I suppose not  but he IS the most exciting and interesting new filmmaker around. I would say young filmmaker  only he's not young judging from his bio he's around 60. And he's not really new either  he's already made five films. But his films FEEL shockingly new  the MATERIAL is new and it's some measure of how glacial the pace of real aesthetic change is in this supposedlyglobalized world that he is only now becoming known in the U.S.Those of you who have seen his bestknown work Funny Games would probably agree with me that it is the most horrifying movie ever made. Games coolly subverts the conventions of the horror movie to unremittingly punish the audience for its desire for violence. The effect is unbelievably harrowing.Now we have Code Unknown which is not nearly as cruel an experience as Funny Games but which has the same strict intellectual armature. With as radical a technique as Godard's Haneke takes a short scuffle in the streets of Paris as the point of departure for a meditation on true knowledge in a world of chance and mischance.Haneke breaks the film up into short disconnected fragments with black spaces between them. In several no words are spoken while others turn out to be inside films that the lead character an actress played by Juliette Binoche is making.

He's not a Darren Aronofsky ringing a dozen eyepopping changes on an essentiallyempty story. And his intense horrors are justified by the depth and purity of his concerns  unlike those of say Tarentino or God help us! Guy Ritchie. Haneke's smarts are story and conceptual smarts not adolescent film smarts he's wildly daring but he's icily mature.

	onyx:emotionText "Well I suppose not  but he IS the most exciting and interesting new filmmaker around. I would say young filmmaker  only he's not young judging from his bio he's around 60. And he's not really new either  he's already made five films. But his films FEEL shockingly new  the MATERIAL is new and it's some measure of how glacial the pace of real aesthetic change is in this supposedlyglobalized world that he is only now becoming known in the U.S.Those of you who have seen his bestknown work Funny Games would probably agree with me that it is the most horrifying movie ever made. Games coolly subverts the conventions of the horror movie to unremittingly punish the audience for its desire for violence. The effect is unbelievably harrowing.Now we have Code Unknown which is not nearly as cruel an experience as Funny Games but which has the same strict intellectual armature. With as radical a technique as Godard's Haneke takes a short scuffle in the streets of Paris as the point of departure for a meditation on true knowledge in a world of chance and mischance.Haneke breaks the film up into short disconnected fragments with black spaces between them. In several no words are spoken while others turn out to be inside films that the lead character an actress played by Juliette Binoche is making. Many are long single shots  sometimes gliding along to follow the characters but sometimes rooted in one spot as the characters drift to and fro. And the stories such as they are wander too from Paris to what looks like the Balkans as Haneke follows Binoche her war photographer boyfriend his brother and father a street beggar who is deported from Paris a young black teacher of the deaf and a host of other ancillary characters.

	schema:reviewBody "A brilliant an original film. It unites current fads in art cinema the frequent long take and multiple interlocking storylines both of which are in danger of becoming clich. The way that these interlocking stories begin and end is very interesting. It gives us so little and leaves us to figure out so much for ourselves. It's like a cinematic test of the psychological principle of closure. We ourselves have to connect the scenes and build the stories. In a way it's kind of a game and a fun one at that. But it does cover some serious and important topics namely the interaction of the various and constantly increasing variety of peoples in Europe. Most of the action takes place in France although it does journey to Eastern Europe often and even Africa at one point. And thankfully Haneke isn't happy about simply making blanket political statements about the situation. For example in the film's second scene a white boy throws a piece of paper into a homeless woman's lap. A young black man an immigrant from Africa sees him and tries to force him to apologize to the woman. They get into a fight when the white boy refuses the police see it and haul the black man the white boy and the homeless woman away. The black man is charged the homeless woman a refugee from Romania is deported and the white boy is let go. The criticism seems clear and obvious until we find out that the piece of paper which the audience is originally to think is garbage is money. We learn this from the woman who tells someone else about it and how she had once done nearly the same thing to someone below her in class. None of the stories are resolved. We are left to finish them for ourselves. This is one of the best films of recent years. Really there have been a ton of highlypraised directors who rely entirely on bags of gimmicks. It's so nice to see a modern film that actually achieves something resembling a reimagining of how narrative works in the cinema.".

	schema:headline " Why This Works";
	schema:reviewBody "People on the boards below have labelled this film as 'challenging'  they're right. It's difficult to compare with other films  certainly any not by Haneke such is the power of contemporary original cinematography. Shot in a long series of short scenes which to someone glancing at the film halfway through could seem as though they are totally unrelated. However one of the many little points of magic Haneke has implemented is that all the characters are connected not only by an event in the initial scene but thematically as well. I don't want to spoil too much of the movie but in a nutshell this film aims to discuss a number of political and social themes which do connect which in turn shed light on the thought that everything is interconnected and the links these connections provide can take an observer on a fascinating journey into one persons historyfuture and then another's. Through the scuffle at the start of the film wherein incidentally themes of civil right civic authority morality racism prejudice in general and sociology are all presented initially the characters who are apparently coincidentally caught up lead us into enlargements on these themes and even introduce new ones. The big ones are ones that were importantly contemporarily significant and still are at the time of the film's 2000 release. Asylum seeking the war in Kosovo and communication on a very grand scale are three big ones. But there's more  astoundingly  alienation of youth bullying interfamilial relationships nationality and a very intriguing look at cinema itself in conjuncture with thematic exploration of the individual deception and a person's 'real self' or as it is called in the film their 'true face'. Having just written that paragraph and retraced the film in my mind I find myself realising just how expansive this piece is. This is surprising perhaps as at first the series of short scenes suggests that it is not possible to really explore something in depth. But then again inquires Haneke I imagine if you get to the heart the very point of something in a short scene  what is that if not 'in depth'. I believe that is what Haneke has achieved here  with remarkable skill. How? Well the bottom line is this is exquisite drama. It's brilliantly beautifully acted it's bold at times it's suggestive without being glaring and then on the other hand it huddles things close to its chest which an observer will only discover if they look very intently. Some of these I'm sure I have not seen  the ones I have alone are too many in number to recount here. Countless little things are running across my mind as I decide what to include in this review  I must mention the cinematography in detail. There are scenes where there is no dialogue it is just an image with 'background noise'. But whatever is happening there in that scene is significant. It represents something and invites the viewer  undisrupted by dialogue or some other special event  to ask himherself what that is. To say 'what are the connections here what is this scene telling me and what are other scenes telling me about it'. That is why this works. To return to my introduction  the film is challenging in an importantly constructive sense. It makes you think it makes you work to get the meaning  and not only that  once it has you there it's been so constructed that it shapes that meaning in a certain way as to let you then perhaps rethink that idea in a new context! For some this will deserve multiple viewings but this is all the better. I think everyone should watch it at least twice. There's simply so much here and it's portrayed in such a refreshing way that it would be criminal not to give it special attention.P.s. A note on the title A few suggestions have been voiced here as to what the 'unknown code' is  I think it's a number of things. Like many things in the film such as themes it is repeated here and there so as to be more effective to an audience. But repeated in a totally different and context. It could be the strange signlanguage at the end of the film communication being a major idea it is most literally the door code to Anne's apartment but this in turn could represent attempts by the asylum seekers into France. Notice that Georges is removed from the apartment due to a fight and Maria is taken from France  due to a fight  and returns unsuccessfully. I think these are definite parallels  though they are tastefully engineered. This film excels in its ability never to be glaring brash and obvious. It lets the film speak for itself. Which is what all films should do.".

	schema:headline " Probably one of the more accessible of Haneke's dour psychological studies";
	schema:reviewBody "Code Unknown Incomplete Tales of Several Journeys 2000 is another of director Michael Haneke's deeply austere and emotionally rigid intellectual probes into the human condition and the various psychological elements that cause problems not only in our personal lives and relationships but in a broader sociological sense as well. At this point it is perhaps worth noting that the film's essaylike subtitle alludes to the style of the film which involves a number of long unbroken shot compositions some longer than ten minutes that often end abruptly with no real sense of resolution.Presented as a series of loosely connected vignettes that focus on the idea of character interaction as opposed to narrative direction Code Unknown is a difficult film to appreciate at least at the level that many of us would probably approach it. One of the main focus points here is the idea of perception how both we as an audience and the characters in the film perceive the action unfolding from the limited point of view that we've been given. Some good examples of this would include the lengthy and suitably tense scene early on in the story in which a number of unconnected characters all come together through a seemingly mundane event that ends with a scuffle erupting between a white teenager and a young black man resulting in both men  and the various onlookers  being arrested. Later midway through a particularly disconcerting scene a toddler playing on the balcony of a highrise apartment slips all the while watched with horror by his terrified parents who are powerless to do anything. Then finally towards the end of the film we watch in eager suspense as a young Arab boy harasses Juliette Binoche's character on a Parisian metro. Throughout the film and these sequences in particular we expect something spectacular and thrilling to happen but it never seems to arrive until of course we realise that 'something' is happening.As with his most recent film the highly acclaimed Hidden 2005 there are a number of interesting sequences in Code Unknown which on basis of description alone could easily lead one to believe that they are about to watch a tense Hollywood thriller. The film obviously couldn't be further removed from this ideal however with Haneke once again offering us a dour colourless psychological study in which characters crash into one another almost at random and cause a ripple effect that disrupts the order of everything that came before. Clearly Code Unknown is unconcerned with thrilling the audience at least not in the typical sense with the film never allowing the dramatic tension to build to anything beyond the confines of these various character vignettes that are strung together one by one in order to build up the story. This is a film that wants to enlighten with a raw depiction of everyday life taking the viewer from moments of deadpan humour albeit incredibly lowkey humour to scenes that evoke a feeling of almost crippling desperation. Once again these techniques are used to mislead the audience into thinking that the film is heading in a different very nonHanekelike direction before switching track and confounding us all over again. If you give it some time to really get going then the results can be oddly thrilling and  in my opinion  probably more enjoyable and satisfying overall than anything else Haneke has directed.Still the film does have that sense of screaming polemic that much of the director's previous work has occasionally descended into with the loose ends and the experiments in cinematic formalism creating a cold and intellectual exercise that will naturally turn many potential viewers away. A real shame too because regardless of these distancing intellectual experiments the direction photography and acting are superb throughout and  like The 7th Continent 1994 and Funny Games 1997  help to weave together a beguilingly tense tapestry of guilt anger misery and social despair.".

	schema:reviewBody "SLIGHT SPOILERS Released just prior to The Piano Teacher Michael Haneke's Code Unknown is a powerful exploration of the barriers and connections between diverse individuals in a multiracial city in this case Paris France. Called a collection of incomplete tales of several journeys Code Unknown has little plot only incident and observation.Shot in episodic fragments that last from a few seconds to several minutes each tale is tenuously connected by sudden cuts to black. Scenes appear to start in the middle and end with jarring abruptness as if the projectionist deliberately pulled the plug. The film begins with deafmute children acting out emotions. The children sign alone hiding place sad imprisoned but their classmates do not respond. This leads to an eightminute single unbroken shot that explores the chance interaction of the main characters and how a single act causes disparate lives to intertwine.While walking on a busy Paris street a teenager Jean Alexandre Hamidi meets his brother's girl friend a young actress named Anne Juliette Binoche.  He talks about his difficult life on the farm with his father who eventually expects him to take over. Jean frustrated and angry throws an empty bag into the lap of Maria Luminata Gheorghiu begging for change on the sidewalk. A young Sengalese man named Amadou Ona Lu Yenke who is a teacher of deaf children is offended by Jean's actions and confronts the younger man demanding he apologize to Maria. The police side with Jean and Amadou is arrested. We learn later that he is beaten while in police custody. Meanwhile Maria is deported to her home in Romania when she is found to be an illegal immigrant.In this fragment Haneke demonstrates how we often touch each other's life very briefly sometimes making snap judgments and evaluations about people then move on to our own activities without knowledge or awareness of the consequences to others. It allows the director to follow the lives of these characters for the rest of the film.In an extraordinary episode in the Paris Metro that feels extremely real Haneke asks us to confront the incomprehensibility of much of our experience. Anne on her way home after a day rerecording film dialogue is challenged by an Arab youth on the subway. Don't talk to commoners? he asks. How can you be so beautiful yet so arrogant?. When she retreats to the other end of the car he follows and sits next to her. When he spits in her face a man sitting opposite confronts the harasser who backs down but tries to frighten them both as he leaves the train. Anne cannot understand this behavior and walks home in the rain sobbing.I loved the sounds of the film the street noises the sounds of TVs blaring snippets of conversations from neighbors the exhilarating song and dance at a Romanian wedding and the final extended Brazilian drumming sequence which builds to a resounding climax. Performances are uniformly outstanding. Binoche is a marvel her performance is never selfconscious. During the shooting of a film she laughs uncontrollably then cries at will both achieved with effortless grace.This is not an easy film to watch and demands repeat viewing to fully grasp the director's intent. It will defeat those looking for unbroken narrative or character development but should interest those seeking a compelling commentary about the obstacles to communication in today's world. As he did in The Piano Teacher Haneke exquisitely captures the private moments of people the things they do when alone or away from friends. The film has an emotional immediacy that never seems forced or artificial. When I left the theater I felt unusually connected to the life around me. Both extremely beautiful and very ugly Code Unknown pulsates with the dance of life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Code Unknown doesn't live up to the promise of its opening scene an opening scene of which is a spectacularly composed and wonderfully executed continuous take of various people on a Parisian street intermingling interacting and walking back and forth. People travel from one end of the street to the other continuing their lives as we leave them and pick up another person walking back the other way things leading onto other things and a disagreement which turns rather more ugly than anyone would like. The elegance and the effort put into the sequence places us right there on that street with all of those people and it is a form of deep unflinching immersement no other trick nor ploy other than and sense of filmmaking will ever produce.One of those persons walking is Jean Hamidi a youngster of whom doesn't get on with his father the other individual at the other end of the street is Anne Binoche who's in binary opposition to Jean in terms of gender age and ethnicity. She appears to be in a rush and is talking busily into a cell phone  something in contrast to Jean's wondering loner built well and hulking an early attempt at most probably pointing out how diverse life is and how everyone occupies the same intimate plain or street and yet are miles apart in their ability to communicate and interpret epitomised when squabbling break out following an altercation. Such a hypothesis might very well be at the heart of Michael Haneke's Code Unknown I'm not sure that of communication and interpretation and how in spite of the fact we're all human just being able to get along is often beyond us. In this piece Haneke doesn't strike us as a director who uses conventional means of execution to get across a sense of unfolding highend drama.Take for instance the scene within which we are plunged into a couple enjoying time together in a swimming pool within the confines of their apartment's outdoor area  only they fail to spot their toddler child crawling along the ledge thus staring at a thirty storey drop. After going through the motions Haneke reveals that they were infact shooting a film within the film and none of it was real. In a redub session some time later the two actorcharacters begin to fall about into fits of laughter due to a joke as the unfolding drama plays out on a screen infront of them dominating the frame. It might be read into that this is Haneke's own cackling at what could be perceived as easydrama and cheaper easier ways of instilling frills into cinematic viewing the sort of thins one might attribute to more mainstream more Hollywoodised projects. Amusingly Haneke uses a frame grab from the aforementioned pool scene for the film's poster in order to advertise his film. Another curious idea Haneke here applies is his cutting off of scenes and sentences half way through finishing this sense of the neverending of the infinite and of the continuously progressive as each story literally happens in tandem feels desperately trying to push its way to the forefront of our attention. While the application of such an idea seems distinctive and creative on paper it very quickly formulates into something just grating.In Code Unknown he shoot couples having arguments in supermarkets before rekindling a couple of aisles later. The heated exchange begins to a background of alcohol an ugly debate made better once they're out and away from the intoxicating products and sharing the company of shelves sporting products of a healthier sort following their arrival at a part of the shop selling diary drinks and shelves containing beverages generally inclined to be good for you. Another strand sees an actress shooting scenes for that aforementioned fake film in which she falls afoul of a serial killer with a very specific modus operandi that is to say the locking of people in relatively large but empty mahogany drenched centuries old rooms and watching them slowly die. This idea of ugliness encapsulated by one man's nature combining with beauty elegance or highculture in the form of his chosen locale within which to kill seems to be a juxtaposition summing up the frantic and disjointed nature of the world and those within it those of whom are more often than not at complete odds with one another and yet are thrust into inhabiting this same plain as before.The film will carry along down this path opening with a telling prelude featuring deaf children attempting to play charades with one another using only sign language  interpretation being the key verb. Here lies an example of people attempting to figure out what it is the other person is thinking a struggling to comprehend the angle upon which they approach the trying to see things from their point of view before carrying on down a route of several strands depicting several sorts of people of varying ages and differing backgrounds. One cannot help but feel one is repeating one's self when one states that certain strands stories and interactions between those therein are more interesting than others. In spite of being fully aware of the year of Code Unknown's production the likes of everything made since from Babel to Betty Fisher  Other Stories to the more recent Swedish film Involuntary feels both a little bit better than Code Unknown and less top heavy. The more of these sorts of films one sees the more impacting and more concise one feels their overall thematic needs to be in order for it to actually resonate. There are a number of examples going back to 1993's Short Cuts which pull off the gross influx of stories and characters that it decides to take on  this expansive drawnout and weighty approach to things working well here and there but too often dragging Code Unknown down to the level of window dressing.".

That of course does not mean that they are bad by any definition but it does show that his movies are not necessarily for everyone. I for one believe that a filmmaker capable of making an audience uncomfortable while keeping their attention is a gifted filmmaker indeed and Haneke does that well with me. So without further ado Code Unknown is an ensemble film of characters lives that intermingle and run across each other in Paris. Unlike such films as 21 Grams Crash et al however Code Unknown is more of a statement on character's lack of identity than their interdigitated roles surrounding a social setting. Here one can hardly call what is on screen as social even while relationships unravel parties are held and filmswithinthefilm are made. If you want to see the most utterly alone characters in all of cinema look here.The other movie by Haneke I've seen is The Seventh Continent and these two movies are made in basically the exact same structure immense long takes with black leader in between to separate them. The only exception to that rule is when Juliette Binoche's character is acting in a movie at which point cuts occur signifying that movies are ultimately fake.Therein is probably one of the most difficult things about Haneke as a filmmaker he strongarms rather than invites. Long takes are typically used to make the audience to sit and look at the image on the screen for longer than they are normally accustomed to but with Haneke I feel like he's taking that concept to the extreme probably purposefully which is why I don't criticize him for it and basically forcing you into a specific perspective which he will not change. If Bazin is right and there's a world outside of the frame Haneke locks you away from it. And the only window he lets you have is to the world's darkest most impersonal facets.There's quite a long tradition of this in cinema however. John Cassavetes is probably the most famous filmmaker operating in this mode as he was known to purposefully cut out all the parts of his films that other people found enjoyable. Haneke certainly has something to say and certainly knows exactly how to say it. Just be forewarned that this movie is not meant to be enjoyable.Otherwise I really like his exploration of miscommunication and the ways in which the characters set themselves up to never be able to express themselves truly. If the movie weren't so insistent in tone perhaps the emotional drive behind it would have more reverberation in my own viewing of the movie but instead the disciplinary shooting causes me to be intellectually resistant to his particular worldview.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "A mesmerising film that spoke to me on so many levels. The opening sequence after the deaf children which kick starts the several narrative strands is such a brilliantly filmed sequence. An admittedly wrong act by a youngster how often do we see that which is responded to by a passerby thus setting in motion a chain of events that touch the lives of various people. The subheading of the film 'Incomplete tales of several journeys' reminded me of '71 fragments....'. Life is incomplete unfinished and things are not resolved. What Haneke is taking on board here is the responsibility as a filmmaker to present the fiction as honestly as possible. This is perhaps why he is interested in using the fixed camera approach. A sort of antiHollywood if you like shooting style. By minimising the shots and dispensing with editing within a sequence he is presenting something in real time and with the intent I imagine of being more honest and less manipulative. That said I think in a work of fiction it is still possible to present a narrative using a variety of shots to engage theviewer. As a filmmaker you are manipulating time but who said a filmmaker had to be true to the viewer. Film is fiction even documentary. It could even be argued that documentary is less honest than fiction. What is truth? Or is film really the truth 24 times a second. We know who said that. So as a filmmaker just by presenting a narrative we are presenting fiction however we show it for we are giving our interpretation of events that we have written. Haneke is trying to straddle a fundamental problem here. One of truth. I think he fails in being honest but succeeds in making a superb piece of cinema. The acting is beyond reproach. Binoche excels herself in a scene which is a rehearsal for a film within the film. It is a fixed video camera filming her as she reacts to the direction given her by the director off camera. It is a wonderful scene. Another powerful scene is when Binoche is on the metro and is pestered by two youths. She moves seat but is confronted again. It is a brilliant example of how we are unable to break out of our rigid class system and confront what is happening around us. Afraid of the world around us. Tied to a rigid system of behaviour. Mute. The big bad city is all around us and it will chew us up and spit us out whatever path we choose. We are slaves to its rules. I suppose Haneke is saying this is the route we are going down. He is also saying that often the route is out of our control. Meaning our lives are out of our control. We are at the mercy of chance encounters brief moments that we pass by without acknowledging. These small instances are what really govern all our destinies and the incomplete time we spend here.".

	schema:reviewBody "By reading the title Code inconnu Rcit incomplet de divers voyages which is translated as Code Unknown Incomplete Tales of Several Journeys you can already know what to expect. You'll get several story lines and none of them will be thoroughly explained or even finished. That means of course that there is a big chance you will not understand it or that you'll have to stay very focused from the beginning until the end. Personally I don't mind watching 'weird' movies with a special concept but I know many people don't like it all that much.Code Inconnu tells the story of several people who don't seem to have anything in common except for the place where they live Paris. But what they don't always know is that their lives are all connected in one way or another. George a young farm boy wants to leave his silent father and wants to go living with his older brother in Paris. That brother is a photographer who covers the war in Kosovo and therefor can't let him in. He's upset and throws a bag of halfeaten pastry into a beggar's lap. A black man witnesses it all and sees it as a form of disrespect and racism towards the beggar. He starts a fight with George which upsets Anne Laurent the young men's sisterinlaw. This fight also colors her relationship with her husband when he returns from the war in ExYugoslavia. In the meantime both the black man and the beggar have been arrested the beggar is send back to Kosovo and Anne is the subject of racism herself when she is verbally attacked on the subway by some young Arabs...The main problem that I had with this movie is that it never seemed to finish what it started. Michael Haneke the director and writer of the script has come up with an original idea but should have stayed with only three or maximum four people. I understand that he wanted to show the world that we are all connected in one way or another and that we all affect each other's lives but sometimes it was impossible to keep it all apart and to see it as one solid movie. It sometimes was a bit messy and I can understand that many people who don't like or who aren't very familiar with 'foreign' cinema will not like it at all. Still I don't have the feeling that Michael Haneke deliberately wanted to make this movie look like an arty and pretentious project. I just think that he was a bit too ambitious in his drive to make it all connect in one way or another. By watching the acting you can also see that he wanted his movie to be as normal and as natural as possible. Overall the acting is good. Especially Juliette Binoche did a nice job in my opinion. She understands the way to act naturally without to much extras and knows how to make her characters speak for themselves without having to act in a very obvious and theatrical way. I really appreciate that. But also the other actors did a nice job. I don't know many of them and can't remember I've ever seen them play in another movie but what I said about Binoche also counts for them.All in all this movie shows a portrait of Paris like many people don't want to see it. In this movie you'll not see Paris as the perfect and romantic City of Light. That's an image that only exists in Hollywood with the touristic service of Paris and in the minds of young couples. In reality it is a noisy city full of traffic and hasty people. So in that perspective I must say that Michael Haneke really showed Paris the way it really is. And yes racism also is a part of that just like it is in all the big cities... As a conclusion I would like to say that it is a shame that the story has been divided in so many substories if only the directer had made a choice between some of them and had left the rest out of the movie this might have been a masterpiece because the acting and the idea behind it are really good. Now it's sometimes a bit messy and makes it a lot of the viewers loose all interest. I give this movie a 710.".

You'll get several story lines and none of them will be thoroughly explained or even finished. That means of course that there is a big chance you will not understand it or that you'll have to stay very focused from the beginning until the end. Personally I don't mind watching 'weird' movies with a special concept but I know many people don't like it all that much.Code Inconnu tells the story of several people who don't seem to have anything in common except for the place where they live Paris. But what they don't always know is that their lives are all connected in one way or another.

Man and IllusionBefore humankind there was nature which is pure and true. there are trees and wind and animals and so on. then there are man which is basically another living specie. both animal and human have the same drive sex food shelter etc. the only different between man and animal is the ability to understand sign read semiotic for more understanding thus human being created language painting and symbol and so on. in other word because our brain can perceived sign so we can created ART. Art was created by man since the days of the cave man i.e. cave painting in Lascaux France. did you noticed that there are also cave paintings in the film? Man are proud that we are the only specie that can create and appreciate art but what we didn't realized is that we are also the only specie that have the ability the created the illusionliefalsehood. Because of evolution our unique brain can store memories and emotion mix it up and then created stuffs from it. because of this the more time pass the more we are far away from the truth culture law politic social status etc. are all MANMADE ILLUSION2. Illusion of DualismIt's seems like our perceived reality of duality in nature is embedded in our brain. we separated things into yinyang mentality daynight goodbad manwoman livedeath. one scene in particular shows how Boonmee kill the worms in his tamarind tree because it's pest. then the next scene he show his sister the bee hive and seems very protective of it he explain to his sister to avoid the larvae area on the plate. When he told his sister that his condition is the result of his karma from killing COMMUNIST and PEST his sister replied it's alright because you have good intention. When did killing other being can become good intention? Aren't communist human too? Aren't pests and bees are both insects?3. The role of photographyFilm Memories and RealityRoland Barthes in his book Camera Lucinda explained that a picture creates a falseness in the illusion of 'what is' where 'what was' would be a more accurate description. We can see a lot of scene involved photography from the photos Boonmee shows to his dead wife as a proof of her funeral the obsession of his son before he became a monkey the final scene which Boonmee told the story about his dream etc. this is an important scene we will talk about it later4. In the playground we created the rules then we fought each otherIn the film we see peoples who of separated by this socalled manmade illusion for example different nationalities and spoken languages Thai vs Laos Laos vs French Isan vs. Central Thai etc. If you know little bit about Thai history you will understand that the director also talk about the official vs the people  communism vs democracy?.in the final scene where Boonmee told the story about his dream we see people wearing uniform. They are obviously appointed as SoldierArmy. Then in the next photo we saw these soldiers captured the Monkeys Ghost. If you watch the film until this point by now you should realized that the Monkey ghost is the allegory of the Communist.then in the next photo we saw that the soldier now taking their clothes off and play other kind of war game throwing rock. The most funny thing is in the last photo we saw 2 circles draw on the ground. In my opinion the director suggest that countries border dispute and war are nothing but a child's game.5. Jti literally birth but life is understood as starting at conceptionthe word  in Thai word derived from Sanskrit Jti when translated to English it simply means live. hence the name of the film Uncle Boonmee who can recall his past lives but in fact the word Jati is the term in Buddhism which is not simply translate as live but have a lot more profound meaning. By the way I have the same feeling watching this film and Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey. Maybe because it also dealt with the theme of human condition and transformation but this film is from the Eastern Philosophy point of view of course.".

	schema:headline " Hard to judge  easy to love or hate with passion";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a hard film to rate. It pains me not to have fallen in love with it. Here then are some scattered thoughts of my failed romance. It started with a very sour first date. It also ended there.I went in looking to see a film that won the Golden Palm at Cannes 2010. Knowing this fact and having seen the trailer I went to the theater expecting to see an art house piece with Oriental metaphysical overtones. What I saw was to be sure a decisively original and at times hauntingly beautiful film but one that I found an absolute bore a film that to me seemed a tiresome dysfunctional inchoate potpourri of disjunct elements that never quite flowed together.Perhaps false expectations can ruin a movie. Or perhaps let me hazard the unlikely suggestion there is nothing here to salvage? For let me be clear I wanted to like this film I really did. It is important to reward originality and craftsmanship always. And I respect the film or at least its intentions. But the fact remains here comes the unavoidable brutal decisive fact I didn't like it. I only liked a few scenes here and there. Some parts I hated absolutely loathed. Despite a few glimmerings of genius  and an undoubted air of originality  it seems to be that Uncle Boonmee is a needlessly difficult slowpaced and ultimately unsuccessful film... despite the fact that it gets to a great start and carries a lot of potential all the time. Perhaps the elusive quality mentioned by the highpraise reviewers is a mask behind which there is no greater coherence to be found. Perhaps the inchoate structure and the belaboured pacing are not marks of genius but amateurish vices committed in the name of some grand vision that shall forever remain out of our material reach. I fault this film not because of its weird themes or its occasional dream logic. On the contrary I think that it may even be that the film wasn't weird enough or dreamy enough perhaps this film's use of magic realism is a kind of materialistic trap that forces the movie into long neverending sequences of absolutely no consequence. The main vice of the film is its unadventurous reliance on fixed camera frames and boring dragging shots. Editing between the scenes is tortuously snailpaced and almost morphinemimicking in its soporific entailments.Whatever the reason the film feels too much jumbled together like some heavy stone stuck in a spiritual limbo or a unicorn eating a burger or some such nonsense. Ironically the main stumbling block for the film if you ask me is not its artsiness but its clumsy downtoEarthness. The film seems to be grasping for some supreme realism and materialism underneath its spiritual religious and metaphysical surface. But the result is a kind of Ken Loach of Buddhism a boring materialism under the guise of animistic spiritualism.

So despite my dislike of the film's overall structure I feel that this is an important film and I can easily recommend it to all movie lovers. Everyone remotely interested in film should go and see form their OWN opinion of such a remarkable cinematic piece a film that despite its flaws and vices is undoubtedly a creation of unique character and visionary qualities. Weerasethakul's directorial voice is loud and persistent and its echo will surely be heard for many years to come across the lands  and cinema screens  the world over.Now let him only refine his voice a bit and convince us skeptics.

	onyx:emotionText "This was a hard film to rate. It pains me not to have fallen in love with it. Here then are some scattered thoughts of my failed romance. It started with a very sour first date. It also ended there.I went in looking to see a film that won the Golden Palm at Cannes 2010. Knowing this fact and having seen the trailer I went to the theater expecting to see an art house piece with Oriental metaphysical overtones. What I saw was to be sure a decisively original and at times hauntingly beautiful film but one that I found an absolute bore a film that to me seemed a tiresome dysfunctional inchoate potpourri of disjunct elements that never quite flowed together.Perhaps false expectations can ruin a movie. Or perhaps let me hazard the unlikely suggestion there is nothing here to salvage? For let me be clear I wanted to like this film I really did. It is important to reward originality and craftsmanship always. And I respect the film or at least its intentions. But the fact remains here comes the unavoidable brutal decisive fact I didn't like it. I only liked a few scenes here and there. Some parts I hated absolutely loathed. Despite a few glimmerings of genius  and an undoubted air of originality  it seems to be that Uncle Boonmee is a needlessly difficult slowpaced and ultimately unsuccessful film... despite the fact that it gets to a great start and carries a lot of potential all the time. Perhaps the elusive quality mentioned by the highpraise reviewers is a mask behind which there is no greater coherence to be found. Perhaps the inchoate structure and the belaboured pacing are not marks of genius but amateurish vices committed in the name of some grand vision that shall forever remain out of our material reach. I fault this film not because of its weird themes or its occasional dream logic. On the contrary I think that it may even be that the film wasn't weird enough or dreamy enough perhaps this film's use of magic realism is a kind of materialistic trap that forces the movie into long neverending sequences of absolutely no consequence. The main vice of the film is its unadventurous reliance on fixed camera frames and boring dragging shots. Editing between the scenes is tortuously snailpaced and almost morphinemimicking in its soporific entailments.Whatever the reason the film feels too much jumbled together like some heavy stone stuck in a spiritual limbo or a unicorn eating a burger or some such nonsense. Ironically the main stumbling block for the film if you ask me is not its artsiness but its clumsy downtoEarthness. The film seems to be grasping for some supreme realism and materialism underneath its spiritual religious and metaphysical surface. But the result is a kind of Ken Loach of Buddhism a boring materialism under the guise of animistic spiritualism. Just plain realism without a purpose people doing boring stuff for boring reasons.Or perhaps all this is wrong perhaps all this analysis is useless. Perhaps we are back to false expectations again I expected one thing and saw another. But who cares WHY I didn't like it? Surely all this is uninteresting?

You play a slideshow of these pictures whilst listening to the ominous and atmospheric sounds of the jungle. After about 10 minutes you stop what you're doing and sit in a corner for an hour and a half. Then you go back to your slideshow and sound effects for another 10 minutes. This is the movie in a nutshell.There are some beautiful shots within the movie and it's obvious there was some talent because they make a point to keep these still shots on the screen for as long as possible. The background sounds add a lot to the movie as well but everything else was just plain bad. All of the acting was quiet and monotonous and it didn't make it seem more natural at all.The dialogue was terrible. Nothing made sense. As much as I would love to be even more pretentious about movies than I already am and rave about how people don't understand this movie there actually is really nothing to understand. All of the characters were the same. Any subtleties within them are just projections of the viewer filling in the blanks and believe me they are blank. The majority of the movie was filler.

The dawn of cinema came about as an experience and a work of art much like a painting that people could experience and interpret how they liked. It is great to see film makers in todays commercial age still holding on to that vision and delivering the same.The story if there is one is about the protagonist Boonmee who close to the end of his current life recollects how this one went by with the help of ghosts and spirits of the forest where he lives. He has the ability to go back and forth into his past and future lives and relate his memories.The movie like other moodpieces can be fairly divisive with its audience. People who are not prepared for it will be left confounded whereas a small minority for whom the movie is made will leave the cinema stunned at the experience of it all. Therefore this movie should rather be called an experience instead of a movie.It is a little surprising that it won the Palm D'Or at Cannes but not because it does not deserve it but because it surprises me that the judges actually saw the beauty behind it.

This quote appears on the screen at the start of the film and is indicative of what we'll see. Uncle Boonmee is a farm owner in rural Thailand up in the hills and is dying of kidney disease. In this period of his life visions of past incarnations and other supernatural visions will appear to him. The movie is staggeringly and outrageously beautiful whether it's the way light is falling on coloured mosquito nets in a darkened room or its fractured scatter on a quartz cavern or a vision of a palanquined princess seen through veils being carried through a susurrating forest on a narrow track.Apitchatpong Joe Weerasethakul's profound respect for life comes through well in the film. A recurring theme in his films are medical scenes with the long term ill. This is apparently because he grew up in a hospital both his parents being doctors and so he was very used to seeing sick people. The scenes where Boonmee requires dialysis are therefore very easy and compassionate. The whole movie has a great gentleness as regards miseenscene. You just can't get enough of this stuff simple human scenes where people cuddle and care for one another. I like also how darker things are dealt with elliptically for example a water buffalo at the start which breaks free of it's tether but realises after wandering in the forest that it has nowhere to go and no role to play out. Docile it returns with the farmer who has gone out looking for it. I take that as being allegorical with the dark hulk representing a human spirit in anguish though the straight up incarnation viewpoint is obviously affecting too. One thing Joe said in his QA after the film is that he's very keen on individual interpretations of the film of which he has seen many types so come prepared and be a creative watcher! Boonmee believes he is ill because he killed too many communists and also too many bugs on his farm via the use of chemical pesticides. So the idea of karma runs through the movie as well. A spirit in the movie talks about heaven and says that it's overrated and that nothing ever happens there. I found that quite funny the movie is frequently amusing because I've always thought of the view of heaven by the Abrahamic religions as quite problematic that none of them can really make sense of it of how to frame life once life is gone once the struggle is over.There's homage in the film to the movies that Apitchatpong grew up watching and understanding that this is intentional may help to explain some rather odd special effects. I think as well is helps to have a knowledge of Thai current events and a little history especially with the final scenes.Quite incredibly special like Katie who this is for.".

	schema:reviewBody "This years Palme d'Or winner at the Cannes Film Festival Uncle Boonme Who Can Recall His Past Lives is the story of a man who is dying and as result recalls his past lives and is visited by ghosts and spirits.There are ape spirit creatures who lives in the forest attracted by his sickness he remembers being an ox and a princess we watch a nurse drain some device the ailing Boonme wears fixed to his abdomen.This was the first film I watched at 2010's AFI Film Festival in Los Angeles and it was a start that was not followed easily. The film is strange but the words which feel most appropriate to the film are gentle and mysterious.Boonme's final days are spent with his sister and a nurse and their various supernatural guests. They eat dinner watch films look at photo albums life unfolds but with an awareness of a mysterious shift coming. As death approaches past lives and those human animal or other appear evershifting and inter connected foreign but also familiar like relatives returned after a long absence.Uncle Boonme is the final part of a multiplatform project featuring art installations and short films called The Primitive Installation about Nabua Thailand a region heavily occupied by the Thai army from the 60's to the 80's. Uncle Boonme believes his karma is the result of the part he played in the violence of the past.Director Apichatpong Weerasethakul Joe for short has created a landscape of shadowy jungles intimate bedroom lighting a haunting funny dreamy and wise rhythmic lamentation about modern life it's primitive counter points death change spiritmonkeys and all that good stuff. Uncle Boonme is a fantasy as epic as Souleymane Cisse's Yeelen one luminous to look at and visually wander through with several of Tropical Malady's' most hallucinatory moments appearing strong early in it's opening movements and closing out on notes as elliptical as those of Syndromes And A Century and then there's the final scene compressed into a wonderful kind of epilogue involving a monk that's the most audacious fascinating and best of it's sort since Wes Anderson's Hotel Chevalier.Transformations and contrasts between the ancient and the modern flow into one another from electronic bug zappers to sex with talking cat fish primordial caves to karaoke bars. Dual and multipleroles and states within a single whole are a recurring theme in the film so multiple meanings and readings being generated is little surprise. But though these thoughts rise up haunting us after viewing the images of movement through Nabua's phantom jungles and Boonme's warm goodbyes are what we are left feeling and reeling with.All modern worlds are built on ancient ones all new things have within them older forms. Uncle Boonme is more informed by Buddhist notions of reincarnation the idiosyncratic personality of it's creator and the psychogeography of it's location more than normal concerns about dramatic and character arc. In simpler words...an old man who is dying can recall his past lives. The film is a matter of perception as complex and post modernistglobalized as any experimental narrative in avantgardedom or as mystical and primitive as any ancient Sutra based on the cultural inclinations and presuppositions you bring to the film. In any event is to Joe's continued success and cinemas continued fortune that he so playfully and beautifully can challenge and delight these hybrid perceptions of ours as he does.".

	schema:headline " Uncle Boonmee Who Can Divide a Film Going Audience";
	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to art films there's always been a divide. More casual viewers are more likely to dismiss a lot of them as pretentious and stupid film buffs are more likely to find them beautiful and above anything you'll spend ten to fifteen to watch in a multiplex today. Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives is one of those films however that even divides film buffs amongst themselves. Despite winning Palme D'or the film has many detractors and a 6.6 on this siteas of this review. 6.6 isn't bad but far below what you would expect given some of the praise. So what IS this film exactly?The title character is a man who is slowly dying living out with his family for his remaining days. Those days become consumed by flashbacks to past lives though it's not always clear what that life is or how it relates being visited by the ghost of his wife and trying to plan for his after life. The film has a very loose structure. Many people find the pace unbearably slow I think in part because the film doesn't really build up to anything. To call this film meditative would not be a hyperbole it's a mellow kind of movie. After watching it I felt different like I had been given the world's greatest massage my muscles loosened up and everything it's not like anything I've gotten from a movie before. This is helped by the beautiful scenery and cinematography. This is a movie that if you can't watch it on a big screen with loud speakers should at least be watched in a dark room with headphones if watching on a laptopdesktop. There's little in way of soundtrack except for one beautiful song later in the film but the sounds of nature are beautifully captured.The actual narrative is composed of many smaller stories all of which connect with Boonmee. All of them work on their own level and together do create a low key but very very touching film. the scene where Boonmee talks to the spirit of his wife about the anxiety he used to have giving speeches may be the highlight there though the princess story and the final flashback are also up there.This is a film you have to watch on it's terms. You have to be willing to watch it as a more meditative kind of experience to simply enjoy it the way one might enjoy a hike in the woods of a car ride. If that's not what you want out of a film avoid this at all costs.For me personally I was a little hesitant going in given how divided opinion was but I'm glad I did and will certainly watch again. It's a powerful film. It won't necessarily leave you in tears but it will likely leave an impression on those who gravitate towards things like this.".

I tried desperately to find at least something in Uncle Boonmee to understand other people's pure rapture for it but despite all my effort I just could not. First of all the story is not particularly interesting is it? The better question would be is there even a story? This is a sequence of events that do not carry any message which is not itself a big problem as I have seen plenty of good films without extraordinarily deep idea. But those films were at least incredibly beautiful instead. Some people mention beautiful shots but again I believe Thailand has more to show to the world. Another question keeps bothering me Uncle has been labeled as comedy on IMDb. I would really appreciate if someone could name at least one joke in the whole film. Was it Why do you have such long hair? or maybe Are your thoughts too dirty to be a monk? If that is the case I personally do not find neither of those particularly funny. I have to admit that my sense of humor is quite sophisticated though so maybe this is the problem.And finally to make it even worse the film is unbearably boring with its low intensity and slow motion. Take for instance journey to the cave. I do not see the rationale behind making halfanhour long fragment out of it. Same holds for almost all the other film fragments.".

	schema:headline " Palme d'Or jury con themselves by rewarding work of adolescent selfindulgent Thai director";
	schema:reviewBody "If I didn't read Wikipedia I wouldn't have known that Uncle Boonme who can recall his past lives was the final installment of a multiplatform art project called 'Primitive'. I also had no idea until I read the Wikipedia article that a good part of the film was shot in the northeast Isan region of Thailand close to the Laotian border. Director Apichatpong Weerasethakul has indicated the film echoes other works in the 'Primitive' project which focus on the brutal history of Isan particularly a 1965 crackdown on Communist sympathizers by the Thai Army. But Weerasethakul makes it clear that his primary intent is not to make a political statement.Before understanding what 'Uncle Boonme' is one must examine where director Weerasethakul is coming from. He's really one of these guys who has a penchant for nostalgia. If he was an American filmmaker he probably would be extolling the 'beauty' and 'originality' of old TV shows like 'Ozzie and Harriet'. That's why he shot 'Boonme' in 16 millimeter and wistfully bemoans the use of digital which in his mind has led to the possible extinction of cinema itself. He likes the old Thai TV shows also shot in 16 millimeter where the lines were whispered to the actors who mechanically repeated them. He also admires believe it or not the old movies where monsters were filmed in the dark so the audience can't see the 'cheaply made costumes'. Finally and this is something I did not pick up at all in the theater the film consists of six reels shot in six different cinematic styles. For example one sequence features the stiff acting and classical staging of old Thai cinema.Another penchant Weerasethakul owns up to is that he enjoys long takes. This was perhaps one of the most maddening aspects of Weerasethakul's film. Is it really necessary to hold the camera on a water buffalo or someone driving a car or taking a shower for minutes on end? In essence the director is more interested in indulging his own puerile whim than giving his audience a break.As for the Boonme storyline it's a meandering tale that lacks the basic ingredient of good drama conflict! We're introduced to Boonme an exsoldier in the Thai army who lives on a farm in the countryside is on dialysis and dying of kidney failure. His sisterinlaw Auntie Jen along with Tong a nephew one reviewer stated he was Boonme's cousin come to visit. Bigoted Auntie Jen derides Boonme's housekeeper Jai for being an illegal immigrant from Laos but Boonme defends him as he has been very helpful around the house especially in regards to helping a dying exsoldier.While having dinner on the porch the ghost of Boonme's deceased wife Huay makes an appearance and actually has a conversation with the three living family members. The presence of the unreal Huay undercuts the naturalistic scenes of Boonme coping with a terminal illness. Even more weird is the appearance of Boonme's son Boonsong now transformed into a 'ghost monkey' after running away from his family years ago and mating with a simian female. Boonsong is covered in monkey hair and also sports malevolent looking red eyes reminiscent of Michael Jackson's red eyes in his classic video 'Thriller'.Not much happens after the extraordinary appearance of Huay and Birdsong. There is a strange scene where an aging princess with a complexion that looks like a bad case of acne sees the reflection of herself as a beautiful woman in her younger days in a pool of water. She's serenaded by a catfish while she floats in the water and she tells him that she realizes the younger image is only an illusion. The catfish who is looking more and more like a standin for Uncle Boonme tells her that he's convinced she's the same woman he loved in the past. The woman who may represent Huay insists the catfish's past love is also an illusion. Uncle Boonme has been redirected away from his past materialistic existence to accepting the idea that life is an illusion and one should accept death without fighting it.Jen Tong and Uncle Boonme make a trek to a cave where the uncle claims this is where he is born. He's now in full acceptance of death modehe declares he's neither human or animal man or woman. Boonme dies in the cave and we're treated to an exotic Buddhist funeral. The epilogue finds us back in the material world. Jen and her younger friend Roong are counting funeral contributions in what appears to be a hotel room as a newscast blares on the TV. Tong is now doing service as a monk but has no qualms about taking a shower as Auntie Jen scolds him for leaving the monastery and turning his back on his spiritual commitments.Weerasethakul is a frustrating character. Despite being a wellmeaning fellow he is also selfindulgent. Not everyone will share his love for the creepy conventions of comic books and old Thai TV shows. What's more when one strips away all the hocuspocus Weerasethakul's story is simply about a man who comes to realize that his illness was brought on by living a false life but now can accept death as he is now more attuned to the unending cycles of nature.For me Boonme is only worth watching to catch a glimpse of the natural wonders of Thailand and its vibrant culture. For others since 'Uncle Boombe' has a mystical veneer its simplistic message is mistaken for something much more profound. As a result accolades are heaped upon it including the Palme d'Or. Until the judges stop conning themselves a teenage sensibility will reign supreme at such venerable film festivals as Cannes for many years into the future.".

Boonsong is covered in monkey hair and also sports malevolent looking red eyes reminiscent of Michael Jackson's red eyes in his classic video 'Thriller'.Not much happens after the extraordinary appearance of Huay and Birdsong. There is a strange scene where an aging princess with a complexion that looks like a bad case of acne sees the reflection of herself as a beautiful woman in her younger days in a pool of water. She's serenaded by a catfish while she floats in the water and she tells him that she realizes the younger image is only an illusion. The catfish who is looking more and more like a standin for Uncle Boonme tells her that he's convinced she's the same woman he loved in the past. The woman who may represent Huay insists the catfish's past love is also an illusion. Uncle Boonme has been redirected away from his past materialistic existence to accepting the idea that life is an illusion and one should accept death without fighting it.Jen Tong and Uncle Boonme make a trek to a cave where the uncle claims this is where he is born. He's now in full acceptance of death modehe declares he's neither human or animal man or woman. Boonme dies in the cave and we're treated to an exotic Buddhist funeral. The epilogue finds us back in the material world. Jen and her younger friend Roong are counting funeral contributions in what appears to be a hotel room as a newscast blares on the TV. Tong is now doing service as a monk but has no qualms about taking a shower as Auntie Jen scolds him for leaving the monastery and turning his back on his spiritual commitments.Weerasethakul is a frustrating character. Despite being a wellmeaning fellow he is also selfindulgent. Not everyone will share his love for the creepy conventions of comic books and old Thai TV shows. What's more when one strips away all the hocuspocus Weerasethakul's story is simply about a man who comes to realize that his illness was brought on by living a false life but now can accept death as he is now more attuned to the unending cycles of nature.For me Boonme is only worth watching to catch a glimpse of the natural wonders of Thailand and its vibrant culture. For others since 'Uncle Boombe' has a mystical veneer its simplistic message is mistaken for something much more profound. As a result accolades are heaped upon it including the Palme d'Or. Until the judges stop conning themselves a teenage sensibility will reign supreme at such venerable film festivals as Cannes for many years into the future.";

That said my wife and I were curious about a Thai made film which had won a prestigious award from the Cannes Film Festival. Unfortunately we were both quite disappointed in the film which seemed to wander from scene to scene with little cohesion. In particular the closing scene left us wondering what that was all about. I agree with the reviewers who wonder what the Cannes judges were thinking when they gave this film the top award. The director succeeded in making a very unique film although I am not sure why it would appeal to anyone.".

Not many movies achieve this level of pain so easily.Hauntingly beautiful? I am sorry there is really nothing beautiful in this movie anyone who has seen movies by Kurosawa or Andrey Tarkowsky will know what beautiful can mean as well as slow but what is the beauty of an under lit minute long shot of a cow sorry of course water buffalo standing in the greenery or a long cave sequence which I probably could have filmed better with my Iphone? This whole movie is a joke and a cruel one at that.Which makes me think the opening sequence shows a lot of cultural organization which supported this movie I guess apart from moral support this would finally boil down to money. In that sense this movie must have been a successful business venture since how much could it possibly cost to film a naked guy under a shower for minutes or some blurry stumbling around in a cave which goes on forever and for which obviously the first take was used for the movie. I guess with enough chuzpe it would be possible to crawl around under the cutting tables of other directors pick up the rejects and make successful award winning movies as long as a cultural metastructure is provided to put all the suffering of the unsuspecting movie viewer into context.Which seems to have worked very well in this case considering the positive reviews and the Palme D'Or.

	schema:reviewBody "For those who have not heard of Thai filmmaker and artist Apichatpong Weerasethakul I guess you must have heard of his latest film Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives winning the Palme d'Or at last year's Cannes Film Festival and being the first Southeast Asian director to do so. That should interest you to take that leap of faith to experience the coming of Uncle Boonmee yourself and that feeling of being frustrated yet enthralled fascinated yet perplexed all at the same time fighting to stay engaged and making sense of the visuals flitting around dreamscapes.This film is like a diamond with many different cuts made to make it shine each representing a facet from which you can choose to look at or interpret from. Like a prism which dissipates light shone on it your take on this film will likely be entirely different from mine and what more you'll probably have different takes on each of the different aspects of the film since the scenes that make it up are as disparate as can be. It makes the film going experience a little more interesting since it's open and never crystal clear given the takeaways for one based on one's journey in life thus far.At its crux the story is exactly that of its title where we see Uncle Boonmee Thanapat Saisaymar living the last days of his life with kidney failure choosing like most Asians do with the preference to live out the last days at the comfort of one's home rather than at a sterile hospital. It is said that those on the death bed will see their life flash pass their eyes but for Uncle Boonmee his plodding walk toward the light at the end of the tunnel means giving the film a lot more exploratory path to tread on with a look at what his past lives were as well ranging from the suggested buffalo to even a member of the aristocracy and that much talked about scene with the catfish. Hmm... maybe he could be the catfish too!Things get a lot stranger of course even as it seems that Boonmee can remember his previous lives before reincarnation. As far as my limited grasp of that process goes one has to drink up a liquid that will make you forget what you've gone through and one's karma accumulation has bearings on what next you'll be incarnated with the human form being quite OK rather than an animal. I suppose Boonmee in his previous life did OK to be reincarnated as a human in this life and in his last days get visited by his late wife Natthakarn Aphaiwonk with whom he shares a poignant heartwrenching scene with and also a visit from his son Geerasak Kulhong behind heavy makeup whom you'd have already have an idea of from the various promotional material and no he's not captured in a picture just because the camera did not have an antired eye function.Don't be shy if you don't understand the film. For starters I suppose any film based on dreams and fantasy opens itself up to a lot of leeway in interpretation and not taking everything verbatim verbose or literal. Even the auteur himself has said that you don't need to understand everything in an interview with The Guardian probably a relief for those like me who emerged from the screening with more questions than to know where to begin asking them. Like most art films this one moves at a leisurely pace and is filled with plenty of art house sensibilities and techniques and while I won't say will reward the patient viewer it will challenge you to think through about what you've just seen and I felt it was easier to make sense of individual scenes than as a whole when trying to fit the jigsaw in a coherent fashion.To paraphrase Bruce Lee this film is like water having no form of its own yet taking up form based on the viewer's individual experience and interpretation. I guess that's what makes Uncle Boonmee unique coming from a filmmaker who's bold to conceptualize this piece of art that works itself through different strokes for different folks.".

Magic coincidence.This movie has absolutely nothing interesting about it. It does not have beautiful sceneries. It's shot almost entirely within the jungle a regular jungle not some magic beautiful jungle. It's very dark most of time so you cant' really see anything. The characters are lame. The dialogs are stupid and pointless  holds absolutely NOTHING worth debating. Critics talking about Buddhism philosophy and such should sit a while and study those subjects and movies that REALLY accomplishes something in those subjects instead of bullshitting about this movie being philosophic.There's nothing poetic about being pointless and lame. To make things worse the movie presents absurd characters that adds absolutely nothing to the plot oh sorry I forgot there is no plot.I feel really sorry for everyone who sits for more than two hours ENDURING this movie just because they don't wanna feel bad and walkout on a critically acclaimed picture.

Over dinner one night the ghost of  Boonmee's wife appears who thanks her sister for looking after her  husband and tells him he has nothing to fear. The surrealism continues  as an ominous dark creature with bright vivid red eyes appears and  enters the room startling the group but this 'monkey ghost' is  actually the missing son of Boonmee.  The film's story changes suddenly as we see a princess ashamed of her  looks bath in a pool where she offers jewels to a catfish in the hope  she will become beautiful and the catfish commits oral sex on the  princess. We are then back with Boonmee as wife's ghost leads them  through the jungle into a cave where Boonmee declares he was born. They  fall asleep and when they awake Boonmee is dead. A Buddhist funeral  follows and then the nephew niece and sister in law sit in a hotel  room contemplating life after the death of their loved one.  This Thai film won the Palme D'Or at Cannes in 2010 and has divided  audiences ever since. The film is a reflection on life and death and  has many hidden meanings which for those of Buddhist mind may  understand more than others. it starts very conventionally even if a  long languid scene of a cow seems irrelevant but perhaps the cow is on  of Boonmee's past lives. Beautifully shot the lush of the natural  surrounds are complemented by outstanding performances from the Thai  cast with their softly spoken rhythmic language. When ghosts and monkey  ghosts appear things becomes surreal and amusing the reactions of the  family are priceless with the sister in law questioning why the son  the monkey ghost has grown his hair so long received one of the  bigger laughs. Yet among the surrealism there are moments of pure  beauty such as when they eat the honey from the bee hive.  The shift in story to the princess seems to break the flow of the  film it perhaps suggests this is Boonmee recalling one of his past  lives but it does so ambiguously perhaps he was the princess or  perhaps he was the catfish. When we return to Boonmee his time is  limited and yet there is no sadness and if anything his death is  expected making the event less than tragic.  Hints at racism the sister in law's dislike and fear of Laotian's as  well as the tragedy of war Boonmee recalling fighting against the  communists suggests that beneath the surface there are deeper elements  waiting to be discovered should the audience want to delve in deeper.  But even if you don't this is a very well made albeit ultimately  arthouse cinema that as much entertains as it does confound.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see 'Uncle Boonmee' with a friend. We desperately tried to stop laughing but we couldn't.It is quite simply the worst film I have seen in the past year. Art it is not because art speaks to the soul. This travesty merely mumbles idiocies through drugdampened lips. There is no narrative which wouldn't be a problem if the experience was sufficiently diverting in other ways... but it isn't. There is little dialogue which wouldn't be a problem if meaning was conveyed in any other way... but it isn't. The performances are frankly dire and what dialogue the actors have is selfconsciously meaningless.In the film's favour are two things First the soundtrack. There's virtually none of it but when it pops up with forest sounds or Carpenteresque ominous tones it works well to establish mood. For this I award the film 2 out of 10.Second the landscape. Thailand is beautiful... But shots are held longer than they should be held this is the overlong holiday footage of someone in love with Thailand interspersed with the pseudophilosophical musings of an arrested adolescent seeking deep words by throwing darts at a dictionary.The score and reviews this film has collected says a lot about the pretentiousness of those who contributed. This is the art of a Tracey Emin or a Martin Creed. It's the art of ignorant waffling it's the art of the idiot. The emperor has no clothes and 7 out of 10 people so far are simply too wrapped up in selfaggrandising bandwagonjumping to notice.".

It made me very sad and in this convoluted way the film has achieved its goal.Yes it has long scenes in which people stare at each other or at the scenery and nothing happens. Yes it tries to allude to things and some people are trying to guess what alludes to what. Yes it has several styles employed and switches between them. Yes it is intentionally shot on film.But none of this makes it a piece of fine art just yet. Because you know there has to be something else  and there was nothing. Just two hours of boredom.".

	schema:reviewBody "Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives 154 NR  fantasy supernatural bargain basement originalI didn't see this movie in a theater but it had been getting good buzz so I tracked it down on DVD. Some good came out of this as I am now able to warn everybody else away from it.I've got to give the filmmakers credit for daring in being able to cram 20 minutes of what passes for plot into nearly 2 hours of running time. About half an hour in I hit fast forward and watched the rest of the movie at double speed. AFAICT it didn't detract a bit from the story. Due to the exceedingly languid pace of absolutely everything I was easily able to keep up with the sparse and lingering subtitles except when maddeningly they committed the cardinal sin of continuing to use allwhite lettering over a lightcolored background.Everybody in the movie seems to have ODed on Prozac. Nobody has any facial expression or during the time when I had the original sound on vocal inflection. There are vast amounts of standing around interrupted only occasionally by vast amounts of sitting around and lying around. There are extended 28 minute scenes of a guy taking a shower 3 people reclining on a bed watching TV which isn't visible to us people sitting on the floor of a cave people riding in a car bubbles rising thru turbid water and an escaped ox walking thru the forest. During none of these is a single word spoken. In all of them combined the camera moves maybe 5 times. Nor does it feel compelled to switch via either cut or zoom from listeners to speakers. And in case I hadn't stressed it adequately the listeners show absolutely no facial reaction whatsoever to what's being said. None. It's as if they also had massive injections of Botox to go with their Prozac.There is a single action scene. A princess otherwise completely unrelated to the rest of the story wades into a pond discarding jewelry and clothing as she goes does a back float and allows a big catfish to have carnal knowledge of her. The princess is as soporific as all the other humans but at least the fish seemed to be having a good time. More than I can say for me.You remember how everybody smirked at the rubbersuited critters in the early Godzilla movies or the other el cheapo creature features of the 1950s? Those guys would get Academy Awards for costuming compared to the dollarstore discards here.I was half expecting to see Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland jump out at the end and say Hey kids we've been putting on a show with people who have never seen a show before and have no idea how to do one. Hasn't this been fun?No. No it hasn't. Please don't ever do this again.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 2010 Palme d'Or winning Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul has elevated himself into a true visionary of the medium. His oeuvre culminating here in what must be called his magnum opus. Twining politics and intellectualism together by holding his native land close to his heart he explores history memories and cinema itself.Weerasethakul's followup to 2006's Syndromes and a Century follows the final days of Uncle Boonmee Thanapat Saisaymar an ailing old bee farmer who returns to his countryside abode in the northeastern jungles with his sisterinlaw Jen Jenjira Pongpas and a male caretaker Tong Sakda Kaewbuadee. Weerasethakul attributes Boonmee's ailment  kidney failure  with an autobiographical nod to details of his father's own passing. The narrative structure stands at its most absurd but also at its sturdiest when Boonmee's state of mind and body brings forth the ghosts of his demised family members his lost son Boonsong who is now part of the monkey spirits residing in the jungle and has transformed into a striking hirsute crimsoneyed apeman and his dead wife Huay Natthakarn Aphaiwonk who appears at the dinner table in a remarkable scene where the veil between the living and the dead come down in the gentlest way possible.The main scope is limited to these characters as we observe them in moments of gilded reticence as they navigate through this time of great personal revolutions food and final thoughts are divulged until the deep wisdom of the film and filmmaker bubbles up to the fore. Deeply meditative and gentle it brings us on a journey without tugging us along to show us one point after another its mien remains as organic and serene to the nature of the filmmaker and its characters' own journey. Ostensibly a film about transition transmigration and the ontology of our evolution  who we once were who we are now and who or what we will become  Weerasethakul pulls together ancient mysticism and visual cues to form an amorphous narrative that speaks about existence of the living earth and its relationship within and of itself and how environments shape its denizens as individuals. The film contemplates our cosmic existence and attempts as serenely as possible to reassure us that everything is in order that it all makes sense and that we are where we were meant to be. Reconciling his belief in the spirituality infused into nature and its relationship with the human experience his belief in the idea of animism captivates Weerasethakul who regards the reincarnation of the soul and spirit into different forms life never ends and death feeds into the next plane  the renascence of energy and spirit and a transcendence beyond an established ephemeral identity.The song ends but the melody continues to linger  the easy friction between the film's human and spiritual realms proffered by the use of magicrealism is at once supremely stirring as it is assuredly calming. In an excursion by Boonmee into one of his past lives a particularly resplendent vignette of an aging princess yearning to be young once again who offers up her physical self to a talking catfish who promises her the beauty she once possessed. Entrenched with the otherworldliness of a ghostly folk tale from Weerasethakul's own youth and fanciful and erotically charged as Weerasethakul's own recent films it points towards the filmmaker's syncretism of his own fractures memories and refined aesthetics.There is a sense that Weerasethakul set out to make a film about his home and the vanishing spaces that his mind once occupied but along the way stumbled upon the synthetic truth of cinema  the film transforming into an earnest ode to the forgotten national cinema of his youth. He has described it as a way of preserving the memory  the fabric of that point in the nation's cultural landscape  through a hazy melange of related myths idealised imagery and the shared experiences. He uses traditional techniques to create something new and revolutionary eliciting a wonderful sense of exploring and pushing the boundaries of the medium by exploring the metaphysical through cinema and artistic fervour. By invoking the power of the screen and its abilities to meld its spatial and temporal realities with our reality beyond the projection Weerasethakul observes the medium's propensity to not just reflect but alter history and the revision of certain truths.Photographs play a large part of Weerasethakul's ode to permanence and the sense of past lives lived but never forgotten. Time is evoked as a Moebius strip where the past present and future are in concurrent unity when members of his lost family turn up to relive the past or when Boonmee comments on the state of how things were before describing a future existence that begins to look remarkably like a presentday portrait of oppression in the volatile political maladies plaguing Thailand. Weerasethakul slyly alludes to political components inherent in his work  a monk who finds ataraxic comfort in modernity rather than in the austerity of his robes or monkey spirits being led to torture by armed soldiers.Touching on the dark history of the Nabua region it is set in and Boonmee recollecting his own role in the mutual slaughter of the Communists to Jen by invoking karma in considering his current illness that he somehow deserves his fate. Jen responds that she was proud for having her father for serving the nation yet resisted the violence by going into the jungle and hunting animals as well as communicating with them. This symbiosis of regret and avoidance signifying the suppression of violence as a natural impulse of humanity serves great purpose in looking through Weerasethakul's perspective of our natural internal states.".

	schema:headline " The Top ThirtyNine Things I Learned from 2012's Red Dawn";
	schema:reviewBody "1. It never rains in Washington State. Ever.2. While it may seem like a good idea at the time to challenge someone older double your size and obviously a marine you might want to think twice when that someone has also played the god Thor.3. North Korea certainly picked the most opportune time to invade every single United States Military Member was either on vacation or retired.4. Hemsworth seems to like visiting cabins in the woods in 2012. Sadly this one didn't pan out for him like the last one.5. While escaping a North Korean concentration camp bent on converting Americans to their lifestyle it is necessary to run with a randomly and implausibly available American flag to show patriotism in a film that states America abandons its citizens at the first sign of trouble.6. One U.S. missile is used to shoot down just one of the thousands of invading planes and a solitary cop car is on the rescue. Why am I paying taxes again? 7. Planes flying overhead and troops parachuting down somehow and miraculously simulate earthquake tremors that wake our heroes.8. Incredibly rabbit ears still work. And if you believe that lie listen to the news.9. Daryl played by Conner Tom Cruise has a black father. That's gotta raise some questions.10. An Independence Day speech about home does not hold up today.11. One asshole and his buddy can easily take off with all the food that would feed a dozen kids indefinitely while the North Koreans set up shop.12. After ruthlessly invading another country and telling its citizens they are there to install morals somehow people listen. If only it weren't for those meddling kids 13. When in seclusion in a mine shaft cellphone batteries last for weeks while my own needs charging every couple of hours.14. Silently leaving to go grab a beer can be as deadly as crying out I'll be riiiiight back. 15. When one resistance member causes the death of another to save his ungrateful useless and blonde girlfriend he calls family all is forgiven by the fallen's girlfriend with a simple twofinger peace sign.16. And it's socially acceptable to abandon and endanger the rest of the victims on a makeshift prison bus to rescue said dumb blonde as long as it's all about true love. 17. Cramming an entire season of Walking Dead and Falling Skies into one 90minute movie makes you wish for an invasionof any kind.18. Getting shot in the stomach and leaving the bullet intact can't possibly lead to anything bad.19. Hotwiring cars is a snap in movies.20. Tossing trash cans blindly over a fence will always produce the desired car alarm distraction.21. When no one notices two terrorists leaving a business it's reasonable to assume the invaders will automatically find the culprit who aided their escape 22. And when the bad guys do locate that person and stage a public execution it's further plausible that our heroes will know the exact location of the killing and thwart the assassination in perfect harmony.23. Subway restaurants stay fresh while America is invaded.24. When robbing said Subway restaurant combining all fountain drinks into one bucket that's probably used to either mop the floor or gather the puke of unsatisfied Subway customers makes soldiers smile instead of puke themselves.25. Thinking of luring those North Korean soldiers into an alleyway for an amateur ambush? Fear not no one for a mile will hear you discharge multiple machine guns. In an echoing alley. With more guards nearby.26. Trying to remove a truck out of mud? It's always best to have the strongest behind the wheel while the weaklings push.27. Hating kids that are able to blindly leap down three stories and not die by either the fall or two armed guards at their descent is supposed to be funny. I guess.28. Aimlessly wandering and retired military men fill the damnedest of plot holes. Unsuccessfully but still.29. If Tom Cruise believes it worked for Will Smith when he also attempted to make his own son a star in Red Dawn he's probably just jumping on another couch.30. An EMP can apparently shut down not only the country's entire electrical system but also the whole U.S. government armed forces police firemen ambulances backup systems 911 missiles defenses and satellites over a thousand miles up. But it has no effect on cars radios or radio stations.31. Also in time electronics come back online but all the satellites seem to have drifted off to some neighboring galaxy. I suppose.32. Without explanation other than to hurry up the movie a villain can produce the exact location of the heroes' hideout without satellites scouts intel or previous plothole characters directing them.33. Remaking a culthit takes balls. Admitting defeat  iron balls.34. North Korean's fully gassed military vehicles can be folded nicely into soldier's backpacks and used instantaneously when they land.35. Adding Shia LaBeouf's signature line Go!Go!Go! to your script makes one almost want to press stop and plug in Transformers. Almost.36. When selecting a rebellion name one shouldn't pick their own obvious school mascot when trying to avoid detection. Especially when it takes 15 minutes to spraypaint the name on a wall.37. Killing the lights in an isolated cabin in no way makes the place suspicious to the enemy.38. Ending a chaotic and clichd climax inside the very work cubicle of the two main character's murdered father isn't just lazy and predictable it's sad and inadvertently hilarious.39. Hawkeye Pierce would've solved this crisis in less than a 2parter episode. After a few martinis of course.".

This is our back yard and we're going to fight for it or they killed our father we have to fight or die. I'm sure that's what they said in Fallujah too when good ol' George W. sent his invading army to destroy their country. Aaameeerica Aaameeerrrrriiiicaa!! God save them all they do make me laugh and cry at the same time.Enough has already been said in previous reviews about the wildly idiotic plot and lazy directing. Rather get the 1984 version. At least it had some heart in it though the plot was just as ludicrous playing on the strange fear of communism America has always fostered. One more thing! Modern movies this one being no exception way overuse the lazy technique of compressing together various sorts of character growth sequences into a few minutes. It's very annoying and shows a lack of skill on everyones part.".

	schema:headline " Bad doesn't begin to describe how terrible this action movie is  illogical nonsensical and just plain dumb this Dawn deserves never to see the light of day";
	schema:reviewBody "There are big loud and dumb movies and then there are movies like 'Red Dawn' which deserve to belong to a category in themselves for being sheer stupidity magnified. The fact that this was in fact a remake of a 1984 movie that starred the likes of Patrick Swayze C. Thomas Howell Charlie Sheen and Jennifer Grey is no excuse for how blatantly silly the premise is  if you're looking to give it another go the least you can do is to try to make it better.For those who have not heard of that John Milius picture its essential conceit was how a ragtag group of teens become a formidable resistance force when their peaceful community is suddenly attacked by an occupying force. The Russians were the ones unfortunate enough to be vilified then  not surprising given the lingering Cold War fears  but writers Carl Ellsworth and Jeremy Passmore have made the North Koreans the invaders this time round though any real world relevance the opening sequence of edited news footage might suggest the movie would have is quickly thrown out of the window barely ten minutes into the film.After briefly introducing the audience to the pair of brothers  the newly returned Iraq War veteran Jed Eckert Chris Hemsworth and his hotheaded younger brother Matt Josh Peck  the North Koreans are literally dropped into the movie. Waking up the rumble of explosions Jed and Matt are horrified to discover that the sky is dotted with North Korean bombers and scores of soldiers are parachuting into the town in a hostile takeover attempt. If it already sounds unconvincing as we are describing it to you trust us when we tell you it looks even more ridiculous on screen.Are we supposed to believe that within the span of one night the North Koreans have suddenly made their way halfway across the globe to attack America? Are we supposed to believe that they could have come with all that firepower? And worst of all are we supposed to even buy into the fact that they would even bother about a small town called Spokane? Sure we would willingly suspend our disbelief for a movie that bothers to make sense but 'Red Dawn' makes no such attempt and utterly baffles in how it thinks it can get away with such an absurd setup.Does it get better along the way? Absolutely not. Seeing his father executed before their eyes Jed comes to the conclusion that they need to prepare for war  and just like that he becomes training commander of a young team of rebels who call themselves the 'Wolverines'. They learn to fight to shoot and to hide all in the name of preparing to wage an urban guerrilla campaign against the North Koreans who have taken over their town with their arsenal of soldiers jeeps and tanks.And when they are finally ready Matt decides to undermine their plans by scuttling off to rescue his girlfriend Erica Isabel Lucas thereby igniting a brotherly conflict between the rational and responsible Jed and the impulsive and impetuous Matt. What a pathetic attempt at trying to make us care about two stock types who frankly are just in the movie so we have the good guys  the same goes for bringing Toni Adrianne Paliki and Erica into the fray and building some sort of romantic links between Jed and Matt respectively.Even if we accept the tradeoffs in plot and character most Bmovies would have their audience make the least director Dan Bradley could have done is to mount some decently shot action sequences. That is precisely Bradley should have done with his cameraman Mitchell Amundsen  shoot him point blank. Clearly trying too hard to emulate the 'Bourne' films to lend the action a sense of urgency the shaky camerawork is downright frustrating to watch and even more so because the sequences  especially the final one set within a huge circular room fronted on all sides with glass windows  are pretty promising to begin with.No thanks to its abundant flaws the movie also wastes its promising young cast. Hemsworth has good presence as the smart leader of the team he takes over Patrick Swayze's role in the original while Josh Hutcherson who played Peeta in 'The Hunger Games' and here is in C. Thomas Howell's role brings naivety and temperance to the role of Robert Kitner a bookish type who turns warrior because of circumstance. Less convincing is Peck who mostly just looks too stoned to convey any sort of inner dilemma his character is supposed to face.Nonetheless the acting is the least of the flaws in a movie that is painfully illogical and utterly nonsensical. Its invasion scenario might have been able to fly with an audience in the '80s but to try to transplant the same premise to today's context is just plain daftness. Ironically there are some moments that appear to suggest that the filmmakers are wise enough to know not to take the movie too seriously  but those moments fade away as soon as the next unabashed warmongering scene arrives.Don't get us wrong  this isn't about whether we love Baction movies or not. We do but it is movies that insult the intelligence of its audience that we truly detest and 'Red Dawn' is one perfect example of that. Watch only if you need to understand the meaning of stupid.".

Seems that every year Hollywood throws out trash like this fills it with CGI and special effects lot's of fires and explosions and calls it art.A complete waste of time unless you are a male in his early teens.if a movie could get 0 stars that's what I would give this movie.

I have no idea why they chose Josh Peck for one of the male leads. He makes Hayden Christiansen look like Marlon Brando in his prime. Now that I think about it I might even have to suggest seeing that new Twilight instead of this. I know that's pretty extreme but trust me it's really that bad. It also makes sense that this was filmed back in 2009 and just now is being released. In hindsight the studio should've just cut its losses and canned this thing for good. The one positive is perhaps it will cause people to watch the original film from the 80's which is actually watchable.".

	schema:reviewBody "This pitiful remake is nothing more than a hurried excuse to make money off of an 80s action brand that made its money off of the pretty faces that starred in it by doing more of the same. Oh well we've got Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson right? both fine actors by the way. But wait hell with them let's have a greasylooking stonerfaced mumbling Josh Peck as our wartorn hero. These pretty faces fill out the empty space where the rest of the story about a hostile North Korean attack on American soil should be. Wait where's the United States military? Hell with them there's some device that shut them all down and these kids are our last hope! Yeah right. If you can tie an anchor to every last one of your disbeliefs and drown them in the waters of horrible cinema then maybe you can appreciate one or two of the well orchestrated and intense action scenes that Red Dawn 2.0 has to offer. Maybe you can even grow attached to some of the characters. But hell with all that and hell with an ending. That's the reward for your investment.

Oh well we've got Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson right? both fine actors by the way. But wait hell with them let's have a greasylooking stonerfaced mumbling Josh Peck as our wartorn hero. These pretty faces fill out the empty space where the rest of the story about a hostile North Korean attack on American soil should be. Wait where's the United States military? Hell with them there's some device that shut them all down and these kids are our last hope! Yeah right. If you can tie an anchor to every last one of your disbeliefs and drown them in the waters of horrible cinema then maybe you can appreciate one or two of the well orchestrated and intense action scenes that Red Dawn 2.0 has to offer. Maybe you can even grow attached to some of the characters. But hell with all that and hell with an ending. That's the reward for your investment. But hey the studios probably made enough money for a sequel. So there's that.";

The Koreans invade using a top secret EMP weapon that SINKS SUBMARINES oh yeah but leaves all electronics intact and working with no resistance from the armed forces apparently taking everyone by surprise. To remedy the situation US sends 3! marines to take orders from a resistance cell operated by a local high school team in order to retrieve an unhackable device that lets the invading forces communicate with each other during the blackout once again all the electronics still work just fine. They succeed and escape to Canada leaving the insurgent kids alone against the enemy. The Koreans seem to be completely incompetent and untrained Not one of them can hit a target prisoners are rounded up at a high school football team with only a few guards when laying siege to a building they never bother to cover the exits etc. A mysterious Russian guy appears and is immediately identified as a counter insurgency expert. Despite this he appears in the movie exactly twice and both time does nothing. On top of this the product placement is pretty bad at times it seems like the whole flick was shot by using ad money from rolling rock and hammermill. I want my 12 dollars back.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ending on a far more positive note that the first Red Dawn this updated 21st century adaption of that Cold War classic has the USA invaded by North Korea and of course with help from Russia. Interesting how the film was made in 2009 and shelved for two years while we changed the villains from Chinese to North Korean because we have to think of that big Chinese market. That's capitalism at its finest.Geopolitically it doesn't make much sense either. The Russians if anything have become super nationalist with the Russian Orthodox Church having more power than they did with the Czars. I doubt they would be helping the government of the still true believers in Revolution. Ditto the Chinese. Back in the day I remember when one did not refer to mainland China without the prefix Red attached to it. But about 30 seconds after Mao Tsetung could not fog a mirror the revolution was over in China and not a moment too soon. Those who survived Mao's Red Guards could testify to that. Now they're as capitalist as we are with certain lip service paid to Mao just like in Russia lip service to the ideals of Lenin.What these two did do after the fall of the Soviet Union which kept North Korea alive is say you're on your own Kim family and the little family enterprise you call a country. Like Prussia it's a state that supports an army because if you don't join the army you and your family might starve. And now they can't feed their people but they can build their own nukes to threaten all around who enjoy prosperity. That's all of their neighbors.The recent saber rattling of North Korea has given some credence to the popularity of this film as it did in the recent Olympus has fallen. The North Koreans invade thousands of paratroopers over the Pacific rim and we're told that Russians are in the East Coast. They declared cyber warfare by screwing up our military defense systems and invaded.And like the first version some high school kids fight the invaders and they call themselves Wolverines after their football team. The Wolverine which ironically is an endangered species is one fierce animal that never gives up and will take on a bigger foe and win.Unlike the first version the kids are lucky enough to have Chris Hemsworth who was in Iraq to train them. Hemsworth's brother is Josh Peck and they gather a crew together and reek havoc on the occupiers. The action is also located in the Pacific Northwest and the Wolverines do some urban guerrilla warfare. The original story had the kids living and doing their thing in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming.In the original which I liked more than this both Patrick Swayze and C. Thomas Howell were killed and the story had an Ishmael like ending with one Wolverine surviving to tell the tale of the kids who fought back while America regrouped to reclaim itself. This one ended on a more upbeat but false note.Then again it was a far wackier premise with this plot than with the other version.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a remake of a 1980s film where America gets occupied by the Soviet Union and Cuba . Hardly a credible premise but you have to meet it on its own right wing terms . Originally this remake was going to feature an occupation of America by the Chinese . Hardly a credible premise but the fact American films get shown in China nowadays means there's a massive potential market and being worried about losing money the producers then changed the enemy invasion force to the North Koreans . This is where the whole movie collapses from the outset Some people have defended this film on the grounds that such an invasion could be possible down to the fact that NK has an army of one million people under arms . Indeed it does but this misses out that it lacks any logistical capacity . While amateurs talk tactics professionals talk logistics . NK lacks any force projection . By this I mean it lacks any capacity to invade neighbouring countries . It has no real serviceable navy and even a possible invasion of South Korea would involve hundreds of thousands of troops being transported in either trucks or on foot so any surprise attack on America by NK is laughable . The screenplay does try to get around this unconvincing premise by stating the Koreans have launched an attack by EMP weapons that have destroyed America's communication systems and are are being helped by the Russians though it's never stated why the Russians would be brothers in arms with North Korea John Milius wrote the original RED DAWN as a right wing wish fulfillment . The world has changed beyond all recognition since then so what's the political subtext ? Is there one ? I'm not sure . One of the protagonists is a former veteran of the Iraqi conflict and leading the band of guerrilla fighters he makes the point  When I was abroad we were the good guys because we brought order . Now we're the bad guys because we bring chaos  I fail see the thinking behind this . Ordergood  chaos  bad ? How is that then ? Surely it should be democracy good  tyranny bad ? If you're expecting any profound discussion about the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter you're watching the wrong film because the remake of RED DAWN is more concerned about setting up action packed setpieces where brave Americans kill nasty Asiatic commies Even then the action scenes collapse when you give them any thought . Don't the North Korean soldiers have things like road blocks where anyone passes through has to be searched for weapons ? There's also a lack of internal continuity . You can guarantee that when the script demands it there's literally thousands of NKs patrolling the streets of the city then when the guerrillas launch an attack there's only a handful of North Koreans who are cannon fodder  then the good guys are back in their camp safe and sound . Why didn't the thousands of communists just head them off in the pass ? The original film was bad enough but this one is worse . You can perhaps say this remake has better action scenes but for an action scene to successfully work then there has to still an element of credibility involved and everything about this film lacks any credible element and feels anachronistic in any point it might be making . Indeed in the 1980s American control was criticised in case America became a target of foreign invasion . Try claiming people should be allowed access to guns in case of a sneak attack by North Korea and listen to the laughter".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure why everyone is so hard on this film.. maybe because they were comparing it to the original Red Dawn? Or maybe they were expecting too much? I skimmed through some of the other reviews which all seemed to base their low rating 3 ideas. 1. that it's unlikely North Korea can occupy the US 2. why they would choose to invade a small town 3. and why a band of teenagers would make a difference. Those reasons are irrelevant. If you think of every movie like that there are lots of things that aren't realistic but that doesn't mean the movie can't be entertaining. For example it's unrealistic that Bane can hijack a military plane blow it up and then jump out of it safely onto another plane all in midflight thousands of ft above ground. 1. In the movie they briefly mentioned that the N. Koreans had some kind of new EMP that knocked out the US' communications and equipment. Sure.. that's a far fetch but that's not the point of the movie. The US can attack and occupy other countries so why can't N. Korea with Russian assistance? N. Korea has one of the largest military in the world 2. What city they invaded is not the point either.. they could have made it about Manhattan if that makes you happier. They mentioned that the N. Koreans invaded many parts of the country so this is just one of the places they occupied. Perhaps this small town USA was a geographical location that gave them some kind of vantage point for a region of the country? 3. Why can't a band of rebels even teenagers make a difference? It's not that unbelievable that teenagers can shoot. It's also not that unbelievable that they can organize themselves into an effective force under the right leadership like a marine. They're not trying to say that the group will save the entire country or kill all the invaders in the town. As Chris Hemsworth stated near the beginning of the movie it's moreso that a small group can make a nuisance for the invaders and defeat their spirit. Look at the movie Defiance which is based on a true story. There are also elements of rebellion in other more famous movies like Gladiator The Last Samurai Braveheart etc. Overall I really enjoyed this movie actually despite what others say. I think many people were probably expecting something else and had high hopes and felt disappointed but if you watch this movie without reading any reviews first or criticism you may be entertained!".

But for this type of movie you got to remember that its just about having fun and you will find it entertaining.The big problems you have to overlook is the inconsistency of whether they have power. Its knocked out originally for the attack but then does it ever come back. Some buildings have power some have emergency type lighting some are dark.It would have been nice to keep Robert as the somewhat shy guy turns to bloodlust lunatic like in the original. The scene from the original where he kills daryl is awesome.They definitely lightened things up a bit overall. The original has just about everyone dying and this one only has about 3 or 4 of them getting killed.The gun fights and guerilla attacks are pretty good. They are frequent and keep the pace going pretty well. Of course its nice to have the hottie from Friday Night Lights and Isabel Lucas in the cast. The acting is decent except for a couple weird scenes with Josh Peck. I liked that Helmsworth is back from Iraq which gives the group a little more military background. And as your watching the movie you get a nice patriotic high.I suggest seeing it especially with the other options that are out as long as you can let go of being critical of its flaws and focus on having a good time.".

One rule  Every time you see or hear an overused clich or war trope drink. You'll be soused 15 minutes into the film. On the up side the rest of the movie will probably be better that way.One of my friends that saw the movie with me summed it up nicely. OMG it really is a remake. Up until we actually started watching the movie she had been holding out hope that they had redone the movie and fixed the oh so many problems the first Red Dawn had.The original Red Dawn had its place. I remember seeing it back when it came out. It had all the hot young actors of the day. It's problem wasn't the cast all of them were good actors most when on to long successful careers. I suspect many of the actors from this movie will do the same. I'd tell you who was in it but I suspect they are already hoping that people forget that they were involved. The problem wasn't even the concept. Everyone loves an underdog story and there is nothing more underdoggy than a bunch of high schoolers trying to fight back against overwhelming odds. They could have handled the concept lets be generous and only say A LOT better. To their credit the writers did try to fill in some of the plot holes for the remake.They setting was moved from some agricultural town in Colorado to Spokane which at least has an airbase and decommissioned missile silos that might make it a strategic site if someone was to invade the United States. They also made the point that the kids weren't trying to beat the invaders but act as insurgents making trouble where they could.The new movie does offer a nice training montage and lots of high quality explosions. Sadly the dialogue is just as painful to listen to as it was in the first movie. Too bad they didn't spend a bit less on the pyrotechnics and a little more on the script but hey it does have a lot of things that blow up.BANG! POW! BLAST! And don't forget to drink up because someone is probably saying something cheesy. ".

They did a good job of keeping the story moving forward without getting boring at times like the original tended to be. Having said that there is still enough character development to get to relate to the teens and what they're going through  though the original version did a better job at relaying the struggles and fears of the main characters. There is also a good balance between action and dialogue with a few humorous scenes and also some nods to the original in the form of similar scenes done in different ways.All in all it was an enjoyable film for what it is and even though it had its far fetched moments like the teens jumping down 20 foot heights more than once and just walking away from it or the fact that the North Korean army could stage an invasion of the US the original Chinese army version was more plausible they didn't detract too much from the film. I would say give it a shot if you don't have unrealistic expectations given what kind of film it is and you may be pleasantly surprised. I grew up in the 80s and think some classic films from that era should never be remade but this one was an actual improvement over the original and I don't think it deserves all the hate it's getting.".

People seem so ready to criticise remakes for some reason without giving them a chance. Whether you have seen the 1984 original or not If your a fan of against the odds action flicks you will enjoy this its a great popcorn movie. Some critics  this is what they like to call themselves although I believe they are stuck up adolescents with hardly any worldly experiences say the violence was too toned down.. well boohoo a great movie doesn't need to be gory and contain large amounts of gratuitous violence to be honest some movies do this because they are bad movies and have nothing else to offer.On another note have any of the critics bashing this movie actually watched it from start to finish or have they just flicked through it enabling them to give their review? Here are an few shameful comments from the movie basherswhy would N. Korea invade a small US town..WTF? Duh.. they invaded most of the US... listen to the dialogueWhere is the US Army This was explained in the news footage montage at the start the US army is scattered across the world fighting conflicts in the middle east and other parts of the world... plusthey never expected an attack on their own soilWe couldn't stop laughing when the N. Korea military leader kept yelling The wolverine terrorists are attackingOh yeah and I couldn't stop laughing at your comment! the plot was very simply why couldn't you follow it? these radio transmissions came from the Korean Marine made purposely to cause confusion... plus a little comic relief for the audience the one's paying attention anywayFor the people saying that the story was unbelievable i just don't have anything to say to you retards except... it's a movie it's make believe it's for entertainment.All in all a great popcorn movie does it deserve the 10 I gave it? probably not but a solid 8 easily it gets the 10 the offset the unfounded 1's its been getting... what's wrong with people today".

Whether you have seen the 1984 original or not If your a fan of against the odds action flicks you will enjoy this its a great popcorn movie. Some critics  this is what they like to call themselves although I believe they are stuck up adolescents with hardly any worldly experiences say the violence was too toned down.. well boohoo a great movie doesn't need to be gory and contain large amounts of gratuitous violence to be honest some movies do this because they are bad movies and have nothing else to offer.On another note have any of the critics bashing this movie actually watched it from start to finish or have they just flicked through it enabling them to give their review? Here are an few shameful comments from the movie basherswhy would N. Korea invade a small US town..WTF? Duh.. they invaded most of the US... listen to the dialogueWhere is the US Army This was explained in the news footage montage at the start the US army is scattered across the world fighting conflicts in the middle east and other parts of the world... plusthey never expected an attack on their own soilWe couldn't stop laughing when the N. Korea military leader kept yelling The wolverine terrorists are attackingOh yeah and I couldn't stop laughing at your comment! the plot was very simply why couldn't you follow it? these radio transmissions came from the Korean Marine made purposely to cause confusion... plus a little comic relief for the audience the one's paying attention anywayFor the people saying that the story was unbelievable i just don't have anything to say to you retards except... it's a movie it's make believe it's for entertainment.All in all a great popcorn movie does it deserve the 10 I gave it? probably not but a solid 8 easily it gets the 10 the offset the unfounded 1's its been getting... what's wrong with people today";

A any given moment one or the other of them is probably playing the original Red Dawn which weak as it is is still worlds better than its 2012 remake.No this is not an opinion drawn from a deep well of liberalism as one reviewer  fan seems to think of anyone who hated this movie I'll match my conservative credentials against yours anytime buddy. Sometimes bad is just bad.Sure in a Bmovie action flick one BASED on a threedecadeold Bmovie action flick you have to plan on suspending your disbelief a bit and Red Dawn 2012 certainly DOES ask you to dial back the ol' B.S. filters. That's fine I can do that if there's a good story I'll believe whatever you want for two hours.But that's just the problem. If your idea of a good story means I have to willingly invest myself in the adventures of a group of incredibly stupid people opposing a larger but equallystupid invading force why should I care? It's not a battle of wits between skilled opponents but just watching to see whose stupidity will bite them in the ass first. Will the heroes be caught in the painfullyobvious trap or will they escape thanks to painfullyobvious flaws overlooked by their nemesis? Gee I wonder.And no having an explosion every ten minutes as another fanboy reviewer correctly gushed does not make up for the poor storytelling. I can look up explosions on YouTube if that's all I want. Nor does an overdose of shakycam to the point you sometimes literally could not tell who you were seeing compensate for poorlychoreographed action scenes. At best it is a failed attempt to disguise how bad those scenes are.Naturally having nothing worthwhile to do must make acting pretty tough but I'm not sure many of these people could have done any better no matter whose writing and direction they used. Chris Hemsworth will never do Shakespeare if there is a merciful God but he has proved that he is up to the challenge of a good action film The Avengers Thor Snow White and the Huntsman but here he looks understandably bored. The usually excellent Brett Cullen wisely gets himself killed early in the film before it can stain his career too badly. And Josh Hutcherson late of The Hunger Games does OK with what he is given in a small role he'll be one to watch once he outgrows his juniorhigh looks. But the remainder of the cast especially  and I cannot overstate ESPECIALLY Drakeand Josh Peck should really look for other work. Please Josh we're begging here. A career in fast food prep is just waiting for you. SPOILER ALERT if anyone could REALLY give a damn  The biggest entertainment value of this badly written poorly acted shakilyfilmed movie will come within a few minutes of the end. If you've EVER seen an action movie director try to cram some pathos into a script you should be able to call within SECONDS when Jed will die. Compete with your friends! See how close you can come! If you're more than five seconds off you're just not paying attention. But don't feel bad for Hemsworth when this happens. Envy him he's finally free.".

Besides Valley of Flowers invents its own genre thus it is nonclassifiable.It is not often that such films are made slightly ahead of its time Valley of Flowers will neither be commercial enough for Hollywood nor arty enough for auteur driven festivals.But Valley of Flowers personally speaking will have an important role to play in evolution of Indian and Asian cinema.Don't miss it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday I had an opportunity to attend the private screening of integral version of Valley of Flowers 155minutes!! in the chick Planet Hollywood on ChampsElysees in Paris. The film made huge impact on me. A week earlier I saw The Fountain 2006 by Darren Aronofsky. I liked the Fountain as well but it is Valley of Flowers sent my brain spinning.The reason I mentioned the Fountain is because I was struck by the similarities of the theme in these two movies love across ages death and immortality man's fight against time Human beings in constant state of seeking equilibrium in love life nature and human nature.Both Aronofsky and Nalin are known for invading the unknown realms of the real and surreal world. Though Valley is just a second feature of Pan Nalin but the maturity he displays in handling of his subject matter is truly astounding. Valley of Flowers is truly an independent film compare to giant 35million dollar Fountain with star cast. Fountain is witnessing a vast release worldwide. Meanwhile Valley might not even make it to our domestic screen here in US. However It is Nalin's film which stirred me so deep I felt a true sense of unearthing and that made me write my very first comment on IMDb. I know nothing about Buddhism or Yeti or Tibet or Himalaya. But that did not matter the film gave me enough to chew. Of course the Himalayan parts are breathtaking like in his earlier Samsara 2001 but here the landscapes of faces of Bandits are awesome. Costume and Production design are topnotch aesthetics better and higher than many multimillion dollar Hollywood blockbusters.Nalin's cinematic sense and certain trance like camera movements are evocative his girls are divine even though they are playing demon. Again like in Samsara Nalin discovers Mylene Jampanoi a French Chinese actress gets a break to do her first feature. Nalin auditioned several hundreds across the world before discovering Mylene. Indian actor Milind Soman is less impressive but Naseeruddin Shah again proves his talent as one of the greatest actor of Asian cinema in his brilliant interpretation of yeti.Nalin also proves his talent as an extraordinary screenwriter he wrote both Samsara and Valley of Flowers. His cinematic structures do not follow any recognizable genre or style. His dialogs and editing is constantly breaking rules must mention an amazing scene of hero's time walk in Valley of Flowers with simple cuts on pair of feet walking from early 19th century to modern day Tokyo. This scene in itself is a cinematic poetry in the realms of Rilke or Rumi.I've been professor of Japanese Culture and society and dealt with many of the themes of Pan Nalin's movies. Nalin's portrayal of modern day Tokyo makes keen observation about existence of superstitions demon and notion of death in Japan. Nalin manages to penetrate the layers of modern day Japanese life very effectively. Unfortunately in the Fountain Aronofsky fails to display similar command in scenes of ancient Spain and modern day medicine episode.Again it is amazing coincidence how Aronofsky and Pan Nalin both these young filmmakers chose their hero in modern times to be a Doctor. Controversial Dr. Zinelli of Dignitas of Zurich who assisted several people in their voluntary death inspires Nalin's modern day hero. Meanwhile Aronofsky's hero researches to fight cancer. Again Nalin's episode in modern day Tokyo leads to a sublime conclusion of the story where many twists are revealed love and lovers are sacrificed in some of the most poetic and memorable scenes in history of modernAsian cinema.I ask this question several times to myself why the festivals like Cannes Venice Berlin or Pusan have failed to highlight this talented filmmaker from India. I've been huge fan of Satyaji Ray but now nearly 50 years later there is a filmmaker emerging from India with a new voice and new style new energy  a truly modern and universal filmmaker. I am sorry to say there have been many others in between like Mira Nair or Shyam Benegal or Das Gupta but Pan Nalin is beyond he is in another league all together. With his two features I have this intuition that there is something churning within this filmmaker like a volcano. The day that volcano finds voice we will witness an existence and acknowledgment of a brilliant filmmaker. Is anyone listening in Hollywood?".

	schema:reviewBody "Valley of Flowers got me all excited as it was the very first public screening in Delhi's packed Siri Fort Audi where audience was spilling all over the floor... Spectators were made of all races many from abroad to participate in Cinefan. Among them India's who'swho film stars ministers ambassadors business tycoons designers software giants painters musicians writers and loads of young people.Film did get mixed reactions however I did not allow myself to be influenced by other's opinion. Something strong certainly happened to me when the lights came on as if I was coming out of hypnosis. I even forgot to give a round of applause.The film surely has something and I haven't figured out what? At 155 minutes it is long has certain problems badly subtitled and weak in parts. But I am astonished at the story characters and cinematic style. Pan Nalin with his second feature after Samsara makes a very bold step in unexplored territories and comes out strong as a scriptwriter with guts a director with exceptional talent and a filmmaker to watch out for. Just for all those reasons I have generously given 10 out of 10.Film's plot is both complex and simple. It might not be for everyone but it's truly worth the viewing. Rarely a theme of love longing and immortality has been so well depicted before. Valley is a hymn to harmony in nature balance among demons and humans good and evil life and death black and white. It is a poetic telling of reincarnation and karma. Valley is a magnificent house filmmaker invites us inside with warm Asian hospitality but does not give us keys to all the doors. Now for some that will be a negative thing and for others it would be positive. Because Pan Nalin allows audience to interact with this epic love story in honest manner.There are breathtaking moments in Valley like appearance of Ushna levitated lovemaking valley of silence timewalk and final climax in Japan. Cinematography is superb and the casting is near perfect. Himalayan landscapes are awesome. Towards the end the entire resolution of the saga happens in modernday Tokyo and that is destructive and divine like most Asian myths. Pan Nalin's regard on Tokyo and Japan is very sensitive and subtle.Watching Valley is truly a cinematic experience of unforgettable kind I highly recommend to those who love traveling beyond mainstream".

	schema:reviewBody "I am probably the only person who has seen TWO Valley of Flowers the one I saw in Delhi and second I saw today here in Turkey at the Gala premiere of Eurasian Film Festival where Valley.. is competing with some of the best films from Europe and Asia.In Delhi I had really loved the movie thus here in Antalya I wanted to go and see it again with friends but little did I know that the film was violently butchered down by good 40 minutes from its original version!!Here I disliked the film.Does anyone know why? OR is it one of those same old song of creative differences where producers and distributors get to chop movies to make them commercially viable?!If that is the case then it is sad. Because the director's cut was long but played hypnotically well for me. The film's theme is powerful and rare. And I agree with other comments that the film will have tough time finding its audience. However I do NOT agree with the comments from ChomChom India it sounds more like Jealousy or Bitterness then a serious comment. And ChomChom from India should not generalise I was also present at the very same screening and me and my friends loved the picture.Pan Nalin's Valley of Flowers would surely add a new angle to many Buddhism based movies. The whole idea of impermanence and laws of karma is portrayed in delightful modern way. Valley has Japanese MANGA like quality and interwoven web of deep Asian philosophy. The film is full of codes most are difficult to decipher unless you pay close attention. Followers of Eastern Religion and Philosophy will be able to point out these symbols.Another reason I loved Valley... is because it reminded me of Antonioni's The Passenger the lead Jack Nicholson plays reporter who does his time in the desert and steals identity of a dead arm trafficker. Then he meets Maria Schneider character love blossoms and together they travel into the oblivion... Like Jelan and Usna of Valley of Flowers.Nalin manages to render his story with shades of greys and black. He keeps on fighting with the pace like a warrior but does not succeed. However he leaves you with unforgettable impressions poetry ideas...If you do get opportunity to see Valley's Director's Cut don't miss it. However If you are going to see the butchered version of 2hr then you better visit the official website of the film www.valleyofflowers.com and understand the story and background. If not you just MIGHT not get it like ChomChom from India.".

The film opens in the Himilayas at 16000' altitude and proceeds to take you higher and higher. After 2 12 hours you wish it would not end. Not only the landscape of the mountain passes but the real people who live there made my eyes want to be able to see more deeper faster with greater ability to never forget what I saw. I'm really confident that this film will stand the test of time on that issue. It is a story that I would not believe could be told on film being down and dirty exotic real life and at the same time an uplifting spiritual experience. I'll see it again as soon as they get a distributor.".

Valley of Flowers makes you dream. Its a romanticism with layers of fear fear of life death demon rebirth...It's set in very romantic Himalayas and moves onto very seductive Tokyo. Girls are gorgeous! Guys are cool and Game is dangerous that of human vs demon.All that unfolds in magnificent vistas amazing locations. The film has great production value and specially the costume design is exquisite!Extra bonus it is inspired from Alexandra David Neel's book. Thus it is real treat for the fan of Alexandra's dark world of magic and mysteries of Tibet and Himalayas.In Japanese part of the movie when film slides into modern world from early 19th century there is also a wonderful scene with BARDO Tibetan Book of The Dead based euthanasia.Its great concept what do you do once you become immortal and you can not die help others die.It's not so often we see in cinema Asian interpretation of love. Valley of Flowers is to be watched with open mind. It is not an easy film mind you.Valley of Flowers is slow and I like slow movies I cant bear Hollywood's fast cutting any longer.The only problem with valley of Flowers is that it is loaded with too many great ideas and concepts many don't succeed. Maybe it is an overambitious adventure from writer director Pan Nalin whose SAMSARA is my all time favorite film. SAMSARA is in my list of 10 movies to watch before you die.Sorry Valley of Flowers is not in that list but its a brilliant attempt towards unknown. Pan Nalin is a rising sun of the east in just two feature films he has proved talent worth of five features. I agree he is a filmmaker to watch out for.For Valley of Flowers If you live on popular cinema then avoid it. But if you are in mood to let your mind do gymnastic then I would say JUST GO FOR IT! It is a rare kind of movie. It has a magic and mystery and lots of sensuality.".

It plays beyond two and half hours and apparently theatrical released version is shorter by some 3040 minutes.I've immensely enjoyed this stunning film. I'm happy to ignore the weaknesses in editing and acting but my full marks goes to its daring originality innovative theme and unexplored locations.Somehow the film compelled me to return to the cinema for a second viewing. Second time to my surprise I enjoyed the film even more. And I did not even find it longer.Personally I have not heard about this director or seen any of his earlier films but one thing is certain that his command on the craft of filmmaking is of top level. His grasp of cinematic styles and sound design shows sensitive and perceptive mind he posses.He truly masters the valley of silence sequence in the film. This scene alone is something one has never seen in films before. No music no sound effects no folyes... and the filmmaker carries the scene breathtakingly well. And manages to keep the spectators on the edge of their seat.Another great achievement is time walk sequence creation of the character of Yeti also deserves a special mention.Two Ushnas are Devin and sexy. The ambiance of Tokyo scenes is hauntingly beautiful. The filmmaker does not waste any time by showing us cityscapes and establishing shots  instead he remains focused on Jalan's loneliness  immortality.My favorite part is the end but should not be revealed. The last image of Yeti's feet taking a time walk but in the opposite direction the nature's balance is restored is one of the most satisfactory and subtle end in recent cinematic history.Like others I fail to understand why no one is talking about this film? Why is it not shown in some high profile festivals? This films deserves a big release as big as its canvas is.I fail to understand why there is no promotion at all except the odd and meaningless poster we have seen here in Russia?Are we the few odd users to love this film? or we are just simply nuts.".

Thus I would only add that Nalin has played with very dangerous theme and cinematic structure he comes out as truly talented director a filmmaker with vision.But these days the film journalism and criticism is not a pleasant place to be. It is often short sighted and fails to see a great talent behind each work.My curiosity lead me to spend days and weeks to get hold of some of the remarkable films made by Pan Nalin prior to SAMSARA.When Pan Nalin was barely 20 years of age he made breathtaking 20 minute short fiction titled KHAJURAHO. This short film is excellent has a vision a unique vision. Shot in CinemaScope and Black and White it is a sheer poetry in motion. Whether we like it or not a director was born that day.Apparently Nalin made many silent shorts between the age of 16 to 20 but KHAJURAHO was the first film he was able to complete. I could not track any of his earlier works.Later Nalin and his crew put their lives in danger when they went to shoot NAGAS a documentary on wildest of tribe of NorthEastern India. No filmmaker had ventured there before and after since the Naga was made in 1995. Similar attempt were made while making simple but bold documentaries like TULKUS or DEVADASIS. I was surprised to read some negative criticism on the Net about recent works of Pan Nalin. Valley of Flowers is his only second feature!!! Come on give this guy a break!!!Most of the film critics failed to remember that what was the first and second films of Hitchcock Kurosawa Wong Kar Wai Bergman Antonioni.... were like???I am not hear to defend Pan Nalin whoever he maybe but filmmakers in General. First and Second and even third movies of film directors are often like Soparano Singers shaping the color of hisher voice. Give those guys some time. They will master melodies which will move you to tears if not you have a right to massacre them!Filmmaker like Pan Nalin if they were in Hollywood making English language movies they would have got much better attention.We should remember how hard it is to make an original work of cinema in Asia or Africa. Often you are not only struggling to make the film of your dream but also trying to feed the family of fifteen at same time!Someone like Pan Nalin are gifted to give us a meaningful entertainment. They are capable of pulling the best out of Hollywood. Remember very rarely a Hollywood director will write his own script. Nalin has proved his talent for excellent screen writing with both SAMSARA and VALLEY OF FLOWERS.Directors like Pan Nalin are truly International Director in the line of Inarritu or Meirelles They make the new cinema new entertainment and new world we live in  a most fascinating place to be enjoy and celebrate the life the way it is and not the way you are.".

The first thing that stands out about this movie is Pan Nalin's superb direction and breathtaking cinematography which depicts the 19th century Himalayas like never before in the first half of the film. However the storyline was also quite slowpaced in the first half.

The first thing that stands out about this movie is Pan Nalin's superb direction and breathtaking cinematography which depicts the 19th century Himalayas like never before in the first half of the film. However the storyline was also quite slowpaced in the first half.

	schema:reviewBody "I happened to see this film in Paris with few friends. The film was subtitled in French and I do not speak or read French. But to my surprise the film grabbed my attention than slowly my mind mysteriously... as it turned poetic and touching I was in the VALLEY OF FLOWERS not wanting to go out and face the French arrogance...It is almost meaningless to try to ascertain any scientific or cultural logic beneath the surface of this allegorical story inspired from Alexandra David Neel's work. Such hairsplitting will only make you lose the merit of this work.The film commences in early 19th Century in the Himalayas a gang of bandits wait for their attack. We are almost in Sergio Leone feel... After the attack the chief of bandit falls for a mysterious victim. Now begins a great love story as they go on pillaging silk route... Soon comes the Sherrif and he is going to get the outlaws...Lovers after savoring material wealth leap into supernatural thefts the chase continues... I will not reveal all but finally two centuries later ends in Tokyo of today.There are many themes which touches all of us the film remains universal and will surely strike US audience with its magical spell. After all it is very modern and new age. Somewhat BABEL or THE FOUNTAIN like.Already there is great concept great style and great photography. This story would make a fantastic American remake. Imagine 2 centuries ago the Grand Canryon a group of outlaws attack Navajo or Hopi Indians One of the Outlaw falls in love with a mysterious Indian girl. Together they rob the wild west. Then comes the bounty hunter or sheriff. The chase begins. But soon the mysterious Indian girl leads our hero to supernatural robberies with voodoo and black magic of Indians thrown in they robe vital energies luck and ultimately they want to become Immortal. They find in a far far land a Hualapai holy man and steal from him the elixir of immortality. It works on him but she dies. Tragedy. He will live on with his suffering and longing... cut to modern day NYC where our hero is 197 years of age!!!! Isn't that great? Use your imagination and you will see this will make a superb remake about love longing and death. I agree it is better plot than The Fountain 2006Sorry writer in me took off. But that is the proof there are rare movies in the world today which can inspire you or fire up your imagination. Do not miss Valley of Flowers mind you it is not a perfect film it has it weaknesses. But it is indeed a haunting film. Valley is also a philosophical journey through the ideas of life love loss and hope.Valley of Flowers provokes something very human out of its viewers. I can remember being one of the few in the audience having had a full house in the beginning and still watching the credits roll sharing a strange sensation. It wasn't joy. It wasn't sorrow. It was just feeling a part of something that I can't explain and I think just for that this movie is something quite remarkable for being able to do that.".

The beautiful gay Turk who cannot accept himself the questioning sensitive and beautiful gay boy trying to find himself and the truth of his family the wonderfully portrayed German Aristocrat and his oh so proper mother the gay Aryan boy struggling to prove himself to his thug friends all combine to make a complex and enthralling film. The script is intriguing and contains many surprises. The strength of character that most of the gay players the drag queens and Murat especially exhibit is inspiring. The style of the film is dark and disturbing showing an aspect of the new Germany that you won't see in any travel brochures.Raw emotion has rarely been portrayed so effectively on screen.I am puzzled that this movie has not made a bigger splash worldwide.

	schema:reviewBody "Lola  Bilidikid Lola and Billy the Kid written and directed by the dynamic E. Kutlug Ataman is an immensely interesting view of the lives of Turks in Berlin. The many characters introduced at a seemingly random fashion all are woven in the loom of Ataman becoming one connected tapestry of ethnic clashes humor drama and intensely moving views of family and love. From the quiet moments at the beginning to the unexpected ending this film dazzles with color music highly developed character development by some fine actors and edge of the seat tension.The Turkish subculture in Berlin is the hotbed for trouble between Turks and Germans. Add to this setting the fact that the film deals with the taboos of gay life transgender and transvestite men and the concomitant stresses of families who deal with these issues on a daily basis and the result is a film full of richly detailed stories.Lola Gandi Mukli a Turkish drag queen has a lover Billy the Kid Erdal Yildiz a macho closeted Turk who views his role as the Man and Lola as the woman and encourages Lola to have gender altering surgery so they can live as husband and wife back in Turkey. Murat Baki Davrak is Lola's baby brother also gay living with his mother and older brother Osman Hasan Ali Mete who disowned Lola for his proclivities. After 15 years Lola returns home to demand his inheritance share to proceed with his sex change and reunites with Murat eventually revealing murky family secrets the results are tragic to all involved. This is the main story of the film. But there are many others! There is a fascinating relationship between another Turk Iskender Murat Yilmaz who is picked up by an older elegant German Friedrich Michael Gerber whose affair meets with challenges from his aged but grand mother Ute a marvelous Inge Keller!. And there is the gay bashing drama between young German lads and the Turks which instead of being simply an evil tragedy is a character study of why gay bashing occurs the main perpetrator is ambivalent about his own sexuality and the way this story plays out is both gruesome and heartbreaking.Yes there are other side stories but suffice it to say that Ataman has created a film mesmerizing in content and production. It is one of those films that pleads to be watched again after the various stories have been told knowledge of the ending events is yet more potent the second time around.

	onyx:emotionText "Lola  Bilidikid Lola and Billy the Kid written and directed by the dynamic E. Kutlug Ataman is an immensely interesting view of the lives of Turks in Berlin. The many characters introduced at a seemingly random fashion all are woven in the loom of Ataman becoming one connected tapestry of ethnic clashes humor drama and intensely moving views of family and love. From the quiet moments at the beginning to the unexpected ending this film dazzles with color music highly developed character development by some fine actors and edge of the seat tension.The Turkish subculture in Berlin is the hotbed for trouble between Turks and Germans. Add to this setting the fact that the film deals with the taboos of gay life transgender and transvestite men and the concomitant stresses of families who deal with these issues on a daily basis and the result is a film full of richly detailed stories.Lola Gandi Mukli a Turkish drag queen has a lover Billy the Kid Erdal Yildiz a macho closeted Turk who views his role as the Man and Lola as the woman and encourages Lola to have gender altering surgery so they can live as husband and wife back in Turkey. Murat Baki Davrak is Lola's baby brother also gay living with his mother and older brother Osman Hasan Ali Mete who disowned Lola for his proclivities. After 15 years Lola returns home to demand his inheritance share to proceed with his sex change and reunites with Murat eventually revealing murky family secrets the results are tragic to all involved.

And watching this movie you see how it gets a million times worse when one or more of the parties involved belong to an extraordinary walk of life in addition to being sided.In fact this movie features quite a few stories at once but doesn't lose the viewer since they're all related in some way or the director has successfully managed to make them somehow related without losing out the plot. All the relationships especially the one between Murat and his revolting brother Osman and the one between the German gay guy and Iskender are really well put. And the tiniest detail on the movie isn't missed. Even the little scene with the hooker is well done.If you're a Hollywood enthusiast leave this movie aside. You'll think it's sick and boring. But if you like good movies made with some feelings and culture rather than expensive effects and those dealing with tender social issues then you'll absolutely love it! It's only for those who can take heavy stuff and have a good taste on cinema. 910 for Lola Und Bilidikid.".

Don't expect a sophisticated plot and a superlative script. Expect a harmless and fun Christmas comedy that way you are in for a good time.While very predictable in plotting and rather repetitive and slow in the middle half especially in the first thirty minutes Ernest Saves Christmas does have its funny moments. And I must say the scene with the magic sleigh was uproariously funny. Amongst the humour is an in general heartwarming story about Santa and his attempts to find a successor.The camerawork may be a tad dated but the music is very nice indeed. And I actually thought the acting is above decent with the late and talented Jim Varney wonderfully spirited as Ernest and Douglas Seale is simply great as Santa. The opening credits with the collage of Christmas carols were a delight.Ernest Saves Christmas is an above average seasonal comedy about the power of belief and the dignity of an individual. It is far from a masterpiece but seriously I wasn't expecting it to be. I got exactly what I wanted a fun film that while predictable and silly is lots of fun too. I do also think it is underrated there are much worse movies out there namely any of the FriedbergSeltzer movies Home Alone 4 and SuperbabiesBaby Geniuses 2. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "First off R.I.P Jim Varney. Jim Varney was the Charles Chaplin of the 1980's  early 1990's. Jim Varney's goofy alter ego Ernest was famous for his trademark slapstick humor countless Bugs Bunny type dress up egos and dumb humor. Despite Ernest being nearly stupid Jim Varney the actor was a high IQ man. Jim Varney was also a serious Shakespearian actor. He was phenomenal and much admired in the 'circle' of Shakespeare on a par with Sir Lawrence Olivier.. He said he loved playing Ernest because it was for him the direct opposite of doing Shakespeare. Ernest first made his mark doing commericals for nearly everything it was his work with CocaCola that allow the Christmas ad's in the opening of the film. It opens up with Santa Claus Douglas Seale arrived at the Orlando Airport. Douglas Seale has one of the sweetest voices and it's works for being Santa Claus. Ernest P. Worrell works as a taxi driver and picks him up. Santa Claus is on his way to get a local celebrity Joe Carruthers to be new Santa Claus due to Douglas thinking of retiring. While they are driving a runaway teenage girl Noelle Parker calling herself Harmony Starr joins Ernest and Santa in the cab. Harmony is a horrible character who lies nonstop on end. However on Christmas eve her conscience prevails and she reforms her ways. Ernest drops him off to meet Joe but Ernest discovers that Santa left his magic sack behind in the cab and Ernest begins a quest to find the old man and return it to him. There is a number of cool scenes in the movie that show Jim Varney's work one is the POV Vern's house which pays tribute to the original commercials that first introduced Ernest the audience never sees Vern's face. The other is when Ernest poses as Astor Clementh an employee of the governor and Harmony as the governor's niece Mindy and the two help Santa escape from jail when Santa got himself locked up by Joe's boss. The other is when Ernest disguises himself as an Apopka snake rancher Lloyd Worrell from Knowhutimean? Hey Vern It's my Family Album who sneaks Santa into a movie studio to find Joe again. There are also supporting cast from his TV show days as Chuck and Bobby Gailard Sartain  Bill Byrge that serves as subplot as two airport workers trying to control Santa's reindeer. The movie has a strong Christmas theme and the humor will keep a range of ages entertained nonetheless. Ernest is funny without using sex. Ernest also use little violence and harsh language. Very heartwarming and works for family events. The cutbacks of the film can be the over used of advertising in this movie and recuts of older commericals good example the pancake on parade dodgy plotpoints and bad Christmas puns. Director John Cherry and Jim Varney made a good movie for such a lowbudget and it's one of the last of the good Ernest movies. Yeah the Ernest movies are pretty much the ultimate in guilty pleasure crapfests but this brings out the Christmas spirit in all of us.".

This is a sweet and fun family film that borrows a bit from Miracle on 34th Street and other holiday flicks. There is only one Ernest of course and Varney provides much comedic mayhem with his unique character. Just watch him talk about channel number 5 perfume or a failure to accumulate and you will be laughing heartily. His expressions are priceless too. The rest of the cast although unknown are fine as well. No one will find fault with the look of the film either as the costumes sets and production values are high. Perhaps you have heard that Varney's humor is sometimes of the grossout nature and you would rather not share his films with your family. Please do reconsider when it comes to this one. Its humor is infectious not offensive and its sweet tale will warm the hearts of its viewers. So make a batch of mulled spiced cider and buttered popcorn and put this one into the home theater machine in the very near future.".

What made the 2 I actually did finish watching different is that they were mildly entertaining fluff that wouldn't irritate adult viewers and actually had some funny bits Ernest Goes to Camp and all the other films I TRIED watching would most certainly irritate most adults. It has some cute moments and I can certainly think of many worse holiday films. It's about the same quality level as the Santa Clause movies. So if your kids want to watch this give it a chance. Yes the humor is rather sophomoric at times but it's not a bad flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hey I'm just being honest. This review is probably less about the actual quality of this movie and more about how it makes me feel because I grew up with Ernest like many of us did. I probably watched Ernest Goes To Camp and this film a thousand times at least not to mention his Saturday morning TV Series. It has been years since I watched any of Ernest's antics and decided to check out the old Christmas classic this year. What a terrific movie for families and what a talent Jim Varney was. Ernest in general and in this movie is so ridiculous campy cheesy and its just the perfect blend of all of that with a healthy dose of true comedy. The movie is cute and fun full of adventure and magic and holiday spirit. It isn't sappy but if you look under the surface there really is a sweet story there and has several different characters going through different things throughout the film. For what some might call a silly comedy it is actually smartly written. It knows exactly its demographic and most importantly it knows what fans of Ernest want to see. It is a Christmas movie at its heart and soul and yet doesn't forget to include everything you love about Ernest and his adventures.I forgot just how amazing Jim Varney was in this role. His physical comedy is really something to see whether he's pretending to be a silly character snake farmer old lady etc or he's on a rant through Vern's house or trying to save a Christmas tree from the highway. He's simple and yet brilliant and full of heart. Its a great character and I forgot just how much I liked him. Ernest is the perfect character to put into a Christmas film and no one could do it like Varney. Not to be outdone the supporting cast is so good in their roles. Douglas Seale is amazing as Santa who is ready to retire and looking for his replacement. He is so out of place in the fast paced world but a strong person who is being treated so poorly. The chemistry with him and Varney is perfect for the film. Oliver Clark is the Mister Rogers type TV personality that Santa wants to replace him. Clark is good although a little toned down compared to some of the other performances in the film. He is still very good in the movie. One of the first crushes I remember having was on Noelle Parker's Harmony. She is a wayward kid that lies and steals and happens to come across Ernest and Santa and learns the errors of her ways. She is the perfect personification of an 80's kid with the side pony and the clothes she wears. She nails the role and while its a very cookie cutter role she is does it well and she's as cute as she was back then. Ernest regulars Bill Byrge and Robert Lesser show up as Bobby and Marty in a silly little side story that happens to be hilarious.I just don't know how anyone can't like this movie. I mean it isn't an Oscar winner and if you're looking for raunchy comedy you won't find it anywhere here at all. This is a clean cut family film with some really smart comedy and brilliantly they made sure John Cherry who is an Ernest director staple direct this one. He has done Ernest films and TV Shows since its conception it would seem and so he knows the character and likely worked well with Varney. If you're going into this with the right expectations you can't possibly be disappointed. If you don't know anything about Ernest or you're expecting some modern day raunch comedy then you'll hate this. This has everything you could possibly want from a comedy like this. I will be making my rounds of Ernest films starting now because I forgot how much I enjoyed the sheer silliness and this will be a Christmas staple in my house for certain. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Boy this is a tough one for me to review but it's one that left an impact on me for sure. The holidays are here again and once upon a time this was my favorite holiday film. I was a youngster to be sure but this goofy thing was always on my holiday viewing. It probably also added to my love of the Santa Claus legend. Now as an adult I was tempted to give this a look through the eyes of an adult. It's not the nicest thing to do because as we age we grow cynical but I really wanted to see this movie again.I don't know what happened but I still got a lot of joy out of it. I won't deny that nostalgia probably fogged my lens but 'Ernest Saves Christmas' genuinely matches all the criteria for a heart warming Christmas film. And now you'll ask me Do you really still enjoy Ernest as a grown man? No not really. Oddly enough Ernest is not what draws me to this movie. The thing I love about this movie is it's portrayal of Santa Claus. Ernest is off the wall goofy but the Santa legend is taken super seriously. Douglas Seale gives in my opinion probably the best portrayal of Santa Claus in any medium.And so there are really two films to be reviewed here. The story of a retiring Santa reluctantly hanging up the sack and Ernest making a goof of himself in the process. I almost wish Ernest himself weren't actually in this movie because the stuff with Santa is so interesting and heartwarming. Can you really hate Ernest though? I don't know. Jim Varney definitely shovels it out and throws everything at the wall in the hopes that something might stick. I guess I'd say he's a low rent hillbilly PeeWee Herman. I was an Ernest fan as a kid though and so I tried to think about what appealed to me back then. Varney just has a manic energy and does anything for a laugh. Children will love him as did I. Is it deep or sophisticated comedy? No. Is it harmless? Yes. Don't get me wrong there are moments when Varney enters Jar Jar Binks territory but the whole thing is meant to be as goofy as possible and I might as well let it slide. I mean it's Christmas right?What makes me love this film is Santa. Santa Claus is an interesting character with a lot of myths surrounding him. 'Ernest Saves Christmas' has the great benefit of having an actor who treats the role like Hamlet and brings out it's intricacies. I love Douglas Seale in this part. It's like the kind of performance where the actor melds with the character. Seale has a genuine joy in the way he describes the actions of Santa Claus. He interacts with every character with kindness love and respect. You would imagine an Ernest film would go for the cheapest laughs but Seales' Santa Claus has nothing but dignity. The plot is a bit contrived but there are stakes here tremendous stakes. Christmas needs to be saved here and that is because of Seale's conveying the plot. Is he manipulating me? I don't know. On paper I imagine this character reads terribly. Santa spends so much of the film doing nothing but delivering exposition. He does so in a way that perfectly captures the essence of the character but also of the other character's he is interacting with. I don't really see a whole lot of worth in the Santa myth. I always thought it was a bad idea to get kids to believe in Santa Claus but this is the Santa Claus I would want to believe in.I'm not going to bother giving this a star rating or going into it's many other flaws. It's a goofy movie but it still had the power to put me in the Christmas spirit. If you can stand a little annoying Ernest comedy than you are treated to a wonderful portrayal of Santa Claus.".

A great acting talent that was sadly wasted and underutilized in a long series of Disney B films. A mixed bagofafilm from the Disney Touchstone logo. It starts out with a cruel edge as cab driver Ernest rushes an obnoxious passenger to the airport in a big Yellow Cab. The passenger wears no seat belt and is bounced around the back seat. He apparently dies or ends up in a catatonic state and Ernest dumps him into the baggage chute along with his ripped luggage. Right up there with the terrible start of The Santa Clause when Santa falls off the roof. It's just not that funny. The other part of the film than stinks is when Joe the exkiddie show host makes a film called Santa Slay which is beyond dreadful. The part that works is the Johnathan Winterslike warehouse man who doesn't know how to deal with 8 flying reindeer and Santa's Elves. Good and bad acting abounds. Santa acts and looks quite genuine and sincere. The teenybopper runaway practically falls out of her peekaboo tanktop shirt. Sure she's cute but distracting. A simple plot as old Santa attempts to passthetorch to a new Santa. The last third of the movie finally redeems itself with wonderful Disney Magic as Ernest truly does save Christmas with Santa's runaway sleigh and 8 hyperactive reindeer. Filmed in Orlando Florida and much of the film looks very cheaply made.".

Clark brings warmth and goodness as the entertainer wrestling with contract issues. Noelle Parker plays the teenage runaway who must comes to terms with decisions that led to her current lifestyle.

And what a breakthrough role for Noelle Parker who went on to star as Amy Fisher and then have her own television series Sisters. I am surprised she not got any bigger than she is... would love to hear her on an audio commentary for this film.";

It's very enjoyable with a good plot even if it borrows from basic Christmas movies a little. One may thus find some of what's in the movie obvious but it is hard to find better Christmas movies to watch on a regular basis. If you have not seen it before I highly recommend it.

I haven't seen this for over twenty years and remember loving and rewatching it so many times back in the late 80s.You know Vern watching these Ernest movies as an adult it's not quite the same effect as viewing them through the eyes of a child. Recently I've been revisiting three of the four I loved or liked as a child Ernest Goes to Camp Ernest Saves Christmas and Ernest Scared Stupid. I have yet to rewatch Ernest Goes to Jail and I will soon. I do have that on BluRay now and that was my personal favorite as a child with this holiday special as 2. And boy I can see how I liked them in my youth and they do have some absolute humor that translates to adults but they are overthetop silly at times.That said there's a purity to them. Ernest er the late and great Jim Varney has such a heart and kept everything in his act and movies clean. I like that. In fact I'm surprised these movies are rated as high as PG. Honestly there's nothing and rightfully so in them that should offend anyone. Thank you Mr. Varney.Here in Ernest Saves Christmas Ernest the GRated but somewhat unsafe taxi driver gets mixed up with the real Santa Claus as he's on a mission to pass the torch onto a new Santa as the magic is up.Naturally things are a lot more complicated as they appear and Ernest screws up a lot but in the end there's the heart and soul of Ernest P. Worrell who brings it all together.While not perfect you gotta admire it for its simplicity in a complicated film. One can criticize Varney's odd facial expressions and zoomins or even dislike them. But he had a heart and he set out to make a what I think should be a GRated special Christmas movie. Mission Accomplished.   Final thoughts Don't get me wrong. This movie is way silly. And I had to endure a few too many madeforyoungercrowds scenes like eyes darting back and forth as a gag. It's okay to get past that when you know the core audience. I wish these movies the Ernest series would come back for the next generation so they can appreciate more familyfriendly should be! Grated fare.".

It's rare today to find even a Christmas movie that's not filled with bad language sexual innuendo and other filth but every Ernest movie is 100 clean familyfriendly fun. As an example I cite the character in this movie forget his or the actor's name it's been ages who used to host a children's show but got a part in a movie and couldn't bring himself to say a certain line with a bad word because he couldn't stand to think of the children hearing him say it. That wasn't just that character's attitude it was Jim Varney's as well. Varney was a chain smoker however he would never light up if there was a child around. And he refused to use foul language. I think Varney also made a nod to the state of movies with his Mr. Apopka the snake handler character in this movie That's all these Hollywood folk want. Poison! Speaking of characters Jim's various personifications always had me rolling on the floor. In this movie the best was definitely the old lady. Anyway I think any viewer with children who is looking for some clean funny movies for the kids would do well to rent this one or any of the Ernest movies.".

Santa Claus is getting older and is forgetting such important things like who's naughty and who's nice and who asked a toy truck etc. These of course are very important things for Santa to have stored in his memory. So in order to keep Christmas going at a rapid pace Santa sets his sights on Joe Carruthers a children's  to take over the very important job. Problem is that Joe is so busy with his acting career that each time Santa tries to tell him about the gig he either leaves in a rush thanks to his money hungry agent or doesn't believe that what Santa is saying is real. That's where Ernest and a runaway teenage girl named Harmony come into play. They go on a journey with Santa to make Joe the new Santa Claus thereby saving Christmas.I really enjoyed this Ernest film. It isn't as dumb and pointless as some of the other Ernest films done before and after it has a really nice message and is a heart warming Christmas movie. Jim Varney does his usual Ernest part to perfection and I really liked the dynamic between him Noelle Parker Harmony and Douglas Seale Santa Claus. You can see that they really believe in Santa eventually and come to care about him and saving Christmas. There are some laughs in this as well I always loved when Ernest would dress up as the old woman with the wig and neck brace. Pretty solid comedic moments in this one for sureI highly recommend anyone looking for a good Christmas movie to see 'Ernest Saves Christmas'. Douglas Seale may be the most realistic Santa Claus I've seen in more recent Christmas movies. He has a classic look to him in this film that I love it adds to the story wonderfully. It isn't the huge bellybright white beard look it's a more old styled Santa Claus character which was refreshing to see. Check it out!710".

	schema:reviewBody "How one responds to the character of Ernest P. Worrell and his feature film vehicles may depend on personal taste. If you enjoy the shtick of the late Jim Varney in this role you may very well enjoy the movie. It goes without saying that it's going to be awfully silly at times and it does get rather repetitive as it plays out but there's still a fair amount of charm and good intentions to the material. Ernest in this case is a good hearted cab driver who makes the acquaintance of Saint Nick wonderfully played by Douglas Seale. Saint Nick now realizes it's time for another person to take on the persona and perform the duties required and he believes that person is local children's show host Joe Carruthers Oliver Clark. Assorted wacky escapades including an out of control sleigh ride an airport hanger full of reindeer and Ernest donning various disguises and pulling various scams occur along the way. Varney is as enthusiastic and upbeat as ever and receives decent support from the other actors especially Seale and Clark. Robert Lesser is amusing as the stereotypically sleazy agent and the ever delightful Billie Bird can be seen in one of her sweet old lady roles she and her contemporary Frances Bay really cornered the market on this sort of thing. The screenplay also works into the story among more traditional Christmas themes the idea that people shouldn't be too quick to think cynically or too quick to judge someone and learn to trust them as well as the idea of regaining a degree of childhood innocence this is all applied to the little girl lost character of Harmony appealingly played by Noelle Parker. One of the nicest parts is when a businessmen from Canada! had declared to Santa that if anything he wanted to see snow for Christmas and gets his wish. Some of the comedy really is too much at times for example the reindeer scenes with some shameless goofy mugging not to mention eyeball gags from Gailard Sartain and Bill Byrge. The business with the horror film within the film may also be seen as questionable try explaining it to the younger kids even if it's deliberately designed as being very low rent and cheesy. It's interesting to see that the composer is the aptly named Mark Snow who went on to be the inhouse composer on 'The XFiles'. Overall a reasonably engaging bit of holiday fare even if just for nostalgic reasons for those who saw it at a younger age back in '88. Six out of 10.".

As Pauline is going to move to West Germany she wants to see her child once again for the last time but Anna John refuses.

	schema:reviewBody "Die Ratten or The Rats is a German blackandwhite sound film from over 60 years ago. The director is Robert Siodmak already and Oscar nominee at this point and back from Hollywood. Here he works with a couple big names from German cinema. The ones I heard of are Maria Schell Curd Jrgens and Ilse Steppat the latter two played villains in Bond films later in their careers. The writer is Jochen Huth and he adapted Gerhart Hauptmann's play for the screen here. As a result several of the actors were nominated for German Film Awards even some I did not mention before. But the 1950s probably weren't the best decade for German cinema. And this film's success here is another example. It is really not a great watch. Schell plays her part really well but I struggled with the script on several occasions. All the wishy washy and back and forth in terms of her wish to give up  keep her child made this one not too realistic and the mixup at the end almost has a comedic touch. So much chaos so much goes wrong in this film. I would have wished for more realism. Yes there are a couple good moments but those weren't frequent enough for a film over 90 minutes and I can see why this film is almost unknown today even here in Germany. It just isn't a great achievement and the big shock moment at the end really just makes my head shake. Looks like they wanted to go out the most memorable way but to me it was just a desperate attempt to distract from the mediocrity in the 1.5 hours before that. I do not recommend Die Ratten. Thumbs down.".

The trapeze sequences will leave you giddy. The montages of variety acts are witty and vibrant. Berlin nightlife in the '20s looks glamorous. And Jannings surely has one of the classic silentscreen actors' faces eloquently conveying a wide spectrum of emotions.Variete was a sensation when it appeared primarily for its camerawork. At the time director EA Dupont took most of the kudos and seemed launched on a promising career. But he was tapped out after his next flick the estimable Picadilly and in retrospect Freund is the creative force whose part in Variete assumes a place in a major body of film work.

This part of the story was excised completely by the American censors and title cards added to redefine Jannings and De Putti as the married couple of the U.S. release version. The censors' intent was to erase the plot point of casting adulterous lovers as the established couple in a love triangle. The effect was to far more radically transform the story. The unfaithful husband who is in his turn betrayed by his unfaithful lover is transformed into a sympathetic cuckold. The opportunistic temptress who catches two men only to end up with none is transformed into a young wife who succumbs to temptation.

	schema:reviewBody "The Plot Prologue The murderer Boss Huller  after having spent ten years in prison  breaks his silence to tell the warden his story. Boss a former trapeze artist and his wife own a cheap sideshow that displays ''erotic sensations''. But he longs for his former glamorous life in the circus. When he meets the orphan BertaMarie he falls under her spell and leaves his wife and young son behind. He makes BertaMarie his partner in a new trapeze number. One day the famous trapeze artist Artinelli takes note of them and engages them for his trapeze show in Berlin. Their salto mortale becomes an immediate sensation. Calculatedly and cold Artinelli seduces BertaMarie and destroys Boss' happiness.If you are watching a version shorter than 112 minutes you are watching the edited version. My screening was 83 minutes so I know there were lots of scenes cut out.Still it's an interesting movie. Yes the story line is dated but I assume that was not the case back in 1925.The direction is really good.I found interest in watching how people lived back then. Smoking all the time indoors the luggage used the different acts at the circus which BTW was not a circus as we know it today more a vaudeville show.All the guys wear suits and ties and hats. A different time and place.Anyway..it's true that the story is not complex. And it's also true that the female lead is not especially attractive. Nor is she slim. And Jannings is laughably overweight to be an acrobat.The guy who is is stunt double for the acrobat scenes is literally 80 pounds lighter!Despite all...watch it for the cinematography!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Variet' based on a 1923 novel by Felix Hollaender 'Der Eid des Stephan Huller' has a pretty basic plot of adultery and jealousy that has seen service several times over the years and is here embellished by being set amidst the exotic and dangerous world of trapeze artists. It's thus HOW the story is told rather that WHAT happens that gives 'Variet' its lustre. It's certainly  along with most actual German silents  not an expressionist film the backdrop is grubbily realistic in a way far more characteristic of the majority of German films of the twenties rather than expressionist and has been rendered superstylish by cameraman Karl Freund who shot this between 'Der letzte Mann' and 'Metropolis' and director E.A.Dupont through flamboyant staging and camerawork.Emil Jannings is relatively restrained too and wears far less makeup and facial hair than we are accustomed to while amply demonstrating that he can still suggest violent menace just by staring and pursing his lips. Lya De Putti as the saucy little minx with her floppy boyish hair and knowingly expressive face who Jannings left his wife for and who then falls for creepy Warwick Ward still remains deliciously plausible as the cause of the destructive passion we witness over 90 years later.BIG SPOILER COMING The film seems to have been building up to Jannings allowing Ward to 'accidentally' fall to his death during their trapeze act but he instead kills him afterwards in his hotel room and immediately hands himself over to the police without bothering to explain why he did it. I don't know how the original novel ended but would have found a more satisfactory conclusion being Jannings committing the perfect murder by making Ward's death appear accidental and resuming married life with Ms De Putti both their lives soured by the fact that she has lost her lover and is left unsure of whether his death really was an accident while Jannings' life is forever tarnished by the fact of his wife's betrayal. However this would have meant Jannings not going to jail and the German censor had probably found more than enough to take issue with without adding such an amoral resolution to this already salty brew of lust and immorality.".

	schema:headline " Wickedly Funny and ThoughtProvoking";
	schema:reviewBody "German playwright Bertolt Brecht felt that theatre should teach the audience certain moral lessons and to this end he developed a mode of presentation frequently described as theatre of alienationa type of production in which the audience is never allowed to fully identify with the characters and their situations and is instead asked to critically observe the material and draw conclusions from it. For the most part this is a style that works best on the stagebut director Michael Verhoeven uses it as a springboard for THE NASTY GIRL. And the result is one of the few instances in which these Brechtian concepts come successfully to the screen.The story is wickedly funny.

	onyx:emotionText "German playwright Bertolt Brecht felt that theatre should teach the audience certain moral lessons and to this end he developed a mode of presentation frequently described as theatre of alienationa type of production in which the audience is never allowed to fully identify with the characters and their situations and is instead asked to critically observe the material and draw conclusions from it. For the most part this is a style that works best on the stagebut director Michael Verhoeven uses it as a springboard for THE NASTY GIRL. And the result is one of the few instances in which these Brechtian concepts come successfully to the screen.The story is wickedly funny.

	schema:reviewBody "At points this film feels almost comic but never loses its focus on the important topic of Germans either coming to grips with the past or covering it up.  Some modernist filming techniques seem to remind the viewer that the film is very much set in the time of its production 1990 though the story begins in the 1970s rather than in the distant blackandwhite days of the past that is its most important subject.  It's like Verhoeven is saying the coverup is NOW.It is my understanding that the story is based on the experiences of an actual German woman.  That being the case Verhoeven could have written a serious biographical film about this woman's experiences as she struggled to investigate the truth of her town's activities during the Nazi regime. This was the method used in his portrayal of the Scholl siblings in Die Weisse Rose.  But I can see reasons for his different approach with this film. The topic of Die Weisse Rose is so heavy for obvious reasons and there is very little modern controversy over considering them heroes.  But as the topic of Das schreckliche Maedchen remains controversial and for many Germans difficult to discuss the somewhat lighthearted approach that Verhoeven takes may open doors for more viewers and more discussion.  And again I repeat that the approach does not diminish the topic's importance.  He strikes a nice balance.On another note this film is also a very good portrayal about a modern woman's struggle to be independent in her work while having a large family. I'm not surprised to see that the positive voting here at IMDB is most prevalent among women in their twenties and thirties.".

Apart from a very brief nude scene and some strong but appropriate in this situation language at the end this is an excellent movie for anyone about age 12 and up. It concerns a very nice young lady who is beloved by her small Bavarian townuntil she makes the mistake of looking into the town's dark past. It starts innocently enough as she is trying to write a paper about the town's heroes who resisted the Nazis. However no one in town seems willing to talk about this glorious resistance and the town's archives are closed to her. Only after making herself a pain in the butt by suing the town repeatedly does she get ahold of records that prove little if any resistance to the Nazis. In fact many of the most beloved townsmen in fact HELPED and actively supported the Nazis.The movie has a very odd artistic style. While it doesn't really detract from the film you should see it to understand what I am talking aboutit's quite unusual at times.What is so interesting and incredible about the movie was how everyone turned against her so quickly and violently. My only complaint was that it only talked about German reactions to their past. On a trip to Salzburg Austria just a few years back I noticed a beautiful monument to the Waffen SS the group that manned the death squads and enacted the final solution prominently displayed in the town's cemetery! Yes this was the SAME cemetery in which the Von Trapp family hid in the movie The Sound of Music! If you are there some day see it for yourself. It would be nice if someone confronted the apparently more open acceptance of their Nazi past here as well.".

	schema:headline " Verhoeven's Stage";
	schema:reviewBody "Using Brecht's idea of Epic Theatre Michael Verhoeven creates a stage upon which audiences can learn from the past and critique such instances from World War Two and Nazi Germany through the main character Sonja's struggles.Brecht wanted Epic Theatre to use history and let audiences apply it to the present. This type of theatre makes you aware that you are watching something staged so that you analyze the situation rather then feeling the same emotions of the characters. Verhoeven does this very nicely using a few alienation effects also know as vefremdungs effekt. One scene taking the walls down of Sonja's living room and having it float through town while people anonymously call and threaten her family. Here the idea of Foucault's panoptican an instrument that can see everything comes into play as well. Sonya has no anonymity from the public which is made up of the church the government the media and the fifth establishment the elder generation that serve as a link from the past to the present yet she cannot identify any of them specifically. Later on again in a different sequence Verhoeven brings back the walls. It is here that Sonja learns some names she can use to defend herself and the walls of defense are back. Bringing back the walls also helps alarm the audience just in case they were becoming too comfortable without them.Another part of the film is Sonja's family. In many scenes the children are seen crying and the father Martin tending to them and getting rather flustered. At one point he yells at Sonja telling her how her children would like their mother. Later on at the end of the film we learn that he has left her. Verhoeven plays on Sonja's obsession for finding the truth as a distraction from her family yet there are parts where she still says she needs to stop for the safety of her family because of threats. I think the scenes of neglecting the family are overdone to not show the point that Sonja is a bad mother but that she wants her children to grow up and learn to love their Heimat homeland which during WWII was given a negative political term. She wants to make things better for her children so they don't grow up learning all of the corrupt things the her town has been covering up.The Nasty Girl is a clever and great cinematic film that makes you think rather then feel. As the viewer you walk away learning something.".

	schema:headline " Consensus Blindness Brilliantly and Vividly Portrayed";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a magnificent film by Michael Verhoeven. I saw it when it came out years ago and have just seen it again. It certainly holds up and if anything is more powerful now. The film contains one of the most astonishing performances by an actress I have ever seen. Lena Stolze plays the character Sonja from the age of 16 through to adulthood. How did she do it? She was already far from her teens when she played the cutest 16 yearold with pigtails and the innocent eyes of a child. Her whimsy and her manner made her perfect for this difficult part and her success made the film work. The film itself was done in an equally whimsical manner not troubling in many cases to use real sets or locations but with a remarkable lightness of touch and confidence of technique in many cases settling for setups of a theatrical nature and the film is interspersed with pieces to camera by numerous characters. It sounds a mess but it isn't and it all holds together and works perfectly. Apart from the control kept over it by the director this technique is successful because it accentuates the irony of the subject. And that subject is so troubling to all potential viewers going as it does far beyond blindness to past Nazi activities that if it were laid on heavy it would not be accepted because it would be perceived as an attack on everybody. But it is actually an attack on everybody because the film seeks to expose a faultline in human nature of our tendency to conspire to forget conspire not to see and conspire to falsify reality. This hairline crack in human nature is a tendency to form what I call 'consensus reality' which is generally a shared fantasy in which we all agree to believe because it makes us feel better. The character Sonja in this film based upon a real girl named Anja who actually had similar experiences challenges consensus reality. And of course she was attacked by absolutely everyone her husband abandoned her she was beaten bombed ostracised and persecuted mercilessly for years. Her only 'crime' was to try to discover the story of her home town in Bavaria during the Nazi period. The fact is that just about everybody living in Germany during that period was seriously compromised there were few heroes despite the many claims of heroism which came after the War and the majority of Germans actually approved of and supported the Nazis. One should never forget that Hitler was ELECTED. One can perhaps explain phenomena like the rise of Nazism by temporary insanity of a nation but the nasty and despicable aftermath cannot be so explained. It is pure animal behaviour of the most revolting kind. The postWar behaviour of the Germans was in this sense even more offensive than their wartime behaviour. But they are not alone nor are they worst in this tendency. After all the Japanese still refuse to apologise for the War and make offerings at shrines to 'war heroes' who were guilty of war crimes. Compared to that the Germans are pussycats they apologised long ago and the younger generations have long since atoned and 'reformed'. If anyone tried even now to make a film like this about Japan they would probably be killed by a raging mob. So put that in your meerschaum pipe and smoke it.".

The film itself was done in an equally whimsical manner not troubling in many cases to use real sets or locations but with a remarkable lightness of touch and confidence of technique in many cases settling for setups of a theatrical nature and the film is interspersed with pieces to camera by numerous characters. It sounds a mess but it isn't and it all holds together and works perfectly. Apart from the control kept over it by the director this technique is successful because it accentuates the irony of the subject. And that subject is so troubling to all potential viewers going as it does far beyond blindness to past Nazi activities that if it were laid on heavy it would not be accepted because it would be perceived as an attack on everybody. But it is actually an attack on everybody because the film seeks to expose a faultline in human nature of our tendency to conspire to forget conspire not to see and conspire to falsify reality. This hairline crack in human nature is a tendency to form what I call 'consensus reality' which is generally a shared fantasy in which we all agree to believe because it makes us feel better. The character Sonja in this film based upon a real girl named Anja who actually had similar experiences challenges consensus reality. And of course she was attacked by absolutely everyone her husband abandoned her she was beaten bombed ostracised and persecuted mercilessly for years. Her only 'crime' was to try to discover the story of her home town in Bavaria during the Nazi period. The fact is that just about everybody living in Germany during that period was seriously compromised there were few heroes despite the many claims of heroism which came after the War and the majority of Germans actually approved of and supported the Nazis. One should never forget that Hitler was ELECTED. One can perhaps explain phenomena like the rise of Nazism by temporary insanity of a nation but the nasty and despicable aftermath cannot be so explained. It is pure animal behaviour of the most revolting kind. The postWar behaviour of the Germans was in this sense even more offensive than their wartime behaviour. But they are not alone nor are they worst in this tendency. After all the Japanese still refuse to apologise for the War and make offerings at shrines to 'war heroes' who were guilty of war crimes. Compared to that the Germans are pussycats they apologised long ago and the younger generations have long since atoned and 'reformed'. If anyone tried even now to make a film like this about Japan they would probably be killed by a raging mob. So put that in your meerschaum pipe and smoke it.";

Lena Stolze's the 'nasty girl' speech directly to the audience is part of it as well as the effect of an obvious rear projection of the municipal archive while we see the actors performing on stage around a desk. Furthermore Verhoeven's consistency in sharpening the criticism on the German bourgeoisie is remarkable at the time of the nation's reunion when skeptical and 'unpatriotic' words weren't particularly popular. The overall effect of it is not the exposure of a concealed guilt but the presentation of a disconcerting as well as funny permanent embarrassment because we witness both the knowledge and the laborious acts of ignorance. The mulishness of the girl might be a little infantile because she hasn't put up with reality yet  and probably never will. But really childish and stubborn and therefore dangerous are all those authorities who try to block her search for truth all the time.

I found it interesting that they choose to start the movie with her mother being asked to leave her job as a teacher for being pregnant. She was married and I don't feel like the children she taught were of an age where that wasn't acceptable. I think Michael Verhoeven was trying to foreshadow that she was going to be a trouble maker but I still didn't think it was necessary for her mother to loose her job. I did like the scene where she throws the fish they were having for lunch back into the water. There is nothing nasty about Sonja's character. Due to the misleading translation of the title the film is often put in the adult section of the video store when there is nothing pornographic about the film's content. The film really should be put in the drama or history sections of a video store.Overall I thought the film was good. I didn't agree with some of the transitions like how all of a sudden Wegmus goes from her teacher to her boyfriend over the course of a car ride to school there should have been more there especially because she is barely a teenager when they first kiss and he is about to graduate from college. But I did like the photography and the overall theme of the movie. I think Sonja's character showed that you can do anything you put your mind to. She was determined to find answers and she didn't let anything stop her. She wants to make things better for her children so they don't grow up learning all of the corrupt things the her town has been covering up. Overall the production direction and acting were very well done. I would definitely recommend the film but please realize you are watching German cinema which is usually a little strange when you are used to American style movies.".

It was that it had been Oscar nominated and the title and cover suggested something juicy and punky that the Nasty Girl was indeed far from being a Saint.But she is of sorts. This my second viewing allowed me to see deeper into the film's structure and message. Lena Stolze as Sonja the girl then a woman who starts out thinking up a subject for her school essay assignment. Teachers always like to patronise their pupils when they show enthusiasm and initiative and so her project is blessed and praised. At first.As her task becomes a fulltime passion and as she uncovers possible cover ups as to who in the town were Nazis and how far their crimes went those doors to her previously so open are now closed. Director Michael Verhoeven whose name sounds Dutch but he was born in Berlin employs a necessary offbeat and humorous approach sometimes stylised sets with backprojected interiors pasted on. There's an air of flippancy throughout and the briskness of the narrative means that we don't ponder too much on a single point before moving on.The slamming doors become sticks of dynamite and deaththreats which we cannot take that seriously due to semicomic take on it all. Court cases come up are won lost and won again. Inhabitant's opinions change after an accident involving the judge picking pears causes the final case to collapse.You like me may find that there are unanswered questions and ultimately whilst the journey was fun for most of its time what really was the point? What did she prove apart from the fact that she was able to change opinion.Anyway a nice little film not too long and a bit different and also really quite German.".

Lead actress gives a very fine performance as a woman who grows up in a nice funny town full of basically good people who lived under the Nazis during Hitler's rule. As she grows and studies the world around her she discovers hints of past and present that were not obvious at first. Let us just say that life under the Nazis absolutely required compromise that could amount to dreadful criminal activity by any civilized standard and old influences die hard. This woman becomes the catalyst of social change and historic preservation driving herself to the brink of madness and risking her life in the process. This movie is great fun anyway. The fun humor and joy of life never quite go away even when events turn dramatic and dangerous. I just can't say enough about the artistry and skill that went into this movie. If you see it and you grew up in a town populated by fallible human beings you may feel charged up by the breathtaking emotional ride toward a better world.".

Imamura's trademark of showing people as they are rather than what we would like them to be is on vivid display here  as with THE EEL and WARM WATER UNDER A RED BRIDGE the quirks and eccentricities of the characters in this case a crusading doctor battling a hepatitis outbreak that may be a mere reflection of an obsessive mind a morphineaddicted surgeon a former prostitute and a lecherous alcoholic monk aren't just allowed but are viewed as essential components of identity and the depiction of such eccentricities is the only way to capture a true community in all of its' ragged glory. Inherent in this kind of depiction is an unshakeable confidence that even the most deeply flawed human beings have or are capable of acting on principle and conviction if sufficiently moved to do so. Thus the story swings from poetic to tragic to hilarious to disturbing at the drop of a hat and Imamura's confident mastery in managing all of this perhaps rivaling even Fellini makes him one of the greats. It should also be noted that  though his style and worldview are both extremely different  Imamura like his onetime mentor Yasujiro Ozu makes films that look like no one else's with an unhurried careful eye that somehow manages to make even the debris of the stories he relates take on a quality of human necessity.

Dr. Akagi explores many of the same themes from the angle of a more dignified and admirable protagonist a widower physician in a small fishing village whose life work is to tend to the many locals who are falling ill with hepatitis a disease whose pathology and means of transmission are not yet understood. It also presents an interesting view of wartime Japan in a village removed from the immediate devastation of the war how life goes on as it typically does but with the war slowly intruding more and more into the people's daily lives until it literally explodes above their heads. The director's great talent in my opinion is how he never judges his subjects whether because the person is a whore a morphine addict an embezzler a dissolute drunkard or pervert. He depicts them as they are. The characters and situations depicted in this movie seem to me very authentic representations of the Japanese character in its multiplicity and that's part of what makes it a delight to watch. Dr. Akagi is the most intriguing one of all the characters as he goes through not one but two personal transformations in the movie that are so subtle at first that you fail to notice them until the movie comes together neatly at the end yet leaves the question what motivates us to do the things that we do in life what's our purpose in life and what keeps us alive. Of course the answer is never clear and the movie does not shy from that reality. The cinematography is also very nice especially the scenes with the whale at the end which are simply beautiful and imbued with mythos in a scene in which director wonderfully transforms the village whore and daughter of a fisherman into the mythical woman that reawakens Dr. Akagi to his life. Beautifully done. Only complaint the jazz soundtrack is a bit overly intrusive and excessive. That should have been toned down a bit but otherwise a very moving and poignant film.".

This particular entry into the Imamura canon deals with a Kyushu doctor during WWII.  Of course the film goes way beyond just that it's a film that cannot be summed up in words it's the kind of movie that you sit back and enjoy and you come out of smiling for you've been entertained in a way most films cannot.  Kanzo Sensei affects like a truly satisfying book does something most films cannot come close to copying. If you dig it rent the eel and look out for his next work coming soon to a theatre far from you and meJapan.

So he and his bunch take Wickie along on their voyages to give him the experience he'll need to be an actual Viking. He usually accompanies his dad and his warriors on their adventures and often is the young who uses his wit and instincts to help the friends in their times of need .Yet somehow tribe's children end up trapped or hopelessly stuck somewhere and kidnapped by the nasty Sven Gunther Kauffmann and it's up to Wickie alone to help them out with his flashes of wit . Our friends Halvar  Snorre Christian Koch  Tjore  Urobe go out to rescue them on their ships  the Viking Drakkar and Vickie aboard as stowaway.This agreeable film contains amusing adventures  humor  emotion and is pretty entertaining . Not only did the story convey us to great and funny adventures it also showed how to solve problems without the use of force. A likable Vickie  he is an ordinary viking boy he is also not very strong but with his flashes of intelligence saves the day  helping the crew to resolve the numerous problems they suffer . The motion picture is well and originally directed by Michael Bully Herbig . He is an expert on parody based on known characters such as Karl May's Winnitou in the film titled manitou's shoes 2001 the second feature movie he directed  became the most successful movie in Germany and Austria ever and Sissi in Lissi and the Wild Emperor and of course Vickie in this enjoyable film  Vickie the Viking  .

Thus I went into the movie without any expectations and ended up being pleasantly surprised.The story is neither overly inventive nor epic but there's always enough happening to keep the viewer interested.The movie had plenty of fun moments I couldn't help noticing that it's mostly targeted at the younger generation but there are also a few mature references. Altogether anyone who has a good relationship with their inner child should have a few good laughs throughout the playtime.The cast is mostly unknown at least to me since I don't watch that many German productions but excellent. Almost every character has a striking resemblance to his or her cartoon counterpart and the acting is decent.Yet again I have to bow in front of Bully Herbig when it comes to production value. The movie looks and sounds fantastic if it had been a highbudget Hollywood production there probably wouldn't have been too much of a difference to the product at hand Apart from the addition of some overdone special FX. The music composer Ralf Wengenmayr did an excellent job of working the original melodies into the score as well as adding some new ones which really matched the movie's mood.Most people Wickie fan or not should enjoy it.".

But the cast is excellent especially Guenther Kaufmann as a deliciously evil and over the top Sven and the production is beautiful. Perhaps the highest praise a film can earn my daughter forced my fatherinlaw who speaks no German whatsoever and is impatient with things that he doesn't like at the best of times to watch Wickie. Not only did he not complain but when we were all called to dinner he wanted to stay to watch the rest of the film. High praise indeed! I have heard rumors that they're filming a sequel. We sure hope so. My daughter is eager to follow more of Wickie's adventures.".

Not only did he not complain but when we were all called to dinner he wanted to stay to watch the rest of the film. High praise indeed! I have heard rumors that they're filming a sequel. We sure hope so. My daughter is eager to follow more of Wickie's adventures.";

They claim that magic exists and that if you know how to use it you can actually work miracles. Young Wickie's only power is his alleged cleverness. But his solutions just ignore the laws of physics and logic. And that's not clever at all.At one point the ship of Wickie's Vikings has to catch up with another one that's quite ahead of them. A map illustrates the situation Wickie's ship is on the right side of an island both ships are heading for a place on the left side. Wickie sees that the route across the island is only a third of the route around it and gets the genius idea to just cross it  with their ship. Harry Potter would have figured something out and wiggled his wand but Wickie's men really have to pull the big viking ship for miles and miles over land. Later on he uses some minuscule kites flying next to the majestic big sail of their ship to get it up into the air. Cleverness never looked that stupid.The whole point of the Wickie character is that he's a small and weak Viking boy who is still of great value to his community because his ideas are based on the general knowledge of our times and therefore are way ahead of his. In this movie he's got only wacky ideas that even an eight year old should recognize as humbug. Still his inanities gain him the admiration of the elders.All grownup vikings are depicted as idiots all kinds of idiots the vain idiot the bragging idiot the cowardly idiot the No I'm not stolen from the Asterix comicstroubadour idiot. The kids and the women are basically alright but the men are all halfwits. Would you really consider to expose your children to such hateful nonsense? A good comedy will lift you up this annoying movie is set to dumb people down. If you are intellectually insecure enough to need to laugh about stupid people you will like this movie because it doesn't feature anything else but please don't expose innocent children to this junk.I didn't read the Wickie books from the 60ies or watched the 70ies TVshow but it would really surprise me if they'd be even slightly as heart and witless as this Michael 'Bully' Herbig movie. Yes that's the director's official nickname. Right in the beginning Wickie is forced by a big strong grownup bully to engage himself in a duel of physical strengths designed to humiliate him in front of the whole village. Evil. Who's that bully? Wickie's father. Now that's really evil! This is definitely not a family movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember very well when there was a casting show for the child actor to play Wickie which ran several weeks and was put into effect by Michael Herbig one of Germany's most famous comedians Bullyparade and also the writer and director of this movie. He also plays a small role as a Spanish narrator which really should have been left out. It's neither funny nor does it add a lot to the film. This can be said about most of the movie. There are many much better children's book adaptations out there and the only scene I kinda liked was the battle between Wickie and his dad with the stone carrying sequence early on.The dad reminded me a bit of Majestix from the Asterix movies especially when looking at how he communicates with his wife. Wickie however is not a rough brutal viking as they want him to be. He works much more with his mind than with his nonexisting biceps. The plot is that all the viking children are abducted by another viking tribe it is not shown how that happens probably as it's a kids film and they may have gotten scared and so Wickie who managed to flee and his clan need to get them back. There are actually some interesting names cast as villains. if you are slightly familiar with German cinema you may recognize the late Gnther Kaufmann worked a lot with Fassbinder Christoph Maria Herbst Herbert Feuerstein or Jrgen Vogel. Herbig has worked a lot with Herbst in the past but his Bullyparade colleagues Tramitz and Kavanian are not around this time.All in all this movie is a fairly weak comic book adaptation. The sequel which came out not much later is slightly better thanks to the introduction of an interesting new character but not by much. With all these great children's books' adaptations out there currently I cannot recommend to watch this one. There's many better choices and I am somehow surprised to see this was the most successful German movie at the box office from 2009 back in the year of Avatar. The humor was just really weak here. One example was the underwater sequence which did almost nothing for me comedywise. Apart from that I assume the dramatic highlight should be the fathersonrelationship but on an emotional level it did not strike me either even if the song about that issue was nice but also much more comedylike than dramatic. What was truly bad was the version of the Hey Wickie theme song they included here. All in all not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Originally showcased at the 1980 Berlin Film Festival this was initially criticised for being far too long  that being 151 minutes. So it was edited down to just two hours and has become seen as a German classic in the intervening years. It tells the story of Hans and Lene who meet before the outbreak of World War II and fall in love  both are not pro Hitler and so are not Party members. It opens with the poem of the title 'Germany Pale Mother' by Berthold Brecht and it is read by his daughter. It was penned in 1933 but to hear it today it would be easy to mistake it being about Hitler and the War.When Germany invades Poland Hans is called up and so begins the long years of separation. In the meantime they have a daughter  Anna  who is the narrator of the film and tells their story through her eyes and the experiences of a child. The war is cruel and then when it is over the cruelties seem to get worse. This film spans many years and the heartbreaks and travails of just existing  let alone surviving.This is not a war film  it uses archive footage which looks very aged indeed interspersed with the later material to try to place the story better in the historical context. The acting is all superb but the story is depressing. It is meant to be depressing I think to ram home the cost of war and what it does to the body mind and even the soul. There are some very hard to watch scenes here and at the full length this does need some commitment. There is a line that is possibly meant more as a plea than a statement and that is when Anna says 'who am I to judge I was just lucky enough to be born later'. German speakers will not be impressed by the sub titles though  pretty average as far as they go. This though is a great film it is one that the BFI have helped restore and it is a difficult watch but it is also a film that needs to be seen if only for its message and it needs to be preserved in the hope that such folly will never be repeated.".

	schema:headline " The horrors don't stop when the war does";
	schema:reviewBody "Germany Pale Mother is a unrelentingly bleak film made all the more so by the fact that it is a semiautobiographical portrait of Helma SandersBrahms parents. The film covers about a decade or so in their lives from newlyweds in Hitler's Germany to the reconstruction post German era. We first hear of Lene before we see her. Hans and his friend Ulrich spot her walking along the bank as they are boating along a river. Despite the fact that Hans finds her attractive he watches impassively as a dog belonging to some Nazi party members attack her but is most impressed by the fact that she doesn't scream or flinch. They later attend a dance together and Lene asks him if he's a member of the Nazi party something that's important to her though she seems fairly apolitical and doesn't have strong feelings about the Nazis even when she watches them haul off one of her Jewish neighbours. Lene and Hans marry and are quite happy together but the happiness is short lived. Since he's a low level civil servant who isn't even a member of the party he is quickly conscripted into the army to go fight in Poland the first in several professional setbacks he will face as a result of not joining the Nazis. Things are great for Lene either. Though the early years of the war mostly involve waiting around for her husband to come home from leave and ignoring the fact that more and more Jewish families are being hauled off the evil of the war will come and visit her much later. I've often heard it said that in the most personal stories we find universal truths and this certainly is true in this film. SandersBrahms settles her point of view almost exclusively on her mother and her parents' marriage and yet it manages to cover so much from the way in which Germans even nonNazis ended up participating in the war through their willingness to look the other way to the way in which Nazi corruption continued after the war. By focusing on her mother SandersBrahms also turns some conventional wisdoms on their head. While the men were off fighting abroad Lene has a difficult life but she manages to get along become independent taking care of herself and her child. Some of the worst things that happen to her happen during peace and reconstruction times when the men who are supposed to protect her betray her in horrible ways. Eva Mattes as Lene has by far the showiest role and she is pretty fantastic in it. The real star though is SandersBrahms direction. There are so many bold choices from using herself as a voiceover splicing in documentary footage of a little boy being interviewed so that it looks as if he is having a conversation with Lene a shot of the swastika reflected in a pool of water which are haunting and poignant.".

	onyx:emotionText "Germany Pale Mother is a unrelentingly bleak film made all the more so by the fact that it is a semiautobiographical portrait of Helma SandersBrahms parents. The film covers about a decade or so in their lives from newlyweds in Hitler's Germany to the reconstruction post German era. We first hear of Lene before we see her. Hans and his friend Ulrich spot her walking along the bank as they are boating along a river. Despite the fact that Hans finds her attractive he watches impassively as a dog belonging to some Nazi party members attack her but is most impressed by the fact that she doesn't scream or flinch. They later attend a dance together and Lene asks him if he's a member of the Nazi party something that's important to her though she seems fairly apolitical and doesn't have strong feelings about the Nazis even when she watches them haul off one of her Jewish neighbours. Lene and Hans marry and are quite happy together but the happiness is short lived. Since he's a low level civil servant who isn't even a member of the party he is quickly conscripted into the army to go fight in Poland the first in several professional setbacks he will face as a result of not joining the Nazis. Things are great for Lene either. Though the early years of the war mostly involve waiting around for her husband to come home from leave and ignoring the fact that more and more Jewish families are being hauled off the evil of the war will come and visit her much later. I've often heard it said that in the most personal stories we find universal truths and this certainly is true in this film. SandersBrahms settles her point of view almost exclusively on her mother and her parents' marriage and yet it manages to cover so much from the way in which Germans even nonNazis ended up participating in the war through their willingness to look the other way to the way in which Nazi corruption continued after the war.

	schema:headline " An important topic lost in execution";
	schema:reviewBody "Deutschland bleiche Mutter or Germany Pale Mother is a West German 2hour movie from 1980 so this one already had its 35th anniversary last year. The writer and director is Helma SandersBrahms a filmmaker who died 2 years ago and was probably among Germany's most impactful female directors of the 20th century. This one here is her most known work I guess. But sadly I cannot share the praise. The question if and how much you end up liking this film is closely connected with how much you like lead actress Eva Mattes in here as she is in basically every scene from start to finish. I have liked her much more in some other films I saw and she feels sometimes pretty much off the mark and overthetop in here. This is especially disappointing as the topic deserves a much better film. I also cannot say that I was too fond of the script in general or the male lead actor Ernst Jacobi in here. Mattes plays a woman who lives on her own in Nazi Germany after her husband goes off to war and also after the war has ended she is still alone for quite a while until her man finally returns home from imprisonment. In the meantime she is mother of a daughter and a lot more has changed also her man's state of mind and last but not least her own sanity. At times it is a pretty tough watch and there is no other appropriate description for this film in terms of genre other than drama. It is not a failure by any means but I also did not think it was a worthy addition to the best watches in terms of Trmmerfrauen films. But then again it seems as if the focus is much more on the two protagonists than on the historic context and this was a negative aspect as well in my opinion. All in all the bad outweighs the good and this film dragged considerably during its 120 minutes runtime. I give it a thumbsdown.".

Maxwell Scott The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance In John Ford's most mournful tale the legendary director asks the question How did this present come to be? Just how did an inferior race of men whose only weapon was that of law and books defeat the old gunslingers of the great West? Just what exactly happened to the Western heroes portrayed by John Wayne when law and order came to town? How did the wilderness turn into a garden? In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance John Ford depicts a world where everyone has got everything they wanted but nobody seems happy with it sound familiar to anyone? Senator Ransom Stoddard James Stewart arrives to Shinbone on a train with his wife Hallie Vera Miles to visit the funeral of an old friend named Tom Doniphon John Wayne remarkably the film opens where this iconic star is dead. The newspaper men have never heard of him so why would such a powerful political figure visit the town to attend this funeral of a nobody? Through the use of a flashback Stoddard tells us the tale of how he came to the town as a young lawyer but was immediately attacked by the psychotic villain Liberty Valance terrifyingly played by Lee Marvin who teaches him Western law. The rest of the film tells the tale of how the man of books eventually defeated the race of the gunslinger and what sacrifices had to be made for that to happen.In truth The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is more of a melodrama than a Western. Gone are the vibrant landscapes of Ford's landmark movie The Searchers six years earlier which was so proudly promoted as being in VISTAVISION WIDESCREEN COLOR and instead the film has given way to a bleak claustrophobic black and white tale with so many enclosed sets and not one shot of Monument Valley.There's a lack of a real bar scene lack of shots of the landscape lack of horses lack of gunfights. It's a psychological Western probably unlike anything ever filmed until maybe Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.Why is this movie so good then? In basic terms it's about the sadness of progression and without giving way too much away the film tells a remarkable tale which truly does examine what Ford's view of the West as promoted in his earlier work truly meant. It's a tragic and pessimistic movie but it's a rewarding one with huge replay value and one that leaves you with so many more questions than it does answers.Do we prefer the legendary tale of our heroes or the truth? Are tales of people such as 'The Man With No Name' just more interesting than Wyatt Earp? Is living a lie as a successful guy better or worse than quietly dying as a hero? The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of the most complex Westerns that has ever been put on film and is a remarkable film when you consider it was directed by a guy who made his living telling grandeur tales of the American West. Well acted very well written and is one of the most rewarding Westerns for replay value in the history of the genre.Matt Holmes www.obsessedwithfilm.com".

Wayne at heart is as contemptuous of what Stewart stands fortalk and conferences and thick legal tomes as the gunman is And through him you feel Ford saying that the hard men who had it the hardest on the frontier are soon forgotten and some of the frontier's simple virtues have been buried with themThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is honest unpretentious and deeply moving... In no other Ford Western does the audience feel so involved... The playing is brilliantfrom the smallest role to the beautifully interpreted ambivalent relationship of Wayne and Stewart...Their acting style are quite different... Stewart had developed a standard repertoire of mannerisms that his public had come to cherish... Wayne's style was spare clean and unadorned he stood tall very much himself... Certainly this film exemplifies a wonderful blending of three great talents Ford's Stewart's and Wayne's and their seamless mutual chemistry is one of the salient aspect of it...".

In no other Ford Western does the audience feel so involved... The playing is brilliantfrom the smallest role to the beautifully interpreted ambivalent relationship of Wayne and Stewart...Their acting style are quite different... Stewart had developed a standard repertoire of mannerisms that his public had come to cherish... Wayne's style was spare clean and unadorned he stood tall very much himself... Certainly this film exemplifies a wonderful blending of three great talents Ford's Stewart's and Wayne's and their seamless mutual chemistry is one of the salient aspect of it...";

	schema:headline " Ford's chamber Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Some films are slow to give up their secrets first time round and need some time to elapse before they are revalued.  An opportunity to see The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance after a gap of several years turned out to be an unexpectedly rewarding experience.  It had never been one of my favourite Ford films indeed I was always puzzled why many rate it so highly in the canon.  Its rather plain blackandwhite visuals smack of low production values and it has little of the grand operatic sweep of many of his other Westerns.  I can now see that I was rather missing the point Liberty Valance is that rare thing a chamber Western a quiet and elegiac reappraisal of the legends of the West made almost at the end of Ford's creative career with Cheyenne Autumn the only Western still to come.  A U.S. senator played by James Stewart returns with his wife Vera Miles at her most attractive to the small Western town where as a young man he tied to set up a law business to attend the funeral of the man John Wayne who saved his life when he tried to rid the community of its villain Liberty Valance Lee Marvin.  Ford's Westerns had always been the stuff of legend.  Now towards the end of his career he began to take the legend apart.  The hero is not the one who goes on to become one of the town's most illustrious sons but the quiet man who fades into the background.  It needs more than idealism to overcome evil the film seems to be saying  Brute force has to be countered by brute force moreover true worth is not always rewarded or recognised by society.  It is a bleak message that Ford is giving us.  By homing in on character and plot to a far greater extent than usual he gives us an experience that is often more akin to filmed theatre than cinema.  There are unusually long sequences in studio built interiors the diner the bar and a theatre where an election adoption meeting is taking place.  Outdoor sequences are few and far between.  Instead of a large collective enemy such as marauding Indian tribes there is just the one baddy and his pair of sycophants.  The pivotal action scene where Liberty Valance receives his just deserts takes place in a dark street and has none of the climactic sense of drama to be found in such shootouts as My Darling Clementine of Zinnemann's High Noon.  I can at last see that those very limitations that for so so long prevented me from appreciating Liberty Valance give it a sense of concentration and strength that the Western rarely achieves.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful and nostalgic western with two great heroes";
	schema:reviewBody "Westerns aren't normally my favourite so it has to be a good one and this one starring two legends James Stewart  John Wayne is surely one of the best. It ranks with me right behind High Noon.It tells the tale of an aging Washington Senator Ranse Stoddard who returns to Shinbone his sometime hometown in the West with his wife Hallie for the funeral of their friend Tom Doniphon. While there he relates his story to a journalist telling how he came to Shinbone as a young lawyer and met there both Tom  Hallie who was formerly Tom's sweetheart. He became famous as the man who shot the notorious bandit Liberty Valence which kick started his political career. However Stoddard realizes that this career is based on a lie and he experiences his own guilt dealing with it. The shot that actually killed Valence came from another gun not his own. The film emphatically makes the point that perception or rumour reported as truth and reality are not necessarily one and the same thing. The public has lauded Stoddard all these years for a heroic deed he didn't really do.The movie has marvelous characters and a stellar cast portraying them. Both Ranse Stoddard and Tom Doniphon though seemingly opposite come across as sympathetic honourable men with great personal integrity. This is a film with TWO heroes protagonist  antagonist to one another... though jointly opposing the villainous Valence. The legendary James Stewart such a decent man himself is perfect in the role of the noble lawyer  Senator Ranse Stoddard who is initially opposed to gun violence advocating education and the rule of law. He is not too proud to don an apron and wash dishes to pay for his keep. That great Western hero John Wayne is forceful as always portraying the rough hewn Tom Doniphon. His philosophy is 'the gun is the law' and he has little respect for either book learning or law courts.Lee Marvin is downright deliciously sullen  evil as the whip wielding Liberty Valence. I love that restaurant steak scene he's just so despicable the way he holds the terrified citizenry in his grip! Few villains elicit more outrage than his heinous acts against Dutton Peabody the drunken editor of the Shinbone Star. Liberty Valence...what an absolutely fabulous name for this wretched snake! Can you imagine any other name in the movie title?This film seems to take a nostalgic look at the decline of the Old West and its replacement with modern civilization. Tom Doniphon of course represents the rugged frontier West. He is actually dead throughout this movie his character revealed only through the flashback retelling of the story. By contrast Ranse Stoddard brings from the East law and literacy to this Western town. From the time he first comes to Shinbone as a young lawyer he teaches its inhabitants to read  write. The conflict between the old frontier ways and the new educated society based on law  order is clearly revealed in the love triangle here. Both Tom Doniphon and Ranse Stoddard court the lovely and quietly spirited Hallie played by Vera Miles. The cactus rose symbolizes her early attraction to Tom and the Old West the real rose her newfound romance with Ranse and his Eastern sophistication. Her courtship by Tom is eventually replaced by her marriage to Ranse causing Tom's increased drinking and gradual decline. Other characters include the drunken Doc Willoughby and the cowardly Marshall Link Appleyard who shrinks away from dealing with Valence. The movie is a compelling metaphor for the decline of the Old West has a gripping plot and surely some of the best character depictions ever. All told it's a wonderful movie for both fans of westerns and for those who are normally not.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Ford was the first to see the potential in John Wayne and helped  shape his image in a series of a classic westerns including  Stagecoach Fort Apache She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and The Searchers.  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is the most subtle treatment of  Wayne's character and represents one of his most fully realized roles  approaching the tragic in its depth. The film deals with the passing of  the American West's values of freedom and independence. In many ways it  is a summation and reexamination of the whole notion of the West as  promulgated by Wayne and Ford.  The story begins at the turn of the 19th century. Senator Ransom  Stoddard Jimmy Stewart is traveling by train to Shinbone the town  of his youth for the funeral of Tom Doniphon John Wayne. Stoddard is  a senior senator with presidential aspirations. Doniphon is an unknown.  Stoddard and his wife Hallie Vera Miles go to the undertaker and  stand before the plain box that holds Doniphon.  Enter the local press. They must know why the Senator has gone out his  way to attend the funeral of an unknown cowhand. There is an old  stagecoach on blocks at the undertaker'sa reference to the stagecoach  that marked Wayne's breakthrough role. Stewart hems and haws dusts off  the old stage. It looks like the one that brought him to Shinbone  decades before. And so the retelling begins.  It is the 1870's. Stoddard is a young lawyer journeying by stage to  make his fortune out west. Bandits waylay the stage and Stoddard is  beaten by the eponymous Liberty Valance Lee Marvin. Stoddard is the  symbol of eastern civilization impotent in the face of Valance's  lawlessness. In the next scene we see Doniphon entering Shinbone with  the beaten Stoddard thrown into the back of his buckboard. Between the  impotent Stoddard and the lawless Valance is the figure of Doniphon  the only man whom Valance fears and pillar of the town friend to the  newspaper editor beau to Hallie and foil to the inept marshal Andy  Devine. Shinbone is a dysfunctional town. Legal authority as embodied  by Devine is cowardly gluttonous and corrupt. Stoddard the man with  the intellectual ability to bring law to the town is devoid of  authority. Doniphon the man who has the physical power and respect of  the town to give force to the law and bring order to Shinbone hews to a  code of individualism that keeps him from committing to the notion of a  civil society.  The political climate is fertile statehood is being discussed and will  change everything bringing the rule of law and threatening the open  range. At the local meeting to elect representatives Valance tries to  disrupt the proceedings but is held in place by Doniphon. Stoddard  nominates Doniphon as a man uniquely qualified to represent the region.  If he accepts the nomination he unites physical and legal authority  bringing order to Shinbone and relegates Valance to the periphery. But  he refuses. Accepting such a role is incongruent with his notions of  individuality. Stoddard and the newspaper editor are instead elected.  Valance vows revenge. Instead of supporting Stoddard Doniphon counsels  flight. He arranges a buckboard to take Stoddard out of town before  Valance arrives that night to have it out with him.  Doniphon's abdication leaves Stoddard with the decision leave the town  in the clutches of Valance or stand and challenge him. Stoddard calls  Valance out. Valance toys with him shooting the gun out of his hand.  Stoddard picks up the gun. Valance takes aim. Stoddard fires. Valance  falls dead. Miraculously Stoddard has liberated the town also winning  the heart of Hallie.  Wayne goes on a bender drinking himself into a stupor then burns down  his home symbolically burning his own hopes for the future. He has  lost everything. But the depth of his loss only becomes apparent later.  Stoddard goes to the state convention heralded as The Man Who Shot  Liberty Valance. On this wave of popularity he is elected to  represent the state in Washington launching his career. As he is  elected Doniphon enters the hall. He is drunk and haggard. He calls  Stoddard into a back room and confronts him.  You didn't shoot Valance Pilgrim he tells Stoddard Think back  Pilgrim.  We dissolve to the gunfight in the street this time from Doniphon's  POV. He stands in an alley. As Valance makes his final shot Doniphon  shoots him the shot simultaneous with Stoddard's killing Valence but  in a manner without honor. In doing so he loses his self respect and  violates the code by which he has lived.  This illuminates his raging drunk. All is lost. Wayne approaches the  tragic in this role. He was the best but because of the limitations of  his code he defers acting against Valance and defers again. When  leadership comes his way he refuses. When events force him to act he  must do so in a manner that is dishonorable. Doniphon's only sin is  that of pridehe will not stoop to the needs of the group and holds  himself aloof. For this alone he fails and ultimately transgresses  against all he stands for.  When Stoddard and his wife return to Shinbone for the funeral their  solemnity springs guilt. Stoddard has traded on the Valance shooting  his entire career and he knows that he has lived a lie. Ironically the  reporter tears up the story at the end saying When the legend becomes  the truth print the legend.  John Ford made the western what it is today. Here he gives us movie  that is a complex and at times sardonic critique of the genre while  at the same time giving Wayne his deepest most tragic role. There was  not to be another western of equivalent depth until Clint Eastwood's  Unforgiven. It rewards repeated viewing and is a capstone to the career  of Mr. Wayne.".

	schema:headline " One of the great westerns of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "John Ford's 1962 film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is an ode to the end of the classic western. It is a satiric look at the civilizing of the once wild American west where Ford deliberately uses stereotypical characters and situations to undermine and reexamine the very myths that he helped create. Ford's world is one of moral certainty and untamed villainy where legends are born and cowboy heroes ride free amidst the broad natural landscapes of America's West. In the west of Liberty Valance the hero is not made nor born but manufactured by the media. As the editor of the Shinbone Star says This is the West. When the legend becomes the fact print the legend.The legend concerns lawyer Ransom Stoddard played in typical earnest awshucks fashion by Jimmy Stewart. Stoddard has been brought bruised and beaten to the western town of Shinbone following an altercation with a gang of stagecoach highwaymen led by archvillain Liberty Valance. As played by Lee Marvin Valance is deadpan and overthe top evil. His uncompromising performance is one of the pleasures of the film.

	onyx:emotionText "John Ford's 1962 film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is an ode to the end of the classic western. It is a satiric look at the civilizing of the once wild American west where Ford deliberately uses stereotypical characters and situations to undermine and reexamine the very myths that he helped create. Ford's world is one of moral certainty and untamed villainy where legends are born and cowboy heroes ride free amidst the broad natural landscapes of America's West. In the west of Liberty Valance the hero is not made nor born but manufactured by the media. As the editor of the Shinbone Star says This is the West. When the legend becomes the fact print the legend.The legend concerns lawyer Ransom Stoddard played in typical earnest awshucks fashion by Jimmy Stewart. Stoddard has been brought bruised and beaten to the western town of Shinbone following an altercation with a gang of stagecoach highwaymen led by archvillain Liberty Valance. As played by Lee Marvin Valance is deadpan and overthe top evil. His uncompromising performance is one of the pleasures of the film. With his lethal black whip and his giggling and glowering henchmen played by Strother Martin and Lee VanCleef Marvin is unabashedly nasty and taunting at every turn. His nemesis is that stalwart icon of the heroic west John Wayne as Tom Doniphan. His code of honor is as solid as his skill with a sixgun.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a sad movie in many ways. Ford is closing the book on his meditations on progress here. The black and white photography itself is rather depressing  most of the scenes including all the important ones seem to take place at night in the dark. And what do they show us? As Edmund O'Brien puts it the West began with Indians and buffalo and the only law was survival. Then the cattlemen moved in and took the land over and the law was that of the hired gun. Now the West has been settled by hardworking farmers and turns into a garden once the power brokers are out of the way. But it's a wistful garden. The cactus roses have disappeared and been replaced by turnips. And the rowdy raucous plainspeaking heroes and villains have been replaced by pretentious blowhard politicians of the sort that Ransom Stoddard James Stewart has become.The framing story begins with Senator Stewart and his wife Vera Miles coming back to Shinbone for the funeral of the uknown Tom Doniphon John Wayne. Where are his boots? Stewart asks upon seeing Wayne's body laid out Put his boots on. Ford claimed this incident was borrowed from Tom Mix's funeral. A few of the old crowd are still around but the streets of Shinbone are empty and are a tired gray. Everyone is now old. Stewart patronizes Wayne's old retainer Pompey Woody Strode giving him a handful of bills and saying Pork chop money. Some garden!Well if the present is filled with nostalgia the past is lively enough and the flashback which is to say most of the film is full of action and gusto. People just don't eat in John Qualen's restaurant. They eat huge platters of steaks beans potatoes and deep dish apple pie. The steaks come sizzling from the vast greasy grill and are large enough to hang over the edges of the oversized platters. Lee Marvin and his henchmen Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin enact their villainy with relish. John Wayne is of course the hero of the tale. You can tell because in addition to his John Wayneness he wears the only black and white outfit in the cast which draws attention to his figure whenever it is on screen. In fact though Wayne does a reasonably decent job of playing Doniphon after his fall. When he enters the political meeting toward the end banging open the swinging doors staggering slightly bearded shabby his magnificent white hat replaced by a battered gray one slightly bleary he looks and acts like a man who has been defeated but has not yet died putting up a brave front with nothing left behind to prop it up. He's not bad in this scene. For the most part though he plays John Wayne the resolute proud man of principle. Edmund O'Brien is the comic town drunk and editor the Thomas Mitchell part and is given some amusing lines including quotes from Henry V. Actually O'Brien was pretty good in MGM's Julius Caesar as Casca making Shakepeare's lines believable enough.The principle Doniphon represents however is O'Brien's second stage of the West's development. He's not only a rancher but a gunman soon to be replaced by farmers and lawyers but it's only at the final shootout that he realizes it. He saves Stewart's life the oldfashioned way then gives up any plans of marriage to Vera Miles gets drunk and drives himself and Pompey back to the ranch he'd planned as a home. He burns the ranch down. He and Strode had a problem shooting the arrival at the ranch. Wayne lost control of the horses and Strode reached over to help. Wayne pushed him brusquely out of the way and Strode fell from the wagon. Angry he threatened Wayne and Wayne responded the way Wayne would respond. Strode a former fullback was several years younger than Wayne and in good shape. Ford stopped the altercation by shouting that the movie needed Wayne's face in one piece.For all its darkness however the movie reflects some of Ford's prejudices in his comic way. A pompous orator at the political meeting John Carradine announces in his stentorian public voice that he came here with a carefully prepared speech but is going to disregard it and speak the truth. Here he crinkles up the speech and throws it contemptuously to the floor. Someone picks the page up and uncrumples it to find it blank on both sides. The rhetoric is extremely funny  The bulletriddled body of an honest citizen?  recalling Donald Meek in Young Mister Lincoln. During a carefully choreographed spontaneous demonstration after the cattlemen's candidate has been nominated a band plays a cowboy rides up onto the speaker's platform and twirls a lasso and there is a brief shot of the Chairman staring appalled at the cowboy's horse lapping water out of the chairman's pitcher.But it's still a sad comment from Ford. His earlier work brimmed with hope for the future. Here the future has arrived and it makes one long for the past. The principled lawyer is now a windbag politician. It's the way an old man might feel about life in general.It's the way anyone of maturity might feel about reviewing his past when faced with an almost unrecognizable younger person who happens to bear his name.".

	schema:reviewBody "Senator James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles get a telegram from their old home in Shinbone about the death of a friend. They arrive in Shinbone and go to a sparsely attended service. When prodded a bit by the editor of the Shinbone Star a paper he was once employed at Stewart sits down and tells the story of just how his political career got its start.The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is John Ford's final homage to the western film genre that made his reputation. It's maybe the most nostalgic of westerns he ever did. Beginning with the cast all of whom are way too old for their parts. But if you notice there's a kind of soft focus photography used on John Wayne James Stewart and Lee Marvin which masks their age. The skill of these players does the rest.Stewart arrives in Shinbone a newly minted attorney who has taken Horace Greeley's advice and the stagecoach he's riding on gets held up by the local outlaw Liberty Valance and henchmen. When Stewart protests Valance played by Lee Marvin beats him with the butt end of a silver knob whip and leaves him on the road.He's found by John Wayne who brings him to Shinbone to get medical attention. Stewart stays with restaurant owners John Qualen and Jenanette Nolan and their daughter Vera Miles who's Wayne's girl. Miles who can't even read or write takes quite a shine to the educated easterner.But Stewart and newspaper editor Edmond O'Brien keep getting on Liberty Valance's bad side especially when they come out publicly for statehood whereas the big cattle ranchers who hire Liberty Valance and henchmen want to keep this part of the USA a territory for as long as they can. This is all leading to an inevitable showdown.Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance is one evil man. No subtle psychology here no explanations of a mom who didn't love him or a girl that dumped him he's just an evil guy who likes being evil. If Liberty has any redeeming qualities despite repeated viewings of this film I haven't found any. Marvin clearly enjoyed this part but he never turned it into a burlesque of himself. That he waited for Cat Ballou to do.John Wayne who by this time was playing more roughhewn types than he did when he was Ringo Kid in Stagecoach gets back to that kind of a portrayal here. He's more Ringo than he is Ethan Edwards. But that's at the beginning. Over the course of the film he changes into something like Ethan Edwards his character from The Searchers. What happens to make him that way in fact is the story of the film. But actually the film really does belong to Stewart. He's on screen for most of it he's the protagonist here and until almost the end what's happening to him is what The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is all about. Ford once again rounds out his cast with many of his favorite players in support. Andy Devine as the cowardly marshal John Carradine as a pompous windbag politician Woody Strode Denver Pyle Strother Martin all who had appeared in Ford films before.There are two to single out however. This was the last film Jack Pennick ever did with John Ford. You might not know his name but he and that horseface countenance appeared in just about every sound John Ford film there is. He has a bit role as a bartender. Pennick died after completing this film.Edmond O'Brien made his one and only appearance in this film as Dutton Peabody founder editor and owner of the Shinbone Star and as he said himself he sweeps the place out occasionally. He's a regular character in Ford films the wise friend of the hero who has a bit of a drinking problem. Kind of like Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone in Stagecoach. Like Stewart O'Brien is an eastern immigrant who came west to be his own newspaper editor like his former boss Horace Greeley. Words are his weapons like the law is Stewart's. It's no wonder that these two annoy Lee Marvin so. Even the fast draw hired gun can't kill public opinion. When they're both chosen as Shinbone's Delegates to the territorial convention it is O'Brien who makes the nominating speech to draft Stewart for the job. It is one of his finest bits in his long and distinguished career. It encapsulates a lot of what Ford was trying to say about progress and progress in the American west. In the end it is the farmer the merchant the builder of cities will eventually triumph just about anywhere. Stewart and he are as much pioneers as Wayne and the others in Shinbone are they're just the next logical step.Progress always comes at a price. We see the price in the beginning and the end of the film the scenes of Shinbone during the early Twentieth Century. The paved streets the electric lights are there because of who came before and what they did. There wasn't room in the changing west for many like Wayne and Marvin their time came and went just as Stewart's time came and went too.Actually I think the real winner in this film was always Vera Miles. She started out as an illiterate girl working in her parent's restaurant and wound up the wife of a United States Senator. That's progress too.".

No subtle psychology here no explanations of a mom who didn't love him or a girl that dumped him he's just an evil guy who likes being evil. If Liberty has any redeeming qualities despite repeated viewings of this film I haven't found any. Marvin clearly enjoyed this part but he never turned it into a burlesque of himself. That he waited for Cat Ballou to do.John Wayne who by this time was playing more roughhewn types than he did when he was Ringo Kid in Stagecoach gets back to that kind of a portrayal here. He's more Ringo than he is Ethan Edwards. But that's at the beginning. Over the course of the film he changes into something like Ethan Edwards his character from The Searchers. What happens to make him that way in fact is the story of the film. But actually the film really does belong to Stewart. He's on screen for most of it he's the protagonist here and until almost the end what's happening to him is what The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is all about. Ford once again rounds out his cast with many of his favorite players in support. Andy Devine as the cowardly marshal John Carradine as a pompous windbag politician Woody Strode Denver Pyle Strother Martin all who had appeared in Ford films before.There are two to single out however. This was the last film Jack Pennick ever did with John Ford. You might not know his name but he and that horseface countenance appeared in just about every sound John Ford film there is. He has a bit role as a bartender. Pennick died after completing this film.Edmond O'Brien made his one and only appearance in this film as Dutton Peabody founder editor and owner of the Shinbone Star and as he said himself he sweeps the place out occasionally. He's a regular character in Ford films the wise friend of the hero who has a bit of a drinking problem. Kind of like Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone in Stagecoach. Like Stewart O'Brien is an eastern immigrant who came west to be his own newspaper editor like his former boss Horace Greeley. Words are his weapons like the law is Stewart's. It's no wonder that these two annoy Lee Marvin so. Even the fast draw hired gun can't kill public opinion. When they're both chosen as Shinbone's Delegates to the territorial convention it is O'Brien who makes the nominating speech to draft Stewart for the job. It is one of his finest bits in his long and distinguished career. It encapsulates a lot of what Ford was trying to say about progress and progress in the American west. In the end it is the farmer the merchant the builder of cities will eventually triumph just about anywhere. Stewart and he are as much pioneers as Wayne and the others in Shinbone are they're just the next logical step.Progress always comes at a price. We see the price in the beginning and the end of the film the scenes of Shinbone during the early Twentieth Century. The paved streets the electric lights are there because of who came before and what they did. There wasn't room in the changing west for many like Wayne and Marvin their time came and went just as Stewart's time came and went too.Actually I think the real winner in this film was always Vera Miles. She started out as an illiterate girl working in her parent's restaurant and wound up the wife of a United States Senator. That's progress too.";

NO.  He seeks justice by the book.  You see he's an attorney at law and he desires to see civilised leanings spring up all over 'south of the Picket Wire'.  Laughable really.  The only law in the wildwest is the law of the gun.  That's what's kept tough rancher Tom Doniphan Wayne alive.  And it's the only thing that will work for Stoddard... or is it?!?Ford doesn't pretend that he's got anything new here.  God no!  What he's clearly interested in is the marriage and divorce! of the primal and the cerebral.  He set's the whole thing in the wildwest a genric canvas second to none and relies on character and emotion to lead us way beyond the obvious plot.  And what he delivers is a sublime debate on the interdependency of force and reason.  For there are those not prepared to listen to reason and those disenfranchised by the reliance on force and Ransom Stoddard eventually acknowledges this embraces the essence of both codes and thereby supercedes Doniphan as the real 'hero' of the new renaissance of the American West.This is an excellent piece of metaphorical mythology.  The monochrome teases us of a 'black and white' world within which the 'reality' of life is oft contained within the shadows.  Ford's direction of comedy and drama has never been bettered by himself not even in the somewhat ponderous 'My Darling Clementine' and the dialogue risks allowing wisdom in Doniphon's horsepoke to be matched by an often acerbic nononsense Stoddard.  The characters and the actors within them are uniformly excellent.  Stewart never puts a foot wrong and this is the highwater mark of Wayne's dramatic capability.  The scene in which he realises his love is unrequited and subsequently drinks himself into oblivion reveals a depth few could have thought him capable of.  Special mention must also go to Edmond O'Brien's avoidance of surely tempting caricaturing the newspaper editor and instead creating a most believable bridge of humanity between the values of the wild west and the civilised east.  Lee Marvin's sullen rendition of the bad guy Valance is also outstanding.  And it is to Ford's credit that you are always left uncertain as to whether Valance or Doniphan was the tougher cowboy.The idea of a developing world allowing us to metaphorise our own understanding of and relationship with existence is as old as Zeus and the God's that preceded him and in the developing new world of the American west nobody examined that potential better or more profoundly than John Ford.  And this film is one of the crowning moments of that examination.".

	schema:headline " A great Western!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was the last Western that John Ford and John Wayne made together. The film also stars James Stewart who plays Ransom Stoddard a young lawyer who later becomes a senator. In the movie Ford explores the differences that exist between the facts of Ransom Stoddard's life and the legend that has sprung up around him. Ford shows us that people would rather believe a legend than know the truth about a famous person and about the events of his or her life. This is especially true about the heroes of the Wild West era.There may be no era that has been more mythologized and romanticized than that of the Old West. In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance Maxwell Scott editor of The Shinbone Star proclaims This is the West Sir. When the legend becomes fact print the legend. Ford's movie seems to suggest that much of what we think we know about the Old West may not be based on fact. The movie begins and ends with a scene of a train in motion. In the opening scene the train is seen coming towards the camera and towards the small town of Shinbone where most of the action will take place. Then at the end of the movie after the story has been told the train is seen riding away from the camera and from Shinbone.The film's two main characters are Tom Doniphon a rugged frontier's man who is played by Wayne and Stoddard who is played by Stewart. Other significant characters include Liberty Valance Lee Marvin the snarling hatefilled outlaw Hallie Vera Miles a young lady who both Tom and Ransom are in love with Link Appleyard Andy Devine Shinbone's fainthearted Marshal Dutton Peabody the lovable drunkard and editor of the local newspaper The Shinbone Star and Doc Willoughby who is Shinbone's physician and who also is a drunk.In the movie these characters come together and mix and clash with one another in Shinbone a place where the lawless ways of the West seem to hold sway. Link Appleyard the town's Marshal represents the power of the Law in Shinbone and he is a spineless man who cowers every time someone like Liberty Valance comes near. Doniphon tries to teach Stoddard what Western Law is like when he tells Ransom I know those law books mean a lot to you but not out here. Out here a man settles his own problems.But Ransom Stoddard refuses to accept that way of life. He has come to town and he represents law and order and the settled ways of the East. It is true that when he first arrives he is unconscious after having received a vicious beating at the hands of Liberty Valance and it is also true that next to the stalwart Tom Doniphon and the venomous Liberty Valance Ransom doesn't seem very strong but nevertheless he has come to stay as he tells Doniphon I'm staying and I'm not buying a gun.The movie also focuses on the inevitable conflict brought on by the encroachment of the Eastern way of life upon the Western way. This conflict is seen represented in Hallie who is torn between her attraction for Doniphon the frontier man and Stoddard the man of the East. Doniphon woos her with a cactus rose a symbol of his way of life while Stoddard asks Hallie if she has ever seen a real rose. Hallie says she hasn't and she shows her ignorance of the Eastern way of life when Mr. Peabody tries to teach her the proprieties concerning the cutlery.How many times have I told you the fork goes to the left of the plate? And the knife goes Hallie interrupts him and asks What's the matter with you? You superstitious or something?Hallie knows that if she chooses to be with Ransom she will have to change. But her first impulse is to resist change. When Ransom offers to teach her to read and write she says What good will that do around here? Later however she relents and accepts Ransom's offer. Unlike Hallie who decides to accept the Eastern way of life and the changes that come with it Liberty Valance and Tom Doniphon both refuse to change and they both die because of their unwillingness though each dies in a different way. Valance who passionately hates Stoddard and all he represents tries unsuccessfully to destroy first Mr. Peabody and his newspaper press and then Ransom himself. In the end Valance who has lived by the sword dies a violent death at the hands of Tom Doniphon. And the latter after realizing that he has killed a man in cold blood and that he has lost Hallie to Stoddard self destructs he starts drinking heavily and sets his house as well as his life on fire.And Stoddard? What happens to him? He becomes famous because everyone except for Hallie thinks that he is the man who shot Liberty Valance and he gets the girl and goes on to have a successful career in Washington. But without the help of noble and honest men like Doniphon men like Stoddard wouldn't have been able to survive in the West.John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is an intelligent insightful and greatly entertaining movie.".

But considering that this is a 40yearold picture such doozies are rare.Overall this is an absolute classic that has aged remarkably well.Teaming the nerdy decent Jimmy Stewart with the commanding decent John Wayne for this story was perfect. So many great quotes but probably my favorite is when Pompey Tom Doniphan's black servant ? apologizes to his teacher Stewart's Stoddard for forgetting during recitation the line in the Delcaration that all men are created equal.That's OK Pompey a lot of people forget that part Stewart wryly quips  in a movie released just as the civil rights movement was on the rise 1962.And John Wayne as usual is just THE MAN. When Doniphan asks Valance to pick up Doniphan's steak after Valance had tripped Stoddard who had been serving it and one of Valance's toadies bends down to pick it up instead Doniphan just kicks the toady square in the face and knocks him on his a barely even exerting himself or breaking stride.Later the same toady I think draws a gun on Doniphan from pointblank range and Doniphan simply TAKES THE GUN AWAY with one hand and knocks the dork down with the other in one move.Also the newspaper editor was a nearlyconstant hoot and the town doctor summed up my feelings whenever a to borrow a phrase towering bstard dies. Rushing to the scene of Valance's shooting he snaps Whiskey quick! He takes a big drink eyes the bleeding inert Valance halfshrugs and says Dead. Then walks away.See it if you haven't.

The passage of time and a keener focus reveals a lot more going on in this movie than a conflict between two good men and the killing of an outlaw gunman. Surface generalities aside the story is about the passing of an era with the bullets of a bygone time about to be replaced by the subtler but just as lethal machinations of the political machine.There's another way to look at the events surrounding the death of Liberty Valance Lee Marvin. Suppose Tom Doniphon John Wayne made up the story about shooting Valance to save Ransom Stoddard's hide. It would have been just another savage way of further emasculating Jimmy Stewart's character upon realizing that Hallie Vera Miles was never going to be his girl. After all he wasn't above humiliating Ranse with the mean spirited paint can demonstration where his rage was more palpable. I'm not advancing that hypothesis by the way but it's an interesting conjecture that fits and isn't denied by any of the other facts of the story.There's a rather strange moment in the picture that director Ford opted to keep. When Stoddard addresses the town meeting about to nominate representatives to Washington he walks from behind a desk and hits his head on the bottom of the stairwell. He looks at the stair and without skipping a beat keeps on talking to the audience. I wonder if it hurt?Even stranger though is the sequence when Wayne's character leaves town after drinking heavily and arrives home with his ward Pompey Woody Strode. In town he has a black shirt arriving at home it's a light colored one. Breaking the door in the shirt is black again and when Pompey saves him from the fire it's not only light colored again but with a set of buttons that go down to the belt line. Finally the shirt is black again in the final scene of that sequence.For his final team up with John Wayne Ford seems to go for caricature with many of the figures here. Most obvious is Lee Marvin's title character Liberty Valance. He's pretty much allowed free reign as a nut case and even though Andy Devine's usual persona as a do nothing lawman is somewhat expected he's totally ineffective in enforcing anything in the town of Shinbone. Liberty's henchman Floyd Strother Martin is irritating as a whiny outlaw and Lee Van Cleef has disappointingly too little screen time to be of consequence. Perhaps the most over the top performance is delivered by John Carradine with macho exuberance and a name to match as Major Cassius Starbuckle.There's a lot going on in 'Liberty Valance' with repeat viewings recommended to uncover even more nuances. This is one Western that doesn't fit the typical mold where preconceptions are shot down like cans on a fence post. It's a look at the wild west coming to an end with a blend of nostalgia romance and grit that offers an effective glimpse at legend before succumbing to fact.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a tragedy about the passing of the Old West represented metaphorically in the passing of Tom Doniphon. That Ford chose to tell his tale of largerthanlife Tom Doniphon a heroic figure reduced to a pair of beatup boots and a crumpled hat as a reminiscence of Jimmy Stewart's Ransom Stoddard only adds to the nostalgia. Senator Stoddard and his wife have come by train to Shinbone a once rugged frontier outpost intending to pay their respects and then slip quietly back to Washington. Waylayed by an aggressive newspaper editor who insists on knowing the story behind the story of the senator's sudden and secretive appearance in town Stoddard agrees to tell the truth about the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.It was here in Shinbone many years ago that young lawyer Ransom Stoddard seeking his fortune in the West recovered from a vicious beating at the hands of Liberty Valance a malcontent and highwayman wellknown as a hired gun for the interests of the cattlemen who run the territory. Valance holds up the stage coach Ransom is riding and when Ransom intervenes on behalf of a female passenger he is beaten and whipped and left for dead beside the trail. Tom Doniphon equally wellknown for his toughness and prowess with a gun stands on the side of law and order. It was Tom who drove out and found Ransom bringing him into town in the back of a buckboard wagon and overseeing the details of his recovery. Stoddard swears he will have Valance brought to justice by putting him in jail an assertion eliciting wry amusement from Tom who chides Ransom for thinking that he can solve the problem of Liberty Valance with anything other than a gun.In time Stoddard's greenhorn optimism and complete trust in the power of the law are tempered by the realities of frontier life. The local Marshall is a bumbling incompetent more interested in mooching his next meal than in confronting Valance who openly defies the law by parading around town and bullying the townspeople. Valance is kept in check only by Tom Doniphon who brandishes the threat of gun play but never has to draw his pistol because Valance fears him. Quietly Stoddard purchases a gun and practices shooting it.When the political issue of statehood arises in the territory Liberty Valance tries to intimidate the townspeople and secure the interests of the cattlemen who oppose statehood but is thwarted by Doniphon and Stoddard who supply the muscle and the mind necessary to rouse the town into sending two prostatehood delegates to the convention. One of these is Stoddard himself and the other is Dutton Peabody editor of the local newspaper the Shinbone Star. True to form Valance vents his frustration by trashing the newspaper office at night and thrashing Peabody to within an inch of his life. In the subsequent gunfight between Stoddard and Valance Valance toys with Stoddard and wounds him in the right arm before Stoddard gets off an unlikely shot that kills Valance. Thus Stoddard's reputation as The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance precedes him at the convention where he is ridiculed by the proterritory orator Major Cassius Starbuckle as a gunwielding yahoo unworthy of being taken seriously as a spokesman for statehood.Anguished by what he perceives as his own betrayal of the principles of law that he so ardently espoused Stoddard quits the convention only to find Tom Doniphon waiting for him. Here we learn that is was Doniphon himself lurking in the shadows that fateful night who shot Liberty Valance timing his rifle shot to coincide with Stoddard's pistol shot. Doniphon convinces Stoddard to return to the convention and thus begins the illustrious political career of a man whose reputation as The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a lie that he never corrects.Until now of course. Now we understand why the Senator wanted to slip in and out of Shinbone without fanfare precisely to avoid the circumstances that have led to his confessional tale. But Stoddard is too moral a man to leave so large a lie uncorrected. Hearing the truth for the first time the newspaper editor refuses to print it preferring the legend to the reality.The film ultimately becomes a statement about the sadness of progress and how the rough and ready life of the colorful frontier West gives way to a more modern world marked not by gun play but by wordplay one safer but blander.The final shot of the film is the train taking Senator Stoddard and his wife back to Washington. We see it from the back pulling away and leaving us behind. Chatting animatedly aboard the train the senator and his wife express an eagerness to return to Shinbone but we know that they probably never will.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anticipating Peckinpah and Eastwood John Ford's Hamletlike Western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance deconstructs the legends of the Old West as a place where good always triumphed over evil and civilization overcame barbarism a myth that he helped to create. Ford's 1962 film based on the story by Dorothy M. Johnson looks at how myths are created and in its complex vision of the passing of an era both pines for the lawless open spaces and eagerly anticipates the railroads bringing paved roads schools and law enforcement. The film contains the classic phrase When truth becomes legend print the legend cited by a journalist who refuses to print newly discovered facts about an incident surrounded in myth that took place years before.While there are stereotypes and alltoo familiar stock characters Liberty Valance succeeds because of strong performances by John Wayne as the macho embodiment of the old school and Jimmy Stewart as the man who brings literacy and respect for law to the small town though unconvincing as a young man just out of law school. Shot in black and white on a studio sound stage the film opens with grayhaired Senator Ransom Stoddard James Stewart arriving at a small frontier town named Shinbone with his wife Hallie Vera Miles. Met at the train station by a reporter eager for a story Senator Stoddard tells him that he came to attend the funeral of an old friend Tom Doniphon John Wayne.It is there that he reunites with Tom's dependable ranch hand Pompey Woody Strode and since no one remembers Tom Doniphon relates his story that takes us back to the time before the coming of the railroads. As Stoddard tells it he was a young law graduate who arrived from the East in a stagecoach following the advice Go West young man and grow up with the country first made in 1851 by John B. L. Soule editor of the Terre Haute Express and incorrectly attributed to Horace Greeley. His welcome to Shinbone however is not what he had hoped. He is met by a sadistic bandit named Liberty Valance Lee Marvin who robs the stagecoach and beats Stoddard after he tries to protect a female passenger.Rancher Tom Doniphon finds him unconscious and brings him to Hallie his girlfriend's house. When Stoddard recovers he asks the Marshal Link Appleyard Andy Devine to make an arrest but Doniphon soon sets him straight about how justice is done in Shinbone  with the barrel of a gun. Without money Stoddard works in the family restaurant as a dishwasher and also for the editor of the local newspaper a man named Dutton Peabody Edmond O'Brien who is overly fond of the bottle.Ransom develops an interest in Hallie and soon sets up classes to teach her and other locals how to read and write and also to convey the finer points of democracy and its institutions. Threatened by Valance and taunted by Doniphon Stoddard goes against his ideals and learns how to shoot a gun with the help of Doniphon who educates him and shows him the error of his liberal ways.After Stoddard and Peabody defeat Valance in an election to be representatives to the Sate Senate and an editorial appears contrasting the goals of statehood with the interests of Valance and the cattlemen Dutton is severely beaten by Valance who then baits Stoddard into a gunfight. The showdown between Stoddard and Liberty is the centerpiece of the film and the shot heard round the West allows the victor to build an entire career based on the incident.The legend of Shinbone will soon be joined by reallife icons Wyatt Earp Wild Bill Hickok Buffalo Bill and Kit Carson and the truth about the West with its corruption misogyny domination of the weak by the strong and Native American genocide will be quietly buried. John Ford helped to romanticize the West and create the myth and now in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance he allows us to understand its melancholy and its lie.".

Without money Stoddard works in the family restaurant as a dishwasher and also for the editor of the local newspaper a man named Dutton Peabody Edmond O'Brien who is overly fond of the bottle.Ransom develops an interest in Hallie and soon sets up classes to teach her and other locals how to read and write and also to convey the finer points of democracy and its institutions. Threatened by Valance and taunted by Doniphon Stoddard goes against his ideals and learns how to shoot a gun with the help of Doniphon who educates him and shows him the error of his liberal ways.After Stoddard and Peabody defeat Valance in an election to be representatives to the Sate Senate and an editorial appears contrasting the goals of statehood with the interests of Valance and the cattlemen Dutton is severely beaten by Valance who then baits Stoddard into a gunfight. The showdown between Stoddard and Liberty is the centerpiece of the film and the shot heard round the West allows the victor to build an entire career based on the incident.The legend of Shinbone will soon be joined by reallife icons Wyatt Earp Wild Bill Hickok Buffalo Bill and Kit Carson and the truth about the West with its corruption misogyny domination of the weak by the strong and Native American genocide will be quietly buried. John Ford helped to romanticize the West and create the myth and now in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance he allows us to understand its melancholy and its lie.";

	schema:reviewBody "With a remake in the works it's time now to reevaluate The Man who Shot Liberty Valance. Wikipedia informs us that the iconic film director John Ford considered it his favorite film. And critic Roger Ebert wrote that each of the ten FordWayne westerns is ... complete and selfcontained in a way that approaches perfection and singled out Liberty Valance as the most pensive and thoughtful of the group.It begins with a much too long expository scene. Senator Ransom Ranse Stoddard played by James Stewart made up to be well into his seventies along with his wife Hallie Vera Miles return to the frontier town of Shinbone to attend the funeral of Stoddard's old cowboy friend Tom Doniphon John Wayne. Oddly the town newspaper editor never heard of Doniphon despite his legendary reputation made clear by Stoddard who then relates both his and Doniphon's story at the editor's behest.The presence of a telephone at the railway station in the opening scene suggests that the story begins a little after the turn of the century possibly 1905. Stoddard relates how he came to Shinbone years earlier as an idealistic young attorney where he immediately was drastically assaulted by Liberty Valance during a stagecoach robbery. Can we assume this might have occurred 25 years earlier perhaps around 1880? Stoddard as a young attorney would probably have been about 30 years old Stewart is miscast here as he was a little over 50 when he acted in Ford's picture.Now the location of the story is never revealed but a big part of the plot revolves around homesteaders and big ranchers. The homesteaders which include small landowners small farmers etc. are in favor of statehood and the moneyed interests cattle barons etc. oppose them. While historians inform us that for the most part the wild west was relatively nonviolent especially in comparison to what's happening today particularly in the big cities there was one bloody conflict the Johnson County War which occurred in Johnson Wyoming between 1889 and 1893 which may have been the model for the conflict alluded to in Liberty Valance.One glaringly major omission we notice right away is that the hated big ranchers are never seen during the entire narrative. Instead the sadistic criminal Liberty Valance is made out to be their enforcer. It's hard to buy that idea since historically the moneyed interests banded together and created an organization the Wyoming Stock Growers Association the WSGA which hired detectives to police the rangegoing after rustlers who were poaching on their land. But even if you buy the idea that a criminal like Valance might have ended up as some kind of private contractor for the WSGA the idea that everyone in the town of Shinbone was a milquetoast epitomized by the bumbling sheriff played by Andy Devine and was afraid to stand up to someone like Valance is absurd. Here only Tom Doniphon has the guts to stand up to Valance along with Stoddard who advocates a nonviolent approach.After some small ranchers were falsely accused by WSGA detectives as rustlers and were killed the homesteaders formed their own organization the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association NWFSGA. As Wikipedia informs us the WSGA hired 23 gunmen and 4 cattle detectives and ended up assassinating the head of the NWFSGA. Various dignitaries including a State Senator joined the gunmen and in response now read this! the Sheriff in the nearby town of Buffalo GATHERED A POSSE OF 200 MEN and ended up cornering the WSGA men at a ranch where there was a standoff for two days. Only the intervention of Federal troops on orders from President Benjamin Harrison prevented further bloodshed. So much for wimpy homesteaders!The cowardice of the townspeople in the film is contradicted by history and the idea that Doniphon is the only man in town who can stand up to Valance is absurd. There were tough characters on both sides of the range war and a character like Valance would never have been allowed to get away with terrorizing the populace as is depicted here. Why Doniphon doesn't take Valance out before the climactic duel with Stoddard makes little sense considering Valance is already wanted for murdering two people during a robbery not to mention the robbery of the stagecoach and Stoddard's brutal beating recounted by the elderly Senator as the beginning of the break into Act 2.Another plot contrivance which I find hard to swallow is the idea that a Senator from the frontier would have taken up the mantle of pacifism during that time. The wimpy Stoddard is such a pacifist that he walks out after being nominated to represent the proStatehood forces in Congress. Why does he walk out? Because he feels guilty that he violated his pacifist precepts by shooting Liberty Valance. It's only AFTER Doniphon reveals that it was he who shot Valance that Stoddard has a change of heart. Now his guilt is assuaged and he can accept the nomination. The only thing good about this film is the twist that it was Doniphon and not Stoddard who shot Liberty Valance. After the duel the rest is anticlimactic. Wimpy Stoddard goes on to become Senator and Doniphon takes to the bottle after he fails to get the girl. It's odd that macho John Wayne accepted the Tom Doniphon part. Perhaps he liked the idea that the macho Doniphon was a flawed character who could so easily selfdestruct. I can't but help also suggest that Liberty is a parable about McCarthyism considering the film's release in 1962. Doniphon might have been a standin for McCarthy who took to the bottle after being censured by the Senate. The fight might have been justified but the methods weren't. Doniphon must pay a priceand it's the pacifist Stoddard who is ultimately rewarded.".

It had to have something to do with how the story unfolded. Turns out that this is indeed the problem. The first 45 minutes of The I Inside are really a blast. The story sucks you in immediately and unfolds beautifully until a certain point is reached where the writer lost control and messed up what had been set up so well. All of a sudden the story's getting way over the top apparently for no other reason than to keep the viewer puzzled. That wouldn't have been necessary. They could have taken the story anywhere as intriguing as it started. Unfortunately the plot becomes uneven when the rules of the movie are adapted arbitrarily. The final solution doesn't really come as a surprise anymore. Worse still it's not good enough to explain everything. It's obvious that there are mistakes and flaws throughout the script and it's a shame because as I've said unlike a lot of other movies where the story is already set up for an impossible unbelievable ending The I Inside had a more than promising start. Anyway although the movie isn't completely satisfying and kind of stumbles over its own feet it's still very entertaining to watch. It has an atmospheric stage playlike atmosphere in fact the story has been adapted from a play called Point Of Death and there are some really creative suspense scenes. Summing up The I Inside isn't the masterpiece it could have been but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are serious spoilers below.Any sort of storytelling is about engagement and one of the most interesting engagement strategies is the puzzle story. This comes in several varieties starting with the detective story which plainly presents you with a mystery and a surrogate in the story with whom you presumably collaborate. At the other end are the surprise puzzles that present you with information at the end that makes you reevaluate what you knew Sixth Sense Usual Suspects.The ones that are the most fun are the ones whose puzzles are a serious challenge and which don't wrap up cleanly at the end. Memento and Fight Club were great fun because you carried the narrative around for days afterward and because it was purely cinematic you essentially lived in the movie overlain on your own world.Then there's the subclass of cinematic narrative within that group. Here's where you have a puzzle with several solutions. Naturally the simplest one is the one usually considered true. But it leaves some loose ends that are considered mistakes or merely superfluous. But a nonnovice puzzlesolver can see the deeper solution.Irreversible Identity and Primer are examples of this. And this film is another.The story is that a young man awakens in a hospital in 2002. He discovers he was there also on that day in 2000 the victim of an accident and he cannot recall the intervening two years. The two periods overlap. There are threats and two women that appear and disappear.The novice solution is that he his brother and a shared woman got involved in a happenstance that ended in them all dying in a car accident in 2000. This setup and accident incidentally are prototypically noir. So the movie invokes a movie with unreal characteristics instead of real. Our hero dies for two minutes is resuscitated and dies again immediately. The solution is that all we have seen is the two minutes in his mind envisioned as two years and him trying to come to terms with the noir mechanics of the accident that killed his brother.A more advanced solution is that he was resuscitated and remained in a coma for two years. We are introduced to a character who has been waiting for a heart transplant. In 2002 when our waking hero visits this guy he sees a comatose patient in the same room. That is he ready to donate his heart. We then see our hero kill this recipient patient by stabbing in the heart both in 2000 and 2002. Our hero finds himself on an elevator with an orderly and a covered body the recipient and the orderly says this never happens.So a more advanced solution is that the two years is spent in constantly revisiting and reliving the movie inside during the two years of coma. When the transplant actually happens our hero sabotages it to put himself out of misery.An even more advanced solution is the one I prefer. For background you need to know some tradition about the untrusted narrator. Usually you know who the narrator is but later you discover that they cannot be trusted. The Others is a good example. What's much more interesting is when you discover not only that the narrator cannot be trusted but neither can your knowledge of who that narrator is. The advanced solutions to Identity and Primer are of this type.So its cool if you consider this other solution. Our hero in fact died in the accident. When he visits the morgue there are three bodies there. His heart went to the recipient we know and has prompted two years of haunting in that body and mind. So the narrator whose visions we see are in fact the guy with the new heart. Shades of Return to Me.In this case when we see our hero strapped in an MRI machine it is actually the heart recipient Travitt who blurs with the orderly Travis who tells our guy he will take him on a journey. And that guy is threatened by a masked man who actually is our hero Simon.I prefer this solution. You might as well. Oh and it has Sarah Polley as the cause of the whole disaster.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

He doesn't recognize his evil wife played deliciously by Piper Perabo or his alleged mistress the lovely but miscast Sarah Polley. He soon suspects that someone in the hospital is trying to kill himand then finds himself in the same hospital two years earlier with the ability to bounce back and forth between the two time periods.Although it sounds like something that has been done many times recently the first half of this movie is actually suspenseful and engaging. Unfortunately with a plot twist the movie goes downhill about halfway through. While the movie will keep you thinking for a while afterwards it is ultimately forgettable because it is way too typical of the current crop of scifi memory thrillers. Perabo is great hereshe gets to play a shy mousy nurse in 2000 and then a malicious blackmailing wealthy woman in 2002. Sarah Polley is one of the best actresses of her generation and I'm not sure why she's in this movie. Phillipe delivers the expected humdrum performance.My Rating 610".

His doctor is worried about him for reasons that he doesn't specify very well to Simon but Simon seems okay. At least until Dr. Newman asks him the date. Simon has to look outside his hospital window to even see what season it is and he says that the year is 2000. It's really 2002. Somehow he lost two years that he cannot remember. Worse two different women seem to appear as his wife. The more he tries to figure out what happened the more of a living nightmare it becomes. Is he losing his mind? The I Inside has him trying to remember his past solve a number of mysteries and figure out what is really going on.That a film like The I Inside has an American release on the Starz! Mystery channel and not until January 2005 while a film like Alone in the Dark 2005 has a major multiplex release across the country makes as much sense as leaving the Ferrari at home and cruising the strip on a tricycle instead in an attempt to impress the chicks. Even though it has clear stylistic and thematic precursors The I Inside is a gem of a film that should have had a theatrical release at an earlier date. It ended up as a 10 out of 10 for me.In a film like this you can't say much about the plot without providing spoilers. To give you an idea of what the film is like though it would be sufficient to cite the other works that the I Inside cast and crew have mentioned as influencesThe Sixth Sense 1999 The Others 2001 Donnie Darko 2001 Memento 2000 and perhaps most significantly Jacob's Ladder 1990. There are also a number of similarities to The Butterfly Effect 2004. But as The I Inside and that film were actually completed at about the same time it seems like another of those toonumerousforcoincidence eras when there was something in the air that led to a number of similar films. It's not that the films are copying from one another so much as that they share influences ranging from precursor films to concurrent societal concerns and even scripts that are being shopped around.The structure of The I Inside is complex from the start and increases in complexity as the film plays out. That director Roland Suso Richter is able to keep it as coherent as he does is a remarkable testament to his skill. Phillippe is in almost every shot of the film as by necessity we have to see the film as his character does to piece it together with him. This is the best performance I have ever seen from him and he's usually good. He has an ability here to turn on a dime and provide a believable character who gradually comes to a realization as he bounces back and forth between temporal settings. It's even more complicated than that as when he's playing the character in the previous temporal setting he has to be two characters at oncethe character as he was when that temporal setting initially occurred and the character from the later temporal setting experiencing it again as a voyeur while piecing together the puzzle.Richter also manages an eerie mood of displacement throughout the film. This puts the viewer in a frame of mind similar to Phillippe's character helping the viewer feel the disorientation and encroaching paranoia and madness along with the character. It works marvelously. It's also worth briefly mentioning the fantastic music by Nicholas Pike as it does much to enhance the mood.The I Inside is the perfect example of why originality isn't the most important criterion for a good film. Although it wears its influences on its sleeve or its hospital gown in this case this is one of the best films ever made in this horror subgenre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is a film that will keep you wondering just what it's all about. For those who are into such movies you're in for a treat. The familiar theme of going back to the past to fix certain wrongs is offered here with an engaging plot and a bangup twist.Simon Cable is a wealthy young man who wakes up in a hospital after some kind of accident in 2002 supposedly due to wood refinishing fumes. We soon learn that he has been in this hospital before in 2000 which is when his brother Peter was killed. His wife Anna comes to see him but apparently was somehow involved in the coverup of the truth behind Peter's death. All of this is unknown to Simon since he has amnesia or so his doctor thinks and now believes he has lost two years of his life. It is here that we moviegoers become intrigued and the attentiongrabbing twists do not stop. Who is the blond woman Claire? What is the secret of Simon's brother's death? Why is his doctor unfathomably a pediatrician?As Simon recovers from his accident he seems to have flashbacks to 2000 filling the holes in his memory. Or does he? His doctor in 2000 makes a pretty good case that his mind is creating images that Simon feels are actually premonitions of 2002. Confused? Well so's Simon and we come to understand the real story in bits and pieces just as Simon does. Eventually he believes based on a rather shocking incident during a flashback to 2000 that he can go back in time to undo past wrongs and as in so many other films of this type things do not go well.Seen it before you say? Well this is a wellwrought presentation of the basic premise with a possible murder and wifemistress conflict some good editing and more than respectable acting especially from Ryan Phillipe Simon who seems to be blossoming as an actor or at least is getting better roles. This is a good thing considering that Phillipe is in every scene and the other actors all have rather small parts by comparison. Bigname actor Stephen Rea as Doctor Newman is nothing to write home about but that may partly be because his role is relatively less significant to the total story. The role of Simon's brother Peter played by Robert Sean Leonard is even smaller and Leonard seems to barely walk through it. However watch for Stephen Graham's portrayal of particularly crabby heart patient Travitt in the year 2000 scenes.In any event go into this film with an open mind and try not to compare it to others of its genre most recently The Butterfly Effect. The last few minutes of the film will make you rethink your comparisons anyway and leave you with a new confusion worth discussing at your favorite coffeehouse afterwards.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not possible spoilers MAJOR spoilers you can rest assured... I'm writing this review because reading the other comments I think this movie is being misunderstood by many people. Many people give it a low rating because of the ending which they see as a kind of cheap way to solve the riddle.But actually I think the ending is not a solution to a riddle. The fact that Simon the main protagonist is dead at the end of the movie is not a clue to the story it's rather the RESULT of the different choices he makes while timetravelling to the past.What I want to say is according to me the timetravelling is not some fantasy by someone in a coma or someone in the process of dying. It is REAL in the fantasy world of the movie. Simon starts out in hospital in 2002 being a victim presumably of inhaling poisonous fumes while working in the house but it is also suggested that this might be a poisoning attempt by his wife Anna. He lost his memory but for some inexplicable reason gets caught in a continuous timetravel between 2000 and 2002. The significant thing is that he was in the same hospital in 2000 after the rather unintentional murder on his brother and the car crash he got involved in together with his nearly dead brother presumably while on the way to the hospital. Because of the car accident he was able to cover up the murder but got blackmailed by Anna his future wife who is after his money.At least that's what we are told to believe.None of the facts in this movie are unconditional fact namely. Almost anything that happened could have happened in a different way if the protagonist would have made different choices while travelling to the past. I'm going to give a few examples of that.1. The road to the cliff vs. the road to the hospital As we can see originally Simon takes the road to the cliff after his brother's death well neardeath. He clearly intends to throw his body down the cliff to simulate a suicide. However his plan fails because some other car is there with a couple making love. After a long time he decides to turn back. But it's not clear to what place. His house? The hospital? Has Claire already returned to the house and found the mess that is there or not? Anyway when he had a bad intention Simon chose the wrong road because it eventually led to him getting involved in a car crash and Anna blackmailing him. When he had a good intention when revisiting the past and trying to change things around Simon chose the good road the one to the hospital. And this turns out to be fatal since he gets involved in a car crash with Claire who is the classical blonde haired female character representing the good and dies just like everybody else.I think a strong suggestion is being made here that it doesn't really matter which road you take the wrong one or the good one since either everything is predetermined OR the real wrong the murder has already taken place.2. The unanswered phone call We see the struggle between Simon and his brother Peter twice. The first time Simon who is warped back to the past sees himself getting involved in a struggle with his brother which leads to Peter's unfortunate death. The second time he is the protagonist himself and tries to prevent Peter's death but unfortunately causing the exact same event to happen. Twice we can hear an unanswered phone ringing. This is one of those points in the movie where you know that Simon made a bad choice. I guess this phonecall is supposed to be from Claire who has just left the house and is calling that she is on her way back.Actually the fact that no one answers the phone in both cases might be exactly the reason why the fateful car crash appears in both scenarios although in one of the scenarios Simon survives and in the other he doesn't Claire decides to return because she is getting worried about Simon andor Peter.Anyway there are a lot more intriguing things in this movie that I cannot even discuss here. I'm giving it a 10 nonetheless not because I think it is worth a 10 I would give it a 7 or 8 or so but because I find the general ratings given here ridiculously low There's more to rating movies than only giving a 1 or a 10 people....This is a haunting movie with a really nice twisted plot a lot of suspense especially in the first part of the movie overall decent acting I thought the character of Anna and the guy waiting for a heart transplantation were done especially well but rather uninspired music although the sound effects are nicely done. I suspect that the fact that this movie was hardly ever promoted in the USA has more to do with the lack of appreciation here than anything else.".

I'm giving it a 10 nonetheless not because I think it is worth a 10 I would give it a 7 or 8 or so but because I find the general ratings given here ridiculously low There's more to rating movies than only giving a 1 or a 10 people....This is a haunting movie with a really nice twisted plot a lot of suspense especially in the first part of the movie overall decent acting I thought the character of Anna and the guy waiting for a heart transplantation were done especially well but rather uninspired music although the sound effects are nicely done. I suspect that the fact that this movie was hardly ever promoted in the USA has more to do with the lack of appreciation here than anything else.";

	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely hated The I Inside for numerous reasons one being how poorly executed it was as well as confusing but the main reason why I thought this movie was utter garbage and worth a mere 2 stars was the fact that once the ending reveals the truth behind the madness of the film it is quite clear that the majority of the plot and movie was contrived and pointless.The ending of the film brings the realization that Simon Cable Phillipe died along with his brother and his brother's fianc Claire in a car accident in 2000 and because he can simply not accept what happened and feels responsible for the other deaths he keeps going back in time in his mind to try and change what happened and save them. The problem? If a character wants to change the events that lead to a deadly accident in 2000 common sense says that the character should awake in the year 2000 right before the accident and well try to change what happened. Such a concept was too simple for The I Inside so they concocted a completely pointless plot where the character of Simon wakes up in the year 2002 after supposedly being poisoned by his wife Anna and has no memory of the last 2 years. Simon is told that his brother died in a car accident in 2000 but he survived. The movie amps up the mystery and intrigue when Simon while wandering around the hospital somehow finds himself entering the year 2000. He will be walking down the hallway in 2002 and then turn a corner and enter for example the lounge and instead of it being 2002 he's back in 2000 in the same hospital. The movie continually shifts from the year 2002 to the year 2000 and back again in the hospital while simultaneously having Simon return to his home in the year 2000 to try and change events that led to the car accident that in his mind only killed his brother. The movie also adds the idea that whatever happens to people in the year 2000 will happen to them in 2002 which adds more mystery to the plot. For example in the year 2000 in the hospital Simon ends up hallucinating and stabbing someone to death someone who he saw alive in the hospital in the year 2002 only for that person to then die spontaneously and start bleeding out everywhere in the year 2002. So... why is the movie so bad? Simple  because NONE of that meant anything to the actual plot once all is revealed at the end. The entire 'time traveling' between the years 2002 and 2000 having things happen to people in 2000 and then have it show up in 2002 was in the end pointless and had NOTHING to do with the actual plot of Simon not accepting his death from the car accident in 2000 and wanting to go back in time to try and change the outcome. There is no reason at all why he couldn't have just woken up in 2000. The entire 2002 subplot is 100 percent bullshit and it's that subplot that was the only thing that made the film somewhat mysterious. As for the answer of why the year 2002 the movie tries to justify that entire plot by making Simon's time of death in 2000 at 2002 as if that is why he keeps waking up 2 years after the accident and then has to shift between the years 2002 and 2000 but it's weak at best. Clearly the writers came up with the time traveling concept first and then tagged on that his death was at 2002 to try and make it not seem contrived and ridiculous that he was randomly waking up 2 years after the accident to try and change events that occurred right before the accident. Failure.As for my explanation for what happened in the film there is no doubt that Simon was killed in 2000 and everything in 2002 is an illusion. What solidified it for me was the fact that his father was his doctor in 2002 and the puzzle he was putting together in the lobby turned out to be of a photo of him his brother and his father that we see at the end at the brother's house.2 stars  the actual movie is confusing poorly directed and poorly edited and once you find out that the entire 2002 time traveling to the year 2000 was completely unnecessary and just a stunt to try and make the film interesting it's hard to not see it as complete rubbish.".

With a lot a lot of delay The I Inside has arrived to our cinema theaters.What on earth went wrong here? I can do some research and find the answer although if isn't worth the space of my page. Roland Suso Richter a German director came to try in Hollywood and directed this picture. He's too stylish for what the viewer is used to see. He invents too much and ends up confusing him although that's in part fault of the screenplay. What happened to him? He is directing TV in Germany and Hollywood hasn't looked for him in three years.Writer Michael CooneyIs this the same guy that wrote Identity? Is it possible for him to write such a mess as The I Inside? Apparently it is and if you want to save him you could forgive him because the screenplay was adapted from his own play and as I have said before a play can be good but it doesn't have to make a good movie. Joined by Timothy Scott Bogart Cooney takes you inside the world of a man who is able to change the future by changing the past.I mean of course the material they had in their hands was interesting it could have created a cult classic or something everyone would have talked about. But that's not how it went down and if you try to understand the film you will get to the bottom of it. There is an explanation but you're so tired by the time it arrives that you don't want to figure out anything.Tiring is one of the best words to define The I Inside and it is impossible not to compare it with The Butterfly Effect a film where you don't want to get to the end. You've got to compare then because the first one sucks and the latter one is great because the cast of the first one is way superior to the latter one's I like Ryan Phillippe is a starring role I liked Cruel Intentions and very much liked Antitrust. But how can an actor like him not carry a film like this one? How can Ashton Kutcher do it better? Sarah Polley is much more talented than Amy Smart but the same situation occurred. And Robert Sean Leonard he is better than the whole 'Butterfly' cast put togetherAnd Stephen Rea he is an Oscar Nominated actor please! You can also find Piper Perabo in The I Inside but I doubt you'll be interested after all I've said. Forgive me if I'm to harsh but there are few movies as bad as this oneIt's the truth.".

Simon Ryan Phillippe wakes up in a hospital with no memory of how he got there and no memory of the last two years of his life. Early on he meets Claire whom he doesn't remember and Anna a wife he doesn't know he had. Simon is also not aware his brother Peter is dead. The last thing Simon remembers is that he went to see his brother in 2000 and that he had an auto accident that evening.Thus begins a tale of past and present as Simon relives the experiences of 2000 and 2002 discovering along the way he can change change past and present.Some have compared this to Memento but the story is really closer in spirit to an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode titled Shadow Play and the play Steambath with touches of Mulholland Drive and The Sixth Sense though lacking the emotional wallop or terror of the others. Nonetheless The I Inside is a great psychological suspense film and I highly recommend it.WARNING SPOILERSSome seem confused about the nature of Mr. Travati Simon's wisecracking hospital roommate and the reason for the 2002. Simon saw Mr. Travati walking down the passageway of the hospital hooked to an IV bottle when he was brought after the car accident. Simon is DEAD and his conscious integrated Travati Anna and the emergency room doctors into his illusion in order to give cohesiveness to the illusion that he was still alive and experiencing time travel. The 2002 was actually 2002 military time 802 PM when the emergency room doctor called Simon's death.END OF SPOILERSThis movie was released directly to cable where fortunately there should be a big audience for it. I predict The I Inside will become a cult film and is certainly worthy of a 9.".

The scenery and story surrounding the film were both intriguing despite the film's low budget the director did an excellent job of constructing the devastated planet.  Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin turned in excellent performances and the supporting cast was also quite good.  Finally every scene is shot with a real urgency to it particularly well done are the nightmarish confrontation 23 of the way through the movie and the poignant and shattering ending.  In short this is a very very good movie and well worth renting.  It will stay with you for quite a while.Before signing off I should say something about construing one science fiction movie as a ripoff of others.  Screamers had elements of its plot which can be found in other films ie men and machines monsters but it blends them seamlessly into its own original story.  The mere presence of identifiable elements from other films has given people ground to criticize this movie as unoriginal.  By their standards I don't think it would be possible at all to make new movies or novels or anything.  These surface similarities will always be there.  One can argue that the Matrix is merely an update of Socrates' cave allegory.  In conclusion ignore the critics and see Screamers!!".

I had read Phillip K Dick's 'Second Variety' the short story upon which this movie is based before I ever saw Screamers and I didn't realize Screamers was even based on the story until I watched it.  Being a big fan of the original story I was glad to see it brought to the screen and more or less faithfully  I thought Peter Weller did a great job in this movie the atmosphere was actually somewhat as I had imagined it reading the story they updated it somewhat by placing it in a totally different location since the original story's wasteland was a result of nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia something which I'm sure seemed plausible at the time it was written but is a little dated now and although I don't think they pulled off the sort of paranoia we saw in The Thing there was some nice tension as the story unfolded although it fell apart a bit at the end.Bottom line  if you're a sci fi fan sniffing around for some sci fi you haven't seen but don't want to sit through a total dog it's not a bad renter.".

Commander Hendricksson Weller sets out with the lost soldier Jefferson Lauer to contact the other side and declare peace. However what they find will spell the end of their war one way or another.This is based on a Phillip K.

It also has a cynical edge lended by the way that the soldiers have been deserted by their leaders and continue to be tricked into fighting while the leaders get on with their business.Weller is excellent as the world weary commander who finds his life sold out from under him. The supporting cast are OK with their stereotyped characters but the real stars are the Screamers who start out by small things with sawblades and gradually take other forms. The child versions of Screamers are particularly creepy and perhaps a little disturbing.However this is not as terrifying as it should be nor is it as intelligent as it starts out being.  The whole issue behind the different screamers is not explained and towards the end they just keep popping up without reason! It also has one of those watch out for the sequel style endings  although in fairness it isn't quite as bad as that.  The special effects are a bit ropey but do the job  after all this is a very low budget movie.The whole thing is not as good as it could have been but is certainly head and shoulders above a lot of low budget scifi thrillers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Screamers is a futuristic SciFi Horror set on another planet Sirius 6B. The film starts off very poorly with a narrative spoken in a robotic voice indicating that Screamers will be no more than Zgrade garbage. Luckily Screamers proves to be a respectable suspense filled film that superbly displays the extremes of raw human emotions.Screamers always has the advantage that it was written by Philip K. Dick the author whose stories lead to Blade Runner Total Recall and Minority Report. Whilst Screamers is no way in the same league as these films it is much more thought provoking and gripping than other SciFi films on a similar budget. The pace at which the plot moves is extremely intense it seizes the attention of the audience and leaves them waiting for the next scene. The relationships between each character are all very compelling every character has their own little story which ensures Screamers does not become one dimensional.Peter Weller is excellent in his role as Hendrickson. I've only seen him in Robocop so it is good to know he is not simply good at playing a robot. His character is complex as he misses earth yet has submitted to being stuck on Sirius 6B. His relationship with Jessica Jennifer Rubin develops wonderfully throughout the film and is a good contrast to the horror taking place. Jennifer Rubin also puts on a great performance as her character starts as a mystery and gradually opens up in to someone the audience really cares for.The Screamers are a tremendous idea as underground defence robots who adapt to produce a new human looking batch of screamers. The sound they make is very chilling and really brings up the hairs on the back of your neck this is greatly reflected in the characters reactions on hearing the screams. Sadly poor stop motion effects mean it is a disappointment when it comes to seeing the screamers attack but it is not hard to overlook special effects for a good story.It is a shame Screamers wasn't given more budget as it had potential to be a truly great film. I don't care about special effects very much but I feel the films vision could have been realised more if there was more money in this area. Also some of the sets are poorly designed as there appears to be a lack of effort in some places. The outlook is supposed to be bleak but the director does little to emphasise this.Possibly the best thing about Screamers is the end. With paranoia levels reaching those in The Thing the twist at the end is very surprising and tense. Weller and Rubin really shine in these scenes and do well to affect the audience's emotions. The script which is good throughout is also especially good in the final sequence.With more money behind it and better direction Screamers would be a SciFi classic as it is Screamers is an underrated well acted great story.".

The thing about movies today is that not many have a good solid idea it's just not original enough. Here though i thought they had at least a decent concept and tried to capitalize on that.On a distant world a war has raged for many years. One side however have developed a weapon capable of winning the conflict. It's a weapon called Screamers small machines that hunt down and kill anyone not wearing a special bracelet identifying them as friendlies. The problem is that the weapon has now developed itself further and is no longer capable of separating friend from foe...In the halfasleep state of mind that i was when i started watching the movie i thought the idea of these weapons was rather interesting. And even when i had become more or less awake that thought stayed with me. Peter Weller is as usual decent enough in the lead. I can't say he's my favorite actor by far but he always keeps a certain dignity in his performance. The rest of the actors left rather much to wish for though.The special effects feel dated when watched today but they are not too bad. Considering that this is not a highbudget movie they were sufficient. What really carries the movie though is the story and the surprises throughout. A sappy ending lowers the grade a notch but this is still worth watching in my opinion. I rate it 510.".

Blood is cheaper than raw materials  this is also reflecting the main principles of our life today.In my opinion you mustn't have one million explosions or worldfamous stars in a movie to make it good.

	schema:reviewBody "Screamers is like one of those madeforHBO science fiction programmers from the mid 90s except that there's some brighter things going for it. One of these is that it's based on a short story by one of the hallmark authors of science fiction Philip K Dick and another is that the script mostly got work done and seems most noticeable by Dan O'Bannon writer behind Alien and Return of the Living Dead. There's more weight in levels of irony not always the uproarious variety but more nuanced and violent more in putting some good twists to the clichs that are taken for granted in stories set in desolate futuristic environments the discovery of a cute abandoned child the devilish nature of the 'screamers' themselves and how their more advanced counterparts work the personalities of the crew that Peter Weller's character discovers at the base and how each member soon diesgets killed off. This might also be attributable to O'Bannon who tackled this in his previous successes in films but to say who is totally responsible for what can only be said for those who've read Dick's story Second Variety which I have not. However it should be said if only on some level of understanding from reading past works of his it feels like it has a level of faith to the source albeit changing locations and certain details in the situations by being approximately cynical to the characters.The only problem then comes in with it being directed more or less as a standard slightlyhigherinquality made for TV movie. It's by no means a scifi channel movie of the week however Screamers might have fared a little better with its challenging and darkly funny bits without director Christian Duguay who is professional enough to make it watchable on such a low budget low for how it looks anyway but doesn't give certain scenes enough juice to really fly past where it stays at being average. The cast too is a little more of the regular variety with isn't totally a bad thing by having character actors Blevel character actors if that it helps add to the levels of slight subversion in this story they're in about technology gone to the dogs on a snow planet in 2078. I liked seeing actors cast to type like Andrew Lauer as the 'kid' who's got enough experience as a soldier but is still pretty naive in other ways Roy Dupis in a sublimely duplicitous role Jennifer Rubin as the token tough girl. Even Weller has his right place in the framework not too cocky a hero but with enough confidence to carry a picture without the Robocop gear. I even enjoyed some of the action setpieces with one especially involving a whole field of Davids the little robot boy.There's also a slight issue that has to be contended which is too many 'gotcha' addendums to the climax. It's not enough that one character suddenly appears as another cyborg but that there's another and then another...and then finally one last wink in the final shot which actually does work as a creepy last bit and it's detracting from what is attempting to be a little more substantial. It's only when the hints of things not staying all happyintheend do the director and actors really hit good ground. Screamers has more than its share of moments and it will continue to be an underrated find by scifi fans as the years go by. That it's nowhere near the best of Dick's adaptations and not the worst is understandable. 6.510".

One of the more subversive scenes has an army of screamers in disguise as young boys being shot down by the good guys. Peter Weller of ROBOCOP fame stars and he was at the top of his game when he made this. The only thing holding this picture back is the budget which must have been minuscule.

	schema:reviewBody "I must confess the trailer for this film was not impressive.  However the look of the film aesthetically was very impressive.  What grabbed my attention were the locations and the actor's costumes.  I saw vast desolated landscapes as the backdrop for this scifi picture and that really attracted me.  I am a fan of Science Fiction so I rented it.  And I really enjoyed this movie.First off it stars Peter Weller.  I really enjoy this actor and am very disappointed that we do not see much of him these days.  The only real roles I choose to remember him as are Alex J Murphy in the 1987 Verhoeven classic ROBOCOP and Bill Lee in Cronenberg's 1991 NAKED LUNCH.SCREAMERS is basically a futuristic blend of THE TERMINATOR 1984 and TREMORS 1990.  The film is about an alien world dead of life except for two fighting human armies.  A specific weapon called screamers were designed for warfare.  These small bladelike killing machines attack from beneath you exploding upward from the ground.  With a quick slice of horror victims are left missing a limb...or two.  Soon enough the machines grow smarter and modify themselves.  Let's just say all hell breaks loose.The movie has a good blend of the scifi and horrorsuspense elements needed for a good movie and the FX aren't bad.  The story never falters there are even a lot of scaressurprises and all the actors give good performances. Also upon watching this movie I noticed many impressive credits that I should share with you.  First off the film is based on a short story by Philip K Dick other films inspired by his shorts are 1982's BLADE RUNNER and 1990's TOTAL RECALL.  The screenplay is cowritten by Dan O'Bannon whose writing credits include 1979's ALIEN and 1981's HEAVY METAL.  And of course SCREAMERS stars Peter Weller RoboCop himself. Another great Science Fiction movie.SIDE NOTE is it just me or does Peter Weller frightenly resemble Bauhaus vocalist Peter Murphy?  And check this out Peter Weller plays Alex Murphy in ROBOCOP.  Put the two names together and you have Peter Murphy  ??!?!?!?!?!?!!?Anyway back to SCREAMERS.  In a nutshell if you love Science Fiction or even like it then I highly recommend this movie.  It is worth your time.".

Lance Henrickson in something watchable for a change as a basement dwelling bum the deliciously sexy Deborah Kara Unger play the main character Jeremy Sisto's Six Feet Under Wrong Turn love interest.This film actually kept me guessing until the end.

It's an outstanding achievement and although it only made the indie festivals and not the big screen my old saying applies The stuff that usually makes it to big screens is crap I don't have any desire to see anyway.PARANOIA 1.0 is a moody shadowy thoughtprovoking modern fable that Aesop himself would have been proud to say he conjured up if he was living in our day. Like his stories this one has a moral to it a lesson about corporate greed corruption and manipulation.Simon J Jeremy Sisto is a hacker who works for one of the big corporations. Like Angela Bennett of THE NET he lives alone and isolated and prefers the safety of home to getting out and being in the world. The only time he does go out is to buy Nature Fresh Milk from the store nearby and he consumes it by the quarts. His boss is mad at him because he isn't meeting deadlines and his landlord is threatening to evict him.His dimly lit apartment building is occupied by people who are stranger than him A pornographergame programmer Bruce Payne an eccentric Udo Kier who is building his first child a singing handyman Lance Henriksen and a cancer nurse Debra Kara Ungerwho sees so much death and suffering on the job that she's on the verge of burnout.I don't want to reveal a lot of the plot. It's very rewarding to find that out for yourself. Suffice it to say that it has lots of twists and the outcome will surprise you. Another IMDb user described this film as without a hero but I found myself hard pressed not to call a certain character a hero when the end came.Visually the film is very beautiful with a sumptuous color palette in addition to many dark sequences.Sisto's acting performance is beautiful in this film especially in scenes where Simon is terrorized by the things happening in and around him. His emotion with the character Trish is amazing to watch.For a refreshing side trip away from the mainstream stuff I highly recommend 1.0. 10 out of 10 stars!!!".

The music and sounds of the movie are excellent together with the grittiness of the closeups the camera angles the dark environments and over saturated colors the directors successfully convey the paranoid schizophrenic mood of the movie onto it's viewers.The acting was convincing and most of the characters were very interesting and well cast.Contrary to previous comments this movie does indeed have a plot and a great one at that. Granted if you're not technically inclined or have a short attention span you may not get what's happening or just fail to see the plot entirely. So this movie is not for everyone but then again what movie is? Most male geeks aged 2030 will like One Point 0.The movie progresses at a steady pace slowly giving the audience more information. At any point in the movie save for the ending the audience only knows as much as the main character knows. Some of the information conflicts leading to assumptions and more questionsis it a video game? is it a conspiracy? is he insane? but this only reflects the confusion the main character is feeling. I feel I should write more about this movie but everything I have to say seems to be speculation spoiler or discussion. To sum up my review One Point O is an awesome piece of environmentalpsychological science fiction. The movie will keep you guessing while you're watching it and will leave you with questions when it's over.".

The Romanian locations do for Paranoia some of what the Yugoslavian locations did for the Trial. Paranoia gives a cyberpunk angle on the Kafkaesque theme of the internalization of social structure particularly the mentality of consumerism. Although Kafka did not explicitly address consumerism I think he might if he was alive and writing in the 21st century. The subthemes of sexual guilt and infection are very much from Kafka. And the police are especially Kafkaesque. I also detected the influence of David Cronenberg especially his mediarelated films Videodrome and eXistenZ. I think there was also a little bit of Kubrick influence. I saw this in the neighbor's AI project which sort of a existential postmodern frankensteinian Edvard Munchian version of 2001's Hal and AI's David. He goes Aaahhhhh ...

He never quite gets it finished and after continued threats of termination is finally fired. This is the least of his worries.Every so often he runs out to the store for milk and other items. He doesn't buy all that much but the prices in whatever undefined currency keep on going up. Twentyone fifty two Thirtytwo fiftytwo Eightyseven fiftyseven.Simon seems to have a thing for milk  another resident is big on Kola 500  and the building super is wellstocked on Farm Cut meat. Why these monomanias which nobody seems to recognize as such? And what's with all these empty packages arriving anonymously at Simon's?There seem to be little bits and pieces peeking out from other science fiction works throughout the filmYou're in the game  do you want to lead or do you want to follow? sounds like eXistenZI can show you things  shades of Roy Batty's comment to the ocular genetic engineer in Blade Runner If you could see what I've seen with your eyesthe vision box seemed somewhat similar to the Mercer box in PKD's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?the premise of Frederick Pohl's The Tunnel Under the World Alternating Currents seems to feed into the food monomanias.There's a bit of the tension between there's nothing new under the sun by the writer of Ecclesiastes and Goethe's everything has been thought of before the trouble is to think of it again  throughout the film. I kept wondering if and hoping that the film would become more than the sum of its parts.It had its moments of dry humor  What happened to your couch? I thought it cleaned itself?It's broken.No matter how sophisticated technology gets there'll always be a need for repair  no doubt increasing with the complexity of the system.Detectives stop by to see Simon  he tries to avoid them. He gets the phone call termination Simon J.? You're fired. Simon tries to explain the difficulties he's been dealing with  the reasons his work's been delayed. What's this project all about anyway?We only work on a specific part  we don't know the big picture.Perhaps a few more viewings will put more pieces together.".

He never quite gets it finished and after continued threats of termination is finally fired. This is the least of his worries.Every so often he runs out to the store for milk and other items. He doesn't buy all that much but the prices in whatever undefined currency keep on going up. Twentyone fifty two Thirtytwo fiftytwo Eightyseven fiftyseven.Simon seems to have a thing for milk  another resident is big on Kola 500  and the building super is wellstocked on Farm Cut meat. Why these monomanias which nobody seems to recognize as such? And what's with all these empty packages arriving anonymously at Simon's?There seem to be little bits and pieces peeking out from other science fiction works throughout the filmYou're in the game  do you want to lead or do you want to follow? sounds like eXistenZI can show you things  shades of Roy Batty's comment to the ocular genetic engineer in Blade Runner If you could see what I've seen with your eyesthe vision box seemed somewhat similar to the Mercer box in PKD's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?the premise of Frederick Pohl's The Tunnel Under the World Alternating Currents seems to feed into the food monomanias.There's a bit of the tension between there's nothing new under the sun by the writer of Ecclesiastes and Goethe's everything has been thought of before the trouble is to think of it again  throughout the film. I kept wondering if and hoping that the film would become more than the sum of its parts.It had its moments of dry humor  What happened to your couch? I thought it cleaned itself?It's broken.No matter how sophisticated technology gets there'll always be a need for repair  no doubt increasing with the complexity of the system.Detectives stop by to see Simon  he tries to avoid them. He gets the phone call termination Simon J.? You're fired. Simon tries to explain the difficulties he's been dealing with  the reasons his work's been delayed. What's this project all about anyway?We only work on a specific part  we don't know the big picture.Perhaps a few more viewings will put more pieces together.";

While kids will definitely enjoy this Christmasthemed saga adults will find a deeper level of depth than they may remember from seeing the film at a younger age.The movie strikes a sharp contrast between the exaggerated polysyllabic narration of Ralphie filled with nostalgia and lucid memories and the soft highpitched childlike wonder of Ralphie's spoken word.  The narrator is clearly not the same character as the one portrayed on film but a character wholly outside the story reliving his childhood emotions and anecdotes.  Yet he is the heart of the film the true center of gravity. This is because the movie is not about a scary Santa Clause and a BB gun  it's about childhood memories and the feelings they evoke.  To that end A Christmas Story is flawless.A Christmas Story tells of the epically materialistic journey of Ralphie Peter Billingsley as he searches for the golden upheld idol of all redblooded American boys  A Red Rider Air Rifle.  Ralphie spins an intricate web of cunning and deceit as he plots to get his hands on it  including an essay a trip to Santa Claus and more.  The movie also shows us a glimpse of his family  his irritable foulmouthed father with a good heart his whiny brother Randy and his sweet allAmerican mother.  It is not so much a continuous story as a series of vignettes but it ultimately serves the movie's purpose.This is a funny film.  The narration by Jean Shepherd is filled with love for this story.  He absolutely captures the emotions and logic of childhood. In a subtle but amusing moment Shepherd intones the incomparably eloquent pouring forth of thought into writing  only to have Billingsley note in his awefilled highpitched voice that I think everyone should have a Red Rider BB gun.  It's very good for Christmas. paraphrased.  Most of the humor is similar  the natural exaggeration of a child as expressed by Shepherd's consistent string of hyperbole.Also there's a reason why it's played constantly on cable TV throughout the Christmas season  it's a movie everyone can relate to.  There are moments of such pure truth here that few can deny their power.  I'm sure that there is a scientific law left unwritten that determines that every kid must at some point fantasize about his parents feeling absolutely terrible and forever regretting some unutterable punishment they inflicted on their child  in this case the immortal washing of a mouth out with soap.Obviously A Christmas Story is not a film that can be compared to Casablanca or Citizen Kane.  It simply excels at its simple goals and comes together as an extraordinarily entertaining piece of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Christmas Story touches my heart as does no other film and I know the reason for this is because it reminds me so much of my own 1950's boyhood. For sure it strikes a nerve in persons of my generation. This is Bob Clark's masterpiece and I know I am not the only person who feels this way. I am going to assume that if you are reading this chances are you have seen the film indeed probably have seen it countless times as I have. This is not a film review in the normal sense. It is more a reminiscence and appreciation of a great story captured for all time in moving pictures which in turn captured the essence of the time and place of its setting that time and setting being a typical town in Indiana during Christmas season in the 1940s as we observe a typical family the Parkers with two young sons named Ralphie and Randy. Most of us over the age of 50 can relate very well to the story's key elements. I recall vividly family outings to crowded downtown sidewalks Mom and Dad squeezing in a season's worth of shopping in one day and doing it under the nose of one who had a visit to Santa Claus on his mind. Staring at the prominent HIGBEES sign in the downtown square I could almost see the words John A. Brown in its place. Browns was the main department store in my hometown of Oklahoma City and the place where I would make my annual visit with Santa Claus.I am sure most who have seen the film realize this is Ralphie's story but Melinda Dillon as the typical 1940's stayathome mom and Darren McGavin as the grumpy but kindly father made the story work. The stove in the Parker's kitchen reminds much of the one my grandmother had and the rest of the house reminded me of the home my other grandparents lived in. As you see viewing A Christmas Story is always a magical experience for me. It is almost as if Mr. Clark made this film with Tom Fowler in mind. There are so many comments to make. It will be impossible to relate them all in a short review but here are some that I know people my age will be most familiar withBeautiful toys displayed in department store windows. The agonizingly long wait for toys ordered via mail and learning too late they are not quite what was expected. The excitement of buying a Christmas tree the joy of setting it up and how much bigger Christmas trees seemed then. Neighborhood bullies who were not nearly as tough as they seemed. Ralphie wanting a BB gun more than life itself. Mom covering trouble for Ralphie to his dad and the same mom making him eat soap for uttering words  learned from Dad. Randy sitting underneath the kitchen sink when depressed. A panicky visit to a tired Santa. An unwanted gift from a wellmeaning aunt. The furious unwrapping of gifts on Christmas morning. I could go on and on. I will make two more observations and then will sign off and let somebody else speak.In the film's sweetest scene we see Dad coming through for his son at the last possible moment. To see the look on young Ralphie's ably played by Peter Billingsley face as he unwraps his best and last gift is one of filmdom's true golden moments. But for me the best moment was the last. Ralphie is in bed at film's end. We see snow outside and Ralphie dreaming of his wonderful gift as the story's author and narrator Jean Shepherd speaking as the grown up Ralphie realizes this was the best Christmas he ever had or ever would have.If you are middle age or older and have not seen A Christmas Story you are perhaps unaware that you have cheated yourself. Buy or rent the 2003 20th anniversary DVD. It will be the best money you spend this Christmas  or any Christmas.".

	schema:reviewBody "I lived the life of Ralphie!  Even though I'm a girl and was born in the late seventies my Christmases were much the same as Ralphie's. From playing Santa on Christmas morning to sipping my Dad's Christmas cocktail to visiting Santa at the department store I lived the very same Christmas memories.  This movie brings out the true essence of Christmas happiness.  Everyone young and old can relive the magic of being a child.Ralphie's vibrant imagination and inventiveness in his ploys to seduce his parents into buying him the ultimate gift are pinchhischubbycheeks adorable.  And Randy...need I say anything??  He is the perfect picture of the baby brother!This movie is universal in its appeal to audiences of all ages race and nationalities.  My husband who grew up in Lebanon and who's first language is Arabic even knew the famous oh fudge line when I first played this movie for him here in the States.I get giddy every time I sit down to watch this movie.  Curling up with a warm cup of cider in front of the fireplace wrapping Christmas presents making Christmas cookies or writing a letter to Santa Claus...those are all perfect times to watch this classic family film.  This has been and always will be my alltime favorite Christmas film.".

From playing Santa on Christmas morning to sipping my Dad's Christmas cocktail to visiting Santa at the department store I lived the very same Christmas memories.  This movie brings out the true essence of Christmas happiness.  Everyone young and old can relive the magic of being a child.Ralphie's vibrant imagination and inventiveness in his ploys to seduce his parents into buying him the ultimate gift are pinchhischubbycheeks adorable.  And Randy...need I say anything??  He is the perfect picture of the baby brother!This movie is universal in its appeal to audiences of all ages race and nationalities.  My husband who grew up in Lebanon and who's first language is Arabic even knew the famous oh fudge line when I first played this movie for him here in the States.I get giddy every time I sit down to watch this movie.  Curling up with a warm cup of cider in front of the fireplace wrapping Christmas presents making Christmas cookies or writing a letter to Santa Claus...those are all perfect times to watch this classic family film.  This has been and always will be my alltime favorite Christmas film.";

But onto the movie I've watched A Christmas Story since the day I was born it's one of those films you never get sick of because of the simple fact that each year of your life you could relate to it in some way. Each character has these memorable moments and you could say that you've been in the same situation. It's great seeing this movie because it makes us laugh about the silliest moments in our life during the Christmas season.Ralphie is a little boy who just so badly wants a B.B. gun for Christmas it's just his dream. Only one problem it'll shoot his eye out according to the adults around him. We go through Christmas with Ralphie and his family his father who is obsessed with a prize leg lamp he won. His mother who is greatly underappreciated but extremely loving. His brother Randy who is your typical silly and annoying younger brother who makes fun of him. And his friends who are on a constant run from the school bully. But all Ralphie can think about during this hard time in his adolescence is that B.B. gun.A Christmas Story has constant unforgettable scenes like the pink bunny out fit that Ralphie gets as a present from his aunt him saying his first swear in front of his dad Mom and Dad's fight over using the glue on purpose visiting Santa at the mall and of course that great ending that is sure to bring a that is sure to bring a tear to your eye. It's just the perfect Christmas movie that is a BIG recommendation for the season. It has great comedy terrific acting and just the most touching moments you'll ever see in a Christmas movie.1010".

My favorites Ralphie's best friend getting his tongue stuck to a pole when he's dared to lick it Ralphie accidentally swearing in front of his father the bully that threatens Ralphie and his friends every day until Ralphie beats him up in a GREAT scene Ralphie's constant fights with his little brother wonderfully played by Ian Petrella and Billingsley and his brother being terrified by a department store Santa.Also Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin are just great as the parents especially Dillon. She has one uproarious scene where she gets Petrella to eat by imitating a pig! This was totally ignored when it came out in 1983 but has slowly developed a cult following. It's now considered one of the best Christmas movies ever maderight up there with It's a Wonderful Life which was also ignored at its release.A charming wonderful Christmas film. A 10 all the way!".

	schema:reviewBody "A Christmas story is a classic holiday film that is very funny and entertaining. This is a movie that should be viewed by everyone and   can been seen on television during thanksgiving and Christmas time. In most families this film is already a tradition to watch every year and that's because it has a wonderful plot great characters and believable actors. A Christmas Story is about an average middle class family living in a small town in the 1940's. The film contains an average family of a regular husband and wife relationship and two young boys. The eldest of the boys is named Ralphie Peter Billingsley who is the star of the film. All that Ralphie wants is to have a perfect Christmas containing the perfect gift a Red Ryder carbon action BB gun. This is all that Ralphie can think about day and night. When Ralphie has to write a Theme about what he wants for Christmas his teacher replies to him you'll shoot your eye out' which seems to be the only reply to him throughout the whole film.What makes this film so great is the ability to relate to Ralphie with his problems throughout the movie such as wanting that one gift that everyone thinks that you're too young to have and are unable to get. The acting is very convincing and makes you think that this could even be you in the movie. There are some very hilarious parts in this film that also make it very good. This particular scene also contains some very cheesy acting which also makes it funny. Ralphie has a dream about getting his Red Ryder BB gun and saving his family from a bunch of evil villains. In this scene Ralphie is wearing the white sparkly cowboy suit and he shoots down the evil villains and saves the day with his gun in a very unrealistic way.There really wasn't much music that can be commented on in this movie  just that it was the orchestral type of music that was out in the time period  of the 40's. The costumes where great and convincing. I also liked how real they made the 40's look. You actually think it might have been made in that time period which makes the film very authentic.  I would recommend this film to anyone who wants some holiday laughs and some great family time together. I would rate this film a 9 out of ten because it's so memorable.".

His has a little brother and all he wants for Christmas is a BBGun. He wants this more than anything. Before Christmas gets there he has many obstacles to overcome. One of them is getting home!

Many wonderful scenes of boys will be boys trouble including the unforgettable tongue frozen to the flag pole make this movie a delight to watch again and again.As an added bonus there is much authentic Cleveland nostalgia including the old wooden escalators at Higgbees and the main Square in front of Tower City.

Everyone from his mom to his teacher to even Santa Claus himself tell him that he'll shoot his eye out and should not have such a dangerous toy. Many wonderful scenes of boys will be boys trouble including the unforgettable tongue frozen to the flag pole make this movie a delight to watch again and again.As an added bonus there is much authentic Cleveland nostalgia including the old wooden escalators at Higgbees and the main Square in front of Tower City. Add this to your Christmas Classics and place it right next to Miracle on 34th Street and It's A Wonderful Life!";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't just mean bad I mean impressively surprisingly stupendously monumentally horrendously awful.The people who told me this was a Christmas classic... I wonder when the last time they saw it and paid attention was. This movie sits atop a lofty reputation which is all that it has in its favor. What is the case for this being a good film?No character is likable. In any scene when the main character is with one of his friends from school that scene ends with one of them being abandoned by their friends to a horrible fate of some kind alone bullies frozen tongues etc.The younger brother lives under the sink and is only able to eat his food when his mom tells him to act like a pig which he does for a really really long time editing anyone?in disgusting glorious detail. Probably that kid grows up to be a serial killer. Mom pulls little Ralphie off a kid whose nose he has just broken and without waiting to find out what happened leaves the other kid there lying in the snow bleeding. Covered in blood. Really the blood is all over his face.Dad is a more endearing character because he is bumbling and likes to drop the fbomb around his little kids at home while he leaves the parenting to mom. And now I will anticipate a response in the defense but that's how things were. I hope life at the time was better. This movie celebrates mediocrity. The whole goal of it is to connect to Americans because these things really happened to people. There were bullies! There were teachers and GASP pranks! There were trips to the shopping mall! Creepy elves and Santas! Dorky kids who constantly wore repulsive sweaters! Dogs stole the turkey! STOP THE PRESSES. THERE WERE PINK BUNNY SUITS.Is that really funny? No episode or moment of the movie is really any more than mediocre the humor is pedestrian at its best moments and the movie just isn't ever remotely interesting.I didn't know whether to be more disturbed by Ralphie's fantasy about shooting imaginary black people trying to rob his house or by the amusement created by Chinese people trying to speak English perhaps in the end it was the simple fact that all of the terrible stock characters and pedestrian humor and mediocrity and cheesy voiceovers and all the rest of it were structured around a boy's desire to get a gun for Christmas. Which he did.".

It captures what every child feels like at Christmas. The cast is perfect and the film is never dull. What was nice about this film was that it was very respectful of the holiday itself and it showed how all of us go through some sort of stress during Christmas. The film not a huge success when released in 1983 however home video and cable showing the show developed a huge following. Its easy to see why. It is the perfect family holiday film.

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't grow up in a bubble. I was exposed to television and movies before I can even remember.Being born in the early 1970's holiday movies were a tradition in my house. Those movies included Miracle on 34th Street and White Christmas. I was later exposed to classics like A Christmas Carol with the great Alistair Sim and It's a Wonderful Life with the legendary Jimmy Stewart.With that said I NEVER recall the release of A Christmas Story back in 1983. If it had some charm or significance I don't recall hearing a word about it. The first time I became even AWARE of the existence of the film was when TBS first aired it in 1996  FOR 24 CONSECUTIVE HOURS! I sat and tried to watch this movie with an open mind and it quickly became obvious to me why I'd never heard of this movie until 1996. Apart from Darrin McGavin there was no redeeming element to this sad depressing tale that is the poorest representation of a Christmas film that I've ever had the displeasure of viewing.And yet TBS continues its yearly tactic of forcing this overrated offensive and insulting attempt of a movie on the general public for 24 hours every year And it appears willing to do so for the REST of the ETERNITY. I've said it before on other movie boards NO MOVIE deserves this much exposure. Not Casablanca not Citizen Kane not the Wizard of Oz. NO MOVIE! I'm sure Jean Shepard is a nice guy and I guess I SHOULD be a fan of the movie because it's based on HIS experiences as a child growing up in Hammond Indiana  just a 10 minute drive from where I grew up.But how does a movie that had very little commercial or critical success become this mustsee holiday movie which has cheapened the classics that have come to define a TRUE holiday movie? It remains a mystery to me.What's even more of a mystery is how film critic Leonard Maltin whose reviews I generally agree with would be so duped by recent public appeal of the film Obviously brought on by TBS's continually yearly tactics that he would change his rating of the film from 3 12 stars to four. And yet he continues to keep The Shawshank Redemption at 2 12 stars despite the fact that public appeal for the movie is GREAT and is the most popular movie on the IMDb! The plot while based on Shepard's experiences is TERRIBLY over dramatized I have a HARD time believing Santa booting children down a slide and has little charm. It's a painful daybyday dirge through the depressing life of the Parker family around Christmas time and Ralphie's crusade of convincing EVERYONE that he wants a Red Ryder BB gun as a Christmas present. As far as I'm concerned NOT getting the gun would have been the ONLY thing to redeem the predictable contrived plot.Another reason why this movie does not hit home with me is that it lacks a relative message related to Christmas! The essence of Christmas can be defined in the story of redemption Which movies like A Christmas Carol Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life beautifully embody. Some might argue receiving a present could be considered a form of redemption but that would be a pretty SHALLOW example of the word.I guess in the end the yearly tactics of TBS have fueled my fire as much as how I just find the movie depressing and offensive. I know many will disagree with my review. But I prefer the aforementioned Christmas Classics and I'm very happy with that! A Christmas Story however remains the most OVERRATED movie EVER!".

	schema:reviewBody "It will never be a complete Christmas without watching a Christmas story. A Christmas Story is a significant kid's movie directed by Bob Clark. Based on the short stories and semifictional anecdotes of author and raconteur Jean Shepherd. The movie is based on a number of things one is his book 'In God We Trust All Others Pay Cash others derived from 'Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories' and others from short stories from Playboy magazine. All of them manage to mix in pretty well. I love Jean Shepherd's narration...a great storyteller. Glad he was given the job. He had a soothing voice that help inspired the creation of 1988's TV show The Wonder Years. Christmas Story tells the story of nine year old Ralphie Parker Peter Billingsley who wants one and only one thing for Christmas a BB gun. It's not just any BB gun he wants either his heart is set on an Official Red Ryder CarbineAction TwoHundredShot Range Model Air Rifle. Sadly everybody thinks it's a little too dangerous for him. Will Ralphie get the BB gun or will Christmas for him be a huge disappointment? Watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much the movie's main plot isn't that strong to stand by itself. So the writers add a lot of subplots to push the runtime for the film such as Ralphie's father Darren McGavin winning a major prize in a contest or Ralphie's friend Flick Scott Schwartz memorable getting his tongue stuck on the icy pole. The movie has tons of filler scenes. Some of them were hits to the funny bone while others were kinda a waste of time like the Bumpuse's dogs. Glad they cut the Flash Gordon fantasy sequence. It doesn't make sense with the rest of the film. For a kid's movie it's very smart. Examples are the mock heroic tone of the narration filled with great hyperbole motif full sentences. It matched well with the extensive use of familiar classical music themes. The movie is beautiful to listen to. You see a lot of leitmotifs references from other works such as author Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf story Harold Gray's comic strip Little Orphan Annie Television shows like 1940's Adventures of Red Ryder and films like 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  1939's Wizard of Oz. The movie was shot pretty well and the use of old timing locations really made it seem like it takes place in the late 1930searly 1940s. There is a debate about when the film takes place as the movie never state it but still I like the nostalgia feel of the film. I think the preWorld War II era America is a great location for this childhood majestic. The movie is very well acted. Looks for the cameo of director Bob Clark and Jean Shepard. It's pretty sad that none of the main cast went on to bigger success. It's pretty weird that actor Scott Schwartz became a pornstar for a while. Maybe one day they will. Some people might not like the film due to its off color humor. For a PG film it's got tons of some dirty jokes under aged swearing and violence  a few racist stereotype humor. The film was supposed to be RRated but the Rrated script was scrapped when the vice president of Higbee's the department store the filmmakers used for locations refused to allow the store to be associated with a movie depicting a kid dropping the Fbomb and the filmmakers were forced to change it. Honestly I think the movie became a lot clever with its swearing through it use of heavy euphemisms of gibberish. Still if you're looking for a movie to watch with small children. This movie might not be for you. For me personally I didn't mind it as it gives something that both adults and children might like. It's still a familyfriendly movie but there an edgy sense of humor that will be lost on little kids. Some people might hate it for its love for commercialization over the religious aspect of Christmas. Of course the holiday supposed to be about religion but I think most people like to get stuff for the holidays. Is it greedy to love films like this promoting materialism lifestyle. No because the movie was still made with a lot of heart and love and we still see the family in the end celebrating the holiday as a family unit. A Christmas Story did only modest boxoffice business in 1983 despite every critic I know saying it was a disappointment bomb when it came out. The film became a holiday classic due to the overplayed value of television. Often in Christmas movie marathons. It's estimated that nearly fiftyfive million Americans tune every year to watch the film making it a Christmas movie juggernaut. The film spawned a play as well as two sequels the madeforTV Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss and 1994's It Runs in the Family aka My Summer Story. Both are not worth watching as it has none of the original film's cast members. A DirecttoVideo sequel called A Christmas Story 2 was released on 2012. It's a miserable film that fans of the original must stay away from. In 2008 a documentary was made call 'Road Trip for Ralphie. It's a funwatch. Overall Hands down it's one of the best Christmas films ever. It is a mustwatch. You will have tons of fun!".

	onyx:emotionText "It will never be a complete Christmas without watching a Christmas story. A Christmas Story is a significant kid's movie directed by Bob Clark. Based on the short stories and semifictional anecdotes of author and raconteur Jean Shepherd. The movie is based on a number of things one is his book 'In God We Trust All Others Pay Cash others derived from 'Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories' and others from short stories from Playboy magazine. All of them manage to mix in pretty well. I love Jean Shepherd's narration...a great storyteller. Glad he was given the job. He had a soothing voice that help inspired the creation of 1988's TV show The Wonder Years. Christmas Story tells the story of nine year old Ralphie Parker Peter Billingsley who wants one and only one thing for Christmas a BB gun. It's not just any BB gun he wants either his heart is set on an Official Red Ryder CarbineAction TwoHundredShot Range Model Air Rifle. Sadly everybody thinks it's a little too dangerous for him. Will Ralphie get the BB gun or will Christmas for him be a huge disappointment? Watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much the movie's main plot isn't that strong to stand by itself. So the writers add a lot of subplots to push the runtime for the film such as Ralphie's father Darren McGavin winning a major prize in a contest or Ralphie's friend Flick Scott Schwartz memorable getting his tongue stuck on the icy pole. The movie has tons of filler scenes. Some of them were hits to the funny bone while others were kinda a waste of time like the Bumpuse's dogs. Glad they cut the Flash Gordon fantasy sequence. It doesn't make sense with the rest of the film. For a kid's movie it's very smart. Examples are the mock heroic tone of the narration filled with great hyperbole motif full sentences. It matched well with the extensive use of familiar classical music themes. The movie is beautiful to listen to. You see a lot of leitmotifs references from other works such as author Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf story Harold Gray's comic strip Little Orphan Annie Television shows like 1940's Adventures of Red Ryder and films like 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  1939's Wizard of Oz. The movie was shot pretty well and the use of old timing locations really made it seem like it takes place in the late 1930searly 1940s. There is a debate about when the film takes place as the movie never state it but still I like the nostalgia feel of the film. I think the preWorld War II era America is a great location for this childhood majestic. The movie is very well acted. Looks for the cameo of director Bob Clark and Jean Shepard.

Maybe too much copyguard?Even Clark couldn't recreate the special magic of this film. Two sequels one by Clark himself failed. A perfect ensemble cast and Darin McGavin's funniest role. Everything works The locations the nostalgic scenes the narration.Today this film probably couldn't be made the same way. The Chinese restaurant Christmas carol complete with terrible accent would offend Asian people.But I am rushing to the end of the movie. So many similar memories The house looks like my own childhood home. I had a yellowhaired bully at school. I used to play inside the kitchen cupboards. My school looked exactly like that. I got my mouth washed out with FelsNaptha soap. The dept. store reminds me of the old downtown Detroit Hudson's store. The mean Santa reminds me that I was scared of Santa at first. I had 2 aunts that perpetually thought I was 4yearsold and bought me baby toys and clothes. I hated clothing gifts anyway and only wanted toys. We constantly blew fuses as well in our underwired house. I never got a BB gun because I would shoot my eye out.Funniest scenes in no particular order 1. Flick's tongue stuck on the flagpole. 2. The bully chasing everyone and finally getting his just rewards. 3. The cheesy Christmas window display and parade at Higbee's Dept. Store. 4. The fishnet stocking leg lamp. It's a major award. 5. The fake swearing throughout. 6. The Bumpus' Hounds. 6.The Chinese turkey duck. It's smiling at me. 7. Ralphie defends the old homestead with his Red Ryder rifle. 8. It was soap poisoning! I am sure that I failed to include all of your favorite moments. I could go on for pages. Too funny to watch only at Christmastime. Even though it was made in 1983 it feels like an older movie.

	schema:headline " A spectacular portrayal of the unseen life of Charlie Chaplin.";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Downey Jr. first of all portrays Chaplin with amazing accuracy. Some parts of this performance are particularly memorable such as his invention of the famous tramp's walk just after having feverishly picked out the outfit the astonishingly accurate depiction of Charlie as an old man and of course the many parts of the film that involve parts of his life where he was working on his own films. These are clearly some of the most interesting parts of the movie if only because these films are how we know him but it is at least as interesting the way that the film hints towards things that happened in Chaplin's life that inspired those films.Very early in the film we see a scene in which Charlie's mother is booed off the stage by an impatient crowd so Charlie who is a little boy at the time gets on stage to do a song and dance of his own. He performs a song that is very similar to the one his mother performed but he wins the audience's heart and they respond by tossing coins onto the stage for him. You can't help noticing how this corresponds with the constantly youthful look of the Tramp in Modern Times for example Chaplin was in his late 40s but looked like a teenager and the coins tossed on stage may have played a significant role in helping him realize that this could be a good way to make money.Charlie moves to America to pursue his dream and we see the landmark events that punctuated his dizzying rise to stardom. He goes to work briefly on stage and is then hired by Mack Sennett a gigantic figure in film history but is unsatisfied because of his own lack of control over his work. It should also be noted here that there is a scene where he is working with director Mabel Normand who demands acting from him that he does not agree with and with whom he clashes. In 1914 Chaplin starred in a 9  minute film called Mabel's Busy Day in which he plays the uncharacteristic role of the antagonist. The Mabel in this film is a sporting event vendor who turns down Charlie's amorous advances after which Charlie proceeds to steal all of her products and hand them out to anyone standing nearby. Then in 1920 he starred in another short comedy called Mabel's Strange Predicament in which Mabel is a woman who becomes locked out of her hotel room in her pajamas and ends up avoiding the drunken Charlie for the rest of the film. In both films Charlie plays uncharacteristic roles the most unenviable of which was in Mabel's Busy Day which Mabel Norman directed.Later in the film we see Charlie in a small diner just after having terminated his employment with Mack Sennett and he meets Edna Purviance in a scene that is reminiscent of his romantic endeavors in such early films as Caught In A Cabaret and even more so The Immigrant one of his most famous early films. There are dozens of other references to the development of his cinematic personality  such as his sudden realization of how to make the Tramp appear rich to the blind girl in City Lights without talking as well as the dance of the dinner rolls which Charlie performs here at a dinner at an expensive restaurant  but there is an even more significant portrayal of Charlie's beliefs and his values in this movie that are more recognizable as well as more memorable to people not familiar with his earlier and less known work.Charlie Chaplin was one of many filmmakers' in the earlier times of the medium that resented and disapproved of the coming of sound to the movies. His Tramp remains one of the most recognized figures in the history of the cinema and it is widely known that the Tramp is an almost entirely silent character so it is necessary for a film about Chaplin's life to address this in some way and it is done perfectly here. There is a scene where Charlie's brother is trying to convince him to add spoken dialogue into his films and Charlie refuses outright giving a hilarious example of a Russian ballet dancer and saying The Tramp CAN'T talk. The minute he talks he's dead.' This is a brilliant way to illustrate Charlie's fondness for the silent film as well as his knowledge that no voice given to the Tramp would fit his character right. He was too well known to be changed so profoundly.Charlie Chaplin created 81 movies in his lifetime many of them timeless and truly memorable and has made a significant impact on the filmmaking medium as well as on the world itself. He was a fascinating personality both onscreen and off which is another element of his life that was necessarily and skillfully presented in this film this time directly in the dialogue in what is probably the single most important line in the entire film  If you want to understand me watch my movies.' Chaplin's everpresent sympathy for the underprivileged is subtly but effectively portrayed as two poor people approach him on his way out of a nice restaurant right at the beginning of the Great Depression asking for his autograph. The elderly Charlie notes in retrospect that I wish they'd wanted my money.' He is always aware throughout the film and throughout his life of the difficulties constantly facing poor people and he wants to give these people not only an escape with his films but hope for the future. There is a point in the film where Charlie has returned to Europe to see an old friend and he learns on the train that she has died. He is then asked What'll we do Charlie?' And his answer although spoken under his breath almost in a whisper rings louder than anything else in the film.Smile.'".

	schema:reviewBody "Chaplin isn't really a great biopic but there are moments when Richard Attenborough's direction shines and it's consistently got an amazing Robert Downey Jr. performance as the title character. In fact this is the kind of movie where the lead actor is so important that some of the major enjoyment and success of the film rests on himher oddly enough since it is a varied and superlative ensemble. There are moments when Attenborough's grandiosity gets in the way and the moments that mark it as being somewhat conventional. What made me pleasantly surprised is what Attenborough did decide to show with Chaplin the private man I thought that he would cut out much of the stuff with Chaplin's penchant for young usually underage girls or some of the things regarding his mother but most of the notorious facts are put in for good measure to counterbalance some of the pompous though fascinating scenes of cinematic history. Now as a fan of Chaplin's films and the given acknowledgment that he's one of the most talented comic actors and filmmakers of the 20th century I do get a little choked up seeing that final clipshow at the Oscars of great clips from his most famous movies. And it's interesting always from just a moviebuff standpoint to watch the history behind Chaplin's transition from vaudeville to Max Senett's film company to slowly becoming an independent and worldfamous auteurstar. But for the most part the writing and the direction make it entertaining just on that conventional risefallrisefallstrugglesuccessatend story with maybe less drugs and a bit more politics than one might usually see save for one fantastic scene when Chaplin and his brother and friends are sneaking around the film footage of The Kid from the brass who want it for tax purposes.What makes it almost outstanding however is Downey Jr. He's funny as Chaplin when he needs to show how he was a great clown i.e. the 'olddrunk' bit he's melancholy when needed he plays Chaplin as young middleaged and old perfectly and there's just the slightest details that keep you glued to the screen to see what he'll do next. It's not exactly a breakthrough role as he'd been doing some really good work intermittently in the late 80s but this is the one that got him recognition by the likes of the Academy and rightfully so. It's masterful work in a decent tribute to Sir Charles Tramp Chaplin and should delight those looking for a good ensemble and a commanding lead performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thankyou to Richard Attenborough for this film.  I watched it many a time and enjoyed both the biographical aspect and the comedic one but it has also increased my interest in silent comics of this great era.The film begins by exploring the early life of Charlie his Brother Sid and his Mother as they try to scrape a living.  Thankfully Attenborough doesn't concentrate too much on this deprived part of Chaplin's life. However it does reveal interesting facts about Charlie that he never forgot during his rise to superstardom.Although Chaplin is played by younger actors at the begining it is the arrival of Robert Downey Jnr which Chaplin fans will anticipate the most. He puts in an amazing performance his London accent is excellent and ability to do slapstick even better he also really makes you believe that the great man is alive and on the screen again.The film rightly concentrates on the private life of Chaplin and the development of the cinema.  Whilst others may want to see the film concentrate on Chaplin's great pictures e.g The Kid Gold Rush and the Great dictator Attenborough blends the creation of these films into specific turning points in Charlie's life.  For example Modern times is used to show Chaplin's sympathy towards victims of the wall street crash as he knew what it was like to be extremely poor.  His Jewish connections are also highlighted by the Great dictator  which shows his sensitivities to the European Jews were more at heart than just a making a heap of cash by having a laugh at Hitler's moustache and goose stepping troops.The film doesn't get bogged down by Chaplin's hectic love life as Dickie explores Charlie's political beliefs and how J Edgar Hoover was convinced of he was a communist party member.  By doing so it shows how Hoover was one of the most twisted individuals to hold public office  with a dangerous obsession on peoples private lives and background.The film does a good job in showing how important silent stars were and how we should not forget that they were the true greats when films were developing all the time from shorts to feature length from silent to sound.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first thing one should know about Chaplin is that paradoxically very little of it has to do with Chaplin. Or at least it has more to do with the writers' illusions of him. The film claims to be based on My Autobiography and on Chaplin His Life and Art by David Robinson. Having reread the Autobiography before watching the film it is clear to me that what the writers did was take basic incidents from the autobiography and embellish them with I can only assume parts of the Robinson book. What results is a series of scenes which were vaguely influenced by the facts but so simplified and primitive that little of the original truth remains. What the writers did not wish to acknowledge was that when Chaplin wrote vaguely or skimmed past certain parts of his life he really didn't want anyone to delve into them  and the filmmakers did just that. Chaplin is not really about Charlie Chaplin his work and films. It is simply ceaseless speculation on his personal life but going on even more vaguely about it than the Autobiography. I am well aware that almost every biopic focuses more on the personal life of a person than on their work. The problem is that most of the characters in Chaplin are so exaggerated and simplified that they become almost completely unbelievable  both as the real people AND as fictional characters. None of them are fully developed. This is not entirely the fault of the supporting cast although it really is not that interesting the fault lies with the screenplay which is too often bland and melodramatic. This is especially obvious in the ridiculous subplot concerning the older Chaplin and his editor which is the most pointless and badly done part of the film even Hopkins cannot make the lines sound credible which is all the proof anyone needs of their mediocrity. The film would have worked immeasurably better without these additions. Many of the most interesting aspects and parts of Chaplin's life are completely ignored oddly with seemingly irrelevant or less important stories added in for little reason. One scene in particular is added only to insert a Chaplinesquire physical comedy sequence which falls flat. The writers greatly accentuated everything to do with Hetty Kelly even making the same actress play Oona O'Neill the tried too hard to give him some kind of motive for his relationships which only leads to more bias and speculation and although I am by no means a Chaplin purist or even a very knowledgeable admirer the blatant alterations on the actual history grated on my nerves.All this being said the film is certainly not a terrible one. Mainly however this is for one reason only and that is  yes  Robert Downey Jr. himself. The praise he received for the role is by no means undeserved. As Chaplin he is perfect managing to make the best out of his rather predictable lines remaining interesting believable and in many parts moving. He has wonderful timing and intensity and even looks the part he could even do the roll dance. I really quite believed he was Chaplin. Even his performance however suffers greatly because of the lines  and the flashforwards. I have no doubt that he could have played an even better Charlie Chaplin in a differently made film.The greatest scene in Chaplin I think is the opening credits Charlie arrives in his dressing room alone sits and begins to remove his makeup. The scene is in black and white and there is no dialogue  only music. Every emotion is expressed simply through his eyes. If the rest of the film had been made like this I actually think it could have been perfect. Either way the lead performance is astounding the music is beautiful and though not very insightful or too true to history this film is well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "An attempt to make a film that is both honest and at the same time shamelessly selfserving about its autobiographical subject  the legendary comediandirector Chaplin  is pulled off with style.  It's fun to see some modern talents inhabit the roles of screen's bygone icons though in some cases a little less charicature would have been appreciated especially in the case of Mabel Normand.  Kline surprisingly enough makes a convincing Fairbanks.  The rest of the cast is also wellpicked  XFiles fans should watch closely to catch quite a few glimpses of lowerbilled David Duchovny as Chaplin's personal editor.  The direction is very good I particularly liked how some of the straight scenes were filmed in a comic surrealist style Chaplin's escape from the police w his cans of the Kid reels is staged like a Keystone Komedy while some of what might have been more comic elements are played straight Chaplin's attempt to convince his brother that The Tramp cannot talk in a movie is both funny and serious for example.

It's fun to see some modern talents inhabit the roles of screen's bygone icons though in some cases a little less charicature would have been appreciated especially in the case of Mabel Normand.  Kline surprisingly enough makes a convincing Fairbanks.  The rest of the cast is also wellpicked  XFiles fans should watch closely to catch quite a few glimpses of lowerbilled David Duchovny as Chaplin's personal editor.  The direction is very good I particularly liked how some of the straight scenes were filmed in a comic surrealist style Chaplin's escape from the police w his cans of the Kid reels is staged like a Keystone Komedy while some of what might have been more comic elements are played straight Chaplin's attempt to convince his brother that The Tramp cannot talk in a movie is both funny and serious for example.

	schema:reviewBody "Chaplin works on many levels because on the one hand it packs an entertaining epic in to two hours and thirty minutes but doesn't fail to keep up your interest and comes over as being very enjoyable. Perhaps the problem is that Chaplins life might not be the most suitable for a MOVIEpurely because his life was so eventful and might have translated itself better as a TV Mini Series but for getting the best out of what screen time available and still coming up with some very credible work you must hand it over to Richard Attenborough and everyone at Carolco. For starters the movie is simply beautiful to look at. The production design by Stuart Craig these days of Harry Potter fame is well tuned with the simply fantastic Cinematography by Sven Nykvist and this is why the movie works so well because at the more tedious intermissions the movie has to offer and there are only a few the movie is still interesting and prestine to watch. Just as good are Ellen Mirojnick and John Mollo's costumes designs in fact Chaplin offers a production so rich that at once i forgot that this was a period film and felt transported back to the various different time zones the movie had to offer and this is a good sign of a genius at work. Richard Attenborough did similar wonders with his Ghandi 1982 in my opinion he does it far more interestingly here. The real revelation of the movie is Robert Downey JR as Chaplin. I remember reading in a book entitled The Chaplin Encyclopedia that hearts sank when an American assumed the role. Well i cant really understand the kinetics behind this seeing that Chaplin spent 85 of his life away from England and was more of a worldwide Icon than a British spearhead plus the fact that Americans ARE Good Actors and Downey JR is one of the very finest. Charlie Chaplin himself was a couple of years before my time but Downey JR is so fantastic so realistic in the role that i didn't for one minute doubt the genius of the REAL Chaplin and in fact only became a fan of the little tramp after seeing this Biopic as though the missing pieces of Chaplins life had come together to complete the jigsaw. Downey JR carries the movie it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role he is the right build height and of simmilar looks and even nails the accent down. He even does The Little Tramp so covincingly that i think that Chaplin himself would have been forced to admit how good he is. This could prove to be Downey JR's best work on screen but i hope like many other of his admirers that things do go right for himand he gets on the right track and he is good to himself in future. On a side note i definitely think that Robert was worthy of the Academy Award for best actor for this but the BAFTA is more than Justified. Hopefully his role in the adaption of Denis Potter's The Singing Detective will be good enough for him to be recognised by the Academy. The only down side to the characterisation awarded to Robert Downey JR in the title role is that the other characters pale in significance. Admitedly it is nice to see the famous faces such as Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks Diane Lane Penelope Anne Miller and the Late great John Thaw in a heart rendering cameo as Chaplins great influence Fred Karno. But their characters are so limited that the come a cross as essential but perhaps slightly surplus. More impressive and important are the likes of Dan Ackroyd in an hillarious cameo as Mack Sennet and the interstingly cast Geraldine Chaplin as her own grandmother Hanna. The fact that Hannah Caplin was mentally ill and the effects it had on Charlie Chaplin are nicely hinted at but in large glossed over. Anthony Hopkins is it must be said wasted as the fictional George Hayden. It is however reassuring to see Hopkins and he himself 15 or so years earlier might have made a good Chaplin himself. Paul Rhys too is kept in the dark wich is unfortunate because the character he plays Chaplins brother sid was quite a big cog in the Chaplin works see Modern Timesjoke. The nicest other part is that of Hetty KellyOona Chaplin Chaplins first and last loves played by Moira Kelly. Kelly's presence adds a nice touch of grace and gentleness to the movie. Perhaps the real failing of the movie is like this review it tries to pack to much in and like i said this would have been better done as a TV Mini series or even two movies. These minor quibbles asides Chaplin boasts an enjoyably epic screenplay by Diana Hawkins William Boyd Bryan Forbes and the Legendary William Goldman based on David Robinsons ChaplinHis Life and Art and My Autobiography by Chaplin Himself. The movie is tightly directed and edited includes nice trick photography and is very professionaly and well acted particularly y Robert Downey JR but everyone ivolved does well no matter the merits of the characterisations. It also has one of the most beautiful moving musical scores by John Barry perhaps his best sadly over looked of scores. If you havent seen the movie i hope this review helps whet your appetite because it is a very worthwhile worth seeing movie..........".

Two actors who are underrated for their performances are Paul Rhys who played Sidney Chaplin and Moria Kelly who played both roles of Hetty Kelly and Oona O'Neil Chaplin. Kevin Kline is amazing as Douglas Fairbanks.  There is one scene in the film where Douglas Fairbanks knowing he is ill looks at his reflection in a mirror on the bar.

It is a wonder that with all of his personal problems in his relatively young life that Robert Downey Jr. doesn't appreciate the opportunities that have been handed to him.  There is incredible talent in this film  including a previously Oscarwinning director and actor Attenborough and Hopkins respectively and a female actor who would win an Oscar for another film that same year of 1992 Marisa Tomei.  Even Dan Aykroyd is almost overlooked as silent comedy filmmaker Mack Sennett.  Through Chaplin we realize that it was Mack Sennett who discovered Charlie Chaplin as well as other comedy greats at the beginning of Hollywood history.  Chaplin is underrated and sometimes underappreciated but it is a brilliant film that should be considered a classic when the time is appropriate.".

Robert Downy Jr is good  especially when he's playing a young Chaplin and the rest of the cast do a good job but i cant help but feel this film never really works. It's quite a dark film. Chaplin never looks happy and it's not until the end where he is excepting the Oscar do we really get to see a little bit what he was like on screen. The whole thing with him dictating to a biographer never works either and for me  this is Attenborough's biggest mistake. I would love to see someone have another go at making a film about Chaplin and give it a modern spin.Finally  if you have never seen a Charlie Chaplin film  i urge you to do so.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow this is one of the finest acting jobs I have seen as Robert Downey Jr. portrays the famous Charlie Chaplin. His performance includes some of Chaplin's famous slapstick moves and Downey is tremendous at executing them.To the film's credit it does show both the good and bad sides to this famous man. But it's definitely biased. Just check out how they portray J. Edgar Hoover a man Hollywood loves to hate along with any Conservative or Republican. Hoover is pictured as meanspirited and nasty throughout and is even blasted in the ending credits! His first speech at a dinner table intended to show him in a negative actually shows him to be prophetic whether Tinseltown ever admits it or not. Regarding Chaplin if the film was the truth that's always a big if then it WAS a real miscarriage of justice to kick him out of the country for having a baby he didn't produce. Nevertheless most of the film centers around his career and his wives most of whom were very pretty with great figures.....but too young most of them being teenagers!Also shown nicely in the film are Chaplin's talent his obsession with work his great friendship with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Kevin Kline the great films he produced and the sympathy he had with the American poor. On the other side in addition to his pedophile instincts one wonders why Chaplin never became an American citizen? They certainly did not help his cause.The movie sports a bigname cast with Kline probably providing the most likable role next to Downey. The women were very interesting from Geraldine Chaplin playing Charlie's insane patheticallysad mother to beauties like Milla Jovovich Diane Lane and Moria Kelly the latter playing Chaplin's final and devoted wife Oona. Also in here are some big names Anthony Hopkins Dan Ackroyd Penelope Ann Miller Marissa Tomei James Woods Nancy Travis and Paul Rhys. They all help make this a memorable biography. It's beautifully filmed with a number of stunning scenes and also has a classy soundtrack. The ending is manipulative but it works. It always brings a tear to my eye.I liked what they did at the end with the small biographies of all the leading characters and visually showing who played each one. I wish all films did that.".

	schema:reviewBody "The IMDb trivia for Attenborough states regarding his cinematic thinking states that Philosophies include believing in content as opposed to style and sincerity rather than intelligence.Sometimes these things work in his films but the fact is that in art sincerity is almost always obtained through intelligence and honesty has little to do with truth. Chaplin knew it so none of his films are true in a strict sense of the word but all of them are above all honest. This why all and all i don't quite enjoyed this film because it failed to reach the content of Chaplin's work. Attenborough is nevertheless very competent and so is his camera work many times quite interesting though in these concerns as well as editing watch his bright A bridge too far and that very aspect makes this partially worth the time.what do we do? We smileFor me Chaplin is one of the synonyms for emotion in cinema. Films become part of people's lives. Many get into those lives bended by context which means the ones people had the opportunity good or bad luck to watch. Chaplin got into my life quite early and for a long time i never understood exactly what he did i don't remember in my childhood watching a full film of his but many excerpts are part of my visual memories chaplin for children. Growing up and understanding how all the drama all the emotion beyond the funny exists in his cinema was a true revelation to me and a gate into cinema as an art. the clown effect the tramp always smiling is always capable of showing the beautiful and the horrible the dark and the shiny dark in what it shows shiny in what it comes to provoke. This is humanism in cinema in my personal thoughts. From what I know Chaplin is at the top of those who tried to master this.In the particular film emotion is left to the end which is nevertheless fully made after cinema paradiso. But its strenght is there because it simply displays Chaplin's films. The most successful option here to my view would have been to bring out content instead of facts. So back to the citation from IMDb's trivia what i find here is a different notion of content different than my own which for Attenborough ended up as a collection that i would call a little bit dull of facts making cinema secondary. In the movie Chaplin says if you want to know me watch my movies. That would be the keyNevertheless Downey Jr is very very strong here and his physical acting is truly remarkable.Meanwhile as a biographical movie my personal choice still goes to the very recent and relatively unknown life and death of Peter Sellers for it reaches much more into the soul of the artist.My evaluation 25 overall a failure even though it's not bad to watch mainly due to Downey's Jr acting and some camera workhttpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

	onyx:emotionText "The IMDb trivia for Attenborough states regarding his cinematic thinking states that Philosophies include believing in content as opposed to style and sincerity rather than intelligence.Sometimes these things work in his films but the fact is that in art sincerity is almost always obtained through intelligence and honesty has little to do with truth. Chaplin knew it so none of his films are true in a strict sense of the word but all of them are above all honest. This why all and all i don't quite enjoyed this film because it failed to reach the content of Chaplin's work. Attenborough is nevertheless very competent and so is his camera work many times quite interesting though in these concerns as well as editing watch his bright A bridge too far and that very aspect makes this partially worth the time.what do we do? We smileFor me Chaplin is one of the synonyms for emotion in cinema. Films become part of people's lives. Many get into those lives bended by context which means the ones people had the opportunity good or bad luck to watch. Chaplin got into my life quite early and for a long time i never understood exactly what he did i don't remember in my childhood watching a full film of his but many excerpts are part of my visual memories chaplin for children. Growing up and understanding how all the drama all the emotion beyond the funny exists in his cinema was a true revelation to me and a gate into cinema as an art. the clown effect the tramp always smiling is always capable of showing the beautiful and the horrible the dark and the shiny dark in what it shows shiny in what it comes to provoke. This is humanism in cinema in my personal thoughts. From what I know Chaplin is at the top of those who tried to master this.In the particular film emotion is left to the end which is nevertheless fully made after cinema paradiso. But its strenght is there because it simply displays Chaplin's films. The most successful option here to my view would have been to bring out content instead of facts. So back to the citation from IMDb's trivia what i find here is a different notion of content different than my own which for Attenborough ended up as a collection that i would call a little bit dull of facts making cinema secondary.

It doesn't work and the sections of film seem strangely disjointed and fail to conjoin into a whole. Apart from a wonderful performance from Robert Downey as Chaplin himself the rest is a mess and worst of all the film is plain BORING!

His genius was one of visual abstraction  the humor was just a strategy to engage the audience. Orson Welles thought City Lights' the most important film ever made and by that I think he meant the first overtly selfreferential master manipulation of the medium.Making a film about Chaplin has got to be one of the sweetest most ineluctable notions ever. One would presume that such a film would use Limelight' as a conceptual foundation. But since modern tastes want the raw personalities and since Chaplin's energies were at root sexual one would expect a film that focuses on abstractions from sex as the mechanism for mass engagement. One would expect us to to see and understand how his energies in life were transmuted by much effort and reflection into related energies on the screen. One would expect us to see a similar struggle in the commitment from Attenborough.Alas Attenborough is more Sennett than Chaplin someone with skills by exposure but who lacks passion and intellect. Instead we get the selfreference from an unexpected source Downey. He is not allowed to be a sexual being here and incidentally neither are the women in the parade of pulchritude he thrashes through they are here cast as demure models instead of directly animal beings  more film beings than magnets for Chaplin's force.Bereft of the sexual drive Downey is forced to give us an internal being who progressively complicates his thoughts on their way to physicality someone who eventually spends years on projects that previously took days. He already was seriously addicted to drugs here and one can see the marvelous resonance of internal torture of Downey overlain on Chaplin. A double tragedy unfolds before our eyes and amazingly behind Attenborough's back. Attenborough does deal honestly with the personal vendetta of Hoover and the national embarrassment of the exile. But little context is established for how overt intense and ambiguous was the struggle among Hollywood intellectuals and between them and the brutality of Washington and press associates. We need to have a film about how close Hoover brought America to revolution. What we get instead is a focus on his poverty brother's jewishness and mother's insanity. I think that is a mistake.Incidentally one could spend time in worse ways than studying how the comic timing of films was invented and how it has been both copied and evolved at the same time. Watch Chaplin. Then watch Downey doing Chaplin. He does an honest job placing his Chaplin in Chaplin's time not our own Then watch Depp do Downey doing Chaplin Benny and Joon' but placed in the context of evolved notions of today's physical timing.

	schema:headline " Emotional wonderfully performed but ultimately flawed biopic";
	schema:reviewBody "Very rarely does a film make me feel ambivalent as this one. I loved it for Chaplin for performances accurate scenes but disliked it for its generally dark tone missed details and portrayal of Chaplin as an angry distant egocentric.Seeing Robert Downey Jr. not only become Chaplin but perform his stunts little quirks and fun parts with Chaplin's gentleness and force sometimes was a revelation. I could go on and on about Robert Downey Jr. If you are like me and have managed to not see this film all these years then do so if nothing just for his performance. It is worth it.Other actors were fantastic too and there is quite a list of big names who performed wonderfully well Kevin Klein as Douglas Fairbanks Anthony Hopkins Marisa Tomei Dan Aykroyd Geraldine Chaplin portraying her own grandmother and what a portrayal! etc.Photography sets costumes everything was just as one would hope it would be in a biopic about such an important artist as Chaplin. I also liked that many true events were accurately portrayed in the film. The attention to visual detail was refreshing. I wish I could say the same of the story though.Anyone who read a bit about Chaplin knows what an emotional rollercoaster his life has been. Roller coaster means highs and lows. In Chaplin we only get the lows.This is further made worse by the gimmicky addition of a biographer who is talking to Chaplin about his autobiography just as we have immersed ourselves into the story making sure that we are quickly kicked out of it. Whatever emotional connection is established is quickly lost. The only thing that scenes with the biographer do is retard the story and kill the film.His rise from slums of east London to the king of Hollywood was incredible in reality yet entirely missed in this film. He becomes a millionaire just like that. In one scene he is a vaudeville actor working for peanuts in another he comes to Hollywood and gets paid a little more and then it seems that everyone knows about him without our ever seeing how this happened. Even his homecoming to a crowded station in London was scaled down truth was that the euphoria was greater even than the one that Beatles experienced. Chaplin was so famous and well liked all over the world that even Hitler who hated Chaplin grew Chaplin's mustache to try and be more likable.This overall dark story which intentionally skips the highs and focuses on lows interrupted by fictitious biographer and old Chaplin who add nothing of value anyway is what makes this film fall flat on its face. It did not help that many important points in the film while accurate were portrayed with key pieces missing for instance his theater performance was noticed by a Hollywood bigwig who proceeded to offer him a job via a telegram with his name misspelled as Charlie Chapman... We never see any of that. He just gets a telegram with the job offer out of the blue.This is unfortunate as one can easily find tons of material about Chaplin that could be added to show what a blast he had and that it was all result of hard work not dumb luck. Consider some of these factsWhen he started shooting The Great Dictator British government told him that they would ban his film due to policy of appeasement. He shot the film anyway. By the time Chaplin finished it Hitler attacked Britain and appeasement policy was reversed making Chaplin's film more than welcome over night.Chaplin was never really denied entrance to the US. He heard through his connections that Hoover was going after him in a big way and that he would be persecuted more and more and that his work visa would not be renewed. He decided to just leave the country before anything more serious happened to him. While in NY mere hours prior to his departure he decided to phone Richard Avedon and offer to sit in his studio for a portrait. Avedon thought it was a prank call.The Lita Grey affair cost Chaplin in more ways than one. During the trial his hair turned entirely white even though he was only 37 at the time.It is said that Chaplin owned the famous Culver hotel in Culver City which he lost to John Wayne in a poker game who then proceeded to donate it for good cause... Chaplin was not all work and obsession he was a clown as he said it himself many times.Those are just some examples but the biggest missing point is failure to portray his rise from obscurity to stardom and how great that was especially in those times. Even more importantly his influence on Hollywood and film as an art form and his big heart was entirely missed. I don't even know if most viewers truly got it that it was him and Mary Pickford that founded United Artists Studio D. Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith were just investors. He is almost portrayed as an egomaniac when in reality he was anything but that. He kept helping and even financially supporting fellow actors in Hollywood even after he moved to Switzerland that's who Chaplin really was.To portray the funniest most creative filmmaker in such dark tones while missing to connect the dots is a failure of this film. His life was all about overcoming yet from Chaplin we are led to believe that he was a miserable character.Chaplin's life has a lot more to offer the viewer and it would be a joy to see his life story given a better treatment on the big screen.".

Some writersdirectors are able to edit the life story of a person down to two hours or less The Desert Fox and most old Warner Brothers' biopics being good examples of this. When this is too difficult often as in the case of Patton and Lawrence of Arabia the film will focus on a specific important period of the character's life. Chaplin tries to focus on all of Chaplin's life over the course of a two and a half hour movie and fails miserably.Well that isn't fair. I shouldn't say it's a complete failure. In terms of production values it does a great job of capturing the time period portrayed  the '20s and '30s when cinema was first turning from a novelty into the art form and indispensible entertainment medium it is today. Robert Downey Jr. does a fantastic job as Chaplin and deserves all the credit he has gotten for his performance.But the fact is Chaplin's life is too complex and multifaceted to fit into a twoandahalf hour film  maybe even into a four hour epic like Lawrence of Arabia. Most of the major events and people and in his life are barely touched upon before the film moves on. Admittedly they pretty much have to the way the film is set up. But innumerable shouldbeimportant characters are scuttled after only a few minutes of screen time.The supporting cast is a huge rogue's gallery of A and Blist stars in cameos and supporting roles with very mixed results. The best are Geraldine Chaplin ingeniously cast as her own grandmother Kevin Dunn as J. Edgar Hoover though IMO his character was given perhaps too prominent of a part Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks and Dan Ankroyd as the director who first made Chaplin a star. The rest of the cast is as said above a riot of cameo appearances with actors like Diane Lane Marisa Tomei and James Woods to name a few of the more prominent examples on screen just long enough for the viewer to say Hey it's !  which needless to say gets annoying after awhile. Anthony Hopkins' author character in particular is a waste of that fine actor's talent. And while it's amusing to see a teenage Milla Jovovich and preXFiles David Duchovny before they became famous they're certainly not enough to watch the movie for. If this were just the case for one or two characters it would be no problem but there are undoubtedly going to be problems when pretty much EVERY FRICKIN' CHARACTER falls under such a category.As a film Chaplin is hit or miss. It's got a number of good elements  Attenborough's great direction Downey's fine performance and a few of the more prominent supporting characters  but unfortunately tries to cram too much into 143 minutes. I'd suggest checking it out but don't expect a masterpiece.510".

But the rest... how uninspired is everything! Hopkins' fictional character is absolutely pointless and pretentious the portraits of Chaplin's women are so superficial as the historical content the FBI in a 30yearspermanent paranoic attitude towards the dangerous tramp huuh... all the details picked up from Chaplin's autobiography are or unreflected or badly told p. g. the scene where the mother says If you only had brought me a cup of tea  you DON'T understand this if you haven't read the book and it loses all is meaning 'cause there is a mix of guilt fear and love in the feelings of the boy that is almost lost in the scene and the film... No this is not a welltold movie. Apart from the fact that it offers no deeper relection on what it IS to be a comedian or a genius. Boring. The best part is without the shadow of a doubt the final part where we have the possibility to see original Chaplinfilmscenes. That indeed could be a merit of this movie it makes you want to watch the true Chaplin.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chaplin the movie takes a lot of patience. At 2 hours 20 minutes and not always moving along at a brisk pace it is easy to get bored unless you really want to know about this icon of the American film industry Charles Chaplin the transplanted then exiled Brit.  Written in is a fictional character George Anthony Hopkins who is interviewing Chaplin at his home in Switzerland during the twilight years.  The film covers about 70 years of his life from a young boy of about 5 or 6 who entertains the audience after his mom was booed off the stage to his special honor at the Academy awards in the 70s. In between we see his genius in film and his troubles caused primarily by his womanizing instincts apparently not able to resist a young and beautiful girl even marrying two or three different teenagers. But his biggest nemesis turned out to be J Edgar Hoover who was successful preventing his reentry to the USA after Chaplin left in 1952 for a visit to England. All because of the witchhunt for Communists.SPOILERS  George has a list with him of items he must ask Chaplin. Near the end we find out that it is part of trying to see if Charlie was afflicted with the same thread of insanity suffered by both his mother and grandmother.  Chaplin was not and  simply was a flawed genius of a man who always had sex on his mind when not working. A perfectionist who labored for days weeks months to get the editing of a film just right. One of his wives Diane Lane asks Is this what cause all the others to leave? He answered Maybe you'll have to ask them. Although we know him as a funny man he was very hard to get along with partly because of his low tolerance for what he thought we incompetents or those with foolish ideas. he could not turn his head he preferred confrontation.  I can relate.Good movie semiautobiographical I rate 8 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "It may appear superfluous to remark that more than a mere 143 minutes are required for if the life of Charles Chaplin is to be dramatized successfully on film. Chaplin who passed away at the age of eightyeight not only witnessed and experienced the enormous changes which took place during the twentieth century both in cultural sociological and technological ways but he himself actually turned out to become one of the most influential personalities of his own time. Director Richard Attenborough no doubt understood this when he set out to make the film CHAPLIN having been a huge fan of the comedian since childhood. However although responsible for a reported amount of four hours of footage Attenborough was seemingly forced to cut the film down considerably. As a result the finished film is a mixed experience but there certainly are good things to be found in it as well.Inevitably many candidates turned up with the hope of playing Chaplin but the one that apparently possessed that special something was a young Robert Downey Jr. His performance has received unanimous praise through the years and made him an Academy Award nomination. Indeed there is no doubt that Downey did a phenomenal job I cannot imagine anyone doing it better than him. Having been trained by firstrate pantomimist Dan Kamin Downey nails the character of the Tramp quite well and he deserves all possible praise for handling the many emotional situations in Chaplin's life so convincingly. Yet I must admit that to me personally Downey doesn't really resemble Chaplin certainly not physically and his voice is so distinctively different that it somewhat affects the credibility of his general appearance in the film as well. I don't mean these words to be insults because as said I can't think of anyone doing it better than him but I don't quite believe he truly IS Charlie Chaplin in the same way that I may be fooled to believe that Ben Kingsley truly IS Ghandi.The rest of the cast is generally excellent particularly Chaplin's eldest daughter Geraldine delivers a convincing sensitive portrayal of her own grandmother and also a quite distressing one considering the pain this poor woman had to suffer in her life. Dan Aykord's portrayal of producer Mack Sennett the one who first hired Chaplin in films may seem to be a caricature but this is not necessarily in conflict with how many of Sennett's associates remembered the man Aykord behaves just the way I would've expected Sennett to do based on interviews I've read with the man and his autobiography. Kevin Kline is also worthy of great praise bringing silent era playboy Douglas Fairbanks to life in a charming performance. One reason why several of the portrayals of Chaplin's associates work so well may be that they are surrounded by such authentic sets Geraldine Chaplin expressed in an interview that a shock came over her as she witnessed her father's studio being rebuilt exactly as it was. No less successfully have the home quarters of Chaplin's childhood in the slums of the lateVictorian era been reconstructed.Unfortunately all these rewarding aspects of the film are somewhat haltered by the feeling that they could have been used to greater effect and more thoroughly than what we see in the finished film. Clearly the film has suffered from the large cuts which Attenborough was forced to make as there is a nail thin structure to talk about several of the incidents that occur in the film would I imagine be difficult to understand to anyone not that familiar with the life of Chaplin. Much like the more recent film about Nelson Mandela and the circumstances around Apartheid GOODBYE BAFANA we are with CHAPLIN given an opportunity to see the most central aspects of the life of a famous person being brought to life with authenticity but without the length required in order to analyze or even fairly explain these aspects. The scene changes from one period of Chaplin's life to another without really exploring any of them and leaving out many highpoints of his life and career for instance Chaplin's making of the Mutualfilms which many consider to be his noblest work is barely referred to. Furthermore the film suffers from factual errors some of which may be forgiven for the sake of dramatic effect but they are also often annoying as many viewers are likely to take his film thoroughly as fact. For instance when Chaplin receives a telegram from the Keystone studio inviting him to join the medium of films he appears quite amazed in his autobiography Chaplin admitted that he had been rather disappointed with the telegram as the Keystonefilms had not impressed him. Most disturbing of all is how certain characters are portrayed particularly Mabel Normand and Chaplin's brother Sydney. Mabel and Chaplin did have a fight at a set early on but what is not mentioned in the film is that they reconciled shortly afterwards and remained friends thereafter. In the film Mabel comes across as quite unsympathetic which is not synonymous with the sweet natured and talented girl most of her associates remembered. Even more disturbing is how Sydney Chaplin is presented Sydney was generally very supportive of Charlie and his artistic decisions yet this film claims otherwise. Nothing I've read about Chaplin and I've done my research through the years indicates that Sydney ever tried to convince his brother not to make THE GREAT DICTATOR.Despite several shortcomings CHAPLIN is worth to watch due to some memorable performances as well as the many handsome authentic sets. And in case I forgot to mention it the musical score by John Barry is magnificent beautiful beyond the spoken word among my favorite soundtracks of all time. However to anyone seriously interested in Chaplin I'd rather recommend David Robinson's highly informative biography on the man or the comedian's own memoirs or to watch Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's brilliant documentary UNKNOWN CHAPLIN.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has an apt title. It starts out with some life and then chokes to death on its own indolent vomit. Writerdirector Jon Keeyes sets up an interesting and multilayered conflict and then like he blew a brain fuse or something he fritters away every last ounce of potential as the movie gets dumber and dumber and dumber until it ends in a twist so cretinous I almost suspect Keeyes let his pet hamster write the last 3 pages of the script.The story opens with a quartet of gunwielding robbers storming into the offices of Duca Enterprises and taking all the money in the office's walk in safe. The cops show up before the robbers can escape and one of them is shot to death while the other three seek refuge in a caf across the street. Once inside though the three remaining robbers and everyone else are taken hostage by two thugs who are much more violent and much stupider than our initial gang of thieves. The thugs couldn't resist the sight of two duffel bags full of money coming into the caf just as they were having lunch. Meanwhile the local cops on the outside of the caf have to deal with the interference of the owner of Duca Enterprises who comes off like a cross between Boss Hogg from the Dukes of Hazard and the guy with the wings in his hair from the Sopranos along with an ATF agent who thinks he's living his own personal Quentin Tarantino movie.Now it might not blow you away but that's a cute little set up for a crime flick. There are several different dramatic dynamics established that could each go in different directions. For the first 15 to 20 minutes of Living and Dying I really wanted to see how the story would end up. Unfortunately where it went was down the rathole of poor plotting terrible characterization some remarkably inconsistent acting from Edward Furlong a couple of inappropriate European accents and a rape scene that seems to be in the movie solely to satisfy the particular predilection of Jon Keeyes.This thing flails about with no idea of what it's doing or who the film is focused on. There's a subplot that's so crudely developed it's practically preembryonic yet still manages to blatantly contradict itself. Michael Madsen looks like he's lost at sea doing that same Michael Madsen shtick he always does but in an almost plaintive manner as though he's trying to signal someone to rescue him from this mess. Furlong's performance switches about halfway through from trying reasonably hard to not giving a crap about anything. The hero cop of the film played by Arnold Vosloo is entirely emasculated and then offered up again to the audience as though they should take him seriously.Oddly the best thing about Living and Dying is the acting of Ling Bai. She's best known as a tabloid chick who sort of sustains herself on a level somewhere below Tila Tequila in the pseudocelebrity ecosystem. Though she's not asked to do a lot here she's convincing both as a mother driven to crime to get back her daughter and as someone shot in the gut. That is she's convincing as a gunshot victim until the movie becomes so moronic that it treats her injury like a hangnail.After a promising beginning this film turns into garbageand it's a more annoying sort of garbage for having started off decently. Unless you need to buck up your selfimage by watching a movie made by someone obviously more feeblewitted than you aregive this one a pass.".

He has a oneliner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script. You know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like Furlong is even acting. Maybe that's why his performance was good. Same with Madsen. You keep thinking I bet this guy is really like this in real life. Does Madsen even have to act? Just natural. Vosloo has obviously moved on from the typecasted Mummy guy. I think the biggest surprise to this film was Jordana Spiro's performance. Her reactions are spoton in this film. I battled if she was hot or not but realized I would just like to see more of her. Not a big fan of shoot 'em outhostage type films. But what I am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing. It's not just your standard robbers take over a bank they kill hostages and the good guys win in the end type of film. The twists keep on coming...and coming.The caf scenes work best with the handheld cams to show what it's really like in there. Not glossed over a bit. Think like Bourne Ultimatum lite style on some scenes in the caf.And for those Bo Bice fanatics out there  actor Curtis Wayne who plays Karl will make you do a double take. These guys are twins.As I watched I wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town. Made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countriesstates so they might have these accents. But more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for International audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of. And some of them are smoking hot. Moncia Dean? Need I say more.".

Interested enough I decide to give it a shot later.. It was a tough to bear experience believe me. Then after finally seeing the credits roll I tought 'We Turks really suck at Hollywood style film making.. This is an insult to the heisthostage movie genre..' but then wait! I checked some names and no they were not Turkish names and no this was not a Turkish movie on the contrary it was literally shot in America with an American director  crew! That made me thinkingagain! How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably.. That kept me thinking further.. How can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer.By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find. And if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produceor vice versa I don't have any information on that. So bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as.. It makes you think in my case even meditate and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn't give even that affect.. This one at least makes you think It makes you wonder.. It leaves you with disbelief.. and then It makes you wonder again..".

I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a caf to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station. Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation. This was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future.".

Their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional.Even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish. It was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this film. There was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American whining voice like a girl shouting lines like Lets get the Fk out of here and What are we going to do man. He sounded like a girl. As a positive It was funny to watch and it made me laugh too. For a few seconds. Whoo Hoo ! Dumb Film. Poor Madsen. He will bounce back...".

And this story still reserves a couple of twists three or four in fact that maybe are not very believable but at least are unexpected.The film has its flaws the gunfires are a little slow and not so exciting as the director hopes but sometimes this shortcoming becomes a virtue giving a touch of realism to the action the two bad guys especially one of them overact and Michael Madsen... well Madsen has become in last years a parody of himself but that's not bad here considering that his character is a total asshole.However the rest of the cast is fine. I liked very much Arnold Vosloo sober and credible and the always outstanding Bai Ling if you have doubts about her talent just watch Red Corner. Also I liked Edward Furlong and the support cast. And yes this is a low budget movie but money is not always a necessary condition for getting something interesting and acceptable.To pay attention on the weak points or the strong ones depends only on the mood and expectations of the viewer. In my case I have seen potential and good moments and I have enjoyed with what I have seen.".

It was a pretty good opening but from there it descends into your typical slow moving hostage drama with paranoid cops scared hostages and unreasonable demands. Edward Furlong stars in this HBO thriller and continues to be one of my favorite actors. He is so unappreciated and disrespected in Hollywood because he was a child actor and will forever be known as that cute kid in Terminator 2. His Costar is Michael Madsen is by far the worst actor I have ever seen. The guy thinks he's John Wayne but the second he tries to show any emotion people start laughing because he is really that unbelievable. Madsen brings down the credibility of everything he is in which makes me wonder how this guy continues to get work.

Let's say I wasn't in the right state of mind for this movie at that time... I am glad I suddenly decided to rewatch it yesterday. The cinematography is so perfect there were scenes my breath was caught somewhere in my throat... The colors if you decide to watch it just download it and preferably HD the bigger the file the better trust me were driving me crazy! The hill on which they placed the mailbox became one of the places I want to visit before I die it's the most beautiful peaceful place! The way they shot it at least made me want to go theresometimes it seemed I could even see the wind blowing the grass and the hair of two lonely characters standing there... The plot is simple and honestly I didn't need more complicated as the scenes were so rich visually other complications were unnecessary... Acting is wonderful! As a big fan of Han HyoJoo one more time came to adore her character. First thing about JaeJoong I noticed was his husky voice which drove me crazy I was WAITING for him to talk... I think he was a perfect person to portray JaeJoon... The music is very complimentary to the movie perfect match... calm relaxing and light... Also the symbolic meaning of the movie adds to it value so much more... White lies to help people is it right or wrong? Teaching a lesson by making the person to look at life from a whole another angle of life... Learning how to withstand the difficulties of life from zero... falling in love after being hurt...falling in love...".

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews Painted Skin The Resurrection II 2012  China Australian Premiere";
	schema:reviewBody "Seriously who can possibly resist the temptation of the flawless and seductive display from the everwonderful Zhou Xun a much improved performance from Zhao Wei after her dismal role in last year's Mulan and of course the insanely cute portrayal by Mini Yang. Like the 2008 prequel Painted Skin to truly embrace the experience the audience needs to slip into the film like a dream and suspend all beliefs. The more you escape from reality and believe into the world of Painted Skin The Resurrection the more you will end up enjoying the experience. It is one of those special films that require the audience to just go with the flow enjoy the scenery the onscreen beauties on display over the top action sequences some truly wonderful acting and along with the stunning bright visuals on display.Zhou Xun is simply flawless in her display as the spirit that wants to be more human than human. However while this film shares the same issue as Ridley Scott's classic Bladerunner the issue of wanting to be more human is only given a superficial flick of a dice. Still Zhou is able to carry the film and the manner in which she seductively graces the screen is nothing short of amazing. In particular her noticeable dance to seduce the General played by Chen Kun is certainly a highlight. It should also be noted that when the Zhou is required to switch roles with Zhao Wei it is Zhou who is able to seamlessly step into the shoes of the princess character. It's been a while since Zhou's winning performance in Perhaps Love and while she may not win this year another nomination is only just around the corner.In terms of Zhao Wei one must say that she gets better with age. This does not mean that she is aging well in terms of beauty but rather the improvement comes in the form of her acting. After the disappointing Mulan where the fault lies more in the director and the script rather than her ability in question Zhao stands shoulder to shoulder in the role of a princess who values beauty and exterior over the need of being a human. Her character is a direct contrast to Zhou Xun and she performs particularly well until the two switches bodies. There is a sadness in her eyes that allows the audience to always sympathize with her. It is a natural ability that cannot be taught and in many ways she was always like this. Think back to Shaolin Soccer days the tears in her eyes when she made the noodles still stands firmly on the back of my mind. While she did not exceed Zhou in terms of acting there is no doubt that Zhao is finally coming of age.After first catching my eye in All's Well Ends Well 2012 as the swimsuit babe tackling a relatively difficult and engaging role in Love in the Buff and then meeting her in person at the same movie premiere it is unreservedly that Mini Yang is the latest it girl to win my heart. What impressed me in this role is how versatile Yang is. Yang is constantly cute and perhaps the one character in the film that can link more to reality at a human level. Her giggles laughs cuteeyed look and comic timing is all at show here. While on surface it seems like an easy role to play it should not be underestimated as it is a kind of role that can so easily go the route of being outright annoying and a waste of space. Instead Yang is able to glue the audience to the screen and turn her small role into a scene stealing performance. Putting aside my personal bias Yang is still an actress to watch for years to come.It must be said that one cannot stop being disappointed in the lack of a need for 3D or perhaps for the film not making most of the technology on hand. While Painted Skin The Resurrection is beautiful to look at and at times the bright contrast and use of colours in the scenery and backdrop is breathtaking to endure. On the other hand in the battle scene where the shooting of thousands of arrows is disappointing to say the least despite obviously taking a page out of Zhang Yimou's infamous Hero scene. While Yimou did not have the same technology back in 2002 Skin fails to stretch the 3D technology and the result lacks the outcome of Yimou's earlier work. The film always lacks the vital ingredient of fight sequences this may be due to the departure of Donnie Yen but for the few fights that is included almost all of them are wellchoreographed. However sometimes less is not more when the film could have done with at least a few more elaborated staged fights.All in all Painted Skin The Resurrection is easily a crowd pleaser and in many ways more of the same as the 2008's original. What I really enjoy about these kinds of fantasy films are the manner in which it allows you to escape into another world. Imagine having a dream which compose of the seductiveness of Zhou Xun the sympathetic looks of Zhao Wei and the cuteeyed Mini Yang. For me it is more like a dream come true. Still Skin is by no means a perfect movie and as with most dreams there are numerous plot holes flaws and unrealistic moments but if one is able to totally suspend your beliefs then one can truly enjoy the experience. At the end of the day sometimes when watching a film like Painted Skin The Resurrection it is all about entertainment and for me just thinking of the trio of actresses I am already finding it hard to resist. Most certainly a dreamlike experience Neo 2012 Neo rates it 810 www. thehkneo.comblog".

At the end of the day sometimes when watching a film like Painted Skin The Resurrection it is all about entertainment and for me just thinking of the trio of actresses I am already finding it hard to resist. Most certainly a dreamlike experience Neo 2012 Neo rates it 810 www. thehkneo.comblog";

	schema:reviewBody "I have just watched Painted Skin 2  The Resurrection yesterday. What a movie! I don't usually write reviews for movies to much timeconsuming but to this movie I feel the urge to do that because it is totally worth it.Firstly I would like to stress the fact that this kind of fantasy movie is not just for anyone. Being in a country closely related to China in terms of culture custom and even language I feel sorry for viewers from Western countries as well as many others as it's impossible for them to understand the story well. The concept of demons under the skin of a beauty seducing men for their hearts is not new in fact it's a fantasy tale that has been spread among Asia for thousands of years. Hence the movie itself leaves a very mysterious and beautifully thrilling impression to people who are familiar to the tale.Opening the movie is the scene of the fox demon being imprisoned under the deadly cold ice. Such was the demon's beauty that a demon bird was attracted freeing her from the ice. Then her journey of devouring human's hearts began with the aim of finding a human who would voluntarily offer his heart so that she can become a true human which leads her to the fateful meeting with the strong ontheoutsideyetweakontheinside disfigured Jing princess and her love interest  the damaged hero Huo Xin.The CGI scenes which might look badly done and painfully fake to a lot of people is one of the important factors attracting me. Just let yourself be forget the reality and get into that fantasy mysterious world. The characters are typical of what people look like at that time  longhaired tough soldiers beauty with big attractive eyes fair skin and hair so long that it can touch the floor flying all over the places beautifully when the wind comes. The movie is totally a feast to the eyes. Stunning visual everywhere from the landscape to the people.And the most important thing that contribute to the success of the movie the actors. Zhou Xun the demon is simply flawless. Whether it's her look or her acting it's simply perfect. Her role is definitely the highlight of the movie. Whatever she does no one can hate her. I can feel the pain in her eyes the sadness hiding behind the mask of a evil demon. That is what I call a true actress. But that doesn't mean Zhao Wei the princess did a bad job. She played her role very well. There's no room for complaint. The reason why I love Zhou Xun so much is probably because her character of the demon in the movie is kind of more complicated and interesting to me. Comparing with those 2 actresses Chen Kun falls a little bit flat. His role is very well played it's just ... flat. However to combine all the 3 we made a powerful trio making the mission to conquer all the box offices in China possible.The plot although I have to say doesn't have much originality is still interesting enough to keep my eyes on the screen. The movie is a heartbreaking love story dealing with the issue of true beauty.Although we all claim that the true beauty is what people possess inside isn't it true that everybody is attracted to a beautiful face in some way?".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Painted Skin The Ressurrection";
	schema:reviewBody "Gordon Chan's Painted Skin back in 2008 had Singapore's Raintree Pictures as a production partner with China born actor Qi Yuwu in one of his many overseas film forays but the follow up film is a purely allChina affair showing off what the Chinese film companies can do in terms of storytelling and effects In all honesty I prefer Painted Skin II over its predecessor precisely because it took its time to tell a proper story contrary to the treatment of many mainstream China made films in the similar genre that had overemphasized less than stellar CG effects and sacrificed story along the way.This is not a sequel nor is it a prequel to the 2008 film despite having to share the same title both in English and Mandarin. Most of the primary cast returned and played totally new characters where you can speak of this as if it's a spiritual companion to the first film challenging the same cast in having to portray different characters in what would structurally almost be the same film except with new themes and characters thrown into the mix complete with breathtaking landscapes that only Western China could offer.In this story the power trio of Zhou Xun Vicky Zhao and Chen Kun return. Zhou Xun reprises the role where she's the temptress foxy spirit Xiao Wei and the primary antagonist of sorts in this story ripping out the hearts of man to devour and maintain her mortal looks. Being cursed and needing to fend off her icy prison she got rescued by Zhao Wei's Princess a royalty with an incredibly strong heart and a partially masked face pining for the love of Chen Kun's General who's at the frontiers to ward off the kingdom's enemies which also serves as a refuge to hide his true feelings for the woman he believes he cannot deserve after being indirectly responsible for the mishap which led to her disfigurement.Most of the screen time and plot development went to these three and the camera just gorgeously captures them all in their romantic dalliances especially when Xiao Wei becomes the de facto spanner in both the Princess and the General's love life no thanks to a little mesmerizing black magic that's cast to help Xiao Wei in her cause to obtain the Princess' heart and become human. Sure it's a merrygoround manner but we learn certain rules of the game where a transformation can only take place should a heart be willingly given up as opposed to forcefully obtained by the demon. And in fact this issue is central and broached more than once in the film.It revolves around the themes of unrequited love sacrifice and the long held belief that we are attracted to beautiful flawless things even if it's something a superficial as a woman's looks. The characters go back and forth in dealing with their emotions and thankfully this served as sufficient back story to their individual characters allowing a multifaceted dimension to them which of course worked wonders for its running time of over two hours. This in addition to the wonderful deliberate visuals that director Wuershan had given this film that the first one didn't possess.Zhou Xun plays it cool this time round as the scheming Xiao Wei who would discover that being human isn't all that easy given that she has had powers easily taken for granted. Zhao Wei continues in her roles as warrior princesses from Red Cliff and Mulan and plays to perfection the role of a woman willing to give up anything to be with the man she truly likes. And with two strong female leads playing opposite him Chen Kun could well be regarded as the current Mr Popular with real acting ability given license to brood most of the time as the conflicted General who isn't too aware that his eyes were stamped and cursed leading him away from and providing him reason enough to stray. The performances of these three together can go on forever.Granted though with the increase in time dedicated for a special effects showcase and an unwavering focus on characters what had to give was the martial arts and fight scenes which pale in scenes if compared to the first film. The martial arts practitioners were clearly reduced and the antagonists in the form of the Wolf clan's Shaman Kris Philips and Queen Chen Tingjia didn't quite provide any real threat save for their sheer numbers of faceless army goons they bring to the fray. Their objective though brings the story full circle with Mini Yang and Feng ShaoFeng's characters as Xiao Wei's bird companion and a bumbling demonslayer respectively were in just to add to star power and for minor comic relief being in tangent subplots that serve little to the main story.Still Painted Skin The Resurrection actually revived some hopes that the Chinese film industry is capable of coming up with visually attractive actionadventures that tap on the Liao Zhai sources if elements in the film were well balanced with an adequate story backed by solid cast members. And having some really sensual scenes in the film didn't hurt it at all given enough of them to highlight the mandemon transformation which was almost extreme FaceOff like but in a sexier fashion. Recommended!".

Acting is great especially by the two leading ladies. This film offers all I need from a fantasy story.It appears that not many in the North America are aware of this film or have seen it.

The hardest thing for me was that Princess Ying Vicky Zhao was supposed to be depressed about her facial scars  hidden by her golden mask. But I find her to be extremely attractive so to imagine her as some horrible ugly thing was hard to swallow. Even when she reveals her mask the scars don't look all that bad. Actually all three main actresses were very attractive and did very well in their respective roles. The only minor complaint would be the wooden performance by the actor portraying the general.

And that just added to the pointless feeling of it the movie.Xun Zhou and Wei Zhao carried the movie quite nicely as they also did in the first movie and they were joined by a talented cast ensemble.Visually this was an impressive and beautiful movie. The CGI and special effects team delivered an amazing experience here. And the costumes and locations also were right on the money being impressive and beautiful as well.This was not the brightest of moments in Chinese cinema. Don't get me wrong though because it is a good movie in itself. Just too bad that it was such a shameless rip off of part one. If you haven't seen part one then the sequel is a good movie. If you have seen part one don't really bother much with part two.".

I agree that some CGI really looked cheap but it fits perfectly in this slow moving love story. But the fight scene's make it watchable and the erotic feeling between the princess and the demon in the bath also makes it watchable. There's no nudity to spot but the scene does give it an lesbian erotic touch. Not only that the acting also is sublime what makes this more watchable. But at the end if you can't understand Asian horror or fantasy then leave this for what it is but if you are open minded for some melodrama then this is your stuff no go eat those azaleas...Gore 05 Nudity 05 Effects 45 Story 355 Comedy 05".

I had never heard of it before yesterday nor its predecessor and I normally shy away from Chinese fantasy that isn't big box office yet there was something in the synopsis that caught my attention. Figuring we could always switch it off if it proved truly awful we decided to take a chance. I'm quite happy we did.First the bad side. The choreography for the fight scenes doesn't make sense half the time in the beginning a man flipping and twirling off his horse because he was sliced by a sword? What? and the graphics are definitely low budget the greenscreen scene by the lake toward the middle of the movie was just wretched. The plot gets so over dramatic at times that it takes away from the story itself the eye thing toward the end was just too much x.x though upon reflection it does make more sense than most fantasy movies these days yes George even one arrow in the shoulder can freaking HURT thank you. The makeup could have been a bit better and I was honestly expecting to see more vulpine qualities in the demon if you know what I mean.Redemption time I feel this movie is such wonderful proof that there are times when the acting and the plot can make up for a whole world of sin. Even when some of the shortcomings were a distraction it was still easy to get drawn right back into the story. The choreography for the fighting definitely improves the scarred princess has amazing moments for this o.o and the choreography for the dancing is exquisite. The acting between the demon fox and scarred princess is stunning at times especially toward the most crucial parts where most actors tend to drop the ball not going to give away spoilers here. You'll see what I mean when you get there. The singing of the demon fox is haunting and beautiful and the demon bird is so much what this movie needed. I also didn't even think about it until toward the end just how much subtle symbolism there is.Down two stars because of how much the movie lacked but if you can get your hands on it and forgive its shortcomings this movie is definitely worth the watch. Now to find the first one!".

According to demon lore there can be no greater heresy. Que'er Mi Yang a cute bird demon finds herself captivated by Xiao Wei's beauty and releases her from the prison remaining by her side as a loyal and faithful accomplice.This freedom though is only temporary for wherever Xiao Wei goes the frozen grave accompanies her ready to swallow her whole once more. By sheer coincidence both demons happen upon Princess Jing Zhao Wei who has fled the palace in order to escape the marriage that has been arranged between her and the Tianlang prince a man she can never love.Wearing a golden mask across half her face which was once disfigured during an attack Princess Jing intends to ride for the White City in order to meet General Huo Xin Chen Kun the man who once protected her. Unable to escape her feelings for him she wishes to discover if the romantic connection is mutually shared. Princess Jing's heart although belonging to the General becomes Xiao Wei's prize its power been able to stopper the icy prison from ever containing her again.With an approaching eclipse it is during this time that demons can swap bodies with humans but only if a heart is offered willingly and Xiao Wei who desperately wishes to become human will do almost anything to win it. But is she really as cold as the prison pursuing her or has she herself softened? The prison however is not the only threat for a demon hunter Pang Lang Feng Shaofeng is present in the city and though incompetent he is certainly no fool to the magic that she wields.Visually Painted Skin The Resurrection is perfect. The costumes are gorgeously decorated while the effects are reminiscent of a dream sequence as are the fights which are epically choreographed. You can't help but gasp in awe at many of the scenes which serenade the eyes with their outstanding execution.Occasionally however the sheer potency not to mention the frequency of the effects feel unnecessary in contrast with the original and though live action and computer generated scenes are bound together over the duration of the film sometimes the story could have been conveyed just as passionately without the continuous use of these features.Moreover the accompanying musical score continuously sets the mood regardless of whether it is a sweeping romantic melody played beside a scene of desirous passion or brazen percussion during a fight sequence. The acting is superb and provides a deep emotional connection between both characters and the viewer the emotion whether it be pain or happiness been flawlessly presented while the script much like the original is beautifully poetic.Over the course of the feature a potential complaint could be that the movie runs for too long. Perhaps but by the time the beautiful conclusion makes its way across the screen you will more than likely be glad that you took the time to watch this magnificent gem. Neither better nor worse than the original Painted Skin The Resurrection is as equally magnificent as the first and fabulously concludes what has to be two of the best films made this century.".

Then there are fights running around from evil guys more fights monkeys hallucinogenic fruit and other such entertaining things.Scott brought some welldone comic relief into the film with his quirky upbeat character. I could not stop laughing when Travis really tries to take on Beck in a contest of physical strength. It's like watching a caterpillar try and beat a Mack truck. Christopher Walken as always is a pleasure to watch.

He's cleancut wellspoken modest etc. Supposedly this film was supposed to be The Rock grabbing the action mantle so to speak from the king  Arnold Schwarzenegger  who will no longer make movies. They even have Arnie make a quick cameo wishing The Rock good luck! That was a good touch.Meanwhile Rock's cohort in this film Seann William Scott gets by with his sense of humor. It almost plays like one of these buddy movies except that these two guys Beck and Travis respectively are not on the same page about anything. In no other film can I recall two characters getting beat up and annihilated like these two guys....but they never seem the worse for wear! Unbelievable!Rosario Dawson adds some female sex appeal and Christopher Walken adds his normal entertaining take on being the villain. His dialog was very good in here. I didn't realize until the second time I watched it which is where I stand now just how stylishly this was filmed. This movie reminded me of many made by either Robert Rodriguez or Quentin Taranatino with the gimmick photography. It makes it all the more fun to watch. Add some excellent sound tremendous Hawaiian scenery simulated to look the the Amazon jungle in Brazil......and you can put up with the stupidness of the story and have a good time.".

I'd never seen a movie with The Rock before or even watched any wrestling so I was kind of dubious as to whether or not he would be any good. In fact he was a great actor full of personality and charisma willing to make fun of himself and was great with the action. The Rock is definitely the next Arnie. Vin Donald Duck Diesel is the next Jean Claude Van Damme.Seann William Scott was also pretty funny in a rare NOT Stifler performance. As an actor he does have genuine talent that's usually wasted in lowbrow teen sex comedies. The Rundown is a sort of Indiana Joneslite movie. The Rock plays a bounty hunterchef who is sent to track down Seann William Scott south of the border. Against his will The Rock ends up on a trek through the depths of the Mexican jungle looking for some ancient artefact. Unoriginal it may be but director Peter Berg keeps it moving with plenty of stunts action and laughs. Christopher Walken's villain is a bit of a cardboard cutout but how evil are you allowed to be in a PG13?I look forward to the next movie starring The Rock. With talks of a third Conan movie I can only imagine him being the best choice. And keep a lookout for Arnie in the nightclub at the very beginning. 'Have fun' is his only line. And fun The Rock will certainly have as the next BIG action hero.Keep a lookout for Scottish actor Ewan Bremner a zillion times the 'star' Ewan MacGregor is in a funny role as a slob pilot.".

	schema:reviewBody "With the demise of box office power for the action man and a loss of interest from the public to watch the badass hero who says little but kicks a lot of butt the kings of the genre Arnold Schwarzenegger Sly Stallone and Willis's careers as action men seems all but over. Van Damme and Seagal were gone long ago. Should the main three want to do mainly action movies for the rest of the careers then they may need to do so in the DTV market. However it does seem like the action movie could be getting a second wind. We have a plethora of new action heroes none of whom will have the staying power of Schwarzenegger and also respected actors who play everyday men like Tom Cruise Matt Damon Nic Cage and Will Smith have turned in their fair share of action movies. The Rock does seem the ideal new action man with his only real competition from wooden pretty boy Paul Walker and the now seemingly cursed to do crap movies Vin Diesel who in truth would be best as a baddie like in Pitch Black.. The Rundown while a box office disappointment has performed well on video but more importantly audiences really enjoyed it's delightfully 80's feel. It could almost be taken from Sly or Arnolds early career. It's not loaded with a hip new soundtrack extreme sports or slick vehicles and loads of special effects merely to lure youngsters in to see it. It's modernised and stylised version of films like Commando albeit much better than that.. The simplistic oneliner laden films I used to love. Throughout the mid to late 90's as audiences got tired of that and a lot of seeming rehashes and Sly and co doing movies very similar to ones they had done before meant that producers tried to give characters to these guys with more depth without getting someone to write it decently and of course in the case of Schwarzenegger trying to give a 3 dimensional person to someone who can't act. Now as for Sly and Willis they have wasted a lot of their career doing action movies because it doesn't stretch them as actors. They are good actors given good roles people forget Stallone got an Oscar nomination. The Rock is more like Arnold. He's limited in his acting chops but has a charm and likeability and a good presence and we can expect no more from him than simple roles where his prerequisite is simply to cause carnage and emote on the odd occasion. I am glad we could see a reinvention of 80's action movies Jackie Chan breathed new life ot the martial arts genre throughout the late 90's and the first years of this decade but they seem to be wearing thin now so it seems some good old fashioned superhuman carnage could be on the cards there's even the possibility of a new Die Hard Rambo True Lies and some new films like Spy Hunter. Even Van Damme and co in DTV land are going back to basics and not trying to test their acting because truth be told for 99 percent of these action stars it's a test where failure is inevitable and it's not what their fans really want. The Rundown is simplistic stuff. You have a simple premise and a setting that is prepped and ready to be blown up. You have a strange mix of central characters with The Rock and Sean William Scott. Meaning there will be plenty of fast jive talking and one liners. You have your thespian in their as the bad guy. Christopher Walken in this case and your ready you have the basis for a good fun action movie. This is great fun. Arnold and Sly would be proud to have this on their CV. In fact it is on Arnies CV because he has a cameo at the start which is effectively him passing the torch on to the Rock. There are no twists and turns of any really note but the important thing is that it is nicely paced it has a nice glossy sheen to the cinematography. There are few hints at them aiming for a particularly young and hiphop or Nu Metal demographic like Fast And Furious or Jet Li's films have done thankfully. It's cool without going over the top and blowing it's wad. I like the fact this isn't made for pimply teenagers first and foremost. It's made for action lovers it's a loving and subtle gift to young adults 20 something's who watched the action films in the 80's and early 90's when they were undemanding untainted fun and far form the marketed tripe we get now. The Rock is good here. He has improved so much from The Scorpion King. He has charisma he's got a natural screen presence and a charm. In fact he's more natural than Arnold with his acting he even has more of a vulnerable side although not that much. I do think that given time the Rock will be better than his sensei. He has after all only just started. He won't however have as high a standard of movies. Let's not forget Arnold hasn't only done good action films but good films and classic movies with the first 2 Terminators. What the Rock now needs is a box office hit. He hit it big with Scorpion King but since then his movies have not been hits Walking Tall being a flop. His next Spy Hunter which sees him team with action maestro John Woo has got fantastic hit potential and potential to be as good as this film. Sean William Scott is also good. He does his Stifler thing again and it's good. It's almost as much to do with how the Rock plays and reacts off him that makes his role funny. Of course Christopher Walken is good and he has a trademark and hilariously intense speech about the tooth fairy that will have you in stitches. Rasario Dawson is also good.The action is great some of the best this year I have to say. It's old fashioned carnage not reliant on CGI. It's imaginative stuff and well thought out as well as being well edited. The Rock is a great asskicker. He performs most of his own stunts and has real natural ability to put on a show with his fights thanks largely to his WWE background. Peter Berg handles the set pieces with poise.This is a highly entertaining flick bringing back pleasant memories and is one of the best action films in years. ".

	schema:reviewBody "The Rock's newest one this weekend and found The Rundown to be quite entertaining.  Sure the plot is nothing to sneeze at but casting Christopher Walkin as the lead villain was wonderful.  He has a very unique way of playing with the dialogue to make it quite funny. Seann William Scott is pretty darn hysterical and plays the second banana well. The impressive find is Dwayne The Rock Johnson's performance.  The guy is getting better and better.  I found his first one The Scorpion King to be fun but not worth collecting.  This one might have to be bought though.  His years of using a script and improvising in front of a multithousand seat auditorium has translated well to the screen and he has a sense of timing and ease in front of the cameras that has been hard won.  He obviously can handle the action aspects of the movie too but as with most action stars I hear he wants to stretch his wings and perform other stuff.  That has the potential to be fine down the line but lets see how he continues with the ActionComedies first.  Should be interesting to see how they do the Walking Tall remake.  The original one was a pretty powerful movie with some seriously tense sequences.Hopefully it won't be changed to much.  Anyway gonna have to give this one 34".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing The Rundown some odd sensation in me suggested that if director Peter Berg had been more interested in surveying his characters in his ultrastinker debut Very Bad Things that he could have had a masterpiece on his hands. With that assumption stated it is hard to believe that The Rundown is one of those rare films that physically pits its heroes above their action. Allowing a story to build around natural causes instead of setting up backdrops in order to initiate planned action sequences.Existing somewhere between a big dumb summer popcorn flick and a sincere alternative staring into the eye of adventure this is a film that is entertaining on almost all levels. We are given assurance to this early on in the film from none other than Arnold Schwarzennger when he tells star the Rock to have fun' while walking down the hall of a nightclub. Having had such a mighty torch passed to him so early on it would be a dishonour to expect anything less than off the wall amusement from the Rock. He in turn gives a performance in Beck that is so crisp and fresh that we believe he has the potential of a hero. Beck works for the bad guys taking jobs that no man without a purpose would ever question. But the Rundown is a good movie and a good movie knows enough that its characters need dimension. Thus Beck is a man who does have a purpose. He is aspiring to open his own restaurant. But in order to get the money to achieve his goal he takes one last job. The job finds himself traveling to Brazil to a small town called El Dorado in order find his bosses son Travis Sean William Scott of American Pie and bring him home not an easy task as the duo quickly develop a strong lovehate relationship.Along the journey we find another layered characteristic about Beck in that doesn't like guns.  You're the only American I know who doesn't like guns' says an onlooker. But he doesn't like them because bad things happen when I use guns.' And from watching Beck in handtohand combat it is not hard to image what life would be like with a gun at his disposal.What follows in the jungle is an action flick that I've already seen in Gunmen and Indiana Jones. But Gunmen was a joke that no one seemed to be in on or maybe it didn't realize it had one but the Rundown does. Making it a lot easier to have a sense of humour about something that sees caricature in itself.  We then encounter a villainous mine owner named Hatcher in Christopher Walken who says all the things that we tend to wonder when unbelievable circumstances are questioned in a serious film. Walken an actor so aware of himself and his purpose that he seems to make even the most senseless dialogue meaningful is given the films single best line. When asked by one of his henchmen if he thinks Beck and Travis are dead after driving off a cliff Hatcher replies what am I psychic.' He later outdoes himself and his character again when after a stampede erupts in the middle of a town he utters impressively that's a lot of cows' while watching a video monitor. But Walken isn't the only key player with something unique to show. Rosario Dawson gives the most curios and understanding action performance from a female since Linda Hamilton stared in the Terminator and the Rock proves that although his acting range may be limited that is no excuse for one dimensional character association. Scott also shows that his smartalecky nature is not just reserved to the American Pie movies.    Then in a near change of pace somewhere around the halfway mark the Rundown changes from a mission of retrieval to a hunt for lost gold and manifests other sub plots involving loyalty and a running joke about sexually active monkeys. Under the conditioning of a movie with the soul intent of an action basis this could have been a problem but because the core of Berg's focus lies in the chemically imbalanced structure of his characters we tend not to make a point of it. The motivations in Berg's direction come in his desire to avoid playing with ideas of violent behaviour. Analyzing his characters and explaining what prompts their involvement in violent circumstances. Making the obligatory action climax seem like more of a reward for good behaviour rather than a setup for no better reason than to follow standards.The an example of this happens in one of the best scenes from an action film I have seen all year in which Beck is tempted into using a gun. In a genre that lives by the motto of shoot first ask questions later.' The idea of what would convince a man of honour to go against himself for the benefit of his temperament is equally as fascinating as it is exciting in its conclusions. The films cinematographer Tobias A. Schliessler also disserves great credit for his masterfully filmed action sequences that at times may also seem like too much but when this degree of care and technique is put into something its a strong tendency not to be bothered with such small criticism.  As a result making for some of the most poetic and electrifying action sequences since Daredevil. Although the Rundown may not be a perfect film overlooking problems in pacing and the neglect of some under developed ideas it is still one of the most enjoyable times I've had at the movies this year. Making me believe that what the Rock is cooking smells like nothing less than a great career as an action star.".

Playing a bounty hunter is definitely a good role for The Rock. He doesn't play around and I think he should thank Martha Stewart for the cooking ideas. Better yet it should the E man Emeril Lagasse. For the voice he lends to the The Rock's character. I liked all the scenes in the movie and even though they were pretty fast paced the fun factor was never lost. Take the jungle scene where all the rebels fight Beck there was a lot of action there. And I think the humor was the backup factor there too. Rosario Dawson provided a lot of quality as well. I liked the part where she gave BeckThe Rock and TravisSeann William Scott some of that funky fruit. And then they had to wake up with the monkeys with what Beck had to put up with earlier in the movie. Christopher Walken was good playing the bad a. It was funny when he had the .44 automatic shot out of his hand and had to choose Option A the hard way. This movie had a lot to give action adventure and comedy. What more do you want? Rating 3 out of 5 stars!".

Not to mention there is a jungle out there...Now before watching this I expected this to be an entertaining action movie with some explosions choreographed hand to hand fights some jokes and oneliners. I was disappointed. In one word one could sum up the movie to Silly. The jokes were silly. Often with some adolescent humor or without any point. According to trivia the lightning and thunderacts were improvised at first but kept in the movie because they were so funny. To whom? I just found them dull stupid and silly. The fights were choreographed enough. Choreographed and defying gravity to the point you could see were the lines were attached to the actors that kept pretending to be superman and flew around. Predictable too at first of course Beck took a beating few would survive but after getting mad enough just stood up and beat the crap out of everyone.So no suspense just a few funny jokes no good fights and actors that can do so much better. That counts for all of them but especially for Walken. However I believe that the major fault is that with the material at hand noone could have done better. And who got the brilliant idea to have Beck and Travis attacked by monkeys baboons I believe from Africa in the middle of the SouthAmerican jungle?

	schema:headline " One hundred and four minutes of sheer visceral enjoyment is what one looks for and finds in The Rundown";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the ideal popcorn movies of recent years has been Peter Berg's The Rundown a highly humorous 2003 actionadventure flick starring Dwayne Johnson back when he was billed as The Rock and Seann William Scott. There is a key moment early in the picture when Johnson is walking into a rough n tough party room and passes Gov. Schwarzenegger on the way out. The governor once the hot muscleman in movies turns to Johnson and comments Have fun. He passes down the torch to the next generation and in just the right movie. Since The Rundown and other early successes of his' he has become a movie icon and deservedly so. He just had to showcase his genuine talents in a great movie. And The Rundown is a great movie. It is 104 minutes of pure enjoyment something we don't find so easily these days.What's even more remarkable about the film is that it accomplishes this without breaking any new ground. It is an oldfashioned adventure tale just brought to life with a modern style. Other films have attempted this and failed. So why does The Rundown succeed? Let's take a look and find out.The movie stars Johnson as Mr. Beck a mob boss's collector who is afraid to go against an NFL offensive line because he doesn't want to hurt them and ruin their chances of winning another championship. Wanting to leave and start his own business a restaurant he gets the final assignment of tracking down his boss's renegade son Seann William Scott who is residing in Brazil. When Johnson gets there he not only has trouble restraining the rebellious and persistent Scott but also faces opposition from a cruel landowner played by Christopher Walken and freedomfighters led by Rosario Dawson all of whom want to get their hands on a priceless artifact hidden in the jungle.Nothing new in terms of plot. And not much else new in terms of story. I think a key element that makes The Rundown a winner is because of its ideal casting. Sure anybody from Sly Stallone to Gov. Schwarzenegger or even a new face could have been cast as Mr. Beck but Johnson not only has the buff and cynical looks but an enormous amount of onscreen charisma that we seem to be lacking in a lot of movie stars these days. Johnson not only fits the role but he plays it extremely well. He's tough but funny at the same time. The jokes are wellwritten but he plays the notes just right. Seann William Scott is also ideally cast in his role. In the hands of a lesser actor or somebody else the smartlipped character might have come across as being nothing but irritation. Scott plays the role like an early Jim Carrey role. Sort of like Ace Ventura if he were a treasure hunter. But he neither overplays nor underplays this role. He finds just the right note in between and produces a very funny and likable guy even if those around cannot agree with us. Christopher Walken has a cutout villain to play but he does so with such scenestealing power that he makes a rather memorable character out of his standardized dialogue and motives. And Rosario Dawson is very well suited for her role. She is beautiful but not smoking hot so that does not distract us. She also plays the role of a freedom fighter with conviction.Another key element to the success of The Rundown is how it chooses to mix both action and humor. But it never overplays one or underplays the other. The action is neither too intense nor too lackluster. By contrast it is very imaginative such as when Johnson fights off a group of men with guns pointed at him using nothing more than the furniture around him. Like Jackie Chan with muscles. There's also great humorous touches such as Mr. Beck's option A or option B speeches. See the movie to learn what I'm mentioning her. And sometimes they blend seamlessly such as a highlight moment which could be called the roll down. Again I don't want to ruin it for you so see the movie.Peter Berg controls every scene in The Rundown and makes sure that it never slides out of the goodhearted oldfashioned tradition of the movies it wants to follow. He knows how to use a camera and does things that the makers of the movies that inspired him could not do because of the technical limitations of their time. The film is continuing a wellrespected tradition that unfortunately seems to have slipped out of public interest. That may be why The Rundown became a real success financially after its theatrical run. It's refreshing to know that somebody's trying. Maintaining what worked before but doing it with a fresh style. This is sheer visceral fun from a competent cast and director. The Rundown is a modernday American cult classic.".

Christopher Walken has a cutout villain to play but he does so with such scenestealing power that he makes a rather memorable character out of his standardized dialogue and motives. And Rosario Dawson is very well suited for her role. She is beautiful but not smoking hot so that does not distract us. She also plays the role of a freedom fighter with conviction.Another key element to the success of The Rundown is how it chooses to mix both action and humor. But it never overplays one or underplays the other. The action is neither too intense nor too lackluster. By contrast it is very imaginative such as when Johnson fights off a group of men with guns pointed at him using nothing more than the furniture around him. Like Jackie Chan with muscles. There's also great humorous touches such as Mr. Beck's option A or option B speeches. See the movie to learn what I'm mentioning her. And sometimes they blend seamlessly such as a highlight moment which could be called the roll down. Again I don't want to ruin it for you so see the movie.Peter Berg controls every scene in The Rundown and makes sure that it never slides out of the goodhearted oldfashioned tradition of the movies it wants to follow. He knows how to use a camera and does things that the makers of the movies that inspired him could not do because of the technical limitations of their time. The film is continuing a wellrespected tradition that unfortunately seems to have slipped out of public interest. That may be why The Rundown became a real success financially after its theatrical run. It's refreshing to know that somebody's trying. Maintaining what worked before but doing it with a fresh style. This is sheer visceral fun from a competent cast and director. The Rundown is a modernday American cult classic.";

So take heed this is a comedy at its best not much adventure and surely not anything worth any awards to mention of.

	schema:reviewBody "Onesentence summary Midnight Run meets the classic Arnie formula in this excellent surprising action movie.ReviewThere's a scene very late into The Rundown where the lead hero decides to go against his shortstanding morals and pick up guns in order to fight for his friends despite arguing that he never would earlier in the movie. Even Santa Claus would pick up a gun to help out a friend! he is told by a loudmouth. Are you saying I'm Santa Claus? asks the hero. The audience laughs at the irony of the situation.The irony of course is that Santa Claus is a jolly old fat man and the hero of The Rundown is a young lean muscular lethal weaponthe exact opposite of Mr. Claus' unflattering universallyregarded image.And in case you need an introduction to The Rock a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson he is a wellknown wrestler son of Rocky Johnson. He is famous for his own unique slamming move and great skills. Obviously I don't know much about wrestling as you can plainly gather from reading my rather short and uneducated bio of the man.But regardless of any of this here he is in this movie. The Rock is Beck a retrieval expert. He is hired by rich people to seek out certain thingspeople objects etc.and return them to the payer. In the opening sequence he walks into a crowded bar filled with football megastars. After politely demanding a ring from one of the husky players he is thrown out of the bar by fellow football team members. So Beck gets on the phone with his boss. Do we have to do this now? he asks. They've really got a chance this year!The answer of course is that he must do it now and what he does is a lot of funhe beats them up onebyone barehanded and using only his fists as weaponsevoking a sort of JeanClaude Van Damme image. Only...better.Prior to this scene Arnold Schwarzenegger stops Beck while he's entering the bar. He tells him to have a good time with the typical Arnie grin then leaves. That's when we realize we're about to have a fun time and it only gets better from there.Beck's newest assignment is to locate Travis Seann William Scott a young man who is residing in the Amazon and is worth a lot of money to his estranged father who wants his son backfor unspecified reasons. Beck doesn't ask questions he just retrieves what he's told to retrievelike a golden retriever I suppose.After making the trip to El Dorado a.k.a. Helldorado Beck finds himself being pursued by Hatcher Christopher Walken a ruthless millionaire miner who owns much of the land surrounding the areaand wants Travis for himself so that he can tell him where an ancient artifact lies.So on the run with Travis and being pursued by Hatcher and his men Beck is left with few options. There's option A and option B. A is leave Travis and return home forget his job and open up a new restaurant he's been saving up for. Option B is confront Hatcher bring Travis back to his father collect his reward and open his restaurant.He does of course choose the latter of the two options.There's a brilliant scene at the end of this movie that sent a strong chill up my spine. Travis is being shot at calling for help and Beck is scared to pick up weapons to defend his friend. The director Peter Berg the former actor raises the tension by splicing together various images at exceeding speed. And then finally they all immediately stop and we see Beck rise upwards in typical slow motion holding two guns in his hands. The audience is quiet and a chill is sent throughout the screening room. We all know that hell has finally been unleashed. After refusing to pick up guns throughout the movie for fear of what may happen to his enemies Beck has turned on his morals and it's time to kick some butt. This is pure action stuff delivered with great expertise and its effect is startlingly powerful.All in all I absolutely loved it.Prior to seeing The Rundown I wasn't sure if I wanted The Rock to be the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. After seeing The Rundown I must say that I don't really mind if he becomes half as good as Arnold. Granted I somewhat doubt if he'll ever become the same box office titan. Arnold was the first of his kind in both bodybuilding and action movies. He's had a lot of pale imitators right down to the muscle men with accents category. He is to this day unrivaled by any muscular action hero. Just like there will never be another Eastwood there will never be another Arnold. But as far as they go The Rock is one of his better imitators which says something.The Rundown is rated PG13 but plays like a good Rrated action movie. It's very good and will not disappoint any action fans that feel that the genre has been somewhat lacking recently. After Terminator 3 and The Rundown though it looks like we may be starting to get back on track after all.As for Beck? I have a feeling he'll be back.4.55 stars.John Ulmer".

Sure he did the Scorpion King but that wasn't a far stretch from WWE Raw all it was was the Rock flexing his muscles. That was until The Rundown made it to the big screen.The opening sequence in this film has got to be one of the best hooks in recent movie history. His cool demeanor confidence and the persona of a closet chef makes this scene awesome. The way he takes out those players is awesome and I like to see guy's like the Rock every now and then kick some Heine.The film doesn't stop being good after the first scene though Sean Willam Scott is better than I thought too. This is definitely not American Pie. He actually displays some Lead Roll tendencies and dishes out humor that isn't at the consequence of the scene.The movie moves into the jungle scene and again even the extra's do a decent job of acting. Of course when you have a film like this the speaking parts are not what you want to watch films like this speak with action and the littletike warriors in the jungle deliver with a punch or a kick! All in all this film is great and it's one I do not get bored watching over and over. Not exactly a movie you want to watch with your girlfriend but not one she will think is completely stupid either.".

	schema:headline " The Rock Knows His Role Here";
	schema:reviewBody "In the year 2000 charismatic WWE superstar Dwayne The Rock Johnson made his acting debut in The Mummy Returns the viewers thought here we go again another wrestling superstar making a fool of himself by starring in another convoluted action film! It's been done! We all hoped he would just simply put on the trunks and just grapple with Steve Austin or Triple H and headline another pay perview. But he didn't let the critics get the best of him. He took himself to other avenues in the entertainment community where his talents were appreciated. He was a guest on the longrunning sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live where he excelled quite nicely as a comedic performer and did well as satirization to near perfection. Then in 2002 he returned to the big screen for another tryout. He reprised his role in The Mummy Returns spinoff The Scorpion King and though not entirely The Rock's fault the script and the movie as a whole was a flop and once again he was the centre of ridicule as another no talent wrestleractor wannabe. But his guest performances on SNL proved contrary if given the right scripting for him to work on. In 2003 The Rock stars in The Rundown which combines adventure mixed in with spectacular comedic elements to it. In many ways it feels like a satirical take on the Indiana Jones films of the 1980's set in the Amazon jungles of Brazil. The Rock seems to be closer at home here as he juxtaposes his knack for comedic smarminess and his ability to excite us with the action scenes splendidly. The Rundown turned this wannabe actor into the real deal. The Rock stars as Beck a bounty hunter who's been assigned to scour the Brazilian jungles to a mining village of El Dorado to rescue the son who's father is the leader of an organized crime establishment. The spoiled stubborn son goes by the name Travis Seann William Scott who at the time was the right person to play spoiled whiny twentysomethings. The head honcho is a guy named Hatcher Christopher Walken who has successfully gain access to his worker's lives by charging them a bundle in cost of living expenses as well as blackmailing them every chance he gets and is not afraid to utilize strongarm tactics. Travis can't escape where he is but also really has no intentions for that matter. He believes there's a treasure nearby with loot that's gregariously sufficient in profit. Hatcher wants his end of the deal too which is why he refrains from shooting Beck and Travis when Beck lures him away through trial and tribulation. This leads to a high octane chase as Beck tries to lure Travis out of the Amazonian jungles with Hatcher's troop not far behind them. To make things more complex than we have thought there are few people who oppose Hatcher and his intentions. Beck and Travis are befriended by a local villager named Mariana who also has intentions of obtaining the treasure as a means to free her villagers from Hatcher's clutches. I guess we needed a human rights diatribe implanted in this action flick but I couldn't care the least. The film was directed by Peter Berg with a script by written by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt is extremely entertaining and vibrant. The verbal jabs between The Rock and Scott are humorous and clever and the fight scenes exhibits just how tough The Rock is as he fends off against his adversaries with ease is high in adrenaline that will approve to action movie aficionados. And what can be said about screen veteran Christopher Walken? This man doesn't care what film he's in whether good or bad? Heck this guy will even perform in a movie gratis if he wanted to. As long as there's some eccentricity implanted into his deadpan delivery. His resume during this period sees him starring in very forgettable films that is inferior to his impressive career of films that he has starred in. But The Rundown may not be an Oscar calibre film like The Deer Hunter but it's still a great film and Walken plays a very prominent role here and if Walken generates more screen time the more entertained I am. His delivery of lines is very poetic almost like as if he knew the script before reading or maybe he's just a naturally eccentric individual. What's refreshing here is that our protagonist refuses to bear any arms due to a horrific experience with them. Besides knowing his size and strength why does he need them? But once the movie becomes gun dependent the timing was well planned. Too many movies feature gratuitous gun fight and it becomes monotonous and mundane. But the gun fights are minimal and only when needed is original. This movie is one that truly unsuspecting pleasant surprise. For those who love action clever dialogue and plenty of Walken this movie is highly recommended for all to enjoy.".

What's refreshing here is that our protagonist refuses to bear any arms due to a horrific experience with them. Besides knowing his size and strength why does he need them? But once the movie becomes gun dependent the timing was well planned. Too many movies feature gratuitous gun fight and it becomes monotonous and mundane. But the gun fights are minimal and only when needed is original. This movie is one that truly unsuspecting pleasant surprise. For those who love action clever dialogue and plenty of Walken this movie is highly recommended for all to enjoy.";

Alas a large debt to the wrong person keeps him in the persuasion business until he's offered a way out. The wrong person has a lunkhead son Scott prowling around the jungles of Brazil. All Beck has to do is bring him back the debt is settled and he'll even through in a restaurant.When it comes to the action sequences director Peter Berg moves things along with blazing quick cuts and intense closeups that rattle bones and get the adrenalin pumping as Beck and Scott face everything from Tarzan ju jitsu with Eddie Reyes who sets The Rock flying like a big beefy whirligig to a pack of scrappy monkeys with really really bad attitudes not to mention a grudge. But Berg also knows when to slow down and let The Rock and Scott play off each other the former with a slow burn the latter with a geekiness that is as pathetic as it is plucky. The Rock and Scott definitely have great chemistry in this along with Rosario Dawson and Christohper Walker. This is a great film from start to finish and its very entertaining and has some comedy also great action sequences and decent dialogue. This film has a little bit of Indiana Jones The Magnificent Seven and Bad boys.".

Along the way things don't go according to plan and the two of them have to fight for their lives.After his brief cameo in The Mummy Returns and the lead role in the forgettable The Scorpion King it seemed that The Rundown would be his first true chance at taking over the action franchise from the likes of Arnold who coincidentally has a cameo in this film. The Rundown does just that shows The Rock in a lighthearted action oriented funny film that showcases his talent as an actor. He's not another Hulk Hogan making movies because he can but he actually has some talent. The guy is fun to watch on the screen and his film career since then has proved so.The Rock get physical in this film all the fights scenes are stylized to the point of exaggeration. This doesn't detract from the film it sets up the viewer for the way the film will play out. The fight scene that uses this stylized violence the most is when The Rock takes on the rebels and Keno from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Can a simple kick really throw him in the air like that just to be kicked again mid air? I don't think so. If you can get pass this style of action then the Rundown will be entertaining. Sean William Scott manages to break out of his Stifler role something he tried to do earlier with Bulletproof Monk. Here he has a better costar to play his comedy off of. Since then he seems to have been hit or miss with his films and continues to star in films with The Rock. Here Scott isn't irritating so that is a plus with the exception of one scene in which he reuses his Evolution joke of making a bird call.Rosario Dawson and Christohper Walken are the supporting players both plays their roles with no real memorable parts. Rosario Dawson is almost completely forgettable in a role that is underwritten and Walken just seems to be doing his own thing which he always does in films. We let him get away with it because his Christopher Freakin Walken. Peter Berg did well with this one he manages to balance both comedy and action very well and the sequences are entertaining to watch. It helps that he has two stars that played well off each other and could pull off the physical stunts required from the roles. The Rundown isn't something to jump up and down about or rush out to see either. It's a film that you can sit down and watch randomly one day and not be upset about it afterwards.".

Dwyane Johnson turns in a good performance as Beck an aspiring chef who takes this last job to bring back the son of his boss. Johnson's very believable as the hero especially in the actionfight sequences no matter how over the top some of them get in the movie. Sean William Scott is just as good as the boss' estranged son Travis who's after a legendary treasure thats somewhere in the Amazon forest. Scott bring much comic relief to the movie as he usually does which balances well between the action drama and suspense. The rest of the cast are solid in their roles including Rosario Dawson Christopher Walken Ewen Bremner and Jon Gries but they're not given much to do. There's also a blink and you missed it cameo by a certain governor I'm sure everyone has heard about. The actionfight sequences are well executed but some of them get unrealistic at times which isn't necessarily a bad thing it just makes you shake your heard saying yea right I don't care how tough you are once and a while but other than that they're still intense and well paced. Overall despite some flaws The Rundown is still an entertaining action adventure comedy thats definitely worth seeing because of the impressive performances by Johnson and Scott.".

I don't mind that a LOT of it was borrowed from other sources because they borrowed from some goodies. It has the treasure seeking pursuing army and slide down a long hill into water from Romancing the Stone the boobytrapped cave from Raiders of the Lost Ark not to mention also shooting in Hawaii and Christopher Walken's character evokes Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness  he even mentions it toward the end the film. The story is woven together with TERRIFIC stunt work and  even before watching the DVD Extra Features  it's quite apparent that Dwayne The Rock does a lot of his own stunts. This is also a very funny movie. I agree with another reviewer who said that Ahnold's cameo was a symbolic passing of the Action Hero torch. It's a terrific example of the humorous action flick and I'll be seeing it again.".

It has the treasure seeking pursuing army and slide down a long hill into water from Romancing the Stone the boobytrapped cave from Raiders of the Lost Ark not to mention also shooting in Hawaii and Christopher Walken's character evokes Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness  he even mentions it toward the end the film. The story is woven together with TERRIFIC stunt work and  even before watching the DVD Extra Features  it's quite apparent that Dwayne The Rock does a lot of his own stunts. This is also a very funny movie. I agree with another reviewer who said that Ahnold's cameo was a symbolic passing of the Action Hero torch. It's a terrific example of the humorous action flick and I'll be seeing it again.";

	schema:reviewBody "All my films have started with an image says director Andrea Arnold. It's usually quite a strong image and it seems to come from nowhere. I don't understand the image at first or what it means but I want to know more about it so I start exploring it try and understand it and what it means. This is how I always start writing. What does the image of a fish tank conjure up for you? On the inside longing to look out is fifteenyearold Mia. Trapped in a housing estate. Trapped in a single parent family. Trapped by people around her she can't respect. Trapped in herself. For being fifteen. She has her own inner world fighting to manifest itself . Fortified by cigarettes and alcohol she can kick in the door of the empty nearby flat. A bare floor. Her CD player. Practice her moves. A better dancer than those kids on the block she just nutted.Mia is quite content to carve out her own double life fck you very much! Never mind she gets caught and nearly comes to grief trying to steal a horse. And social workers don't scare her. But mom's new boyfriend  that could be a pain! A real spanner in the works. Especially when he's so annoyingly nice.Under Andrea Arnold's hand life on this inner city concrete backwater is suddenly very alive. Banalities become beautiful. Like sunlight through cracked glass. Vibrant gritty and riveting but in a way that entertains powerfully. As pulsating and funny as Trainspotting but without the yuck factor. Its momentum is overpowering. We never know what is going to come out of Mia's mouth or where events will lead. Each jawdropping new scene surprises yet seems the result of inexorable momentum. As if that wasn't enough the story mercifully avoids kitchensink drama excessive violence drugs getting pregnant grand larceny car crashes and all the other clichridden devices to which cinemagoers are usually subjected. Tightly controlled Fish Tank attacks with a potent and thoughtprovoking arsenal of storytelling.Andrea Arnold proved she could do hardhitting realism with her awardwinning debut Red Road. Here she excels her earlier efforts but still imbibes many of the verit approaches and senses of discipline that have filtered down from the Dogme and Advance Party movements. Her 'strong initial image' or lack of subservience to more traditional methodology maybe reminds of the devotion to experimental avantgarde cinema taken by artiststurnedfilmmakers such as Steve McQueen Hunger or themeoverstory technicians such as Duane Hopkins Better Things. Michael Fassbender who took reality to new heights as Bobby Sands in Hunger here plays the mystifying and warmly charismatic Connor Mum's boyfriend.Arnold didn't allow actors to read the script beforehand. They were given their scenes only a few days before filming. For the part of Mia she chooses a complete unknown with zero experience. Arnold spotted Katie Jarvis at a train station after drawing a blank with casting agencies. She was on one platform arguing with her boyfriend on another platform giving him grief. However the performance is achieved Jarvis is electrifying. If Arnold wanted a 'real' person for the role this seventeenyearold takes over the screen with raw adolescent power. Says Arnold I wanted a girl who would not have to act could just be herself. Fish Tank will lift you out of your seat and on an unstoppable flight ricocheting against confines of circumstance and imploding a dysfunctional family with its head of hormonal steam. Laugh cry hold on tight. You will need to. I could almost taste the vodka as Mia goes through her Mum's dressing table drawers bottle in hand. I wish all British films were this good.".

	schema:reviewBody "The poet Rumi said A rose's rarest essence lives in the thorn. The thorn is in full evidence in Andrea Arnold's compellingly honest second feature Fish Tank the story of a fifteen yearold girl's struggle for self respect after having grown up absurd in the London projects. Fish Tank a film that is overflowing with life works on many levels  as a look into squalid economic and social conditions in small town Britain as a warning to those who act impulsively and without selfcontrol and as a comingofage story that allows us to experience a genuine sense of character growth. Winner of the Jury Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival the film features an astounding performance from firsttime actress Katie Jarvis a 17yearold who was discovered by the director while having an argument with her boyfriend on an Essex train station platform.Set in a bleak housing project in a working class London suburb fifteenyearold Mia is an angry isolated but vulnerable teen who lives with her boozy mom Koerston Wareing and little sister Tyler an adorable Rebecca Griffiths. Mia has no friends and is dogged by a meanspirited mother who makes Mo'Nique in Precious look like Mother Teresa. Filled with barely controlled rage Mia seems uncertain as to whether she is looking for a fight or for sex. She goes from headbutting a rival on the playground to struggling to free a halfstarved horse tied up in a junkyard while cozying up to the horse's owner Billy Harry Treadway a gentle 19yearold who seems genuinely interested.Dreaming of becoming a dancer Mia breaks into an abandoned apartment and practices her hiphop dance routines alone to borrowed CDs of pop music including California Dreaming the only time when she can feel good about herself. Mia's first taste of something resembling kindness happens when her mother brings home a sexy shirtless Irish lover named Connor Michael Fassbender who works as a security guard Fassbender's performance oscillates between the charming and the shady and we do not know who is real and who is pretend and where it will lead. Mia has more than a passing interest in him revealed by her deep glances and facial expressions.When Connor lends Mia his camera to film her dancing in preparation for an audition she uses it to spy on Connor and her mom making love. One of the loveliest scenes is when Connor carries a drunken Mia from the living room and puts her to bed gently taking off her clothes while Mia pretending to be asleep sneaks an occasional peak and is obviously enjoying the moment. Although Connor's interest in Mia appears innocent from the time Mia cuts her foot on a family fishing trip and Connor gives her a piggy back ride to the car tension gradually builds until it explodes in a seduction that is not only inappropriate but has serious consequences.Fish Tank is a strong and unpredictable film because Mia is a strong though flawed character who refuses to allow her miserable circumstances to control her life. Arnold uses the fierce slang of the streets overt sexual encounters and gritty handheld camerawork to tell an authentic story of adolescence that in lesser hands might have recycled genre clichs provided a falsely uplifting message or offered a sentimentalized view of poverty. That the film opens the door long enough to provide a breath of fresh air once again tells us that life can be governed by what is possible rather than what is reasonable and Fish Tank instead of becoming another sordid study of pathology becomes an exhilarating dance of liberation.".

From Trainspotting to This is England there are always issues of realism and points to convey and with this 2009 appraised release we see more hard drama.The opening sequence follows Mia around the streets slurring and shouting abuse at anyone in her radar and the coarse dialogue and minimal amount of sympathy is staggering. As if you had been slapped this will instantly startle you into realizing the type of environment and lifestyle Mia is living in. The language will give Pulp Fiction a run for its money.Added as an attempt to justify the rural scene of Britain Arnold gets it spot on as everything flows with little adjustment required. Everything is as it should be because everything has been so carefully planned in particular the character development which will have many shedding a tear or two.Katie Jarvis' cold and unappreciative style is spot on for the protagonist and as the film goes through hard fights with families and spending time isolated in a deserted flat we see the emotional desire of Mia. The ambition of becoming a dancer is exceptionally well produced owing to the fact that the background is effectively established. The hard family life Mia is living inspires her to find a way out and her dancing is her motive to break free. This really does work up a treat with twists turns ups and downs and a staggering climax that adds extra spice to the picture.At only 15 the central character certainly has a controversial agenda set for her. From sleeping with random strangers to drinking anything dangerous Mia seems unfazed. Seeing her younger sister drinking beer with her mother in the next room will have mouths dropping.Thanks to this straight forward no messing attitude the plot can move forward and tell the audience of what real life entails and the cultural state we are living in at the moment.Some British films go out of their way to preach such as This is England and Brassed off and whilst that isn't a bad quality the enriching style of this film makes it flow and add extra drama continuously.The scene setting shots are exquisite as if made from a Skins episode without the teen angst. The scene in the car is excellent and not to forget this film boasts an exceptional soundtrack that fits the mood as well as 2007's Hallam Foe.".

Once that is resolved the pace becomes frantic and the consequences that follow are harrowing.The British underclass seems to be Arnold's setting of choice. I am not convinced she is at home here or even that she has spent much time amongst the people she loves to represent on screen. Mia's younger sister especially seems archetypical  a can of beer in one hand a ciggie in the other expletives falling freely from her mouth she does not seem to be anything other than a Daily Mail reader's portrait of Britain's feral kids. Mia also seems to spend 247 in a rage. A more tempered view even a spot of gallows's humour would make this arena more believable. There is a bit of a sneer here from the writerdirector that is distasteful. I am also sceptical about the Katie Jarvis hype  she does well but there is nothing in the role to suggest a trained actress could not have handled it. Of course casting a trained actress would not have generated so much press as the fightingwithherboyfriendattheplatform story....All that is forgiven however for one sequence that is among the most viscerally compelling I have ever seen on screen. It takes place when Mia is at her lowest ebb and decides on an action that is less than halfthought out. It is completely understandable given all that has gone before but connotes Jamie Bulger Soham and a host of other unspeakable acts from the cultural memory. Shot verite style raw and unforgiving the sequence is a masterclass in how to put an audience through an emotional wringer. The building rhythm of a little girl going up and down on a scooter. A ferocious splash in the ocean. An eternity before resurfacing. Even the memory of it has me sweating from the palms. Brave sublime filmmaking.There are other small moments  three generations of women dancing a horse spied from a road  that suggest a mature accomplished style is evolving in Arnold. Wasp was wellexecuted. Red Road I just found incredulous. Fish Tank has subtlety and bombast not always in the right mix but courageously attempted. I will come back to Arnold. Hopefully one day she will turn her scorn on the taxdodging upper class who are equally Britain's trial and shame.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this in the Grand Lumiere theatre at Cannes FF a brilliant experience and a fantastic film! What struck me immediately was the use of natural light in this film. It really had that feeling that you were there and there were none of the typical Hollywood looks to people and sets. It had a very British feel very much in the vein of Loach's Kes.having discovered the story behind Jarvis the female lead it makes the whole performance more astonishing and remarkable. The angry teenager has never been done more convincingly in my opinion even though my daughter can at times be a close second! There must be young hopefuls in drama schools around the country literally gutted that they have devoted their young lives and untold money to this art but been trounced by an absolute beginner in a role she was obviously made for whether she knew it or not.The environment was nasty you could smell the urine in the corridors feel the poverty amongst the residents and imagine the boredom of the children. One thing that did occur to me at the start of this film was that Mia wasn't great at dancing. I first thought that if this was a film about how dancing would save her she would either need to get good quickly or it would be a serious fail.The male lead Connor Fassbender appears early on as another of Mia's mothers' 'pulls' from the local pub or club. The sexual tension is evident from the start but it doesn't stop Mia from rifling his wallet for money within minutes of meeting him! The mother is stereotypically perfect the lush who drinks to excess yet tries in vain to preserve her looks with botox and yards of makeup and bleach. It's not clear what she does but suffice to say not very much particularly in the parenting department.Finally we have Sophie Mias sister. For me she was the comic relief raising the film above total hopelessness and depression with her funny comments observations and innocent ish take on things. It's hard to imagine the words were put in her mouth as they seem so natural. Whilst in Cannes watching this film it was evident that much of the dialogue went over the audiences head. When we heard the obligatory staff dog was called Tennants we laughed out loud but we laughed alone! The film just seemed to tick along effortlessly. The scenes with Connor and Mia where bursting with tension and the inevitable coupling just a matter of time. However there were times for instance the spanking scene with Connor in the bedroom where it seemed that Mia had experienced something similar and it had adversely affected her. It wasn't clear whether Connor represented an abusive father figure who she couldn't help but fall for or whether she was just a curious teenager having seen him and her mother having sex through the door one night.Very difficult to find fault with this film even if you were looking. The performances were believable the camera work although almost exclusively handheld was not jarring and just helped convey the realness of the piece. Lens flares exposure issues focus etc all leant to the genuine feel and put you right there. Even the ending rounded up the film perfectly and I'm glad she wasn't going to win any dancing competitions and get a job in the West End! Great achievement surely the Palm D'or must belong to Andrea Arnold this year for a brilliantly portrayed glimpse of life as an East End teenager in London and for such a little amount of money! 2m".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering how much positive word of mouth it got Fish Tank came and went pretty sharpish in most cinemas  even those in a larger city such as where I live. This was a shame as it meant I had to keep an eye out to eventually catch the film. Set on a council estate things are typically grim and within the first few minutes of the film we are treated to sudden violence and extreme language  all seemingly par for the course rather than being something special that we are witnessing. In this world lives Mia a 15 year old who lives with a younger sister and a mother who appears to be not much older than her. She gets in fights and practises dancing by herself in an abandoned flat near her own. Her life appears to change for the better when her mother gets a new boyfriend who is friendly good fun and is not put off by the sudden aggression that is the signature of life in the family home.Writerdirector Arnold quite impressed me with Wasp a few years ago and she stayed in my memory thanks partly to her shabby treatment at the Oscars where as the winner of her category she had to receive the award in the aisle and do her speech from there  no stage for her however Fish Tank she stays in my mind on the basis of her filmmaking ability. Fish Tank is not a perfect film but there is a lot to praise it for. Socialrealism is nothing new but Arnold really hits the nail on the head from the start and delivers a simple slice of life that is played in the silences as much as it is in dialogue. There is a downside to this and it is one that most viewers will struggle to ignore  the running time. At two hours the film is just about 20 minutes or so longer than it can bear and in all the silences there are frequent areas that feel like dips.This is a minor thing though because the silences depend on the quality of the direction and of the performances  both of which are excellent. Arnold's use of the camera is great  not only in terms of framing shots but also in terms of movement as this is not a static one shot type of film. The best example of what I mean can be seen in the scene where Mia shows off her dancing for Connor the camera is close to convey the small room to the audience but it is also delivered with such tension that you can feel what is happening as much as dread it happening. Of course the performances are key in making this type of thing work and everyone is great. In particular Jarvis is brilliantly convincing  most people can do the accent and the swagger but she captures the heart of the character letting the viewer see it even while keeping it below layer after layer of defence mechanism. She is by far the star of the film and she makes it look easy. Wareing Fassbender and a few others are all good in support but it is always support.The plot of the film is slight in a way but at the same time with the direction and the performances as good as they are there is always something going on and as much as I would have liked it a little shorter I would be at a loss to say what to cut out to make it that way. Fish Tank ends up as a very engaging and gritty drama thanks to Arnold's direction and Jarvis' very strong performance it mostly avoids clich and predictable plotting and the cold grey atmosphere of the whole film makes for a distinctive product. A great British film and very well worth seeing  how BAFTA managed to miss Arnold and Jarvis this year is a mystery to me.".

	schema:headline " Oh Mia";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching this movie felt like a painful yet necessary experience. This is coming from someone who nearly loved the movie. But it's true no matter what you think about it Fish Tank is not easy to watch at times. I'm not saying it's particularly gritty but it just rings too close to home to ignore. We deal with this image every day we see these kids wasting their lives and their talents between grey walls staring into space emptily trying to get away from some shitty family and we see that shitty family living in a piling mess of mediocrity. And after we see this we try to run away quickly cover our eyes and pick a comforting view again.Fish Tank is a love or hate movie I've come to realize. I loved it but my roommate for example hated it. She hated the fact that no character was redeemable in any way and that the plot went nowhere. But most of all she hated the feeling the movie gave her of total and complete alienation. Funny thing that's what I loved about the movie. The atmosphere as bleak and desolate as it was made me appreciate a great deal of small things this movie subtly hints at such as sisterhood the beauty of nature car rides horses and empty apartments. It sounds strange but the movie actually painted a bright image a very bright image of pain.It's not dark and hopeless it's just staggering in its hope which makes it all the more painful. All throughout this movie each character seems to strive towards something. It can be meaningless and stupid to us but to them it's everything. It doesn't matter why they strive. The fact that their attempts all crumble into a jaded sense of hopelessness is of greater impact. Because it doesn't start out with hopelessness and it doesn't end with hopelessness. It's the crushing feeling in between that takes you to a new emotional level. It's the middle of the movie that shows you what real despair can feel like. And to me it felt like a muffled shout. As if Mia was trying to scream but someone had shoved silence in her mouth. From the outside this movie can be about Mia's journey towards a new life not better but still different. But on the inside it can be about the end of Mia's journey into herself. I think it's very important to understand that Mia never wanted a lover in Connor. Sure she thought about him that way and she had an obvious crush on him but she's fifteen she's allowed to confuse feelings and be attracted to handsome older men. But Mia really started liking Connor when he showed kindness and attention. She never wanted to be another girlfriend she wanted to be someone important in his life because she wasn't important to anyone in general. She thought she'd found solace in him and that he would take her away from everything. It's the childish illusion of escape through someone else. It's the disappointment when she discovers he's run away that makes this character so solid for me. Mia is not angry he ran off after sex. And even when she finds out he'd lied all that time and he had another life with his wife and child she doesn't act like the other woman betrayed by a lover. She just feels let down. She allowed herself to hope and she got nothing in return. Disappointing children is one of the worst things adults can do. And Connor does just that making Mia feel like a small child again. I see a striking parallelism between her and his young daughter. She takes Connor's daughter in a fit of rage but she discovers they're both just as fragile. And Mia hates being fragile. She quietly hates the fact that Connor saw her as an attractive girl first and only later as a kid. But I suspect she also hates herself for having caused this shift in the first place for having led Connor through her somewhat innocent flirtations to see her first in a sexual manner and second as a friend. But any guilt she might feel she directs at him for putting her in an impossible position. It's at this point that I understood Connor's failure to be a father figure had become her failure to be a daughter. She feels so disconnected to her mother that all she can do as she leaves her home is to share a last dance with her. She's become a woman in that horrible sense of the word forcing her innocence and inexperience to become weapons and playing on the fact that her status will always depend on her sexuality and this is cleverly hinted at in the audition scene. Despite all of this Mia is still a strong character. She refuses to get naked refuses to be beaten down refuses to give up dancing refuses to let herself get drowned in her mother's world. It's always annoying when teenagers pick 'No' as their favourite word. But in this case her blatant rejection of everyone and everything is not a bratty act of selfsufficiency it's a desperate cry for acceptance for a 'Yes'. In the end what's sad is that she is proved right that rejection would have saved her some unnecessary pain. But the last scene manages to turn this grim conclusion into a doubleedged sword. Rejection would have saved her the trouble but acceptance is still another form of rejection. By accepting to move on she rejects her old life she rejects her mother and she rejects becoming another 'problem kid' in a correctional facility because that's what would have happened had she gone further with her kidnapping. So if we take a closer look are rejection and acceptance much different? No they both require each other for either one to be effective.".

We deal with this image every day we see these kids wasting their lives and their talents between grey walls staring into space emptily trying to get away from some shitty family and we see that shitty family living in a piling mess of mediocrity. And after we see this we try to run away quickly cover our eyes and pick a comforting view again.Fish Tank is a love or hate movie I've come to realize. I loved it but my roommate for example hated it. She hated the fact that no character was redeemable in any way and that the plot went nowhere. But most of all she hated the feeling the movie gave her of total and complete alienation. Funny thing that's what I loved about the movie. The atmosphere as bleak and desolate as it was made me appreciate a great deal of small things this movie subtly hints at such as sisterhood the beauty of nature car rides horses and empty apartments. It sounds strange but the movie actually painted a bright image a very bright image of pain.It's not dark and hopeless it's just staggering in its hope which makes it all the more painful. All throughout this movie each character seems to strive towards something. It can be meaningless and stupid to us but to them it's everything. It doesn't matter why they strive. The fact that their attempts all crumble into a jaded sense of hopelessness is of greater impact. Because it doesn't start out with hopelessness and it doesn't end with hopelessness. It's the crushing feeling in between that takes you to a new emotional level. It's the middle of the movie that shows you what real despair can feel like. And to me it felt like a muffled shout. As if Mia was trying to scream but someone had shoved silence in her mouth. From the outside this movie can be about Mia's journey towards a new life not better but still different. But on the inside it can be about the end of Mia's journey into herself. I think it's very important to understand that Mia never wanted a lover in Connor. Sure she thought about him that way and she had an obvious crush on him but she's fifteen she's allowed to confuse feelings and be attracted to handsome older men. But Mia really started liking Connor when he showed kindness and attention. She never wanted to be another girlfriend she wanted to be someone important in his life because she wasn't important to anyone in general. She thought she'd found solace in him and that he would take her away from everything. It's the childish illusion of escape through someone else. It's the disappointment when she discovers he's run away that makes this character so solid for me. Mia is not angry he ran off after sex. And even when she finds out he'd lied all that time and he had another life with his wife and child she doesn't act like the other woman betrayed by a lover. She just feels let down. She allowed herself to hope and she got nothing in return. Disappointing children is one of the worst things adults can do. And Connor does just that making Mia feel like a small child again. I see a striking parallelism between her and his young daughter. She takes Connor's daughter in a fit of rage but she discovers they're both just as fragile. And Mia hates being fragile. She quietly hates the fact that Connor saw her as an attractive girl first and only later as a kid. But I suspect she also hates herself for having caused this shift in the first place for having led Connor through her somewhat innocent flirtations to see her first in a sexual manner and second as a friend. But any guilt she might feel she directs at him for putting her in an impossible position. It's at this point that I understood Connor's failure to be a father figure had become her failure to be a daughter. She feels so disconnected to her mother that all she can do as she leaves her home is to share a last dance with her. She's become a woman in that horrible sense of the word forcing her innocence and inexperience to become weapons and playing on the fact that her status will always depend on her sexuality and this is cleverly hinted at in the audition scene. Despite all of this Mia is still a strong character. She refuses to get naked refuses to be beaten down refuses to give up dancing refuses to let herself get drowned in her mother's world. It's always annoying when teenagers pick 'No' as their favourite word. But in this case her blatant rejection of everyone and everything is not a bratty act of selfsufficiency it's a desperate cry for acceptance for a 'Yes'. In the end what's sad is that she is proved right that rejection would have saved her some unnecessary pain. But the last scene manages to turn this grim conclusion into a doubleedged sword. Rejection would have saved her the trouble but acceptance is still another form of rejection. By accepting to move on she rejects her old life she rejects her mother and she rejects becoming another 'problem kid' in a correctional facility because that's what would have happened had she gone further with her kidnapping. So if we take a closer look are rejection and acceptance much different? No they both require each other for either one to be effective.";

	schema:headline " Much more than a stereotypical kitchen sink drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Like Arnold's first long feature 'Red Road' 'Fish Tank' is a much more emotionally complex film than its apparent setting  a council estate in Essex and subject matter initially suggests. Both films contain an element of mystery and a revelation which makes us reassess the characters and their motives.Instead 'Fish Tank' confers nobility like the mangy horse chained to a rockupon a stereotype one much mocked by the likes of the comedienne Catherine Tate. Just because Mia appears not 'bovvered' does not mean this vulnerable outsider possesses real human depth.Mia's tragedy is that she is isolated a girl who acts tough but has a clear need for human connection and warmth of any sorts hence her compassion for the chained horse which her selfabsorbed mother cannot offer. Her isolation increases after she falls out with a girlfriend a betrayal which perhaps prefigures a later one in the film that leaves her emotionally bereft.Into her life steps Connor warm attractive  sexy. He cradles her when she is asleep and their connection develops on a visit to the countryside a pastoral interlude. Like the fish they catch Mia suffocates in her loveless environment like Bresson's Mouchette though that film is shot through a religious prism.Mia places her trust in Connor as in her shy visit to his workplace and naively associates sex with intimacy after witnessing her mother  Connor sleeping together. She does form an emotional bond with a local Gypsy lad but appears confused. Towelhead the new film by Alan Ball covers a similar theme though from the view of a young ArabAmerican girl brought up in a restricted environment The erotic tension generated by Mia  Connor's relationship is palpable as well as a growing sense of menace and of things slowly unraveling. However I think when Connor  Mia finally sleep with each other the feeling one gets is that the emotional bond which exists between them has been transgressed. The film is an ironic reversal of 'Red Road' where Jackie  Clyde's relationship changed after they slept together which led to an emotional resolution. Here Mia  Connor's encounter leads to a rupture.In the final Act the film does become melodramatic possessing the unpredictable tension  energy of a Dardenne film The Child but by then Arnold has convinced you with her characters and the depiction of their world.From then on the film becomes a rites of passage where Mia learns bitter disappointment but also forgiveness the final dance with her mother to a rap song 'Life's A Bitch'.Arnold's cinematographic approach is to 'find a distinctive image' from which the story unfolds. As in 'Red Road' the use of lighting is original for instance how street lights illuminate Mia in her bedroom or the fateful night when she dances in front of Connor whose weakness sees him exploit her.I do agree that the final image of the floating balloon was weak a bit of a letdown like the canary flying around the living room in 'Red Road' but like Edith in 'Ghost World' the only way for Mia to survive or outgrow her surroundings is to leave the estate. Like Mia Edith's close friendship with the mature Seymour takes an inappropriate turn when they sleep together another bond transgressed by the wrong step.I look forward to seeing Arnold's next film. The dilemma facing her is whether to take a radical departure and do something completely different or continue filming stories in a similar milieu. Although 'Red Road'  'Fish Tank' share a similar setting both are distinctive and original films. 'Red Road' is probably the more accessible in terms of plot  emotion as 'Fish Tank' covers emotions that are extremely complex and ambiguous Why does Connor feel suddenly so possessive when Mia asks him for money for her  her Gypsy friend at his workplace? In fact why does Mia bring her Gypsy friend to his workplace in the first place? Did she do it to tauntprovoke Connor? The implied sexual rivalry between mother  daughter The incident where Joanne orders a half naked Mia to get dressed whilst Connor sits watching. It is a film shrouded in ambiguity which eventually leads to its fateful encounter and final revelation.".

But I'll try.The main character Mia is actually not unlikeable and a bit pretty but doesn't seem to have a single friend. Not one. And she doesn't seem to go to school. Well perhaps it was a school holiday? Anyway her main problem seems to be that she is very bored. So she goes out to try and cut loose a horse kept by a bunch of pikeys. And she tries some break dancing by herself. And she ends up sleeping with the cheating boyfriend of her mother and then kidnaps his daughter for a little bit.

	schema:reviewBody "The difference between Fish Tank and other recent films about poor girls is its lack of original narrative. Director Andrea Arnold depicts a story that is a glorified retread of nearly every youthintrouble film. It's a recreation of a situation that is familiar to anyone with a brief understanding of what it's like to be poor. We do not see anything uniquely English other than accents and locations. The movie doesn't need to take place in Essex. It just so happens that the director and leading actress live there. This story could be transplanted across the pond or across the world for that matter. It isn't terrible yet it's awfully generic.Fish Tank was filmed in chronological order weekly until it was finished. The cinematographer went for a realistic look by employing handhelds and occasionally long shots. The characters behave naturally given their circumstances but I kept asking myself why I would watch a fictional version of something that would have been better served as a documentary.Precious can at least claim to have been based on the novel Push. Such is not true with Fish Tank. Its blandness is based on its director alone. She even found an actual girl from Essex to play the title role. Maybe had she followed the girl around she was found arguing with her boyfriend that would have been a film worth seeing. Unlike Precious whose life was altered in someway for better or worse nothing happens to the main character this time. She begins the film as she ends it.Mia is a fifteen year old girl who lives in public housing with her very young mother and little sister. She does not go to school or do much of anything girls who age are supposed to do. Her only respite is dancing to hip hop songs and drinking. We have the impression that she doesn't have any kind of satisfying emotional relationship with anyone.Things change suddenly when her mother begins dating a new guy named Connor. He seems to take interest in her and encourages her to reply to a wanted ad for young female dancers. He gives her some music and even takes her fishing. Connor doesn't bother telling Mia or her mother that he's actually married with child. Mia finds out after she sleeps with him and responds by kidnapping his daughter. She returns the kid and decides to move out of her crummy house and live with a friend.Connor isn't a pedophile I think. He is a man who exploits his friendship with a girl not necessarily against her wishes either. The mother even derides Mia for wearing skimpy clothing when Connor is around. The love triangle is made possible by the impossibility of effective communication. Not even Connor is able to decide what he wants with Mia or even with her mother. They could both be his playthings or both his opiates for suburban life. The title may refer the audience as spectator watching these people move about the redundancy of their lives.The movie is told from Mia's perspective and as it is fictional could have taken the sympathies of any of its other characters. I agree that Mia's character is not contrived and delivers a great deal of palpable humanity. And I also agree that I found her character irritating. Maybe the movie should be called latex Paint Dry.Not Recommended".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts out and we are treated immediately to row after row as Mia Jarvis walks about the town picking fights with basically anybody that comes into her path. Quite quickly her home is shown as a small apartment with three women Mia her mother and her sister living too close together for space and too far apart emotionally with alcoholism predominant in all of their lives no matter their ages and little patience for anybody. Mia's mother then brings home Connor Fassbender another in what is inferred as a long line of men only this guy seems kind of nice and actually bothers to reach out to everyone in the family. Of course at this point in the movie nobody's expecting it to be a cleancut family drama with the new man bringing everyone together and teaching the girls how to be family again because Andrea Arnold's tracking handheld camera and cold symmetrical cinematography has already indicated that we're in kitchensink realism territory and Connor's own appearance is suspicious as what kind of simplistic good natured lout would get involved in this family? From there the camera tracks a not unexpected but still personable and engaging story of a 15 year old girls' first romance and her frustrated struggles with her own emotions.Considering the dancing and the videotaping as part of the subject of the movie there is a hint of autobiography in this movie from director Arnold though in what comingofagestory isn't? Of all the random movies this reminded me of I was actually thrown back to Walkabout Nicolas Roeg's own comingofage story that also featured a girl and her growing emotions and sexuality though in a completely different environment. The reason why I felt such a similarity is mostly because in both movies the characters are in positions that can get them very very hurt but they manage to survive and strive through all of it. Here it was actually refreshing that Mia did not end up raped mutilated or overdosed on something considering that these days directors seem to like to throw in such things as gritty realism when sometimes people are perfectly capable of fending for themselves thank you very much. Mia is precocious but has enough sense of selfpreservation to know how to keep herself safe. If anything her real problem is opening up to people. This is a much more dynamic and interesting story.Michael Fassbender is certainly making himself popular these days what with his roles in Inglourious Basterds Hunger and this. Here his greatest feat is maintaining sympathy as a man who really is a good guy despite the fact that he gives away to immorality and abuses his position or as an immoral man who manages to understand that what he's doing is wrong and he needs to stop from the path he's taking whichever way you want to look at it. The point is he is a very realistic character and is neither a hero nor a villain and what makes Connor's relationship with Mia so interesting is that they really do reciprocate a need for each other it's just that Connor understands he cannot do it and Mia refuses to see the reason why. Again much better than a Lifetime Network special where Connor would have just taken advantage and abused Mia and that would be that. Feelings are more complicated here.PolarisDiB".

Mia is at that stage of development that's cynical sullen and insulting so she's been thrown out of school and is waiting for admittance to a kind of reform school.

Fassbender seems like a niceenough guy. He's quiet generous friendly. But Mia her hormones aboil is silently attracted to him  at least we can assume so. It's never very explicit. One night when Mom is passed out Mia demonstrates her slinky dance for him and he responds like any normal man. He's all over her. But he doesn't force her because he doesn't have to.The incident leaves Fassbender filled with guilt and he moves out. Mia goes to considerable trouble tracking him down and comes close to doing him and herself real harm until she manages to shrug the affair off.I can believe this was written and directed by a woman because it's all about the texture of relationships and the knotty problems they present us with. I don't mean that as a negative comment. The film may reflect female interests more than male ones but it's refreshing to see a movie about people who are screwed up but could be found on the sidewalk. If this had been directed by a man about a troubled adolescent boy it might have been full of guns bashings and busted snot lockers.At that though it moves a little sluggishly. We're interested in the characters but the movie does go on and it could have used some pruning in the editing room. War and Peace needs to be long. Fish Tank could have been shorter.The movie belongs to Katie Jarvis and she's not bad. She has a small frame and although she's thoroughly nubile she retains the flatbreasted gangliness of her growth spurt. She's moderately attractive and it's a nice touch that once in a while the script gives her a chance to get drunk and show some happiness. It gives her a chance to demonstrate that there's more than one note on her instrument. What she lacks  what I presume she is SUPPOSED to lack  is feminine grace. She's not a dancer. Her moves are clumsy and inept and when she doesn't get the job it's just another disappointing childhood fantasy that she must come to terms with.It's not a masterpiece. It's not that ambitious.

It appears to be loaded with a lot of subtext and symbolism...it's not something that was knocked off in a hurry.Yet for all the care and passion that undoubtedly went into its production I just couldn't connect with it which I found odd. Yes I'm American but I always have found Mike Liegh's films to be very compelling so I'll try to describe what I found it lacking by way of comparison.Take Leigh's Naked and compare it to this film. Most of the characters in that film are extremely unlikable. It's by all accounts a brutal grim and depressing film Fish Tank is probably the lighter of the two. Yet I found the characters in Naked to be very compelling because I felt Leigh exposed them gradually. You couldn't predict their every move and motivation. I found almost all the characters in Fish Tank to be quite simplistic in comparison. Mia wants to be free. She wants to dance. She hates her home life. She's in love with her mom's boyfriend who has a VERY predictable secret that he's hiding.And that's my real problem with this movie the script. It follows a somewhat similar arc to Leigh's film even though the characters are nothing close to being similar. But Leigh's characters are compelling and their journey is compelling. There is nothing in Fish Tank's story or characters that we haven't seen in similar comingofage movies many times before. If you take issue with this comparison try Karen Moncrieff's Blue Car  it's almost idenmtical to Fish Tank but the characters are a bit less blackandwhite and offputting and that helps lift the story into places Fish Tank never gets near.Without dimensional characters and a good story the tawdry ugliness of this picture seems to exist for no other purpose than to shock the way Larry Clark's Kids did when it was released. The scene of the 9 year old smoking a cig with her friend in front of the tube made me think of Clark's film and the bathtubjoint scene. But by now these kind of shocks are a bit pass.The off the wall reception this film has received is what stymies me. It almost appears as if Andrea Arnold was following a recipe for a cuttingedge raw slice of life. It's well made yes but it's none of the above.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anleitung zum Unglcklichsein or The Pursuit of Unhappiness is a German Germanlanguage movie from 2012 which means it has its 5th anniversary this year. The director is Sherry Hormann and she is also the one who wrote the screenplay based on Paul Watzlawick's book. I think I heard that the book got pretty rave reviews but if it did then little quality managed the transition from page to screen unfortunately. There are some okay moments and quotes that give a deeper insight into life and love like the question about how one can love  be loved if she does not love himherself. But there are far from enough memorable aspects here and for the most part it is just another pretty forgettable and clichd German romance comedy movie. The scene with the women in bikinis at the workplace is just the perfect example how shallow it all is eventually. The parts about serious subjects like death obviously try to set it apart from the mass of Schweighfer etc. films but it is not really working out at all. I was kinda lucky this is such a short film at only slightly over 80 minutes as eventually nothing stays memorable except the question with whom she will get together eventually and the ending also has that uneasy feeling of being a forced happy ending for the sake of making audiences happy instead of delivering realistic storytelling.The central character is played by Johanna Wokalek and I believe she is a pretty good actress. Her talent was wasted here for sure and this is especially disappointing as she is far from a prolific actress so it would definitely be nice to see her in better work if she only appears in new films that rarely and focuses on stage performances instead. Anyway the cast includes more known names like Berben Mller Schubert Kross Sadler Vogler or Gwisdek but none of them really leaves a lasting impression especially not Gwisdek who is once again the exact same as in all his performances. Anyway I may be biased here as I always thought him as overrated. Then again the other actors I mentioned aren't really any better. As a whole nothing about this film stands out and I give it a thumbsdown. The title is pretty pseudoimportant as well but eventually as empty and uninteresting as the film itself. Not recommended even if it is just a weak film not a disastrous one.".

He has got fair hair and blue eyes and looks like an angel but is not as he also has a prodigious knack for getting into trouble. Emil is not malicious but does not think about the consequences of his actions. For example he gives away food  which is meant to be dinner for relatives who will soon come to visit the family  to the poor because in his view they need it more. Every time Emil plays a prank he escapes his father by locking himself in a tool shed. This is not a severe punishment for Emil who likes sitting in the shed and takes to carving a wooden figure during each of his stays. He eventually accumulates 369 of them save for the one his mother buries because she claims it looks too much like the rural dean.His parents are Anton and Alma Svensson Ida is Emil's little sister  a very wellbehaved child unlike him. She has tried to pull pranks like her brother since she wanted to go to the shed which she thinks is cozy but she failed. His father in particular is often angry with his son though it has been seen many times he still likes him a lot when he does not make pranks. His mother however adores her boy and tends to say Emil is a nice little boy and we love him just the way he is. She also writes down every bad thing Emil does in a blue book although that blue book expands to several blue books. Alfred is the family's farmhand and Lina is their maid. Alfred who is very fond of children is Emil's best friend whereas Lina dislikes the boy. She is in love with Alfred and pesters him with her wish to marry him a subject which Alfred tends to avoid.Emil's father is portrayed as a very typical inhabitant of Smland  for example he does not like spending money. In Sweden this is regarded to be characteristic of people from Smland. Church is very important and the priest is a regular visitor. Alcohol and swearing are strictly forbidden in the Svenssons' house. The books give a vivid impression of Swedish farmers' daily life in the beginning of the 20th century.".

I add this as another one in the list. Considering this one wasn't great I don't think I will bother to watch its 2 sequels. Like the majority of the other Swedish movies I've seen so far this one is well filmed with beautiful and natural nordic scenario but lacks a decent plot. It was a rather boring film with a few good moments but that's it. Besides it became annoying to constantly hear Emil's father angrily yelling EEEMMMIL! Emil is very cute. Despite his angelic face he is lively carefree and a prankster by nature. He doesn't do things for bad though. Like Dennis the menace in the 1993 film he is a good kid he just accidentally does mischief. The little girl Alma is just as cute but better behaved. Emil and Alma are very well played by Jan Ohlsson and Emy Storm respectively.The kids's father is portrayed by a regular actor in movie adaptations of Astrid Lindgren's books. That actor is Allan Edwall a great Swedish actor.Cinematography as I said is great. The farm scenario is another great help gives it visual appeal and charm. The action takes place in the district of Lnneberga in Smland Sweden.Something that wasn't very pleasing to see was Emil getting his head stuck in the soup bowl. Twice to be precise. But at least in the 2nd time they solve the problem immediately while in the 1st time it takes time to think of measures which makes it all the more disturbing to watch.".

But at least in the 2nd time they solve the problem immediately while in the 1st time it takes time to think of measures which makes it all the more disturbing to watch.";

Freddy Heflin who was always admired by the New York cops wanted to become one but because he was deaf in one ear this prevents him from achieving his goal but has become sheriff of Garrison. Recently there have been a dark omen surrounding the NYPD and Freddy is now investigating on this case then Internal Affairs officer Mo Tilden is also on the case and asks Freddy for help but Freddy could not. Now Freddy suspects that a New York City cop named Ray Donlan might be one of the many cops who is corrupted by the mob and other criminals. Now Freddy must find a cop who is nicknamed Superboy who can testify against Donlan and protect him before Donlan finds Superboy and kills him.";

	schema:headline " Finally a role that shows Stallone's true talent";
	schema:reviewBody "Many people see Silvester Stallone as just another action movie hero who can't do anything but that. However unlike other action movie stars Schwarzenegger Van Damme Seigal etc.. Stallone made his breakthrough with a movie that wasn't really an action movie at heart. He gave forth an excellent performance in Rocky and set a standard for himself that just seemed to fall and fall as his career progressed. He starred in cheesy action movie role after cheesy action movie role until finally people began associating him with nothing but that. Now finally over twenty years after Rocky Stallone comes back and shows people that he can be more than an action hero if he wants to. Stallone's performance in Cop Land shows vulnerability anger admiration fear and many other emotions that were rarely present in any of his movie except Rocky. I'm sorry to say that I was one of the many people who took Cop Land for granted when it came to theaters simply because I didn't believe Stallone could do anything but cheesy action movies. Today I finally rented it out of pure curiosity and was shocked at how far I was from the truth.Cop Land is a very well made film about a small town that corrupt New York City cops have made their haven. Stallone plays the sheriff of the town Freddy Heflin who wanted to be NYPD but couldn't due to a hearing disorder. When Murray 'Superboy' Babitch Michael Rapaport shoots and kills two drugged up teenagers when he mistakes a steering wheel club for a gun in a high speed chase his friends come in to help him. But their farfetched plan starts to come down on them when Moe Tilden Robert De Niro from Internal Affairs begins investigating Superboy's alleged suicide. Things begin to go seriously wrong from here and Freddy is caught right in the middle. I thought that Stallone would have been upstaged by all his great costars like Harvey Keitel Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro but I was wrong. Stallone comes out perfectly as an aging cop with smashed dreams faced with a moral dilemma he doesn't know how to solve. In many ways he idolizes these big time New York cops but he knows that many of the things they do are wrong. In many ways Stallone's performance is far superior to that of his costars as he exhibits more depth and character development than any of them.Cop Land is a somewhat unknown gem that many people overlooked for the wrong reasons. If you have any interest in the genre I would highly recommend it. Cop Land is probably the second best police murdercrime drama I've seen only behind L.A. Confidential. At times the story has something to be desired and unlike L.A. Confidential is drags in some parts but the fantastic performances by every cast member more than make up for these minor flaws. I give Cop Land 8 stars out of 10.".

I think this is a showcase for great actors in an aboveaverage script with excellent directing. This is not a Stallone film other actors could play this part but he plays it to a T. Keitel is fantastic as usual De Niro and Liotta are okay. The subplot between Stallone and Sciorra Freddy who once saved Liz from drowning when he was a kid but he lost his hearing in one ear as a result and could never join the NYPD  that's a powerful subplot that could have been more fully explored but only at the expense of the main plot.

His name is an easy target even to the most ignorant ones they immediately put him under the 'action movie' label like Arnold or JeanClaude. What people forget or don't know about is that Stallone differs from all those action movie actors in that he turned into this icon we all know by making a series of really bad choices. Do you know that Sly's the one who wrote the script of the Oscar winning Rocky? Do you know that because his face is half paralyzed from birth he speaks in that weird way that some people find difficult to understand what he's saying and always joke about it? Do you know that he was paid only 60.000 for his acting in Cop Land while he had to gain 30 pounds for his role?To me Cop land is the kind of movie Stallone should have made after First Blood. The director knows what Sly's really capable of so he gives him this role of the cop that is so fair and just but inside him a burning past lives on. He's a hero and because of that he's lost half of his hearing to save the woman he loves but she went on to marry another man. He can't be promoted because of his hearing and while he wants to stay integral he has to face the deeds of his fellow police officers.The movie showcases the struggle of a man to overcome his past the temptation of corruption and the triumph of one's will to remain true to what he believes in. The final sequence is similar to the one's of The Unforgiven or Taxi Driver and it provides a hymn to the human spirit. Stallone's perfomance is unforgettable and he should be nominated for an academy award. Do you think that it's an accident that his performance overshadows De Niro's and Keitel's appearences?I believe that if Stallone did a movie like that right after his first 2 triumphs he could be leading a career similar to the one of De Niro's. But unfortunately to all of us Sly's only capable of throwing hand grenades. Right Leonard Maltin?".

	schema:headline " One of the greatest movies ever made w one of the best casts ever assembled";
	schema:reviewBody "Seldom does a cast story and location come together so well as it does in this film. Sylvester Stallone plays a meek and mild sheriff whose small town located across the GWB from NYC is primarily populated by NYPD cops who took advantage of an administrative manipulation in order to live outside the city limits. In order to do this they opened their precinct up to the mob enabling the mob to obtain drugs seized by the cops in return for lowinterest loans to buy otherwise unaffordable housing in the serene town of Garrison New Jersey. The ring leader of the corrupt cops is Ray Donlan played w admirable frankness by Harvey Keitel who was once a noble officer but now serves as the main conduit between NYC mobsters and the precinct he serves.This film's message is a stunning encouragement to garner the courage to do what is right despite the risks involved. Robert DeNiro in his best supporting performance as an Internal Affairs agent is the catalyst that inspires Stallone's Sheriff Heflin who has long admired NYPD but cannot join their ranks due to partial deafness to take a good look around him and bring down his amoral benefactors before they end the life of a fellow officer. Ray Liotta is brilliant as a morally bankrupt undercover agent whose internal struggles between loyalty to his own interests and the memory of his dead partner killed by a member of Donlan's network keep him at bay until realization of his own demons enable him to risk all and aid Sheriff Heflin in his newfound quest.This story unfolds against the backdrop of a modernday dilemma faced by city cops  should they be forced to live in the crimeswamped cities they serve or should they be enabled to live elsewhere for their own safety and the safety of their families? Also this film admirably addresses the personal dilemma faced by public servants like Freddy Heflin  should Heflin whose eternal dream to become a cop was granted to the furthest extent possible by Donlan's gift of a sheriff's position sacrifice his own wellbeing by doing the right thing and turning on Donlan and co. or should he continue to quietly serve as a member of Donlan's nefarious network? Perhaps the best scene in the film is not even found in the original version but rather the Special Edition Director's Cut where Stallone and Keitel have a confrontation at the Four Aces the local pub exclusively reserved for Garrison's NYPD pop.. Stallone exhibits his disgust and dismay at the true nature of Garrison and Keitel barks Who the f do you think you are? Stallone replies The Sheriff of Garrison New Jersey. The climax and finale exhibit not only the costs of sacrificing one's comfort for what is right but also the rewards.".

Sylvester Stallone who I've never thought was much of an actor gives the performance of his career  a performance that deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor. Incredible. I owe the great Stallone a big apology for not seeing his gift of acting before now.Everyone in this film including Robert DeNiro Harvey Keitel Janeane Garofalo and Ray Liotta gave stellar performances as well. I guess paying all the actors just scale brought the best out of everyone. Why this modern day High Noon doesn't have a higher rating from the IMDb voters like me is way beyond my comprehension. Cop Land deserves at least inclusion in the Top 250 films. Perhaps this cut that I just saw is much better than the original theatrical release.".

Distributed by Miramax Films it features a musical score by Howard Shore.Freddy Heflin Stallone is the sheriff of Garrison New Jersey. A small satellite town across the river from the Big Apple where many of the big city cops reside. Freddy always wanted to be a big city cop but due to partial deafness was unable to make the grade. But when a hero white cop shoots dead two black youths it sets off a series of events that make Freddy realise that the big city cops in Garrison aren't as honest as he is. Thus Freddy must decide if he should get involved.It was heralded as the film to break Stallone on to the A list of serious actors and the film where a fine ensemble had gathered and worked for a basic scale wagesuch was their faith in the material. Yet in spite of making a considerable profit at the box office and receiving generally favourable reviews Cop Land seemed to vanish without trace before it could make its mark in the copdrama genre. A lot of that can probably be put down to the sheer weight of expectation considering the cast involved for something out of the top draw. However revisiting the film now over ten years post its release Mangold's movie shows itself to be the tight and intelligent picture it is.From the off it's evident that there's very little good about the town of Garrison. The coppers drink and drive cheat on their partners and the sheriff looks like an out of work overweight slob. Mangold clearly is more about the bleak than the beautiful. As the narrative and characterisations move forward a multitude of strands start to dangle on the screenwhere it at first appears a bit too chockedbut ultimately unfolds with ease as the story progresses. Here's where Cop Land excels it could so easily have just been another good copbad cop movie one where the doofus partially afflicted guy saves the day. But Cop Land is more intimate in detail of its characters intimacy that is boosted by a pretty flawless cast notably Stallone  Liotta. There's healthy helpings of action and drama but it's the dialogue driven confrontations that entertain the most where we get the pleasure of watching acting heavyweights battle for supremacy.With a slow burn sense of doom hanging over it from the off Cop Land very much feels like a throwback to the adult westerns and film noirs from the 1950s. There's nothing wrong with that of course in fact it's a compliment. But this deserves its own little niche that of the contemporary crime thriller with urban western overtones. A damn fine film with a great thoughtful script that is acted accordingly and directed without flab and pointless filler. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie when I first saw it in 1997 in the theaters and I have recently bought the DVD.  I still love this movie.  This is definitely one of the most underrated movies of the 1990's.  Stallone puts in a really understated and sympathetic yet still powerful performance as an outofshape halfdeaf sheriff of a sleepy New Jersey town populated almost entirely of corrupt NYPD cops.  The cast is magnificent with such powerhouses as Harvey Keitel Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta.  Liotta especially is superb as a cokedout morally ambiguous former righthand man to Keitel who is trying to get out of this circle of corruption. I realize that many people have found the shootout ending to be a tad distasteful but I argue that it actually fits the movie quite well. Stallone's Heflin character is by no means a Sherlock Holmes.  He is a simple man with a heart of gold caught in a very tough situation.  He doesn't have the brains nor the resources to solve his problem with a brilliant plan  but he's got balls and most importantly he's got heart. His solution is direct and unfortunately dangerous.  The fact that he is going to butt heads directly with the corrupt cops in his town is inevitable.  Much like Billy Bob Thornton's character in the movie Sling Blade we are expecting it. We are hoping for it. Absolutely powerful and thrilling.  I heartily recommend it to everyone who also enjoyed movies like Goodfellas and Serpico if just to catch the topknotch performances by Stallone DeNiro and Liotta.".

As Babitch enters the bridge he's sideswiped by a car with two cokeheads that almost upends him. Moving along side the outofcontrol car one of the occupants pull out what looks like a shotgun it turned out to be a steering wheel club. As Babitch hits the breaks the car speeds away only to get blasted by Babitch from behind killing the two in the getaway car. As the police and ambulance crews come on the scene they find that the two who Babitch shot dead were unarmed and that he may well be not only thrown out of the NYPD but have to serve time for homicide which cause Babitch to get very emotional. Before you know it he jumps to his death off the bridge or did he? His body was never found. Speeding through the town of Garrison the next day NYPD policemen Ray Dolan  Jack Rucker Harvey Keitel  Robert Patrick are stooped by the towns Sheriff Freddy Heflin and his deputy Cindy Betts Sylvester Stallone and Janeane Garofalo. After Deputy Betts is given a lecture by the two cop on how she should be out looking to arrest criminals not giving tickets to fellow cops Freddy lets them leave without being ticketed. As the car drives away Freddy notices that the dead Babitch is in the back seat and that he's very much alive. Police corruption and murder is the main theme of Cop Land with a cover up of a cop's suicide that unearths all the dirt that was swept under the rug in Garrison and in the 37th precinct over the last ten years. Financing the three seven precinct's cops houses in Garrison with low or no interest loans and the forgiving and forgetting about paying them off had the entire precinct working for the mob. Thus allowing the mob to push drugs and launder the drug money within it's the three seven precinct jurisdiction.Not believing that Babitch is dead Interanal Affair let. Moe Tilden Robert De Niro starts to put the heat on the cops who are sticking to the story of Babtich sudden demise. Tildon starts to make some headway in the case which makes Donlan  Co. very nervous. They realize that they have to provide a body for the police investigation of Babitch's death to close the case. That body was to be that of Babitch himself! Top notch police drama with Sylvester Stallone giving the best performance of his career as the sadsack Freddy Heflin. Freddy because of an ear injury couldn't make the grade as a real cop and always looked up to the men of the three seven as his hero's. That's until he found out that they were anything but. With Babitch on the run after Dolan  Co. tried to murder him Freddy finds him hiding in a water tower with FiggysRay Liotta another cop from Garrison providing him with food and water. Friggy's also has it in for Dolan and his fellow corrupt cops for the murder of his partner Glenn Tunney three years ago. Tunney was about to talk to a grand jury about police corruption and was mysteriously found murdered in his prison cell before he could testify. Figgsy correctly suspected it was Dolan who had Tunney done in. Freddy realizing that he has to talk to let. Tliden about what he knows but is told that the investigation was shut down by the mayor due to the pressure of the NYPD union. Which was ironic since the fact that it was Dolan and his fellow cops attempt to murder Babtich that made Freddy see the light! In the end Freddy had the whole bunch of dirty cops gunned down in a wild shootout. Freddy pull it all off with the help of Figgsy in a High Noon like shootout on the up until then quite streets and crimefree and peaceful Garrison NJ. It turned out that if the criminal cops just waited another day or so they would have gotten away Scottfree with no one like Sheriff Freddy Heflin being motivated to uncover their criminal actions. The movie Cop Land was a bit uneven and some of the plotlines just didn't tie all the loose ends in the film together. The acting especially that of Sylvester Stallone more then made up for that and that's what makes Cop Land one of the best movie about police corruption ever made.".

Freddy because of an ear injury couldn't make the grade as a real cop and always looked up to the men of the three seven as his hero's. That's until he found out that they were anything but. With Babitch on the run after Dolan  Co. tried to murder him Freddy finds him hiding in a water tower with FiggysRay Liotta another cop from Garrison providing him with food and water. Friggy's also has it in for Dolan and his fellow corrupt cops for the murder of his partner Glenn Tunney three years ago. Tunney was about to talk to a grand jury about police corruption and was mysteriously found murdered in his prison cell before he could testify. Figgsy correctly suspected it was Dolan who had Tunney done in. Freddy realizing that he has to talk to let. Tliden about what he knows but is told that the investigation was shut down by the mayor due to the pressure of the NYPD union. Which was ironic since the fact that it was Dolan and his fellow cops attempt to murder Babtich that made Freddy see the light! In the end Freddy had the whole bunch of dirty cops gunned down in a wild shootout. Freddy pull it all off with the help of Figgsy in a High Noon like shootout on the up until then quite streets and crimefree and peaceful Garrison NJ. It turned out that if the criminal cops just waited another day or so they would have gotten away Scottfree with no one like Sheriff Freddy Heflin being motivated to uncover their criminal actions. The movie Cop Land was a bit uneven and some of the plotlines just didn't tie all the loose ends in the film together. The acting especially that of Sylvester Stallone more then made up for that and that's what makes Cop Land one of the best movie about police corruption ever made.";

Here are all of the wellknown stars in the riveting thriller Cop Land. If you don't know their names you sure will know their faces. Movies with this many stars are bound to be good and this follows that rule. But the many stars is just icing on the cake.Many people dissed Cop Land for having too many subplots and the regular plot to be too complex. Tell me isn't that what made LA Confidential so great? Isn't that why The Matrix was a scifi masterpiece? Wasn't that Hitchcock's favourite thing to do? Let me say IT WAS! The general story is a halfdeaf Sheriff in a New Jersey suburb named Freddy Heflin Stallone is always respected by his peers and residents of the town which mostly consist of NYC cops. When Officer Ray Donlan's Keitel nephew Murray Superboy Babitch Rappaport kills ignorant speeders and commits suicide Internal Affairs' Moe Tilden De Niro assigns Freddy to the case as everybody knows the suicide is a hoax. Freddy doesn't think much of it until he discovers the truth about his friends and the whole town. Freddy wants to uphold the law but is fairly warned by his loyal and somewhat crooked friend Gary Liotta. I know that what my summarization is long but it is no different than any movie I mentioned earlier in this review. Cop Land is Sylvester Stallone's comeback performance. He never left he just got on a string of dumb action movies and was losing touch in the later Rocky and Rambo movies. Before Cobra everybody knew Stallone to be a great actor. The days of Paradise Alley FIST Rocky and Lords of Flatbush proved that Stallone was destined to greatness. He did get popularity and lots of movies but poor reception after becoming a sellout. Cop Land was to show the world that Stallone has not lost his touch in acting and that he can still act like he did twenty years earlier. Of course Rocky is his best role and performance but his role as Freddy Heflin in Cop Land is right behind it. Nobody could have played Freddy Heflin better. There's no wisecracks or cheesy looks or anything that Stallone usually has. He is a confused and determined cop whose life is in great danger. In fact he was so good he deserved an Oscar nomination. 1997 was a very competitive year for movies but I'm saying that he deserved a nomination. A nomination for acting's greatest prize is almost as good as the actual win.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is rare for people to step out of their comfort bubble. Even actors for as successful as they are they too suffer from breaking what they are comfortable at performing in. Here's a film that not every Stallone fan might see everyday  similarly to that of The Truman Show 1998 a year later with Jim Carrey. This particular role is so far in left field for Sylvester Stallone that it almost seems like the wrong choice. When in fact it proves that Stallone by far can still back a punch even when he's not pulling a trigger every five minutes.Stallone plays Freddy Heflin the Sheriff of a small town in New Jersey called Garrison. All seems fine and well with the town and Freddy himself until an incident occurs on the George Washington bridge that connects the New York and New Jersey police departments. After the problems arise Freddy is challenged on his thoughts and beliefs that he had never considered before. This is where things get interesting and dangerous simultaneously. As time goes on Heflin begins to dig and as he digs he discovers that everything is not as he thought.The writing is something to behold here. Directed and written by James Mangold the same man behind Walk the Line 2005 310 to Yuma 2007 and most recently The Wolverine 2013 created a screenplay that not only defies the normal typecasts that most actors have but also adds depth to the main character of Freddy Helfin. If it weren't for any of the background given to Stallone's character the audience would have no idea about Heflin's past and why he acts the way he is in the movie. When it is revealed though it's a heartfelt story that contains a lot of emotion. Even more interesting is how little Stallone uses a gun. Not only is Stallone overweight but he barely even raises his voice  which is rare. The character of Heflin is very self contained and covers it up well.Also playing a role that is out his usual casting role is Ray Liotta. For anyone who's not familiar Liotta frequently plays scumbags and creeps. A good example of this is from Unlawful Entry 1992 and a bad example is from Turbulence 1997. But what wasn't seen coming was Liotta playing not only a supporting character but also a tactical one. There is one scene where he explains to Stallone's character how he should take on convicted felons and the advice he gives is extremely noteworthy. Liotta you should be doing this more often my friend. Along with him are Harvey Keitel Robert De Niro future director Peter Berg Robert Patrick Noah Emmerich from The Truman Show 1998 how coincidental! and just for laughs Mr. RoboCop 3 1993 himself Robert John Burke. All the actors even the ones not mentioned do a fine job.What also makes this movie a fish out of water role for Sylvester Stallone is how human the story makes him look. This isn't a movie where Stallone mows down villains with a rapidfire gun without taking any hits. Stallone's character is flawed and limited humanizing him for the entire running time. That's something serious. Adding to the realism of the story is the cinematography where most scenes take place in the suburbs or along the shore outside the city. Finally what helps complete this feeling is Howard Shore's score to the film. It isn't the strongest of film music but it does contain some very simple themes that help bring out the emotion of various scenes. Overall a very strong drama  thriller.It's not your regular Stallone shoot 'em up and that's fine. The entire cast in the movie performs great. The music isn't complex but is well supported by a strong cast and character driven story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cop Land is a tense story about corrupt cops coverups and a small town sheriff who goes through a remarkable transition. With its allstar cast some great performances and an intriguing plot this movie's engaging right from the start but then becomes even more gripping as its characters are gradually introduced and begin to interact with each other.The small town of Garrison New Jersey which is located just across the river from New York City is popularly referred to Cop Land because it's populated mainly by NYPD officers who find its suburban tranquillity provides a pleasant contrast to the areas in which they work during the day. Garrison however is soon revealed to be more than just an idyllic retreat as it's actually populated by corrupt cops who are routinely paid to operate in accordance with the requirements of important crime bosses who have also rewarded them by putting up the money for their houses.Lieutenant Ray Donlan Harvey Keitel is the leader of Garrison's rogue cops and effectively runs the town. His nephew Murray Superboy Babitch Michael Rapaport is a young cop who gets involved in an incident which ends with him shooting and killing two black teenagers. When it becomes clear that the young men were unarmed and Murray starts panicking about what the repercussions might be Ray assists by faking his nephew's suicide and this seems to defuse the situation.A short time later NYPD Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Moe Tilden Robert De Niro arrives in Garrison and tries to persuade local Sheriff Freddy Heflin Sylvester Stallone to help him by providing information about Ray's shady activities but Freddy declines out of loyalty to Ray and his associates. This effectively ends Tilden's investigation as Garrison is technically outside of his jurisdiction and also he's been pressured by some of Ray's connections in high places to drop his investigation unless he can provide some hard evidence to support his suspicions.Garrison's Sheriff admires the cops who live in his town and regularly turns a blind eye to their wrongdoings. He's aware of Murray Babitch's presence in the town and remains unconcerned until it becomes evident that Ray's decided to have Murray killed. Ray considers this to be necessary because until his nephew's body is found the police investigations are likely to continue and they in turn could jeopardise his whole business.Freddy Heflin is a well meaning character who avoids conflict and is virtually powerless as he's controlled by Ray. He's rather timid extremely overweight and given little respect by the men that he admires so much. He's also experienced many disappointments in the past. He's in love with Liz Randone Annabella Sciorra a woman who he saved from drowning some years ago. It was during this act of courage that he suffered an injury which left him deaf in one ear and this disability prevented him from achieving his ambition to become a cop in the big city.Freddy goes to Tilden to tell him what he wanted to know about Ray and his sidekicks but Tilden is no longer interested. As he's leaving the building Freddy sees some discarded documents relating to Tilden's investigation and soon learns more about Ray's involvement in a wide range of criminal activities. This motivates Freddy to take on Ray and his gang in what turns out to be an exciting shootout.Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Freddy is incredibly sensitive as he conveys so strongly the despair and sadness of a good natured man whose been left emotionally devastated by his past experiences. The transformation he goes through when he decides to take on Ray and his gang is terrific and made convincing by the sheer quality of Stallone's acting. The cast in this movie deliver top class performances all round but Stallone Harvey Keitel and Ray Liotta's contributions really stand out as being exceptionally powerful.".

Stallone plays a Sheriff of a small New Jersey town where most of the NYPD lives. The cops are crooked and a set up goes bad very bad.  I dont want to give away too much of the movie because i saw it knowing nothing and absolutley loved it. The best thing about it to me was Stallones performance.  He was just great. I think he really deserved an oscar for it.

	onyx:emotionText "Sylvester Stallone Ray Liotta Robert DeNiro and Harvey Kietel star in this amazing movie which deals with the story of crooked cops.  Stallone plays a Sheriff of a small New Jersey town where most of the NYPD lives. The cops are crooked and a set up goes bad very bad.  I dont want to give away too much of the movie because i saw it knowing nothing and absolutley loved it. The best thing about it to me was Stallones performance.  He was just great. I think he really deserved an oscar for it.  Everyone comes down on stallone for being just an action star saying his only good acting performance comes from Rocky and Rambo..well if you all believe that just check this movie out Stallone will really impress you. 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "Copland was a treat of a film.  The cast was the best we had seen in any Hollywood film in years and there was no reason that this film could go wrong and even though it was a brilliant film I somehow felt quite disappointed when the film credits started to roll.I was looking forward to finally seeing Stallone show off his acting abilities as he has been very miss treated by the critics but looking at films like this and Rocky will just tell you that he can act.  Then you got Harvey Keitel Ray Liotta and Robert De Niro thrown into the mix where can you go wrong I would say James Mangold.   His job wasn't that bad but I think the film should been handed to a more experienced director.  Scorsese or Michael Mann would have been the best choice to make this film as they both know how to get the emotions going and the characters flowing but like I said this movie still impressed me in many many ways one is Sylvester Stallone.   No one could have been Sheriff Freddy Heflin except for Sly.  He brought so much to the character and never gived it up.   Some say it was his comeback film I would say it was the film where he had to prove a point about his acting and he sure did it with elegance and grace and I don't think I have ever come across somebody has never been moved or amazed by his performance. Freddy is the local sheriff who abides by the law but his dream is to be apart of the boys in blue but because of a disability where he is deaf in one ear he sadly cannot be a cop only a local town sheriff but it's not his town.   Ray played by Keitel and his merry men run the town of Jersey. As they are all police officers no one questions there lives and motives towards their jobs till Freddy starts to smell something fishy and entails the help of De Niro who plays a detective wanting to bring Ray down.  The story unfolds and there are many things to look out for but the pace of the movie seems quite confused towards the end as it doesn't seem to have much special to add.   The beginning and middle are excellent and let the movie go along fantastically but you just see the end coming really and it was like the script writer ran out of ideas which seems to be the case in many films we see nowadays and this sadly was one of them.  Still Ray Liotta adds the spice to the movie and makes it extra special and doesn't make the movie a complete downfall.  I am yet to see the new directors cut but from what I heard there isn't much to notice as far as new scenes go but I will try and get my hands on it to see whether the movie has been improved but till then I will say that Copland has top notch flawless acting by everyone all round especially Liotta and Stallone and has a great story that could have gone much further but it didn't so I will leave it there.Very good".

	schema:reviewBody "First off hats off to James Mangold for assembling what had to be one of the finest casts of the 1990's. Second another hat off to him for making the best Martin Scorsese film Scorsese never directed. Third thanks for reuniting DeNiro and Keitel. They need to work more together that is.But the real treasure of this film is Sylvester Stallone turning in the finest performance of his career arguably and the finest since the original Rocky indisputable. If you have only seen Stallone in his pumpedup muscle fests of the 80's and early 90's then you haven't seen the real Stallone. Copland allows Stallone to inhabit a character that completely unlike any other we have seen him do.Freddie Heflin is the sheriff of a small town on the Jersey side of the Hudson River. He desperately wants to be NYPD but can't because he is deaf in one ear. The good news is the entire town is populated with NYPD cops so the town has the lowest crime rate in the state. The bad news is someone got all those cops lowinterest home loans through the mob in exchange for some favors. Freddie was given the position of sheriff because the locals think he's slow stupid and will tow the line to keep his job. They are about to find out that they are wrong.Stallone gained a lot of weight to become Freddie. He plays the role totally introverted only speaking out toward the end when he is finally pushed in a corner. His clothes don't fit him. He walks awkwardly. He nods and smiles a lot. In short Stallone melts into the character leaving behind all the ego he has been accused of bringing to his parts. It's truly a revelation...and should have relaunched Stallone as a dramatic actor possibly even a miniDeNiro.I'm not going to give away the whole story but one of the best elements I have to mention here. The way Freddie lost is hearing is a tragic story. At the age of 18 he witnesses a car go off a bridge. He dives into the water to save the driver a teenage girl. He rescues the girl but loses his hearing in the process. The girl whom he falls in love with rejects him and marries another man an NYPD cop. To this day Freddie watches her from afar always keeping an eye on her and hoping one day she'll come around to feel the same way for him as he does for her. It's a touching extra to a story of hard boiled men locked in a hardcore power struggle.Lastly I know a lot of people love Ray Liotta. At the time this came out I was not a fan. This in my opinion is Liotta's finest work. He utters one of the best quotes in cop movie history Being right isn't a bullet proof vest Freddie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a solid cop thriller that's suspenseful and extremely well acted. It's a powerful film at timeswith a pretty suspenseful finale plus it has a good mystery to it as well. i really liked all the characters and it has one of the best casts i have ever seen. I admit i was expecting this to be a bit better however i still enjoyed it very much and it also helps that the story is engrossing for the most part. although i would have liked to see more of Robert Deniro he still shined in his scenes and all the rest of the cast is awesome especially Stallone and Liotta. The Direction is very good. James Mangold does a very good job here creating some cool atmosphere and some cool camera tricks here and there nothing fancy but he did his job very well. There is a bit of blood. We get quite a few extremely bloody gunshot wounds in the finale but that's it. The Acting is AWESOME!. Sylvester Stallone is AMAZING as always and gives one of the best performances in his career and he proves that he is a fantastic actorin this he is always amazing but this is one of his best as he is required to play a very gritty and different role here and he was up to the challenge! Stallone Rules!. Ray Liotta is Awesome here he is a fantastic actor and i just loved every minute he was on screen! he's crazy Liotta Rules!. Harvey Keitel is also one of my favorites and he is great as usual when on screen. Robert De Niro is AMAZING as always and was great here i just wish he had more screen time!Deniro Rules!. Peter Berg is fine with what he has to do. Janeane Garofalo is okay but didn't have much to do. Robert Patrick is great here and adds his usual intensity. Michael Rapaport does what he has to do well as the rookie cop. Annabella Sciorra is easy on the eyes but her part is very thin. Cathy Moriarty adds class when she's on screen. Overall this is a solid thriller that i expected a bit more of but still highly recommend! 12 out of 5".

Hitler sure thought so.  He had his favorite general poisoned about that there is no question.Did Rommel know Hitler before the war?  Not sure when they became acquainted but Rommel ran AH's bodyguard unit for a while then became one of Hitler's favorite generals when he helped sweep the British to Dunkirk in 1940.Was Rommel aware of and morally responsible for the Holocaust?  A recent award winning Rommel biography cites one scene I wish they could have included in this film  Rommel around 1941 advised Hitler that he was concerned by Allied carping on German antisemitism.  Why don't we put some Jews into prominent leadership positions and shut them up? Rommel suggested.  Hitler told Rommel to stick to military matters and after the general exited the room told associates  That fellow has absolutely no understanding of what we are trying to accomplish.The movie does generally succeed in portraying the theme of a soldier so singlemindedly focused on the professional technique of his job that he only slowly awakens to the moral horror and selfdestructiveness of the leader he serves.The Churchill quote used at the film's ending is meant to address and answer the questions about whether it is morally proper to make a film that glorifies a Nazi general.  If Churchill could say such magnanimous things about him...and it's an accurate quote...then so could Hollywood.Interesting historical note  British film audiences in the early 1950s were not in such a generous mood.  The studio quickly churned out the muchinferior Desert Rats film featuring Mason as a morevillainous Rommel to mollify outraged critics.Where did the quote come from that is spoken in this film by von Reunstadt Victory has a thousand fathers but defeat is an orphan?  Yes JFK used it famously after the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  Many newsmen of the time mistakenly credited the president with originating it but JFK didn't claim credit for it.  The line has since been traced back to some Italian count in the 1500s.  His name was Ciano or something like that.  But JFK was a big movie fan and my guess is probably learned  this aphorism from The Desert Fox a decade before using it in his famous postBay of Pigs press conference!".

Not sure when they became acquainted but Rommel ran AH's bodyguard unit for a while then became one of Hitler's favorite generals when he helped sweep the British to Dunkirk in 1940.Was Rommel aware of and morally responsible for the Holocaust?  A recent award winning Rommel biography cites one scene I wish they could have included in this film  Rommel around 1941 advised Hitler that he was concerned by Allied carping on German antisemitism.  Why don't we put some Jews into prominent leadership positions and shut them up? Rommel suggested.  Hitler told Rommel to stick to military matters and after the general exited the room told associates  That fellow has absolutely no understanding of what we are trying to accomplish.The movie does generally succeed in portraying the theme of a soldier so singlemindedly focused on the professional technique of his job that he only slowly awakens to the moral horror and selfdestructiveness of the leader he serves.The Churchill quote used at the film's ending is meant to address and answer the questions about whether it is morally proper to make a film that glorifies a Nazi general.  If Churchill could say such magnanimous things about him...and it's an accurate quote...then so could Hollywood.Interesting historical note  British film audiences in the early 1950s were not in such a generous mood.  The studio quickly churned out the muchinferior Desert Rats film featuring Mason as a morevillainous Rommel to mollify outraged critics.Where did the quote come from that is spoken in this film by von Reunstadt Victory has a thousand fathers but defeat is an orphan?  Yes JFK used it famously after the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  Many newsmen of the time mistakenly credited the president with originating it but JFK didn't claim credit for it.  The line has since been traced back to some Italian count in the 1500s.  His name was Ciano or something like that.  But JFK was a big movie fan and my guess is probably learned  this aphorism from The Desert Fox a decade before using it in his famous postBay of Pigs press conference!";

It would be interesting as one reviewer wrote to see a German filmmaker's take on Rommel's life.The script is tight giving the cast excellent opportunities to create intelligent and believable characters. To the film's credit the historical events are generqally presented with fairly good accuracy. As a side note the voice of British General Desmond Morris upon whose biography the film is based and who gives a running narration throughout was dubbed by actor Michael Rennie THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL but who is not credited.Despite flaws that mark all historical movies of any age but especially biographies I highly recommend THE DESERT FOX especially for it's acting.".

	schema:headline " Not A Fully Reliable Portrayal";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a pretty solid attempt to portray a soldier's great dilemma  balancing loyalty to the state and obedience to orders with the higher calling of loyalty to what's right and just. Erwin Rommel was one of the great German generals of World War II a hero in Germany and respected by the Allies. In the end he also became involved with the conspiracy against Hitler. The movie shows us some of that development beginning with his incredulousness at Hitler's orders that the Afrika Korps stand and fight to the last man in Africa rather than withdrawing to fight another day. According to the movie it was this stand and fight to the last man attitude of Der Fuhrer that finally pushed Rommel over the edge. That makes Rommel consistent with what I know of most of the leaders of the resistance such as it was to Hitler. The opposition wasn't political it wasn't based on a rejection of Nazi ideology or distaste for Hitler's racial policies  it tended to be based simply on the belief that Hitler was leading Germany to defeat in the war. That's the overarching sentiment portrayed here. That being the case Rommel may not have been the sympathetic character this movie makes him out to be  maybe he just had the smarts to realize that Germany was fighting a losing war. There's also no mention of his performance during the German invasion of France in 1940 in which Rommel  as a panzer commander  received some German criticism for both his tactics and his tendency to exaggerate his achievements.James Mason was very good as Rommel. His portrayal was believable although I wish there had been more exploration in the story of where Rommel came from rather than simply starting us abruptly in Africa. Made only 6 years after the end of the war the movie is also somewhat courageous in presenting a German general even one who was unsympathetic to Hitler in such a sympathetic light. I didn't find this to be structured particularly well. There was too much narration involved which seemed put an end to any flow the movie might have been trying to develop. Some scenes particularly of the Allied landings on DDay featured a little too much patriotic American and British and French music as the troops went ashore frankly listening to the Marine Fight Song or The Marseillaise in a movie about Rommel seemed a bit silly.It's an interesting movie but doesn't seem to completely capture the man it portrays.".

It stars James Mason as Rommel who in turn is supported by Cedric Hardwicke Jessica Tandy Luther Adler Everett Sloane Leo Carroll George Macready  Richard Boone.Possibly the first mainstream film to boldly humanise a German military leader The Desert Fox is propelled by a mesmerising performance by Mason and backed up by Johnson's literate script. It condenses Young's biography into just an hour and half of film but in that relatively short running time the makers have done enough to give decent insight into a man who the opposition had much respect for. The plot basically takes us on Rommel's journey from victories in North Africa where he is loyally followed by the Afrika Korps to his defeat at El Alamein infuriating Hitler by disregarding orders to French coastal defences his role in the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler and his subsequent death by military command. Shot in a sort of semidocumentary style by Hathaway with stock war footage flitting in and out of the film it's credit to Hathaway that the direction is pacey and doesn't get bogged down by the necessary long passages of dialogue exchanges. The support cast all do fine work with Adler's cameo as the Fuhrer particularly memorable while the overriding satisfaction comes from finally seeing a Hollywood production capable of an even handed and sympathetic portrait of a opposition leader.Good adult cinema. 710".

Curiously James Mason once mentioned how he was up for the part of Rommel and was competing with another Fox contractplayer Gary Merrill best known as Bette Davis's love interest in ALL ABOUT EVE.  Mason was impressed by how well Merrill marched and strutted doing bits of militarylike physical action that didn't come easily to the urbane Mason.  Even though Mason ultimately won the part over Merrill he selfcritically felt he didn't fully do the role justice though many including myself wouldn't agree with him.  Perhaps the studio opted for Mason to bring out a sympathetic quality because viewers do tend to forget the numbers of Allies who died directly because of the main character!

	schema:reviewBody "Though The Desert Fox is good as far as it goes and James Mason is perfectly cast as Erwin Rommel one would hope that a fuller biographical study might be done on the screen.Erwin Rommel was one of a group of like minded military leaders in various countries who after World War I rose to the top of their country's military establishment because they saw the value of the tank in any future war. Some of those people would be Charles DeGaulle in France Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton in America Marshal Tukachevksy in the Soviet Union and Rommel in Germany.In 1942 Hitler as he was constantly doing sent Rommel in to bail out the Italians who up to that point had been running the desert campaign in North Africa. With less men and supplies his tactical ability bedeviled the Allied command until The Second Battle of El Alamein.The film starts with Rommel as desert warfare genius and then when he does become ill and is invalided out of North Africa the Allies regain the initiative and beat his famed Afrika Korps. Rommel is then sent to Western Europe to supervise the defenses on the Atlantic.There comes a point when Rommel does realize that his Fuehrer is destroying his country and becomes involved in the plot to kill him and overthrow the government. That is what most of the film deals with.James Mason is a stalwart Rommel a perfect conception of the man they called The Desert Fox. In this mostly male film Jessica Tandy has little to do but be loyal and supportive as Frau Rommel.Luther Adler who among other parts he played in his long distinguished career was David BenGurion. He goes the whole opposite way in his portrayal of a ranting and malevolent Adolph Hitler. How a man who took his Jewish heritage as seriously as Luther Adler did prepare for the role of Hitler is beyond my scope. But then again there were few actors as good as he.Though Mason does a fine job given what limited material he had to work from archives have been opened and we know a whole lot more about Erwin Rommel. Time for another biographical study.".

He goes the whole opposite way in his portrayal of a ranting and malevolent Adolph Hitler. How a man who took his Jewish heritage as seriously as Luther Adler did prepare for the role of Hitler is beyond my scope. But then again there were few actors as good as he.Though Mason does a fine job given what limited material he had to work from archives have been opened and we know a whole lot more about Erwin Rommel. Time for another biographical study.";

When I first saw it in the theater it did whet my appetite to learn more about this horrendous and costly war. I have been interested in it since. The acting is firstrate and unlike Enemy at the Gate the British and American accents don't detract from the film the British accents at any rate. As others have noted in their reviews of this film Rommel probably wasn't antisemitic. He deliberately ignored Hitler's orders to round up Jews during the invasion of France. He also never forgave Hitler for abandoning the Afrika Korps to their fate in 1942 not to Hitler's less than energetic attempts to keep the DAK supplied.".

This seemed to be one of the better docudramas a type with a notveryillustrious tradition.  What I found particularly interesting was how a movie made 50 years ago could reflect what are considered to be new views today.  I'm referring particularly to the statement that Hitler was seeking his own destruction presented as new in the recent Ian Kearshaw biography Nemesis and the lack of total control by the Nazis over what Germans thought said and where they went also presented as a new view.

	schema:reviewBody "Even today the name Erwin Rommel conjures up visions of a superlative soldier and a complex man . In short Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was an enigma  a member of the Nazi party and an admirer of Hitler but who fought the cleanest campaign of the war in North Africa . Compare the conduct of both sides in that particular conflict then compare it to say the Eastern front or the Pacific campaign . As BAND OF BROTHERS shows it wasn't uncommon for either side to execute prisoners even if practical necessity wasn't involved So Rommel was respected as both a soldier and a human being but THE DESERT FOX is a disappointment . It's a Hollywood movie that was made just six years after the end of the war so in some places the producers don't want to praise the subject matter too much which is understandable because an American audience wouldn't like a movie where the lead character has contemptible views of American servicemen after soundly beating them at The Kasserine Pass . But at other points in the movie Rommel is seen praising Hitler while describing other senior party members as  Murderers  ! There thankfully seems to be historical context to all this . Yes Erwin Rommel was an admirer of Hitler because Hitler solved many economic problems like hyper inflation and massive unemployment when he came to power in 1933 so for a German to admire Hitler in those days was the norm however objectionable this may seem with hindsight . Unfortunately once the war ended instantly revisionist opinions amongst the surviving Germans came to the fore where they bleated that they despised Hitler and the Nazis and their genocidal policies and we see this in umpteen movies like DAS BOOT  CROSS OF IRON and THE EAGLE HAS LANDED  so much so that you'd think that there was only a handful of Nazis in Germany from 193345  so at least this movie deserves some credit for putting things into perspective However once again bad history and factual errors creep in as Rommel is recruited into the plot to assassinate Hitler . Rommel may have been asked to take part in the plot to overthrow Hitler but this movie over states the case . Worse it also paints Gerd Von Rundstedt  Possibly the Wehrmacht's greatest leader  as knowing about the assassination plot against Hitler but casually refusing to take part . Despite being no fan of Hitler or his murderous stooges Von Rundstedt was as shocked and as disgusted as the most loyal party member upon hearing of the bombing of Hitler's headquarters so it's highly unlikely he'd have had prior knowledge of the assassination plot . The ending is somewhat moving as Rommel is arrested and led away on charges of treason but perhaps the most poignant thing is that in real life Rommel was as innocent as nearly every other person murdered by the Nazis since he took no part in the plot . The story goes that immediately after the plot Rommel's staff started criticising the fact that it would have been better if the plot had suceeded hence Rommel was falsely suspected being one of the ringleaders which sealed his fate THE DESERT FOX THE STORY OF ROMMEL is a very disappointing movie on one of the 20th Centuries most respected military leaders . It fails to show his life prior to 1941 when he ironically fought against the Italians in the first world war  of how he made his reputation as a military commander against the French in 1940 and how during the Normandy landings he and Von Rundstedt argued as to how best to use the panzer defences  As Anzio showed naval firepower would wreak havoc on units close to the shoreline so Von Rundstedt was probably right  but the movie shoots itself in the foot even more by including stuff that isn't correct and a film that I once enjoyed seeing as a child is now spoiled for me".

I can't fault the acting as the cast were all good.Two main points doubtlessly raised by other commentators.aThe portrayal of Rommel as a good guy went a bit too far. True he became anti HitlerNazi in the end but this seems to have been primarily due to having been abandoned in Africa and having his requests in Normandy turned down by Hitler not due to any squeamishness about the Nazi state who's brutality must have been self evident to him for many years or of Nazi aggression who he was all too willing to promote. Don't forget he was the mastermind Behind the Blitzkrieg in Holland France and Belgium in 1940 and saw no wrong in that campaign.b The use of incorrect stock footage Such as a view of the Maginot line fortification to demonstrate the Normandy beaches. In the strafing attack we see a TMB Avenger transmute into 3 Spitfires who had gun flashes superimposed onto the incorrect section of their wings and also having the sound of whiny prewar US fixed pitch radial engined planes dubbed over them as did the footage of the Beaufighter strafing. something that still happens in films today  give em what they expect not what is real and the tacky patriotic music. Probably taken from the first shelf in the effects room and couldn't be bothered to look any further. I'm sure military vehicleweaponry aficionados will have spotted some similar points about the MTguns portrayed.The scenes in the train and Rommel's house were authentic enough and seemed to have been filmed on location so its a shame they skimped on these other details.One scene that did amuse me was when the Gestapo man followed the doctor out of the hospital and never shut the door properly behind him. Now this would have doubtless been re shot in here the guard merely leaned over and pulled it shut.Still a masterpiece of history when compared to 'Battle of the Bulge'".

	schema:headline " A Soldier Not a Politician.";
	schema:reviewBody "Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was a complicated man both more and less than the romanticized figure that Desmond Young's biography and the movie based on it present us with. Like Oliver Cromwell he should really be seen as he was warts and all.Rommel James Mason was vain for one thing. He'd won the Pour le Merit in World War I and made sure he wore it. He was sensitive. His letters to his wife Lucie Jessica Tandy are filled with admiration for the flowers that abounded in Libya during the Spring. He had a slight but distinct sense of humor. The Italian General Ettore Bastico became Bombastico in Rommel's lexicon. And a more thorough investigation of the man suggests he wasn't very political after all. He may not have even had a clear idea of the plot.But the war in Northern Africa was a peculiar war from beginning to end. The chivalry shown by Rommel and Desmond Young at the beginning is thoroughly believable. The British managed at one point in the seesaw battle to capture an Italian aristocrat. When the Italian government offered money for the man's return the offended POW refused to be released claiming the offer wasn't high enough. I know. That has nothing to do with the movie but I thought it was pretty funny.The story itself at least as rendered here is probably familiar to those with any degree of historical maturity. Rommel is the desert fox constantly outwitting the Allies in North Africa until the Afrika Korps is bled white by lack of supplies. Back in Germany Rommel is contacted by conspirators in the plot against Hitler the July plot including an old friend played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke he of the magnificent voice. Rommel reluctantly joins the plot although exactly what his role was is never made clear. There is a reference to his leadership but apparently all he wanted to do was make peace with the British French and Americans in order to fight the Russians more efficiently. In any case his involvement is discovered.

	onyx:emotionText "Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was a complicated man both more and less than the romanticized figure that Desmond Young's biography and the movie based on it present us with. Like Oliver Cromwell he should really be seen as he was warts and all.Rommel James Mason was vain for one thing. He'd won the Pour le Merit in World War I and made sure he wore it. He was sensitive. His letters to his wife Lucie Jessica Tandy are filled with admiration for the flowers that abounded in Libya during the Spring. He had a slight but distinct sense of humor. The Italian General Ettore Bastico became Bombastico in Rommel's lexicon. And a more thorough investigation of the man suggests he wasn't very political after all. He may not have even had a clear idea of the plot.But the war in Northern Africa was a peculiar war from beginning to end. The chivalry shown by Rommel and Desmond Young at the beginning is thoroughly believable. The British managed at one point in the seesaw battle to capture an Italian aristocrat. When the Italian government offered money for the man's return the offended POW refused to be released claiming the offer wasn't high enough. I know. That has nothing to do with the movie but I thought it was pretty funny.The story itself at least as rendered here is probably familiar to those with any degree of historical maturity. Rommel is the desert fox constantly outwitting the Allies in North Africa until the Afrika Korps is bled white by lack of supplies. Back in Germany Rommel is contacted by conspirators in the plot against Hitler the July plot including an old friend played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke he of the magnificent voice. Rommel reluctantly joins the plot although exactly what his role was is never made clear. There is a reference to his leadership but apparently all he wanted to do was make peace with the British French and Americans in order to fight the Russians more efficiently. In any case his involvement is discovered. After the attempt on his life Hitler had 5000 people executed some by hanging them from meat hooks and filming them while they strangled to death in nooses made of piano wire. Rommel is permitted to take poison in order to preserve his reputation and insure the safety of his family.James Mason does pretty well by the role. Too well.

	schema:reviewBody "True Grit director Henry Hathaway tackled a controversial subject with his 1951 World War II biography epic The Desert Fox with British actor James Mason impersonating this highly regarded Teutonic tank warrior. When Twentieth Century Fox released this movie many critics and moviegoers thought that what Hathaway and scenarist Nunnally Johnson had produced was nothing short of hero worship for one of Hitler's henchmen. Based on the biography by British officer Desmond Young The Desert Fox devotes most of its concise 88minutes looks to the last days of Rommel after a preliminary glance at his career with the Afrika Korps. Generally the focus of this movie is the part that Rommel played in the 20th July Hitler bomb plot. Rommel is a soldier first but second he believes that Hitler has gone mad principally because he demands life or death service to the Third Reich. Rommel refuses to waste the lives of his valiant men.History reveals that Rommel played no part in the bomb plot. Here Rommel does not play a major role but he supports the idea. Nevertheless he tries to change the mind of Adolf Hitler and reasons with him in one scene. Luther Adler portrays Hitler as an infantile leader prone to temper tantrums of rage. Several other historic highranking German leaders appear in The Desert Fox. Eventually Rommel must commit suicide because he has been implicated in the bomb plot and wants to secure the safety of his wife and son. James Mason is of course outstanding and makes Rommel look like a kindly sympathetic man with a high sense of morality.No The Desert Fox is not a battleoriented movie with combat. Hathaway drew virtually all the battle footage from archival sources with a glimpse of U.S. General George Patton in one scene. In other scenes he relies on pretty obvious back projection techniques. In other words most of The Desert Fox is about soldiers discussing orders situations and predicaments. Richard Boone later of Have Gun Will Travel plays an aide to Rommel. Apparently the filmmakers felt that they could whitewash Rommel by his stand against Hitler. Hathaway spends at least five minutes on the details of the bomb plot and Hitler's survival. Rommel appears to have been a model husband and he never loses his temper even when he disapproves of the subject of conversation.The opening precredit sequence where British commandos attack headquarters hoping to kill Rommel is the best action scene in the film. Such was the uproar that The Desert Fox spawned that Twentieth Century Fox produced a sequel The Desert Rats starring Richard Burton wherein Rommel did not receive a sympathetic portrayal. Twenty years later when director Henry Hathaway made Raid on Rommel he included a scene with the famous Field Marshall arguing with a British doctor about stamps. Hathaway did not direct The Desert Rats. Instead Robert Wise helmed that war adventure.Indeed there are many inaccuracies in The Desert Fox. The planes that strafe Rommel's command car change between the first time that we see them and when they actually riddle his command car.".

It stands in sharp contrast to the girliemen linguinespine cowards in Hollywood today. Now we have PEARL HARBOR  which justified the Japanese attack  and Steven Spielberg's godawful SAVING PRIVATE RYAN  which took the heroic true story of the Sullivan Brothers and turned their great deeds into spineless liberal mush. Similarly the SILVER which declined to show an alleged antiAmerican film in 1951 is now under American Film Institute ownership and can be relied on to play every antiAmerican movie that comes on the market while regularly downplaying or ignoring proAmerican classics.Both DESERT FOX and DESERT RATS are recent DVD releases.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the book by General Morris this film looks back at the career of Rommel  better known as the Desert Fox for his sterling military manoeuvres in North Africa. We join his story after his many victories against the Allied Forces at a time when the war has started to turn in the latter's favour and Hitler refuses to acknowledge this in his orders. Rommel tries to do his duty in the face of what he considers madness but soon his frustrations begin to take him in a different direction.It is unlikely that if Rommel had not turned against Hitler towards the latter stages of the war we would have seen a film praising his ability as a commander made less than a decade later or at all in fact. With this in mind I watched this film with a big pinch of salt and certainly not as a historical piece of cinema mainly because he is presented in such a glowing light. Aside from this the film is still an interesting introduction to the man but no more than that because although we are told about his prowess we are never allowed to see it. I was interested in the end of his career and life but I would have liked a bit more detail on the battles and skirmishes that he was famous for  not necessarily reenactments but some way of showing his intelligence other than pointing at a few maps or having other officers comment on how great he was. However the film is still engaging and makes for an interesting watch unless you actually know something about Rommel in which case it will be frightfully basic mainly thanks to one main factor.In the title role Mason is great. I'm not sure about accuracy but he does a good job at producing a character that is intelligent courageous loyal but not blindly so. It may have been a bit glowing and brushed over the fact that he did actually fight for Nazi Germany at a very high level but his performance suited the film. Support is roundly good from people like Tandy Carroll and a nice ironic Hitler from Adler however the film is very much Mason's and he takes it and dominates it by the power of his performance.Overall this is no more than a starting point at understanding why Rommel was so highly considered during the war and saluted by Churchill himself in the House of Commons. Without any military detail the film focuses on the fact that he came to hate Hitler and he is presented as loyal brave but thoughtful as a result. Perhaps not accurate but certainly an interesting watch thanks to the commanding sorry lead from Mason.".

Completely passing over General Rommels achievements in France and North Africa we first get to see Field Marshal Rommel during the battle of El Alamein in October 1942. Where the British launched their great offensive against the GermanItalian troop that within seven months in May 1943 cleared the continent of Africa of a Nazi military presence with the surrender of some 300000 axis soldiers. We never get to see in The Desert Fox Rommels brilliant victories in the battle of France in the spring of 1940 and his successful hit and run attacks on the much larger British Army as well as his breakthrough in the late spring of 1942 of the British lines Rommels brilliant encirclement and capture of Tobruk a town that held out for 242 days against the Afrika Corps the year before taking 35000 British troops captive at the cost of under 500 German and Italian casualties. The movie instead concentrates on Rommels involvement or noninvolvementin the plot to kill the German Fhurer Adolf Hitler Luther Adler. Recovering from wounds that he suffered when his command car was strafed by the RAF Rommel is later contacted at his home by German generals Burgorf  MaiselEverett Sloane  Do Dee Leoand given an ultimatum to either commit suicide and die a hero or stand trial for treason. Even though the movie tries very hard to paint Rommel as a reluctant but major player in the Generals plot to assassinate Hitler history proves otherwise showing Field Marshall Rommel as a loyal German soldier who followed the orders from his Fhurer almost without question. Rommel did have doubts about Hitler's military strategy but he let him know about it to Hitler's great displeasure. Rommells' low opinion of Hitler's ability to wage war was in no way comparable to actively trying to have him killed like what happened on July 20 1944 in Hitler's military bunker the Wolf's liar in the East Prussian woods. Very effective portrayal by James Mason as Field Marshall Erwin Rommel who was as chivalrous to his enemies in defeat as he was courageous against them in battle which may be why the film makers tried to make him out as one of the major conspirators against Hitler's leadership to the point of having him killed. The true facts about Field Marshal Erwin Rommel that's come out and surfaced since the end of WWII doesn't back up their conclusions at all in fact Rommel considered the killing of the German leader an act of high treason. The main reason for Rommel's death by his own handhad to do more with him not reporting those who wanted to recruit him into the plot to kill Hitler which it seemed that he quite didn't fully grasp then anything else. The fact that he didn't want to turn them over those who approached him with the assassination plot to the Nazi authorities and thus the dreaded Gestapo was his knowing that it would mean instant death for them and he wouldn't be able to live with himself if he did.".

It is all about Rommel and lauds him as a great general but at no time in this entire movie did we ever get an idea of why he was great. What made him so successful? Was it his drive his unwillingness to accept defeat his discipline with his men? I was looking for a Pattonlike rendition that really gets into the character but this fell way flat. Most of the dialog is contrived and sensationalized and feels stale and artificial. There is some good action here and there but not much. The tail end of the story which discusses his involvement in the plot to assassinate Hitler was the most informative part and probably the most interesting. But as a history lesson on Germany's greatest general this was a failure.".

But there is none of that it deals with the last year or two of his life and tries in a way to whitewash him. So I just have to suppose that Rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the conquering and killing business without any particular charm or notoriety in behaviour. Such real life people just do not make good movie material. I almost feel sorry for James Mason really one of my favorite actors who had to impersonate a pretty wooden character. Actually a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted on this movie  with the exception of Luther Adler who gives a really memorable and weirdly naturalistic portrayal of Adolf Hitler.There might also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the German speaking world. Famous British actors impersonating Germans are just not credible. Rommel for example is perceived here not just as a German but as a typical Southerner from BadenWrttemberg. You immediately think of a certain dialect a certain kind of wit a certain way of seeing the world the total opposite of eg a Prussian junker. I also think that there are now mixed feelings about the assassination attempt of July 20th many of those who were in on the conspiracy were not democrats and just wanted the German troops to join the Western Allies against the advancing Bolsheviks thus prolonging the war forever.The best movie portrayal of an intellectual intelligent military mind is in my opinion still Patton 1970. Incidentally General Patton can be glimpsed for a short moment in the ample documentary footing used for this movie a low angle shot while he is inspecting passing vehicles. The open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible!".

It's story is relatively simple  a group of rather middleclass young radicals set off bombs hold up banks and kidnap an industrialist whilst a police net closes in around them. There is a traitor in their midst and little do these bumbling terrorists know that the person holding the purse strings for their organisation is the rich industrialist himself who has begun the film by pontificating how the lack of terrorist activities in Germany makes it difficult for he and his political friends to move Authoritarian measures into place. A topical film then. What is striking about it is Fassbinder's extraordinary approach to both narrative  made up of stark elliptical scenes veering between polemic realism and surrealism  and misenscene. Most of the sets are domestic interiors and these are filmed from such odd angles and lit with a strange plasticity so that the environments become as much characters in the film as the human figures. One scene a long and fairly talky piece in which the cell go over their plans and review their situation is filmed with such choreographic virtuosity that it takes the breath away  a single long pan around the room catches snatches of dialogue and interaction as the characters themselves crisscross the screen rising or sitting as the camera moves onto them each piece of the conversation picking up as its speakers encounter the screen. It must have taken a great deal of minute rehearsal and a perfectly mathematical mind to carry off this exceptional sequence which is truly bravura.The film looks and sounds like no other. Besides the weird visual quality of the interiors the soundtrack has a constant backing of TV speak mood music a strange din which is always competing for the viewer's attention against what is being said by the characters on the screen. This has a twofold purpose it both emphasises the way in which these people encounter a world mediated by broadcasters and also does the Brechtian trick of emphasising the phoniness of the cloakanddagger noirspy thriller situations the film places its characters in. These are emphatically people caught in someone else's plot or in their own it's hard to tell.The Third Generation is scabrous about the bourgeois values of the industrialist and his associates these values are condemned as the same values the Nazis cherished  hard work obedience to authority family life and about the terrorists who are bunglers dreamers chaotic buffoons whose war against the bourgeoisie is merely a carnival arranged by the elite class to promote itself. The terrorists for all their bravado and antics are pretty good for nothing and trapped in a paradigm of male domination of the female as if being a male chauvinist pig were a radical antibourgeois move. Fassbinder's view of then contemporary Germany was bleak  it was a country being punished for the sins of the fathers even unto the third generation. I doubt whether if Fassbinder were alive and turning his vision on our present situation he would consider that those sins had been expiated yet.".

Like that film it features bold striking compositions and rich colours that are perfectly saturated and stylized to the right amount. The Third Generation was made in 1979 two years after the German Autumn the crackdown of the BaaderMeinhof gang. Despite it's topicality however Fassbinder's film is about the future about the world of tomorrow as exemplified by it's evocation of sciencefiction masterpieces like Solaris mentioned and cited in this film the casting of the star of Alphaville Eddie Constantine as the head of a computer business organization and the constant presence of technology in this film either offscreenspeakers and recording equipment or onscreenTV screens and later guns and bombs. The score by Peer Raben is appropriately electronic.The story of The Third Generation is hard to summarize or describe and most people won't understand one bit of this film when they see it for the first time. See it twice and thrice and then it adds up. The story is just as fragmented as the personalities and lives of it's characters. The terrorist cell at the center of the film is a group of mostly middleclass misfits and apathetic junkies who are a mass of unresolved tensions and contradictions. Bulle Ogier's a stern history teachercrucially introduced to us discussing the 1848 revolution in Prussia but she's also a wouldbe feminist who submits to becoming a sex toy of Paul the leader of the group. Hanna Schygulla is your average bubbly corporate secretary but she's also carrying out a sadomasochistic affair with her fatherinlaw. Most of these terrorists activities for the first half are relegated to living in an apartment of a drug addicted young girl later joined by her former boyfriend and his friend. Their activities here are confined to juvenile games and irritating each other out of their skulls later extended to breakingandentering and bank robbery. The sole murder committed by them is revenge acted out by a submissive over the dominant.The actions of the police the business interests the government bureaucracy however is that of selfjustification of ruthless exercise of power and repression whose machinery ultimately incorporates these terrorists willingly and unwillingly.The relation of this film to our currentday hellhole needs little elaboration. This is a film for the 21st Century the children of the third generation one just as compromised and confused as it's forebears.".

	schema:headline " The Devil Probably";
	schema:reviewBody "The first generation was that of '68. Idealists who wanted to change the world and imagined they could do that with words and demonstrations. The second the BaaderMeinhof Group went from legality to armed struggled and total illegality. The third's the generation of today which simply acts without thinking which has neither a policy nor an ideology and which certainly without realising it lets itself be manipulated by others like a bunch of puppets.  Fassbinder Rainer Werner Fassbinder opens The Third Generation with an inscription which reads Dedicated to someone who truly loves  so to no one probably a nod to Robert Bresson made overt by the following shot in which a camera floats above a cityscape and lands on a television screen. The screen's showing the climax of Bresson's The Devil Probably a film which Fassbinder adored.The power of Generation's opening shot is only appreciated with an understanding of what's happening at the climax of Bresson's Devil. Here a student radical called Charles casts aside the hope and possibility of revolution and decides instead to commit suicide an act which he views as a form of radical nonparticipation. If I did anything Charles says then I'd be useful in a world that disgusts me. Charles initially flirts with active resistance of course but eventually rejects all shocks to the system outright. Pay a dollar for dynamite and you're already feeding the machine you want to injure. Under capitalism  which Bresson labels the Devil guiding all things a kind of parody of Smith's Invisible Hand  no one is an innocent bystander and contrary to those who believe in the superneutrality of money all participants are perpetrators of violence. For Charles it is simply easier to imagine the end of all life than the end of his politicaleconomic system. A system which because it consists of an endless Eternal Now no longer allows for a future. Ironically Fassbinder has Bresson's climax which literally captures the death of a certain revolutionary spirit Fassbinder considered himself a utopian anarchist played on a television set perched in the office of an ultra rich megacorporate head. The onscreen death seems to birth the very Empire in which the television sits and Bresson's film seems to itself play on a perpetual loop within this office like a religious sacrament worshipped by those who owe their wealth to Charles' death.Of course what all great directors were concerned about during this period was the question of where political and revolutionary agency now lies and why the political radicalism hopefulness and sense of urgency of the 1960s quickly morphed into disillusionment and despair and the resultant rise in escapism the Blockbuster apoliticism etc. As examples see Antonioni's Zabriskie Point Hadewijch Godard's numerous filmed essays particularly La Chinoise or even more mainstream fare like Full Metal Jacket where our hero smugly believes himself to be an enlightened non participant.Generation takes the form of a dark farce about a gang of West Berliners who decide to create a terrorist cell. Fassbinder however paints the group as a bundle of bumbling idiots enamoured by adventure and radicalism and carrying out violent attacks dressed in cartoonish costumes. They plan to kidnap multinational kingpin P.J Lurz in the name of the people for the good of the people but are oblivious to the fact that Lurz Eddie Constantine mimicking Yves Montand in CostaGavras's State of Siege owner of a multinational security firm is dependent on their very terrorism to boost sales and legitimise the importance of defence contracts. In other words capitalism monetises radicalism and terrorism fortifies rather than undoes reactionary power structures. Or as Fassbinder himself says terrorism is an idea generated by capitalism to justify better defence measures to safeguard capital.The film's terrorist cell is based on the Red Army Faction aka the BaaderMeinhoff Gang a group of ultra leftist radicals active in Germany between the 1970s and late 1990s but it echoes even contemporary history. Think BushCheney and later the coopted Arab Spring. Beyond Bresson Goddard's La Chinoise also plays a big influence Fassbinder using Goddardian title cards freeze frames onscreen text chapters and aural tricks. His dense walls of sound perhaps allude to Germany's increasingly right wing media adept at exploiting public hysteria and the everyday chatter of information technology which dulls and distracts rather than informs its audience. Indeed most of the film is bathed in the sounds emitted from TVs computers and radios their intrusive warbles forever shaping Fassbinder's characters.The title of Arthur Schopenhauer's 1819 opus The World as Will and Representation is used as a password by the terrorists but they largely miss the point of Schopenhauer's text. For the gang one's willpower changes the world. For Schopenhauer however one's will and desires undermine knowledge reason and are always subjugated to a larger universal Will impersonal forces which shape all lives. Following the will's dictates Schopenhauer believed leads to self deception suffering and the worshipping of mere representations rather than what's real. He advocated getting rid of the will which today echoes many tenets of Buddhism. And so one of the ironies of Fassbinder's film is that the very structure of the terrorist organisation resembles exactly that which they fight against with its rigid hierarchical structure and sexist power hungry opportunists.The film is divided into several chapters titled You always pull the short straw male samesex relations but with no S and M opposite sex relations xenophobia as a reflection of the violence between conservatives and liberals sadomasochism and Killroy was here the latter two titles alluding to the interpersonal dynamics which permeate the film Slave desperately seeks master to train me as his dog! one card reads and the lasting effects of the United States' presence in West Germany. 8.510  Though hastily written Fassbinder regarded Generation as his fourth best film. Multiple viewings required.".

The second generation were those who acted out of their understanding and compassion for what the first generation fought thus several of them were lawyers who used to defend the terrorist of the first generation.However around the middle of the 70ies in Germany a third generation arose but her motives were neither idealistic nor solidaric but allegedly legitimated by their actions. Therefore this hard to understand movie circles around the metaphysical question if actions can be selflegitimating or not and their political consequences. The montage of Fassbinder's film suggests an almost total loss of coherence the scenes are connected rather hazardly by abrupt cuts. Moreover Fassbinder uses one of his favorite media of style the soundcollage. In The Third Generation he combines three and more sound levels and in addition TVbroadcasting videoregistrations and more so that the omnipresent media have started a life of their own we understand nothing anymore. Obviously according to the film director only when this stage of despair is reached our actions are selflegitimating but mostly because all sense is gone.".

The plot explores the concept of terrorism and the contradictions of the middle class and apparently the central idea is based on Schopenhauer's central work. Unfortunately I do not have knowledge in philosophy sociology or political science to fully understand this inaccessible film. Fassbinder uses unusual angles with his camera and strange sounds to expose with irony the bourgeois values of each ridiculous terrorist of this generation that does not have ideology.

	schema:reviewBody "I went into The Third Generation quite frankly not expecting it to be a blackasdeath comedy of errors. I was under the impression perhaps misinterpreted by a description on a netflix DVD that Satan's Brew was Fassbinder's only real comedy. But as it turns out The Third Generation is one not merely in its context but in the form this is one of the Fassbinder films that owes far less to the melodramas one sees throughout his career than to Godard who was also a big influence if only as I've heard to beat his prolific output. Specifically in The Third Generation one can see Fassbinder in telling this loosely episodic and original story of Berlin terrorists a challenge to what was already a great challenge with La Chinoise how to show on film how absurd a terrorist group really is how it functions when not absolutely clear and concise like a bunch of manwomenchildren and how the form of the film the style has to go with that.Damn it all if this isn't such a warped movie. I don't even mean that just in its characterizations though there is some of that but in the nature of its filming the contradictions between the content and the style and the nature of overlapping sound. Please do pay attention to how sound is used in The Third Generation it's the kind of relentless assault that at least in this facet comes closest to Godard's attack on cinema. There's very rarely a scene where it's just silent and often the sources go on top and blend into one another with characters speaking dialog and then music eitherandor the very experimental compositions and instrument choices by Peer Raben or incidental and then usually a televisionvideos or other dialog or something else entirely.It certainly can contend with Altman as having the most sophisticated sense of sound editing but it's not just this or even those perfectly lurid transitions taken from writings on bathroom walls and stalls again a twist on Godard's chapterbreakup Fassbinder's savage satire is about the contradiction of a society that is so alienated that they are literally trapped in their houses most days and nights while scrambling for some kind of plan they wait and plot to enact. Fassbinder's camera which for this he was his own DoP does sometimes move fast like say in the shooting scene at the restaurant watch the fast pan to his face not expected but very effective but a lot of the time it stays still or moves slowly in on a room on faces or a situation unfolding like with the naked woman compulsively stealing money. But there's other scenes where it's just maddening in the best possible way to see what he'll shoot like when the snitch is rambling on and on to the Inspector about You're his father You're father is his grandfather repeatedly as if in a cokehead trance as the camera does long takes barely moving on this insane scene happening in front of us.What ultimately separates a radical like Godard and a radical like Fassbinder however is perspective. For a short period Godard was actually on the side of the revolutionariesterrorists in France however many there were in the heat of 1968 even if arguably La Chinoise worked best as a subtle or unintentional attack on such misguided 20somethings. Fassbinder on the other hand hated these bastards in Berlin the youth groups who kept starting up stuff to the point where he moved to Paris and decided to do his own kind of lampooning if you will. Some parts aren't funny at all such as the junkie overdose or the implication of the higherups like Eddie Constantine's character actually fronting the terrorists money or of course Gunther Kauffman's own path and moments as a character. Other parts like the shootout in the street with the gang in dragweird costumes would make any surrealist wet their pants in gleeful obscene laughter.What makes The Third Generation so invigorating a piece of cinema is its distinctive style its approach to taking a stance practically politically with its barrage of sound and deliberately methodical camera movements and the rapidfire cutaways to other things happening in other rooms or buildings or moments. But also the nature of this groupthink mentality of which there's so few really good films let alone possibly great ones. It's a seriocomic experiment in Gonzo moviemaking from someone who knows his stuff.".

The Third Generation lacks the emotional complexity and uniqueness of tone of the director's best work. Here we are allowed to know how to feel as long as we catch the film's BIG MESSAGE. West German radicals tried to burn the print of this movie when it was released in 1979 and its not hard to see why it pissed them off so much. Fassbinder is telling us that the nolonger young New Left has in West Germany at least not so much sold out to the establishment as been coopted by it. Revolutionary violence is only another tool of the capitalist state to justify its increasingly mechanistic systems of surveillance and control. This theme and the film's plot could have the potential to be a wonderful downer. But Fassbinder's misanthropy makes it difficult for the viewer to care that the main characters are caught in a trap. One has the sense that Fassbinder is shrugging his shoulders and saying Society is a cesspool and can't be otherwise because humans are irredeemable assholes. This might be true but it's not an attitude that elicits narrative or thematic connection on the part of the audience. The quality of the film making however is quite high. The movie was made on a very small budget and Fassbinder served as his own DP. This was a relatively late work in the director's brief career and by this time he had a very fine eye with some memorably bizarre imagery particularly late in the film and a wonderfully subterranean soundtrack.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die dritte Generation or The Third Generation is a West German Germanlanguage film from the year 1979 so this one will soon have its 40th anniversary. The writer and director is Rainer Werner Fassbinder and it is among his later works. He died 3 years later an untimely death at the age of 37. This is one of the films by him where he really unleashes and what worked very well with Satansbraten did not work out so well here. The film is overthetop and ignores all kinds of restrictions. The reason I did not like it is because it just didn't fit the topic. This is one of Fassbinder's most political movies and it's obvious he was very much influenced in his work by the big issue of leftwing terrorism in the FRG back then. But with some of the scenes and dialogues the film loses all its seriousness in my eyes. The cast once again includes several familiar names from his movies such as Carstensen Kaufmann Schygulla and Spengler. So if you have seen some other works by Fassbinder you will definitely recognize some familiar faces. I personally can see though why this film was not received so well by awards bodies despite the political relevance it had without a doubt back then. I have to give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

As it turned out Feo Aladag is an Austrian actressdirector married to TurkishGerman author Zuli Aladag who is also the producer of Die Fremde. I mention this because I think it is important. In this film the Turkish community in Germany is not pictured in a very favourable way. The story shows the fate of Umay a young TurkishGerman woman who wants a divorce because her husband beats her and because perhaps more importantly she doesn't love him. She leaves her husband and moves with her young son to her family in Berlin. Surprisingly her father and brother take sides with her husband and urge her to return to him. In their view she has dishonoured her husband and her own family by separating her son from his father. This conflict escalates in a dramatic way with terrible consequences. The film pictures Umay as a woman who is denied her 'Western' rights as a woman and a mother and shows her family as driven by 'nonWestern' values like honour and tradition. For them the community is superior over the individual. For her it's the other way round. The message is pessimistic. Umay is a Turkish woman who adopts the German lifestyle. She wants to live her own life. She follows the integration model that the Turkish people in Western Europe are supposed to follow. But her brother and sister don't support her although they are born and raised in Germany. They speak the German language but think the Turkish way. Like some of the films of Faith Akin in which lead actress Sibel Kekilli also starred this film focuses on the problems of the Turkish community in Germany.

	schema:headline " A simple story casting deep shadows on great problems";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is very realistic. Its detailed depiction of one Turkish family living in Berlin casts overtones for a greater problem of European multiculturalism. But forget the wider scope of those implications for now. The film is very focused on Turkish culture within Germany and one of its great weaknesses what it considers to be saving the honor of the family. The older daughter in the film has left her violent and abusive husband in Turkey and moved back to her family in Germany. Her parents immediately side with her husband and they repeatedly ask the daughter to return to him. But the daughter has sacrificed much to get away and will not return. After an attempt to kidnap her son and return him to the father fails she moves out...and moves again...and moves again as problems mount. Her younger brother and sister although initially supportive of her slowly begin to turn against her as the shame of her living independently with child causes the Turkish community to isolate the family. This ultimately leads to a final decision by the men in the family with tragic results. The family is Muslim although Islam is not portrayed as the reason why the family is shamed by the older daughter. In the culture it is easy for an independent woman to bring shame to the family especially if she leaves her husband. At no time do the parents ever seriously consider the perspective of their daughter. It is quite clear she has to maintain the family honor at all costs which in this case means returning to her husband. As the daughter continues to make unwise choices by maintaining contact with her family because she loves them the unwritten codes of this honor system will drive the family into greater acts of cruelty. This film can make you very angry indeed at the injustice to women done by patriarch based communal cultures. The honor that they cling to is so twisted. It is based on a superficial sense of righteousness that has little basis in truth. It is more concerned with appearances than justice. More concerned with blind obedience than righteousness. And that concept is promoted in Islam though not exclusively. This film should be mandatory viewing for any woman in similar straits as the main character in the film who has needed to separate from the family for safety. The Germans have provided good resources for such women but they are advised For now avoid contact with your family. One of this beautifully done film's main points is Once you leave or are forced to leave the family it may be for good. You cannot expect your family to sympathize with you support you or even accept you as family. There is a good chance they WILL turn against you if the community slanders the family. And a woman who leaves her abusive husband lives alone calls the police for safety or takes any action to safeguard her life and livelihood may very well be thought of as nothing more than a whore by the rest of the German Turkish community. Contact your family again at risk to your life! I would wish that Turkish men those who are perpetrators that is who see this would also feel ashamed for some of their sexist standards but I don't know if they would...The film is very moving and well done. The actors all fulfill their roles particularly the leading lady. The eye communication of the cast is extremely profound leaving you wondering about all of the unspoken thoughts stewing in their heads. The writing allows sympathy with all of the characters while still clearly pointing out who is right and who is wrong. You see they all have deep passions about righteousness. It's just that some are righteous and others are not. It is a simple story that casts deep shadows on complexities of cultural clashes. This is not a film that will break grounds in cinematography but it is a brave film and urgent as the Muslim both immigrant and native population rises in Europe. Hopefully this will start a trend that will cause the Turkish culture to think about what true honoring of the family really is.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is very realistic. Its detailed depiction of one Turkish family living in Berlin casts overtones for a greater problem of European multiculturalism. But forget the wider scope of those implications for now. The film is very focused on Turkish culture within Germany and one of its great weaknesses what it considers to be saving the honor of the family. The older daughter in the film has left her violent and abusive husband in Turkey and moved back to her family in Germany. Her parents immediately side with her husband and they repeatedly ask the daughter to return to him. But the daughter has sacrificed much to get away and will not return. After an attempt to kidnap her son and return him to the father fails she moves out...and moves again...and moves again as problems mount. Her younger brother and sister although initially supportive of her slowly begin to turn against her as the shame of her living independently with child causes the Turkish community to isolate the family. This ultimately leads to a final decision by the men in the family with tragic results. The family is Muslim although Islam is not portrayed as the reason why the family is shamed by the older daughter.

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen that the previous reviews on the movie also focused on describing the maledominant concept existing in very Turkish culture. I will choose not to proceed with that part primarily but only will share my impressions on the movie itself.However I should still note that these fictitious series of events filmed are not unfortunately far away from the many that are actual and real life stories. Positive Impressions Sibel Kekilli appears to have pulled off a very good job with acting. Her role shares many things in common with the one she had in Head On Gegen die WandDuvara Karsi. Her acting was obviously one of the major factors that would significantly influence the overall score she definitely did a good job.The script itself is generally very realistic mostly good at simulating a similar incidence that could have happened. It has errors to a certain level from where I look which I will share later on. Dynamics of this family with their sensitivity to gossips within their society and the type of expressions they use to deal with things etc. is projected quite accurately. There is a problem with technical depiction of the family that I will point later on.Negative ImpressionsThe family itself as it has been accurately pointed in one of the other reviews does not support their suggested background. This corrupted social understanding is righteously attributed in one other reviews to have become a method even independent from Muslim culture itself. Different backgrounds carry different amounts of this understanding. One family would have minded just a little bit whereas the second would condemn their daughter at any chance and a third would decide to eliminate the problem. The third type of family is usually if actually not always belong to a very rural background. This third type of family pictured in the photo didn't reflect such a background with the way they look or the way they talk. Umay's husband even an accurate choice with his looks sounded way too urban in the first minutes of the movie. Umay's mother while with a rural way of talking in the first half gradually transformed to a typical Istanbul lady with her pronounciation. The older brother was the best among others whereas he alone couldn't suffice to keep the picture intact with the suggested background of the family. I believe a family image with sharper edges would have kept the picture more appropriate within the borders of realism.I would like to underline once more that the suggested background exists and is projected just tothepoint with choice of expressions family members use whereas members themselves technically failed to give the impression of a thirdtype family. As pointed once more in another review you can never expect Turkish men to stop looking ahead and start watching their children while they are praying. While doesn't seem like a big issue for the whole movie it essentially degrades the charm of the movie on viewers who are familiar with the culture. I have also been thinking several things about the plot without coming to a final conclusion about what could have been better. It's kind of complicated with why Umay goes to the sister's wedding... She promised her sister about it but she also recently moved away when her brother found out about where she lives. I'm not perfectly sure with the accuracy of realism here. However it seems quite possible for a young lady who is so suppressed under clash of cultures to act emotional as her conscious gets unfortunately less and less comfortable about the way she treated her family.  Also the younger brother slapping Umay in the wedding who has also been motivated to shoot her has been closer to making sense side of the shore during first half of the movie. He actually didn't seem to be really vulnerable to possible manipulations in the house as he was apparently integrated deeper to the culture of the country. However he was young and he was also under high supression which can somehow justify his vulnerability.  I am also not very satisfied with the ending sequence. An older brother waiting with a knife in the corner for the younger brother to shoot the sister with a gun then taking the job over when the younger fails. It's quite suspicious why he didn't pull the child off before going for some stabbing. I would picture an evening scene in some silent corner of the city where the kid would be taken away by younger brother to somewhere else and Umay would have been killed by the older one. Finally I am not perfectly sure if a complete outsider to the whole thing would get the concept and dynamics of the social structures in the movie. The movie itself did quite a good job with it it's only about imagining reaction of a perfect strange to the culture and this content. I naturally cannot be objective since I already have knowledge about the whole thing. Even I have noted many negative impressions at the end of the day with a Turkish way of saying something this movie is generally very real. The chain of events apart from the technical depiction of the family definitely make sense since there are unfortunately similar real life incidents continuing to happen every year. It is a good feeling to see an abovetheaverage attempt on screen for giving a chance to every individual to leave anything else than their sole humanity outside the theatre and watch and think.".

	schema:reviewBody "Feo Aladag's debut feature comes to you with such a powerful presence that it is unlikely anyone will falter under her silver screen plea of sincerity and truth about violence against women and their rights under religious restraints. This narrative drama is void of plot clichs and feels a lot like a documentary convincing of an illfated woman's horrible chapter captured on film.Austrian actress Aladag's first feature film is powerful and overwhelming for the film community depicting a Muslim woman's struggle for freedom and human rights in the light of religious complications. It is made with such rawness that is almost too convincing as a drama genre film feeling more like a documentary on the big screen. There is almost no single scene in it that makes you go Hmm that is scripted even though it is by Aladag herself.We are looking at superb directing and writing here by a first time feature filmmaker which is a wonderful surprise that leaves us craving for more of her works to come. Perhaps it is her passion to promote antiviolence against women as well as women's rights allowing her to be devoted towards this film as a mass media tool of propaganda for a good cause.I for one am very convinced and inspired by her film.Sibel Kekilli previously earning accolades for HeadOn deserves Oscar nomination worthy recognition for her portrayal of Umay as she manages her emotions so well to evoke strong feelings within the audience. I felt so much for Umay and her son Cem wondering how can such tragedy befall upon them and at some points experiencing this passive urge to extend my helping hand towards them.No film has ever made me feel this way.Aladag illustrates the modern European society's concerns over integrating Muslim immigrants into the EU community where the line to draw between intercultural tolerance and interference is vaguely debatable. Just how much can one's deprival of basic human rights be justified by any religion the very one that supposedly exists to give us hope security and moral guidance?Pressurised by how the conservative Muslim community judges their family based upon Umay's individual revolt against norms her family becomes very uptight and volatile regarding the new found woe and remains adamant against her doings. There is very little act of love revealed under their furious demeanour throughout the film but I do believe that Umay does hold a place in their hearts no matter how small it is becoming. Her religious family has perhaps overtly regarded faith as the utmost authority that cannot be defied one that even transcends blood ties.Interestingly her two brothers played an integral part in conveying the sentiments of the young Muslim generation. Both brothers did not know what they should do except by faith and teachings since young to always follow the intentions of their parents. None of them tried to hold rational family discussions to speak on this where everything is decided by the head of the family. With their parents heavily stuck in the mud of traditional values and culture intolerance the brothers eventually caved in and followed suit to resist their sister.Umay and Cem are being illtreated by her abusive husband coerced sexual activities and violence leaves him and runs home to her family who regards her act as a shameful disgrace. Umay's father mentioned that upon marriage she belongs to her husband. Does that mean that she has to suffer silently even when her husband tears off a limb or two from her or even end her life? It is also cruelly brought up that when her family has to choose between the community and Umay they will never choose her.These are questions that one has to ask oneself regardless of religion and cultural background.In 2005 23 yearold Hatun Src was shot to death by her youngest brother at the instruction of his family at a bus stop near her residence. This was classified as one of the shocking Honour killings trend in Germany where the father has actually ordered for the murder of his own daughter. Hatun was married against her will to her cousin for eight years and decided to leave him with her then five yearold son. Hatun was pursuing an education and an internship as an electrician after she left her husband.This film follows with reference to the 2005 tragedy but the ending though similarly unfortunate in nature is not the one as mentioned above. So no spoilers pertaining to the film's ending.A simple issue of a woman's illtreatment by her abusive husband and her decision to leave her misery behind for a better life that everyone deserves. There is no religious implications here. It is not up to God to decide who should be illtreated or deprived of human rights it is up to us to stop violence and unjust treatment as fellow human beings. Sadly although the misfortune of Umay and Hatun was derivative of religious intolerance the entire affair has nothing to do with religion.Umay has removed her head scarf in the film ever since her family disapproves of her intentions. This may be deemed as her disregard of and revolt against religion but I feel that it is more of a revolt against unjustified suppression of her personal freedom and rights. Her removal of her scarf may simply imply that it has nothing to do with religion.Just as what Umay's superior has said to her father during an unannounced home visitLeave Him out of it God has nothing to do with this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Austrian actress Feo Aladag's directorial debut touches upon the concept of namus which has been treated many times before. Namuswhich is roughly translated as honor is a femalebound ethical category in patriarchal societies. It is ostensibly a part of the traditionalist Muslim societies but the concept namus actually predates Islam and the JudeoChristian religion. Regarded as the perfect form of female appropriateness todaynamus in time lost its connection with religion and became an expression of hidebound traditionality.What makes this concept a popular subject for the cinema makers is the fact that the very concept does not set any rules for men in uberconservative societies.In such a society males are supposed to control the women in their families. The fact that men are unaccountable for their actions while women should act perfectly along the line of appropriateness shows that namus came to be social mores that has not much to do with religion. In the movie Sibelli Kekilli plays a battered housewife who has been continuously abused by her husband. When she can't take it anymore she decides to go back to her family in Germany. Her family gives her a chilly welcome when they realize she is planning to leave her husband. Presumably from a generation of Gastarbeiter the family is utterly conservative and a daughter's coming back to family with her kid and ending her marriage is unthinkable for them no matter how violent her husband would be. No matter how many times it has been treated before the subject is a humanitarian one.It is not difficult to denounce the tartuffery of pious morality but you need to get credits for that. Die Fremde does not exactly offer a thoughtprovoking portrait of a damsel in distress.It feels like shouting at your face and telling you I have thought of everything for you. Umay pursues an effectively independent way for herself and her son. She leaves her husband she even leaves her family when she realizes that they will take her son from her. What does she do then? In spite of the warnings of foster home authorities she continues to see her family. Though she gets physically attacked by her brother she goes to her sister's wedding. Is that the way a girl who wants be independent should act? Why should a girl who has found a sweetcaring boyfriend who wants be a father for her kid be a pathetic person? Feo Aladag criticizes the stubbornly prejudiced narrowminded and inflexible mores of this society but she just indulges in incoherences. When Umay's mother Halime Derya Alabora hears that her other daughter Rana Almila Bagriacik is pregnant from her boyfriend all she says is We're ruined. and the father just sighs when her wife says they must get married. In a family like the one in the movie Rana is supposed to be killed because of having blemished family's honor. What does the father do? The father chooses to pay the boy's father to get a definite marriage.Instead the family decides to kill the other daughter who can legally get a divorce.Let alone the fact the the characters do not act like a Turk when the conversation turns into Turkish the characters do not sound as natural as they sound in Turkish.No TurkishMuslim watches his son's imitative praying instead of following the imam during the salat in the mosquethey do not really give the reactions you expect from a traditionalist family. Sibel Kekilli's acting is superb but the story remains unconvincingslipping too easily into melodrama and a series of incoherent scenes.".

The father chooses to pay the boy's father to get a definite marriage.Instead the family decides to kill the other daughter who can legally get a divorce.Let alone the fact the the characters do not act like a Turk when the conversation turns into Turkish the characters do not sound as natural as they sound in Turkish.No TurkishMuslim watches his son's imitative praying instead of following the imam during the salat in the mosquethey do not really give the reactions you expect from a traditionalist family. Sibel Kekilli's acting is superb but the story remains unconvincingslipping too easily into melodrama and a series of incoherent scenes.";

The film is written and directed by Feo Aladag a German woman who is very familiar with the culture of Turkish families living in Germany.Umay played with outstanding skill by Sibel Kekilli is a young woman who grew up in Germany but who lives with her husband and his family in Turkey. Umay lives within the strictly patriarchal traditional society of Turkey which includesin her casebeing beaten by her husband. She takes her young son with her and escapes to Germany where her family lives.The remainder of the movie concerns Umay's attempt to reintegrate herself into her family and into mainstream German culture. Although she is treated well by the Germans with whom she has contact she is barely toleratedat bestby her family.When Umay learns that her brother is planning to kidnap her son and send him back to Turkey she leaves again and goes to what appears to be a shelter for battered women.Although she is treated well at the shelter she cannot bear to cut herself off from her family. She keeps returning and keeps being rejected sometimes psychologically sometimes physically. She keeps hoping that their real love for her will overcome the humiliation they feel because her behavior is considered shameful.The acting in this film is outstanding and there are no weak links. However I have to single out the young boyCemplayed by Nizam Schiller. He is uncannily believable as a child who can't understand why he must move and then move again and yet again.We saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester NY. However it will do well on DVD. Incidentally the original title Die Fremde means strangers or foreigners. This title is more accurate than the U.S. title because Umay and Cem are foreigners wherever they go.This film is relatively long and very grim. There is one scene of high spirits as Umay and a young German man ride through Berlin on a motorbike but it doesn't ring true. All the rest is grim grimmer and ultimately grimmest.I'm not going to reveal the ending. The reason I labeled this review as a spoilera first for meis that potential viewers should know that this is a great film but it is extremely depressing. You can't walk out of the theater or get to the end of the DVD and just move on. So it's a mustsee film but only if you can handle the emotional consequences.".

More than a few scenes were simply yelling and slapping which I've found quite raw. The closeups were nice generally with beautiful faces occasionally with oblique views.

As a side note I just have to point out that the subject of film has little to do with religion or being a muslim. The problem is far too deep which is really a sociological phenomena rooted in dogmatic cultural upbringings and a feudal life style mostly of the eastern part of country where people are just a dot in the family picture rather than individuals with autonomy.

Die Fremde When We Leave probably a better translation would be The Strangers is a story about Umay a young woman living with her husband and son in Istanbul. To protect the child and herself from an oppressive marriage she decides to leave the husband and move back to her family in Germany. Her father confronted with the choice whether to support and protect his daughter or to be publicly humiliated by the Turkish community decides to comply with established social norms and wants to send them back to Turkey. Umay refuses to go but the family is determined to send the child back to the father. From this point the story describes Umay's attempts to protect the child from being taken from her and regain acceptance of her family as a single mother. The movie made tremendous impression on me. Watching was a real life changing experience. The most impressive aspect was definitely Umay's character played by Sibel Kekilli. There is something magnificent about her. I believe I learned more from Umay about the love acceptance and forgiveness than from all the years spent in church. On the negative side I didn't really like the ending but you can't win them all. I was curious to find out what critics have to say about the movie. Interestingly most of them missed the main theme. The movie is not about a Muslim women trying to embrace Western values of personal integrity and freedom or clash of the cultures. Umay was born in Germany her best friend is a NonMuslim and apparently she is very well adopted into Western society. This is a story of a mother who is dedicated to the wellbeing of the child and she does not want to compromise his happiness because of any social expectations whether they are coming from Western Society or from Islam religion. As such the story is universal and applicable to theists and atheists East and West. Probably one of the best movies I've ever seen and certainly the most influential.".

Even Acar is forced to confront the lost of family honor.The portrait of the lost of family honor is devastating. The pressure feels real. The need for Umay to reconnect with her family does feel unreasonable and excessive. I doubt a reasonable Umay would show up at the wedding. After the wedding it seems impossible for her to go to the hospital especially carrying her son with her. Then the final scene has too many twists. It only accentuates the twisty manufactured nature of the writing. Writerdirector Feo Aladag needs to tone down some of the more melodramatic developments in the last act.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Fremde or When We Leave is a GermanTurkish production from 6 years ago. The movie won awards all over the world and was picked as Germany's submission to the Academy Award for the foreign language category. But it was not chosen for a nomination sadly got snubbed just like The Edge of Heaven a couple years earlier. I guess German films with this multicultural background just are not to the Academy's liking. Well.. it is their loss as these 110 minutes here are an absolutely outstanding achievement and a truly positive step into filmmaking by writer and director Feo Aladag. And equally much praise from me goes to lead actress Sibel Kekilli who is in basically every scene of the film and delivers a stunning portrayal as a young Turkish womanmother whose terrible actions she got divorced has a German boyfriend won't give up on her son... resulted in her being humiliated by her family and becoming an outcast. Yet it is not so easy as she does not want to give up on them and there are moments when they don't seem to give up on her either. It is nice to see that performances like these got her into Game of Thrones even if I am not a fan of the series. I hope she can keep having a great career also abroad. She deserves all the praise and accolades she gets.Umay the main character gets humiliated emotionally and occasionally also physically from start to finish here. Kekilli delivers a truly heartbreaking performance of a modern young woman whose love for her son is too big to be able to accept stupid nonsensical Turkish customs in terms of gender roles. If the man does not want to be with the woman any more it is all the woman's fault and she has brought shame upon her family. The concept of Ehrenmord honor killings is just the negative icing on the cake and it is unbelievable that this also still exists today. With stuff like this it is really hard to feel tolerance and sympathy for immigrants. Of course I am only referring to these that still believe in the concepts I mentioned before. With the ending you can argue if a less tragic outcome maybe with the film ending the moment her brother runs away may have been better but it's good both ways I think. Overall this film is a masterpiece and there is certainly some gigantic irony to the German Film Awards preferring the extremely forgettable Storm with a female lead that does not have 1 of Kekilli's greatness. Anyway Die Fremde is an absolute mustsee. Highly recommended.".

The kid who actually is the lead character is OK too and she brings a Home Alone feeling to this film.The only thing that made me a bit curious is whether people in the USA really think that Amsterdam is like the worst place on earth because I mean how could they?

The film has very strong kid appeal it was actually produced by Disney in Europe but contains a couple bits of graphic violence that earn it an R rating in the USA.".

The plot was quite good  mute girl lost in big city runs into trouble and can't ask for help but must fend for herself  although Jennifer Tilly's performance as the overanxious mother was too silly for words. Dick Maas should have known better as a Dutch director to use Tilly as a mouthpiece for erroneous myths about the Netherlands being full of lawless drug dealers.Some flaws  how come the mute girl was able to understand the Dutch dealer in the boat when he asks her old she is? He wouldn't have known she wasn't Dutchspeaking. Also the climatic chase sequence some of which I saw being filmed incidentally was very cutandpaste in terms of logical progression through the streets. Those of us who know Amsterdam were astonished to see Hartman heading for the Central station one minute and only seconds later being completely on the other side of town in the Vondelpark. It's as if Maas was determined to cram in as many landmarks as possible!Flaws aside it was a good oldfashioned action romp in many ways with some deft touches of humour and it was nice spotting some of the local personalities regularly seen around town. Good fun but don't expect any big statements!".

Also called 'Silent Witness' on DVD it's a wonder why such a weird awful script would attract high pedigree actors like William Hurt Jennifer Tilly and Denis Leary. Hurt and Tilly play a wealthy American couple on a business trip to Amsterdam with their little daughter Francesca Brown who happens to be a mute wearing a magic marker around her neck as sole means of communication. After getting separated from her parents at the hotel she inadvertently witnesses a murder by two nasty hitmen Corey Johnson and some other random and flees off into the night pursued by them and subjected to all kinds of whacked out freaks. Seriously this poor girl in terms of both the character and the actress is put through an unnecessary wringer of ultra violence and sleaze. There's this thread of implied child abuse running through the narrative as if such proclivities are inherent in Dutch people in that city and it's really troubling to see a girl her age have to be ogled by perverts at every turn an ill advised and shameful addition from some no name scriptwriter who probably never worked again. Then there's Denis Leary who should have sued the marketing team for misrepresentation. On the US DVD cover he leers off the poster with an evil gaze holding a gun and giving every impression that he's the film's villain. In the actual film he an innocuous American homeless man who helps the poor girl navigate the dangerous streets throughout the only sane individual she meets really. It's an alright role for the guy but that stupid box art really sells his presence askew. It's just a bizarre uneven disaster for the most part and I still wonder to this day why any of these fine actors participated. William Hurt especially is such a choosy performer usually handpicking excellent scripts and being careful with his career but here he jumps right into the abysmal script with some pseudo Southern accent that is way way beneath him. Should not be used as a tourism video for Amsterdam but rather forgotten permanently from the DTV landscape.".

	schema:reviewBody "Films based on videogames are commonplace nowadays but one thing I've never seen before is a film based on a board game! Clue is a murder mystery that takes its ideas from the popular game of Cluedo. I cant say I'm a fan of that board game although I sometimes play it on the quiz machine in pub but I am a fan of murder mystery  and while this film is more of a joke than anything it generally plays it's cards right and what we have here is a very entertaining little flick that really does deserve your time! The film shows it's experimental edge by having three endings which can be played at random on the DVD and throughout we are treated to a film that has it's audience in mind. Tim Curry is the big name on the cast list and he plays butler Wadsworth. He's in charge of a house whose master has invited six guests to his home. Naturally those guests are given the names of the people in Cluedo and include the likes of Colonel Mustard Mrs White and Miss Scarlet etc. We are then treated to a night of mystery as we try to uncover who murdered the host...and why! One criticism I could easily make of this film is that it doesn't really have a lot of plot. The mystery is very shallow and is over very quickly. This is only a shame because of the fact that I would have liked to see this go on for longer however as the energy that the cast brings to the table is priceless and really makes for a good time viewing. Tim Curry takes the lead role and does what he does best. Curry is famous for campy performances in camp films like this and his role as Wadsworth really does his reputation proud! The film does a very good job of keeping itself wide open and by the end it really could have been any of the characters behind the murder. This is good because it allows writerdirector Jonathon Lynn complete freedom over who committed the murder but it harms the film as the audience doesn't really get enough info to have a stab at it themselves. The style of the film suits the mood very well with oldfashioned clothes and decor giving it that classic mystery feel. Now don't get me wrong this isn't exactly a great film but it's a lot of fun and I can't see why anyone wouldn't enjoy it.".

As a child I loved the ending. The film manages to entertain me as an adult too.Are you brave enough to play along? High recommends! Frankly Scarlett I don't give a damn Wadsworth to Ms. Scarlet";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies that I would watch repeatedly and still holds up as a great source of entertainment for me. Based on the board game of the same name by Parker Brothers six guests Colonel Mustard Mrs. White Mr. Green Mrs. Peacock Professor Plum and Miss Scarlet are invited to a Victorian mansion for a dinner party. The host later reveals they are all being blackmailed and wanted to get everybody together to confront the perpetrator the alleged Mr. Boddy who later is murdered by one of the guests. What follows is an exciting and intriguing series of events of fingerpointing revealing secrets and motives  all leading to the thrilling investigation of the entire house for clues and Butler Wadsworth's reenactment of the night's events. All the characters gave a memorable performance each in hisher own unique flavor. The plot and story by Jonathan Lynn and John Landis with solid direction by Lynn are fastpaced and exciting as this movie constantly reminds you that there is a murderer on the loose and there are obvious suspects on screen for you to decipher! In addition I think John Morris' terrific music score enhances the mysterious feel of a murder mystery movie. The humor is great with Miss Scarlet's acid wit being my favorite. This is also one of those movies that you will find something new every time you watch it. Some downsides I believe were that some of the rooms like the Conservatory Ball Room and Billiard Rooms weren't used enough and Mr. Green's character was a little too melodramatic. But overall a fun comedy that never gets old.Grade A".

I'd say it's most like a cross between an elementary school play being put on by modestly paid adults actors with additional satirical social commentary and a higher class but lower budget version of the Saw series but with slightly less gore and much more politics. It's really a remarkable blend of horror satire mystery and above all brilliant comedy. Additionally the idea of 3 possible endings was far ahead of it's time and an impressive and innovative risk. I highly recommend watching this movie with each of the possible endings as none will disappoint and all will leave you speechless.".

The script is so witty and clever it seems like a modern Oscar Wildeadaptation. The actors and actresses help making it come to life. Even though I was mainly watching this for Christopher Lloyd who starred in Back To The Future that same year which is kinda hard to believe if you compare his looks in the two movies Tim Curry whose performance here seriously rivals all his other great roles like Frank 'N' Furter and Pennywise The Clown and Michael McKean great as ever the whole cast really blew me away because it had such a great on screenchemistry together.Up until the ending the three different endings that is Clue is one hell of an entertaining ride that doesn't bore you for a second. This one is a real sleeper one of the greatest and most overlooked comedies of the 80's. If you get a chance to watch it definitely do so!".

	schema:reviewBody "Jonathan Lynn's 1985 comedy Clue has got to be the BEST movie ever created! Based off of the famous board game Clue is a fantastic movie for people of all ages. I myself was drawn to this movie at the age of seven or eight and it has faithfully been my favorite movie ever since!The movie starts with six guests Mr. Green Colonel Mustard Professor Plum Miss. Scarlet Mrs. White and Mrs. Peacock all being invited to a large mansion in New England for a dinner party of which they know absolutely nothing about. At the party they all find out that they have more in common than they first realized and the murders begin starting with Mr. Boddy the seventh guest! And as the night goes on suspicion lands on each of the guests as well as the butler Wadsworth. So not only is the movie uproarious but it's actually a very intriguing mystery!The acting is absolutely spot on in Clue! Eileen Brennan plays Mrs. Peacock a talkative politician's wife. Madeline Kahn is Mrs. White my favorite character in the movie! Mrs. White is a widow who may have more to do with her husband's death than she's letting on! Christopher Lloyd does a terrific job as Professor Plum the ladies man wannabe! Michael McKean plays the hopelessly clumsy Mr. Green. Martin Mull is Colonel Mustard the man who tries to act as if he knows exactly what is going on. Lesley Ann Warren is awesome as Miss. Scarlet the temptress and of course you can not forget the amazing Tim Curry who plays cool and composed Wadsworth the butler.As I said before this is a movie for people of all ages. In fact just recently I got my sixyearold brother to watch it and he too claims it is his favorite movie! Does he understand every single joke? No of course not! But the upbeat fast pace of the movie has him watching it over and over and acting out the famous Wadsworth Explains Everything scene! I fully recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a good laugh and tons of fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "With regards to all the movie tieins to various games released this summer Final FantasyTomb raider Dungeons  Dragons I felt it was appropriate to review the film Clue which has the distinction of being the first film to have started  this trend so many years ago.Clue has a lot in common with the above big budget movies in that it too was based on a very popular game boardgame in this instance!! called Cluedo. And that's where the similarities end for unlike the other tiein duds this film is a very enjoyable and original film.The entertainment value of this film is remarkably high. Not only are we given an exciting whodunnit mystery but also an enjoyable comedy featuring many witty one liners and subtle injokes with a sprinkling of slapstick on top. One of the reviewers here the oddly named Abba owns me complains that the characters in this film are underdeveloped and are as wooden as their corresponding Player pieces that come with the Cluedo boardgame. But what Abba owns me fails to understand is that most murder mysteries normally do not delve too deeply into any character study of the suspect characters. Which leaves the viewer to focus on the solving the crime by noting the actions and responses of these suspect characters to the events happening around them. The fact that this film also emulates this trend is more of a strength than a weakness in that it is just as focused on it's murder mystery theme as well as it's comedic theme.Besides this the performances of the entire cast in this film are first rate especially  Tim Curry who steals this film with his over the top performance of Wadsworth the butler which I feel was his best one to date!!. It is not too hard to notice that the entire cast must have had a whale of a time making this film from watching their passionate and over the top performances. And kudos to the script writers for concluding the film with 3 different endings which was a very original concept that has never been imitated by any other film since then. All three endings that were released to cinemas separately are included in the VHS version my favourite being the 2nd ending. Clue also features an excellent soundtrack which denotes the fifties setting in which this film and boardgame  is based I particularily like the energetic piece of classic music that is played throughout the film.Clue is a wonderful film whose entry  excels in each of it's genres such as comedy murder mystery and of course the movie based on a game genre. Although the biggest mystery of this film is to why it has not transcended from VHS to DVD format as of yet!!!! I rate Clue 1010!!!!".

In one ending Miss Scarlet Lesley Ann Warren does the majority of the killing. That makes sense. In another Mrs Peacock does most of them in This however does not make sense. When she is apparently killing people on the first floor the film clearly shows her smaking the furnace in the dark. As is the last ending. In this ending each of the suspects kills someone. The problem here is again when the lights go out and Yvette The Cop  the singing telegram girl are all murdered then or so we are told in the ending. Mrs. White Madeline Kahn with some great lines I might add is supposedly the one who kills Yvette. Yet during the film we see her upstairs screaming her head off and backing up to a window. So my question is that how could people be in 2 places at one time? Still even though with the faults I have just mentioned I still LOVE this film. I only noticed these things after NUMEROUS viewings of this film. Most people will not pick up on this. At least not until after they have returned it to the video store.Great Cast! Great Acting!

It's my favourite role of Tim Curry's he's had thus far a wonderful career but he's extraordinarily charming and energetic he does not stop. Tim Curry apart it's the three female characters of Peacock Scarlet and White that make the film. Madeline Kahn is so sexy as femme fatale Mrs White Lesley Anne Warren has the most sensational figure although Dr who fans may agree when we first see her she looks like a vervoid. However it's Eileen Brennan's Mrs Peacock that I enjoy most she delivers some hilarious lines with a slick and easy manner. How cool is it to have a film with 3 different endings each is so good. 1010 a classic I never tire of i'd put it up there with Murder by Death it's that good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I mean this movie is just fantastic marginally better than Murder By death which I didn't understand at the end though that is a good film. With the costumes the actors and a gem of a script what could possibly go wrong? The script was hilarious. Every line was enough to make you fall off the chair. The Kingdom of Heaven bit was sidesplittingly funny because it was just so random. True it is nothing like the Board Game but the way they revolve it around the Board Game was so clever. Some of it was extremely silly but have a heart it's a comedy it's supposed to be. The casting was just ingenious. Eileen Brennan was just flawless giving Mrs Peacock a much needed bit of edge. Tim Cury stole every scene he was in and he looked  as always as though he was having the time of his life. Madeline Kahn was just hilarious especially with her line Husbands should be like Kleenex soft strong and disposable and the iconic Life before death is as improbable as sex after marriage. Christopher Lloyd seemed restrained but his dry humour made Professor Plum an unforgettable character. Michael McKean was a bit whiny but I don't care it's called acting plus Mr Green is supposed to be timid. Martin Mull has great comedic timing and brought a bit a stupidity to his role of Colonel Mustard. My favourite characterisation was that of Miss Scarlet played by Lesley Ann Warren looking gorgeous in that emerald green dress. Miss Scarlet was the closest characterisation to the board Game. Colleen Camp looked lovely and I liked the jokes about her boobs and Lee Ving part of a joke Leaving soon was very good too. The three endings were so funny very silly but it is like the Pink panther franchise it is all about the comedy. You would've never guessed the final solution in a million years because the third ending had me completely by surprise and I am not kidding. This movie is a mustsee for all Tim Curry fans like me. If you want to see more of this talented man check out Legend Rocky Horrorobviously and Stephen King's Ithis careerbest1010. Bethany Cox".

Clue is my favourite board game and I think everyone is familiar with it. Players have to solve the murder of Mr Boddy including who killed him and where and with what this is also a line of dialogue in the film. In order to sustain a movie the writerdirector Jonathan Lynn added several other murders and 3 different endings. The dialogue is very fast paced and incredibly witty. I would suggest watching the movie more than once just to catch all the lines. The acting is excellent all around. Tim Curry is amazing as Wadsworth the butler other favourites are Eileen Brennan as Mrs Peacock and the hilarious Madeline Kahn as Mrs White.

What can I say I love movies.This movie I like because it is a mystery and a comedy rolled into one. The cast that was assembled made this movie what it was. Tim Curry is great as Wadsworth the Butler. Martin Mull is awesome as Colonel Mustard. Lesley Ann Warren is pretty darn good as Miss Scarlet and beautiful too. So is Colleen Camp as Yvette. Christopher Lloyd is great as Professor Plum and Michael McKean is a convincing bumbling Mr. Green. I could go on but I won't.Again as has become my custom I have several favorite scenes which I will list.My first favorite scene is the three endings. The three endings are a series of endings in which the many different murders are explained. Wadsworth begins to explain how the cook the motorist Yvette Mr. Boddy the cop and the singing telegram girl. All three endings are slightly different giving the viewer a murder mystery feel as they try to figure out whodoneit.The next like of mine really isn't about any one scene in particular. I like the awkwardness of each character interacting with the others. The script calls for several of the character Wadsworth in particular to utilize double talk or using words that have double meaning. Some of it is confusing and the viewer almost gets lost in the conversation but in a weird way it's funny.The last part of Clue that I like is the sexual innuendo and the not so subtle sexual tension aspect of the script. Colonel Mustard Professor Plum and Mr. Boddy all hit on either Miss Scarlet or Yvette. Mr. Boddy attempts to feel up Yvette while at dinner but she steps away before he can get too far. Professor Plum did feel up Miss Scarlet by moving his hand to her rearend while waiting for the front door to open.I give this 8 Stars out of 10 only because it is out of date. Yes I know that it is period movie set in the early 1950's. However we are talking about a movie that hit the theaters nearly 30 years ago.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whenever I hear of a film based on a board game I almost always think it's going to suck. Battleship certainly wasn't amazing. Cluedo is a very fun and clever board game. Yet this film based on the board game is 10 times more fun. Clue has various guests at a house trying to solve a series of murders all of them played by fun actors in full on hilarious camp mode. This has 3 endings which are shown back to back on the Netflix version. Clue is simply one of the most fun comedies you'll ever watch. It's not for everyone as the camp tone and lack of seriousness may start to get on people's nerves after a while. Also I think one ending was enough. In terms of quality it's an 8 but in terms of enjoyment it's pretty much a 10. The script is so energetic you can almost see the sparks fly and it crackles with energy delivering hilarious joke after hilarious joke like a ballistic missile launcher while the direction is also well done. Although the 3 solutions do pile up all of them make sense and the mystery is rather difficult to solve.All of the actors especially Tim Curry are great and the sets are fun as well creating a campy sense of Gothic. Thankfully it doesn't stick entirely to the formula of the board game and allows itself to be its own movie. Because of the endlessly silly tone it is at the expense of actual tension but this adds to the movie a little at the same time. It's an acquired taste and if you want to see anyone take anything seriously look else where but this is without a doubt the most under appreciated comedy of all time. It gets a lot of bad reviews but it's incredibly funny it has loads of entertaining set pieces and the cast are awesome. Thankfully viewers have been less harsh on the film and it is a cult classic but it deserves to be more than that. Clue was a hugely pleasant surprise as I wasn't expecting much yet I was in full on maniacal laughter mode for the whole film. Campy silly clever and endlessly witty it is one of the most entertaining comedy films of all time. As for the critical critics.... get a clue! 810".

Whereas I liked Montreal my favorite has always been the Wembley set  which is almost identical here. The picture is as clear as I have ever seen footage of the band and the sound was crisp.I wasn't particularly fond of the inter cutting scenes on each band member wondering around Budapest having a moment. I would have rather this had been an optional feature on the disc not played in the middle of a song but that's just me. With regard to the Wembley concert Queen Live at Wembley Stadium I live in hope that this will be given the restoration treatment and put onto Blu Ray  I'm sure it would certainly sell well. Comparing that concert to this is not difficult but for me the audience are flatter here whether it's the camera work which is great of the band focusing on the band members more and the crowd participation and reactions less I can't tell but Wembley feels more immersive.Another minor gripe I don't know why Another One Bites the dust was left off the Blu Ray or why Crazy little thing called love was heavily trimmed in the edit?? The impromptu bits Brian's solo and the very touching Hungarian song Freddie sings are going to change depending on the location obviously  but as for the song set can't we have it all and complete?Shelling out for this set will also give you two CD's of the gig the less said about the crappy cardboard gatefold sleeve the better.Obviously a must for fans for people new to Queen's music I would recommend Wembley over this.".

It is a valuable social commentary on the mores and folkways of the time 1933 and explores the double standard then existent that condemned a woman for loose living' while exonerating a man.  The most interesting aspect of the film to me was the fact  that it was almost a mirror's image of the sea change that took place in morals during 1920's in the aftermath of World War I.RKO couldn't have picked a better actress to play the part of Ann Vickers. Irene Dunne was young sensitive brave intelligent  everything the modern woman' of the day was supposed to be. Her early professional career was marked by a series of skillfully done tearjerkers of which Ann Vickers is one of the better ones.I highly recommend this movie. Walter Huston did a fine job as Ann's second love and the man who restored her faith in a loving relationship. It's well directed and filmed and is a wonderful insight into life in the U.S. from just after World War I up until the middle of the Great Depression.".

Possibly a great deal of this film wound up on the cutting room floor. Edna May Oliver has a fine part as Dunne's mentor but she's abandoned a third of the way through the film and we don't know what happened.Dunne does well in a role that Katharine Hepburn would have hit a home run with and she does get good support from the rest of the cast.

Ann Vickers was one of Sinclair Lewis' most controversial books that covered such hot topics for the time as abortion women's voting rights sex and divorce not to mention a realistic appraisal of life in a women's prison. It was written in 1933 and by the end of the year had been turned into a glossy woman's picture starring an intelligent actress who was making Martyrdom movies her own domain  Irene Dunne. This is a super movie  why don't they make movies like this anymore! Yes it is a women's picture but not the sudsy Mrs. Miniver type that would become popular in the 1940s. Superlative Irene Dunne makes you believe in every scene she plays.She's going to make the world over  if it takes all winter says Malvina wonderful Edna May Oliver of her friend Ann Vickers Irene Dunne. Social worker Ann has a passion for helping people and when she meets disillusioned soldier Bruce Cabot playing a heel as usual she spends a blissful week with promises of marriage when he returns from the front. His letters become less frequent and when they accidentally meet at a restaurant she realises that he has forgotten all about her. After her baby dies she finds a job at a women's prison. Copperhead Gap Prison is grimespecially under Captain Waldo a lecherous Simon Legree type who yearns for the good old days of public floggings with the cat 'o nine tails and other nice amusements!!!

He is the man who through his high praise helped make her book a best seller and when they meet there is an instant attraction. Ann has found her soul mate  they are both intelligent and have high ideals. He is married  to a grasping woman who prefers to live abroad and will not give him a divorce. they embark on a relationship and when he is sent to prison by standing by him Ann loses her prestigious appointment. Trying to get friends to rally around her she has a showdown with Lindsay Atwell Conrad Nagel an old admirer and a part that probably made more sense in the novel. Ann is reduced to writing articles about prison reform from her small upstairs flat and when Barney is released finds Ann and their little boy waiting for him.With other stars this film may have been maudlin  but the superior acting skills of Dunne and Huston make this an extremely fine movie. J. Carroll Naish has a blink and you'll miss him part as a drunken doctor Gertrude Michael has a small scene as Barney's wife and if there is a prison matron in a movie chances are it's Mary Foy.Highly Highly Recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "When Merian C. Cooper replaced David O. Selznik as production head of RKO he continued the habit of acquiring literary works for filming. Ann Vickers was one of Sinclair Lewis' most controversial books that covered such hot topics for the time as abortion women's voting rights sex and divorce not to mention a realistic appraisal of life in a women's prison. It was written in 1933 and by the end of the year had been turned into a glossy woman's picture starring an intelligent actress who was making Martyrdom movies her own domain  Irene Dunne. This is a super movie  why don't they make movies like this anymore! Yes it is a women's picture but not the sudsy Mrs. Miniver type that would become popular in the 1940s. Superlative Irene Dunne makes you believe in every scene she plays.She's going to make the world over  if it takes all winter says Malvina wonderful Edna May Oliver of her friend Ann Vickers Irene Dunne. Social worker Ann has a passion for helping people and when she meets disillusioned soldier Bruce Cabot playing a heel as usual she spends a blissful week with promises of marriage when he returns from the front. His letters become less frequent and when they accidentally meet at a restaurant she realises that he has forgotten all about her. After her baby dies she finds a job at a women's prison. Copperhead Gap Prison is grimespecially under Captain Waldo a lecherous Simon Legree type who yearns for the good old days of public floggings with the cat 'o nine tails and other nice amusements!!! Ann is appalled at the harsh treatment the women receive  she witnesses lashings even hangings and when she is forced to leave writes a best seller that exposes the conditions of prison life.

The protagonist Ann Vickers is an independent woman a suffragette pursuing a career a woman who knows her mind and is determined to lead a life without a man's stamp of approval. She even has two illegitimate children. For 1934 this was definitely forward thinking even dangerously revolutionary. And so the first half of the film goes on this vein with Ann being refreshingly modern. I suspect that many women viewers identified with her dreams and struggles.And then the story grinds to a halt and Ann's life comes apart and all because her lover a corrupt judge is convicted and sent to jail. When she is forced to abandon her career it is made eminently clear that she owed her success to her once influential lover. All her hard work amounted to nothing once her powerful protector disappeared. Moreover she betrays her own ethical standards by pleading for her lover's freedom. So the implication is that love is the paramount motivating factor in a woman and Ann is reduced to a stereotype. She even waits for her man to get out of jail and learns to cook for him.Frankly I felt betrayed. I became involved in this woman's life and cheered her on only to discover that Hollywood lacked the courage to present a truly alternative lifestyle. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. After all 1934 was the year the dreaded morality code went into effect. Still Ann Vickers would have been a much better film if they had left well enough alone.".

She eventually falls for a controversial judge Walter Huston but this here might cost her everything she's worked for. This RKO film was produced by Merian C. Cooper the same year he made King Kong but that's the only thing the two films have in common. Dunne is good in her role but the film is all over the place and it's easy to see that the film is trying to cover several parts of the book but can't take everything in within the short running time. Huston stays under control and gives a winning performance as does Cabot and Conrad Nagel in his supporting role. Edna May Oliver and J. Carrol Naish also have small roles.".

	schema:headline " According to this film nice girls DO....again and again!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a bad film as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts. As a result it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud of making. However the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of PreCode films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put outeven if they aren't married and even if their partner IS!! The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to Europe for WWI. In the process she meets a scalawag Bruce Cabot who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. She becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However Miss Dunne does NOT want him back as she realizes he's not worth it but later her baby dies at child birth. While all these very controversial plot elements are used they are always alluded toalmost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kids in the audience will be clueless after all films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time.Surprisingly this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about 14 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to. It was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned ittacking it on to still another film. In this second phase of the film Miss Dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women's prison though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there. What we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. And as a result of all this violence Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer.But then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the women's prison reform business goes by the wayside. Dunne meets a judge Walter Huston who is married but he desperately wants her. Now throughout the film Dunne is portrayed as a very good girleven though she did have unmarried sex with Cabot she was more or less tricked into it. But now single Irene who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with his assurance off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business! BUT while she's pregnant with his love child he's indicted for being a crooked judge. He assures her he's innocent but he's convicted and it sure sounds like he's a scoundrelusing inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune. Then in the final moments of the film Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until Huston is released. The film then ends.So we basically have three separate films AND a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like. I gathered that she should be a strongminded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! This really undoes all the positives about Dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine anyone liking the film. A strong women's rights advocate might easily be offended at how weakminded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect! With a decent rewrite this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film but it couldn't make up its mind WHAT it wanted to be and was just another dull PreCode film.".

Miss Dunne plays a social worker who rises to play an important role in the penal system for females.IRENE DUNNE suffers nobly but it's a weak vehicle for a strong actress and she can do nothing to give the film a sense of real life struggles.

She too suffers in that she loses a toptier professional post and must makes ends meet by writing freelance newspaper articles. However she is undaunted and toughs it out until such time that Barney is paroled and reunited with her and their young son. It is so refreshing to see Dunne in this early role so far removed from both the screwball comedy and perfect wife and mother roles she would play in the middle and latter phases of her long career. We mourn with her the loss of her first child the death of whom is ambiguously depicted as coming about by abortion. We rejoice in her finding her soulmate Barney and cheer them for their unaffected love and affection and the joy they express over their impending parenthood. While this is a weepie the Queen of which she would become Dunne's performance is superior to that of her similar roles of this era.

By films end she has renounced careerism in favor of marriage to crusty convict Walter Huston no lessand what kind of lunacy would ever conceive of pairing these two romantically? Irene Dunne completists will no doubt wish to see this curiosity if only for the chance to hear her promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict under her charge I'm going to get you off the snow cold turkey !!! Well if nothing else such sordid goings on do present her light years from her usual milieu of operatic trills furbellowed chiffon and strawberry phosphatescocaine addiction not being the first subject one associates with the irreproachable Miss Dunne.";

NOTES Irene Dunne was superpopular worldwide though Ann Vickers was more successful in cities than the country and in carriage and middleclass suburbs rather than workingclass districts. COMMENT Ann Vickers is the sort of movie I really like. Here we have a fastmoving plot packed with incident a sympathetic lead and interesting support characters smart witty dialogue all abetted by stylishly inventive pacy direction and highly polished photography. Production values only fall down in a couple of minor matters like the obvious use of models for the Stuyvesant Building and the clumsy superimposition of Irene Dunne's closeup over the prison scenes. Maybe this latter device was designed to disguise the fact that these scenes were extracted from the stock footage library  but if so they were darn good. Two photographers were employed David Abel doing the bulk of the work like the lovely softfocus closeups the dynamicallyframed twoshots and the dramatic reverse angles of Miss Dunne whilst Eddie Cronjager contributed the more high contrast material such as the single take with Dunne and Oliver in the taxi. Dunne carries the bulk of the action. I think she is in every scene though of course she does take a back seat as a spectator in the trial sequences. Attractively photographed styled and dressed Miss Dunne brings Sinclair Lewis' plucky heroine to sympathetic life. Led by Walter Huston and Edna May Oliver the support cast is enlivened by a highly skilled array of players including Bruce Cabot in a small but meaty role Gertrude Michael making the most of her one brief scene Edwin Maxwell and especially Mitchell Lewis. It's easy to spot other favorites like Arthur Hoyt and Jane Darwell both Stuyvesant board members J. Carroll Naish a nonspeaking bit as a drunken doctor Irving Bacon also no dialogue as a waiter. Huston himself has only one brief scene in the first half of the film but comes into his own in the second half where he plays with his usual feisty vigor. Unfortunately Huston's selfconfident and selfpossessed sincerity is not echoed by Conrad Nagel who makes his part as Irene's social worker colleague a little too prissy though maybe this is true to Lewis' vision of the character. In any event his role is small. Also mercifully brief is Rafaella Ottiano's impersonation of Irene's secretary at the Stuyvesant Home. Luckily she doesn't come on until the latter half of the picture but she's a bit hard to take what with her constant facial grimacing that serves no purpose other than plain camerahogging. Max Steiner has obliged with a melodic music score the film editing is exceptionally adroit the movie is always attractive to look at and often scintillating to hear. Perhaps one or two dull sequences but all told a lively and engrossing 72 minutes. OTHER VIEWS Packed with incident the movie seamlessly crosses the boundaries of a number of genres The brutal prison scenes align with classic film noir the wronged woman with traditional weepies the final silverlined clouds with storybook romance.".

It is told with the sensibility of the 1930s and with an eye toward female audiences.Dunne is Ann Vickers a social reformer dedicated to her career and not interested in men or dating. Nevertheless due to her attractiveness men are interested. One is a soldier about to be shipped out during WW I Bruce Cabot with whom she enjoys a onenight stand and becomes pregnant. She has promised to marry him if he still wants her upon his return he really doesn't. She goes off with her friend Malvina Edna May Oliver to her country place. In one scene she talks about how much she wanted the baby girl and it was a shame that the baby died. So either she miscarried or had an abortion. We're left hanging. If she and Malvina were going out of the city I understood that it was so she could be pregnant and no one would know it.

And complications ensue.You can tell by the way I've related this story that this is not about a woman ahead of her time independent an early feminist although that is supposed to be what it is.Instead the story is skewed toward her love life and she marvels at how the Huston character has killed her ambition. As in so many other movies ambition and careers mean one thing  spinsterhood  and a happy ending can only be achieved if she forsakes her career for the man she loves.It sounds like I'm knocking this philosophy  I'm not. This was the attitude back then and in some places it's still the attitude. The Vickers character was unconventional sexually a feature of precode.

Her character doesn't allow herself to love at first perhaps for fear of being hurt.Huston as the judge with more than a few issues is always good and Edna May Oliver gives an earthy practical performance.All in all I did not think this was very good.

Gabin shouts whereas he's an impotent little boy under his mother's thumb.From the very beginningand what I write is not really a spoiler we know he's the killerSimenon did not write a whodunithe's more interested in his poor man's psychology whom his mother and his wife an excellent Annie Girardot will try to save stopping at nothing for that.The film begins slowly but when it hits its strideafter about thirty minutes it grabs you till the very end with more and more verbal violence.NoJean Delannoy is not the mediocre director the nouvelle vague used to despise.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jean Delannoy stands as one of the best if not simply the bestSimenon adapters.In the short space of two years he made two gems while the nouvelle vague was insulting him and these two gems should not be missedMaigret tend un pige and Maigret et l'affaire SaintFiacre 1959both absorbingboth featuring a topnotch castboth packing a real wallop.The first one is an urban psychological thrillerthe second one takes place in the countryin the castle of old aristocrats.Maigret tend un pige is at first sight a serial killer story but Simenon is too subtle a writer to be content with that.And I'm sure that Jean Delannoy had seen Julien Duvivier's sensational film noir voici le temps des assassins 1956not only he casts Jean Gabin as MaigretGabin who was the hero of Duvivier's moviebut he also uses Lucienne Bogaert who was his exwife in the same movie.Bogaert portrayed a drug addict abominable criminal in 1956in Delannoy's filmshe is an over possessive motherproud of his son who could have been a sculptora painteran artista geniushad they not thwarted his outstanding gifts.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS This son is a very complex character masterfully played by Jean Desaillywho probably found his lifetime part herehe's so intense that he will leave you illatease.He criesscreams begsalmost never stops twitchingand his tragic strength is absolutely incredible.Be a man!!! Gabin shouts whereas he's an impotent little boy under his mother's thumb.From the very beginningand what I write is not really a spoiler we know he's the killerSimenon did not write a whodunithe's more interested in his poor man's psychology whom his mother and his wife an excellent Annie Girardot will try to save stopping at nothing for that.The film begins slowly but when it hits its strideafter about thirty minutes it grabs you till the very end with more and more verbal violence.NoJean Delannoy is not the mediocre director the nouvelle vague used to despise.";

Nevertheless I try not to miss any of his films when they crop up on Italian or French Cable TV channels and for what it's worth I've always been on the lookout for at least two of his late 50s films  Claude AutantLara's LOVE IS MY PROFESSION 1958 with Brigitte Bardot and the film under review here.Anyway Gabin is perfectly cast as the worldweary Police Inspector who is pondering retirement when the reemergence of an old nemesis  a serialkiller who stabs lonely brunettes coming home late at night  taunts him back into action with a supremely clever plan to trap the killer hence the film's title. The film also features in a supporting role the actor who for all intents and purposes replaced Gabin in French filmgoers' minds as the brooding action hero Lino Ventura but it's Annie Girardot as a neglected but ultimately selfsacrificing wife and Jean Desailly as her impotent motherfixated artist husband who leave the best impression in the crowded supporting cast.Jean Gabin would go on to appear as Inspector Maigret in 2 subsequent films  MAIGRET ET L' AFFAIRE SAINTFIACRE 1959 which I've caught up with a couple of years ago and MAIGRET VOIS ROUGE 1963  and work a further 5 times with director Delannoy including the aforementioned second Maigret film interestingly enough Delannoy himself would abandon his own artistic aspirations shown earlier in two major French films of the 1940s  L'ETERNEL RETOUR 1943 and LA SYMPHONIE PASTORALE 1946  to concentrate on modest genre offerings of which MAIGRET SETS A TRAP is the bestknown and probably best overall as well for the rest of his career.Inspector Maigret is celebrated French pulp writer Georges Simenon's most famous literary creation and had previously been portrayed on the screen by Pierre Renoir in one of his brother Jean's most elusive films NIGHT AT THE CROSSROADS 1932 and also by the great Charles Laughton in Burgess Meredith's intriguing directorial outing THE MAN IN THE EIFFEL TOWER 1950  neither of which I've watched alas  and would go on to be impersonated by a variety of formidable character actors among them Rupert Davies Gino Cervi and Michael Gambon for TV!".

	schema:reviewBody "Jean Gabin plays Inspector Maigret here in a role that I find him quite matched to. I always figured him as fitting kindly roles after watching him play gangsters so often the French have had an ambivalent occasionally adulatory disposition towards gangsters judging from their domestic movie output which perhaps makes these roles for Gabin less of a clang for them  perhaps this is similar to our English views of Robin Hood and Dick Turpin!.I came to this movie via an interest in director Jean Delannoy. Even though it appears to be a very commercial project he's helming on behalf of a studio rather than a more obviously auteurdriven piece such as L'Eternel Retour there are perhaps significant parallels with his other work. Delannoy I believe was preoccupied with matters Oedipal definitely by family conflict of the dysfunctional variety and you can see this for example in La Symphonie Pastorale where a father and son both fall in love with the same woman also in L'Eternel Retour with the damaged Achille spoiled by his parents and in Macao enfer de jeu where Ying Tcha's entire life is concealed from the daughter he dotes on.Whilst Maigret Sets a Trap is about la chasse au tigre or a tiger hunt with the Marais killer being the tiger there's also a story of intergenerational abuse that's powerful and fascinating. I felt I learnt several lessons whilst watching the movie particularly about the power of jealousy to provoke extravagant paranoias under which lie quite delicate realities and how the truth is often more human than you think also about temperance Maigret makes a joke about being unable to obtain attractive partners and appearances. I'm fascinated about private versus public realities ever since seeing Paul Klee's beautiful series of Der Komiker The Comedian etchings as a teenager. These show men wearing masks that look like faces and you can see the real quite different faces behind. In this movie there's a huge divide between persona and the repressed and crippled personalities behind them.Today's audiences may find that Jean Desailly Marcel Maurin overacts but I think Delannoy is far cleverer than is often given credit for and provides his own commentary on the style of acting in the movie when Maigret is at pains to instruct a con on how to act to the press.I think I fell in love with this movie because I was never really sure where it was going and there's some dirty thoughts to be had if you get inside the paranoia. There's also not many movies where you have such a human detective who even conducts a late night interview with his undone belt surrounding a bulging belly. The ending is quite iconic in its own way and rounded off a charming watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this movie you understand why young French filmmakers of that time were desperate to develop a new movie language. It's a prime example of what they derisively called Cinema du Papa as in stuffy and dated. Indeed this movie might as well have been made in 1938 instead of 1958. It's setbound slowmoving and talky with stock characters and predictable plot twists. The atmosphere it evokes is hardly that of a bustling metropolis more a provincial backwater with outdated attitudes towards women and artists. It seems to aim at an audience who weren't at all interested in jazz or existentialism and who still saw Picasso as a thirdrate con artist. Women should take care of their husbands like Mrs. Maigret ready to supply him with his pipe and slippers and serve his soup. And real men should choose manly professions like butcher or they can turn out pathetic mummy's boys. Or worse.....Less critical viewers may enjoy this as a pleasant policier from a bygone age with a competent performance by the legendary Jean Gabin. Me for one am glad the New Wave of French filmmakers was already waiting in the wings to clear out the cobwebs.".

	onyx:emotionText "Watching this movie you understand why young French filmmakers of that time were desperate to develop a new movie language. It's a prime example of what they derisively called Cinema du Papa as in stuffy and dated. Indeed this movie might as well have been made in 1938 instead of 1958. It's setbound slowmoving and talky with stock characters and predictable plot twists.

Upon their arrival she begins to explore her new habitat meeting local children and learning their routines and customs. However it's not long before several bizarre occurrences crop up around the previously tranquil island. Orchards are found ransacked prized trinkets start disappearing and worst of all each morning after her mother leaves for work Momo hears strange mumblings coming from the attic of their home. Annoyed by these creepy goingson and her mother's refusal to believe them Momo embarks on a strange and supernatural adventure to discover the source of the mischief which leads her to a trio of troublesome imps the flatulent lizard Kawa the childlike Mame and their hulking ogre leader Iwa. Momo also learns that her visit to the island is in some way connected to her father's mysterious letter.";

	schema:reviewBody "A Letter to Momo had reportedly taken the director Okiura Hiroyuki 7 years to produce. Allow me to be the first to say the time and effort spent on perfecting this film have not gone to waste.The artanimation in this movie is topnotch. Production I.G. with assistance from P.A. Works Studio Pierrot and CG by Dandelion resulted in stunning visual quality down to the tiniest details. What I especially liked was the amount of attention paid to body language and gestures. There's so much information to be gleaned from subtleties of the visuals alone and that's what I find most interesting about Japanese films. There was also this action sequence near the end that just blew me away. I don't want to spoil but I have not seen such breathtaking handdrawn animation since watching Tonari no Totoro in the late '80s.The story begins with the protagonist Momo moving to a small fictional island named Shiojima with her mother. Their new house appears to be haunted and she feels absolutely miserable about moving out of Tokyo. Being a city girl that she is Momo struggles to adjust to the country life. Instead of playing with the local kids she eventually befriends three Youkai in her house  Iwa Kawa and Mame. Momo begins to appreciate the life on the island and come to realize the meaning of his late father's unfinished letter to her.The character development in this movie is absolutely phenomenal. It begins with a light comedy but through numerous adventures and mishaps on the island we slowly learn about her past. The transition from comedy to drama is seamless and it really makes you to care about the protagonist by the end... This film has what I call magic something Ghibli films of late desperately lack. Although the local kids were severely underused in this movie the three Youkai were the true supporting cast. Their chemistry with the protagonist was excellent and the humor just comes naturally. Mame's character was especially funny in a quirky way. One can easily tell how much thought and planning has been put into this film just by watching the impeccable timing at which Mame's character was used as comedic relief every single time.Every piece of music appears to be fully orchestrated especially the violins stood out to build tension in action scenes. Momo's voice acting by child actress and seiyuu Miyama Karen was a perfect fit as well as the three Youkai.A Letter to Momo is almost like a homage to Studio Ghibli's kids movies  My Neighbor Totoro Spirited Away and Ponyo. It sticks to the tried and tested formula of supernatural spirits that only interacts with kids and somewhat predictable plot development. However the producers have managed to merge various elements from all those films into an exciting original story. A Letter to Momo is a magical crowdpleaser with great pacing and a heartwarming story. It's a solid movie that anime and movie fans should not miss.".

	schema:headline " The Aftermath of the Great Earthquke";
	schema:reviewBody "The film is a story about a girl's spiritual growth and overcoming difficulties in a new life. Momo Miyaura a sullen 11yearold encounters three goblins from an old Edoera's comic book. The goblins are Iwa Kawa and Mame. Iwas is large clumsy and honest Kawa is middle manipulative and greedy Mame is small slow and infantile. They are mischievous sloppy and dull.Their appearances are reminiscent of Kyoka Hyakki Yakyo an illustration of goblins in an Edoera comic book called Kibyoshi. Kibyoshi is a precursor of 'manga.' In the Edo era various images of goblins entertained readers and told valuable lessons.The film is set in Shio Shima Inland Sea an allusion to Yasujiro Ozu's classical film Tokyo Story. Momo moves from Tokyo to the small island after her father's sudden death. While she is boarding a ship three drops of spirits come down from the sky and land on her. The drops are the goblins or guardians which help her reconcile a sad memory about her father. She regrets criticizing her father before he passed away.In the film the legendary goblins and Momo develop strange but warmhearted relationships that unite the past and present or this world and afterlife. A motif of connectedness appears at various levels and creates a poignant but cheerful story. First it shows continuation of time in Japanese popular culture by making a connection with the funny goblins emerging from a kibyoshi and in Momo's contemporary life. The past is linked to the present via 'manga.' The emergence of old 'manga'unfolds a history of Japanese popular culture which intertwines with her daily life and symbolizes continuity.Second the connectedness illustrates the relationships between the spirits and humans in a spectacular way. Various types of spirits such as orchard spirits ocean spirits and forest spirits assist Momo. This is most memorably exemplified when the spirits collaborate to help her in the midst of a fierce typhoon. Thanks to their support she overcomes a difficulty. Demonstrating collective forces the animating spirits generate a harmonious and splendid message that life is working with others. Nobody can live alone.In addition the scene also gives us a lesson. Each one of the vigorous spirits provides her with a tiny power that is almost negligible but its contribution is valuable and finally brings a tremendous result to aid her. It reminds us that selfishness and indifference do not bring anything good. The significant message is that everybody has a role to play in the world. The scene is a pivotal moment of her spiritual growth.Furthermore the connectedness with the spirits also underlines a powerful animistic note that we are part of nature which exerts enormous power and is larger than us. Nature and humans can coexist harmoniously in this world. The connectedness is the key that keeps our lives going.Third the connectedness demonstrates that death is not the end of life. The goblins have been sent from Above in order to watch over the living. Their special mission is to rally round Momo and report about her life to Above. Their mission expresses a vastness of time in human life including the afterlife. In short the dead also have a mission to do in this world. A person's life in this world is finite but one receives another mission to complete in the afterlife. The amicable relationships between the hilarious goblins and her imply that the deceased can also return to this world and work together with the living. The connection between the dead and the living indicates a culture of ancestor worship emphasizing the relationships between ancestors and offspring or the past and present.Accordingly the story offers a strong viewpoint that it is possible that we can be befriended by spirits or the deceased. A sense of infinite life is an unforgettably emotional moment and contributes to her psychological relief that she has another chance to make up with her father. Finally the togetherness ameliorates her hardship. All the connectedness is linked to a process of her reconciliation with her regret.This film would be particularly appealing for victims of the unprecedented great earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in 2011. Many people unexpectedly lost their loved ones and everyday lives. They were totally unprepared to suffer such tragedies let alone time to bid farewell. Later they left their familiar lands and have been struggling with new environments.In the film such sentiments are clearly illustrated. Momo's father had an accident at sea and never returned. Her relocation to Shio Shima is an outcome of the loss of her father. The abrupt loss echoes Japanese collective grief and sorrow for those affected by the unbearable incidents.Likewise Momo's struggle is part of their struggle. Her feeling of sadness is theirs her tears are theirs. Eventually her achievements foreshadow their hopefulness. The story captures her shuttered heart as a reflection of theirs. It epitomizes Japanese psychology  many people hesitate to talk about their tragedy because it is negative.The film finally offers a moment of catharsis and kindles a flame of hope. Consequently underlining the importance of familial bonds and hopes that keep them going toward their future A Letter to Momo is a letter to those victims.More importantly the story conveys Japanese Gambaro spirit that is an encouragement for people to work hard. The spiritual essence cultivates a sense of espritdecorps and persistence. Gambaro spirit is a sense of working hard together and for others who will help us sometime and somewhere.Ultimately intersecting beings from the afterlife with this world the film informs us of a traditional belief that invisible spirits live together in this world in order to help us.All the deceased are our guardians so chin up!".

	schema:reviewBody "After the death of her father 11yearold Momo and her mother move to a remote island to live with her grandparents. Her mom isn't much at home because she has to commute to work every day and the two generally are quite estranged since the father's passing. Furthermore Momo has a hard time making friends in the new environment until one day she hears strange noises in the attic which turn out to come from three peculiar creatures that only the girl can see. They seem pretty mischievous but are they looking to hurt or to help the girl? 'A Letter to Momo' is a delightful anime that admittedly is quite a bit like the great 'My Neighbor Totoro' but it feels nothing like an uninspired rehash in fact I liked this one even a bit better. As far as substance goes this is pretty slight but the story here is secondary to the gorgeous animation that feels very alive every moment is lovingly animated with brilliant attention to detail to movement and the smallest of gestures. It has a captivating consistent summertime atmosphere to which the rich sound work contributes almost as much as the animation.This very much starts out as a slice of life drama until the monsters come into play at which point the film becomes really funny. But even though the antics of the creatures are hilarious and those guys are pretty crazy the character of the girl is wellfleshed out and she remains wonderfully real. The third act is mostly a very dramatic tearjerker. If this sounds like the film is all over the place or the tone is inconsistent it is not. All the elements work together smoothly and it's a wellrounded experience. It is excellently paced but it does take its time and at two hours it might run a bit long. If you are a fan of slice of life anime with supernaturalmagical elements this definitely comes highly recommended. Also suitable for your small ones.".

	schema:reviewBody "Young Momo Miyaura voice of Karen Miyama and her mother Ikuko voice of Yuka leave Tokyo and move to a remote Japanese island following the accidental death of Momo's father. Aside from feeling outcast and out of place Momo also feels guilty because her last conversation with her father was an angry outburst he started to write a letter to her but after Dear Momo no other words were written on the page. Once in the small fishing village the children of the town especially Koichi voice of Takeo Ogawa and his little sister try to include Momo in their activities but she isn't ready to deal with other people yet. Her mother is off on training courses or in the orchards all day leaving Momo feeling even more alone. But then she starts to hear three voices in the house when she's apparently alone these turn out to be three former gods turned goblins including the Ogre with a huge rectangular mouth Iwa voice of Toshiyuki Nishida the froglike and flatulent Kawa voice of Koichi Tamadera and tiny childlike Mame voice of Cho. Unlike most humans Momo can see and interact with these beings and although they get off to a rocky start soon enough they find that they need and care for each other in more ways than one. How the goblins help Momo resolve her feelings about her father's death her mother's distance and her complete change of environment is all part of the charming and gentle A Letter to Momo. This lovely film was written and directed by Hiroyuki Okiura who devoted seven years to crafting this film using the skills of artists to create an almost entirely handdrawn 2hour animated film. The scenic landscapes are as usual in Japanese animation beautifully rendered and the characters are all lovingly drawn with great attention to detail. I'm not very familiar with Japanese mythology but the three goblins in particular the rectangularmouthed Iwa looked familiar to me suggesting that they might have more resonance with a Japanese audience than a North American one. Regardless of the depth of knowledge of the audience member almost everyone is sure to be entertained and touched at times by this lovely fable.".

I'm not very familiar with Japanese mythology but the three goblins in particular the rectangularmouthed Iwa looked familiar to me suggesting that they might have more resonance with a Japanese audience than a North American one. Regardless of the depth of knowledge of the audience member almost everyone is sure to be entertained and touched at times by this lovely fable.";

You only have to pause the film and look closely at that you are seeing to appreciate the detail. Even the rice cooker in the kitchen is an exact match for an actual rice cooker.The intent clearly was not to move into the more actionpacked stories space time travel wars but to stick with the tried and true tale of a young girl connecting with nature spirits of a sort that are again unique to the culture. Very similar to My Friend Totoro with more of an emotional stepladdering Personally I loved it Give it a chance and you may be crying by the end.That goes for the ladies too".

	schema:reviewBody "Almost like the movie spirited away. Except in this case it's not a girl who wanders with her parents into a Yokai domain but the Yokai busting into the human world. This was a good film about a girl who moved with her mother to Shio from Tokyo. Both have strained themselves to keep the memories of their Husbandfather alive so they can move on with their lives. But instead Momo lingers on with an unfinished letter from her father who wanted to apologize for going on an excursion on the night of a family date. Seeing as this clearly upset Momo she practically cursed her father out of spite and lost him in a horrible accident. Since the move however her grandmother introduces her to a small room called the sky Attic where memories are kept intact in forms of statues or books. With a curious eye Momo reads one in particular about a group of Yokai who watched over her family for generations. Seeing as this presented no problems she begins to hear and see the real thing which questions her sanity. Since nobody else can see them except for a smaller girl Momo decides to allow them to stay inside her house on the condition they stay in the sky room. But as will all Yokai they cannot keep still for one moment which then leads Momo on a remarkable trip of self discovery. This was a fresh approach to how kids dealing with pain in the most minute details. For Momo not being able to say goodbye properly to her father after his death gives her a new resolve. More so because on a particular night a typhoon ripped through Shio while Momo was exposed to the elements. Her mother of course who suffered from asthma starts to fall ill to her condition because she couldn't find her. Momo and her new friends struggle to help save her mother from certain death to go out into the typhoon and reach the hospital as soon as possible with the help of a neighbourly mail man. Soon all the Yokai help her to attain that clearance to let her reach her goal. And with their help saved her mother in time. The story was well done as well as the music. I found this film rather slow at first but when it picked up later the laughs tears started to roll like clock work. I think all ages will enjoy this film for its humour its back story lines as well as seeing the tragedies become less impactive to those who were closest to it. Momo struggled hard but with her Yokai friends life was more bearable to endure seeing as demons of ghosts know a lot more about death than humans. Memories are made and memories fade with Momo her memories of her father became clearer and with the help of her demon buddies got a message at last from her father who simply said..... Well you got to see the movie for that. Highly recommended to all.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this film begins it looks like another high quality film from Studio Ghibli Miyazaki's studio but it isn't it's from Bandai the folks who make many anime series television programs. I didn't realize that they also did fulllength filmsbut after seeing the quality of this movie I sure would like to see more from these folks.The film is about a girl named Momo Japanese for 'Peach'. She and her mother move out to the country from Tokyo after Momo's father's death. Momo hates living there and wants to be back in Tokyo. She also has trouble getting to know the local kids as she is rather shy. However over time three unexpected friends help her out during this time of needthree goblins who are scary looking but who are really quite nice. The problem is that she alone sees them and at first she's scared half to death and you cannot blame her! Eventually however the four make peace and the rest of the plot is just something you'll need to see for yourself.So is it any good? Well as I mentioned above the quality of the production is very nicereally nice animation lovely music and some cute characters. The story is also lovelya bit less strange than some of the Miyazaki films such as Spirited Away and it has a very strong Shinto message involving the dead father trying to contact his daughter from the great beyond. Some religious folks might object to this message but it is very sweet and very Japaneseso what do you expect from a cartoon from Japan?! Well worth seeing...and one that actually might be good to see with a box of Kleenex nearby.By the way the DVD I watched was the American version. Often things are changed or mistranslated in the process and I assume there are some difference between the original and this version. I don't think they would have called these creatures goblins in Japan perhaps spirits or demons. Regardless I just want you to know that my review is based on the Americanized version. Usually I prefer to see subtitled and original products not ones redone for local consumption but I oddly had problems getting the DVD to play the Japanese version which was on the same disc but just wouldn't work on my DVD player.".

Like most of the great Japanese animations that came out in other parts of the world in the recent decades it is well suited for people of any age mainly because of all the adult themes and motives presented in it.Here we find young and grieving Momo who after a tragic death of her father moves with her mother to a remote village of Shio in order to find inner peace. However this very quiet and mellow place is nothing what it seems. After a series of bizarre encounters Momo finds herself in a strange let's say friendship with the three adorable spirits that live in the village. In order to find out what are they really doing in Momo's life she has to believe in their good intentions which does not seem easy at all. With her mother's sudden illness she has to overcome her fears and start a great adventure not only to save her mother but also discover what her father meant to tell her before he passed away.The magical aura surrounding the whole movie is what makes this beautiful tale a true masterpiece. The characters of the spirits are simply admirable because of their comedic behavior. And the transformation of a very shy girl to a brave heroine is what gives the plot a strong kick.I have always been a fan of anime movies and TV shows but after a recent number of flops I have to say that A Letter to Momo gave me a new reason to believe in the greatness of animators from the Country of Cherry Blossoms.".

Momo's father has just died in a boating accident and an unfinished letter that opens only with 'Dear Momo...' doesn't bring about the kind of closure the young girl needs. Three drops of rain from the sky however accompany Momo to the island where they take the form of ghostly goblins from an old picturebook.Even though the creatures can only be seen by Momo the trick with anime films of this kind is that the viewer needs to be drawn into Momo's view of the world not seeing the line between fantasy and reality letting the message that lies behind it weave a magic spell without being overstated. That of course if the cinematic art of illusion and A Letter To Momo does this particularly well creating good interaction between the characters exploring the opportunities for visual effects and building it all up to towards an epic conclusion that gets message across sensitively without preaching or speaking down to a younger audience.".

Also the characters are just too plain simple...this was the same in Omohide Poro Poro but at that time it made sense with the setting as the main character in the latter a city girl was on temporary holiday in a village. It failed here as the main characters here were permanently relocated from Tokyo to a village but they did not behave as city folks from the start especially the daughter who should be more spoilt than portrayed and the process of blending in seemed too premature and quick.Character development is lacking and below my expectations.

	schema:reviewBody "The film starts with a passionate embrace between Tom and Viv on the innocent setting of an Oxford punt. For the next quarter of an hour you may think that this will be an ordinary merchant ivory type film about an uppercrust gal and her american beau writing away their cares in the dreaming spires of Oxford. However the idyllic setting and the gentle breezes soon fade into nothingness and before long you are forced to comprehend the tortured soul of one suffering from mental hysteria and the immediate effects of that on those who are subjected to the outbursts. Miranda Richardson's performance as the highly strung wife of one of our most famous poets takes this film to another level. Although the story is essentially a simple love story why it sits apart from the rest is purely down to the fact that Tom suffers Viv's  neuroses silently like the true English gentleman he has become. Devotees of T.S. Elliot may find that the film is superficial in its reference to his work and that the focus is centered on Viv. Yet at the end of the film I was left with a heightened awareness of what and who might have propelled him to write the way he did. This bittersweet film tugs at the heart strings just so.".

Having seen both the play and the film before we took another look recently when it was shown on cable. Brian Gilbert the director showed a sensitivity to the material. He had the advantage of using locales where the real Tom and Viv lived in England thus producing an immediacy and intimacy that serves the film well. Tom was a man that loved his adopted country. He was a man in awe of the culture and traditions. In fact he adopted them as they were his own. His entry into that world in which he wanted to belong came to him courtesy of Vivienne HaighWood an upper class young woman who had her share of physical problems that plays greatly in this story. Viv's problems exacerbated her marital problems with Tom and her family. Evidently her condition could have been helped if the doctors that treated her would have gone in another direction as it's pointed out toward the end of the film by a physician that clearly understood her malady.The film is worth a look because of the excellent Miranda Richardson's portrayal of Viv a woman she captures well for our benefit. This is one of the best appearances by Ms. Richardson on the screen. William Dafoe's Tom gives the impression of being a complicated man. Rosemary Harris is another joy in the film as Viv's mother Rose. Tim Dutton and Nickolas Grace have some good moments in the film.Tom and Viv will not disappoint because Brian Gilbert's fine direction.".

Dafoe has the solemn dignified presence the accent of period Englishness of a certain class and his American accent suppressed in the voice but mingled nearly perfectly to sound like Eliot. In addition Eliot's life especially during these turbulent chapters were smothered and to see Dafoe incarnate Eliot gives life to a man who was often an abstracted mind.

He never came to visit her in the sanitarium  not once nor did she hear from him. At least that's how the movie portrays him. What I wonder is how accurate it all is.

	schema:headline " A tragic tale of creative power love and societal conformity in the mid1900s.";
	schema:reviewBody "Tom and Viv is a powerful story centered on one woman's fight to be an individual in midnineteenth century British society. Miranda Richardson does an excellent job of portraying the emotional depth of an intelligent carefree woman forced into living a conventional traditional life while her doctors husband acclaimed American poet T.S. Eliot and family believe her to be suffering from mental illness. Richardson captures the rage quirkiness and strength of a woman trying to make a difference in the world when nearly everyone she meets tries to keep her in her place. William Dafoe as Tom brilliantly shows the effects of Viv's upstarts on a man seeking to maintain traditional societal values and blend into a conventional though artistic and intellectual world. While the movie does not delve too deeply into Eliot's poetry it centers on his life and the life of the woman he claimed to love perhaps making a statement on how life blends into art. Ultimately Tom and Viv is a tragic story about the inadequate health system offered to women in the 1930s and how societal conformity put a wrench in the love and marriage of two brilliant people. It enrages the feminist humanitarian and author in me and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a deep and compelling story of both a poet and a woman's fall.".

It is a bit long too not always be interesting and really a bit ordinary at times. But it is still well acted and it does have something to say about the position of women in society.

	schema:reviewBody "I love this film if only for the actors! Willem Dafoe has always been one of my favorites and his portrayal of T.S. Eliot is wonderful but Miranda Richardson's role as Vivienne HaighWood Eliot is phenomenal. At first you have sympathy for Eliot because you think he's married to a nut case though we're never really told what's wrong with Vivienne other than women's problems. However as the movie moves on and you listen to the occasional narration of Vivienne's brother Maurice you turn your sympathy towards Vivienne. Remembering Tom Eliot is an American it's tedious watching him turn into the perfect Englishman as he'd always wanted. I do love the period costumes cars and decor very beautiful scenery as well. It's a rather sad story of secrets denial and betrayal and in the end you feel left unsatisfied because once Vivienne is committed she never gets out. One must wonder if she didn't choose to stay by her own accord even after being seen by an American Dr. who questions her long stay at the asylum. Tom has apparently moved on and must not have had regrets because Vivienne tells her brother that I haven't' heard from Tom in ten years. It is at this point Maurice realizes what a terrible mistake he's made and is deeply ashamed of his decision to go along with Tom in having his own sister committed a woman who was obviously very intelligent. Vivienne is quite an interesting character that leaves you wondering what she'll do next whereas Tom is most predictable. I do recommend this film.".

Inevitably this means the Bloomsbury Group though the film is modest in its examination of those personalities themselves using Ottoline Morrell Virginia Woolf and Edith Sitwell et al as a backdrop  foil for the highly strung Vivienne Eliot rather than out andout antagonists.It is Vivienne about whom this film rotates. She appears to be the life force that drives Tom Eliot on in his decisions and actions if only through her spasmodic mood swings. It's a very difficult role for Miranda Richardson who is excellent perfectly cast to grade we need a sense of escalation but also to see that her postmenopausal self is significantly different from how she was before Tom. The result is a rich portrayal dizzying and distracting from the couple's real dynamic. As a narrative I'm sure it's accurate. As drama it's less satisfying.Willem Dafoe is a nicely taciturn Eliot with the same strong features as the poet if not an obvious lookalike. The attention to design detail especially in costume is quite excellent. Recommended as a broadbrush primer for this important period in TS Eliot's professional development. 610".

It was like he was making a statement to the world.He was no Emily Dickinson he got acclaim for his poetry during his life but I'm sure back in 1915 when this story starts Eliot didn't want fame or sought it. He wanted to teach to write and toward that end he found both his muse and love of his life.And that's the person that Willem Dafoe is showing us when Tom  Viv starts. He's an eager young scholar of no particular repute who is in love with Miranda Richardson as Vivienne HaighWood. Father Philip Locke figures he's a fortune hunter brother Tim Dutton likes him and they become close and mother Rosemary Harris is grateful that someone is taking her off their hands.But they don't tell young Eliot about Vivienne's mental problems which grow more pronounced with age. Richardson earns Dafoe's love inspires his poetry and tries his patience beyond measure. In the end she's put away in an asylum.The real kicker though is a scene with an American doctor during the closing part of World War II when it is discovered that her problems could now have been treated medically. The doctors had it all wrong with her but only recent advances in science have shown the error of their ways. By that time it's way too late for either Tom or Viv.Tom  Viv got two Oscar nominations for Miranda Richardson for Best Actress and Rosemary Harris for Best Supporting Actress. Richardson is really fascinating to watch a woman in the grip of something she cannot comprehend but neither can anyone else. She lost to Jessica Lange for Blue Sky. As for Harris her final scene with Dafoe is what probably got her the nomination. She succeeds on so many levels understanding her daughter understanding why the marriage went bad but still hurt at Dafoe's betrayal of her daughter. Harris lost to Dianne Wiest for Bullets Over Broadway.Tom  Viv succeeds well in capturing the Great Britain of the two World Wars and the period between. The characters are sharply drawn and quite unforgettable in their way. Especially Richardson this may wind up as her career role as an actress.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another biography of a literature world's luminary from UK director Brian Gilbert WILDE 1997 TOM  VIV is about the perturbed marriage between American poet T.S. Eliot Dafoe and his first wife Vivienne HaighWood Richardson which lasts for 17 years from 1915 to 1932 separated but never divorced.It is a refined British period drama in quaint but steadfast pace a flamboyant Viv attracts the young poet the passion speeds them up to elope but Maurice Dutton Viv's younger brother implicitly hints to Tom there is something wrong with Viv a physical ailment or something like that but it is rather too embarrassed to say it loud.

Eliot Dafoe and his first wife Vivienne HaighWood Richardson which lasts for 17 years from 1915 to 1932 separated but never divorced.It is a refined British period drama in quaint but steadfast pace a flamboyant Viv attracts the young poet the passion speeds them up to elope but Maurice Dutton Viv's younger brother implicitly hints to Tom there is something wrong with Viv a physical ailment or something like that but it is rather too embarrassed to say it loud.

	schema:reviewBody "I write this for people who've seen the movie and don't understand it. First of all you have to understand that Sarah suffered from multipersonality disorder from a long time before the movie started most likely since she was a child. She didn't know this herself because it's like that with MPD's. The regular personality doesn't know what the others are doing. They are simply unaware. And her other personality hated men while her regular just didn't trust them. That's why she thought her old boyfriend Benny left without a note or anything. Her other personality reacted aggressively against a man that her regular personality loved it killed him and made it seem to her and her close friends that he just left suddenly. She didn't know he was dead. However although her other personality usually hates men it falls in love with Tony as well as Sarah herself. This is obvious in the scene where Sarah appears in Tony's home slaps him and has sex with him. Her regular personality wasn't ready for that kind of commitment yet also her other personality's way of having sex is very aggressive. Everything weird bizarre or directly threatening that happens towards Sarah is caused by her other personality because it's jealous. It wants Tony for itself. It starts out threatening herthe paper the flowers and ends with trying to kill herwith the heater in the bathtub. Sarah who doesn't know that it's her other personality and isn't good at trusting men especially men who are close to her blames Tony because she doesn't feel safe when he's around. However at the end she is told the truth by Tony He is investigating her in order to find out what happened to Benny. In the beginning Sarah doesn't believe that she's been stalking herself. However when her father enters he triggers some memories that awakes her other personality. She reacts aggressively to both because she feels as usual that men are the root of all evil. She starts by killing Tony because she was in fact in love with him and it seemsto her at least like he isn't in love with her. After killing him her father not knowing she is not herself at the moment tries to calm her down this triggers more unwanted memories she feels like she's back at the top of those stairs her father making her cover his crime. She reacts very aggressively as that memory is one part of the origin of her hate against menthe other being sexual abuse by her father. After killing him she destroys the tape which is the only devastating proof toward her suffering from multipersonality disorder. At that point she's still not herself but her other personality. She then covers her own crime as she feels that it was her father's fault just like back when she was little. After covering up her crime she sits down by the body of Tony and her other personality subsides. Sarah is herself again thereby she doesn't know what happened but guessthinks that Tony killed her fatherwhich would seem logical to her as she was certain that Tony was insane and she shot him in selfdefense. We hear that the police aren't going to file charges since it seems like an obvious case of selfdefense. She then gives us a definition on a multipersonality disorderwhich fits perfectly on herself and goes out with Cliff. She doesn't know that she is guilty of killing two people close to her and the movie ends with the disturbing conclusion that unless something hinders her from killing more her other personality can keep killing men while her regular personality can have a clean consciousness as she doesn't know the truth.ReviewWhile watching this movie I thought that it was just the regular thriller. I was very surprised at the ending which tries to turn it into more... I'm not quite sure it succeeds but it made everything that preceded it easier to forgive. The movie has a very Hitchcock feel to it suspense shocks atmosphere... It felt like it could have been the work of the late Hitchcock himselfsave for the sex scene which I'm not quite sure was so much necessary as an easy device to attract those on the lookout for such a thing. I recommend this to fans of thrillersjust don't expect a masterpiece... but hey it's got Rebecca De Mornay does anyone actually see her name on the cast list of anything and think oh quality cinema lies ahead!? particularly those who like them with a twist. Yes I actually just made that pun. 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "A more or less typical thriller made special by Rebecca De Mornay's awesome performance. She is the executive producer of this picture and must have badly wanted to do this role  I'm glad she did.She plays a psychiatrist evaluating whether an accused serial killer is competent to stand trial. It becomes obvious early on that she was drawn to psychiatry because of her own severe emotional problems and difficult past. In the meantime we are shown troubling relationships with men appearing in her personal life. An upstairs neighbor badly wants her but she wants only to be friends. Her father shows up out of the blue seeking affection and assistance but she resists him and it is obvious that their relationship and her childhood were deeply troubled. A stranger Banderas she meets in a store ardently pursues her and they begin an affair but she has difficulty trusting him both because he is something of a suspicious character and because as she tells him she has difficulty trusting anybody. Their relationship becomes volatile and angry tinged with violent overtones. Then there is the issue of her exfianc who vanished abruptly and without explanation just before the scheduled wedding.As happens in these kinds of films she is sent a series of mysterious messages and packages with no return addresses. Then violent things start to occur. Someone is clearly trying to terrorize her but who? So many suspects  Banderas? The upstairs neighbor who is of course jealous of Banderas? The serial killer acting through friends outside of prison? Her father? The exfiance? I did not anticipate the answer to this question revealed of course at the film's end but it was not an especially unusual conclusion for films of this kind. What made this picture worthwhile was De Mornay's utterly believable portrayal of let us say a difficult character reminiscent of what she did in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle. She is simply great at this kind of thing besides being classically gorgeous.The other acting is fine but no one stands out. Banderas is always good but in this one he is mostly eye candy for the ladies. Harry Dean Stanton as the serial killer is suitably menacing and crazed but this picture is really all De Mornay. I found it a bit slow at times but the last 20 minutes or so made up for the weak spots. Definitely worth watching.".

I daresay I'm older and have seen more classic thrillers than most of the imdb audience but this movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  And Banderas has never looked better.  I thought both lead characters were interesting and deep.  Harry Dean Stanton is marvelous as usual as the serial killer against whom De Mornay has to testify and Len Cariou does a nice turn as her estranged father trying to make final peace with her. De Mornay actually produced this and the daring sex scene could not have happened without her enthusiasm.  Okay I agree the dead cat was too much of a cliche but the detective?  Banderas' true identity?  Miller's real character?  The twists and turns certainly had me going.  Although I wanted to off De Mornay myself to take her place in the chainwire fence scene. And yes this old gal certainly found it erotic despite what I have read above.  I think this is her best performance todate.I give this 1010.".

De Mornay actually produced this and the daring sex scene could not have happened without her enthusiasm.  Okay I agree the dead cat was too much of a cliche but the detective?  Banderas' true identity?  Miller's real character?  The twists and turns certainly had me going.  Although I wanted to off De Mornay myself to take her place in the chainwire fence scene. And yes this old gal certainly found it erotic despite what I have read above.  I think this is her best performance todate.I give this 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "Though overlooked at the time of it's release Never Talk to Strangers is a wellcrafted thriller centering on the human dilemma of whether or not to trust others. Rebecca De Mornay stars as Dr Sarah Taylor a psychologist in an unnamed city who has a difficult personal life. She meets the charming Tony Ramirez Antonio Banderas in a supermarket and despite her many fears is soon drawn into a passionate relationship with him. Soon after meeting Tony Sarah acquires a stalker who sends her dead flowers and dismembers her pet cat. The audience is provided with a decent list of possible suspects including Tony Sarah's missing exboyfriend Benny or possibly her slightly sleazy upstairs neighbor a surprisingly good Dennis Miller. Other possibilities include her alcoholic father and associates of serial killer Max Cheski the wonderful Harry Dean Stanton on whom she is performing a courtordered psychiatric evaluation.As the plot unfolds it appears as if De Mornay's character has nowhere to hide and nobody she can really trust. Various characters appear more or less likely to be guilty of terrorizing her. The film also very deftly portrays Sarah's need for a relationship with Tony even though she is terrified that he is hiding something from her. The acting is top notch and the plot is full of satisfying twists and turns. If you are in the mood for a strong solid thriller then this ought to be a top choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Thriller was received poorly on it's release this is unfortunate as I found much to like here.Firstly I liked the main musical score running throughout the film and the Director was quite clearly going for a Hitchcockian feel which only partially succeeds though. The chemistry between the leads is excellent and the scenes containing both DeMornay and Banderas are the strongest and most watchable. I have to say I did not think Harry Dean Stanton put too much effort into his part as he was not all that convincing and Dennis Miller was just plain irritating. Len Cariou was okay as DeMornay's father but really the two leads are the main focus and the main reason to watch this. The love scenes although a bit lengthy were stylishly made and did not detract from the film the ending although a bit of a stretch was at least surprising and acted fairly convincingly although I am no shrink.So although being far from a classic I certainly thought it was far from being the worst thriller. I would rate it above the Meg Ryan effort In The Cut  Ashley Judd's Twisted along with Sandra Bullock's Murder by Numbers to name a few. My rating 6.6 out of 10".

Still this is a mystery and will offer a surprise for many during the last 15 minutes. I've always enjoyed Rebecca DeMornay. She has fascinating looks and is also a capable actress. I enjoyed seeing her in this movie. The median IMDb vote of 5 is about right.SPOILERS  READ NO FURTHER if you have not seen this movie.  Rebecca plays a psychiatrist and we see several scenes where she is evaluating an accused murdered for competency he claims to have multiple personalities but we suspect he is just trying to get off easy. Meanwhile she meets a handsome stranger Banderas who is actually investigating her to find out why her former boyfriend disappeared suddenly. Plus Dennis Miller plays her slightly askew friend who is always trying to get her to sleep with him. She gets a gift of dead flowers she reads her own obit in the newspaper she gets a box with her dead cat in it. In the climax turns out SHE has the multiple personality triggered by childhood experiences of molestation by her father she was stalking her own self presumably she got rid of her old boyfriend and in her apartment shot and killed both Banderas and her dad then giving a statement that she shot Banderas only after he had killed her dad.".

Rebecca De Mornay was good as the heroine and Antonio Banderas was even better as the romantic stranger. Len Cariou plays her father in a wasted role. Banderas is often better than the material and does not seem to take himself seriously as witnessed by the number of crummy movies he has appeared in.Never Talk To Strangers is an absorbing if uneven murder mystery which has been given short shrift by reviewers on the IMDb website.

Sure they had decent chemistry together but for what? The movie's premise was bad to begin with and the execution just made it even worst.Miss DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense hinge on multiple personality disorder. That pretty much will give you a hint to where the movie is going and the identity of the killer. Early in the movie she gets an unexpected visit from her father. This being made in the 1990's when the bad daddy was the in thing in Hollywood is another clue to the ultimate conclusion.Mr. Banderas plays a mystery man named Tony Ramirez who comes into Sarah's life. The whole first meeting and first encounter between Tony and Sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing it makes you wonder how it even got shot. And there's a sequence where the two of them are supposed to be knowing each other that is so sappy it doesn't seem to belong here. One thing that I would admit was that there was a sex scene that's very hot. Anyway creepy things start to happen after he arrives weird packages arriving things falling off the wall that could kill Sarah incident that say things aren't normal anymore. Overall the movie was badly conceived the editing at times seem jumpy and the conclusion was laughable. Another thing that bugged me about this movie was the whole Orchestral music playing in the background. A more subtle musical score would have been better. I have to say this no matter how bad the ending was Miss DeMornay was very good in that sequence. It's sad that she never got first rate materials in her career. She's that rare combination of talent and beauty.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is surprisingly not horrible. A product of the mid1990s Rebecca De Mornay boomlet it takes the womaninperil formula and jiggers with it just enough to come up with something worth watchingand not just for De Mornay's bosom.Sarah Taylor Rebecca De Mornay is a psychologist who starts receiving threatening letters and packages like someone is stalking her. But is her stalker Tony Ramirez Antonio Banderas the Puerto Rican charmer she's just fallen in love with? I s it Cliff Raddison Dennis Miller her upstairs neighbor who had a onenight stand with Sarah long ago and seems desperate for another encounter? Is it Max Chelski Harry Dean Stanton the serial killer she's analyzing in prison for his upcoming trial? Could it be her father Henry Len Cariou who's just reentered her life and with whom Sarah has an obviously disturbing relationship? Or does her stalker have something to do with the fiance who abandoned Sarah almost a year ago? The story keeps you wondering until revealing the truth which turns out to be pretty decent for a twist ending.Clocking in at under 90 minutes Never Talk to Strangers is like a well made wading pool. There's no depth to it but it works as it's intended to. There's some sex some mystery a little humor from Dennis Miller and just a touch of violence. There's not a lot of chemistry between De Mornay and Antonio Banderas. However they're both very pretty and the movie moves quickly enough that it never asks you to take their relationship too seriously. De Mornay Banderas and the rest of the cast do reasonably good acting jobs and the film is adequately written and directed. Despite the ambition of the twist ending there's not a lot here that will stick with you. For less than 90 minutes though it's a pleasant diversion.The only thing that separates Never Talk To Strangers from the typical womaninperil movie you'd see on the Lifetime channel are a few Fwords Banderas' bare butt and De Mornay's naked breasts. So if you're looking for a good racier version of that sort of thingyou'll find it here.The only truly interesting things about this film are the fact that De Mornay was one of the producers demonstrating again the principle of Producer SelfNudity and that it's a product of the aforementioned De Mornay boomlet. It's one of the more intriguing Hollywood phenomena where an actress who may have had some success as a starlet but never became a star suddenly experiences a career resurgence in her 30s. These women usually get one attentiongrabbing role and it's like the movie industry notices them again and decides to see if they can squeeze any more juice out of them. Sometimes these boomlets reinvigorate a career like they did with Sharon Stone. Sometimes it just peters out like it did with De Mornay. But whatever the reason for them the 30something boomlet is probably the one thing that keeps a lot of actresses plugging away in movies long after they should have found other employment. I'm pretty sure the beautiful and talented Winona Ryder is wondering when her boomlet is going to come along.".

	schema:reviewBody "Man is this lousy. It doesn't deserve much in the way of comment so keeping it brief Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls for Latin Lover Antonio Banderas in a wine store he of the ponytail and jailhouse tats. When she cuts loose she really cuts loose. Other than this torrid affair she's having and we must admit the affair has its speed bumps she's a pretty cold fish. Her broke ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out. She's also adept at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor Dennis Miller at bay. And there's prisoner Harry Dean Stanton who's trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so he won't have his privates nailed to the wall for the serial murders he's committed.All these people and perhaps more are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her. Somebody sends her dead flowers. Somebody does unspeakable things to her pet cat. The next time I see a household pet turn up in a parcel or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot I'm going to puke. So who's doing it? Guess. No power on earth could force me to reveal the ending but maybe a hint will help childhood abuse.The abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself far more interesting than the movie. What does childhood abuse mean? Do we mean sexual abuse? Physical? Both? How about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon hard enough to break it? That's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? That never happened to any of us as far as I know although I'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation. In the Samoan village I studied for two years there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family beat hell out of him. The boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village an exile that lasted two years. By the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone including the child. By the way the little girl we see here is under five so it's unlikely that she'd remember Dad's nighttime visits in any case since longterm memory isn't really established until about that time. DeMornay's experience leading to her mental disorder can be called the social construction of trauma. It's not there unless we put it there. Enough of the psychiatric lecture. That will be fifteen cents.You want trauma? I'll give you trauma. The film absolutely forces us to identify with Rebecca DeMornay's character right from the beginning. Then when she has her first tryst with Antonio Banderas and Pio Donnagio's score is pounding the eroticism into our heads the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the baretorsoed Antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest. Now THAT'S traumatic. It makes any male viewer feel as if he's on the floor of the laundry room at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. Don't get me wrong. I don't dislike Antonio Banderas. It's just that I'm not in love with him. There aren't enough nude shots of Rebecca DeMornay's elfin body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety.Here's an engaging way of surviving this movie.

	onyx:emotionText "Man is this lousy. It doesn't deserve much in the way of comment so keeping it brief Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls for Latin Lover Antonio Banderas in a wine store he of the ponytail and jailhouse tats. When she cuts loose she really cuts loose. Other than this torrid affair she's having and we must admit the affair has its speed bumps she's a pretty cold fish. Her broke ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out. She's also adept at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor Dennis Miller at bay. And there's prisoner Harry Dean Stanton who's trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so he won't have his privates nailed to the wall for the serial murders he's committed.All these people and perhaps more are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her. Somebody sends her dead flowers. Somebody does unspeakable things to her pet cat. The next time I see a household pet turn up in a parcel or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot I'm going to puke. So who's doing it? Guess. No power on earth could force me to reveal the ending but maybe a hint will help childhood abuse.The abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself far more interesting than the movie. What does childhood abuse mean? Do we mean sexual abuse? Physical? Both? How about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon hard enough to break it? That's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? That never happened to any of us as far as I know although I'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation. In the Samoan village I studied for two years there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family beat hell out of him. The boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village an exile that lasted two years. By the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone including the child. By the way the little girl we see here is under five so it's unlikely that she'd remember Dad's nighttime visits in any case since longterm memory isn't really established until about that time. DeMornay's experience leading to her mental disorder can be called the social construction of trauma. It's not there unless we put it there. Enough of the psychiatric lecture. That will be fifteen cents.You want trauma? I'll give you trauma. The film absolutely forces us to identify with Rebecca DeMornay's character right from the beginning. Then when she has her first tryst with Antonio Banderas and Pio Donnagio's score is pounding the eroticism into our heads the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the baretorsoed Antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest. Now THAT'S traumatic. It makes any male viewer feel as if he's on the floor of the laundry room at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. Don't get me wrong. I don't dislike Antonio Banderas. It's just that I'm not in love with him. There aren't enough nude shots of Rebecca DeMornay's elfin body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety.Here's an engaging way of surviving this movie. Instead of just sitting there puling try picking out the scenes that were filmed in Toronto and separating them from the ones shot in Budapest. It's a challenge really and may for all we know preserve your sanity.";

Even so it was a decent film until the very end when my rating went from a 5 to a 2.I was willing to accept the private detective who gave unrealistically timely and incredibly incorrect updates. What I won't accept is that the police don't follow even the most basic of crime scene procedures after the shooting. The most inept coroner would notice that Tony had not fired any gun and a cursory swab analysis of Sarah's hands would show that she had two different powders on them. I am not comparing this to the unrealistic standards of an episode of CSI Bones or Criminal Minds where the world's supposedly best forensic minds have access to the world's best and sometimes futuristic crime scene forensic technologies. Even overworked NY City cops would have done swabs in what might seem an open and shut case. Maybe especially in this case as cops tend to be suspicious by nature...".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been trying to think of a word to describe the main characters in this movie and the best one is incongruity. A macholooking Puerto Rican named Tony Antonio Banderas dressed in a leather jacket with big silver rings on most of his fingers turns out to be a wine expert and an excop with a great sense of fun and takes his sex either kinky or romantic. An upscale psychiatrist named Sarah Rebecca DeMoray is evaluating a murderer Max Cheski Harry Dean Stanton for Multiple Personality Disorder while she goes through extreme moods shifts. She falls for Tony who doesn't seem to be her type yet ends up being the perfect guy to help her with her sexual repression and problems with trust.This movie doesn't quite work as a thriller. It's poorly written and directed. Too many thriller clichs like the overuse of camera shots quick cuts and blaring screeching music at shocking moments. There are a number of stalker suspects  is it Tony? Neighbor Cliff? Dad Henry? Cheski? Yet I never believed any of them to be credible suspects. At no point was I ever on the edge of my seat worried about her being with any of these socalled suspects.The clues at least are nicely woven in. Although it makes a sartorial and editorial error when it gives us a clue about the real stalker  the film unwittingly rules out one of the suspects yet keeps on trying to make us believe he's one of them. I had a sense of who it was by the end. Although I found things about it distasteful and not well presented. I was surprised a couple of things so I didn't guess the entire ending beforehand.I found DeMoray's acting go from passable to over the top at times. The only one who actually makes this movie watchable is Banderas who manages to do some good things with the poor material he's given. When the film wants to be an erotic thriller he's the one not surprisingly who gives it the eroticism it wants not DeMoray. Not that they lack chemistry but she's not as up to the job as he is. When the film wants light fun romantic moments he's the one brings them to the film. When the film wants serious dramatic tension Banderas serves it up. Sometimes DeMoray either seems to lag behind him or goes over the top in an effort to match him.In spite of it's flaws as a thriller once you know what's really going on and watch it again it makes for a decent drama as long as you ignore the annoying overdone shocking moments. Second time through lets you actually understand the whys about things. Unfortunately most people aren't going to want to watch this thing a second time.".
