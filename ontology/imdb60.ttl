That's not saying a whole lot since this was a vehicle created for the two stars and only the two stars in this film could have brought it off.It was a happy marriage of convenience with John Wayne's character of Rooster Cogburn from True Grit being so popular that a sequel was inevitable given Wayne's health holding up and Katharine Hepburn looking for something she could costar with Wayne.Hepburn was one of John Wayne's biggest boosters of his talent politics aside. I remember reading that she thought John Wayne projected the same sense of integrity that Spencer Tracy did on the screen. Coming from her I've got to believe that's the best compliment she could offer.Wayne as Cogburn is on the trail of a gang that massacred an army patrol and stole a gatling gun and nitroglycerin for use in a planned bank robbery. The gang headed by Richard Jordan with Anthony Zerbe who used to scout for Wayne go to an Indian settlement with a missionary school headed by father and daughter preacher and teacher Jon Lormer and Katharine Hepburn. The gang shoots up the place and kills Lormer.When Wayne comes he gets a lot more than he bargained for when he finds himself saddled with Hepburn and young Indian boy Richard Romancito. They accompany him on the trail of Jordan and his gang and get enough adventure to last a lifetime.Everyone compares Hepburn as Eula Goodnight to her portrayal of another missionary Rose Sayer in The African Queen. Both are on a chase in The African Queen with Bogey after the Germans who destroyed the mission in East Africa and killed her brother and with Wayne after some outlaws. And both films feature a very fine sequence of the two stars riding some rapids. But I think Eula Goodnight is a far more experienced woman of the world than Rose Sayer. Both disapprove of the alcoholic behavior of their male counterparts. Rose however takes some direct action.As the film was designed around the two stars they settle comfortably in their roles. The chemistry between them is infectious that they liked each other would be obvious to an alien from another planet.I really envy young Richard Romancito to be in all those scenes and be able to watch a pair of screen legends.".

The scene between him and Katharine Hepburn at Fort Ruby was awesome you could see the sparks flying. Then there was the scene where the wheel broke off the wagon and Hawk gets furious with his men Jordan did a great job with that part talk about angry if looks could kill his would it gave me shivers.  Anthony Zerbe also does a great job as Breed.  The two of them Jordan and Zerbe are great together.  Like one scene in the saloon when Hawk learns about the wagon being taken by Rooster he starts to go out when Breed tells him that he will never take Rooster and that he had worked with him for three years you can see the daggers between the two. They are definitely two of the best character actors ever.  They don't make movies like this anymore where it was up to the actors to make a film a success and not rely on special affects.  And these four actors did this brilliantly.  I wish John Wayne and Richard Jordan were still around today.".

He won his only Oscar for it of course but he hadn't yet completely found ol' Rooster's voice.In this sequel co starring Katharine Hepburn the Duke has every aspect of Rooster down pat. The scenes he and Hepburn share trading their philosophies and anecdotes while they come to know and admire and platonically fall in love with each other is the engine of this film. Forget the plot it's passable enough but very much secondary this story gets along strictly on the strength of the two lead characters and it's worth seeing again and again just to watch these two Hollywood legends banter and spar in their one and only movie together.This was the first John Wayne film I ever saw in a movie theatre I was 9 years old in 1975 and it made me a lifelong fan. This is easily one of his most entertaining adventures. Hepburn and Wayne together is even more fun than Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen. A timeless treasure.".

And it worked. If anything Wayne with an unerring ear for the comic potential of his character is even better than he was in True Grit. It's a genuinely funny performance. Hepburn's character is too much an amalgam of Rose Sayer and Mattie Ross she could be True Grit's Mattie 50 years on. But the chemistry between her and Wayne is palpable they spark off each other.The plot isn't up to much. It's been cobbled together from scraps of better movies and there is a terrible bit of overacting from Richard Jordan as the chief villain but it looks great the scenery is terrific and is very enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is more than just a lot of fun to watch. John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn are wonderful but only because they are together. The chemistry between them is electrifying. Richard Jordan plays his villan role to a T. He is mean and nasty and he keeps his character believeable to the end. There is a scene between him and Katharine Hepburn at Fort Ruby that is absolutely brilliant you could feel the lightning flashing between their characters.  Think about the scene where the wheel broke off the wagon Hawk gets furious with his men and Jordan's character did a great job with his part he seem really angry as if looks could kill. His expressions well it gave me the willies. Don't you agree that Anthony Zerbe created a believeable Breed. The two of them Jordan and Zerbe are so believeable together. Remember the scene in the saloon when Hawk learns about the wagon being taken by Rooster? He starts to go out and Breed tells him that he worked with Rooster for three years...and that he knows that Breed will never take Rooster?  There is some great chemistry in that scene! They have tried to make movies like this before but it hasn't happened yet movies that made the actors create a film a success that was not relying on special affects alone but just the characters and the story.".

John Wayne reprises the title role with just as much gusto despite noticeably looking older. Katharine Hepburn also puts in a strong turn as the missionary with the best scenes being the banter between the pair. The villains are not particularly interesting and the plot is no great shakes in fact 'Rooster Cogburn' feels more like a remake rather than sequel to 'True Grit' at times with Hepburn also seeking vengeance for a father killed. The plot is more complex than it first seems though. While most are quick to praise the chemistry between Wayne and Hepburn it is the bond that slowly develops between Wayne and the young Amerindian played by Richard Romancito that is ultimately most touching. Romancito becomes a surrogate son of sorts to the once hardened old man who inadvertently finds himself with a 'family' for the first time as he pursues the gang. One wonders though just what messages if any the filmmakers had in mind with the project. Early on Wayne is told the west is changing and you aren't changing with it and yet minutes later he hired because again he has grit. Is the film meant to be a tribute to the virtues of old ways or a film about learning to change unwillingly accepting companions? Topped off with a memorable explosive climax one thing for sure is that this is a more dynamic sequel than one might expect.".

While in pursuit of the outlaws a warm rapport develops between the roughandtumble lawman and the flinty reverend's daughter according to the film's promotional description.While not promoted as such this also seems to be a sideways followup to The African Queen 1951 which starred Ms. Hepburn. Realized by veteran producer Hal B. Wallis and wife Martha Hyer the idea to bring the two legendary film stars together was a terrific one. But the result stopped at stunt casting. Probably done when considering their age and potential for fireworks everything seems to have been arranged to make it an easy assignment for the old pros. As a result you have John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn going through the motions and no fireworks. Rooster Cogburn 101775 Stuart Millar  John Wayne Katharine Hepburn Richard Jordan Anthony Zerbe".

	schema:reviewBody "Now that the two stellar costars are long gone the truth can be toldRooster Cogburn is turkey a formulaic film designed by the marketing department written by a writer paid by the word directed by a producer who was faking it. Some posters praise the chemistry between Wayne and Hepburn. What chemistry? They seem to be reading their lines off a Teleprompter and in a great hurry. This trivia tidbit tells it all Director Stuart Millar insisted on so many takes that eventually John Wayne snapped God damn it Stuart there's only so many times we can say these awful lines before they stop making any sense at all. A better director might have been able to get truer performances out of these great stars but Millar a fine producer but apparently a talentless director got little more than worn pennies. A good director would have told them to slow down breathe react and interact. Or just let these stars alone. There's not much of a plot and the writer doesn't do much of setting up the relationship Hepburn just suddenly decides to tag along with Wayne after the promised posse just happens to not show up and Wayne puts up very little argument against what should have been absolutely against his code. So the setup has little credibility to begin with. The comparison with African Queen is obvious too obvious complete with a ride down the rapids. It sets Rooster Cogburn a very high standard to live up to and it falls flat. It looks like some movie execs figured it was a can'tfail formula. In African Queen there was some tension in the initial relationship between Hepburn and Bogart two odd fish brought together but both transform the other so you get personality development in the film.But in Cogburn there is no personality development and way too much chatter that makes you want to fall asleep. Hepburn is constantly spouting platitudes and homilies while Wayne has little more than cornball lines. The other movie this inevitably gets compared with is The Shootist Wayne's next and last film with Lauren Bacall ironically Bogart's long faithful wife. Here Wayne showed he could still act and there was real chemistry between Wayne and Bacall. I suspect when Bacall looks out the window crying the tears were real though she may have also been thinking of Bogie who like Wayne died of lung cancer. By the 1970s the problem was not that audiences were tired of Westerns so much as that it was hard to find new angles on this genre. Cogburn tries but needed a less routine plot. Rooster Cogburn falls into the end of the cowboy era Western with the judge firing him for killing too many bad guys but fails to develop the theme. The Shootist on the other hand succeeds wonderfully. Like Westerns at their best it uses the genre to tell the story of a man dying of cancer alone in a world that no longer has any use for gunslingers who did good but was hated by almost everyone. You see some similarities in Monte Walsh decades later. It is the movie Rooster Cogburn tried to be. In short a great Western transcends its genre. Rooster Cogburn unfortunately barely rises above a B movie even with the heavy lifting of its stars.The low point in the movie is a plastered Wayne doing skeet shooting and never missing but who can't stand up on his own and then drives off with a wagon full of nitroglycerin which could have blown up even with the most careful sober handlers. The movie would have been better off if it had. Cogburn is full of such improbable details. Why are they hauling bottles of nitroglycerin when there are also crates labeled dynamite? Dynamite invented in 1867 is stable in transport and made nitroglycerin which is extremely unstable and dangerous obsolete. Obviously based on the movie's rating there are fans of John Wayne who will watch anything he's made. But fans of Katherine Hepburn will be appalled for Rooster Cogburn is a disgrace to her memory. It is by far the worst movie she ever made I can't think of anything even close. If you imagine seeing this movie without knowing who the two stars are what you are left with is a lethargic overly long chase with some of the most atrocious dialog every committed by a major studio. The script is garbage that leaves a bad taste long after seeing it. So minus the stars this movie would rate somewhere between a 4 and a 2. It is really that bad.Still John Wayne and Katherine Hepburn could have been great in a Western together. I would have loved to have seen them in Going' South instead of Jack Nicholson and Mary Steenburgen especially in that scene with the brass bed and ropes. Hmmmm. You know that's what Rooster Cogburn needed for the Duke to tie Hepburn up and stick a gag in her mouth.".

True Grit is one of my favorite movies so I naturally want to regard its sequel as being sacred. Like most sequels Rooster Cogburn... and the Lady does not recreate the excitement of the original.The characters are not motivated the same way they were in True Grit. Rooster Cogburn is not being pushed by an impatient girl. Eula Goodnight is not driven by revenge only a desire for justice. Most of all there is a noticeable distance between the good guys and bad guys. With the exception of the raft scenes everyone is fighting behind cover. During the raft scenes the Gatling gun forces the villains behind cover. Other than a very brief opening sequence there is no facetoface fighting scene for John Wayne in Rooster Cogburn... and the Lady. The interplay between Rooster and Eula is what keeps this movie from being boring.".

Complemented by Katherine Hepburn long  term partner of another movie favourite Spencer Tracy this should have been a wonderful film. Unfortunately I don't believe it was! Continuity and  or reference to True Grit was almost non  existent. Too much of the script occurred in near dark scenes. Richard Jordan who I thought was terrific in the later production of Gettysburg seems to be one  dimensional. As for the Duke and Miss Hepburn they may have enjoyed working together but I thought there was some important ingredient missing in their acting. I thought someone planned a sequel six years after the originalto capitalise on potential box office returns. Sadly the Western had declined in audience interest by 1974 and I believe this film didn't gain much kudos except for its curiosity value. For me the John Wayne and Lauren Bacall pairing in The Shootist was much more magical and interesting a film which sadly too few watched.".

The movie and the story and everything else is just a showcase. If you were expecting a plot depth of dialog or realism don't go here.

Let the people get the real thing where they should get it in the cinemas. I rather hate those movies that pack the trailer with best they have and then there's nothing left than those 30 seconds of glory.A pity I can't talk about the story to avoid spoilers at this time I would just explain why it was excellent for methe way Kiriya rewrote this little piece of history and made a great thing out of it and one worth watching in a movie.it has anything that a blockbuster shall have but keeps a pure and decent heart and yes done at an extremely low budget under one million .the CG is in my opinion not intended to look like Iron Man Hollywood stuff but rather like Final Fantasy and I really hope people not being snobs about this because this is not the point. Besides I never felt that the CG isn't good or not good enough I didn't even feel it was a CG because the story moves on so fast and takes you in its stream you don't have the time or need to think twice.there are no gaps and goofs or illogical actions in the story linethe style is very solid the mix of AsianWestern costume design or architecture is continuous through the entire movie and nothing looks like a mistake or an accident or bad taste. The mix of true historical elements and modern elements dance etc keeps things real while traditional elements like the firefly constantly remind us it's also a fairy tale that we are watching.you will get to see all martial arts you would dream of and better than that though you will not get tired with repetitive  unnecessary warfight scenes.the cinematography is amazing at all times thanks to the elaborate costumes and architecture but the way that camera moves is one of the best new things too.all actors match their roles great casting and especially the lead actor Eguchi Yosuke is so universally good he could stand right next to Johny Depp in let's say Pirates of the Caribbean and be as good at it. By not looking extremely Asian he could be a Latino European someone rather easy to identify with for the rest of the world besides the Japanese viewers. Hirosue Ryoko is also a wise choice and quite familiar to us from her earlier international hit Wasabi or the recent Academy Awards winning DepartureOkuribitoLast I shall say I'm not that much into Japanese directors trying rather desperately to impress the Western world through their forcedartsybloodycruelavantgardedecadentsexual stuff I think a nicely shot good story is what we all badly need and this is the hardest part of it to get a thing that will improve human race. I am convinced that Goemon will do.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was the same with Casshern and it will be the same with Goemon. At this moment the film hasn't gotten as much exposure in the West but needless to say when it does the film community will be awash with disappointment and confusion. Why? I think it has a lot to do with the role of CGI in film today. Being largely the domain of larger Hollywood studios the technology has been used as a means of replacing reality emulating it to the point of near transparency. Jurrassic Park was one the first films to show that such a goal was even possible and effects have progressed so much further since then.It therefore are that a Hollywood films attempt to use CGI for enhancing reality or making an entirely new reality of their own. Sin City was made outside of the studio system and perhaps that is why it was made at all. 300 was a valiant attempt as well at using CGI to create the actual fantastical. On the other side of the coin Lord of the Rings though amazing for its depiction of monsters and creatures of the imagination ultimately had the purpose of bring THEM into OUR world.GOEMON like Casshern is an attempt to bring us into another world similar to our own but in so many ways different. The effects and design serve the purpose of creating an unreality of enhanced surreality mimicking the pages of comic books and the frames of animation. Visually it was never intended to fool the eye or make the fantastical 'real'. Like its predecessor it had loftier more artistic goals. The question is did the film reach them? In many ways it did but in many it fell short. In the running time of story there is certainly no lack of sumptuous composition and stunning colour. The action is hyperactive and generally defies the rules of the real world though they make total sense in the scheme of Goemon's. The sheer audacity of the large scale battles especially in the last quarter makes the viewer simultaneously bewildered and amazed. You have never seen this before outside of the imagination and the boundless universe of pen and paper. No Hollywood film would dare do it.And that is the film's dual strength and weakness. What it does is alien to a majority of film fans bred on Hollywood's particular brand. They have been fed so much in the way of safe challenges and formulaic product that their first instinct is to rebel against any films cutting against the grain. The beauty of GOEMON is that it isn't a Hollywood picture and therefore doesn't need to apply itself to pleasing a conservative demographic who are otherwise unable to accept what the film ultimately creates.That is not to say that it doesn't follow clichs and formulas of its own origin but the presentation is fresh and eccentric enough to counter them. The whole is entirely a product of Japan. It reflects the culture's own eclectic modern tastes while also preserving a filtered rendition of the old. It both revises and reinforces its subject matter forming it into something that is Japan and at the same time is not. It doesn't matter that most of the story never really happened. The vitality of the film is its lust for a life of its own and its characters while largely archetypal serve the mythic aspects the story perfectly because that is what myths are made of.GOEMON is a film that shouldn't be weighed against standards set outside its context. It is a film trying to shed the limitations forced upon it by a conservative industry and consuming public. It is a myth a comic book a video game an animation and an epic drama it is a lush and inspirational 'other world' and doesn't need to be constrained by our own. Films should not need to succumb to our ingrained demand for adherence to our reality. Go into the film with this in mind and your imagination will be enriched by it. Be unable to let those strictures go and I think that sadly you will miss out.".

Reality and fantasy swirl together in a overwhelming attack on the  senses with huge vistas sets and battle sequences born out of special  effects engulf the screen. It is both breathtaking and absurd. At times  the imagery seems straight out of something in your Xbox other  moments there are reminders of films like Sin City utilizing a moving  comic book effect. Sometimes it seems a little unrealistic but this is  brushed away before the scene has even ended as you are confronted by  another sensory overloaded.  Despite this special effects world there is also elements of brilliant  story telling one of pain suffering revenge hope and love. All  these elements combine to make an incredible journey for the viewer to  go on. There are a few moments of humour to lighten all this  bombardment up as well as some misty eyed moments I knew it was  coming but when Saizo's son was thrown into the cauldron the tears  welled up.  This is a superb film brilliantly combined different styles that tell  a human story and entertains to the fullest. My only fault was that  sometimes the special effects were too clearly special effects. But  this is a minor thing among a hugely enjoyable film experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mention Kazuaki Kiriya and Casshern inevitably comes to mind. After all that's the only feature film he had done since and it comes with plenty of CG used to create backdrops which no longer existed and effects used to overload the senses making what's on screen seem very much like a computer generated comic book with characters possessing superhuman prowess that are of course second nature since nothing is impossible in the virtual world. I had the opportunity to view this film on board an airplane but it's a good thing I held out in the hopes that it'll make it to the big screen here since Kiriya brings back the same technical formula for the telling of his tale of legendary ninja bandit Goemon Ishikawa.Played by Yosuke Eguchi in the titular role the folklore of Goemon is just like that of Robin Hood where a man of nobility becomes the bandit of the land robbing the rich and distributing the wealth obtained to the poor to ensure the narrowing of the richpoor divide. With each retelling the legend just grows so much that there's no more a definitive version of the story but stories which build upon one another to bring out the flavour and characterization of a known hero in 16th century Japan where feuding warlords ensure that peace is but a buzzword of a promise yet to be fulfilled to their people. This of course allows Kiriya to heap on loads of artistic license in his tale which is relatively complete with an origin story political intrigue a romance and plenty of fight sequences which will make the action junkie in you whoop for joy.Which of course is the mainstay for anyone who's watching this. Almost all the battle sequences here are far out and CG enhanced with steroids ranging from huge armies squaring off or individual one on one battles with out of this world weapons and moves reliant on dizzying camera work to bring out the dexterity of the combatants that you're left gasping for air sometimes as it loops all around the action. If there's a minor gripe then it'll be moments where such powers get forgotten which of course helps the narrative at its convenience otherwise we'll be faced with an indestructible superman that will make it rather boring.Themes of friendship loyalty betrayal and vengeance become staple in this period fantasy film especially when we learn of Goemon's allies which include his ninjitsu peer Saizo played by Takao Osawa whom I thought resonated more with the story given the plight he got put through. Also the episode with Saizo highlights how Kiriya focused a little more on the emotional aspects of the characters involved in its more dramatic moments and the writerdirector's knack of fusing together historical events such as the Battle of Sekigahara and the ascension of the Ieyasu Tokugawa and personnel into the narrative making it a richer experience for the audience and lending itself some grandeur in terms of epicnessDespite clocking slightly over two hours there are enough twists and turns here given changing loyalties and supporting role appearances by other legendary characters such as Hattori Hanzo Susumu Terajima the famed swordsman. Ryoko Hirosue has a flower vase role here as the love interest of Goemon who decided to do a noble thing of being sacrificed as a concubine of the deranged warlord but does little else other than to continue reminding Goemon how infatuated he is with her.The initial moments do require some getting used to as the visuals are built upon CG created landscapes but it'll soon build on you that without which a film like this could probably not be easily made. It's Kazuaki Kiriya's signature visual style and I had enjoyed Goemon very much so when it found some balance between its action scenes and its dramatic moments. Just so you know if I have to choose my favourite fight sequence it'll have to be Goemon and Hattori's duel in the last act which showed why one is master over the other.".

It should be more plain and simple story background as so much history character has been involved. overall i have come to see the style of Kazuaki Kiriya and this is what i came to see the movie for. But i could see an improvement on Kiriya attempt this time round. I do not want to comment about the over using of CG and background as its one of the style of Kiriya. Acting wise only Takao Osawa who portray Saizo score greatly on my books. Gori was a huge disappointment. I'm a big fan of Yosuke Eguchi but he seem not holding his role too well to make an impact. I will always remember the part of goemon buro as the story took a complete twist from the real history which kiriya and Osawa hugly impress me for this part onwards.Neverless i will be also waiting to get a blueray verion of this for the parts which impress me and Osawa acting on this.

After the outcome from this fight stop the film and imagine everything else worked out fine. Tokugawa wins and installs a relatively peaceful regime that lasts until 1800s. Then watch Samurai X 'Trust' and 'Betrayal' anime about end of Tokugawa periodwith English translations in which Kenshin  the protagonist  inspires respect and admiration but then do not watch the series where Kenshin is a gimp.

	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit I didn't know what to expect from this movie. My main reason for seeing it was that it was the only movie playing and I had a few hours to kill.The biggest surprise to me was the mash up of Asian and European styles. Suits of armor marble floors Gothic interiors kept me thinking of Germany and France. As for the Asian visual influences there was many a tiled roof and the tiered castles and palaces were impressive and included Gothic touches. Many of the villains had a decidedly Chinese flair to their costuming. The heroes were garbed in a more European style with grubby tunics and thick leather boots. In fact other than the opening festival scene and the hiphop dancing girls there seemed to be little Japanese influence o the costumes.Most of the score was strongly influenced by Howard Shore and John Williams with just a bit of Orff mixed in for good measure. It wasn't bad but it tended to use the same themes over and over. The same melodramatic piece was used in a funeral a scene of love a fight and more. It didn't always work and by the end of the movie I was tired of hearing it.The plot was a retelling of the end of the Japanese warring states period with fantastical elements added to it. The real history is full of passion betrayal and violence and lends itself well to an epic movie. I enjoyed the changes the movie made and how the fictional elements collided with reality. However I do wish that the movie had done more with its characters. Many of them were just flat and had no real characterization. You know the villains by their sneers and raspy voices. Heroes develop grim determination. And maybe have families. It felt like the only two who were developed were Chacha and Goemon. I don't count Goemon's friend and rival because to me showing someone has a family doesn't count enough mean development. Also parts of the story just seemed muddy and unfinished. Things that are dreadfully important are suddenly dropped and never spoken of again.To be fair my Japanese isn't the best. I'm sure there were details I missed. However the Japanese friend I saw the movie with only did slightly better at following the interchangeable characters and convoluted storytelling.The acting was soso. It's another Japanese movie the falls into the mindset where characters need only three voices somber cocky and yelling. While there can be additives to those voices such as cockyjocular vs. cockytaunting those are the three types and blending and building should not be expected. If our cocky villain or hero for that matter gets upset his voice will not natural build to show growing anger it will just shoot instantly to yelling. The only actor who really stood out is the entertainer Gori who brings overacting to a great height. He was Gori. And he was acting. Badly.The effects were strange. The lighting was often unusual and nothing ever looked real be it castle forest or grassy plain. Combine this with super jumps 1 vs. 1000 fights and CGI straight out of last years video games and the result is an audience questioning if we are supposed to take the melodrama seriously. And since it seems more time and effort was spent stylizing fights than smoothing out a plot I'm guessing the answer is no.Overall it was a fun movie. But it seems more appropriate for watching and laughing at the ridiculousness of it with friends than in the silence of a theater. It's main design concept of East meets West was visually interesting but I couldn't help but think they should have chosen a style and stuck with it. Or perhaps use authentic period clothing and styles or even the amp up the traditional costumes as in Sakuran.The main thing that kept repeating in my head while watching this was that it could have been good if it wasn't so bad.".

Many of the villains had a decidedly Chinese flair to their costuming. The heroes were garbed in a more European style with grubby tunics and thick leather boots. In fact other than the opening festival scene and the hiphop dancing girls there seemed to be little Japanese influence o the costumes.Most of the score was strongly influenced by Howard Shore and John Williams with just a bit of Orff mixed in for good measure. It wasn't bad but it tended to use the same themes over and over. The same melodramatic piece was used in a funeral a scene of love a fight and more. It didn't always work and by the end of the movie I was tired of hearing it.The plot was a retelling of the end of the Japanese warring states period with fantastical elements added to it. The real history is full of passion betrayal and violence and lends itself well to an epic movie. I enjoyed the changes the movie made and how the fictional elements collided with reality. However I do wish that the movie had done more with its characters. Many of them were just flat and had no real characterization. You know the villains by their sneers and raspy voices. Heroes develop grim determination. And maybe have families. It felt like the only two who were developed were Chacha and Goemon. I don't count Goemon's friend and rival because to me showing someone has a family doesn't count enough mean development. Also parts of the story just seemed muddy and unfinished. Things that are dreadfully important are suddenly dropped and never spoken of again.To be fair my Japanese isn't the best. I'm sure there were details I missed. However the Japanese friend I saw the movie with only did slightly better at following the interchangeable characters and convoluted storytelling.The acting was soso. It's another Japanese movie the falls into the mindset where characters need only three voices somber cocky and yelling. While there can be additives to those voices such as cockyjocular vs. cockytaunting those are the three types and blending and building should not be expected. If our cocky villain or hero for that matter gets upset his voice will not natural build to show growing anger it will just shoot instantly to yelling. The only actor who really stood out is the entertainer Gori who brings overacting to a great height. He was Gori. And he was acting. Badly.The effects were strange. The lighting was often unusual and nothing ever looked real be it castle forest or grassy plain. Combine this with super jumps 1 vs. 1000 fights and CGI straight out of last years video games and the result is an audience questioning if we are supposed to take the melodrama seriously. And since it seems more time and effort was spent stylizing fights than smoothing out a plot I'm guessing the answer is no.Overall it was a fun movie. But it seems more appropriate for watching and laughing at the ridiculousness of it with friends than in the silence of a theater. It's main design concept of East meets West was visually interesting but I couldn't help but think they should have chosen a style and stuck with it. Or perhaps use authentic period clothing and styles or even the amp up the traditional costumes as in Sakuran.The main thing that kept repeating in my head while watching this was that it could have been good if it wasn't so bad.";

The story is very robin hood but don't think that you have seen this before.

It is silly to complain that it isn't realistic. Iron Man and Batman were not realistic either but they were still great. I even liked the story line too. The action sequences are among the most thrilling I have ever seen in a martial arts flick and Goemon's double bladed katana sword engraved with the emperors Stamp spread militarism across the land is one of the coolest ninja weapons ever seen in a movie. As well as being entertaining this movie has the unique feature of being the only movie in the world to not be ruined by being dubbed into English. I know dubbing that is well done. Hard to believe but true. If you are a fan of action and are in the right mood check it out. You will love it!

	schema:headline " Crappy CGI incoherent plot";
	schema:reviewBody "This review will probably be a bit short since it was some time since I saw the movie when I'm writing this and I don't have everything in fresh memory. But my core concerns remain the same anyway.Well. First off. I don't mind movies with lots of CGI. In fact I can quite enjoy it. But if the CGI doesn't look convincing and is way too obvious even when it's clear that it's not supposed to be then it's a bad thing. You could instantly tell when something was computer animated and it stuck out like a sore thumb. The movie had some pretty moments. Especially in the scenes with the princess. But I'd say this is pretty much the only thing this movie had going for it.The characters were incredibly one dimensional and mostly lacked any sort of personality. I mean the princess that the main character was supposed to be protecting must've been the most pointless female lead ever. The only thing she did in the entire movie was look pretty and get into trouble so that the hero would have someone to protect. And as I understand it the entire plot of the movie was supposed to revolve around the fact that her innocence shouldn't be allowed to be harmed in any kind of way. Because well... that would be horrible right? Bohoo. I actually felt sorry for her. Poor girl that's not allowed to take any action on her own part and is treated like some porcelain doll that gets put up on a shelf so that she don't get hurt.Which brings us to the plot of the movie. This was such a mess that I don't even know where to begin. The entire first part of the movie starts by building up to one crucial point in the story. The scene on the ship when the emperor is supposed to get killed. This would've been the perfect place to end it. Every thread at least that I could keep track of had been resolved and it really looked like the final moment. The emperor falls a hundred meters with a noose around his neck and seemingly dies. Some other guy I don't remember who gets shot in the head and also seemingly dies. Yay. Everything is fine. But then suddenly by some weird twist of logic the emperor didn't die from getting hanged from a hundred meters up in the air. And the other guy didn't die from getting shot in the head. There's no explanation why. We're just supposed to accept it. That's just plain bad and lazy script writing.Suddenly the movie needs to rebuild its entire plot from the ground up because it already killed what little it had to begin with. From that point everything just becomes a mess. It eventually leads up to two factions fighting against each other about something that's never really touched upon. But at least there's an epic battle coming. And then the main character shows up and... does something for one reason or another. I might have missed a few details here like I said it was some time ago that I watched it but that's really the gist of it. Then we have the action scenes. Well. There's some flailing about with swords. But it ultimately feels really pointless. We're not given any reason to care about the action because it's so obvious the main character is immortal. He has thousands of soldiers against him but none of them ever so much as scratches him. Yawn Oh well. The best part of the movie was the ending credits because it was finally over and the brilliant Rosa by Violet UK was playing.".

	onyx:emotionText "This review will probably be a bit short since it was some time since I saw the movie when I'm writing this and I don't have everything in fresh memory. But my core concerns remain the same anyway.Well. First off. I don't mind movies with lots of CGI. In fact I can quite enjoy it. But if the CGI doesn't look convincing and is way too obvious even when it's clear that it's not supposed to be then it's a bad thing. You could instantly tell when something was computer animated and it stuck out like a sore thumb. The movie had some pretty moments. Especially in the scenes with the princess. But I'd say this is pretty much the only thing this movie had going for it.The characters were incredibly one dimensional and mostly lacked any sort of personality. I mean the princess that the main character was supposed to be protecting must've been the most pointless female lead ever. The only thing she did in the entire movie was look pretty and get into trouble so that the hero would have someone to protect. And as I understand it the entire plot of the movie was supposed to revolve around the fact that her innocence shouldn't be allowed to be harmed in any kind of way. Because well... that would be horrible right? Bohoo. I actually felt sorry for her. Poor girl that's not allowed to take any action on her own part and is treated like some porcelain doll that gets put up on a shelf so that she don't get hurt.Which brings us to the plot of the movie. This was such a mess that I don't even know where to begin. The entire first part of the movie starts by building up to one crucial point in the story. The scene on the ship when the emperor is supposed to get killed. This would've been the perfect place to end it. Every thread at least that I could keep track of had been resolved and it really looked like the final moment. The emperor falls a hundred meters with a noose around his neck and seemingly dies. Some other guy I don't remember who gets shot in the head and also seemingly dies. Yay. Everything is fine.

	schema:reviewBody "Like I was maybe you aren't expecting much more than a flashy fantasy action flick to dazzle a few brain cells for 2 hours. Certainly the DVD cover the IMDb description and the first 1520 minutes of the film fulfills that expectation we get a lot of action sequences following our hero Goemon the legendary 16th century Japanese Robin Hood character as he performs rapid fire feats of martial arts  agility that would make Superman turn in his cape. Aside we'll talk about the controversial cgi in a minute let's focus on story first.But what begins as a seemingly predictable comic book tale of good vs evil becomes a much more complex epic saga as characters' loyalties and motivations change as secrets are revealed and as the characters themselves evolve and question their own actions showing us that this is far more than a mindless good vs. evil tale. I won't ruin who'swho but I'll say by far my favorite character dynamic is the complex relationship between Goemon and his antagonist Saizo. At first it seems like a straightforward hunt to the death but buckle your seatbelt because it has a lot of unexpected twists  turns culminating in an awesome climactic scene.Similarly as the story twists  turns the it takes on the air of a political thriller where the answers aren't as simple as you'd expected. Don't worry if you're not up to speed on 16th century feudal Japanese politics the power struggle is frighteningly familiar and applicable today 500 years later. Of course don't let the political angle scare you off because it's still rooted in actionfantasy with plenty of eye candy visuals if that's all you want.Which leads us to the controversial use of cgi... Yes there's tons of cgi and yes the film was made in 2009 when cgi wasn't very realistic looking. So you might find yourself distracted by the video game look of the action scenes. But I think the video game look is exactly what the filmmakers were going for. But in this film's defense it was a bold stylistic choice in league with other heavycgi flicks like Sky Captain 2004 Sin City 2005 or the French flick Immortal 2004 which were the first films to depart entirely from traditional location filmmaking techniques in favor of green screen and post production. Here in Goemon we have a similar hyperstylized look that's not necessarily supposed to seem realistic and that could be a plus or a minus depending on how you like your flicks.The bottom line is that the story and character development not the look is what really impressed me about Goemon. It raised this seemingly simple action romp to an epic scale. In that respect not visually I would compare it to Zhang Yimou's Hero 2002 another surprisingly complex story proceeding from the simple premise of an assassin sent to kill a ruthless Emperor.".

Most of the time no one speaks to Dave except to tell him to get out. He spends his off hours drinking smoking doing drugs and having meaningless sex.

This includes Robin Wright who nearly matches Dave in the tortured soul department Sigourney Weaver Anne Heche Cynthia Nixon Ned Beatty Ben Foster Ice Cube and Steve Buscemi. The first hour feels like an Actor's Retreat as most every scene introduces another familiar face.Still as terrific as Harrelson is and as deep as the cast is the film is just too one note and downbeat and hopeless to captivate a viewer. I also found some of Moverman's camera work to be quite distracting and the sex club scene was pure overkill. Downward spiral is much too neutral a term to describe this character and ultimately that prevents the film from delivering any type of message.".

	schema:reviewBody "All four stars are for the cast. It's not their fault this movie is awful.Harrelson is great. He's an engaging actor totally believable. It's a shame the script isn't.Harrelson plays a brutal murderous cop who is caught beating down a black guy in the street. Yet his home life is ultra liberal he lives with two sisters with whom he's had two kids during separate relationships. One of his daughters is pushing boundaries yet Woody doesn't seem to challenge this one of the sisters is an artist again not exactly fitting in with the hardline discipline Harrelson is dishing out on the street. He's immediately defined as a sexist racist homophobe yet we're asked to believe that he's knocked up two intelligent lefty sisters who are still willing to accommodate him in their lives and indeed home despite his lifetime of indiscretions and violence and that he's managed to split this work and home life without a significant issue developing through the life of the girls the eldest of who is mid teens at least. The family dynamic could have been interesting but it wasn't explored at all really it just got crammed in and thus didn't fit with the character at all.The supporting cast is really strong and the acting is solid throughout but not one of the plots get developed and not one aspect reaches a conclusion. Obviously this was done on purpose but if I pay to see a film I want to see the whole ing film not just half a story! Buscemi has about three lines. Ice Cube who I rate highly has a handful of scenes as an internal investigator all of which are well enough constructed but end without any resolution. Robin Wright is great foxy as  but again other than to identify Harrelson as a paranoid womaniser we get nothing back. Anne Henche and Cynthia Nixon play his former partners and both are well played again but they're just sketches of characters as is Sigourney Weaver also restricted to about 3 minutes of screen time.Basically it feels like the first long episode in a made for TV series. If that was the case I'd certainly watch more because there is a lot there and the on screen talent is superb but as a stand alone film it's a massive let down and it goes absolutely nowhere at the end of 2 hours.Oh and the sex club scene is particularly pointless if any such scene can be. It just seems like a random bit of editing that has shoved a half idea into an already overstretched concept.".

The character Woodys playing does not feel he's doing anything wrong. And you have to admire the honesty he doesn't pretend he's a straight shooter. Sometimes you may admire him sometimes you may hate him. But you cannot say that he is fake.Having said that this matter will decide if you like or hate the movie.

Its that overzealousness that lands him in trouble thohe beats 2 people in the first ten minutes of the moviebut in both cases i think they were both understandably beatings given the circumstances. Meh whatever film starts piling things on for Harrelsonhaving been caught with a cell phone cam beating up the 2nd guy who was running away from him! he's then put on suspension and then he gets put under investigation which leads to...not a whole lot honestly.Film is a very shaggy dog storyNot much really happens throughout the movie other then just watching Woody Harrelson walk around and talk toughhe tries to bond with his teenage daughter he tries to make it right with his ex wives he tries to figure out what Internal Affairs wants to hear so he can get his job back and yeah that's about it really. I feel like the events of the end don't really add up to much and the big climactic scene at the ending is well again not much of anything really. Film is basically a 70's Esq character study of this guy and his life that seems to be arbitrarily falling apart around him. That said the film's well shot its nicely acted and not just by Harrelson the actress playing his teenage daughter i feel scores just as many points as Woody does in their handful of scenes together. There's enough here that you wish it was better instead of the mishmash stew we got going on here. still its worth a look on cable should you stumble on it.".

	schema:reviewBody "LAPD veteran Dave Brown is a vile disgusting man. He is a sexist racist womaniser drunkard dirty cop and patent homophobe. This incidentally is not my judgement of him but that of his own daughter. It's pretty accurate. How much does that tell you?Cowritten by James Ellroy and starring Woody Harrelson in the main role 'Rampart' serves both as compelling crime melodrama and scorching character study. When we first meet Brown the Harrelson character we take an immediate dislike to him. He stinks of corruption and arrogance he is a control freak whose selfishness and cynicism damage and infect all those around him. He has two daughters by two different women both sisters as chance would have it despite the fact that his adultery is an almost nightly occurrence he insists on living together with the two women and their respective children to 'keep the family' intact. The pain and despair this has caused is devastating.Yet this is a man quite capable of charisma and perhaps in the crudest sense possible charm. He can after all be seductive in a brilliant early scene we see him pick up a woman at his local bar first conversation then sex. His target is sensible and perhaps looking for a good time a friend maybe even a relationship. Her questions are amicable and fair. The disappointment after that vacuous act later on is captured with incredible insight and realism by the filmmaker.Dave's behaviour is often puerile and savage the weight of the law begins to force itself upon him when he is caught on camera almost beating a man to death after the latter crashed his vehicle into Dave's police car. The extent of his obstinacy and selfdelusion is mind blowing an amazing piece of cinematography in which the camera swings round in a circle abruptly cutting between Dave and his superiors during a heated discussion on the subject of his brutality emphasises the illogical but neverending egoism and suppressed insecurity that drive him. Sex as in most works with Ellroy's name attached plays a huge role. At first we think Dave is just producing excess testosterone or is simply a chauvinistic pig by nature. But we soon realise there is something desperate about his constant affairs about his insatiable need to control and assert his authority. Perhaps to confirm his masculinity or escape his problems. Certainly the brief relationship he strikes up with a lawyer as confused and desperate as he is in many ways sheds much light on Dave's character.I've seen it argued that Dave is completely immoral in other reviews. This isn't true. He may have ruined the lives of his family and everyone he has come into contact with but he does come to realise that. Too long he has spent running away from his responsibilities at least on the job he can fall back on the tired formal jargon that has etched itself on his brain. But what about his children? I think it would be unfair to give any more specifics on the plot. Technically this movie is something special intimately filmed with heavy usage of artificial lighting neon red in particular is used to great effect and a handful of brilliant sequences  including but by no means limited to an excursion into an underground bar where easy sex pervades the air. This is where we begin to see Dave at his most desperate and 'Rampart' is a formidable movie about a man well past his sellbydate whose brutality closedmindedness insecurity and immaturity have destroyed any chance of happiness he might ever have had and may well have destroyed the same thing for those nearest to him. There is a heartbreaking sequence near the end where for the first time Dave tries to speak to his children honestly in hope of salvaging his relationship with them. It is a film about despair about a corrupt society that has moulded a man whose failures and flaws are killing him from the inside out without mercy. His own childhood is left deliberately ambiguous but his father another corrupt cop seems to have been his role model. Thus the corruption and destruction seems to be continuing through the generations in ripples and circles. The possibility of redemption has certainly manifested itself by the end of the film. Hope has come at least for Dave's family. As far as he is concerned perhaps selfknowledge is the first step. The movie's final scene is a modification of the opening sequence and we have to ask ourselves can we see the change in Dave? There is no easy answer. There isn't meant to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Where do I start??Story Line  Story Logic1 I don't know about police in other cities but here in Los Angeles and most likely every major city in the U.S. cops do NOT drive around policing their neighborhood beat by themselves  there is ALWAYS two cops per car. Standard LAPD protocol and is also a safety issue working the beat for the cops. Yet in this movie the cop working the beat out of the Rampart Division  a notoriously dangerousdifficult part of LA  works the beat by himself. Bullsht. Wouldn't happen and didn't happen in 1999 when this movie takes place.The movie starts out with the cop Harrelson teaching a newbie who's driving with him but that storyline is gone after the first 8 minutes or so of the movie. And is an entirely pointless part of the story other than to show this cop is a sexist.2 After he's caught beating the crap out of someone he was chasing on camera he is NOT removed from his beat but stays on working his beat. Or maybe he's removed for a little while but is then back on the beat 20 minutes later with no explanation as to why he's back on the beat. Sorry filmmakerDirectorWriter of this horrible movie but why is he back on the beat? Would NEVER happen. He would be suspended with or without pay but would not be back on the street until everything is entirely resolved. What LAPD brass  in reality  would ever allow a cop back on the street beat after a firestorm of protests media etc? Did the cops caught beating Rodney King 8 years prior to this film's timeline go back on the street right after? NO. It's also a safety issue for the cop and a race relations issue for the City too.Why do the filmmakers defy story logic or even basic LAPD procedures like this? Are they that moronic in their storytelling? Apparently so.3 Why call this movie Rampart? What's the point? This movie has nothing to do with the RampartLAPD scandal of the late '90s. Nothing. Even the backstory of the Rampart scandal has virtually nothing to do with this film's storyline. It appears as though the filmmakers are just trading on the Rampart name and thus misleading prospective moviegoers that this will be about the LAPD  the Rampart scandal.Few people outside of LA know anything about Rampart so this name means nothing to them and is pointless. The story is about a corrupt cop period. It has nothing to do with any particular area of LA and ultimately just adds tarnish to a part of LA.The Movie Overall I can not could not find one redeeming thing about this train wreck of a film. It's boring it's redundant it defies logical sense and typical police department procedures.Here's an example of the redundant nature Sometime after the midpoint of the film Harrelson begins to show paranoia. Okay so presumably the director wanted to show him sinking mentally. Fine. A couple scenes is plenty. Why show scene after scene after scene of him being paranoid when that's the only purpose of those scenes? We got it let's get on with the story. Oh... but there is no real story that's the main problem with this film. Another reviewer said this film was like watching paint dry. That reviewer was too kind.Here's an example of something else that would never happen with the LAPD Late in the film Harrelson is running out of money for his attorneys defending him over his Rodney Kingstyle beating so he's going to bust up a neighborhood highstakes poker game and steal their money. He's now nearby by himself and in uniform with his police car remember he's inexplicably still able to work his beat while under investigation for police misconductbrutality. How is he going to legitimately bust up a poker game by himself with no backup? NEVER would happen. Even a corrupt cop couldn't do this and get away with it. Not in any major city in the U.S. For one thing Vice would be involved and secondly no bust would be attempted without numerous officers. A single cop wouldn'tcouldn't EVEN get the authority from his superiors to enter by himself.So what happens? Instead of the director having to go through with this incredibly unrealistic storyline he has 2 armed thugs show up and rob the game with Harrelson looking on. They were not in partnership with Harrelson although that approach in the story would have been more plausible. The thugs run out and one of the poker players runs out chasing after the armed thugs. Yeah riiiight... an unarmed poker player is going to chase armed thugs down the street.... So Harrelson runs after them all shooting  killing the innocent poker player and wounding one of the robbers. He then tells the wounded robber to take some of the money out of the robber's bag for himself and split and then plants a gun in the innocent poker player's hand. So if we didn't think Harrelson was bad enough at this point we can now dislike him even more.This movie is a COMPLETE MESS with no real story just a bunch of scenes strung together with the same sht happening in every scene. There's an attempt to show that Harrelson is old LAPD and the department is changing but this is NOT a developed storyline. How did the DirectorWriter even get financing for this piece of crap?? I'll tell ya this The movie will make no money when it's released supposedly in January and if this Director wants a career as a Director he'd better learn how direct and tell a cogent story.".

So if we didn't think Harrelson was bad enough at this point we can now dislike him even more.This movie is a COMPLETE MESS with no real story just a bunch of scenes strung together with the same sht happening in every scene. There's an attempt to show that Harrelson is old LAPD and the department is changing but this is NOT a developed storyline. How did the DirectorWriter even get financing for this piece of crap?? I'll tell ya this The movie will make no money when it's released supposedly in January and if this Director wants a career as a Director he'd better learn how direct and tell a cogent story.";

Yet forced to confront the degree to which I live only for my own compulsions at the price of those I hold dear.A very hard work to digest with unfortunately a major let down of an ending. After dragging you though the muck for nearly two hours you're left hanging.Perhaps Rampart's greatest strength is in providing a very accurate example without being preachy of what a person's life will become when heshe shuts out all the people around them and lives only for himherself and hisher compulsions.Rampart can easily serve as mandatory viewing for anyone dealing with addiction in any one of its multifaceted forms. Perhaps by witnessing such an extreme case as is portrayed in this film the viewer can see the necessity for redemption. The consequences of not doing so resulting in the spiral into selfdestruction that Woody Harrelson's character experiences in this film.Wonderfully acted by all involved who elevate this film beyond its own meanderings. Anne Heche's character has a delicious scene at the end where she just gets to nail Harrelson but good. That must have been a lot of fun for her. And terrific work from the young actress playing Harrelson's daughter.A very troubling film but one that deserves major props for originality. I think it took a lot of bravery to make a film like this that is in a way such and antifilm. It's amazing something as difficult and unrewarding for the viewer as this film is could get made in today's climate of pandering to focus groups etc. Still this film does kind of suck. But it kinda sucks for all the right reasons. It sucks because it's not Training Day or Bad Lieutenant. It's not some thrillride wishfulfillment fantasy of how much fun it would be to be a badass cop who goes out with a bang in the end. Nor is it a dramatic recreation of real life events to better understand a moment of historical significance. Yet this film is the real deal. If it weren't for the striking cinematography and terrific acting work from recognizable faces you'd swear you were watching a documentary.I suppose that's why I'm left hanging at the end. And I suppose I'm alright with that. Kudos!".

He covers everything in this role brutality being a smartass father in a very dysfunctional family as well as womanizer. This is a great role for him and the movie is very much worth watching.

James Ellroy never pulls punches when it comes to describing the testosterone fueled psychopathy that informs the average police mentality. A very small percentage of the human population can actually kill another human being even in selfdefense so it takes a rare breed of empathy challenged men and women to do what cops do. The worst of the lot like Woody Harrelson's character are further hampered by what is clearly a trauma based condition that manifests itself in the legalized hostility that this character's uncontrollable appetites are enabled by. His arrangement with women even intelligent women as portrayed in the film is very primitive and more common than you might think though usually in star studded films this polygamous mentality is celebrated as enlightened. Here Harrelson has in effect a multigenerational harem of codependents believe me one of those daughters will end up in the sack with their old man if he isn't stopped. By the end of the film it's clear that his oldest daughter even though intimated that she is a lesbian perhaps in selfdefense perhaps as a reaction to the example of male degeneracy displayed by her father has similar dents in her psyche and that the contagion will be passed on to the next generation. You don't see this dark side of the human condition in major motion pictures and especially not within the police procedural where as the endless forensic shows on television lie to us daily police are dedicated white knights of empirical truth who let blind justice run its course. Ellroy portrays himself as a far right wing nut and it often plays as an act to sell books but it's also true that the LAPD are amongst his biggest supporters and sometimes to get an accurate account of the far right it takes one of their own to really show the truth. Whether you think this is actual entertainment or not I think it is a brilliant and exciting piece of filmmaking and I am looking forward to Moverman's next film whatever that may be Rampart is at least a very important essay on the ways and means of the high functioning and dangerously responsible psychopath.".

	schema:headline " Sympathy for Dave  Date Rape Brown";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe some of the negative posts written about this movie and although it isn't without its flaws it is still film worthy of your valuable viewing time. That is if you consider yourself as anything of a serious cinema enthusiast as opposed to a common or garden movie fan. I have given it a maximum score of 10 stars not that it deserves 10 stars but just to attempt to redress the balance a little.It isn't a feel good entertainment it is grim it is seedy and although I didn't find it harrowing I could quite understand if some viewers did. However I actually finished up having quite a lot of sympathy for the Dave Brown character. I feel he is a man who works to his own moral compass he has served his country in Vietnam and his community as a police officer he tries to be a good father. If he can bust a meth lab by roughing up a shop lifter then so be it. He allegedly murdered a serial rapist. He is the type of cop that Hollywood movies and the popular culture glorify the tough cop whose unconventional methods get results. Only this is real life and as such he is betrayed at every turn his country betrays him for being a soldier in an unpopular  i.e. losing  war the Police department he works for is out to pin him to the wall as a diversion from the more endemic scandal it has to face his friends  I'm thinking the Ned Beaty character General and his lover  turn there back on him and finally his family turn on him too. You may say he deserves it but I don't think so.All the performances from the first rate cast are great you can really see them getting there teeth into the roles. Much of it looks and feels like ad lib particularly any scene involving Dave and one of the many women in his life. The movie is shot in a cross between a gritty fly on the wall documentary style and surveillance footage. Many scenes are filmed through a foreground object like through the branches of a bush or the gap in a curtain or through a window. Some are filmed from far away as if the viewer was a peeping Tom or surveillance operative and it gives weight to Dave's feelings of paranoia. Through this lens LA is a soulless grimy squalid and above all dangerous place to be which is about right. It is a foreign and alien world even to its native inhabitants. That is the world through Dave Brown's eyes it is A truth but not necessarily THE truth. If the film is about injustice racism sexism and intolerance then what does it say of our intolerance of Dave Brown? Until we have seen the world through his eyes who are we to judge?".

	onyx:emotionText "I can't believe some of the negative posts written about this movie and although it isn't without its flaws it is still film worthy of your valuable viewing time. That is if you consider yourself as anything of a serious cinema enthusiast as opposed to a common or garden movie fan. I have given it a maximum score of 10 stars not that it deserves 10 stars but just to attempt to redress the balance a little.It isn't a feel good entertainment it is grim it is seedy and although I didn't find it harrowing I could quite understand if some viewers did. However I actually finished up having quite a lot of sympathy for the Dave Brown character. I feel he is a man who works to his own moral compass he has served his country in Vietnam and his community as a police officer he tries to be a good father. If he can bust a meth lab by roughing up a shop lifter then so be it. He allegedly murdered a serial rapist. He is the type of cop that Hollywood movies and the popular culture glorify the tough cop whose unconventional methods get results. Only this is real life and as such he is betrayed at every turn his country betrays him for being a soldier in an unpopular  i.e. losing  war the Police department he works for is out to pin him to the wall as a diversion from the more endemic scandal it has to face his friends  I'm thinking the Ned Beaty character General and his lover  turn there back on him and finally his family turn on him too. You may say he deserves it but I don't think so.All the performances from the first rate cast are great you can really see them getting there teeth into the roles. Much of it looks and feels like ad lib particularly any scene involving Dave and one of the many women in his life. The movie is shot in a cross between a gritty fly on the wall documentary style and surveillance footage. Many scenes are filmed through a foreground object like through the branches of a bush or the gap in a curtain or through a window. Some are filmed from far away as if the viewer was a peeping Tom or surveillance operative and it gives weight to Dave's feelings of paranoia. Through this lens LA is a soulless grimy squalid and above all dangerous place to be which is about right. It is a foreign and alien world even to its native inhabitants. That is the world through Dave Brown's eyes it is A truth but not necessarily THE truth. If the film is about injustice racism sexism and intolerance then what does it say of our intolerance of Dave Brown? Until we have seen the world through his eyes who are we to judge?";

If you didn't think you saw the full potential of Woody in The Messenger then you may have a redemption in Rampart as he plays an all out brutal and uncompromising cop. Ben Foster on the other hand bows down to take a less stellar role here I didn't realize who was playing his part until I saw a few closeups of the character but his chemistry with Woody is mostly intact and there is some important dialog between these two. It's just this is clearly Woody's vehicle and nobody even comes close to his driver's seat.Woody's Dave Brown makes his relentless attitude apparent early when he's bent on grilling a young female cop for ordering excess food that she has no intention to consume. It's only the beginning of his alienation from every woman in his life though. He treads on a selfdestructive route as he eats vomits and ruts like a complete beast under a little influence. Near the end we're reminded that he is only a human after all and that's when we also realize he probably hasn't raised a hand against a woman once. A beast with a heart  an oxymoron only experienced actors can make believable.".

	schema:headline " Film scenarists allow loose cannon but charming rogue cop to devolve into paranoid selfhating loser";
	schema:reviewBody "Right after watching 'Rampart' I was pretty impressed by Woody Harrelson's performance as a rogue LAPD cop circa 1999. But the more I thought about the whole story I began to question how could such a narrative be truly reflective of reality. The film is cowritten by famed crime novelist James McEllroy and Oren Moverman well known for his last feature the implausible 'The Messenger'. I'm going to assume that most of the implausible moments in the film and they are legion are attributable to Mr. Moverman and not McEllroy who is responsible for such gritty realistic neonoirs as 'L.A. Confidential'.Rampart really has no connection to the late 90s LA police scandals of the same name and is only used as a backdrop as we follow Woody Harrelson's rogue Police Officer Dave Brown on the crimeridden streets of LA. When we're introduced to Brown he's paired with a young female officer in a patrol car but soon he's depicted as traveling solo would the LAPD have allowed its officers to be on patrol by themselves in a high crime areaor for any area for that matter?.Many critics and internet posters see Brown as some kind of monster from the beginning. True he does rough up a petty larceny suspect who Brown is convinced knows more about a bigger crime about to take place. When another thug apparently rams his car into Brown's cruiser and tries to make a run for it Brown catches up to him and administers an unhealthy dosage of street justice. Brown's blows are caught on videotape and later there is the suggestion that all this was a setupthat LAPD needed a fall guy to draw attention away from the Rampart scandal itself. Hence not only do the film's scenarists implicate one dirty cop but now the entire department is suspect.For a good first half of the film to my mind the events suggest that we should view Brown sympathetically. He's actually quite witty and enjoys defending himself especially when he's held to the fire by a tough District Attorney brilliantly played by Sigourney Weaver. Brown is given the nickname 'Date Rape' a moniker even pejoratively applied to him by his own daughter. It seems that Brown murdered a date rape suspect years ago and was never prosecuted. Brown uses that incendiary history to score points with women who seem to admire him for his past bad boy antics Robin Wright is one 'victim' a saucy defense attorney who beds Brown on more than one occasion. Also in the mix are Brown's exwives two sisters who each have a child by him.After the police brutality case is in full swing against him quite unbelievably LAPD does not suspend Brown but allows him to continue 'walking the beat'. The implication is that the Department is hurting due to budget cuts. Brown needs money to pay his lawyers so he gets a tip about a robbery about to go down from a toughasnails excop expertly played by Ned Beatty.At this point the decision is made by the film's screenwriters to take down the loose cannon but charming rogue cop and turn him into a selfhating paranoid loser. Brown goes after the robbers he got the tip on but ends up shooting and killing an innocent victim. To make matters worse he plants a gun on the murdered crime victim lets one of the perpetrators leave with some of the loot keeping the rest for himself. If this isn't enough Brown begins to drink almost kills himself mindlessly trolls through a seedy sex club and is finally asked to leave his home by his exwives which he was already kicked out of after arriving for a visit.A brief visit from his daughters at the hotel he often books himself into only adds to the rogue cop's sense of despair as they walk out on him after he admits to being guilty about all of the bad things said about him on the local news.At film's end we truly have a sense that screenwriters really had no idea how to end their film. The story simply peters out with Brown meeting the DA Investigator convincingly played by Ice Cube and asking to cut a deal where he'll confess to the old date rape charges if the current robbery charges are dropped. The investigator laughs at him indicating that he won't take the bait and pointedly stating that the current charges will stick and he'll end up in prison.'Rampart' reminds me of some of the old films from the 30s AFTER the Hays Code went into effect where the bad guys must receive their comeuppance. Rampart's writers more likely Moverman than McEllroy insisted that Brown be thrown under the bus since any character who claims to hate everybody must ultimately be taken down.Still I detect a trace of a slight touch of ambivalence in the writer's attitude toward the rogue cop. Could it be a case of Hate the sin but not the sinner? Woody Harrelson manages to pull off a top notch performance as an over the top and often out of control rogue cop but it's too bad he ends up with a severe case of selfhatred at the denouement. Despite his severe shortcomings somehow this law enforcement maverick deserved better from the film's creators.".

I think the writing and Moverman's mettle attracted the high profile performers in supporting roles. However it can be initially distracting to see such folks appear as it takes a few moments for one to acknowledge their presence and again suspend disbelief. Though I would not have made this observation if the site did not require at least 10 lines of text in a review. The observation that big name actors can be a distraction in small roles did not originate with me. The obvious solution to this dissonance is to expand the supporting roles of such talented accomplished actors. I think it must be difficult to do noir in LA with all those pastels and sunlight. In Rampart it is the subject matter the script and the performances that create the dark selfdestructive trajectory that propels the protagonist into his hellish alienation.".

Although the shortest it also was the most dangerous route because Bailey Mountain was the stronghold of a band of renegade Apache led by Chief Diablito. A group of land surveyors is attacked and massacred by Diablito's renegade Apache. The Indians abduct Mary Carlyle the daughter of General Carlyle. As a result of this Major C. E. Breverly commandant of the nearby cavalry outpost sends a scout to find prospector and Indian guide Ward Kinsman. Kinsman is secretly mining for gold near Bailey Mountain under the nose of Chief Diablito. At the cavalry outpost Major Breverly requests Kinsman's assistance in saving Mary Carlyle from the Apache. Mary's sister Ann Duverall also demands her sister's immediate rescue but Kinsman fearing a great loss of troopers in a confrontation with the Apache refuses. Not being on the army's payroll allows him to refuse assignments. However he ...";

	schema:reviewBody "MGM's Ambush  a forgotten above average fifties western  has finally turned up thanks to the Warner Bros. Archive label with their release of the picture in a fine DVD transfer that should now set it on the road to some sort of rediscovery. Produced for Metro in 1950 by Armand Deutsch it was directed with a modicum of flair by Sam Wood who himself was something of a stranger when it came to directing westerns. Forgetting his best forgotten 1940 B picture Rangers Of Fortune AMBUSH really would be the estimable director's first and as it turned out only venture into the genre. From a story by Luke Short it was nicely written for the screen by Marguerite Roberts and was superbly shot in Gallup New Mexico in black  white by Harold Lipstein. And complimenting the film throughout is a rich score  featuring a spirited cavalry march  by Austrian composer Rudolph Kopp. AMBUSH also was the first real western the picture's star Robert Taylor would appear in if you discount the lamentable and dull Billy The Kid which he illadvisedly did in 1941. AMBUSH would now put the actor on the trail so to speak to make something of himself in westerns with the excellent Devil's Doorway1950 Westward The Women 1951 Ride Vaquero 1953 and The Law  Jake Wade 1958.Mescalero Apache leader Diablito Charles Stephens is on the warpath. He is raiding and killing whites all along the border. He also captures and enslaves white women. One such woman is Mary Carlyle Marta Mitrovich and it falls to the U.S. cavalry at the Fort Gambel outpost to rescue her. With the help of army scout Ward Kinsman Robert Taylor officer in charge Capt. Ben Lorrisonn John Hodiak leads a large contingent of troops into the hills to engage with and wipe out Diablito once and for all and retrieve the woman. But things don't go too well with internal bickering and disputes between the straitlaced and uncompromising Captain and Kinsman and between the Captain and the young Lt. Linus Delaney Don Taylor who is having an affair with an enlisted man's wife Jean Hagan back at the fort. They eventually encounter the Apaches and after Kinsman stampedes their horses and they are trapped in a canyon a fierce struggle ensues. Finally with most of the Apaches and troops wiped out including Lorrison and Diablito Kinsman does manage to rescue the woman.It is almost inconceivable that a western with the leading actor who was once named Spangler Arlington Brugh could for a moment be taken seriously. It must surely be a comedy you would ascertain. But you would be quite mistaken for this indeed was Robert Taylor's real name before he changed it and a blessing it is too that he did so. Watching him here in AMBUSH you would find it difficult to associate him with such a name since he turns in an excellent robust performance as the rough and tough army scout. Excellent too is the illfated John Hodiak the likable Don Taylor and Charles Stephens as the fearsome Apache leader in a role he would play many times in westerns of the period. Interestingly Stephens in real life was the grandson of the famous Apache leader Geronimo.AMBUSH is a neat little western that is well paced well written well played and well directed by Sam Wood who unfortunately never lived to see the release of his finished movie. He died of heart failure soon after the film wrapped.Footnote Sharp eyed western fans will notice Fort Gambel as the one and the same location as that for Fort Bravo in Escape From Fort Bravo three years later. Both were filmed at the Ray Corrigan Ranch in Simi Valley California. Also in Fort Bravo Charles Stephens had a minor part as an Apache army scout.".

This is a truly good western about an Indian scout Ward Kinsman played by Taylor. He is pursued by the army to scout a journey to find the sister of Ann Duverall Arlene Dahlwho has been kidnapped by a renegade Apache. At first he says no but is attracted to Dahl and alienates her from her romantic Army Captain Ben Lorrison played by John Hodiak who costared with Taylor on several occasions including the Bribe. The other romances are center stage with a young Don Taylor pursuing the wife of an enlisted man who is an wife beater. Jean Hagen plays the wife with great apprehension knowing she is love with Don Taylor but staying because it is her religion. None of the romance can however outshine the great outdoors the Indian fights the bravery of the soldiers and Robert Taylor who when he starts the film is unshaven dirty and just as real as I am sure Luke Short wrote the part. A wonderful western with all the elements of gritty realism of the book. A must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ambush was the second western Robert Taylor made in his career. The first was Billy the Kid eight years earlier. At the time a critic said that Robert Taylor looked like a kid in his new cowboy suit as Billy. Truth be told that was in Taylor's heartthrob days and he did look somewhat callow in the part.No one would ever say that about Ambush. When we first meet Taylor he's with sidekick scout John McIntire with several days growth dirty and unkempt and on the dodge from Apaches. Of course he and McIntire escape and return to the fort they're assigned to and find a new spit and polish second in command in John Hodiak.Even after a shave and a bath Taylor looks gritty and tough and starts to get interested in Arlene Dahl who is the daughter of a general and who's getting the army to go after her sister who's been captured by the same band of Apaches that Taylor just escaped from. Even though he knows it will cost lives Taylor scouts for the mission. He also wants to tweak Hodiak a bit who also is interested in Dahl.There's another romantic triangle going at the post. Young lieutenant Don Taylor is interested in Jean Hagen the post laundress who's married to a wife beating enlisted man Bruce Cowling. This was the last film of director Sam Wood who possibly because of his right wing political views is not as well remembered today as a lot of his contemporaries. He received three nominations for Best Director for Kitty Foyle Goodbye Mr. Chips and King's Row. He did such other classics as Pride of the Yankees A Day At the Races A Night at the Opera and Our Town. That's a pretty good resume.This maybe a cavalry picture but it's not like one that John Ford would have directed. It's got some lean and mean characters and I don't mean just the standard villains. Ford would never have had anything as frank as out and out adultery in one of his films.Ambush is a great western for fans of the genre and others. And after this no one was going to give Robert Taylor a review like the one he got for Billy the Kid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ambush is directed by Sam Wood and adapted to screenplay by Marguerite Roberts from a Luke Short serial story. It stars Robert Taylor John Hodiak Arlene Dahl Jean Hagen Don Taylor and John McIntire. Music is by Rudolph G. Kopp and cinematography by Harold Lipstein. In 1878 the shortest trail West through the territory of Arizona crawled across the foot of Bailey Mountain... The shortest trail but the most dangerous. For Bailey Mountain was the stronghold seized by Diablito and his hostile Apaches Nice! A Western movie for Western movie lovers to sink their teeth into. It's not exactly wall to wall action on offer here but there is an adultness to proceedings that hits all the right chords for the discerning audience. The opening scene shows us the aftermath of an Apache raid then it's introductions to the main characters who will come together to go rescue a kidnapped white woman from Diablito's Apaches. The build up isn't rushed we are drawn into the lives of the American Fort residents their love triangles and frets while mature themes of adultery and spouse abuse are given some skilled direction and performances. Once traits and peccadilloes are established the band of not so merry men go off to fight the Apache the latter of which are thankfully shown as a resourceful foe with some cunning tactics. Taylor saddles up for a scuzzy portrayal honourable for sure but happily dirty and his character is shown to be fallible in one of the many machismo contests that permeate the story. Hodiak offers some elegance Hagen some emotional punch while Dahl  costumed to enhance her curvaceous figure  lights up every scene she is in. The great Harold Lipstein photographs much of the picture through black and white film noir filters adding the requisite turbulence to the story while Wood in what was his last motion picture directorial assignment directs with assuredness and makes the most of the Simi Valley and Gallup locations. McIntire is wasted and Bruce Cowling as the violent husband is only just convincing while the blending of painted backdrops with the gorgeous locales becomes a little distracting in the final quarter. Yet as any hardcore Western fan will tell you often those sort of things are forgiven if the makers don't insult our intelligence which is thankfully the case here. 710".

McIntire is wasted and Bruce Cowling as the violent husband is only just convincing while the blending of painted backdrops with the gorgeous locales becomes a little distracting in the final quarter. Yet as any hardcore Western fan will tell you often those sort of things are forgiven if the makers don't insult our intelligence which is thankfully the case here. 710";

	schema:headline " Powerhouse Western!";
	schema:reviewBody "Ambush is a gripping authentic actionpacked dramatically compelling picture of the United States Cavalry in the 1870's Arizona territory. It was producerdirector Sam Wood's final movie filmed shortly before his sudden death in September 1949 and released in January 1950. For top star Robert Taylor now in his early forties weathered but gracefully aged it was an auspicious beginning to what would be a close association with the Western genre for the rest of his career.While there is plenty of action in Ambush its intense nuanced character studies are what sets this dynamic Western apart from the crowd. Taylor plays a tough savvy civilian scout at odds with by the book Army captain John Hodiack both over campaign strategy and the affections of gorgeous Arlene Dahl a late general's daughter hoping the cavalry can rescue her sister from Apache captivity. As if one love triangle were not enough for a dusty little Army post the first lieutenant Don Taylor is madly and hopelessly in love with the beautiful Irish laundress Jean Hagen the loyal Catholic wife to a drunken lout of an enlisted man Bruce Cowling who frequently socks her around. When a disabling injury to the major in command of the post Leon Ames puts the spitandpolish captain temporarily in charge everything comes to a boil. Not as soapy as it sounds but sensitively directed by Wood and perfectly acted by all concerned. The scenes of poignant longing tinged with guilt between Don Taylor and Ms. Hagen nearly steal the show. The rich supporting cast includes as well as Ames and Cowling John McIntire as an older scout Pat Moriarity as the top sergeant and also Charles Stevens who claimed descent from Geronimo as the vicious resourceful Apache leader Diablito.The script by Marguerite Roberts from a Luke Short story is intelligent and engaging with clever brisk colorful dialog. Harold Lipstein's moody black and white cinematography and Rudolph G. Kopp's textured score enhance the gritty realistic yet slightly nostalgic ambiance. Editing is silky smooth as in almost any big studio picture of this era. The all important pacing is perfect. The compact 89minute running time moves along at a brisk pace building suspense never dragging but taking enough breathers to build character and create atmosphere. Costumes and sets are firstrate and authentic. Reallife western Army forts during the Indian War era did not have palisade walls and refreshingly neither does the one in this handsomely turned out Western. More importantly the characters act like nineteenth century people with the social attitudes of the time yet without seeming stiff.With apologies to John Ford fans which includes yours truly Ambush is the best of its type. Whereas Ford who liked to portray everything bigger than life tended to make the cavalry too grand and romantic Wood gives us the real Old West Army  longservice soldiers serving loyally but thanklessly at dusty out of the way posts neither finding nor expecting much in the way of comfort or glory.Ambush is a thrilling dramatic atmospheric authentic adult Western engaging charming and entertaining from beginning to end. The opening and closing scenes of this picture are both real knockouts! This is an unappreciated classic. Topnotch entertainment from Old Hollywood's Golden Era.".

	schema:headline " A Black and White Horse Opera That Should Have Been In Color And Free Of Ratings!";
	schema:reviewBody "I am of the opinion that Ambush comes off as a standard black and white horse opera for two reason. First off as I was watching the film I couldn't help but wonder as to how much better of a film it could have been if it had been filmed in gorgeous Technocolor which would have emphasized the beautiful Monument Valley type of surroundings. Secondly the film being a product of it's time 1949 was limited to the morality and the censorship that most assuredly was imposed on it. In other words various organizations such as Catholic Legion Of Decency played a big part in what could be portrayed during the context of the film's plot and what was presented on the screen i.e. if any studio violated their code of ethics that appeared in the good old Sunday Visitor a Catholic publication the Legion of Decency would give it a C for Condemned or a MO for Morally Objectionable to discourage patrons from going to theaters to see the film. The plot of this film has Lt. Linus Delaney Don Taylor falling for an enlisted man's wife Martha Conovan Jean Hagen. The woman's husband Tom Conovan Bruce Cowling is an abusive drunk that continuously beats his wife and eventually becomes an army deserter. Rest assured that their is no hope for this star struck couple ever to find happiness! Obviously there is only one way for a taken woman to get the other man....and that is for the out of luck husband or fianc to die. Enter Captain Ben Lorrison John Hodiak a fool hardy Officer reminiscent of Henry Fonda in Fort Apache. In other words a man who will not listen to someone that has been there and knows what and when to do it as exemplified by a scout Ward Kinsman Robert Taylor. Taylor inadvertently falls for Hodiak's girl Ann Duverall Arlene Dahl but he has two things going for him that the other Taylor doesn't have 1Dahl is not married to Hodiak and 2Hodiak is a prideful by the book officer and his stubbornness to attack the Indians when he has been heeded not to eventually gets him killed. Alas! Robert Taylor gets Dahl while Don Taylor and Jean Hagen sadly stare at each expressing a tearful wordless Goodbye while humoring the good old Catholic Legion of Decency. I don't know about you guys out there...but I always looked at my good old Sunday Visitor to check out the movies I wanted to see and I didn't let those darn old Condemned or Morally Objectionable get in my way of my entertainment.".

	schema:headline " It's nice to see Taylor in a film when he wasn't all that pretty!";
	schema:reviewBody "In the 1930s Robert Taylor was hugely successful playing pretty boy roles. This isn't meant to demean his talents but the idea of him playing a gritty part at that time was about as believable as Marjorie Main playing romantic lead in a Clark Gable film! However by the midlate 1940s Taylor filled out a bit and as he approached his 40s he was suddenly finding himself in several gritty cop filmsbut he still was a bit on the pretty side. However with Ambush Taylor makes a break with this matine idol image as the film finds him dirty and unshaven through eh first 20 minutes. And instead of begin well dressed and sexy he was a frontiersman who was used to fighting Indians and roughing it. I liked the new Robert Taylor look and stylehe was grittier and more believable and seemed to grow older quite well.The story is pretty typical of many westerns of the day. There is a renegade Indian Diablito Little Devil who has killed a group of settlers and took the women and children prisoners. While Indians did sometimes take women and children into their tribe this way the notion of renegades is a bit of a misnomer as this sort of thing was pretty rare in the westdespite what you see in films. As for Taylor he is asked to guide the cavalry to find the prisoners but he's less than thrilled with the idea as he thinks it's pretty useless. Ultimately however he relents and leads a small group of soldiers to Diablito's camp. In a couple scenes he's shown conversing with the natives in their language. While I assume he's speaking gibberish it did sound pretty good and I'd love to know if he's actually saying anything.Aside from this plot there are subplots that give the film some depth. In other words it's not just a film about killing Indians. there is a subplot involving a drunk brute named Conovan who amuses his longsuffering wife and goes so far as tries to kill the commanding officer! Acting commanding officer John Hodiak is a toughasnails guy who is awfully rigidand not the sort to work out the Indian problem with any finesse. So as you can see it's not just a Robert Taylor film but it's more complex than that. Plus in one scene where Taylor and Hodiak get in a fistfight it's interesting to see Taylor the once prettyboy lose! This certainly isn't the Taylor film of old! Overall there's nothing that unique about this western though it still is very good and definitely better than the typical film of the genre and frankly I think there have been way too many westerns over the years. I also appreciated how the natives actually looked like they were AmericanIndiansnot the white guys in paint like many films. And I liked how they had intelligent battle plansnot the usual riding right into the whithering gunfire of the good guys or riding in circles around a wagon train which didn't actually occur while they get shot!! By the way I agree with the review by bkoganbing. While John Ford made quite a few cavalry and western films this sort of film isn't his style at all and can't be confused for one of his films. Sam Wood's style and direction is much more directand this film lacks the overt sentiment of a Ford film. It is simple unflinching and well madethe final film of an accomplished but mostly overlooked director now in the 21st century.".

Of course there's a love triangle between those two and Army Capt. Ben Lorrison John Hodiak to make this film more steamy than necessary. And of course Robert Taylor reluctantly agrees to help find the woman since he is falling in love with Dahl and really can't refuse her.What complicates things even further is another love triangle between Lt.

It's too bad all this nonsense chews up too much of the film because this oater had a lot of potential.What saves this from being a total soap opera is the decent battle scenes at the end of the film. The Calvary knows where the Apaches are massing and ambush them inside a canyon. The second ambush involves those Apaches who have escaped this first battle led by their chief Diablito Charles Stevens who hide in holes on the vast plain and ambush John Hodiak's patrol. They hide in their covered holes and wait until they are on top of them.All but the master Sgt. Mack Pat Moriarity are killed in the ensuing gun battle thereby freeing Robert Taylor to hook up with Dahl and Don Taylor to hook up with the now widowed Hagen. No more Hodiak. No more Cowling. A little too convenient I think.And all this loveydovey stuff brings what would otherwise have been an exciting western down a couple of notches. So I'm gonna only give it a 5 out of 10 for complicating things more than need be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Taylor's second western director Sam Wood's final film Ambush finds him on the right side of the law after playing the eponymous outlaw in Billy the Kid 1941. Taylor is cast as rugged lefthanded Army scout Ward Kinsman in this black  white MGM horse opera about the desperate search for a woman captured by the Apaches. Ambush is a stark looking oater with some good visual effects for its day. Scenarist Marguerite Roberts' adaptation of Luke Short's short story is frankly adult for its day. The primary plot concerns the Army's search for Mary Carlyle and the pursuit of a dangerous Apache chieftain Diablito Charles Stevens of The Black Pirate who took Mary hostage.The daring opening gambit finds Kinsman and another Army Scout Frank Holly John McIntire of Backlash trying to escape from a band of Apaches. They stampede their horses and hide among the rocks while the mounted warriors swarm in pursuit of their horses. The main party of braves vanishes into a narrow pass and our heroes challenge three warriors blow all of them off their horses and steal those horses. Our heroes not only escape with their scalps but also their lives. Wood does a good job of staging this fracas. The next day they arrive at the cavalry fort. The fort turns out to be a hotbed of adultery as an cruel enlisted man Tom Conovan Bruce Cowling of Battleground likes to beat his wife Martha Conovan Jean Hagen of The Asphalt Jungle while she has an affair with Lieutenant Linus Delaney Don Taylor of Stalag 17 who knows he is in trouble. Later Conovan assaults Fort Commandant Major C.E. Breverly Leon Ames of The Postman Always Rings Twice with a pitchfork and punctures his lungs. As a result Breverly turns over command of the fort to Captain Ben Lorrison John Hodiak of Lifeboat who has warned Delaney of his adulterous ways. Somehow Lorrison persuades Kinsman to scout for him as he sets out to capture Diablito and recover Mary Carlyle Marta Mitrovich. Lorrison recruits an Apache prisoner to help him find Diablito but Kinsman doesn't trust the brave. Predictably the treacherous brave sneaks out of Lorrison's camp to warn Diablito but Kinsman manages to kill him before he can alert the elusive Apache chieftain. Throughout this 89 minute western Ann Duverall Arlene Dahl of Land Raiders is stuck at the army post where Lorrison romances her and later suggests a proposal of marriage. Kinsman takes a similar interest in Ann but nothing happens between them. Tragically Lorrison dies during a clever Apache ambush which is no doubt the source of the film's title. The wily savages leave an obvious trail for Lorrison and his men to follow into the open flatlands and these sagacious brave bury themselves just beneath the surface of the earth so that the troopers enter this crescent of warriors who burst from the ground and mow them down. Delaney and his men ride to the rescue but they are too late to help Lorrison. The sneaky Diablito plays possum in the hope of catching Kinsman with his guard down but our hero drills him three times ultimately killing the chieftain.Ambush is no great shakes but it is an efficiently helmed oater with a strong cast and good performances.".

Although Hodiak is a good actor he wouldn't go on to anything significant except a premature death. He's probably most remembered for his part in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat' but that was in the early part of his career. You don't have that much time at the top.As for the film itself it's a bit pedestrian. It lacks a good script and storyline. The characters are onedimensional but the performances by both Taylor and Hodiak are good. The direction is not that good but if you haven't got a good script then there isn't much you can do.".

Loren is a rich heiress who for some reason has to marry again to satisfy conditions of her father's will and Sellers plays an altruistic Indian doctor in London where the movie is set with whom she has an uninteresting lovehate relationship. I found it all but impossible to keep my attention focused on the screen as the film worked its way toward its conclusion. It made for one of the longest 90minute movies I've ever seen.Part of the problem I think is that characters here are not developed they just burst out in full force the moment you see them making a viewer feel like he or she has started watching in the middle of the film. Also as a romance the movie is completely flat with zero chemistry between the leads. It's no wonder you don't hear much about this film from fans of Loren or Sellers or Shaw for that matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "You cannot hit the target perfectly every time and this is true of dramatist as the rest of us.George Bernard Shaw gave us MAJOR BARBARA PYGMALION ST. JOANHEARTBREAK HOUSE MAN AND SUPERMAN ... but he could do mediocre work. I think he had become a bit of an old fogy. His mind had gotten set into certain thought patterns that he would not give up. Whether this was due to disenchantment in the failure of the political Labor Party movement to improve England I can only leave to his biographers to fight out. He retreated into a fantasy world. It sometimes succeeds with flashes of his wit but for the most part he falls on his face. In this period Shaw demonstrated a remarkable belief in strongmen. He looked at those dynamic dictators abroad in Russia Italy and Germany and the result was GENEVA 1935 a play that is rarely considered for revival today  the audience might riot at it's apologia for Stalin Mussolini and Hitler. Shaw felt that one could not look at these men and their actions without seeing the total aim that they were pushing. The problem with Shaw's vision was he was buying their aims for efficiency and for better economic standards for the bulk of their peoples. Certainly they were dynamic but Shaw ignored huge political crimes. He had always favored the work of a great person who cut to the chase ignoring the damage left and right. Undershaft in MAJOR BARBARA was typical of this  he fights poverty by giving good wages and housing and health care to the people who work in his armaments plants. That he might encourage war is nonsense  Make war on war is how he sees it. Only in the Great War had Shaw questioned this. He created Boss Mangan in HEARTBREAK HOUSE who is really Undershaft up to date 1916. Undershaft had a ready selfcongratulatory statement and answer for everything. Mangan seems that way but his feet of clay are shown. He whines about his business policies that have helped lead to the present disaster to Britain. He can't undue them for fear of losing his Boss position due to his shareholder's anger. And in the end Mangan is killed by an enemy bomb ironically enough. It would take World War II to finally make Shaw realize how misplaced his faith in Great Men was. Notably he did not write that much after 1939.He showed he hope that private philanthropy by the wealthy might help. His plays keep suggesting solutions by the rich like BOUYANT BILLIONS. THE MILLIONAIRESS is a similar play. It actually can succeed as a comedy  Katherine Hepburn played Epifania successfully on stage. But it's point of view is hard to take.SPOILERS COMING UPEpifania has just become the richest woman in the world. She is seeking fulfillment in love. Her father whose painting looks like Peter Sellers in a beard has set the standard for whomever she will marry in the long run. It's hard to match. She asks for the assistance of the family lawyer Sagamore  Alistair Sim who introduces her around. Naturally the first person she dates seriously is that notorious fortune hunting scoundrel Dennis Price  but that relationship soon ends. Epifania decides to commit suicide. She approaches Sagamore and Sim without blinking an eye hands her the recipe for a fool proof instantaneous painless poison. Disgusted she goes to the Thames and throws herself in. And she meets Sellers playing Dr. Kabir from India.Sellers is as mother fixated as Loren is father fixated Seller's mother's picture looks like Loren. Loren falls for him but he seems more concerned about his indigent patients and his clinic. What follows is Loren's attempts to win Sellers first as a desperate patient then as a wouldbe financial angel. Nothing she does stimulates him he is rather surprised. Finally she does get him to agree to taking a test her father set up can Sellers make a fortune out of 500 pounds in three months and Sellers gives her a test his mother set up for the woman he was to marry can she live on 500 pounds for three months.We watch Loren go to work for small restaurant owner Victorio De Sica for three months  she ends up making it into a nightspot for the rich and De Sica admits that he thinks he will sell it and then find a side street to start a nice small family restaurant again. Sellers tries to get rid of the money as quickly as he can  he puts out a tray with the money on it and a sign saying Free Money. His patients thinks it's a joke and don't take it. Finally he manages to unload it on fellow physician Noel Purcell after a dinner they attend where they both get drunk. This is disappointing to Loren who decides that as Sellers has failed she will enter a convent one that she has funded. Sim not liking such a waste contacts Sellers that Loren is going to commit suicide. This finally rouses Sellers who shows up to prevent such a catastrophe.Sim actually gave the best performance of the three actors but I feel it is because his Mr. Sagamore was just reacting to the activities of the other two. He was like a breeze of fresh air in the film's actions. Also the work by Purcell and De Sica was quite good as small as both performances were. Loren and Sellers did well. There is some chemistry. Sellers read too much into this. Reputedly he thought Loren and he would become an item but Loren never saw it that way.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Millionairess reminds me of why people will sit through generally stale movies sometimes instead of just packing it in the odd glitter or chemistry between two major movie stars who one does not often get to see together.  This is a flat uncompelling piece of work about a newly minted heiress Sophia Loren who can't find the right man to marry and a devoted Indian physician Peter Sellers who has no interest in money or women.      Sellers performance is about the only thing that takes this picture above banality he has so much integrity as an actor that he raises the level of the mostly shoddy material. He has some truly wonderful charming moments as the doctor who resists the stunning Loren at every turn the same could not be said offcamera Sellers wrecked his first marriage over the obsession.  Loren is a good but not great actress her appeal lies heavily in her charm and good humor.  Here those qualities are muted by the character she plays a selfobsessed bombshell who has no real love to give only money and doesn't understand why a man of true integrity won't respond to that.  But what's wrong with the screenplay is fairly obvious.  In the typical Hate At First Sight movie romance the characters learn and grow to see the virtue of the each other's worth then fall in love.  Here they don't.  Sellers character gives no indication of wearing down Loren's never stops being exasperating in one scene she fakes an illness at 430 AM so Sellers will come over to examine her. When they hook up at the end it's totally implausible and not very satisfying she fakes committing suicide to draw him to her.      That said the movie is not quite boring the audience may be drawn to the radiance of the stars in spite of itself but it has no real spark and no drive.  The look of it is quite nice it's expensive without being gaudy. But it doesn't serve the actors very well even the great Alastair Sim isn't wellused.  I suspect watching The Millionairess is something like being superrich one gets the feeling of having too much time to kill.  2 out of 4".

The only saving grace for this incredibly annoying creature was her solicitor played by Alistair Simwhose indifference to her ridiculous behavior was at least enjoyable.After Loren proves unlucky in love she happens to run into an Indian doctor played by Peter Sellers. Unlike other men he is completely indifferent to her boorish misbehaviors or ample 'charms'. And since Loren is playing a spoiled screwball she falls for Sellers and does almost anything to get him. Frankly this is an interesting but utterly ridiculous ideaand certainly not enough of a basis for a movie as there is absolutely no chemistry between them and it didn't make sense. Sellers is pretty good and realistic in this role but it isn't comedic in the leastdespite the film being a comedy! In fact his Indian character from THE PARTY would have probably worked better with this sort of broad comedy.Overall a rather pointless waste of the talents of the actors. You'd think they could have done better. But actors cannot overcome bad writing and indifferent direction. Clearly a misfire.".

I can't imagine why they wanted to do it and I frankly don't know if their version would have been much better. At least in this production we got to look at Sophia and her exquisite wardrobe.Loren plays an Italian heiress who falls for an Indian doctor Sellars devoted to helping the poor. She is determined to get him even building a huge hospital for him but nothing seems to work. Her father stipulated that if she married she must give her husbandtobe 500 pounds and within three months he must have made it into 15000 pounds. It turns out that Sellars' mother had a similar rule for a proposed wife  she must go out into the world with 35 shillings and the clothes on her back and make a living. Loren takes the bet and hands Sellars 500 pounds. She walks into a pastamaking sweatshop cuts out the middleman brings in modern equipment lets the workers unionize and makes a fortune for the owners and herself. The Sellars character leaves the money he was given on his reception desk but no one takes any.There is absolutely no action and no pacing in this film and it fails to hold interest except when Sophia shows up in a new outfit. It's obvious that it's a play and it would have to move a lot faster in order for it to have even a chance at working. Sophia is definitely one of the wonders of the world and in 1960 she was on top of it an absolute goddess with a voluptuous body the kind never seen today. She's beautifully dressed by Pierre Balman. Sellars is excellent as always but this would be at the bottom of the list as far as his early films.Dull.".

In today's society in which sex is flaunted and perverted in the movies it's nice to be able to take a trip back in time and see movies in which sex was depicted more as an innuendo. Sophia Loren is one of the most beautiful women of alltime and Peter Sellers was one of the funniest comics of alltime.

	schema:reviewBody "I've never read the GBS play this is supposedly based on but I'm sure it had to be better than this movie adaptation. Shaw's influence is evident in the emphasis on class warfare and the evils of capitalists. But the silly plot in which these ideas are presented is tedious and slow moving.If you read a capsule summary of THE MILLIONAIRESS you get the impression that it's somehow about a contest between a man and a woman trying to fulfill the terms of various wills so they can be married. But the actual contest doesn't really come into focus until the movie is more than half over. Before that it just grinds its gears showing us how petulant and greedy Sophia Loren's character can be and how pure and honorable Peter Sellers' Indian doctor can be. Her interest in him doesn't make much sense and neither does his rejection of her advances. The abrupt ending leaves you wondering if a reel or two have been left out unintentionally. Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren looking so young and radiant are always fun to watch. Just imagine what a great comedy they COULD have made if a good screenwriter had developed a proper vehicle for them. Watching them work is the only thing that makes this movie bearable. Great comic actors like Alfie Bass and Alastair Sim are wasted in parts that barely allow them to stretch although we do get a couple of Sim's trademark giggles. Besides all this the film looks cheap. The sets are barebones some looking like painted backgrounds from a school play. The scene where they visit the new hospital and Sellers raves about the equipment is a joke in itself would he really be impressed by a couple of lab tables with a few test tubes and what looks like a Victorian microscope?This film is only for Sellers andor Loren fans who insist on seeing everything they ever did. Those who are seeking entertainment should look elsewhere.".

	schema:headline " About as funny as a twohour speech at a TUC conference";
	schema:reviewBody "The Millionairess loosely based on a play by George Bernard Shaw is a British romantic comedy about a romance between a wealthy Italian heiress and an Indian doctor. I cannot imagine the Hollywood of the early sixties making a romcom about that particular racial combination. The heroine is Epifania Parerga has inherited a vast fortune from her father the hero is Ahmed el Kabir who runs a clinic for the poor in London's East End. The main idea is that Epifania falls hopelessly in love with Kabir even though their values are diametrically opposed she is a ruthless capitalist he is an unworldly and idealistic socialist. When Shaw wrote his play in 1936 doctors who worked in the East End or other poor workingclass areas generally were selfsacrificing idealists but the film is set in the year it was made 1960 by which time the introduction of the National Health Service meant that this was no longer the case.To win Epifania Kabir has to satisfy the conditions of her eccentric father's will namely that he must turn 500 into 15000 within a threemonth period. As he has absolutely no business acumen whatever this seems a hopeless task. To win Kabir Epifania has to comply with an equally eccentric condition laid down by his mother she must prove that she can survive on only 35 shillings 1.75 in modern currency for three months. Rather surprisingly she proves to be more than equal to this task.The film was a great success both in Britain and internationally at the time of its release but today it is difficult to understand why. Today it comes across as horribly dated. Part of the reason is that Peter Sellers' characterisation of Kabir complete with brown makeup and singsong accent seems patronising almost borderline racist but there is more to it than that. At least the song Goodness Gracious Me was omitted from the film. Quite apart from the racial aspects this is not Sellers' greatest performance. He could be very good in parts where he had to adopt a foreign accent notably Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther series and Dr Strangelove in the film of that name but both Clouseau and Strangelove were in their very different ways inspired creations. Kabir is not. He is a wordy tedious bore of the sort that crops up in Shaw's drama from time to time less a rounded individual than a mouthpiece for a set of political opinions about as funny as a twohour speech at a TUC conference.Sophia Loren as Epifania is better and she puts a lot of zest and energy into her characterisation. For all his own leftwing views Shaw often couldn't help creating rightwing characters who were more interesting than his idealistic leftists Andrew Undershaft in Major Barbara being another example and with her zeal for capitalist enterprise Epifania comes across as a sexier more glamorous version of the young Margaret Thatcher. There is however little chemistry between Loren and Sellers. Legend has it that Sellers fell hopelessly in love with the beautiful Italian on the set of this movie but that she happily married to Carlo Ponti failed to return his affections. If the legend is true it would explain a lot.There are some decent performances in supporting roles from the likes of Alastair Sim Dennis Price and Alfie Bass but they do not compensate for the lack of interest generated by the central love story. Director Anthony Asquith had earlier directed a very good Shaw adaptation Pygmalion from 1938 but The Millionairess is not in the same class. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a better movie than I had expected. Peter Sellers did another uncannily dead on imitation of an accent to go with his many imitations of accents from England and America and he got to read some actual GBS lines which was nice. There was more language from the George Bernard Shaw play than I had expected. Dennis Price and Alistair Sim offer nice comic support. I just wish they could have used an actress less concerned with how she looked and more interested in the language of the play.There are obvious flaws in this film. For starters it suffers from extreme staginess. It's socialist message is not so much delivered but bludgeoned home. I give this film a pass because of the appealing performances by the film's leads Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren. Sellers gives a terrific lowkey turn as the sweet humanistic doctor. Loren is earthy yet manages to humanize the spoiled heiress she plays. As written her character comes of as unappealing but Loren manages to engender empathy. Good supporting cast that includes Alistair Sim as Loren's barrister Vittorio De Sica as a sweat shop owner and Dennis Price as Loren's psychiatrist. Great film great direction great actors and actresses Sofia Loren is amazingly beautiful and no wonder why Sellers fell in love with her!Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

Given the choice between a studio film and and independent one I will always choose the latter one. That said there are a lot of unanswered questions in the film.We have no inkling at the beginning of the film that Timmy is a sick boy he is suddenly in the hospital where a donor has been matched and will undergo a kidney transplant. The donor is Slovo a man who was hit by the boy's father and it's an obnoxious man. The quest for the search of this man who disappeared from the hospital is at the core of the action. It gives the writers an excuse for bringing the assorted characters into the picture.Another thing that doesn't make sense is how can anyone be arrested for attending a TA club? Evidently it can only happen in the city of Angels! There is the rapper with the gorgeous girlfriend who can't carry a tune who come to help the boy and his father and in the process take us into the streets of a seedy section of town and end up in the rapper's mansion where everyone jumps in the pool.There are a lot things that don't make sense but we go along the ride because the director at times shows signs of brilliant film making but ultimate the movie leaves us questioning a lot of things as to why they happen.The cast is wonderful. Daryl Mitchell and Rose Collins are perfect as the rapper and his girlfriend. Steve Buscemi and Peter Dinklage as the clowns don't get a lot to do. Pruitt Taylor Vince an actor's actor makes an incredible Owen the man who will eventually save the boy.

It features a huge eclectic ensemble cast in a wild series of events that are at first glance pretty farfetched.  But the result is surprisingly smooth and genuine.

In addition to Steve Buscemi and Jennifer Beals I recognized many of the actors from television and other mostly independent movies David Proval from The Sopranos Karyn Parsons from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air Daryl Mitchell and Sam Rockwell from GalaxyQuest and Peter Dinklage from Living in Oblivion. The plot doesn't exactly ramble but there are definitely points where it's unclear where the story is moving.  It's hard with so many interesting characters to maintain a perfect narrative balance.  But the great thing about 13 Moons is that it is a little offbalance.  It's basically a collection of strange little moments but they all feel so sincere that it's easy to lose yourself in them.  And in the end everything and everyone comes together.  In fact it's one of the most satisfying movie endings I've seen in a long time.

	schema:reviewBody "Thank the cinema gods that movies like this are still being made  personal inimitable expressive visions you'll never see in a studio boutique division's wildest dreams!Doing his best work since the very funny In The Soup Alexandre Rockwell again works with a large ensemble cast of fine but often underused actors to tell the niftily interwoven stories of an unlikely set of characters all of whose paths cross because of a marital spat and a lifeweary bailbondsman getting saddled with his waifish son  who's in desperate need of a kidney transplant.  Problem is it seems the only good match is sloshing about in the innards of the bedrugged drunken wackedout Peter Stormare in a Santa suit continuing Rockwell's ongoing leitmotiv in several films.  The movie beautifully shot on hidef video by the estimable Phil Parmet with an insinuating score all takes place in one night an extended but befuddled chase after the wayward reluctant kidney donor.Among an as entertaining group of actors as you're likely to find Daryl Mitchell Rose Rollins and Peter Dinklage are especially sharp and funny. Keep an ear peeled for Rollins's perfectly pitched horribly bad rap song!Lots of incidental pleasures along the way and typical in the Rockwellian oeuvre an uplifting moment at the end  literally and figuratively.  All in all a shaggydog delight.".

	onyx:emotionText "Thank the cinema gods that movies like this are still being made  personal inimitable expressive visions you'll never see in a studio boutique division's wildest dreams!Doing his best work since the very funny In The Soup Alexandre Rockwell again works with a large ensemble cast of fine but often underused actors to tell the niftily interwoven stories of an unlikely set of characters all of whose paths cross because of a marital spat and a lifeweary bailbondsman getting saddled with his waifish son  who's in desperate need of a kidney transplant.  Problem is it seems the only good match is sloshing about in the innards of the bedrugged drunken wackedout Peter Stormare in a Santa suit continuing Rockwell's ongoing leitmotiv in several films.  The movie beautifully shot on hidef video by the estimable Phil Parmet with an insinuating score all takes place in one night an extended but befuddled chase after the wayward reluctant kidney donor.Among an as entertaining group of actors as you're likely to find Daryl Mitchell Rose Rollins and Peter Dinklage are especially sharp and funny. Keep an ear peeled for Rollins's perfectly pitched horribly bad rap song!Lots of incidental pleasures along the way and typical in the Rockwellian oeuvre an uplifting moment at the end  literally and figuratively.  All in all a shaggydog delight.";

The dull grainy cinematography in combination with sad clowns performing poorly before a local TV station child audience was enough to make me think OK this is just weird.But even during those first few scenes I saw a dark humor typical of today's attitude towards the unfailing reality of life so given that I decided to watch on. What I witnessed was a film about one of those strange nights when the Moon is full the mystical powers are strong in the air and the lives of strangers will cross.The relationships of these strangers center around the Bail bondsman Mo David Proval but the events of the night surround his estranged son Timmy whose mother comes to the father in a babysitting emergency. Unbeknownst to the father his son has only one kidney that is barely functioning and he is waiting a beeper call from the hospital for a donor. While this is happening most of the other characters also need Mo for Bail at the very same time sort of a convergence of need all at one moment. After going to the Jailhouse to perform his duties the child wanders out in the parking lot and almost gets hit by a car. At this very moment the story changes from a group of quirky adults trying to solve their own problems to a group of adults realizing that all of their selfish desires are nothing compared to the needs of this child. From this point forward the scene changes are chaotic and bizarre in a Pulp Fiction type fashion but the message remains clear even while whining about their pathetic lives these adults keep their focus and do all that they can do to help the boy and find his Kidney donor who has wandered out of the hospital.There are defining moments that will remain with the boy the scene in the hospital the trip his father takes after hours to the zoo to see the monkeys and when everyone jumps into the pool giving the child a sense of joy you feel he has had yet to feel in his pitiful little life. There are several epiphanies amongst the cast of characters. One of my favorites is when the night watchman from the Zoo tells Mo shooting me with that gun isn't going to make you a better father. In the end the child is saved by the supreme sacrifice of the priest Owen who had been suffering from doubts about his priesthood and searching for the meaning of his life.This Movie has genuine moments of dark humor and a very meaningful and happy ending. If your looking for something a little different that doesn't leave you feeling haunted you will enjoy this movie.".

Despite having a cast that's speckled with all kinds of big names character actors and cameos it has the appearance of barest of bones indie digs and looks suspiciously like it was filmed bootlegguerrilla style. I've not a clue what the story behind it's conception is but it's a brilliant little flick that you won't find anywhere these days but deserves a look. It's one of those moody nocturnal L.A. set ensemble pieces in which a group of eclectic characters wander about intersecting in various subplots until it finally comes together in the third act. This motif is overdone these days and I just have to throw a jab at Paul Haggis's Crash which has aged like Kraft Dinner left for a week in the Florida sun but my point is that they either work or topple over like a jenga tower buckling under the weight of each character and scenario. This one is so low budget it looks like it was shot on an etch a sketch but thankfully the story is powerful emotional hilarious and strange enough to make a lasting impression. Steve Buscemi and Peter Dinklage are two sadsack clowns who wander the nightscape and in fact the image of absurdly out of place clowns roaming the lonely streets of NYC getting caught up in a raucous night out involving a man David Proval an underused talent in the industry and his young son who is dying of cancer and desperately seeks an organ donor while his mom Jennifer Beals looks for them. Meanwhile there's an insane clown played by Peter Stormare who's running about and when I say insane I do mean it. Stormare is always a little zany and flamboyant but his work here takes the cake and whips it at the wall. It's easy for actors to be uninhibited in indie fare like this free from the prudence of studio chaperones and he knows this his character eventually playing a key role but most of the time careening around like a bat out of hell set loose in New York. The cameos are fleeting and fascinating and one wonders who was buddies with who and pulled what favours to swing their appearances but it's nice to see them irregardless. Sam Rockwell and Michael Parks are fun as two bartenders real life exhoodlums Danny Trejo and Edward Bunker show up briefly as.. hoodlums and watch for quick turns from Pruitt Taylor Vince Michael Badalucco and others. The film is thoroughly indie that no one has or probably will ever see it and my review probably adds to the scant half dozen or so write ups that are out there. Sadly many little treasures like this exist unbeknownst to most. 13 Moons is a sweet scrappy somewhat star studded little piece that is well worth anyone's time if they love a good story in an oddball of a package.".

Its just one of those must sees I think. The basic premise is that a little boy needs a new kidney. A cousin of his happens to be in the hospital but said cousin is a drunken santa dude who escapes and tries to have one last night of mayhem. Strangers become involved in his pursuit including a clown who has lost his humor a priest who has lost his god a stripper a rapper a mother to be who isn't anymore a midget and others. The cinematography was very different kind of like American beauty. bottom line this movie gave me hope.".

Its just one of those must sees I think. The basic premise is that a little boy needs a new kidney. A cousin of his happens to be in the hospital but said cousin is a drunken santa dude who escapes and tries to have one last night of mayhem. Strangers become involved in his pursuit including a clown who has lost his humor a priest who has lost his god a stripper a rapper a mother to be who isn't anymore a midget and others. The cinematography was very different kind of like American beauty. bottom line this movie gave me hope.";

	schema:reviewBody "To me it's pretty obvious what this movie tries to attempt. It tries to put together many different story lines featuring different characters that all come together pretty fast into the movie. A storytelling technique that later got much better used and done by for instance director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu.The movie is basically being presented as one big adventure movie in which a whole bunch of characters go on a quest to safe a little boy's life. Only thing is this 'adventure' is done as a drama. It has a s serious story which just doesn't connect to well with the movie its quirky characters and all of the unlikely events happening in this movie. The way all of these characters get thrown together in this movie is pretty weak. Basically they have absolutely nothing to do with each other but still for some odd reason they all stay together throughout the entire movie. At times the movie desperately tries to connect all of their stories together and weave them in with each other but it's all really thin. Everything that seems to happen in this movie seems as a coincidence and the movie is really hanging together from its coincidences.And the characters aren't much good either really despite the fact that they are being played by some well known actors. So they basically all have their issues but you just never get to care enough about any of the characters to to care or to feel attached to any of them. Their problems also aren't too 'deep' and the way everything gets resolved is again also hanging together from its coincidences and comes across as some lazy writing. It's almost as if its writing and its directing don't connect at all with each other as if the director had a totally different movie in mind than the writer had which is strange considering that both were the same person.For most part I still liked watching this movie but toward the end things really got worse when the movie seemed to run out of ideas and everything just became less and less interesting and more and more of a pointless dragging movie that was heading towards an ending that wasn't much satisfying either. Once you start thinking about this movie nothing gets really explained or resolved so watching this movie is a very unsatisfying experience.Still the entire idea behind this movie must have been good not in the least because all of these great actors seemingly showed up for free to appear in this movie. Because it just didn't seemed as if this movie had an actual budget to work with. It's also a really cheap looking movie that has a sort of TV look or as if it got done by a couple of friends shooting a movie in their weekends.You could say that the movie still have plenty of redeeming qualities that still keep the movie somewhat watchable such as its acting for instance but overall in the end this is a very unrewarding movie that is literally hanging together from its coincidences and some highly unlikely events which all comes across as some weak and lazy writing.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is definitely unusual but it doesn't seem to believe in itself or in the worth of its story so by the end it falls flat and can only really be evaluated as a farce. We start out with Steve Buscemi and Peter Dinklage as a couple of clowns struggling through their jobs on some cableaccess kids' show. Eventually we are introduced to a number of other characters whose lives all intersect over the course of one night a la Magnolia Short Cuts Crash. Buscemi is always a solid character actor but here he seems somewhat confused about his motivation and I can't really blame him. Rockwell is known as a very handsoff director and I have to say that this movie seems to have just derailed on him despite some touching visual concepts and decent potentially explosive backstories. The scene in the swimming pool in which a priest who is going through a crisis of faith teams with Steve Buscemi to teach a sickly young boy how to swim is just so overstuffed with tropes as to completely destroy the viewer's attentiveness to any throughline or narrative thrust. The subplots are all individually interesting and are handled with at least a fair amount of investment and decent performance by nearly everyone involved. But they only intersect in odd ways that seem to desire to make some sort of larger statement but only end up in chaos and perhaps a vague statement about everyone coming together to help solve their shared problems. But really it seems that Rockwell's strength is in showing people who are insane or in the absolute gutter and so any kind of humanist impulse that he has is only articulated vaguely and without enough buildup to be moving. That being said there are a number of intriguing minor characters in the film and as I've mentioned it is filled with acting talent. It's almost like this is a movie where you want to extract assorted moments and enjoy them as if they were short films so that you don't have to cringe painfully at their inability to flow in the overall storyline. The brief moment where Ernie Lee Banks as a zoo's night watchman argues honestly with the bail bondsman and his son is touching almost like something out of Magnolia. The character played by David Proval is taken almost directly out of the bail bondsman character in Jackie Brown a film by Rockwell's friend Quentin Tarantino. That being said Proval does a decent job with the muddled and cutrate character he is assigned by the screenplay.I tried hard to like this movie but in the end it is so riddled with headscratching loopholes and mistakes and poor transitions that I could only call it gutsy at best. I wouldn't call it great and not even good. Rockwell's use of handheld video cameras didn't bother me and if anything it was visually interesting. I guess the ending of this movie without giving it entirely away made me wonder if Rockwell was merely trying to make up for the dark comic sense or atmosphere of decay that permeates the rising action of the film. In any case it just does not seem to flow and it does not fit organically with the rest of the bizarre story.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was told it was one of those either you love it or you hate it movies. Well I loved it. Obvious hippieera dated and easy symbolism and all. So I probably have no taste at all when it comes to Antonioni but this and La Notte made exactly a decade earlier are my favourites among his movies so far. Made two years before I was born Zabriskie Point was supposed to have been Michelangelo's great American epic. But apparently it turned out to be a flop. I really can't see why. Before watching it I'd read that it was rather boring so I braced myself for a very slow movie  though I love me a slow movie. For my taste Zabriskie didn't have a tedious minute in it. While watching it I made a mental note of how European it was on the director's part to make such frequent use of advertisement billboards in almost every urban scene enormous billboards dwarfing any human form in sight. This recurrent visual element is obviously there to underline the way that consumerism crushes the individual in American society. But then I watched L'Eclisse straight afterwards which is set in Rome in the early 60s and noticed that Antonioni often included billboards in it as well. After all the masterful use of landscapes architecture and inanimate objects in each frame with or without human beings is an Antonioni trademark  this is precisely the way that he evokes his characters' psychological states with more or less understated power and great visual impact. He is virtually unsurpassed in this skill.Zabriskie Point starred two very appealing leads that should have become big stars of the 70s but never did. Mark Frechette whom I'd already seen in Francesco Rosi's fine WWIset movie Uomini Contro had a very tragic life and died aged just 27. According to his biography page he donated his 60000 earnings from Zabriskie to a commune. Mark's costar Daria Halprin apparently also Dennis Hopper's wife later on has the stunning natural beauty and appeal of a young Ornella Muti  one of those luminous beauties that don't need a shred of makeup to turn heads. Like Frechette she has only graced a couple of obscure movies and has never become a star but at least she didn't die tragically. Most notably Zabriskie Point contains one of the most original sex scenes ever filmed  one that brings home a sense of youthful playfulness like few I've seen  as well as a powerfully cathartic ending. It may be the most banal sequence ever filmed as far as its symbolism goes but I can't see how anyone can deny its beauty and wonderful sense of emotional release. Never has an explosion looked so good and so poetic. It seems to be an explosion that restores order rather than bringing chaos.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was told it was one of those either you love it or you hate it movies. Well I loved it. Obvious hippieera dated and easy symbolism and all. So I probably have no taste at all when it comes to Antonioni but this and La Notte made exactly a decade earlier are my favourites among his movies so far. Made two years before I was born Zabriskie Point was supposed to have been Michelangelo's great American epic. But apparently it turned out to be a flop. I really can't see why. Before watching it I'd read that it was rather boring so I braced myself for a very slow movie  though I love me a slow movie. For my taste Zabriskie didn't have a tedious minute in it. While watching it I made a mental note of how European it was on the director's part to make such frequent use of advertisement billboards in almost every urban scene enormous billboards dwarfing any human form in sight. This recurrent visual element is obviously there to underline the way that consumerism crushes the individual in American society. But then I watched L'Eclisse straight afterwards which is set in Rome in the early 60s and noticed that Antonioni often included billboards in it as well. After all the masterful use of landscapes architecture and inanimate objects in each frame with or without human beings is an Antonioni trademark  this is precisely the way that he evokes his characters' psychological states with more or less understated power and great visual impact. He is virtually unsurpassed in this skill.Zabriskie Point starred two very appealing leads that should have become big stars of the 70s but never did. Mark Frechette whom I'd already seen in Francesco Rosi's fine WWIset movie Uomini Contro had a very tragic life and died aged just 27. According to his biography page he donated his 60000 earnings from Zabriskie to a commune. Mark's costar Daria Halprin apparently also Dennis Hopper's wife later on has the stunning natural beauty and appeal of a young Ornella Muti  one of those luminous beauties that don't need a shred of makeup to turn heads. Like Frechette she has only graced a couple of obscure movies and has never become a star but at least she didn't die tragically.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the film in Antonioni's middle period that most critics dismiss quickly as a 'flawed' look at 60s American youth culturepolitics. For what it's worth I found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like L'AVVENTURA perhaps because he shows more emotion  empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple but it is used as a frame for Antonioni's brilliant observations of and critique on American consumerist culture student life the counterculture and the whole antiestablishment antiwar backlash that was so prominent then. Even from a purely technical point of view it is a remarkably crafted film from the opening credits sequence to the bizarre desert 'lovein' to the use of billboards and right down to that jawdropping cathartic finale that used 17 camera setups in it's own way as powerful as the climax of The Wild Bunch. Also Antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with Daria Halperin one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen. There isn't much 'acting' involved as this feels more like a docudrama and so the use of non professionals as the lead couple works quite effectively within that context. And the soundtrack is not only filled with marvelous music its use is impressive as well I can't forget the start of the film mostly due to the selection of music  by Pink Floyd  that grooms the visuals so well.Contrary to popular opinion this is quite an achievement in cinema and one I would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off beat. Well worth seeking out and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a DVD restorationrelease.".

Cinematheque Director John Ewing who does a superlative job of obtaining the finest prints for his series shared with the audience beforehand that this print was specially flown over from Italy for this one showing only.The audience was held spellbound as the film unfolded its artisty on the huge panoramic screen.  Watching this superb print shown the way Antonioni intended made one aware that this is indeed a modern art work.  It was all the more fitting that the series is housed in the Cleveland Insititue of Art in University Circle.  Antonioni's compositions are created for the Cinemascope landscape.  His beautiful balancing of images striking use of colors sweeping choreographic movements all are the work of a genuine artist using the screen as his canvas. At last the audience could understand Zabriskie Point.  As its narrative unfolded it became obvious that this work is not about story per se but rather an artist's impressionistic rendering of fleeting images of his subject.  The setting of some of the more turbulent activities of the sixties provides only a dramatic motor for the artist's sweeping collage. Antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards and can pause at any point to creatively embroider an event with grandiose embellishments. The audience willingly went with the flow of his remarkable imagination as his huge images on the massive canvas held one in rapt attention.  While the audience may have been only tangentially involved in character relationships it  realized the theme here is human aleination the director's recurring theme. It was also realized that no print any smaller or of lesser quality than this original one in Cinemascope can do justice to this particular rendering.  The audience was therefore all the more appreciative of viewing Zabriskie Point in its original breathtaking format and broke into thunderous applause at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know that this is an unpopular position concerning Zabriskie Point but I LOVED this film. I know I know  I can legitimately be called an Antonioni fanatic. I love L'Avventura I love La Notte I love L'Eclisse I love Red Desert I love Blowup and I love Professione Reporter aka The Passenger. The only Antonioni film that I don't love the only one I've ever given less than an 810 and one of only three that I have given less than a 1010 La Notte and L'Eclisse being the other two though I fully acknowledge that I have to see both of them again is Beyond the Clouds which can fairly be called an awful film. However there is not better awful film if you catch my drift. So if you're NOT an Antonioni fan you should only logically ignore me. If you are even a casual fan though and you are wondering whether this particular film whose name when spoken is often followed bya spit which is generally despised by even Antonioni's admirers is at all worth seeing the answer is YES.Okay the reason that people tend to hate it is because 99 of film watchers care ONLY for the narrative of a film. Well that's not exactly true. If a film is amazing in a particular aspect say acting or cinematography or direction and just decent in its narrative film watchers might very well love it. But a film can be the most amazing visual masterpiece and have a lame or illogical story  that's another thing that has ruined the cinema over the years logic  then they absolutely hate the film. I will actually agree with that in some ways. As much as I may dislike it and want to change my view it really is difficult to love a film whose narrative I perceive as poor. However other people tend to get annoyed at a loose narrative. This is certainly what must drive viewers away from Zabriskie Point. I could relate the story to you but you probably would just think it was nonsensical. It is actually but to me that just made the whole endeavor more fantastic and beautiful. I'd actually compare it favorably to 2001 which is my favorite film. However 2001 is perfectly coherent compared to the rambling narrative of this film.What Zabriskie Point has in spades is mood. The music helps a lot the score includes a lot of acts of the day including Pink Floyd. The mood is kind of similar to the moods of Antonioni's other masterpieces filled with loneliness and desolation. Also the freedom that comes from that. The best sequence in the film is when the lead man and woman her name is Daria I know but I don't remember his name pull over in their vehicle next to a historic marker on a desert highway. There is beyond the stone wall that has been erected to keep cars from flying off an ancient lakebed. It's basically a rocky desert and the two go to play in it. The setting is enormously beautiful. The woman says This is such a beautiful place. What do you think? The man I think it's dead. There's no inclination to whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. This is a lot like sentiments expressed in other Antonioni films  characters are constantly wanting to disappear or become invisible. Instead of David Locke the protagonist of The Passenger fed up with journalism we have the young hippie sick of his friends' politics  he thinks they talk too much and don't act out what they feel is right or at least he says he does. It seems to me more like he just wanted out of the situation.The film is also simply amazing visually. Antonioni's films are all identifiable by just a few frames but his visual style was always building. I like The Passenger more than I do Zabriskie Point but Zabriskie Point might be his ultimate accomplishment in that aspect. Well that might sound odd  L'Avventura and Red Desert are amazing pictorially. I think it's the camera movements that are particularly amazing here. He obviously made a ton of money on Blowup which was the biggest arthouse hit of its day the biggest ever at that point. He spends it well here especially with his aerial shots. One of the film's greatest sequences involves the man who has stolen a man's private airplane divebombing Daria in her car.The one thing that can be fairly criticized is the film's politics. They're certainly facile. Not that hippies were facile but that Antonioni's vision of hippies  there weren't any in Italy of course  are bizarre and well filtered through a foreigner's eyes. There's a rather childish criticism of advertising but it's a criticism that still exists today. I say can't you people just ignore it? What does it hurt? Are you walking around buying things you don't want because of billboards? Or there is also the criticism against capitalism. Daria a secretary works for a company that is stealing the land in the desert  the land that she and the man enjoyed to themselves  in order to make cheap suburban homes for families. Rod Taylor a very underrated actor whose most famous roles were in The Time Machine and The Birds plays her boss. The ending which I won't ruin  you've got to see it  is almost offensively cheap. I can though understand the treatment of police officers. Not that I disdain them generally but they were awful at the time. They can still be awful now. They've always had too much power.These trite arguments against the American way of life still don't effect my opinion of the film much. I find this filtered view of America extremely interesting. I really don't think a hippie would have disagreed with Antonioni. 1010.".

	schema:headline " An Italian in California a technical masterpiece with subpar substance";
	schema:reviewBody "There aren't too many times when I see a film and go huh what? but this was one of them. Maybe after seeing Zabriskie Point I felt much the same way Woody Allen felt after seeing 2001 he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on. Michelangelo Antonioni in one of his few tries at making films inside of the US after Red Desert he did BlowUp this film China and The Passenger all filmed outside his native Italy I could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium. The results show that he doesn't lack the means to present images feelings tones colors sounds and a visual representation of this era. A director's job is to see Antonioni once stated. Whatever that means he doesn't disappoint for the admirer of his postfifties work I say postfifties since I've yet to see any of his films from before L'Avventura.What he does lack is a point at least the kind of point that he could bring in BlowUp and The Eclipse. You get the feeling of what is around these characters what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness however in this case the characters and the actors don't bring much conviction or purpose. Antonioni coming from the school of hardknocks neorealistic filmmaking does do what he can with his mostly nonprofessional cast those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters but the two stars Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin seem as if Antonioni's underdirecting them. Perhaps that was the point. The story's split into three acts thankfully not too confusing as Mark escapes his existence around the boiling dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60's LA area and Daria is sent out from LA to drive to Phoenix for some business meeting. They meet by chance as Mark's plane how does he know how to drive maybe a little background info there? and Daria's car meet up and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert. Aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene much of this act isn't terribly interesting. The two leads are fair enough to look at but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity? The ideas that come forth in part from a screenplay cowritten by Sam Shepard aren't too revealing except for one brief instant where drugs vs. reality is brought up. Then the film heads towards the third act as Mark decides to do the right thing under disastrous circumstances and Daria arrives at her boss' place only to be in full disillusionment not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film. Although the film took its time telling its story I didn't have as much of a problem with that as I did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer. I understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the selfconfidence of the antiestablishment but maybe Antonioni isn't entirely fully aware of it himself. In some scenes he as director and editor and the often astounding cinematography by Alfio Contini find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground. Not to say the technical side of Zabriskie Point isn't involving to a degree this may make some feel drowsy as Antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say Francis Ford Coppola is. The deserts skies city and even the faces in closeups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame bringing us in. The soundtrack is equally compelling with a master stroke including a sweet Rolling Stones song at one point and then a crushing surreal Pink Floyd song retitled from 'Careful with that Axe Eugene one of their best preDark Side in the explosion sequence. If only the performances weren't so onesided I might find this to be on par with BlowUp or The Eclipse. It's an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand and on the other a boring take on what was the hippieradical movement of the late 60's. But hey what may be boring for an American such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the US such as say Italy. And it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing.".

Michelangelo Antonioni in one of his few tries at making films inside of the US after Red Desert he did BlowUp this film China and The Passenger all filmed outside his native Italy I could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own mastery of the medium. The results show that he doesn't lack the means to present images feelings tones colors sounds and a visual representation of this era. A director's job is to see Antonioni once stated. Whatever that means he doesn't disappoint for the admirer of his postfifties work I say postfifties since I've yet to see any of his films from before L'Avventura.What he does lack is a point at least the kind of point that he could bring in BlowUp and The Eclipse. You get the feeling of what is around these characters what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness however in this case the characters and the actors don't bring much conviction or purpose. Antonioni coming from the school of hardknocks neorealistic filmmaking does do what he can with his mostly nonprofessional cast those who look most like real actors are subjugated to the roles of the corporate characters but the two stars Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin seem as if Antonioni's underdirecting them. Perhaps that was the point. The story's split into three acts thankfully not too confusing as Mark escapes his existence around the boiling dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60's LA area and Daria is sent out from LA to drive to Phoenix for some business meeting. They meet by chance as Mark's plane how does he know how to drive maybe a little background info there? and Daria's car meet up and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert. Aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene much of this act isn't terribly interesting. The two leads are fair enough to look at but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity? The ideas that come forth in part from a screenplay cowritten by Sam Shepard aren't too revealing except for one brief instant where drugs vs. reality is brought up. Then the film heads towards the third act as Mark decides to do the right thing under disastrous circumstances and Daria arrives at her boss' place only to be in full disillusionment not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film. Although the film took its time telling its story I didn't have as much of a problem with that as I did that the story only engages a certain kind of viewer. I understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the selfconfidence of the antiestablishment but maybe Antonioni isn't entirely fully aware of it himself. In some scenes he as director and editor and the often astounding cinematography by Alfio Contini find the scenery and backgrounds more enlightening and fixating than the people in the foreground. Not to say the technical side of Zabriskie Point isn't involving to a degree this may make some feel drowsy as Antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say Francis Ford Coppola is. The deserts skies city and even the faces in closeups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame bringing us in. The soundtrack is equally compelling with a master stroke including a sweet Rolling Stones song at one point and then a crushing surreal Pink Floyd song retitled from 'Careful with that Axe Eugene one of their best preDark Side in the explosion sequence. If only the performances weren't so onesided I might find this to be on par with BlowUp or The Eclipse. It's an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand and on the other a boring take on what was the hippieradical movement of the late 60's. But hey what may be boring for an American such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the US such as say Italy. And it does ask to not be discarded right away after one viewing.";

	schema:reviewBody "When this film was made the hippie thing had gone mainstream. The ideas of the counter culture was well established that is why such a big film could be made. Yet it has something to say and it is said really beautifully. Apart from those who're only waiting for the wanking material this film is given credit for its beautiful sceneswhich in itself is more than enough reason to see the film by the most. The soundtrack to this film which actually became more popular than the film itself is another plus. Pink Floyd's Careful with that axe Eugene suits really well with the explosions the absence of music in other scenes gives the film a nice quiet mood. But. It seems as though the messages in this film have been overlooked by the most. If you didn't understand it which seems to be the case for the most I'll give you some hints The mantough guy what ever his name isMark? is a part of a reality group. He leaves this group saying something like I'm willing to die. But not of boredom He later go for a joyride with a stolen plane probably to seek some action. As he is in the air Grateful Dead's Dark Starfrom the LiveDead album is playedi think. This song contains the phrase Shall we go you and I while we can this is though not heard in the film.Perhaps stretching it a bit too far meaning that quote is essential? In the plane he checks up a girlDaria who is driving in her car to a conferenceabout giving typical suburban families the opportunity to live in a superrelaxing place in the desert where everything is so simple and nice. For the whole family! by diving down almost hitting the car. He lands the plane and joins the girl on her way to Detroit. They stop at Zabriskie point where they enjoy each other as living creatures and the nature. Later a family with a big carof the type which you sleep in and a speed boat is showed visiting Zabriskie Point the father saying something like what a waste driving all the way up here and the kid sitting inside the car grinning. I sensed a this wasn't much better than on the tellyattitude. Daria takes Mark back to the plane which now is painted in a psychedelic style with the identity number changed to no war on one side and no words on the other. Bucks Sucks is also written on the plane. Mark takes the plane back to where he stole it from saying to Daria before he leaves I don't risk anything or something one of several hints about he not caring too much about his destiny. This because he has the feeling that the environment that surrounds don't give him anything I wonder what happens in the real world On the airport he is met by police officers who shoots him even though he just has returned the plane. Daria hears this on the radio but decides to go to the conference in the fancy mansion. Here she feels alien after the adventures with her just killed friend. She enjoys fresh water running down a rock more than the swimming pool. Inside the house the viewer is once again given a hint about antimaterialism She looks out through a glass wall holding her hands on the glass like she was trapped. The business men is seen arguing the one side eager to make a big deal the other afraid of losing money. Daria leaves the house and looks back at it visualizing it blowing up. After the house several other things blow up for example a television. She smiles happy she has inside herself destroyed what she after the meeting with Mark look upon as something negative.To summarize Mark obviously experience the reality group as not very useful as they just sit and talk taking no action. He clearly has bad feelings about things being as they are and it seems like he feels that it's no use fighting against it. He wants to leave. He helps Daria who is in mind but not in action seeing his point of view. Where his feeling of being misfitted turns out leading to his death one can hope Daria uses the ideas in a way that will turn out more constructive. In the film you see how a town LA is being polluted by commercial too bad you have to show the commercial to make the point you see business men deciding what is the future et cetera and you see people being unhappy with these and other situations which is parts of the modern world.I have only seen the film once so I have not caught all points but I certainly got a feeling of what this film has to say and I find it strange that this film can be called meaningless. If you say the points are being too obvious I can see why this film probably intended to appeal to the posthippie radicals digging the thoughts of antiestablishment. Even though it has a lot to say and its message is still needed today things pretty much evolving in the same direction as it did before the sixties. Zabriskie Point is a really great film telling a story about quite normal young people not far out hippies tripping around tip toe on acid digging everything seeking what they percept as real dissatisfied with the conventional. And it is done in a truly beautiful way.".

Having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them.This is not a scriptdriven film. Except for the first ten minutes it is mostly visual with stunning cinematography. The beautiful naturalistic images seem otherworldly and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of Mark and Daria.I would have replaced the thematically weak Pink Floyd music with the more cogent music of The Doors. Many scenes cry out for Riders On The Storm.Even so I like this film. It's different it's unique it is artistic and imaginative. And the desert badlands are beautiful.As the years go by Zabriskie Point seems more and more attractive. It conveys the mood of the late 1960's in America. It is amazingly artistic in a bohemian sort of way. And the film's last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing.".

In this case he tried to meld a very artsy style film with an antiestablishment hippie film and only succeeded in producing a bomb of gargantuan proportions.The film begins with a rap session where a lot of with it students sit around saying such platitudes as power to the people and complaining about the man. Considering most of these hippies have parents sending them to college it seemed a bit silly for these privileged kids to be complaining so loudly and shouting revolutionary jargon. A bit later violence between the students and the establishment pigs breaks out and a cop is killed. Our hero Mark may or may not have done it but he is forced to run to avoid prosecution. Instead of heading to Mexico or Canada he does what only a total moron would dosteals an airplane and flies it to the Mojave Desert! There he meets a happen' chick and they then sit around philosophizing for hours. Then they have sex in one of the weirder sex scenes in cinema history. As they gyrate about in the dust suddenly other couples appear from no where and there is a huge orgy scene. While you see a bit of skin warranting an Rrating it's not as explicit as it could have been. In fact it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just boggles the mind. And of course when they are finished the many many other couples vanish into thin air.Oddly later the couple paint the plane with some help and it looks a lot like a Peter Max creation. Despite improving the look of the plane the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary. When the girl finds out she goes into a semicatatonic state and the movie ends with her seemingly imagining the destruction of her own fascist pig parents and all the evil that they stand for such as hard work and responsibility. Instead of one simple explosion you see the same enormous house explode about 8 times. Then inexplicably you see TVs refrigerators and other things explode in slow motion. While dumb it is rather cool to watchsort of like when David Letterman blows things up or smashes things on his show.Aside from a dopey plot the film suffers from a strong need for a single likable character as well as extensive editing. At least 15 minutes could easily be removed to speed things up a bitespecially since there really isn't all that much plot or dialog. The bottom line is that this is an incredibly dumb film and I was not surprised to see it listed in The Fifty Worst Films book by Harry Medved. It's a well deserved addition to this pantheon of crap. For such a famed director to spend so much money to produce such a craptastic film is a crime!Two final observations. If you like laughing at silly hippie movies also try watching THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK. Also in a case of art imitating life the lead Mark Frechette acted out his character in real life. He died at age 27 in prison a few years after participating in an act of revolution in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent person. Dang hippies!!".

	schema:headline " A hippie's pretentious odyssey through decadent capitalist America.";
	schema:reviewBody "Antonioni by making this film had assumed the role of Papa Smurf to all the little longhaired American radical studentSmurfs. He had taken them under the guiding protection of his European communist wings showing appreciation and support for their confused American ways. These Smurfs are red and wear blue not the other way around. The radical Smurfs were happy to get the guidance of a wise old man with gray hair who regularly preys to the God of all longhaired Smurfs Lenin the Communist  another wise old man whose beard made the Smurfs take him even more seriously for it symbolized something wise though they did not quite know why they regarded the beard to have this kind of deep effect on them. Castro another wise bearded man has often profited from this confusion and exuded magical powers with his beard over his naive overseas admirers. Not to mention Che Guevara that beard has a certain jenesaispasquoi about it makes one want to immediately embrace Marx and his lovely pacifistic teachings The film starts with a muddled meeting of radically stupid radical students who engage in dialogues that truly redefine the word confused.

And this is what we get from an old saturated filthyrich fat filmmaker who lives in villas and dines in the best French and Italian restaurants.I don't remember seeing any major Western movie about the Tiananmen massacre of thousands of students in China. But when one Western student gets shot for waving Che Guevara's face into all our faces we get ten major films about it at once.

	onyx:emotionText "Antonioni by making this film had assumed the role of Papa Smurf to all the little longhaired American radical studentSmurfs. He had taken them under the guiding protection of his European communist wings showing appreciation and support for their confused American ways. These Smurfs are red and wear blue not the other way around. The radical Smurfs were happy to get the guidance of a wise old man with gray hair who regularly preys to the God of all longhaired Smurfs Lenin the Communist  another wise old man whose beard made the Smurfs take him even more seriously for it symbolized something wise though they did not quite know why they regarded the beard to have this kind of deep effect on them. Castro another wise bearded man has often profited from this confusion and exuded magical powers with his beard over his naive overseas admirers. Not to mention Che Guevara that beard has a certain jenesaispasquoi about it makes one want to immediately embrace Marx and his lovely pacifistic teachings The film starts with a muddled meeting of radically stupid radical students who engage in dialogues that truly redefine the word confused.

Good Luck to me!But time marches on and time has been kind to ZP and time has been a teacher to me. I revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age. And ZP is it's own experienceand is only really linked to BLOWUP through its creator the lategreat Mr. Antonioni.Twelve years ago I had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print projected at its correct size immense restored by an Italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape. To this day I remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand volt visual shock Antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness. And indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of place.What is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own.I remember the second time around seeing it  the early 80s  I had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular. Whereas before these two seemed like a smartalecky shadow version of Zefferelli's Olivia and Leonard read Romeo and Julietthey now were engaging me  particularly The Girl in her insistent slomotionality.

	schema:reviewBody "Before having seen this I had seen six other Antonioni movies The Passenger being my favorite. Each of the six had some merit so I was unprepared for this unfortunate effort.The movie starts off well enough with a fictionalized account of a student protest. I was a young man at the time of the student protests against the establishment in the late 1960s and I think the specific account presented here is not far from some actual events at the time. From a distance of forty years hence it might seem that the group discussion that opens the film among young activists arguing about tactics and what makes one a true revolutionary is farfetched but such meetings were not uncommon. I remember people I knew at the time would talk about when the revolution comes rather than if the revolution comes without any consideration of the fact that there wasn't going to be a revolution at least not one in the style that they perceived.Once the main character Mark gets fed up with what he is seeing and hearing and takes off on a personal odyssey the movie leaves the realm of reality. There are too many plot holes to enumerate. Could Mark sneak onto an airport in broad daylight appropriate a single engine plane with the keys in it no less and take off on his journey? And he tuns out to be a stunt pilot too? I think it can be stipulated that the movie is not concerned about appealing to the logically inclined which does not necessarily make it a bad movie but there is little to appeal to any frame of mind I think. The two lead actors are embarrassingly bad even for nonprofessionals and Rod Taylor gives his usual wooden performance. Maybe director Antonioni chose the unknown Mark Frechette to play the role of Mark since he has some physical and personality traits similar to Peter Fonda and Antonioni envisioned himself making his own Easy Rider. I suppose the audience is being encouraged to identify with the free spirited and spontaneous Mark as opposed to the crass materialistic oppressive society that is presented but the two extremes are drawn in such a heavyhanded manner that I felt bludgeoned by the message. Then there is the dialog that is so flat that I can't remember a single line. Apparently Sam Shepard shares some of the blame for that. There are some nude sex scenes which I guess are tossed in as a sop to the free love movement that was advanced by the counterculture of the 1960s. The scenes of young people rolling around in the desert having sex just felt odd to me. I think maybe Antonioni realized he was making a dog of a movie and some soft core porn might help at the box office. Or maybe in late middleage this is how Antonioni contrived to be around some naked youngsters.The only positive in this for me was the beautiful cinematography of the Death Valley California landscapes. At least Antonioni's talent for the use of color is in evidence in the landscape scenes as well as in the final explosion shots. I would have better appreciated Antonioni's making a travelogue than this thing.A good part of this movie takes place in Death Valley which contains the lowest point in the United States. This is fitting since I think this movie must also mark the lowest point in Antonioni's career.For a good understanding of the major themes of the 1960s in the United States see the documentary Berkeley in the Sixties.".

	schema:headline " Damn you 'bourgeois individualism'!";
	schema:reviewBody "In Blow Up 1966 Antonioni had his hero question truth against a backdrop of British youth protesters. By setting such questions against a fabric of hippie youth movements Antonioni questioned intentionally or not the effectiveness of these organisations. How can one fight for a cause when what one holds as true might be a lie? On the flip side the film said that we must always actively test what we see precisely because we live in an image bank of deceit at worst uncertainty at best. Though the hippie aspects were the most tacky parts of Blow Up they created a nice texture and gave the film more ambiguity  a sort of widespread ontological uncertainty  than it might otherwise have had. With Zabriskie Point however Antonioni throws away all the ambiguities and subtleties of Blow Up and instead goes full blown hippie. The result is a film awash with clunky metaphors and heavy handed storytelling  disappointing from a director renowned for restraint  but which is nevertheless consistently interesting.The film opens with a beautiful series of sliding close ups which stress blurred faces and anonymity as we watch a group of radicals discussing revolution specifically as one woman states what does it take to get white people to fight for revolution? What the film is concerned with however is the opposite what stops whites from revolting.Suddenly one man Mark gets up and leaves the discussion. Though revolutionaries fight for freedom Mark is impatient wants quick fixes and views binding oneself to such a militant cause as being akin to giving his one's own freedom away. And so like Jack Nicholson in Antonioni's Passenger Mark flies away. The other radicals promptly chastise Mark for this bourgeois individualism and his blatant intolerance of groups. As such Mark buys a gun and goes solo. Later Mark runs away when police raid a university campus worried that he may be mistook for an actual radical who fired a shot. He then flees to a nearby airfield steals a private plane and flies out into the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia devoid of capitalism's encroachments and contrasts it with America's cities with their billboards plastic people mannequins dreary lives bad food and modern appliances. His desert is Edenic Paradise before The Fall but also Zabriskie Point the lowest point of the United States and so a regressive fantasy.Flying above the desert Mark then spies Daria. He lands and meets her his lusts bringing him promptly back down to earth. Antonioni then gives us a silly sex scene in which hundreds of hippies copulate in the sand. Free from the constraints of modern life radicals celebrate their individualism their primordialism by humping in the sun. Here revolution collapses into hedonism vague notions of revolt giving way to lust personal fulfilment and free love.The film ends with Mark dying after returning a plane. He believes in sharing rather than possessions Antonioni stresses and is punished for this. Meanwhile Daria fantasizes about blowing up the mansions commodities and stately homes of the rich capitalists who inadvertently killed Mark. Less a challenge to its audience  Pick up the guns and pickets! Tear the walls down before they cage you in!  this ultraist sequence is one of profound disappointment the one dimensionality and impossibility of the radical fantasy and the foretold reign of techno capitalism. Daria walks away the world intact.The film is touted as being anti establishment but Mark is the enemy and doesn't know it. He refuses to work with others wants instant gratification quick fixes flees because he doesn't want to be mistook for a radical and his notions of justice all revolve around his own whims wants and desires. 610  In hindsight Zabriskie Point's flaw isn't that it's a radical film directed by a quiet contemplative man it's a film about what prevents whites from being radicals sex selfishness bourgeois individualism fear etc but that its actors can't bring the level of metaphysical intensity to their dialogue that Antonioni is known for. The film is beautifully shot if we ignore some clunky metaphors but simply lacks the haunting intense and even sexy quality of good Antonioni. Incidentally there are many films in which audiences are encouraged to rebel but they all fall into one of four categories. In the first category eg Network Cool Hand Luke Cuckoo's Nest Loneliness of the Long distance Runner If Spartacus we watch as the lives of freedom fighters end in failure though in each case the spirit of revolution survives. In the deaths or failures of our heroes the optimistic notion of change then lives on through martyrdom. Then you have films like Fight Club and Falling Down which simply encourage you to explode. Tear it all down. Go out guns blazing! These films are borne out of angry reactionary feelings rather than any sort of common sense.Then you have the third category The Lives of Others Bound For Glory A Clockwork Orange etc which treat artists as a force of change. In these Dystopian worlds it's the unbridled creativity and freedom of will of the artistcriminal which create waves.Then you have the flight rather than fight category Passenger THX1138 The Devil Probably Logan's Run Red Desert Warriors Easy Rider and Badlands etc which typically show men running from worlds they do not like and forging islands or peaceful havens for themselves. A fifth Utopian category of films doesn't exist because everyone from Marx to modern thinkers have been unable to cook up a workable proactive way out of technocapitalism. The notion of revolution is also complicated by the fact that historically social change is often instigated accidentally by either humble inventors spurred ahead by minor technological advancements or nonviolent protesters who humbly refuse to get off buses. I mean what liberated women more than contraceptives?".

	onyx:emotionText "In Blow Up 1966 Antonioni had his hero question truth against a backdrop of British youth protesters. By setting such questions against a fabric of hippie youth movements Antonioni questioned intentionally or not the effectiveness of these organisations. How can one fight for a cause when what one holds as true might be a lie? On the flip side the film said that we must always actively test what we see precisely because we live in an image bank of deceit at worst uncertainty at best. Though the hippie aspects were the most tacky parts of Blow Up they created a nice texture and gave the film more ambiguity  a sort of widespread ontological uncertainty  than it might otherwise have had. With Zabriskie Point however Antonioni throws away all the ambiguities and subtleties of Blow Up and instead goes full blown hippie. The result is a film awash with clunky metaphors and heavy handed storytelling  disappointing from a director renowned for restraint  but which is nevertheless consistently interesting.The film opens with a beautiful series of sliding close ups which stress blurred faces and anonymity as we watch a group of radicals discussing revolution specifically as one woman states what does it take to get white people to fight for revolution?

	schema:reviewBody "The often misunderstood Zabriskie Point is Antonioni's political film Antonioni's American film. Stylistically it follows suit after BlowUp meaning that the pace is faster than the previous epics though certainly no less idiosyncratic.Basically the common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation. Not so.The two protagonists come from vastly different environments. Mark from the rebel youths Daria from an estate agency corporation. But in true Antonioni fashion they are both alienated both trying to escape their surroundings. Mark leaves a meeting of rebel students and Black Panthers disappointed with the verbose empty rhetoric while Daria keeps uneasily being on the move with her car.Antionioni the master director after portraying the rebelling youth as confused and shallow then moves to the city. An environment saturated by corporatism billboard advertisements meaninglessness that has to keep expanding to accommodate the similar expansion of the population generating a profit at the same time. It is this environment that the two protagonists escape from though it seems mostly out of coincidence.Indeed when Daria stops by a small village in the outskirts of the desert the environment is just as suffocating and the people just as lost cases best exemplified by an old boxing champion now reduced to a shadow of himself sitting around drinking and smoking and talking nonsense. A stunning melancholy sequence made even more powerful with the inclusion of some half wild children living around brought in by some benefactor but destroying a genuine piece of American history. In a notsoobscure symbolism there is Antonioni's opinion on the hippies. Just a halfpositive glimpse in the canvas of human alienation.And then there is the desert the landscape used to devastating effect by turns pure and terrifying primeval wild and dead. The sequence where the two protagonists make love joined in fantasy by the flower generation reflects the similar sequence in Red Desert where Giuliana tells her son a story. It is a colourful intermission in a colourless landscape. A vivid halffantasy in a suffocating reality.The ending probably belongs to the pantheon of great endings in cinema the Western civilization blown to pieces. A catharsis an exorcism.Antionioni's two international films the British BlowUp and the American Zabriskie Point are lesser efforts than the previous masterpieces but that is largely because of the faster pace and the inevitably contrived settings swinging London flowerpower America. But when it comes down to it it's clear he hasn't lost the edge.".

Zabriskie Point stars two young actors named Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin who both are your typical 19601970's hippies who believe in free love and Damn to the Man. Daria Halprin plays Daria and Mark Frechette plays Mark. Duh I guess maybe they just could not pretend to act with someone else's name but I swear their acting was putrid anyway. The screenplay and directing by Michelangelo Antonioni did not help the two actors who were continually interrupted with their love story by scenes that were supposed to grasp our attention but in my humble opinion I just shook my head and said to myself WTF were you thinking? I mean I understand that the early 1970's were a revolutionary time in cinematic experiences enhanced by split screens long pauses and freeze frames lustful film colors vast expanses shock value and some fantastic music scores. Just don't expect any of these visions from Zabriskie Point. I found Michelangelo Antonioni's attempt to deliver a once in a lifetime cinematic experience of his interpretation of how high flying United States business architects would result in catastrophic ruins of the Los Angeles desert to be absolutely ridiculous. The name Michelangelo will remain synonymous with the famed 16th century artistsculptor and not to this hair brained of an idea by screen writerdirector Michelangelo Antonioni who failed to deliver anything more than a piece of crap as his gift to the film historians art world.I give the film a poor 4 out 10 rating".

	schema:headline " Now THAT'S the ticket!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised at this film's low ratings and poor critical reviews. This is a really really good film!  A unique piece of filmmaking like nothing I've seen in a while!  First of all it has a great sense of realism.  Writerdirector Richard Wenk does a brilliant job at capturing the hustle and bustle of New York City streets.  And unlike in many films where directors decide to cut corners and shoot part of the movie in Canada Just the Ticket possesses an authenticity of the Big Apple that only NYbased directors like Martin Scorcese and Sidney Lumet have captured better. There are no gimmicky attempts at style in the words of Mr. Lumet  what's style? we're not bombarded by pretentious shots of the Statue of Liberty or anything like that.  A film like this perfectly captures the essence of New York without patronizing the city.Andy Garcia possibly gives the best performance of his career!  I've always admired him as an actor and I respect almost all Hispanic actors who make it big in showbiz most of them happen to be great actors too.  Garcia displays an unrelenting energy in his performance as ticket scalper Gary Stark.  After watching this film I'm surprised if he doesn't get approached to star in a Broadway play.  He has enough energy to light up the stage! Yet he's charming all the way never obnoxious.  We fall in love with his character.  We fall in love with the supporting characters as well.  Andie McDowell though I don't think she has an attractive presence hey beauty's in the eye of the beholder! is charming as his love interest.  The two Andys have a perfect chemistry togethera real chemistry.  The kind of chemistry that real lovers would possess and not Hollywood lovers.  You can't help but smile every minute they share the screen.  Though they quarrel at times you just keep thinking They were meant for each other. And best of all especially considering it's an Rrated film their relationship is not based on sex.  There's not one sex scene in this movie. If it weren't for some naughty street language you can take the whole family to see this movie.  Richard Bradford is amazingly likeable as Gary's friend for lifefather figure.  You feel more and more sympathy for him which is ironic for a guy who scalps tickets and tells lies for a living and their fatherson relationship as the film goes along.  I was touched by the subplot between Gary and his heroinabusing pregnant friend Cyclops Laura Harris.  Their interactions including his attempts to stop her from abusing drugs are very moving.  I was also glad to see a malefemale friendship that doesn't end in love or sex.  You don't see that too much in the movies.  Rob Liebman who costarred with Garcia in Night Falls on Manhattan makes a few short appearances.  He's a terrific underrated actor and it was great to see the two of them share the screen again.Some may find this film uneven.  I can predict there's going to be a lot of complaints about the way it can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or drama.  I liked the balance between the comedic and dramatic elements with romance rubbed into the equation.  This is not one of those overthetop slapstick screwball comedies that many are probably used to.  It has a good sense of maturity.  And most of the humor is used for comic relief. There's a good deal of drama in the story so don't expect to be laughing all the way.  So if you want to blame someoneblame the ones who marketed this film.  But I was so engaged in the story and characters that I didn't feel a need for laughs.  This is an interesting moving piece of storytelling that never goes over the top and keeps its feet on the ground.  Never once was I uttering this only happens in the movies.  Wenk didn't take any cheap shots and I admire him for that.  So whyoh why was this film so poorly rewarded?Not to mention this the first film to provide insight into the world of ticket scalping.  And I don't think they could've done it any better.  I saw Garcia on Conan O'Brien's show when he was promoting the movie and he said that he did actual field research and posed as a ticket scalper to help get into the shoes of his character.  I'll also mention that a famous celebrity a living legend to some makes a brief appearance.  I was amazed when he appeared on screen.  It wasn't one of those predictable cameos where you had a feeling that person was going to show up anyway.  Face it brace yourselves.  And don't read the complete IMDB cast list before watching the movie it'll ruin the experience.  Just the Ticket is a charming engaging unique touching film that'll fill your heart with good cheer.  It's definitely one of those overlooked flops that'll amaze you.  Plus the soundtrack's great!  Andy Garcia helped compose most of the music for the score.  I developed the biggest smile on my face when they played Signed Sealed Delivered at the final scene. This is a film that captures your heart from all angles.My score  8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Just The Ticket' This current trend of movies being announced for home video before or during  a theatrical run is very heartbreaking.  Good movies are lost in the stampede for the rental market and I feel it cheapens the minor magic of seeing a film in the theater. Another Day In Paradise' Go and At First Sight' are recent examples of this.  Just The Ticket' is the latest.  Appearing in the Phoenix area 6 weeks after its debut it's also about 6 weeks before you can go to Blockbuster and rent it. Sad. What that means to me and seemingly only me due to the reviews I have read is that a very amiable and charming romanticcomedydrama is going to fall below the radar with most people. Andy Garcia is an actor with an amazing dramatic charge that easily makes him one of the best actors we have. It's his choice of films that taint that assessment considerably.I like him a lot and Ticket' gives Garcia that perfect opportunity to show off his range. His performance here as a ticket scalper ranks with his best work.  He can take hold of the moment with the best of them and he has an unbelievably funny scene involving the laserdisc of Stargate.  With Andie MacDowell who I have always believed had the range of a halfempty box of Honey Nut Cherrios Garcia creates believable chemistry. Their scenes of foreplay are truly enjoyable. The background story of Ticket' is that they shot the New York street scenes without a permit often having the citizens around them not aware that a movie was being made.This aspect of the movie is its strongest asset.  The dirty low budget mentality makes the flick more enjoyable. The grainy film stock passerby's looking into the camera and Garcia actually seeming like he's having fun is such a breath of fresh air. It's like a student film with A list actors. Truth be told the film falters when it reaches for more dramatically satisfying material.  A drug addicted pregnant girl a lifechallenged mentor and a rival scalper make for some weak moments.  They threaten to crush the film.  Somehow Garcia with director Richard Wenk make everything come together with a decent ending that doesn't feel forced.  This isn't landmark material but it is the rare film that isn't too forceful and has complete faith in the power of its actors. 8".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are looking for a movie that's perfect and you want to nitpick about the chemistry between the characters or the subtle nuances of one particular character don't watch this one.  But if you're the kind that instead of using a microscope to analyze something would prefer to appreciate something by standing back at a distance and taking it all in and especially if you like romantic comedies this is absolutely definitely the movie for you.I can't believe any company would decide not to put this movie in the theaters.  It was a very good movie not a Bull Durham in quality of storyline directing etc. but it made me feel a helluva lot better than Bull Durham did in the end.  There are more than a few moments where you will probably cry if you are emotional as evidenced by my wife's reaction and though the laughs aren't big the lighter moments certainly work.I've never liked Andie MacDowell and I believe she is the weak link of the entire movie.  I could have seen someone like a Shelley Long or somebody else prettier than MacDowell and certainly someone with more range who would have connected better with Garcia.  But it's probably that fact that makes you really want Andy Garcia to win throughout the movie. He can actually be likeable in his character's helpless role though it's more like the Al Pacino impression that he always does.  Look for Don Novello aka Father Guido Sarducci as one of Gary's friends.  Kudos to Richard Bradford who really made the movie special with his portrayal of Benny the punchdrunk former boxer  ticket hustler he brought the heart to the movie.It really moves well from the 30 minute point on so give it a few minutes if you're not getting into it but I predict if you have a heart at all you will appreciate this movie from start to finish and it builds and progresses like a good movie should to a great and cute ending.It was so good I bought the DVD!".

Andy Garcia was so good as the romantic lead I particularly loved the scenes preparing for the big catering and the the kitchen destruction...too funny!Bottom line I think these two made a great on screen couple and I would recommend this to anyone who like me enjoys these kinds of films or to anyone who might need a little cheering up.".

For me there isn't an actress better when it comes to a love story.Furthermore you see New York in a new light because the movie takes place in the streets of New York as it involves tickets selling.The story is very moving especially the relationship between Garcia and his surrogate father. It talks a lot about dreams failures and resilience.You can be unhappy with the extra text to read or silent makingof but not by the main thing! So try to find it if you can and enjoy this great movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "Movies that are like Just the Ticket are never going to be box office smashes or win major awards but they are all the same charming and well worth seeking out. It's kind of a mash between several different genres it's alternately a comedy a romance and a character study. The comedy is gentle but does provoke some laughs my favorite scene being when Andy Garcia's character impersonates a television salesman. The romance between Garcia's and Andie MacDowell's characters does have heart plus some bittersweet moments that feel true to life. The examination of Garcia's character is really interesting. Although it's clear he's not a bad person he is all the same a dreamer who resists the painful truths that reality have to offer sometimes hurting people along the way. All these different genres are pretty well done and mix well together. I admit the movie is a tad long at 114 minutes in length when a slightly quicker pace might have helped. Also what happens near the end is kind of a deus ex machina plot twist though the happy ending it provides feels right for the movie. These nitpicks don't hurt the movie too much however and the movie ends up being a very pleasant sleeper.".

	schema:reviewBody "La Bamba which stars Lou Diamond Phillips as tragic 50's rocker Ritchie Valensreal name Richard Valenzuela is my favorite rock bio film.  The film covers the Mexican American Valens' rise from poverty in California to becoming a rock n roll superstar at the young age of 17 only to lose it all within 8 months on the Day the Music Died. In addition to focusing on Valens' music career writerdirector Luis Valdez spends time showing the tense relationship between Ritchie and his older brother Bob who is played excellently by Esai Morales.  As Ritchie becomes famous Bob begins to resent him and that provides the film with some of its most powerful and heartbreaking scenes.The film's other effective moments come between Ritchie and his girlfriend Donna.  During their scenes together I felt that Valdez did a good job in showing what teenage romances must've been like back in the more innocent 1950's and how parents prejudices could interfere.Last but not least is the film's great soundtrack.  Ritchie Valens songs were redone for the film by the group Los Lobos.  All of the instrumental music was provided by Carlos Santana and Miles Goodman.  Also included are many other classic songs from the 50's.The only small criticism I have of the film is that Valdez spends too much time in foreshadowing Valens' fate through dream sequences and references to his fear of flying.  While it is documented that Ritchie did have a fear of flying I would imagine that he didn't talk about it as frequently as he does in the film.Overall I think that La Bamba is a film about sticking to your dreams and the importance of family.  I give this film a pretty strong recommendation. You don't even necessarily have to be a fan of 50's music to enjoy it.  This is for those who enjoy small films that deal with the triumphs and struggles of everyday people.".

One of them was only 17 years old five years older than me.La Bamba the title of his biggest hit in his all too brief career tells the life story of Ritchie Valens shortened from Valenzuela so he could appeal to a wider audience. Today that would never happen he'd tell them to get it on the theater marquee somehow. It sticks pretty close to the facts.I saw a picture of Ritchie Valens when I actually bought a vinyl record when La Bamba came out. It contained all the known recordings for Ritchie Valens including a few instrumental tracks he hadn't time to do the vocals for. A lot of those songs are heard in this film.The real Ritchie Valens looked more like a high school football player than a musician. He was a big bull of a kid and Lou Diamond Phillips doesn't look a bit like him. Yet Lou captures the spirit of a kid who lived for his music and his family in reverse order.The key to this film is the triangular relationship between Phillips his mother Roseanne DeSoto and his older half brother Esai Morales. There were two younger sisters but no doubt Roseanne favored the younger son. Morales is an outlaw biker rebel who later does find salvation and a good career as an illustrator and we do see the beginning of that. But he's supporting the family with a few illegal activities so Ritchie the good kid can work on his music. In my family not my immediate family we had a situation where the mother favored the younger over the older son. It was a sad situation because I knew both and the older man was a nice man and a good citizen. I could really understand where Morales was coming from.La Bamba is a good look at Chicano culture in America during the Eisenhower years before Cesar Chavez organized the farm workers. That's where Ritchie Valens came from but it was some drug money that got Roseanne DeSoto out of the migrant worker camps and into a house. Money that Morales got.Ritchie's three hits in his all too brief career Come On Let's Go Donna and the title song are all included and performed by Los Lobos. La Bamba is a Mexican folk song that Ritchie adapted and made a rock and roll hit a reconnection to his roots for the world to see.Everyone in this wonderful film is perfectly cast and makes you feel like you are inside the heart and soul of the Ricardo Valenzuela 19421959.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this movie in 1987 I thought everything in this movie about Ritchie Valens was 100 true.  But a couple of years ago I bought a book and a CD that talked about Ritchie Valens's life.  It is a complete lie that he and his family worked picking peaches that his producer Bob Keane was nervous about Ritchie singing La Bamba or that he constantly obsessed about the nightmares associated about a friend of his getting killed by a falling airplane. He did have a friend that got killed by a falling airplane but he didn't obsess about it all the time.  Contrary to popular belief ganied from this movie Ritchie had many girlfriends not just Donna. If you don't believe me then buy a CD called The Ritchie Valens Story.  In it will contain pictures of Ritchie' childhood and various girls he met on tours. I think it's stupid how the movie acts as if Ritchie Valens knew he was going to die for sure in a plane crash.  I lost somebody in my family due to an accident and trust me neither anyone in my family his friends or even himself knew he would die young.  The movie called The Buddy Holly Story with Gary Busey is a little far fetched like La Bamba but at least that movie didn't have scenes with obsessions of Buddy dying young! I honestly think someone needs to make another biography movie  about Ritchie Valens.  Even a TV special would be good!  While you're at it pick ACCURATE facts about Buddy Holly and make another biography movie on him.".

It is a complete lie that he and his family worked picking peaches that his producer Bob Keane was nervous about Ritchie singing La Bamba or that he constantly obsessed about the nightmares associated about a friend of his getting killed by a falling airplane. He did have a friend that got killed by a falling airplane but he didn't obsess about it all the time.  Contrary to popular belief ganied from this movie Ritchie had many girlfriends not just Donna. If you don't believe me then buy a CD called The Ritchie Valens Story.  In it will contain pictures of Ritchie' childhood and various girls he met on tours. I think it's stupid how the movie acts as if Ritchie Valens knew he was going to die for sure in a plane crash.  I lost somebody in my family due to an accident and trust me neither anyone in my family his friends or even himself knew he would die young.  The movie called The Buddy Holly Story with Gary Busey is a little far fetched like La Bamba but at least that movie didn't have scenes with obsessions of Buddy dying young! I honestly think someone needs to make another biography movie  about Ritchie Valens.  Even a TV special would be good!  While you're at it pick ACCURATE facts about Buddy Holly and make another biography movie on him.";

Its a much better film than the fictionalised account of Holly in that virtually everything happened as it was portrayed. Valens had a pretty low profile in the UK and suffered from cover versions and a terrible Welsh singer who more or less took his name in 1960. His music was mainly high school pop but when he tapped into the Mexican folk song which gives its name to the movie he could be seen as the catalyst for Twist  Shout. This film is thus the only real development in the story of Ritchie Valens.As he was basically a Chicano musician his legacy led through the years to Chan RomeroChris Montezthe Sir Douglas QuintetSam the Sham  the Pharoahs and finally Freddy Fender who began his career at the same time as Valens but who had to wait over 25 years before his first hit single. Its the story of a brother and half brother and a family who lived in a settlement in conditions close to poverty.The half brother was a wastrel who took drugs and drank heavilyRitchie was the opposite and had ambition. Its as much about the times than anythingEddie Cochran was seen played by a Stray Cat and within a year he too would have been killed in a car crash. The film goes a long way to show just how precarious the music business is.In real life Valens had a hit single followed by a couple of flops before hitting paydirt with a double sider in 1959 just at the time of his death.Barely in the music business long enough to make an album there nevertheless was oneissued posthumously and since then his name has been kept alive by no more than this albumone of demos and another recorded more by accident on a tape recorder at his school".

	schema:reviewBody "You are unlikely to have heard of The Lives of a Bengal Lancer. It has long been overshadowed by it's more popular contemporaries Beau Geste and Gunga Din though it is in my humble opinion a finer film then either of them. But I'm getting ahead of myself let's start at the beginning.The Lives of a Bengal Lancer is the story of a regiment of British soldiers in Imperial India. It's an adventure film first and foremost but it is also an intimate drama about the life of a soldier in an age of Victorian honor chivalry and stiff upper lip stoicism. The characters are all interesting and complex and the dialogue is witty and literate.The film holds up very well for a movie made in 1935 largely due to the lack of any melodramatic romantic subplots which have permanently marred other adventure films of the period. This is a man's film about men in desperate situations it's about being willing to die for your country or your friends at a moments notice. It's about a concept that most people consider outdated honor. How many films have you seen recently about honor loyalty and true courage? Probably not many. The action scenes are exhilarating and the film really does a wonderful job of establishing it's Indian setting.The performances are all first rate Gary Cooper stars as Lt. McGregor. I've always imagined Cooper as the quiet serious everyman characters he played later in his career. Here he gets to try his hand at comedy and complexity and gives arguably the most layered performance of his career. Franchot Tone is also perfectly cast he won on Oscar the same year for his performance in Mutiny on the Bounty but his performance in this film is equally deserving of acclaim. Tone was one of the best actors of the 1930's though he never really hit it big as a leading man. He's wonderful here his character exudes charm and wit and he and Cooper bounce off each other wonderfully. Richard Cromwell is a little over the top but he makes sense for the character. British stage actor Guy Standing plays Colonel Stone as being emotionless on the outside and yet torn apart on the inside having to make the impossible choice between loyalty to one's family and loyalty to one's country. It's a great performance for which he should have received an Oscar nomination. As for C. Aubrey Smith he is wonderful as usual the quintessential British officer often imitated but never equaled there is no one like the man himself. Douglas Dumbrille also gives a fine performance as the evil Muhammad Khan.The Lives of a Bengal Lancer is a great film that has been unfairly denied the classic status it so deserves. For years the only way to see it was on Turner Classic Movies but recently it was released as one of the five films on the 25 Gary Cooper Collection. Don't miss it.10 out of 10 Also though most people don't know it this is the film in which the now famous line We have ways of making men talk is first uttered.".

	schema:reviewBody "I picked this little beauty up simply because of Gary Cooper and the subject matter. Having loved Gunga Din this seemed like a good choice. Cooper as Macgregor the top billed hero of the piece gives a strong warm and wry performance. The standout surprise of the piece though is that he is upstaged at nearly every turn by Franchot Tone. The banter between the two is great and takes full advantage of the witty and cynical dialogue. Young Richard Cromwell on the other hand makes very little impression until the final scenes of the picture. The British institution that is C. Aubrey Smith makes a wonderful patriotic speech from under his formidably bristling eyebrows that brings the house down.The storyline is pretty standard stuff three heroes in the face of overwhelming odds fight to uphold British dominance on the Indian Frontier. The strength of the film lies in the characterizations of the leads and the incredible settings and action sequences. A good deal of first rate horsemanship is also in evidence as we are treated to a full Lancer charge and scenes of tent pegging and pig sticking. The final battle is a glorious and exciting sequence that modern film makers would learn a great deal from. The script does have its goofy moments in the later torture sequences as we are treated to lines like We have ways of making men talk and are shown the old bamboo under the fingernails bit but even the cliches seem fitting.If grand adventure with an emphasis on style is your idea of a good time you'd be hard put to find a better example than this film!".

When two new recruits arrive as replacements one of them being Colonel Stone's son the Lancers must stop the rebels from stealing ammunition from the Emir of Gopal all parties must put aside their problems to help the war effort.Henry Hathaway's adaptation of Francis YeatsBrown's novel is one of the best war films of the 30s wonderfully scripted by Grover Jones it's laced with army humour and tells a great story of friendships and family ties. The Indian heavy atmosphere is gorgeous something Hathaway clearly excelled at portraying with Charles Lang  Ernest Schoedsack's photography beautifully realising this period in history. For sure the imperialistic nature of the piece is prominent but it is never overdone with the rebel Indians painted more as a resourceful enemy than in other notable pictures of the time. The action sequences are adroitly handled and the acting particularly from Gary Cooper as McGregor is on the money whilst the ending hits hard and quite frankly stirs the blood. The Lives Of A Bengal Lancer is a golden picture from a golden age an adventure yarn to watch each and every year. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Gary Cooper stars as a professional soldier opposite Franchot Tone as the cocky one and Richard Cromwell as the wide eyed new recruit. Cromwell's father happens to be the commanding officer and that puts Cooper and Tone against Cromwell for the time being. Of course the two main leads are also at odds and that makes for some interesting situations.Henry Hathaway gave us his best work with Gary Cooper and this is their best collaboration. It's also Franchot Tone's best film and that's saying a lot when you look at his resume. He may be fairly unknown with today's audience but the star of Five Graves to Cairo Dangerous and Mutiny on the Bounty is one of the best actors of the golden age of Hollywood.Nothing beats Gary Cooper though and this is his film. He's the main lead and he's the one you'll probably identify with the most. His noble character is something that we see all the time from him but this is the role that started it all and that's why he plays it so well.This very good adventure story will keep you on the edge of your seat during most of the film. It's especially harrowing in the climactic fight scene. I definitely recommend it to any fan of Gary Cooper and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER can take its place among the best of the Hollywood version of Colonial India during the 1800s where the danger and excitement is derived from tales similar to the more famous GUNGA DIN where the British Army has its share of conflict with the Indians who think their country is being occupied.And like GUNGA DIN it revolves around a threesome of male buddies played by GARY COOPER FRANCHOT TONE and RICHARD CROMWELL. Cooper is the strongest of the leads a Lt. McGregor who has been sent to welcome two new soldiers to the military post. One of them Cromwell is the naively inexperienced son of the post's commander and prone to go astray without guidance from Cooper and Tone. The relationships are not without friction usually with humorous episodes thrown in and of course there's the requisite loyalty courage and danger involved in all of their undertakings.Much of it feels similar to other stories of courage beyond endurance and scenes of torture where the captive soldiers exhibit the bravery instilled in them by the military. GARY COOPER is at his most Gary Cooperlike persona stoic and brave in the role of the heroic McGregor and FRANCHOT TONE does extremely well as his humorous buddy. RICHARD CROMWELL tends to overact in melodramatic '30s style the only weakness in the cast.Good support from a cast including DOUGLAS DUMBRILLE J.

	schema:reviewBody "Long before I saw this I knew a small trivia fact and that is it's reported to have been Adolph Hitler's favourite movie . It's not contradictory . The Indian subcontinent is the birth place of the swastika and is proudly displayed everywhere  well almost everywhere because I don't recall seeing any of them in Manali which is the Mecca for the Israeli stoner . Interesting too that the Nazis were very much pro Muslim and had during the war two Waffen SS divisions one of which the 13th Waffen SS division was composed of Bosnian Muslims and the other the 14th Waffen SS division being composed of Albanians . The Nazis got round the small matter of these Muslims being Slavs by categorizing them as Persians hence qualified as IndoAyransApparently Hitler was fascinated by the fact a small island like Britain could govern and rule a large country like India with a population of over 300 million inhabitants . This is easily explained . India is a large country with massive diversity . What you do is divide and rule  just convince the people in one state are British and the people in the next state are a bunch of trouble makers saying nasty things about the royal family and need sorting out . If the people in the next state are of a different religion well that makes the task much easier . Hitler had future designs on ruling the Soviet Union along similar lines but went around it the wrong way by committing genocide against the entire Soviet population . If he only convinced people in conquered territories that they were German and the people up the road were nasty communists intent on causing nuisance then he might have won the war . He should have listened to the dialogue in the opening scene when McGregor is warned  You're far too impulsive Being a Hollywood movie not too much is given to facts . It's not factual that cobras are attracted to music because they have no ears and the hyponotic effect of a snake charmer on a cobra is down to body language . Neither is it correct that a Muslim falling in battle is guaranteed  forty eight maidens in paradise  The number is supposedly seventy two but the real figure is actually zero . There is also no such race as  Scotch  which is an alcoholic beverage and the correct term is Scottish which will be of no interest to anyone outside of Scotland But Hollywood don't do documentaries . Hollywood does spectacle  action and derring do and this movie has it in abundance . This is Boys Own adventure printed on celluloid and fueled an appetite for historical adventure and being from the golden era of Hollywood it's rather more enjoyable than the long winded CGI driven stuff like we got with TITANIC and PEARL HARBOR . It does seem contrived that two of the main characters have North American accents since one is supposed to be Scotch Canadian and the other was brought up in America . It also contains the line  The Scotch are a queer race  so I guess it also influenced Pat Robertson as well as Hitler".

'Gunga Din' did it better though and there is an undercurrent of animosity and less chemistry among the three here.The action is uneven coming at the beginning and at the end of the picture and in between it is a character study. Luckily for director Hathaway he had some excellent acting talent on hand and you are not conscious of the lack of action. C.Aubrey Smith Sir Guy Standing Douglas Dumbrille and Akim Tamiroff are present in addition to the 3 principals Cooper Franchot Tone And Richard Cromwell. Standing is especially good as the Company Commander. He gives a sensitive nuanced performance worthy of a British stage actor which he was before coming to Hollywood. I don't often insert spoilers in my reviews but I just had to make mention of one of my alltime villainous movie characters the wimpy feckless Lt. Stone played by Richard Cromwell. It is he who gets Gary Cooper killed towards the end of the picture and which has earned him my everlasting animosity. Why couldn't they just leave him prisoner? Why couldn't they get a different actor? Truly there never was such a weakling as Cromwell.As you can see I take my action heroes seriously. Maybe that's what makes motion pictures so entertaining  if done well they seem real. Lives Of A Bengal Lancer easily earns a 7.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to remember sometimes when you get caught up in watching a film like Lives of a Benger Lancer that in fact the British were the occupiers and the bandits were in fact fighting against who they considered invaders.The British didn't take over India in a classical war of armed conquest. During the 17th and 18th centuries they were among a whole series of European powers who were looking for trading rights and who gradually made deals with several of the local rulers like the ones you see portrayed in this film. A guy named Robert Clive finally defeated the French and the British were the only ones left on the subcontinent except for two Portugese enclaves on the Indian west coast. Great Britain ruled very little of India directly. They only could run it with a LOT of collaboration which they had. They were seen as occupiers however even by those who collaborated.Having said that the British Army over its period in India established a great military tradition. In fact their army in India was viewed as almost a wholly separate entity.The Lives of the Bengal Lancers is part of that tradition. True to Hollywood in order to have Americans star in a British location we make them Canadians. Well Gary Cooper was from Montana and that's close enough to Canada. Franchot Tone with his clipped and professionally stage trained speech patterns I guess Paramount figured could pass for British. And Richard Cromwell was given an American mother.Cooper is a frontier officer who is sent to meet two new arrivals Tone from another regiment and Cromwell straight from Sandhurst. Cromwell is the son of the post commander a real spit and polish type played by Sir Guy Standing. Their clash is what sets off the events of this film.Douglass Dumbrille plays a very smooth and deadly villain as bandit leader Mohammed Khan. And C. Aubrey Smith is fine as the fort's second in command.The later and more comic Gunga Din had a lot of the same plot in it. The final battle between the British lancers and Dumbrille's forces is pretty exciting though the heroics of our three officers today's audience might find a bit much.Still The Lives of a Bengal Lancer is a good action adventure saga and a fine tribute to the men who served in the lancers.".

A New York Times Ten Best. Number 7 on the National Board of Review list.COMMENT Hathaway had previously directed Cooper and Shirley Temple in Now and Forever but Lives of a Bengal Lancer was the movie that really made his reputation. Of course he had a great script to begin with a marvelous cast and some superb technicians. One of the most exciting adventures ever filmed the gripping witty script perfectly captures the India of Kipling and the British raj much more so than movies like Gandhi and Heat and Dust. The dialogue with its smart wisecracking lines and the characters so memorably and indelibly drawn are given perfect life by an absolutely firstrate cast. Cooper never had a better role serving as an effective stooge for Tone and a remarkable catalyst for the rest of the players particularly Smith and Cromwell. Tone has the best of the witty lines delivering them with such delightful ease and polished suavity as to win over even those skeptics to whom adventure films are hardly flavorofthemonth. Sir Guy Standing also contributes a beautifully rounded characterization. He is one of the empire breed floundering in personal relationships yet parrying the villainous Douglas Dumbrille with diplomatic skill. Mr. Dumbrille makes with the menacing sneer with his usual oleaginous charm while Kathleen Burke purrs seductively as his accomplice in a small but memorably villainous role. And we cannot leave the players without singling out Akim Tamiroff for his deliciously wheezy portrait of a friendly Emir.Directed with such flair as to make the whole exotic action and background thoroughly believable superbly photographed even if the masterfully lit studio material tends to show up the cruder 2nd unit and location footage with eyecatching sets and a rousing music score Lives of a Bengal Lancer is one of the greatest adventure movies of all time.Using an astonishingly literate script which spoofs the romanticism of Kilpingesque narrative clichs while retaining the essence of Kipling's imperial philosophy doubtless carried over from the autobiographical original novel director Henry Hathaway certainly creates a solid impression of authenticity. . But Hathaway's talent is not the only one to admire in this remarkable film The photography of Charles Lang stunning in its deep focus shots of cavalry winding through rocky defile breathtaking in its group shots where a skillful deployment of light and shadow give the illusion of a third dimension. I must also commend the distinguished playing of Sir Guy Standing as Colonel Stone  note especially those scenes in which he changes from a ramrod martinet to a stammering father note the brief despairing glance of his eyes  or note their twinkle when he deals suave diplomacy under the guise of a harmless old buffer of the pukka sahib school. C. Aubrey Smith is also a standout as Major Hamilton whose resonant voice so beautifully expounds the glories of empire and I must also commend the disarmingly relaxed easy performance of Franchot Tone. Douglas Dumbrille as Ahmed Khan has some effective dialogue exchanges  I love the scene where he haggles over the price of rugs with Cooper and Tone who are disguised as Indian merchants. Suddenly his face breaks into a sarcastic smile Come come gentlemen! he says. Is this becoming officers of the King's 41st Lancers?".

Aubrey Smith is also a standout as Major Hamilton whose resonant voice so beautifully expounds the glories of empire and I must also commend the disarmingly relaxed easy performance of Franchot Tone. Douglas Dumbrille as Ahmed Khan has some effective dialogue exchanges  I love the scene where he haggles over the price of rugs with Cooper and Tone who are disguised as Indian merchants. Suddenly his face breaks into a sarcastic smile Come come gentlemen! he says. Is this becoming officers of the King's 41st Lancers?";

	schema:reviewBody "The epic scope of the film is particularly impressive considering it's release in 1935 and without the complexity of today's computer generated effects. Director Henry Hathaway relocates his experiences with the American Wild West to the more exotic locales of northwest India above the Khyber Pass. There he focuses on the good natured rivalry between Lieutenant Alan McGregor Gary Cooper and two newly assigned junior officers Forsythe Franchot Tone and Stone Richard Cromwell members of the 41st Bengal Lancers. The plot is thickened by the authority of Colonel Tom Stone Guy Standing father of Mr. Stone from Sandhurst immediately creating a dynamic tension between familial and military concerns.There's a bit more to it than that as well weighing on the Colonel's mind are an impending retirement and the responsibility of his assignment to protect the Indian Emir from a coalition of hostile tribes led by Mohammed Khan Douglas Dumbrille. His 'service comes first' mentality is repeatedly tested by Cooper's character who refers to the Colonel as 'old ramrod' in fact McGregor is probably one of the most insubordinate officers in film history if you count the number of times he disobeys orders.The younger Stone is at odds throughout the story as to how to impress his overbearing father. The boar hunt goes badly and later he falls victim to the Khan's kidnap plot utilizing the wiles of the sultry Tania Kathleen Burke. Ultimately he earns his redemption but at a high price as the officer trio reunites to destroy Khan's stolen ammunition supply. That he didn't have the courage to resist torture like his comrades is inexorably relived during the presentation of the Distinguished Service Order when he has all he can do to hold back his welling tears.Any story set in India probably wouldn't be complete without the obligatory dancing cobra scene. Here it's done to somewhat comic effect when the bantering Forsythe finally receives his comeuppance from the older officer McGregor. Of course as with most films this one doesn't get it scientifically accurate either. Cobras are not enchanted by the music they can't hear but the swaying motion of the player and his instrument for his part Forsythe looked a bit too terrified to sway.Curiously Canadian born Douglass Dumbrille has just the right look to be plausible as a foreigner. His character here exudes both charm and malice and he would go on to portray a varied assemblage of international characters in film. One that immediately comes to mind was a comic turn in the 1950 teamup with Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion.As a fan of the classics I have a preferred taste for black and white films but every once in a while there's a scene that simply begs for the color treatment. As guests of the Emir the Lancers are shown in full ceremonial regalia which look quite stunning. Kind of makes you wish for a modern day remake if only they would stay away from the CGI.".

Aubrey Smith and Douglas Dumbrille.The story takes place in India in the northwest frontier. The 41st Bengal Lancers have had casualties due to a rebel leader Mohammed Khan. Replacements for the lost men appear Lt. Forsythe Tone and Donald Stone Richard Cromwell the son of the head of the Lancers Colonel Stone. Lt. Alan McGregor Cooper rooms with them due to the fact that he's usually in trouble. Forsythe loves singing Mother Macree and pushing McGregor's buttons but McGregor bonds with the young Stone. Eventually all three become friends.When Stone's son is kidnapped by Mohammed Khan McGregor and Forsythe want to go after him but Stone forbids it. The two men dress as Indians and go to Khan's base to rescue Stone.Rousing film with plenty of action which was one of Hathaway's specialties with all locations in California but under the hot sun it could be India. This is the movie where the famous line We have ways of making you talk comes from except that's not the line it's We have ways of making men talk  somehow these famous lines are never exact.Gary Cooper is excellent  gorgeous as usual energetic and passionate. I just saw him in Ten North Fredrick so it was a delight to see him in this 23 years earlier so young and strong. Tone who replaced Henry Wilcoxin is very good and babyfaced Richard Cromwell is right for his role as a kid who wants to be treated like one of the Lancers and not have any special privileges. Cromwell was married to Angela Lansbury for five minutes or so and was in and out of films working ultimately as an artist.Lots of action and adventure  hard to know why it isn't appreciated today because the characters are strong with real relationships and good dialogue. I think I know why  Gunga Din is a George Stevens' film and Beau Geste was directed by William Wellman. Since Hathaway isn't considered a director in that league I have a feeling this film is often passed over. It's a shame it deserves rediscovery.".

This film was made in Hollywood's golden era when movies were fantastic adventures to be treasured not necessarily believed. This is a very grim tale of war and sacrifice but fun nonetheless. That the imperialists are the good guys is just a sign of the time when it was made. I wonder how bigoted the movies being made today will look to audiences 70 years from now? The sets were of course very well done and the photography was superb. During the mid to late thirties the art of the film reached it's zenith.Before then such spectacle was rare but by 1939 it had become common.

	onyx:emotionText "Right. A snake is charmed by a musical instrument. There are only Moslems and Englishmen and no Hindus or Jains in India. A troop of Indians stop fighting and start praying when their commander is killed. The son of the very British captain has a distinctly American accent and so does the ScotchCanadian. The beautiful girl dances with anyone who walks up to her even if they don't speak a word first. The British troop when ambushed doesn't run for cover or even stop chatting. This story is so full of holes I could barely watch it through to the end. If you're looking for a movie which has stood the test of time this isn't it. Keep looking.

	schema:reviewBody "The Wrestler is a drama centered around an aging professional wrestler past his prime. It's so much more than that. You don't have to be a fan of wrestling to enjoy this film. The wrestling part of it can be put aside as a back story. Randy The Ram could be in any other profession doing any other thing and could be in the same situation. That's what's so great about it. He's just a lonely guy whose life seems to have passed him by. A middle aged man who doesn't have much going for him. Sure he's a wrestler but he needs wrestling more than wrestling needs him. He needs it to feel important to feel like a somebody. He really has nothing to show for himself no wife just a daughter he hasn't been there for his whole life. Missed opportunities. He's sad and alone and we really do feel for him.A closer bond seems to be forming between him and his stripper friend played by Marisa Tomei who seems to be in a similar situation as he is. The middle aged stripper who seems to have a real connection with The Ram is shown in another misunderstood profession. We all may not be as different as we may think. Health problems compromise his wrestling career as he tries to deal with the real world and rebuild his relationship with his abandoned daughter. The scenes with Evan Rachel Wood his daughter are touching. Beautifully done. Rourke's character portrayal of the Ram is one of the best in a long time. He's not just acting he transforms into the character on screen. It's amazing to watch. All the credit he's getting is truly deserved.The film is Directed by Darren Aronofsky who also directed Requiem for a Dream. He does a beautiful job showing the sport with realism. The film respects the wrestlers and their world and expects the same from the audience. This film is done in a style that's so real so honest so amazing in easily one of the best films of the year. All around great performances and great direction. Definitely worth checking out sometime.".

Rourke's life and tumultuous past parallel Randy The Ram Robinson's own life so eerily close it becomes clear that no one else could have ever played this role. Darren Aronofsky's fourth feature is not only his most intimate but also his most accomplished to date. Aronofsky offers his most simplistic film both visually and narratively and ends up creating a film that has more depth and layers to it than any of his previous films.Everything about Randy's life is in a state of decay. He retains a body that is on the verge of collapse he hasn't seen his only daughter in years financially he is exhausted and the only thing that brings him solace in life is the same thing that threatens to end it. The most effective aspect of Randy's character is that no matter what mistakes he might have made in the past his sense of regret is so strong and genuine that it is impossible not to forgive him. As beaten down and alone as Randy might be he never looses his fighting spirit or sense of hope no matter how little it may be. Regardless what hardship Randy is confronted with he never retreats and is admirably courageous even if being courageous might not be the smartest settlement.For the general public who tend to find professional wrestling laughable and are quick to judge as a form of entertainment rather than a sport will find a deadly adversary in Aronofsky. The Wrestler shows that while outcomes of matches may be fixed the physical tolls these men take on their body are often more extreme and long lasting than most other respectable sports. The fact that Randy gives so much of himself and is ridiculed from everywhere to the trailer park he lives in to the job he keeps while not in the ring makes us even more empathetic to the struggle Randy goes through to try and make it back on top. Overall The Wrestler is a constantly engaging and compelling character study with some of the finest acting writing directing I have seen in recent years. Oh and I forgot the last shot will leave you speechless.".

The same goes for the film.The film was shocking to me For instance it was a shock seeing Rourke Randy The Ram  with the long flowing blond hair and rippling muscles. Hey it's not that former boxer was ever in bad shape but he never had muscles like this either. The man must have pumped a lot of iron to get ready for this role as an aging wrestler.Another shock was seeing Maria Tomei of My Cousin Vinny fame naked  and in that state in more than one scene. She didn't leave much to the imagination as Cassidy. A third shock was seeing some of the early wrestling scenes. Yeah pro wrestling is rough stuff and it's bloody and it's fake etc. but the scenes in here are pretty brutal more than I've ever seen on TV. The one extended match with the staples was pretty gruesome.Evan Rachel Wood is convincing as Randy's daughter Stephanie. This 21yearold is no stranger to acting having been doing it since she was four! The scenes with her and her dad are memorable.When the shock of the above scenes of sex and violence and language fade away underneath it all is a very tender sad tale of a lonely man who invested too much in his career and after coming close to mortality realizes the important of family and simply being loved by anyone. That's what sticks with you long after the film ends. Loneliness can be a killer.Randy tries to mend fences and post a few himself  in his final quest not to wind up as an island in this world of humanity  with both successful and unsuccessful results. Sometimes you can never change what you are and sometimes you can. Both of those are demonstrated here in this oddlyedgybut sentimental film.".

No one else could have played Randy The Ram Robinson with the compassion and energy he brings to the roleit's painful to see the fading professional wrestler coming to terms with both his mortality and the emptiness of his life outside the ring and this is largely due to Rourke's excellent acting. Twenty years after the defining match of his career Randy is still a fan favorite and loving his workuntil he suffers a heart attack. The film follows the gentle giant as he tries to adjust to living without wrestling reconnect with his estranged daughter Evan Rachel Wood and kindle a bond with a friend who works in a strip club Marisa Tomei.This isn't just a film about professional wrestling but Aronofsky gets that part right. He does a beautiful job showing the sport with realism without mocking it he highlights the humor but never makes fun of it. He doesn't just deconstruct the mythical image of wrestlers' performances but he also destroys their apparent rage towards each other. It's clear that these guys are friendsthey care about and respect each other. These other wrestlers in the film are all played by professionals and they do a great job with the acting. The film respects them and their world and demands the same from the audience.The other supporting characters are strong as well. Tomei and Wood's characters could easily have fallen into clichs but they give Randy some of his best moments on screen. Tomei's storyline especially serves as a nice parallel and contrast to Randy's. Wood's could use a little more juice but her story arc does the same. Both are effective.Another notable aspect of the film is its music. The character of Randy is a big '80s rock fan and for the film they got the rights to use Guns N' Roses' Sweet Child o' Mine. A special thanks at the end of the film went out to Axl Rose. On the softer side Bruce Springsteen wrote The Wrestler for the credits and its sweet melancholy serves as the perfect coda for the film.Overall 'The Wrestler' is great. It's a rich round film that smoothly weaves together pathos and comedy and soul. It's funny and dramatic tearjerking and tough. Definitely a mustsee this winter.".

Very rarely do you see an actor come back with such a role. He is truly extraordinary in The Wrestler. There are times in this film when I wonder just how much of this is Mickey in character as The Ram or Mickey reacting as Mickey to a situation similar to what he went through in his lost years. The parallels are astounding. There is a scene when Randy The Ram is in the ring and he points to the audience It is not over until you tell me it's over. Is it Mickey or Randy talking there? As a newly revived Mickey Rourke fan I can tell you this audience member says it's just beginning Mickey!Marissa Tomei delivers a stellar performance as an aging exotic dancer the parallel story to Mickey's character The Ram. Evan Rachel Wood really brings it as The Rams angry abandoned and emotionally exhausted daughter. The chemistry between Mickey and Evan is breath taking!Darren Aronofsky delivers this story to us with honesty realism and artistic skill. I think this young director will be around making fantastic films for some time to come. At least I hope he is!You can't go wrong with this film. It is rock solid to the core!Facts from the QAOnly the 3rd American Film to with the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.The film was made for 7 Million.The filmscore is more atmospheric as the composer did not want to interfere with the documentary feel of the film.Mickey Rourke trained for 6 months to get to the wrestling weight of 235 for the film.

The actors put on music before the scene and just talked about their real life and Mickey's parallels to the film. When the director felt they were there he would yell action and they would work through the scene. The scenes back stage with the wrestlers were all real as well. The crew would go to wrestling matches and film the wrestlers beforeafter matches. Mickey would walk in and introduce himself in character and the scene was improvised. The film was about 2030 improvisation from the actors.".

He had a legendary payperview match against the Ayatollah in his prime his own Nintendo game posters Best of The Ram VHS series and legions of fans who worshipped him. The film begins in the present day with The Ram collecting a paltry sum of money for his latest fight only to discover he's been locked out of his trailer home because he's behind on his rent. He has a good physique for his age  with the aid of steroids and tanning salons  he still has good friends in the local wrestling brotherhood and he enjoys hanging out with Cassidy played by Marisa Tomei at the strip club where she works. He's a likable guy and the neighbourhood kids look up to him as a hero so it's easy to root for this washedup old wrestler as he participates in choreographed yet amazingly bloody wrestling matches. He struggles to pay the rent while also searching for deeper meaning in his life as he knows that he can't wrestle forever. However wrestling is the only thing he's good at and he lives for those precious moments when he stands on the top turnbuckle and his adoring fans cheer his name  but once he steps out of the ring his life is a mess. He'd like to reconcile with estranged daughter Stefanie played by Evan Rachel Wood but she hates him after he abandoned her in her youth. He's never given her a birthday gift probably because he doesn't know which day it is.There's a parallel story with Cassidy an aging stripper. She also knows that her career is coming to an end but unlike The Ram she seems to have plans after she retires and her finances are in good order. They've obviously known each other for quite some time and though there seems to be some mutual attraction Cassidy has always followed the rule don't get involved with a customer. They have a complex relationship that changes throughout the film but you can always feel that Cassidy cares about his wellbeing.This movie works because it feels so real. All the characters are so natural in their roles that you'll feel drawn into this world of wrestling. Mickey Rourke doesn't just play a wrestler he is a wrestling star he is Randy The Ram in every way. The wrestling scenes were also amazingly crafted and you can see Randy build off the crowd's excitement. The film does a great job of showing why so many fans love fake wrestling.I thoroughly enjoyed this little film but it's not for all tastes. It's gritty raw sometimes depressing sometimes funny and yeah I'll admit that I cried. A 9.510 for me and it's a mustsee for wrestling fans especially from 1980s era and obviously anyone who enjoyed the previous works of Aranofsky andor Rourke. Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei were both outstanding and Evan Rachel Wood also shone in her supporting role.".

	schema:reviewBody "Enough has been written already about Mickey Rourke's reallife parallels with his fictional character in The Wrestler. Yes it makes the story seem even realer and is perhaps what attracted Rourke to the project. Or perhaps not  perhaps instead it is what attracted Darren Aronofsky to the actor. But to focus on such surface similarities seems like an undermining of his work here. Rourke may not be as outofhiscomfortzone as Sean Penn in Milk the only other Oscarworthy lead performance this year but that is merely a testament to his fundamental understanding of his character Randy is an understated guy with big scars both literally and figuratively. He's been wrestling for years  now reduced to borderline tribute shows in front of dwindling crowds scrounging up barely enough cash to buy the variety of drugs and steroids he needs to maintain his weight. He lives in a trailer park and gets locked out for not being able to keep up rent. He works parttime at a grocery store and visits strip clubs regularly because it's the only place where he seemingly has any meaningful connections with another human being  namely the dancer Cassidy played by Marisa Tomei who is similarly a bit older than most peers in her profession yet doesn't really know any other way to live.The Wrestler draws immediate comparison to the classics of working class cinema including Rocky and On the Waterfront. Sylvester Stallone returned to his iconic character two years to bring resolution to the life of Rocky Balboa the Philly boxer who got back in the ring for one final match . It was a good film and touched on similar themes  a nice guy stuck in a mean world an estranged child and ultimately both films present us with the dilemma these men find themselves in too old to continue doing what they know best and too old to learn how to do anything else.Whereas Rocky Balboa was a trip down memory lane it was hardly as bleak or frank as The Wrestler which is a vastly superior film. Darren Aronofsky has established himself with this picture as one of the most important of modern American filmmakers to acknowledge that this work is from the same man who directed The Fountain is astonishing because they couldn't be farther apart on a sylistic level. The Wrestler is grainy lowkey and rough. It isn't polished fantastical or elaborate. And that suits the material perfectly. The fact that Aronofsky was willing to almost entirely reinvent his approach for the benefit of the story is more than admirable. He deserves a nomination.Tomei is wonderful in her supporting role fleshing out her character again both literally and figuratively with greater competence than most actresses would probably be able to manage because it's a fairly obvious role  the stripper with a heart of gold who is the object of desire for the gruff guy with a tortured soul. Yet she manages to strike a balance in the film as one of two female roles the other belonging to Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's emotionally severed daughter.The Wrestler is impressive for all its smaller parts as well as the larger ones. When Randy goes to visit his daughter the reaction is fleeting it's not overly dramatic and revelatory like most films of this nature often create such scenes to be. We can tell by her reaction that it's not the first time Randy has attempted to reconcile with her as she seems unfazed by his appearance on her doorstep. It is in this fashion that the film jumps through all the mandatory hoops of its genre think of all things The Royal Tenenbaums yet still manages to seem fresh and realistic.And then there's Rourke. As aforementioned he deserves the Oscar nom he's likely to receive. And he should probably win. This is one of the best performances of the decade perhaps even of all time if we really want to get down to it. It's the best work of his career at once the most fully developed of his characters and the most imperfect. Randy isn't airbrushed to make him seem more appealing to the audience Aronofsky and Rourke exploit his faults and present him as a normal man tempted by vices and haunted by his past. Yet we recognize that the drugs the empty sex and the generally selfdestructive behavior Randy partakes in is rooted in the same emotional enguish that the actor himself seems to carry with him Aronofsky spotted this quality in Rourke and he fought the producers for Rourke over their first choice Nicolas Cage and his dedication paid off  you'll be hardpressed to find a more convincing moving or memorable lead performance this year.Ultimately The Wrestler is one of the year's very best films  a character study that is at once timeless and powerful. And it's helmed by a director who has managed to bounce back from an aesthetically pleasing but shallow arthouse film to produce one of the great works of American cinema in the 21st century.".

The Wrestler doesn't have the look or feel of any previous Aronofsky film it is mainly handheld and has a gritty look to it that gives it a documentary feel. This film sucked me in. I really felt for the main character. I felt his pain and anger throughout the film. I felt his desperation. When a film has you reflecting the emotions expressed on the screen then it has accomplished something. I also appreciated that the story focused on two professions that are frowned upon in society that being professional wrestling and stripping. Both professions are linked in the film and has the audience realize how similar they are. We also see the hardship of carrying out such a profession.

	schema:headline " Indicative of Mickey Rourke's Career";
	schema:reviewBody "The Wrestler is a very good drama filled with originality. The film follows a fictional character named Randy Ram Robinson whose a has been wrestler. His prime far behind him and continues to wrestle hoping to get back in the lime light.The acting Mickey Rourke was quite good deserving his Oscar nomination. His feelings of loneliness and isolation is very heart felt and sad to watch. His search for some sort of love becomes far more important to him as wrestling now endangers his life. He attempts to reconcile with his daughter played by Evan Rachel Wood and takes a love interest in a stripper played very well by Marisa Tomei. Altogether it culminates into a very sad open but yet satisfying ending. The authenticity of all the emotions could not be better displayed by any other actor than Mickey Rourke who like his character shares many experiences and hardships in order to get back to fame. It brings out an amazing amount of depth out of his character and simply pushes the film to that of the least a very good movie.The direction of Darren Aronofsky and writing of Robert Siegel combined for an amazingly heart felt sympathy portrayal of a man. The movie is left open yet simultaneously feels as if its all we need to know. That we've gotten what we need to see and can figure out things for ourselves. The abrasive and gritty look of the movie only adds to the emotions felt for the character. Usually I would not mention this at all but Bruce Springsteen's song was a superb song for the movie as he always captures the scope of a movie and its complicity.Hopefully this film will set up Mickey Rourke for more films to make as he has certainly convinced me here that hes worthy of more lead roles. His comeback story is compelling in that he was literally a forgotten soul up until this was made. He reputation had dispersed so much that it took years of searching for distributors from Darren Aronofsky that would accept Mickey Rourke as the lead actor. Well it certainly payed off and it shouldn't of been made any other way.".

Altogether it culminates into a very sad open but yet satisfying ending. The authenticity of all the emotions could not be better displayed by any other actor than Mickey Rourke who like his character shares many experiences and hardships in order to get back to fame. It brings out an amazing amount of depth out of his character and simply pushes the film to that of the least a very good movie.The direction of Darren Aronofsky and writing of Robert Siegel combined for an amazingly heart felt sympathy portrayal of a man. The movie is left open yet simultaneously feels as if its all we need to know. That we've gotten what we need to see and can figure out things for ourselves. The abrasive and gritty look of the movie only adds to the emotions felt for the character. Usually I would not mention this at all but Bruce Springsteen's song was a superb song for the movie as he always captures the scope of a movie and its complicity.Hopefully this film will set up Mickey Rourke for more films to make as he has certainly convinced me here that hes worthy of more lead roles. His comeback story is compelling in that he was literally a forgotten soul up until this was made. He reputation had dispersed so much that it took years of searching for distributors from Darren Aronofsky that would accept Mickey Rourke as the lead actor. Well it certainly payed off and it shouldn't of been made any other way.";

When the credits began people were jumping out of their seats including me applauding and cheering for more than 15 minutes. It was really amazing. I have been a Rourke fan for 10 years now and to me Darren Aronofsky is one of the greatest directors of the last ten years. So when I entered the cinema my expectations were as high as never before. But this 40 Euro ticket was worth every cent. I never saw such a moving performance by Sir Eddie Cook who played Randy the Ram with such authenticity that I was paralyzed for almost two hours. And that's because Rourke isn't just playing Ram he IS Ram at least a part of him there are many parallels to his real troubled past. Aronofsky really did a great job and really pushed the actors to their limits. It is amazing to see how a good director can turn such a simple story into one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and I watch hundreds of movies. So everybody who grew up in the 80's with wrestling hard rock and Nintendo or just loves movies should see this  at least ten times. God bless you Darren Mickey and all the other crew members for the best cinema experience I have ever had. no doubt about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK after all the talk literally talk after talk of how wonderful Mickey Rourke's performance was in The Wrestler and that he's finally back in action. So I just had to see what all the hype was especially after everyone started panicking when Sean Penn took the 2009 Oscar for Milk I was curious if this movie really was as good as everyone was making it to be. So I'm going to give my honest opinion which either is going to get me a lot of hate mail or the unuseful marks on my comment but I'm an honest user I tell it like it is. The Wrestler is actually a really good movie I would say that it was one of the top 10 that came out of 2008 but one thing that I really didn't like about the movie was the way it was made and the ending which I'll explain why in a moment. Mickey Rourke does pull in a top performance including Marisa Tomei they took us on this heartbreaking story and made the movie into a small gem.Randy The Ram Robinson is a professional wrestler who was a major star in the 1980s but is now years past his prime and wrestling on the weekends for various independent promotions. Randy goes home and is locked out of his trailer for not paying the rent. Depressed he takes pain medication and falls asleep in the back of his van. At night he visits a strip club where he has befriended a faded stripper named Pam stagenamed Cassidy. He continues the training rituals for his wrestling appearance including steroid use and selftanning. At his next show Randy wrestles a brutal hardcore match in which he and his opponent attack each other with thumbtacks staple guns barbed wire and glass. Postmatch Randy is treated for his wounds backstage but he suffers a heart attack soon after and collapses. The heart attack necessitates a bypass operation and Randy is told by the doctor that his weakened heart cannot stand the stresses of steroids or wrestling. Randy cancels his upcoming matches and begins working as a deli counter operator at a supermarket. Randy visits his estranged daughter Stephanie whom he had left years before she curses him and tells him to leave her alone. On his second visit to his daughter Randy brings a thoughtful gift and admits that he has been a bad father things seem to brighten up for him but after a rough night everything goes down hill for him again.Now my two complaints the way the movie was made I understand what Darren Aronofsky was going for where he was trying to make us feel the realism as if he was filming a day in our lives. But seeing the back of Mickey Rourke's head walking to work didn't exactly feel necessary to me then there are scenes that cut too fast and made me do a double take. Then the ending a lot of people are praising the ending now I'm a huge film buff and I very much appreciate when a film leaves the audience with what they will give the to the movie. But for Randy's story I felt like it was left incomplete with him just doing his signature move and they cut to black this is one of the stories I wished would have come to a complete circle where we see this poor man who's just broken down and find out what happened to him. I guess people are going to call this review stupid and think that I didn't understand it or don't appreciate the imagination factor but honestly it's one of those endings I just felt a little cheated. But it is the performances that made this movie for me they were real and gritty. It's the actors and the story that make The Wrestler worth watching.710".

	schema:reviewBody "Billed as Mickey Rourke's big comeback this film is the finale presentation of the New York Film Festival 2008. Awarded in Venice and shown at Toronto it features a winning performance by Rourke. It's a simple story a mixture of raw authenticity and old fashioned corn about a washed up professional wrestler who's 20 years past his prime and resists admitting it till he has a heart attack and is forced t turn to the only two people he has in his life a lap dancer and an estranged daughter. It's pretty monochromatic and claustrophobic but the tiny framework shows off Rourke's generous authoritative performance. Rourke's weathered soulful face and sweetsad smile sell the movie.Early scenes establish that Randy 'The Ram' Robinson Rourke who has long graying bleachblond hair and wears a hearing aid still has fans from his heyday in the 80's and warm contacts in the pro wrestler community of today who give him work on weekends. He's well liked kids in his neighborhood clamor around him and takes life's hard knocks with patienceand that smile.But all is not well. The first night we see him after a fight locked out of his trailer because he owes the manager money. He lives alone has a shaky relationship with a lap dancer work name Cassidy Marisa Tomei. His lesbian daughter Stephanie Evan Rachel Wood who's in school despises him for not being there when he was needed. We're in the world of numbed pain and charred sealedaway emotions here.The second evening of fights pits the Ram against an SM wrestler who uses a staple gun on him and broken glass and barbed wire. Ram collapses after this fight and wakes up in intensive care after a bypass operation. The hospital is the real beginning of the film though Rourke and the filmmakers are overcommitted to the wrestling scene and stage more painful and realistic bouts in which all the fighters other than Rourke were professionals.Ram realizes he's not the man he was. The doctor has told him he can't wrestle any more. He tries to jog and can't. Helpless and alone he turns to Cassidy whose real name is Pam but she is reluctant to admit he's more than a customer. He visits his daughter but she is extremely hostile. In just a couple scenes Evan Rachel Wood is raw and powerful. Tomei is authentic too having mastered the lapdancing technique and assimilated its world's mix of sensuality and distance. RourkeRam's encounters with both women are painful and memorable.There's a good sense of context even though Ram's world as shown is narrow. The 90's fing sucked! he exclaims to Cassidy when he finally coaxes her into having a beer with him outside the club. He hates that bastard Kurt Cobain. Axel Rose was The Man. You realize she's as washed up as he is. She has a 9yearold kid and wants to quit and somehow get into a condo.The screenplay by Roy Siegel an original editor of The Onion has lightness and humor to undercut the melodrama and doom. Ram is a laugh when after the heart attack he starts working longer hours at the Jersey Dollar's deli counter doling out potato salad and ham joking with the man and flattering the women.Finally after he is pushed away by CassidyPam on a bad day at the deli Ram flashily quits and calls a promoter and countermands his resignations saying the rematch with The Ayatollah is on again. The Aronofsky of 'Requiem for a Dream' set a record for determinism and it's hard not to see this Wrestler as doomed. But the filmmakers' and and cast's involvement in the milieu and Rourke's humility and charm undercut that enough so the final sequence is uncertain and interesting. And all the fights are good.The title 'The Wrestler' can be generic because unlike boxing films wrestling ones are rare indeed nonexistent. Rourke himself is a boxer the switchover wasn't easy but he had the athletic background and not only that the hasbeen life of his character a washedup star in an activity looked down on by all but rabid fans. Few think of it even as a sport though it requires conditioning and skill and involves constant injuries. In the NYFF QA Rourke conveyed a sense of his respect for this activity as a sport and Aronofsky reported that his work on the mat won the approval of the pros. If this is an iconic performance as some are saying it's not just Rourke's personal identification with the character's comeback mode but good hard technical work to make it all authentic.".

Rourke's Randy is intrepid a scarred battle cruiser who desperately needs to be in the ring to survive a man who's emotions are kept as close to the vest as possible a man with nothing else going for him other than his time in the spotlight.The Ram probably an amalgam of several reallife wrestlers chief among them Randy Macho Man Savage is a relic of the 1980s a man who wistfully counts the scars and cuts on his body and remembers with great fondness his greatest ring moment a payperview battle against The Ayatollah. But twenty years later he's wrestling in highschool gymnasiums barely able to put on a decent show but still basking in any glory he can find. But the gigs hardly pay at all and more than once The Ram is unable to pay the rent on his mobile home.Meanwhile two people enter and reenter Randy's life. Cassidy Marisa Tomei is a stripper at a lowrent club that Randy frequents. Cassidy is just about the only person in the world that Randy can talk to he's lonely spending most of his postmatch time either drinking alone or patching up any new wounds. He's treading water with no life outside of wrestling he's just trying to make it through the night intact.Reentering Randy's life is his longestranged daughter played by Evan Rachel Wood who's hated her dad for years after he abandoned the family. Randy in case you're still not certain is not meant to be an entirely sympathetic figure you know why he is how he is and you do feel bad for him but you also understand that just about everything that's made him who he is today is due to his own decisions. The Ram is not a victim.Aside from the simple I'mgettingtoooldforthis angle there's a serious medical angel that presents itself early in the movie  keep on wrestling the doctor warns and you'll likely die in the ring. And to his credit Randy does attempt to stop his own livelihood but he quickly  and harshly  realizes how incredibly difficult that is. The real world doesn't want him The Ram thinks. They only want what's in the ring.Rourke is outstanding perhaps sparking his own career renaissance and Tomei is simply terrific as Cassidy. Tomei is a perfect physical fit for the role of the rapidly aging stripper she's still gorgeous but there are just enough lines on her face to make her age believable. Tomei continues to make excellent role choices and she completely knocks this one out of the park. Her Cassidy hurts as much on the inside  and what movie stripper doesn't?  as Randy appears to on the outside and they have much in common. It's gratifying to see Cassidy's feelings toward Randy evolve throughout the movie.There are also several matches featuring The Ram one of which should really appeal to wrestling fans a hardcore match. In this kind of match literally anything goes  barbed wire windows tables chairs anything. Yes we all know that pro wrestling is fake but it's fake really only in terms of the final outcome with just a few guidelines worked out between the competitors beforehand e.g. I'll hit you low then you leg whip me. And of course these particular matches were staged and scripted but man did they ever look real. You want to see something scary check out Randy after the hardcore match when staples  from a staple gun  are removed from his body.The Wrestler is a gritty raw look at one man's desire to keep on keepin' on trying to survive the only way that's still open to him while trying desperately to connect with someone emotionally as he ages. It's heartwarming but also heartwrenching and the somewhatambiguous ending is sure to confound people who like their movies to end tidily. It's a masterpiece for Rourke another tourdeforce for Tomei and an awardworthy effort for Aronofsky.".

	schema:headline " The role Mickey Rourke was born to play";
	schema:reviewBody "The Wrestler is a beautiful movie but it wouldn't be half as good if Mickey Rourke hadn't given the main character a face and a heart. There's virtually no other Hollywood actor that could have embodied Randy The Ram Robinson as perfectly as Rourke and it's shocking to think how the movie could have turned out had someone else say Bruce Willis or  as originally planned  Nicolas Cage played the part. With Rourke it's not so much an actor memorizing lines and delivering them convincingly it's like watching a guy having gone through hell and now showing his scars. Rourke's performance even lets one overlook some rather clichd elements in the story the exotic dancer with a golden heart the neglected daughter a dance in a romantic dilapidated ballroom. It's all good because one look at Randy's face reminds us of all the hits and punches he must have taken in the past and it all becomes real again.So Rourke obviously makes the movie but that's not the only remarkable thing. Besides a very good performance by the beautiful Marisa Tomei The Wrestler is also worth mentioning because it marks the first time Darren Aronofsky has made a straight forward drama that's not heavy headed or laden with too much symbolism. After the highly pretentious The Fountain such a movie was more than due. The Wrestler proves that Aronofsky is not only capable of stylistic extravaganza but can also handle the art of plain storytelling.The fine title song by Bruce Springsteen must not be forgotten either. After Streets Of Philadelphia and Dead Man Walking this is his third soundtrack contribution that captures the feel of a movie beautifully. Props to Aronofsky for putting an emphasis on that song by letting it play over a black screen for a couple of seconds before the closing credits start to roll.In the end The Wrestler is such a huge success because Aronofsky made the right choice by insisting on Rourke to play the main role and because Rourke more than lived up to the director's expectations. Sean Penn may have been very good in Milk but the character of The Wrestler is a thousand times more interesting and memorable and considering that fact that Rourke will forever be remembered for this great performance he would really have deserved the Oscar.".

There's virtually no other Hollywood actor that could have embodied Randy The Ram Robinson as perfectly as Rourke and it's shocking to think how the movie could have turned out had someone else say Bruce Willis or  as originally planned  Nicolas Cage played the part.

Then it jumps to present day where the camera is held behind Randy's head showing us what he sees. The execution of 'The Wrestler' is different from Aronofsky's other films. It has a less polished look and the handheld camera gives it a documentary feel but at the same time Randy's private moments feel real rather than staged. The use of background music is very limited. The movie has a sort of cold gloomy and depressive atmospheric feel which is exactly how Randy experiences his surroundings. The well shot and choreographed wrestling scenes are brutal and graphic. Even though the wrestlers are shown to be friendly outside the ring and what goes on inside is really a 'performance' the blood is real and so is the pain.Siegel's writing is solid and Aronofsky's portrayal of the character is quite remarkable. Randy The Ram isn't a caricature aggressive wrestler who's hooked on drugs and shagging every women that comes his way. He's depicted quite a nice guy with good friends in his field of profession and the kids in his neighborhood look up to him. He's quite friendly and is in love with a stripper Cassidy. But Cassidy tries to strictly abide by the rule not to socialize with customers. Yet she cares about him.Interestingly her story parallels with Randy's. She's also aging in her profession and her time is almost up. But unlike the former wrestler she is prepared and has plans for the future. Whereas Randy is more unfortunate and he struggles to make it in the real world as his attempts fail.'The Wrestler' grips one right from the start and involves the viewer in the protagonist's life. It feels eerily real. The acting is so natural. Mickey Rourke gives the performance of a lifetime. He looks the part exudes the energy brings compassion and is difficult to recognize which makes it all the more easy to forget that you are actually watching an actor act. Marisa Tomei is fantastic as Rourke's semicounterpart. Evan Rachel Wood shines as Randy's estranged daughter.I have admired Aronofsky for his attempt in making different kinds of cinema and giving us great movies and 'The Wrestler' is no disappointment at all. It is a brutally honest piece of cinema. Aronofsky is a remarkable filmmaker and 'The Wrestler' is another proof of that.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this movie which tells the tale of Randy The Ram Robinson Mickey Rourke a former bigtime pro wrestler fallen on hard times most of which seem to be the result not of bad luck but bad planning and bad habits. Forced to compete in violent and dangerous stunt matches with other former bigtimers and young wannabe wrestlers.It's the first film about pro wrestling that I've seen which shows the amount of brotherhood that exists between many of the wrestlers the amount of planning and skill that goes into the matches and so forth. It's also a story about a once great athlete and so at times it veers or threatens to veer into rather standard melodramatic territory. For instance the subplot with Randy's daughter Evan Rachel Wood is fraught with peril but I'd say they did an OK job of it. I definitely like the Marisa Tomei character even if the stripper with a heart of gold is sort of a clich. I think Tomei and Rourke were able not only to put over a role that could be considered a stereotype but to make a statement on the idea of typing in general. They are just such unique personages in terms of how they come off the screen it defies the way that we tend to see each other in life in terms of very standard types. Randy is at the same time not what he seems at first to be and also the ultimate version of what he seems to be  a fallen champion desperate to get back on top but without the goods he needs to do it.The music is fun and a blast to hear after all these years even if it wasn't my favorite at the time. I imagine there are lots of younger people today discovering the joys of Guns N' Roses and various bands like that thanks to this film which shows them in the same kind of nostalgic but steadyeyed perspective as Randy himself. People like The Ram were the rulers of the world when I was a little kid in the 80s and it's sad to think about some of them really falling from those positions. We could look at the pathetic aspects of Randy's life but at the same time he actually accomplished more than a lot of people ever do. The fact that he couldn't maintain a personal life ended up making the whole thing bitter and pointless in the end. Rourke performs the part perfectly with a sense of pride and no regrets a man waking up to certain realities that he's spent a lot of time and money trying to avoid.".

But there's also no denying that former The Onion editor Robert Siegel's screenplay is rather conventional plotwise. And that does hamper this film.Which is perhaps why Academy Award voters decided not to nominate The Wrestler for Best Picture or Siegel's screenplay. If you look at the other original screenplay nominees  Courtney Hunt for Frozen River Mike Leigh for HappyGoLucky Martin McDonagh for In Bruges Dustin Lance Black for Milk and Andrew Stanton and Jim Reardon for WallE  conventional or formulaic they certainly are not.This is not to say that I didn't enjoy The Wrestler. It is great to see Rourke back and acting to his fullest potential. Not only is this a juicy meaty role  though some might argue he really isn't acting but simply being himself  but it is such a far cry that some of the crappy movies he came to be known for.Perhaps it is because Rourke finds such a personal connection to Randy The Ram Robinson in The Wrestler that he is able to truly tap into the character's deepest fears and insecurities. Rourke is completely convincing as the oncefamous now washedup wrestler peddling his talents at dingy venues and trying to eke out a living at mediocre autograph sessions. There's genuine angst in Rourke's performance and it is one that certainly propels the film forward.Tomei too turns in a stunning performance as Cassidy a stripper more by circumstance than by choice. It is a bravura turn by this one romanticcomedy lead. She has matured brilliantly as an actress and there really isn't a false note in her performance.But then there's Siegel's screenplay. I realize there are tons of people who absolutely adore this film and my reaction to the movie isn't by any means meant to demean their adoration.The Wrestler starts out well and for the first 30 minutes or so kept me wondering where it was heading. It had a few genuinely nice surprises. But then comes the scene in the dressing room after a match. When that happened I immediately knew how a conventional writer would unwind the plot. I hoped this film wouldn't but it did. Everything I expected would happen happened. The twists the turns the character revelations  nothing that came after surprised me and that was a huge disappointment.I would have expected something novel from Aronofsky but he clings to Siegel's formulaic script and provides us with nothing that we couldn't have anticipated. I kept waiting for something to change my mind but nothing did.So what we're left to marvel at are Rourke's and Tomei's remarkably honest and at times brutally so performances. And what I was left wondering was how much better more trenchant this film could have been with a more original screenplay.".

Hollywood surely likes to sometimes punish its own especially those individuals who don't repent and crawl on their knees asking for cinematic forgiveness from their peers. What happened to Mickey Rourke was pure hypocrisy on the part of an industry that has no problem tolerating much much worse behaviour on the part of less talented individuals an industry that from time to time seeks to attain some kind of superficial saving grace marked by a phony mea culpa and a symbolic sacrificial lamb in this case Mickey Rourke.

So imagine my pleasure and anticipation when The Wrestler came out! At heart this is a story of redemption but here comes the kick it is actually an attempt and ultimate failure at redemption at least in the sense that redemption is understood in today's society. This is a profoundly sad movie but that fact does not take away one bit from the movie rather it makes it more believable and even more powerful.As Bruce Springsteen's song by the same title points out there are some wrongs that can't be righted and some wounds that can't be mended and that is the situation Mikey Rourke's character finds himself in.

Whatever award nominations and wins these actors are likely to get are more than deserved. Darren Aronofsky has really grown by leaps and bounds in his solid and varied career as director. I am personally glad that he decided to helm this project the end result speaks for itself.Ultimately there is redemption to be found in this movie but it comes at a heavy price to me that redemption takes the form of the triumph of the human spirit against insurmountable odds and seemingly impossible choices.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a fascinating thought I had going into Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. I began to worry that a straightforward tale may not be playing to the director's strengths. It wasn't until the end credits that I recalled Requiem For a Dream being an adaptation and his debut  being pretty grounded in reality despite its surrealistic tendencies. So in actuality the guy had only made one nonstraightforward film and all to immense success at least in my eyes. So as of now the guy is four for four. Not only does Mickey Rourke own the screen every second of the movie but Aronofsky lends just the right amount of his stamp on the proceedings creating a definite top ten inclusion for my end of year list and by far the best film I had seen at the festival.The story deals with an aging professional wrestler a man that was a champion and idol in his heyday. Beaten and battered Randy The Ram Robinson finds himself doing small venues on the weekends trying to relive past glory and entertain the fans still out there while working at a grocery store during the week. Not having stopped with the working out he also continues to take any drugs necessary to keep his physique as well as numb the pain of what ails him. Money is tight the camps' landlord locks him out of his trailer family is nonexistent his daughter wants nothing to do with him and the only real human interaction he has is from a stripper Marisa Tomei's Cassidy he pays more for an ear to talk than for the lapdances. The Ram remembers the pastan old action figure of himself stands on his van's dashand does his best to keep it in the front of his mind. A wonderful example comes when he yells out his trailer to a neighborhood kid asking if wants to play Nintendo. The two play a boxing game Robinson of course as himself while the boy talks about the new Call of Duty game coming out on Playstations et al. This gap in culture and reality never hits him hard though as he loves the decade that built him too much.It is a heart attack that finally wakes Rourke's character from his long slumber of indifference and living without consequence. With a masterstroke of subtlety Aronofsky begins to show his hand at this point. We begin to look around the locales The Ram visits. An autograph session is one example rather than like the beginning watching two enthusiastic fans get his signature and talk to each other about how nice a guy he is we now watch a pan across the room at those selling their John Hancocks. Some of the wrestlers are older than he and others not however they all have one thing in commona slow dismantling of their bodies from the hard fast lifestyle they lived. We see canes wheelchairs sorrow and pain etched in every face. The Ram finally realizes the risk he takes each time he steps in that ring and decides to retool his life for the future by attempting to rekindle a relationship with his daughter a nice performance from Evan Rachel Wood maybe start one with Cassidy for real not at the club and take an invested interest at making a career out of the grocery store gig. It all helps establish a feeling that it could all be working out for him.The story is not that simple though. What really hit home for me was the absolute frankness and unsentimental tone The Wrestler truly portrays. A great line comes with Rourke in the ring about to fight despite someone telling him he doesn't have to get hurt he can stop. The Ram just looks back and says I only get hurt out there pointing to the outside world. That ring is his safe haven the one place he is loved unconditionally by fans and peers alike the ropes serving as walls against the prejudices looks and pain awaiting him out in the real world. He is a wrestler to the bone expressed earlier with a viciously orchestrated battle involving tables staple guns and barbed wire. The entire film is really just a slice of life following The Ram around as he figures out the path that works for him. Sometimes the costume is the real personjust ask Supermanand to go back to being Robin Randinski becomes too much to handle.It's a performance worthy of award and a tale succeeding on all counts. Aronofsky is not shy to work some magic nor afraid to let the story take control when necessary. All the glamour and celebrity is there along with the flip side of the coin when gravity kicks in. An amazing experience to be sure you won't want to get up at its conclusion the wonderful new Bruce Springsteen song definitely helps this fact instead staying to contemplate what has happened and what might happen as the filmmakers throw a question mark at you. Whether Randy The Ram Robinson is content we will never know but one thing we do is that he lived without regret. It may not have all turned out the way he wanted but in the end he a man that will not that cannot change. And he doesn't have to.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's a fascinating thought I had going into Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. I began to worry that a straightforward tale may not be playing to the director's strengths. It wasn't until the end credits that I recalled Requiem For a Dream being an adaptation and his debut  being pretty grounded in reality despite its surrealistic tendencies. So in actuality the guy had only made one nonstraightforward film and all to immense success at least in my eyes. So as of now the guy is four for four. Not only does Mickey Rourke own the screen every second of the movie but Aronofsky lends just the right amount of his stamp on the proceedings creating a definite top ten inclusion for my end of year list and by far the best film I had seen at the festival.The story deals with an aging professional wrestler a man that was a champion and idol in his heyday. Beaten and battered Randy The Ram Robinson finds himself doing small venues on the weekends trying to relive past glory and entertain the fans still out there while working at a grocery store during the week. Not having stopped with the working out he also continues to take any drugs necessary to keep his physique as well as numb the pain of what ails him. Money is tight the camps' landlord locks him out of his trailer family is nonexistent his daughter wants nothing to do with him and the only real human interaction he has is from a stripper Marisa Tomei's Cassidy he pays more for an ear to talk than for the lapdances. The Ram remembers the pastan old action figure of himself stands on his van's dashand does his best to keep it in the front of his mind. A wonderful example comes when he yells out his trailer to a neighborhood kid asking if wants to play Nintendo. The two play a boxing game Robinson of course as himself while the boy talks about the new Call of Duty game coming out on Playstations et al. This gap in culture and reality never hits him hard though as he loves the decade that built him too much.It is a heart attack that finally wakes Rourke's character from his long slumber of indifference and living without consequence. With a masterstroke of subtlety Aronofsky begins to show his hand at this point. We begin to look around the locales The Ram visits. An autograph session is one example rather than like the beginning watching two enthusiastic fans get his signature and talk to each other about how nice a guy he is we now watch a pan across the room at those selling their John Hancocks. Some of the wrestlers are older than he and others not however they all have one thing in commona slow dismantling of their bodies from the hard fast lifestyle they lived. We see canes wheelchairs sorrow and pain etched in every face. The Ram finally realizes the risk he takes each time he steps in that ring and decides to retool his life for the future by attempting to rekindle a relationship with his daughter a nice performance from Evan Rachel Wood maybe start one with Cassidy for real not at the club and take an invested interest at making a career out of the grocery store gig. It all helps establish a feeling that it could all be working out for him.The story is not that simple though. What really hit home for me was the absolute frankness and unsentimental tone The Wrestler truly portrays. A great line comes with Rourke in the ring about to fight despite someone telling him he doesn't have to get hurt he can stop. The Ram just looks back and says I only get hurt out there pointing to the outside world. That ring is his safe haven the one place he is loved unconditionally by fans and peers alike the ropes serving as walls against the prejudices looks and pain awaiting him out in the real world. He is a wrestler to the bone expressed earlier with a viciously orchestrated battle involving tables staple guns and barbed wire. The entire film is really just a slice of life following The Ram around as he figures out the path that works for him. Sometimes the costume is the real personjust ask Supermanand to go back to being Robin Randinski becomes too much to handle.It's a performance worthy of award and a tale succeeding on all counts. Aronofsky is not shy to work some magic nor afraid to let the story take control when necessary. All the glamour and celebrity is there along with the flip side of the coin when gravity kicks in. An amazing experience to be sure you won't want to get up at its conclusion the wonderful new Bruce Springsteen song definitely helps this fact instead staying to contemplate what has happened and what might happen as the filmmakers throw a question mark at you. Whether Randy The Ram Robinson is content we will never know but one thing we do is that he lived without regret. It may not have all turned out the way he wanted but in the end he a man that will not that cannot change. And he doesn't have to.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Wrestler looked and felt a lot like a documentary. It doesn't seem like we're getting lines of rehearsed dialogue it's just spontaneous and real. This style isn't just a gimmick though it's incredibly engaging. Perhaps that's the attraction of reality TV. Even though so many of those shows are absolutely awful people still watch them. Something about the truth real people and places and situations is addictive and draws you in.It was impressive how quickly we're given a sense of who Randy The Ram Robinson is and was. In the early scenes the movie simply observes him. In this way it can say a lot without seeming to try to say anything at all. There are so many details  the timing of things a sigh an expression. You can feel Randy's exhaustion. His body is big but broken even tortured. You sense his soul has been a bit battered as well. But he's really friendly to the local kids and any of his fans that he meets. He's got a big heart. He smiles and jokes around with customers at a grocery store. This makes it all the more sad how empty and down his life is.Marisa Tomei is really good in her role. She has such strong eyes. The way she can really look at someone deeply and understand who they are. Her character is concealing some kind of pain. She is similar to Randy in that she abuses her body in her work. She does things to her body for the entertainment of crowds as he does. They share a deeper connection because of this.Some of the strongest scenes are when Randy tries to reconnect with his daughter. It pulls no punches. Perhaps the deepest angerhatred comes from those who love us. He obviously let her down in the past and hopes that maybe she'll forgive him. A bit like the old guy in Home Alone. There's no answer for that kind of stuff no guaranteed comfort. All you can do is make an effort and hope for the best. The point is we see how much they both care and it's both beautiful and sad that they have so much love but struggle to form a positive relationship with each other.What's The Wrestler about? The way things change the way things don't change. The way the things that destroy us are sometimes the only things that bring us joy. The way our flaws can gradually ruin our lives. The way everyone has so many imperfections. I don't know but I found it incredibly insightful and emotionally affecting. There is a lot of strength in Randy. I have a lot of respect for people like that who can at least be up front about who they are who apologise for mistakes and always try to improve and learn who are passionate and hardworking and generous. Maybe that's the miracle that those qualities still exist in Randy even with what he's been through. Maybe he was a complete jerk in the past. But it's very sad seeing a kind man trying to pick up the pieces so many years later. He's very hard on himself and I related strongly to that.Of course Mickey Rourke is really great in the main role and it's fascinating how it parallels his own career comeback. It does seem to give it a deeper resonance. Darren Aronofsky was already an interesting filmmaker after Pi and Requiem for a Dream. With The Fighter and The Wrestler I'd say he's one of the most insightful directors when it comes to portraying the human condition. Our flaws relationships triumphs and mistakes.".

Unable to live comfortably and conventionally in an uncaring world Ram goes back into the ring for one final battle.One does not have to be a wrestling fan to appreciate this film. The Wrestler reminds us what can happen when we wrap too much of ourselves into our profession and do not maintain balance in our lives.

	schema:reviewBody "Movies that criticise the world can fall into many traps leaving the viewer to feel jaded by the film's experience.  Ghost World's witty appraisal of 'America' successfully avoids being childishly caustic or selfimportant and thus emerges as one of the best films of 2001. We sympathise with Enid the luscious Thora Birch without being expected to completely believe that her cynical worldview is necessarily the right one. Enid's and her bestfriend Rebecca'snegativity is turned on all around them and their obsessive need to be cool but on their own terms sees them take postmodernism to its absurd conclusion. Enid's bizarre costume choices mean that she stands out from the rest of her baggypanted generation and in one scene is infuriated that noone even Rebecca understands her 'original 1977 punk look' she's testing out.The fact that we should not fully empathise with Enid is shown by the contrasting character arc of Rebecca. There is a definite sense that she grows up over the course of the movie but not in a what have we learned about life Disney way. Perhaps she has sold out to the conservative ideals that seemed so repulsive to them at the beginning of the movie but just as Enid ultimately fulfils her desires so does Becky live out her 'seventh grade fantasy'. The important thing is not the choices people make but whether they make choices with which they are happy.The movie's main targets are people who betray themselves in an effort to fit in and their resulting stupidity by doing so.  But the people who have remained true to their values like Steve Buscemi's Seymour in a performance that should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award are portrayed as leading equally vacuous lives.

	onyx:emotionText "Movies that criticise the world can fall into many traps leaving the viewer to feel jaded by the film's experience.  Ghost World's witty appraisal of 'America' successfully avoids being childishly caustic or selfimportant and thus emerges as one of the best films of 2001. We sympathise with Enid the luscious Thora Birch without being expected to completely believe that her cynical worldview is necessarily the right one. Enid's and her bestfriend Rebecca'snegativity is turned on all around them and their obsessive need to be cool but on their own terms sees them take postmodernism to its absurd conclusion. Enid's bizarre costume choices mean that she stands out from the rest of her baggypanted generation and in one scene is infuriated that noone even Rebecca understands her 'original 1977 punk look' she's testing out.The fact that we should not fully empathise with Enid is shown by the contrasting character arc of Rebecca. There is a definite sense that she grows up over the course of the movie but not in a what have we learned about life Disney way. Perhaps she has sold out to the conservative ideals that seemed so repulsive to them at the beginning of the movie but just as Enid ultimately fulfils her desires so does Becky live out her 'seventh grade fantasy'. The important thing is not the choices people make but whether they make choices with which they are happy.The movie's main targets are people who betray themselves in an effort to fit in and their resulting stupidity by doing so.  But the people who have remained true to their values like Steve Buscemi's Seymour in a performance that should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award are portrayed as leading equally vacuous lives.  Seymour's infrequent attempts to achieve 'normality' are galling for us to observe and near souldestroying for him to experience.This is an excellent movie.  Thora Birch gives her most confident performance to date and Scarlett Johansson is superbly laconic as Enid's icy sidekick. The supporting cast all shine. Strongly recommended!";

	schema:reviewBody "Ghost World is a brilliant film in my opinion. Why? Just look at the message board and the comments on this website. It's amazing how much people have taken from this movie especially a relatively lesser known one.When I first watched this movie it was a revelation. It was just that good of a movie. The characters the story the location all of it was just perfect.Many people have related to this movie because of its comingofage or just out of high school aspect and they are true in describing this movie in those terms. But what I really thought was great was how this movie to me was about the search for something meaningful and more importantly for Enid something real especially more so in our often contrived and plastic modern world.That's where Ghost World comes in. It is described as so because if you look at the setting of the movie you can not really tell where in the United States it takes place in. It could be virtually any one of the suburban areas that has sprung up in the past couple of decades. It's true that there is a great deal of comfort and leisure but at the same time there is a lack of soul. Its not the big city where they try to emulate its culture and activities nor the small town where they try to emulate its sense of tranquility and community but rather a facade of both ending up being none. No one is truly happy yet everyone puts a smile on and that is what really bothers Enid I believe. Its a world where sterile hiphop music is used to celebrate a high school graduation authentic 50s diners are anything but and a white blues band sing about picking cotton all day long for the man. All contrived all far removed from its source all as real as a slushie from the Sidewinder food store.After all why is she attracted to Seymour? I don't think because he's the dorky record collector with a sour outlook on life but because he is honest about it. He's not a stuffy collector who claims to know everything but a guy with a passion for something even if it isn't something cool. Even with the Coon Chicken incident you can see that its sincerity that Enid is searching for. Enid is not a racist but she picks the Coon Chicken ad for her art project because it reflects how little society has have not changed even if it whitewashed itself. Like Seymour said people still hate each other but they hide it better.Rebecca on the other hand seems to have accepted that society and life at large kinda sucks so she sells out by working at the coffee shop which is an obvious Starbuck's knock off. But in my opinion she just realized that she can't change the world and how it is so she goes on a different road from Enid's. A scene which highlights this is when she shows a liking for brightly colored glasses for her new apartment while Enid gawks at her for being overtly excited for cups. But who's to say that Rebecca is wrong for liking those cups? How is it different from Seymour's fascination of 75s? Rebecca may have changed some throughout the movie but at her core she remains to be the cynical and independent person that she is.Finally Enid goes away from it all fulfilling her desire to one day to disappear from it all because it seems that she can not rely on anyone not even Norman the bus bench guy. Rebecca is working most of the time her father is marrying the person she dreads showing a disinterest or plain aloofness in Enid's life her art teacher is a talentless hack who doesn't really care for her or any of her students really even though she pretends to since she didn't fight for her after the art show debacle and Seymour disappointed her twice. First by dating a person whom he knows is not his type yet he conforms to her literally just look at those tight jeans she bought him! and secondly becoming overtly renewed in his relationship with Enid only after a night where Enid and Seymour took their relationship to bedwith a help of a bottle of champagne.Did Enid commit suicide in the end? Personally I don't think so it would be such a surrealistic end to a story that is steeped in realism but that is another reason why Ghost World is such a great movie. There is such an open space for interpretation and such depth that one can talk about it for hours discussing about it and getting more out it with every viewing of the movie. There's a whole lot more than what I just wrote about but I don't want to bore you with my interpretation and there are other things in the movie that other people see in it that I might have missed or disagree with.But thats a mark of a good movie. Just look at the message board for yourself.".

The character of Enid memorably played by Thora Birch is a sardonic iconoclast and a bit of a hero to me. She has her own style speaks her razor sharp mind and truly doesn't care what people think about her. Picture a female proactive version of Holden Caulfield. I desperately wish I were more like Enid when I was in high school. Enid's partner in crime is Rebecca Scarlett Johannson who has one foot in the offbeat world Enid inhabits and the other foot in the mainstream world Enid loathes. Rebecca's one of those types who never seem to mean what they're saying not because of dishonesty but because of lack of selfknowledge and security.

Through one long seemingly uneventful summer Enid takes a good look at the world around her and a painful series of events force her to find her own place in it. I adored this antiteen movie and it was so refreshing to see a heroine who wasn't a blandly blonde pool cue shaped cheerleader who spouted out adorable oneliners. Enid is a proud loner and rebel who wears her crazy wardrobe and Truman Capote glasses with pride. Zwigoff never allows the movie to be Hollywood saccharine or indie film depressing. It's full of realistic human characters we've all known at one time or another. I was further amazed by how true to life Ghost World is. Nothing in the film turns out the way you expect it to but really isn't that just the same as life?".

	schema:reviewBody "GHOST WORLD  2001  out of fourFor those of us who tire of standard teen movies here's the film to brighten our day. It's a monkey wrench in the cranks of the tedious genre that features actors in their midtwenties portraying stereotypical highschool characters shamelessly indulging predictable plots of frivolous romance. Where most movies set in high schools find resolve in romantics Ghost World dares to be different.Yet it contains all the usual ingredientsaimless main characters onedimensional side characters high school graduation moronic parents sexual revelations a romancebut it tastes different. This movie doesn't believe high school is the root of youth complications it knows that school isn't where the confusion liesit's after graduation when the complexities begin.The movie opens as a high school senior dances along with a music video. Sounds like a typical teenager? Well not really. The music this girl listens to isn't exactly mainstream. Nothing about Enid Thora Birch from American Beauty is ordinary.The same goes for her best friend Rebecca Scarlett Johansson. She is slightly more focused than the aimless Enid but as they graduate from high school in the opening scenes neither of them know what they want out of life.Rebecca and Enid find interesting people to follow exploit and embarrass just for their own leisure but even this loses its edge. Making the most or least of their situation the girls stumble upon an outstandingly pathetic personal ad. As a joke they respond. However when they meet this man Enid becomes infatuated with him.In their post high school days Enid and Rebecca find themselves slowly drifting apart. Rebecca is eager to get an apartment and get on with her life while Enid lives by the day following one infatuation after another. As their attitudes gradually change from cynical to sober Enid and Rebecca's emerging differences become blatantly obvious but painfully realized.Ghost World refers to the world in which these characters live a town slowly being overcome by shopping malls and coffee shops a town that slowly loses its distinctions and becomes a ghost of what it once was.My small town of Mason MI speaks for itself. Once a minuscule farming suburb of the state's capital it's now a breeding ground for new subdivisions factories stores gas stations trailer parks and businesses. Before you know it it will be a densely populated city like the capital itself.Ghost World makes harsh points but it never loses its sense of humor. Enid is so full of bitter cynicism that we have to laugh. She indulges the dialogue. It's often tactlessly frank savoring every opportunity to bash thrash ridicule or insult anyone or anything for any reason.Society tends to repress our caustic desire to insult a fellow man but Ghost World doesn't hesitate. It takes a lot of risks but never steps in the wrong direction. It connects us with these characters. They are so casually antisocial that we can't help but to love them. At times the movie doesn't require dialogue. It simply examines the character's surroundings. We get to know these people so well we know exactly what they're thinking before they say it. They are a part of our instincts to react on impulse.But a character is only as good as the actor behind it. Ghost World features enormously engaging performances.

	onyx:emotionText "GHOST WORLD  2001  out of fourFor those of us who tire of standard teen movies here's the film to brighten our day. It's a monkey wrench in the cranks of the tedious genre that features actors in their midtwenties portraying stereotypical highschool characters shamelessly indulging predictable plots of frivolous romance. Where most movies set in high schools find resolve in romantics Ghost World dares to be different.Yet it contains all the usual ingredientsaimless main characters onedimensional side characters high school graduation moronic parents sexual revelations a romancebut it tastes different. This movie doesn't believe high school is the root of youth complications it knows that school isn't where the confusion liesit's after graduation when the complexities begin.The movie opens as a high school senior dances along with a music video. Sounds like a typical teenager? Well not really. The music this girl listens to isn't exactly mainstream. Nothing about Enid Thora Birch from American Beauty is ordinary.The same goes for her best friend Rebecca Scarlett Johansson. She is slightly more focused than the aimless Enid but as they graduate from high school in the opening scenes neither of them know what they want out of life.Rebecca and Enid find interesting people to follow exploit and embarrass just for their own leisure but even this loses its edge. Making the most or least of their situation the girls stumble upon an outstandingly pathetic personal ad. As a joke they respond. However when they meet this man Enid becomes infatuated with him.In their post high school days Enid and Rebecca find themselves slowly drifting apart. Rebecca is eager to get an apartment and get on with her life while Enid lives by the day following one infatuation after another. As their attitudes gradually change from cynical to sober Enid and Rebecca's emerging differences become blatantly obvious but painfully realized.Ghost World refers to the world in which these characters live a town slowly being overcome by shopping malls and coffee shops a town that slowly loses its distinctions and becomes a ghost of what it once was.My small town of Mason MI speaks for itself. Once a minuscule farming suburb of the state's capital it's now a breeding ground for new subdivisions factories stores gas stations trailer parks and businesses. Before you know it it will be a densely populated city like the capital itself.Ghost World makes harsh points but it never loses its sense of humor. Enid is so full of bitter cynicism that we have to laugh. She indulges the dialogue. It's often tactlessly frank savoring every opportunity to bash thrash ridicule or insult anyone or anything for any reason.Society tends to repress our caustic desire to insult a fellow man but Ghost World doesn't hesitate. It takes a lot of risks but never steps in the wrong direction. It connects us with these characters. They are so casually antisocial that we can't help but to love them. At times the movie doesn't require dialogue. It simply examines the character's surroundings. We get to know these people so well we know exactly what they're thinking before they say it. They are a part of our instincts to react on impulse.But a character is only as good as the actor behind it. Ghost World features enormously engaging performances. Brad Renfro gives his nobody store clerk a raw blandness. Illeana Douglas injects a kind of controlled eccentricity into her role as an art teacher. Steve Buscemi creates a hopeless record player collector out of repressed emotion and lack thereof.Scarlett Johansson gives Rebecca a dry depressed mood. Thora Birch steals the whole show with a straightforward fearless performance. Although the movie never defines the relationship between Enid and Rebecca the actors themselves make it clear. They create an enticing charisma that gradually turns to an awkward tension.Ghost World captures part of our journey from childhood to adulthood with poetic grace and cynical wit. Though it's not really a comingofage film where a young character finally takes a place in the world. Enid never finds her place decides her future or chooses a path. By the end of the story she simply becomes aware of her possible options. This movie is just the beginning of her story.";

	schema:reviewBody "Two high school outcasts Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson graduate and it appears that the duo will continue to be best friends. They seek out work and a place to live but before that they go around and make fun of seemingly everyone around them. The situations are quirky and hilarious but soon they pull a prank on a lonely man Steve Buscemi that leaves Birch feeling sorry for the stranger. Thus Birch with Johansson in tow decide to meet Buscemi and the results are mixed at best. However the strangest of relationships starts as Birch makes it a goal to find a woman that Buscemi can date. Meanwhile Johansson accepts what she must do and starts to work at a local Starbucks. Birch totally unsure of what she wants to do with her life both personally and professionally begins to drift away from her best friend just as Buscemi finds a woman he likes Stacy Travis. Oddly Birch becomes jealous of this development and does her best to keep Buscemi single and miserable like herself obviously. Birch struggles through with all this plus a homelife that she dislikes as her father the priceless Bob Balaban starts to recreate a relationship with a woman that she has always hated the uncredited Teri Garr in a short cameo. She also spends her days taking a remedial art class so she can indeed finalize her high school diploma. Ghost World is an immensely interesting experience as Birch best known for American Beauty and Johansson who is an amazing young talent just think Lost in Translation are totally believable as youngsters with quiet angst and sadness issues. Their slow divergence as the film progresses is a hard thing to view because you know that neither want that. Buscemi is amazing as a loner who mirrors the two youngsters Birch in particular. Cowriters Terry Zwigoff who also directed and Daniel Clowes received Oscar nominations for a script that was actually adapted from a comic book no kidding. This is a wonderfully smart and poignant black comedy that is arguably the best production from the teen genre. It is to the 2000s what Rebel Without a Cause was to the 1950s and what American Graffiti was to the 1970s. There are also shades of Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces here. An underrated and exceptional gem. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ghost World 2001 by cult director Terry Zwigoff Bad Santa 2003 is aimed at the intelligent open minded and cultured teenagers who are aware of what is ahead of them yet choose to enjoy the life of a child and not wanting to grow up. Keeping in mind it is a film it could be enjoyed by anyone.Amazing to see a teenagedbased film that doesn't revolve around titties toilet humor beer and drugs but more so revolves around culture and intelligence and pushes the fact that not all teenagers are useless. In fact there are many teenagers out there who are rather intelligent mature and wise beyond their years yet still like their basic humour associated with other peoples demise which in this film is done amazingly well and it is quite relatable when we see Enid and Rebecca laughing at the satanists in the diner. My friends and I usually laugh at that typical fat dirty old man in the city who hits on young girls or those freakylooking folks who have no sense of fashion which as mean as it is is just a little fun which is exactly what these girls do and this relates to modern teenagers.What Ghost World also holds is mountains and mountains of culture all dating way back to the 1960's Bollywood films and the 1970's underground music which is so satisfying to see now as so many people my age don't comprehend or care for they prefer trash that MTV spits in our faces and know we'll love it and buy but the thing is because the majority is rather culturally inept and likes anything dating from 2001 to modern times leaves the other types left out where do they go? They must dig and dig under all this modern pop culture to find the real hip stuff the real cool stuff that our mothers and fathers listened to and watched when they were kids and Ghost World is satisfying because its so up to date with the minority and yet references so many musicians artists and films and its striking out to those MTV kids and others the MTV kids who don't know who Pink Floyd is or the ones who've never heard of the film Midnight Express or 8 which is even mentioned in this film. It's a relief and leaves a smile on such nonconformist types the ones who aren't emo or gangsta or this or that. It could be for everyone of course but this film is clearly aimed at particular audiences.Now on with the actual film itself. I would say apart from the great style and culture of the movie its still great acting characters story ending everything. The whole movie is brilliance in a bottle. Enid and Rebecca best friends alternative hip kids have just graduated school rolling their eyes over their fellow pop loving peers but Enid doesn't want to grow up she doesn't want to change herself for a bunch of customers at a job she doesn't want to move out of home. She wants to be in a kid forever which so many kids our age can relate to. Many of us don't want to grow up. Where Rebecca is mature and all she's waiting for Enid to move into an apartment with her and get a job but Enid is far too busy with her nerdy record collecting friend Seymour who she previously stood up for as a joke. As time goes on Enid spends more and more of her spare time with Seymour and ends up losing her school certificate because she didn't turn up to the art show and everything for her falls apart. Ever wanted to just disappear and no one would ever ask what happened to you Enid said to Rebecca. No. She replies.As we saw previously in the film an old senile man waits at the bus stop for a bus that doesn't come by anymore. Enid says to him at some stage ever since my life fell apart you're the only one I can rely on because I know you'll always be here or something along those lines where as this somewhat explains that Enid's entire world is changing except this one lonesome man at the bus stop but once he says he is leaving this means her entire life is changing. He catches the bus symbolizing everything has changed for Enid. Even in the end Enid has caught that same bus which represents after all the things Enid has put herself through she is finally accepting to grow up and start her life. A great relatable and cultured film with for me ranks grade A marks in my book. This film is beyond recommendation this film should be seen by everyone whether you like it or not you can't just be ignorant you have to look into this film and analysis it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw this movie I fing went insane!  Best movie I had ever seen! I saw it on the first day of school that year so it started me off pumped.  It meant so much to me and accentuated and made sense of many parts of my life. I cannot explain how close I am to this movie. My best fiend saw it with me too and we have been a lot closer since then.It was very smartly written realistic as hell not necessarily the actions but the feelings behind the actions taken in this movie.It is basically about this girl named Enid Thora Birch who has just graduated high school and doesn't know where her life is going. She quickly discriminates against others though I think that most of the time she is justified.  Enid and her friend Rebecca are spending the whole movie thinking about getting an apartment but Enid procrastinates. She basically stops caring about anything that will help her in life and entertains herself by hating everything that she can.  This makes her depressed and she loves it.  Enid becomes involved with an older jazzragtime enthusiast named Seymour Steve Buscemi who has issues relating to others. Enid likes is intrigued by him and feels that he can relate to her better than anyone else that she knows in her world. Seymour is her drug. As a drama Ghost World was great. The first half of the movie though was one of the funniest darkest setups I have ever seen. A lot of sarcastic humor that many would call ist but whatever. It's got some of the best one liners I've ever heard. I will not go on and on about the ending because other reviewers have overly voiced their 10 line opinions about how it's so good that it's gone past bad and back to good again or really sucky and artsy. About the ending I will say this It is not a normal Hollywood ending. That's good. Hollywood is redundant.A tampon in a teacup?It's my response to a women's right to choose. It's something I feel super strongly about!".

My best fiend saw it with me too and we have been a lot closer since then.It was very smartly written realistic as hell not necessarily the actions but the feelings behind the actions taken in this movie.It is basically about this girl named Enid Thora Birch who has just graduated high school and doesn't know where her life is going. She quickly discriminates against others though I think that most of the time she is justified.  Enid and her friend Rebecca are spending the whole movie thinking about getting an apartment but Enid procrastinates. She basically stops caring about anything that will help her in life and entertains herself by hating everything that she can.  This makes her depressed and she loves it.  Enid becomes involved with an older jazzragtime enthusiast named Seymour Steve Buscemi who has issues relating to others. Enid likes is intrigued by him and feels that he can relate to her better than anyone else that she knows in her world. Seymour is her drug. As a drama Ghost World was great. The first half of the movie though was one of the funniest darkest setups I have ever seen. A lot of sarcastic humor that many would call ist but whatever. It's got some of the best one liners I've ever heard. I will not go on and on about the ending because other reviewers have overly voiced their 10 line opinions about how it's so good that it's gone past bad and back to good again or really sucky and artsy. About the ending I will say this It is not a normal Hollywood ending. That's good. Hollywood is redundant.A tampon in a teacup?It's my response to a women's right to choose. It's something I feel super strongly about!";

	schema:headline " Memorable film my favourite of Terry Zwigoff";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of Enid Tora Birch and Rebecca Scarlett Johansson after they finish the high school. Both have problems to be related with people and they spend their time hanging around and bothering creeps. When they met Seymour Steve Buscemi who is a social outsider who loves to collect old vinyl records the life of Enid will change forever.The screenplay of this memorable film was based on a comic book with the same name created by Daniel Clowes. The plot is very simple but excellent and there are a lot of memorable dialogs and two memorable characters that makes this film as one of the most original films ever and that is without a doubt Terry Zwigoff's masterpiece. The way that the film start when we can see how Enid and Rebecca spend their time is really strange in consequence of the strange attitude of the characters . I mean when they follow the satanic couple is really bizarre but later they just forget about them in less than a minute and they stop in a restaurant and it's even more bizarre. And there are lots of this kind of scenes that makes this characters truly memorable and the best thing is that they are believable. And the other main character Seymour is also great. The lines of all the characters are really great and the critic to the ignorant society too specially the scene when a man is looking for the film 8 12 by Fellini and the video clerk give him the film Nine 12 Weeks with Mickey Rourke.Well the cast is perfect Tora Birch is amazing in the best character of the film Scarlett Johansson is perfect in all the ways and Steve Buscemi is excellent like always in a memorable character. The rest of the cast is excellent too like the rest of the secondary characters like Josh Brad Renfro or Roberta Allsworth Illeana Douglas. And the music is another perfect thing of this film just like in every other masterpiece like this one.Conclusion i really love this film that is highly rewatchable and for me is one the best films of the 00's and amazingly original. I haven't read the comic book but Daniel Clowes the creator write the film too so i think is very similar to the comic book that i'm going to get soon. So watch this film is funny thanks to the great satire to the society but also is sad thanks to one character who doesn't know what to do with her life and is quite disappointed with the rest of the world. A ghost world. 10 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Another gem in the wasteland of tired old teen movies";
	schema:reviewBody "The end of high school can be a polarizing experience. On the one hand its the start of a whole new and exciting life. But on the other its a terrifying prospect. Its the first time in a young person's life when they can get out into the real world and see what lies in wait for them. Either exciting surprises or grave disappointments.Ghost World my choice for best teen film of 2001 neatly captures the mindset of anguished teenagers at this particular crossroads in life. Its not always accessible but in this day and age of cookie cutter teen fodder that's something of a relief.The two teens Ghost World chooses to observe are Enid and Rebecca both wonderfully played by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson. The opening scene witnesses their high school graduation. Something Enid  Rebecca greet with almost casual indifference. Their lives are undeniably changing they just haven't decided if its for better or worse.Ghost World is a film that seems to occupy a bizarre buffer zone between two netherworlds. Its a skewed vision of suburbia not unlike something out of a Tim Burton or a John Waters film. And director Terry Zwigoff paints a quite appealing portrait of an oddball utopia slowly being swallowed up by progress such as minimarts and consumerism.Enid  Rebecca are casual observers. Anything that falls below their radar you can bet Enid will have some witty rejoinder or dry comment dripping in sarcasm on hand while Rebecca stands off to the side mulling it over and chipping in if and when necessary.The film charts the deterioration of their friendship. Although Enid is in no hurry to grow up and get on with things Rebecca senses an inevitability to her life. Being a nonconformist is one thing but at some point we all have to conform to some of life's expectations of us.Rebecca gets a job at Starbucks or something like it and goes apartment hunting for herself and Enid. Things like these don't interest Enid. She's trapped in a perpetual fantasy. A bubble she believes will remain intact. And when she does try to follow Rebecca's example doing a regular job its like watching a dog walk on its hind legs.Enid wasn't meant for normal life. She loves to stand out from everyone around her. And she has an eclectic wardrobe for each and every social occasion. Rebecca may be an outsider too but perhaps she recognises it as one of life's many phases.So with Enid  Rebecca growing further and further apart Enid finds solace in Seymour a perfectly cast Steve Buscemi a record collector unlucky in love. Enid plays a rather cruel joke on Seymour by responding to a personal ad he put in the paper. She stands him up sort of by observing him from a distance like she does with everything and becomes fascinated by this oddity of a man.She senses a kindred spirit in Seymour. Someone who doesn't fit in a social misfit and inept at life's ironies. But when she actually gets Seymour a date he starts spending less and less time with Enid. And as Enid's perfectly perceptive world falls apart she spirals into depression and despair.Ghost World is the type of teen film you pray for and when it finally comes you almost feel like slapping yourself in astonishment. A teen film that's witty sharp but most of all perceptive. Also one of its nicest touches is the fact it stars actual teenagers for a change not adults ten years older.Ghost World comes with a positively antiauthoritarian stamp on it. I sense Terry Zwigoff is a bit of a nonconformist himself. And he's selected two superb actresses to carry the film off with aplomb.Thora Birch is the undisputed star. She so neatly captures Enid's character you couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Her performance is so wonderful the way it rotates from cynicism intuition and eventually gutwrenching despair. Each line of dialogue she delivers to perfection. From capital letter to full stop. And yet despite being attuned to the world around her she is naive in her way. She has the vain belief things will always stay the same. Observing the world at a coldly detached distance. But as the world makes her a participant its something that shatters her world forever. What an impressive heartbreaking performance from someone so young.Ghost World came at a time just before Scarlett Johansson's career took off. And although she doesn't get as much screen time as Birch she's equally impressive. She quite modestly allows Birch to take the spotlight because she knows its Enid's life story that's captured our interest. Johansson's performance is more subtle than Birch's but she is necessary because she provides an effective counterpoint to Enid's role without having to do very much at all. Which is why Scarlett Johansson is such a wonderful actress. But she'd have to wait for Lost in Translation to show her true mettle where she plays a character not all that different from Rebecca.Steve Buscemi is in his element as Seymour. He's the man we hope to never become. Buscemi is known for choosing quirky offcentre roles and Seymour is no exception. A man of few joys and even fewer accomplishments.The crux of Ghost World is Enid. What she slowly senses is that her defiantly defended role as life's abject observer can't go on forever. One day she will have to grow up. And perhaps she does at the end. The last thing we ever see of her is getting on a bus. Where she's going is a mystery. But at least she's getting out of town. Perhaps progress has finally caught up with Enid.Cherish Ghost World. Its the perfect antidote to predictable teen movies and their comfortable clichs.".

	schema:headline " The meaning of Ghost World";
	schema:reviewBody "I liked this movie very much not so much while watching we were expecting more of a comedy but upon reflecting that night. To me Ghost World the title refers to a world that's no longer alive to the main characters especially Enid though also to a lesser degree Rebecca and Seymour. Enid's life is no in longer in the world in which she has grown up certainly not with her father and not being carried along with the mainstream thoughtlessness and a lockstep life e.g. just going to college cause everyone else does. But neither is the plan she long shared with Rebecca  working in a whatevertype job and living independently  working out. The idea of moving in with Seymour and becoming his girlfriend was borne of a sentiment of desperation that she almost immediately recognized as such.The movie is about growing up and moving on from ghosts and into life and how hard but necessary that is. I wasn't thrilled with the NormanBus story line but I understand it as a metaphor. It seems as though there is no busline out of town but in fact there is. Enid doesn't know what she's talking about when she repeats what everyone knows and what is written on the bench about this line not being in service. The one person she imagines will always be there crazy Norman waiting for the bus in fact leaves on that bus. She sees both that no one is always there as you might want them to be and also that it is possible to leave. Having attempted but not surrendered to the unsatisfactory options in her world she won't toe the company line at her movietheater job won't accept life with a totally outoftouch father and fiance and won't become Seymour's girlfriendwife she realizes after a great deal of probably necessary pain that if she is to join the world of the living she too must leave what has become her Ghost World.".

The main character in the movie Thora Birch plays a recent high school graduate who has this I'm so much better than everybody else attitude. Everything she sees around her she considers sucky in some way. However she ends up befriending a lonely record collector and this is when the story began to get interesting. I won't go into spoiler details but she pretty much ruins Seymour's chance at happiness because she becomes jealous when Seymour begins to see and like a woman Enid pleaded with him to meet originally. She is a twisted little girl. I was thinking about the title too. I believe the title is not about her living in a ghost world per se it is the opposite. She is actually the one living as a ghost in the world. She goes thru life like a ghost. Her attitude ostracizes her from her best girlfriend and her friend Seymour whom she ends up misleading into a life of misery when he was so close to finding true happiness. She went thru life not as a person with hopes and dreams but as a ghost dead inside and raining on everyone's parade. And what does she do at the end? She rides off into the sunset as a ghost would...unseen without a sound and with nobody to really care. She actually tells Seymour this is her fantasy earlier in the picture.

This film actually stands out on its own and the performances are excellent. Steve Buscemi is believable and sympathetic as the local loser who Enid and her friend decide to stalk.

Classic.Enid also reflects that she will miss the geeky classmate who she will never see again a familiar sense that what is to come may also be a disappointment. The underlying theme of Seymour's Buscemi's collection of 78's and a lost world is touching and effective. He works as a VP at what was formerly known as Coon Chicken.

Yes there were places like that Seymour says now it is less out in the open. The possibility that we all live in a ghost world of our own is not just a remote possibility.This film is excellent for its creative portrayal of disenfranchisement discontent and the humor that saves us from despair.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS LIE WITHINFirst of all I did not enjoy Enid's social critique. I fall into the loser category myself but find it unnecessary to create such perfectly stereotyped onedimensional characters around Enid for her to be cynical about. Enid and Seymour were in fact the only three dimensional characters in this movie as Enid's girl companion failed to deliver a wellrounded performance. I enjoyed American Beauty for the story about Kevin Spacey realizing the hopelessness of his marriage and adopting a better lifestyle. However the preachy social commentary by Birch and the boy with the camera failed to strike home. And it is this same commentary in Ghost World except much more cruel that fails to create empathy for Enid. So by this point I am watching the movie with two characters with any depth whatsoever and one of them cruel and preachy. The other character played by Steve Buscemi was being antagonized throughout the movie and I felt nothing but sympathy for him as Enid used and discarded him. The pacing was lopsided and boring. Nothing will happen for long stretches of time and then everything will quickly happen leading on to another long stretch of irrelevant scenes. I would be willing to overlook this if there were actually some humor in this comedy but the writers try to provoke laughter with cruel social commentary that I do not fall for. The ending of this movie is reminiscent of the frog scene in Magnolia. The director just ran out of steam in a plot that was already going downhill and decided to tack on an ending that makes no logical sense whatsoever. At least the frograining phenomenon really happened in Mexico City this bustonowhere business is just absurd. What is the point of this movie? The point of this movie is that everyone except gothic independent spirits does not understand the world and that we are supposed to have empathy for a heartless girl merely because she is a member of a social minority. If you want to see good independent film go buy an old Coen Brothers flick or better yet Memento.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is a picture that for every conceivable reason shouldn't work  but on a purely emotional level it does. Most viewers could be easily misled and disappointed by expecting a light romantic comedy or a wild sex farce. Instead Blake Edwards and his coscreenwriters offer something entirely different a picture far more complex meaningful and thoughtprovoking than what we might anticipate.The Man Who Loved Women tells a sad sad story about a middleaged man Burt Reynolds in one of his finest performances as David Fowler who drowns in isolation thanks to a rare ability he's forced and driven by instinct to glimpse the sacredness and inner beauty of almost every woman he encounters. Yes on some levels his circumstances lead to a hedonistic paradise. But his feelings also prevent him from ever making a commitment and isolate him from the joy of knowing one woman exclusively.For that reason a melancholic canopy hangs over the entire film and takes the front seat to humour. The story begins with David Fowler's death and every event we witness onscreen is tinged by our knowledge that Fowler's obsession with women will eventually kill him. A slow heavy stringed theme song Mancini's Little Boys plays softly throughout the film and Fowler's words in voiceover narration constantly remind us of the deep incurable loneliness that plagues him.All of this might sound heavyhanded  and it very well could be if it weren't for the sexual fantasy and wild Edwards comedy that flesh out the story and provide relief. The melancholia and comedy work together and Edwards achieves a delicate balance of mood a bittersweet aura.I've heard one criticism see Ebert's review that many of the story's psychological elements are impossible. Though a few scenes might suffer from exaggeration hundreds and HUNDREDS of women attend David's funeral one could easily dismiss the story  as I did at first because so many male viewers lack Fowler's ability to care for women unconditionally we want to believe that it's impossible for a contemporary Don Juan to exist. But that simply isn't tenable. My own theory about the film  and it's just a theory  is that Edwards may have pulled inspiration for Fowler from the late John Derek another man worshipped and adored by women who interacted with Edwards during the filming of 10 1979.Edwards and his cowriters lend a gentle touch to the film by crafting Fowler's character againstthegrain while we might expect a narcissistic hedonist he's just the opposite  a warm gentle soul with only the sincerest motives. It's easy to understand why women are attracted to Fowler from his first appearance onscreen. And oddly  male viewers may never begrudge Fowler his affairs only applaud  because his narration and his gentle spirit confirm the fact that he really does worship and adore everything about the girls who walk in and out of his life. I keep thinking he says sadly about all the women I'm never gonna know...In one of the film's most revealing and effective moments Edwards allows us to glimpse a woman at the funeral who is the complete opposite of a 10  fat homely depressed  undesirable. We have the distinct impression that her external appearance didn't matter to Fowler  that he only looked into her heart and perceived her beauty. It lends credibility to psychologist Marianna's Julie Andrews observation that David did indeed love all of the girls equally and unconditionally.".

Of course the Pink Panther series is a masterpiece in and of itself.But this film is weak and uninspired laden with narrativeI've never really figured who came up with the idea of opening a 'comedy' with the main character's funeral and an accompanying heartwrenching eulogy from one of his lovers.Don't accept a copy when the original is available.";

Actually the movie begins with his funeral and we see woman after woman in all shapes and sizes roaming up the cemetery grass to pay tribute to this guy.Now any movie with an opening like this had better feature one helluva guy so we immediately cut to the scenes of Burt seducing woman after woman while providing some tender advice on life to keep them warm when he's gone in the morning.  I really liked Burt Reynolds performance in this movie. He shows in this movie that when he wants to he can be a fine actor.  We know Burt Reynolds has an amazing screen presence but it's nice to see him in a movie where he doesn't wink at the camera to show us how much fun he's having.  His scenes with the feminist shrinkJulie Andrews are funny as Reynolds exhibits every male symptom in the book.  The women are Cynthia Sikes Marila Henner and Kim Basinger to name a few and rest assured that they're allespecially Basingervery beautiful.If the movie had stayed true to this idea it might've been special.but it degenerates into a series of three's company set ups and grows tired. After Basinger stirs Reynolds interest they have a romp in her husband's condo.  The husband arrives and Reynolds must lurch around.  I couldn't count how many scenes there were like that.  It's at this point we realize the movie isn't going to be as incisive as it promised.  It's silly how Reynolds keeps getting into the same situation with the jealous husband and not very funny either not even when he say glues his hands to the steering wheel.Another major problem is the chemistry between Reynolds and Andrews. There's no heat between them and I suspect that maybe they didn't get along with each other on the set.  This isn't the type of a man she'd go out with canon of ethics aside. It's awkward at the end when Andrews drops everything to join Reynolds on vacation when we don't even believe he's gotten to first base.  I can't quite recommend THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN it's just not true to itself.   The movie introduces us to an interesting man looking to make real discoveries and ends up with a bunch of people who aren't right for each other.DGSTAR STAR  out of four".

As such he ends up isolated and on the couch of a therapist Marianna Julie Andrews. The entire movie consists of Marianna trying to figure David out and help him while the latter relays several of his amorous connections in flashback. When the therapy is over will THEY start a relationship? Fowler's many women include Kim Basinger Marilu Henner and Denise Crosby.I encourage you to read Nsouthern51's review from April 25 2001 on IMDb because it expertly interprets and evaluates the movie. While the film could be considered a romantic comedy it's also a tragic study of a Romeo and therefore there's a pall of melancholy despite the light tone and amusing elements including black comedy. Speaking of which while I don't think adultery's something to take lightly and therefore don't find it very amusing it ties into Fowler's folly and blindness due to his weakness women.The good thing is that Fowler's not all bad or unlikable Burt is his typical amiable self in an atypical role. He's not the conventional lothario who uses and abuses he genuinely loves women and is fascinated by them. He loves them so much he can't bear to be with just one because that would mean he'd never know hundreds or thousands of others but then he aches because he doesn't want to hurt the women he leaves.The best part is Fowler's salvation of a newtothetrade prostitute whom he ends up hiring for his sculpting business. He nobly resists acting on his carnal instincts and therefore sacrifices for her good. The girl is played by a preStar Trek TNG Denise Crosby and she looks great.At the end of the day the movie features Reynolds in an unusual role which might turn off fans and the strange mix of melancholy and amusement may turnoff others. It's not great but it's good enough for what it is and therefore worthwhile. It's similar to Altman's Dr. T and the Women 2000 so if you don't like that movie you probably won't like this one.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Houston Texas and Los Angeles CA.GRADE B".

	schema:reviewBody "Opera Ghost Page2Another point that nsouthern51 made was that David Fowler 'drowns in isolation.' This in fact a bit of a complex statement and somewhat contradictory from the films point of view. This statement seems to suggest or hint at that David is either cutoff from the world or is completely unknown to the world or both. Perhaps both statements are true. Perhaps both statements are false. Or perhaps one is true and the other false or vise versa.Let's return to the film for a minute. David Fowler has known hundreds and HUNDREDS of women and is always looking for more. How can he be so lonely? If he was inbetween women he had the semilivein girlfriend Courtney Wade. So he always or almost always had someone around him at home. If he was lonely by knowing hundreds and HUNDREDS of women he surely had telephone numbers to call and surely one would respond. Or reverse it they could be calling him. With all thoughs women around he would have to fight them off with a fly swatter or girl swatter. In the work place we see that he had several assistants. So how can he be so lonely and cutoff? David Fowler wasn't a hermit like Howard Hughes nor an oddity like Glen Gould. From the film we see that his work was wellknown. He lived in L.A. but has a commission in Houston Tx. So we see that he wasn't just a local artist but someone who is wellrespected on a national level.This might be debatable. From Sue the baby sitter we learn that he is known in academia circles 'Lipschitz Henry Moore and me.' We also see from the film that he wrote a book. I'm sure the book was meant for a national audience and not just one or two copies made for a private edition nor several hundred printed for a local audience. This again proves or demonstrates that he was wellknown or was wanting more name recognition and wasn't trying to cut himself off from the world.In summary do these contradictory statements mean anything? There might be something more going on at a much much deeper level.When we get into the actual review we will have to return to these statements. There is a lot to these statements. Like I said folks this is one of most complex motion pictures ever filmed. This complexity that I speak of is not the complexity of cameras film lights etc. of a Lord of The Rings type epic but of an quiet inner complexity ideas the likes of which this film The Man Who Loved Women has no equal. There are things going on in this movie that have never been done before and will never be done again. Ever.O.G.".

This statement seems to suggest or hint at that David is either cutoff from the world or is completely unknown to the world or both. Perhaps both statements are true. Perhaps both statements are false. Or perhaps one is true and the other false or vise versa.Let's return to the film for a minute. David Fowler has known hundreds and HUNDREDS of women and is always looking for more. How can he be so lonely? If he was inbetween women he had the semilivein girlfriend Courtney Wade. So he always or almost always had someone around him at home. If he was lonely by knowing hundreds and HUNDREDS of women he surely had telephone numbers to call and surely one would respond. Or reverse it they could be calling him. With all thoughs women around he would have to fight them off with a fly swatter or girl swatter. In the work place we see that he had several assistants. So how can he be so lonely and cutoff? David Fowler wasn't a hermit like Howard Hughes nor an oddity like Glen Gould. From the film we see that his work was wellknown. He lived in L.A. but has a commission in Houston Tx. So we see that he wasn't just a local artist but someone who is wellrespected on a national level.This might be debatable. From Sue the baby sitter we learn that he is known in academia circles 'Lipschitz Henry Moore and me.' We also see from the film that he wrote a book. I'm sure the book was meant for a national audience and not just one or two copies made for a private edition nor several hundred printed for a local audience. This again proves or demonstrates that he was wellknown or was wanting more name recognition and wasn't trying to cut himself off from the world.In summary do these contradictory statements mean anything? There might be something more going on at a much much deeper level.When we get into the actual review we will have to return to these statements. There is a lot to these statements. Like I said folks this is one of most complex motion pictures ever filmed. This complexity that I speak of is not the complexity of cameras film lights etc. of a Lord of The Rings type epic but of an quiet inner complexity ideas the likes of which this film The Man Who Loved Women has no equal. There are things going on in this movie that have never been done before and will never be done again. Ever.O.G.";

	schema:reviewBody "This review is being extensively rewritten.While rewriting this review I learned with great sadness that Blake Edwards had passed away. My deepest sympathy and condolences go out to Julie Edwards and to her entire family. The world will certainly miss a truly great director. I would have dearly dearly loved to have met him while he was alive.The Man Who Loved Women should be considered one of the world's greatest masterpieces. The film is one of the most brilliant most deceptive and one of the world's deepest films ever filmed in Hollywood or anyplace else in the world. The film should have won multiple Oscars for all concerned including Best Picture. And if it were at all possible Blake Edwards should have been awarded a Nobel Prize for the screenplay for its extreme complexity extreme subtlety and richness of symbolism. The screenplay is worthy of world class literature status and should be in every class room anthology that students have to read. If they can study Harry Potter in school they sure should be able to read Blake Edwards extreme masterpiece. It is my intention to prove to you and to the rest of the world that that this film deserves all that I claim and more! And at the end I would very much like future reviews to indicate how many stars Oscars and Nobels that they would award. And yes you can totally disagree with everything that I will explain.I was reading one of the boards and noted one post that asked What is this movie about? I can honestly say without ego that I'm probably the only person in the world who can understand about 99 of the movie. That is why this movie has had such great fascination for me over the years and why I believe so strongly that Blake Edwards should have been awarded a Nobel for the screenplay. This movie which on the surface app ears so utterly simple is in fact quite complex.But first you must understand the purpose of the film. Along time ago there was an unauthorized biography of Julie Edwards running around. In the book Blake Edwards says something to the effect thatand this not a direct quote that his wife is one of the deepest and most pro found women in the world. This fact is something that I've known for years long before the book came out. Anyway that leaves a problem. A big problem. And that is how to show it or pay tribute to her. I think Blake Edwards found away. In fact I know he found a way.And now to the review there are two major motion pictures and one minor motion picture interwoven into each other to form one great masterpiece. The minor motion picture is The Man Who Loved Women. The other is Irving Stone's The Agony and The Ecstasy which based on the life of Michaelangelo. The other I will discuss later. In other words he used a minor motion picture to hide two major motion pictures behind it. And to prove my point I have to discuss plots to two movies. If you have not seen either DO NOT PROCEED. We are going to use DF for David Fowler and MA for Michaelangelo. So let's look at these forced coincidence. These are not my words but come from another source. 1 DF Sculpturewriter. 2 MA Sculpturewriter. 3 DF Sports a beard. 4 MA Sports a beard. 5 DF Trouble with women. 6 MA Trouble with a women. 7 DF Trouble with a block of stone. 8 MA Trouble with a ceiling. 9. DF Goes to Marianna to get help. 10. MA goes to Contesstina to get answers 11. DF tells Nancy thats my work. A piece of sculpture in the center of the floor. 12. MA Charleton Heston in voice over goes over the life work of Michangelo at beginning of movie. 13. DF Roy tells David Fowler I don't completely understand it. Refering to David's sculptor. Something like my wife. 14. MA Michaelangelo complains to Pope Julius II why you send these fools to judge my work? 15. DF Nanc y says over the phone' Understand your time problem. 16.

	schema:headline " Sweet funny and endearing";
	schema:reviewBody "For those that don't already know the second half to that Zack and Miri title is Make a Porno three little words that have caused a lot of fuss lately. In addition to being deliberately shortened on TV Kevin Smith Clerks Chasing Amy has had to fight for even the Rrating a teaser trailer had to be removed from his website the posters for the flick were so raunchy that the characters could only appear as stick figuresof which Seth Rogen is assuredly not and already certain theaters have decided not to show it while openly showing Saw V and Max Payne without a moments hesitation. All this for one of the years nicest romantic comedies. Zack and Miri is vintage Kevin Smith blending the cheerily offensive with heartfelt sentimentality and while its nothing groundbreaking or even terribly gratuitous sure there are some cock and ball ass and boob shots but what comedy doesn't have those nowadays it's also one of Smith's most successful attempts with the formula.Seth Rogen plays Zack and Elizabeth Banks plays Miri two best friends living in a crummy little apartment in Pittsburgh. The bills are stacking up  the heat and electricity have been turned off and they're about to be thrown out on their ass. What do two struggling thirtysomethings do? While crashing their High School reunion they discover that the school's former Quarterback Superman Return's Brandon Routh is actually gay and the boyfriend of gay porn star Brandon Justin Long. This gives Zack an idea and after ruminating over it for a night he and Miri both decide that a cheap porno is the only way to solve their money woes. They enlist the help of Zack's coffee shop coworker Delaney Craig Robinson to be producer and also bring on a rag tag team of actors Jason Mewes Jeff Anderson Traci Lords Katie Morgan and Ricky Mabe first to shoot the movie Star Whores with such characters as R2Teabag Hung Solo and Darth Vibrator and then when that encounters a shooting problem they decide to do a coffee shop porn called Swallow my CockUcinno.The problem Smith often encounters is that sometimes it feels like he's throwing Fwords vibrator pussy and jerkoff jokes at us a little too easily and it doesn't really jive well with the sweeter side that comes later. As an example watch Jersey Girl. Just here he has a good balance for the most part. It starts off a little shaky but settles in nicely with crude jokes that earn big laughs.

The rest of the cast is a big help starting with The Offices Craig Robinson who nails every line the character has whether it's defying what he believes to be racism talking about his wife or nervously auditioning porn stars he's the funniest character in the movie hands down. A close second is Justin Long hilariously flamboyant and filled with gay pride to the point of being applauseworthy this character deserves his own movie. And Jason Mewes is at his crude best in every scene he's in. Zack and Miri gets very good performances from everybody and it manages to do what a lot of romantic comedies this year have not been able to do which is earn the laughs and earn the love of it's two characters. It's funny fun and you don't even need a condom to enjoy it. Let's see Max Payne try to make a similar claim.".

	onyx:emotionText "For those that don't already know the second half to that Zack and Miri title is Make a Porno three little words that have caused a lot of fuss lately. In addition to being deliberately shortened on TV Kevin Smith Clerks Chasing Amy has had to fight for even the Rrating a teaser trailer had to be removed from his website the posters for the flick were so raunchy that the characters could only appear as stick figuresof which Seth Rogen is assuredly not and already certain theaters have decided not to show it while openly showing Saw V and Max Payne without a moments hesitation. All this for one of the years nicest romantic comedies. Zack and Miri is vintage Kevin Smith blending the cheerily offensive with heartfelt sentimentality and while its nothing groundbreaking or even terribly gratuitous sure there are some cock and ball ass and boob shots but what comedy doesn't have those nowadays it's also one of Smith's most successful attempts with the formula.Seth Rogen plays Zack and Elizabeth Banks plays Miri two best friends living in a crummy little apartment in Pittsburgh. The bills are stacking up  the heat and electricity have been turned off and they're about to be thrown out on their ass. What do two struggling thirtysomethings do? While crashing their High School reunion they discover that the school's former Quarterback Superman Return's Brandon Routh is actually gay and the boyfriend of gay porn star Brandon Justin Long. This gives Zack an idea and after ruminating over it for a night he and Miri both decide that a cheap porno is the only way to solve their money woes. They enlist the help of Zack's coffee shop coworker Delaney Craig Robinson to be producer and also bring on a rag tag team of actors Jason Mewes Jeff Anderson Traci Lords Katie Morgan and Ricky Mabe first to shoot the movie Star Whores with such characters as R2Teabag Hung Solo and Darth Vibrator and then when that encounters a shooting problem they decide to do a coffee shop porn called Swallow my CockUcinno.The problem Smith often encounters is that sometimes it feels like he's throwing Fwords vibrator pussy and jerkoff jokes at us a little too easily and it doesn't really jive well with the sweeter side that comes later. As an example watch Jersey Girl. Just here he has a good balance for the most part. It starts off a little shaky but settles in nicely with crude jokes that earn big laughs. A diarrhea gag is priceless a character named Bubbles has a unique talent and the names themselves are great fun take the David Mamet inspired Glen and Garry Suck Ross' Cock for example.

This follows the explicit whatyouseeiswhatyouget nature of every pornographic film title a fact that offers hilarious moments as Zack and Miri are eventually faced with the difficult task of creating a movie title that says it all.Yes Zack and Miri Make a Porno is exactly that Zack and Miri making a porno. And believe you me there is plenty of potty mouth to go around. But as dirty as the movie is you will be surprised and delighted to find that this is a movie with a lot of heart and as with all Kevin Smith pieces a great deal of brain no pun intended.Zack and Miri have been BFF's since the first grade which has rendered their relationship strictly platonic. They have never really amounted to much since graduating high school ten years ago but know that deep down inside they are really much better than the others or at least tell themselves that.At the high school reunion Zack and Miri have to endure the inevitable the mindless chitchat and feigned nostalgia. The only reason Zack goes is to laugh at people while Miri goes to show her high school crush what a hottie she's become. To Zack the night is a success thanks to a hilarious cameo by Justin Long while Miri's night doesn't quite go as planned. What they come away with is the realization that they really need to do something with their lives if only to save them from their economic crisis a story that is not uncommon in America these days. You guessed it. They make a porno.As silly as it sounds there is something truly heartfelt albeit raunchy about watching Zack and Miri and the rest of their crew make their porn movie. It's kind of like watching Mark Borchardt make his low budget horror flick in the hilarious documentary American Movie only the porn Zack and Miri and company make is quite possibly the worst porn ever made okay okay that may be an exaggeration but you get my point.All around is a job well done by the cast and cameos. Seth Rogan plays the everyman to a T and Elizabeth Banks shines as the high school outcast turned hottie. Their chemistry as platonic friends is golden and sparks truly fly when their true feelings finally come to light. You'll see familiar faces from both the View Askewniverse and the Apatow family creating pure hilarity as both of these comic forces collide.Zack and Miri Make a Porno is less about making a porno than it is about everyday people finding their niche in life. Their niche in life just so happens to be making pornos. Zack and Miri Make a Porno can be synonymous to Joe SixPack Becomes a Professional Wrestler or Joe the Plumber Makes Over 250000 a Year. Venues who opted not to show this film I feel are overreacting a bit. Although Kevin Smith's latest certainly lives up to the name what we ultimately get is a feelgood movie. And a feelgood movie has never felt so good. In the end Zack and Miri made a porno and Kevin Smith made an awesome movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love deceptive marketing campaigns. Usually they make movies hitormisses financially but deceptive marketing shows a lot of faith in a film which is what every viewer should have in this one. Have faith in the fact that this film despite being controversial and borderline wrong in some parts is one of the funniest and sweetest romantic comedies of the decade. What happens when you mix Kevin Smith's witty and snappy dialog with the outrageous humor of a guy like Seth Rogen? Pure brilliance that's what.ZM is a movie of depth and emotion. Yes I'm talking about the movie with the extremely blunt title. What I like about both of our 'names' Smith and Rogen is that no matter how raunchy they get no matter how much they cross the line they have a habit of making their films have real heart. It's the same here and it looks like everyone involved had fun making the film...in every sense of the word...What makes the movie work so well is the amazing platonic and romantic chemistry of the two leads Rogen and Elizabeth Banks who is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I can't think of two performers who have skyrocketed more in terms of fame over the last three years and to see them together again after The 40 Year Old Virgin was a good treat. They work so well together that I found myself smiling at them in pretty much every scene they share or 80 of the movie and it makes the experience so much better. They really make you feel comfortable and warm inside I can hear the sex jokes coming already.It's not just our wonderful leads that make the movie great it's performers like Jason Mewes playing a variant of his usual 'Jay' character Jeff Anderson and Craig Robinson that really help because any scene without Banks  Rogen together has Robinson or Mewes who form a type of foundation for the great performances of Banks  Rogen. Of course the film features a few porn stars and a few cameos as well the best coming from Justin Long and Brandon Routh. I was dying.Of course not only do you get heart with Rogen and Smith but you get surefire jaw dropping jokes that will make you say did they really just do that?. One of the jokes I'm speaking of comes at Jeff Anderson's expense. The vulgarity of Rogen's comic style mixed with Smith's wicked fast writing is the perfect compliment and a great recipe for laughter. ZM certainly won't deliver as many laughs as films like Superbad or Knocked Up but that's mostly because the film is more serious desperate and shorter but of course still very light hearted.I guess the only thing I didn't like was the lack of resolution with the subplot of the actual porno but that's just wishful thinking as the end is more than satisfying as well as clever and hilarious. People are obviously going to be hesitant about seeing this movie because of the blunt title and risqu plot which in of itself is hilarious but these reluctant people need to realize that the sex is outweighed by the love and the raunch outweighed by the righteousness. Zack  Miri Make A Porno is one of the best romantic comedies of the decade as well as of the year. It's a fun sweet heartfelt raunchfest that will leave you laughing your ass off and having a good time. It's the perfect date movie if the person you're taking is receptive to the idea of seeing a movie like this.".

Not always uproariously funny but easily likable with a script that challenges viewers to keep track of enough sexually explicit dialogue for three films! Rogen and Banks have great chemistry. ";

And while Zack and Miri definitely contains a few scenes of Smith's trademark atrocities it never really hurdles over that line of decency that is practically expected nor does it relish in the typically volatile conversations notorious in his previous work. For better or for worse Zack and Miri just isn't that funny. And since it's coming from Kevin Smith the latter is more likely.Zack Seth Rogen and Miri Elizabeth Banks have been platonic friends for as long as they can remember. After heavy misuse of funds and a degrading revelation at their high school reunion the duo realizes they are in desperate need of money. In a mad scheme to alleviate the burden of their financial blunders they concoct a plan to make an adult movie. Recruiting a coworker Craig Robinson to produce an unscrupulous cameraman Jeff Anderson to film and a few uninhibited actors and actresses to perform Jason Mewes Traci Lords Katie Morgan Ricky Mabe everything seems to be going according to plan  until Miri finds herself falling for her costar.Ever since Clerks Smith has reveled in the art of crafting vulgar conversations mixed with a touch of humanity a helping of sincerity and almost no decency. With Zack and Miri the backandforth banter feels a little too forced as if Smith's characters curse just to add a little pronunciation to key words in the topics they discuss rather than allowing the subject matter to create the laughs for itself. Many of Zack's retorts to Miri feel unfulfilled and never fully exploited for their full comedic potential. The numerous gay jokes stale quickly the porn parodies are recycled and arguments with the temperamental coffee shop boss feel borrowed from early Apatow films. Smith's clever way with words does seep into a few conversations but not nearly enough.Smith is known for his outlandish and MPAAratingpushing dialogue. But in Zack and Miri Seth Rogen sounds like he wrote his lines himself spitting out the verbiage that we're familiar with from Knocked Up and Superbad. And Elizabeth Banks refrains from overly offbeat sexual conversations altogether. By the time the film wraps up with its incredibly commonplace boylosesgirl plot there are few genuine Kevin Smith laughs. In fact once the love story takes over around the midway point barely any humorous scenes exist at all. It's as if he forgot what makes his own films so popular.Zack and Miri Make a Porno provides a more tantalizing mental image than it visually paints on screen. The idea is stimulating but the execution is stale. Surrounding a musty love story with the principally clumsy and only occasionally sexy conception of pornography sounds interesting in theory. But only until that bland true love bit awkwardly surfaces. For it's the romance buried amidst the random vulgarities that the movie really wants to single out  unfortunately that's not the amusing part of Kevin Smith's filmmaking.The Massie Twins".

I wondered if this was truly a gem or another over hyped flick.You probably heard what this movie is about. Two life long best friends that live together and never had sex are put in a financial crunch and opt to make a porno to pay the bills. First off the idea that a man and woman that have known each other all their lives and live together not ever having sex comes off as unrealistic. I ignored this aspect and rolled with the film. The cast was looking pretty so I figured they'd crack me up.The movie opens with an American Pie sex comedy feel but with grown up losers instead. Seth Rogen play the same role he does in all his movies the high school dude that never grew up. No that I have anything against that because he does it well. Elizabeth Banks is the hotty best friend that's given up the booty to everyone except this poor sucker. Banks isn't very funny and her acting skills are forgettable.The first half of the money is fairly funny but nowhere near as good as Knocked Up. Early on the story is predictable Zack and Mari have a thing for each other and emotions will get tangled up when shooting a porn. By the mid point the entire movie turns into a full on love story at the major expense of the comedy factor. At this point it was hardly worth watching so I skipped around looking for some good parts.If you've seen all Rogen's majorly funny movies then don't waste your time on this one unless you're a hardcore fan. If you take out the sex the movie falls flat on it's face. Do yourself a favor and just watch a regular porn if that's the reason you're interested. Hopefully my review will save somebody a precious hour of their life.".

	schema:headline " Zack  Miri Make a Porno and also make you laugh";
	schema:reviewBody "It is difficult to imagine a title that will more or less tell you almost everything major that happens in the movie you are about to see than Zack  Miri Make a Porno. The title pretty much sums up the whole film right there in the broad strokes. But as with most things the meat is in the subtext. What the title doesn't tell you is that while making a porno Zack  Miri and their other accomplices will make you laugh pretty hard. Zack  Miri Make a Porno may not be high art but it is very funny movie with a touch of heart to go along with it.Zack Seth Rogen and Miri Elizabeth Banks have been best friends for as long as they can remember. They live together but in a completely platonic relationship drive to work together and both attend their school reunion together. Things are a bit rough for them these days though their rather meager jobs are not bringing in enough money to keep the rent paid and all the utilities running. So after running into an old classmate whose lover is the star of porno films in California they hit upon a brilliant scheme to make some money make a porno film.In short order they raise some capital from a coworker Craig Robinson recruit a stripper Stacey Katie Morgan Lester Jason Mewesa man who isn't afraid to expose himself a cameraman Jeff Anderson and Zack and Miri plan to round out the cast themselves. However in the process of getting down to business Zack and Miri are realizing that their longstanding friendship may actually be something more and can they manage to watch each other get it on with someone else after discovering that they may only want to be with each other.One thing is certain if you are not able to listen to frank jokes featuring almost every vulgar word in the English language not to mention a fair dose of nudity and simulated sex you should be looking elsewhere for an evening at the movies. Zack  Miri Make a Porno pulls few punches in these categories. If this is not an issue for you then Zack  Miri will provide a plethora of laughs. As scripted by Kevin Smith Zack  Miri is one hilarious joke after another most of which comes from Smith's always impressive ability to weave some terrific conversations full of wit between his various characters. Zack  Miri Make a Porno like all of Smith's best films is all about the dialogue and it works wonderfully as always.Seth Rogan is proving to be an actor who manages to give a performance that seems so completely unforced and natural. Zack like many of Rogan's other roles is a slice of life guy and Rogen manages to make it seem like you are just watching a friend that you filmed around the house with a video camera. Elizabeth Banks is equally good in the role of Miri and the two characters have a nice natural chemistry that evokes it's power when the two film their first sex scene for the porno which Smith stages tastefully and scores with a great unreleased song by Live. You know you care about what happens to these characters once this scene hits.The supporting cast is strong especially Robinson as Zack's coworker who is principally interested in financing this film so he can see some women naked after being married for so long A scene between his character and his wife late in the film is a riot and Jason Mewes no longer under the influence of drugs proves that he will do almost anything in a film and gets plenty of laughs.Zack  Miri Make a Porno is Kevin Smith's second turn at a film outside of his View Askewniverse series of films that he kicked off with Clerks and it shows that Smith has ability to produce a funny film without exclusively relying on his old standby characters. In the process of doing so he has crafted something that if you can handle the racy nature of the material will leave you in stitches.".

However in the process of getting down to business Zack and Miri are realizing that their longstanding friendship may actually be something more and can they manage to watch each other get it on with someone else after discovering that they may only want to be with each other.One thing is certain if you are not able to listen to frank jokes featuring almost every vulgar word in the English language not to mention a fair dose of nudity and simulated sex you should be looking elsewhere for an evening at the movies. Zack  Miri Make a Porno pulls few punches in these categories. If this is not an issue for you then Zack  Miri will provide a plethora of laughs. As scripted by Kevin Smith Zack  Miri is one hilarious joke after another most of which comes from Smith's always impressive ability to weave some terrific conversations full of wit between his various characters. Zack  Miri Make a Porno like all of Smith's best films is all about the dialogue and it works wonderfully as always.Seth Rogan is proving to be an actor who manages to give a performance that seems so completely unforced and natural. Zack like many of Rogan's other roles is a slice of life guy and Rogen manages to make it seem like you are just watching a friend that you filmed around the house with a video camera. Elizabeth Banks is equally good in the role of Miri and the two characters have a nice natural chemistry that evokes it's power when the two film their first sex scene for the porno which Smith stages tastefully and scores with a great unreleased song by Live. You know you care about what happens to these characters once this scene hits.The supporting cast is strong especially Robinson as Zack's coworker who is principally interested in financing this film so he can see some women naked after being married for so long A scene between his character and his wife late in the film is a riot and Jason Mewes no longer under the influence of drugs proves that he will do almost anything in a film and gets plenty of laughs.Zack  Miri Make a Porno is Kevin Smith's second turn at a film outside of his View Askewniverse series of films that he kicked off with Clerks and it shows that Smith has ability to produce a funny film without exclusively relying on his old standby characters. In the process of doing so he has crafted something that if you can handle the racy nature of the material will leave you in stitches.";

	schema:reviewBody "I feel like I should let everyone reading this know of the bias I had in favor of this film going in. In spite of my dislike of Mallrats Jersey Girl and even Clerks II which didn't gel into a cohesive whole for me although it featured several great individual scenes I have always liked Kevin Smith as a person based not only on his podcast and QA sessions but on my one admittedly short personal meeting with him. I have also always liked Smith as a writer and still count Clerks as one of the most truetolife funniest and most genuinely inspired screenplays ever written and all his other movies despite being more flawed in my estimation have something or the other to recommend in them Chasing Amy being his best outside Clerks. Also influencing my opinion of the film is the fact that if you put Zack in an arthouse theater instead of a coffee shop and showed him RobbeGrillet movies he would basically be me. It also happens that the relationship between Zack and Miri platonic roommates who have known each other for a long time is an exact reflection of my own relationship with my roommate. With all that covered does Zack and Miri Make a Porno meet my lofty expectations?In spite of some forced and unfunny gay and race jokes it certainly does. I'm almost surprised by it as I thought there was no way it could meet my expectations. The most instantly noticeable thing about Zack and Miri Make a Porno is how good the film looks. Throughout his career Smith has been criticized for his skills as director or lack thereof and surprisingly Smith has been one of his biggest critics. On a SModcast episode recently Smith said that he and David Klein his cinematographer had really worked hard at making this look like a 'real movie' perhaps not the exact words but it was something like that. The effort really has paid off. Zack and Miri Make a Porno is a genuinely wellshot film there's none of the awkwardness and amateurishness of some of Smith's other movies and if Smith himself says that he thinks of himself as 'not a real filmmaker' then he should reevaluate himself because he has really achieved something quite surprising here. The screenplay is no disappointment either. In spite of as I said earlier some forced and unfunny race and gay humor Zack and Miri Make a Porno still features characters who feel like real people something Smith has always been able to do and some really inspired dialogue and even some wellexecuted sight gags this time around. Oh it's absolutely filthy of course but there's real heart here and where I personally think Clerks II failed at bringing vulgarity and romance together into a cohesive whole Zack and Miri Make a Porno does exactly that including in the film's key scene between Zack and Miri which also features a LOST joke! Did Kevin Smith make this movie for me?!The plot is pretty much what you should expect going in. It's a romantic comedy centered around the making of a porn film to help the two leads get out of a financial crisis. The movie is hardly unpredictable but it's wellwritten enough to survive the familiar conventional outcome. You can't expect something as unconventional as Chasing Amy although this movie might be more consistent and hence better which was a romantic comedy set in a geeknerd world with such accurate reflection of the people I know and the life I live that it remains a favorite of mine in spite of its rough visual look and some bad acting but Zack and Miri Make a Porno is so wellwritten and contains such genuine emotion that it overcomes all the hurdles which a romantic comedy faces.The acting is certainly a big part of the movie's success. No offense to Joey Lauren Adams but Elizabeth Banks has the skill and presence to carry a film like Adams could only hope to and is a surprisingly great comedienne. Seth Rogen is an affable goofball as he usually is and Craig Robinson is... Craig Robinson. The two big surprises here are Jason Mewes who plays a character quite different from Jay very well. There's no real emotional acting for him here but he's really hilarious and solid here and Katie Morgan ! who doesn't have much to do but is a surprisingly decent comedic actress who may actually have a mainstream career in her future.Some critics have accused Zack and Miri Make a Porno of being sappy. I don't know if it's just my being able to identify with Zack so much and my having a Miri of my own but I felt like the film ended up being genuinely sweet and not sappy. It made me laugh it nearly made me cry and it left me feeling very satisfied by the end. Easily Smith's most satisfying movie since Chasing Amy possibly since Clerks and with the move away from Jersey away from the View Askewniverse it sees Kevin Smith maturing as a director and yet still delivering something that's very much a 'Kevin Smith' movie just a more accomplished version of one. Before this I thought his horror project Red State would be a disaster after this I'm actually thinking he can pull it off.8.510".

One of these guys Routh is so handsome and charming Miri crudely and of course futilely propositions him on the spot. Zack happens to talk to his lover Long hilariously deepvoiced and confident. It turns out the gay men produce and act in their own profitable line of gay porn films. They really are goodlooking and have it together and Zack and Miri being so broke their electricity and water have been cut off decide to make a porno of their own. The plot twist obvious in conventional romantic comedy terms is that the process of shooting a sex scene with them in it makes Zack and Miri who we don't know exactly why have contented themselves with hasty meaningless sex with others up to now realizeafter a slight delaythat they've really loved each other along.Smith's use of Seth Rogen in a schlubwinsprettygirl comedy there's no doubt that Elizabeth Banks is pretty links him with Judd Apatow's productions but let's hope he isn't swallowed up by the Apatow factory. Apatow can do anything but in spite of the success of 'Knocked Up' 'Super Bad' 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' and 'Pineapple Express' I wish he'd go back to producing really good failed TV series like 'Freaks and Geeks' and 'Undeclared' where Seth got started and Judd gave birth to all the good comedy.Kevin Smith's continuing appeal is his own. It lies in his faithfulness to his New Jersey Askewniverse regional workingclass outlook and in his ability to call a spade a spade spade in this case being a string of fourletter words. He has never strayed far from his basic concerns even when more money came his way as it did as soon as his under30000 debut production 'Clerks' was snapped up by Miramax and feted at Sundance and Cannes. Smith's movies are frank and contemporary outrageous and funny. Above all they're sui generis a quality achieved through adhering closely to favorite tropes and locales and a posse of pals.His deadend mallrats entering their thirties without accomplishment or future speak truth and the best things about his movies has always been the dialogue which is spiky and arresting and nonstop and alive even if he avoids polish so studiously that the lines aren't as memorable as they might be. Or is it just that I'm too old to be fully tuned in to the language even though I understand it? Relationships and situations get honest treatment even though they're hardly explored in depth. He's also good at politics and religion as in 'Dogma' which took things a step beyond 'Clerks.' Raised as an Irish Catholic Smith delighted in insulting the Church but the Catholic League didn't take his provocations lightly. Sometimes drawing on Ben Afleck and Matt Damon and other celebs he's kept going back to the same crew of actorfriends and characters including Jason Lee Brian O'Halloran Mr. Affleck Betty Aberlin Jeff Anderson Walter Flanagan Ernest O'Donnell or course Kevin Smith himself Silent Bob and my own favorite and the most frequent of all the provocative yet needy Jason Mewes. Smith's last movie was 'Clerks II' which much like Zack highlighted a sexually outrageous act in a shoddy fast food joint. A good addition here is Zack's black cohort from his place of work Delaney Craig Robinson of the US TV The Office who has great timing and delivery and becomes the porno's producer.In a way Zack even directly reenacts what Smith actually did when he shot 'Clerks'he made a movie at night in the New Jersey convenience store where he was then working in the daytime. The crew in Zack wind up making their porno at night in the nonStarbucks coffee shop called BeanNGone where Zack and Delaney work. Predictably a guy Tyler Labine comes in in the wee hours to buy a cup of coffee so he can drive home. He's so drunk he doesn't notice that one of the new porn recruits and Jason Mewes are having sex on a platform in front of the counter. This time even though it's put off and partly an afterthought the main characters not only find love but success in free enterprisewith their friends.Smith's dialogue never falters. But I confess to an increasing nostalgia for the purity and simplicity of the original Clerks. That had a promise a sense of how ordinary guys could be witty and smart a sense that though nothing was happening something momentous still might. It hasn't. 'Zack and Miri' doesn't take us any further than 'Clerks II' did I think 'Clerks II' even had cleverer dialogue. This time downanddirty language is beginning to feel wearisome. It's beginning to feel forced. People don't talk that way all the timeat least women don't. But that doesn't mean Smith's fans are burned out. The Weinstein brothers have picked up this one and nobody's going to lose any money. Last time I compared Kevin Smith to Eric Rohmer. That may seem far fetched at first due to Rohmer's delicacy vs. Smith's grossout factor. But both filmmakers are essentially perpetual adolescents who write good dialogue. Both of them go back to the same themes every time. Rohmer doesn't make a masterpiece every time and neither does Smith. But you keep coming back. I still like this vulgarian indie auteur.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay woah woah woah. I am sorry but I do not understand how anyone could enjoy this movie.Maybe I am just disappointed. It was a Kevin Smith film with Seth Rogen and I had VERY high expectations. For some reason my friend and I rented the movie thinking it would be about a married couple with some money problems that decided to make a porno for the money. But as soon as I found out they were best friends that roomed together I knew everything that was going to happen. Really Kevin Smith? Are you going to be THAT clich? So once I found out how unoriginal the movie would be I already knew I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.Then it got worse. There's a difference between being vulgar and witty and being just plain vulgar. This movie was an example of the second. To the point where it was disturbing. It showed people actually having sex. It showed a girl pooping on the camera. Was is funny? No. Was it clever? No. Was it overdone? Yes. Could the movie have survived without it? Definitely. Oh wait but then again if you took those scenes out there would probably only be about 30 minutes of an actual movie. Whoever laughed at those scenes has a sense of humor that belongs on the dollar menu at McDonald's because those jokes were CHEAP.And Smith had the NERVE to even try and squeeze a cute little romance plot in it? NO. NO NO NO NO NO. I am sorry but either you are targeting an audience that likes to see straight up filth or you are targeting an audience that falls for that cheesy loveydovey bull. Don't even try and interrupt one with the other. Like I said I could tolerate the romance if it wasn't so predictable and clich.Not just that but the characters were so undefined. So is Miri a slut? Is she just one of the guys? Is she an embarrassing loser? Is she a vulnerable dame? It was like the writers wanted to combine every lovable trait in a protagonist into one but it doesn't work that way. And it was so pathetic the way every other character in the movie was just this exaggerated obnoxious unrealistic mess besides Zach and Miri. Was that another tactic used to make the audience love the protagonists? Again FAIL.This movie was a mess. If it didn't have all these big names involved then I think we all know the other reviews would look a little different. I give this a one star and that's being generous.".

But as soon as I found out they were best friends that roomed together I knew everything that was going to happen. Really Kevin Smith? Are you going to be THAT clich? So once I found out how unoriginal the movie would be I already knew I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.Then it got worse. There's a difference between being vulgar and witty and being just plain vulgar. This movie was an example of the second. To the point where it was disturbing. It showed people actually having sex. It showed a girl pooping on the camera. Was is funny? No. Was it clever? No. Was it overdone? Yes. Could the movie have survived without it? Definitely. Oh wait but then again if you took those scenes out there would probably only be about 30 minutes of an actual movie. Whoever laughed at those scenes has a sense of humor that belongs on the dollar menu at McDonald's because those jokes were CHEAP.And Smith had the NERVE to even try and squeeze a cute little romance plot in it? NO. NO NO NO NO NO. I am sorry but either you are targeting an audience that likes to see straight up filth or you are targeting an audience that falls for that cheesy loveydovey bull. Don't even try and interrupt one with the other. Like I said I could tolerate the romance if it wasn't so predictable and clich.Not just that but the characters were so undefined. So is Miri a slut? Is she just one of the guys? Is she an embarrassing loser? Is she a vulnerable dame? It was like the writers wanted to combine every lovable trait in a protagonist into one but it doesn't work that way. And it was so pathetic the way every other character in the movie was just this exaggerated obnoxious unrealistic mess besides Zach and Miri. Was that another tactic used to make the audience love the protagonists? Again FAIL.This movie was a mess. If it didn't have all these big names involved then I think we all know the other reviews would look a little different. I give this a one star and that's being generous.";

I liked the guy because he never tried to impress the girl he was just himself even when it was painful and difficult to do so and I liked the girl because once you got past her looks you found an interesting person underneath.The other big reason I liked it was because it managed to take one of the oldest romantic clichs everracing to the airport to declare your love before that Perfect Someone leavesand put a nice twist on it. Kudos to the writers on that one that alone was worth several points on this scale.This is actually one of the better movies I've seen this year I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Molly Alice Eve is a sexy event planner who is delayed by a sleazy airport security guard. Another security guard Kirk Jay Baruchel comes to her rescue and passes her through to catch her plane. Luckily Kirk finds Molly's phone that she left behind and from the plane Molly calls her phone and invites Kirk to a party to return her phone when she returns. Kirk is smitten by Molly but his friends point out to him that he doesn't have a chance because he is only rated as a 5 and Molly is definitely a 10. And as everybody knows you can only date a girl who is only 2 above your score so that means Kirk can only successfully date a 7. However Molly has something else in mind because she has found that Kirk is sweet amusing honest and different from the men she has been dating. Kirk on the other hand has one big insecurity problem Kirk believes Molly will dump him as soon as she realizes her mistake. Under these circumstances and everything working against Kirk and Molly is it possible for them to build a relationship that will bloom and flourish? My Comment This is an unlikely love story that is a really sweet romantic comedy. You would think that it is a women's movie but it actually is a guy's movie because it gives the 5s of the world the belief that they have a chance to catch and have a relationship with a 10. The trailers portray that there are a lot of raunchy sex scenes in the movie but actually it is more your imagination then the real thing. The story does show and prove that a person with low self esteem will have a hard time in life fulfilling his dream. Hopefully people who saw this movie will take this lesson of life to heart and go for the gold or in this case a 10. Jay Baruchel's performance as the quirky geek was right on target and Alice Eve's portrayal of Molly made her very likable. Both actors characterization of the low selfimage problem was very believable. This is one of those hilariously funny love stories that could be a sleeper hit. I laughed throughout the whole movie and left the movie in a happy mood. Paramount Run Time 144 Rated R710".

The actors all do a fantastic job with their parts and you can easily identify with most of them. No over the top characters ever do a hostile takeover of the plot. This movie is probably a notch below movies like The Hangover The 40 Year Old Virgin and Wedding Crashers but it definitely holds it own and you will most definitely find yourself laughing hard more than once.

I mean Role Models2008 hardly had anybody likable in it and it was a big hit and i'm still trying to figure that one out. But this film had two likable leads that you wanna route for.KirkJay Baruchel from Knocked Up works at at an airport he's a nice guy but painfully shy and insecure. His buddies that he works with say thats because women don't consider him boyfriend material cause he is too safe. But all that changes one day when the ever so enchantingly beautiful MollyAlice Eve forgets her cell phone while boarding a plane she uses her friends cell phone to call her cell phone and Kirk finds it and answers it she asks him can he hold it for her. Kirk brings it back to her Alice soon wants to spend more time with Kirk. But will Kirk insecurities ruin it? The critics are quick to bash this movie but give Role Models a thumbs up go figure. I liked Jay Baruchel and Alice Eve they where characters to route for and where very enjoyable to watch although Baruchel was more funnier then Eve the comedy just happened around her. Lindsay SloaneBig Red from Bring It On is also good has Marnie Kirks ex. Krysten Ritter is also amusing as Patty Mollys friend. But the real scene stealer IS T.J. Miller has Kirks friend Stainer who steals almost every moment when every scene he is in he's like Jason Segal and Seth Rogen mixed together.I say don't listen to the critics see this movie and form your own opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes ads can be misleading. It's like when you see an attractive person from far away and the closer they get the less attractive they become. The ads are selling a raunchy sex comedy where the hot lead actress is going to take her top off. That isn't the case however. Yes there is a makeout scene between the two stars where the male lead...has an accident. And there's also a shaving scene that will rival the one from the third American Pie. Aside from those two scenes and a few others the movie is actually a really sweet romantic comedy.It's about Molly Alice Eve a sexy event planner who gets harassed at the airport by a sleazy employee. Luckily Kirk Jay Baruchel another employee comes to her rescue. Kirk is dopeylooking skinny and a bit of a pushover. He's a 5 according to his friends. Yet Molly whose a hard 10 finds him amusing and a perfect gentlemen. Soon to the surprise of many they start dating. They like each other and get along fine but their friends keep questioning the relationship and giving them selfdoubt. Kirk is constantly reminded that he's a 5 and she's a 10. It goes against all logic. Molly is constantly reminded that she only went out with him in the first place because he is safe. Her previous boyfriend also a 10 broke her heart and now she's with someone whose in no position to do that. So does she really like or love him? If there's one flaw to this film it's that the filmmakers or studio went for the Rrating just for the sake of appearing edgy during the marketing. Anyone expecting The 40YearOld Virgin is going to be disappointed. Although the raunchy scenes are funny. They just stick out and disrupt the tone. In a way this movie is like The Girl Next Door. Elisha Cuthbert played a porn star that needs to be rescued by her nerdy next door neighbor Emile Hirsch. Yet she's not naked and doesn't do any wild sex scenes. It's a waste of a concept. A regular PG13 comedy about two teenagers from opposite worlds that fall in love would have been just fine. It wouldn't have sold any tickets but it would have been honest. So remember if you decide to see this film it's pretty tame and a lot more girly than the ads are willing to admit. It's a really good date movie but not one you want to see only with your friends.".

Even though Kirk's personality in the movie isn't particularly remarkable. You actually start to believe their friends when they're constantly telling them that they're not going to work as a couple. The inevitable circumstances that cause problems for them seem extremely forced and predictable as is their eventual reunion. There's little imagination involved in the story that's for sure.It probably seems like I didn't particularly like the movie but I did.

Kirk is out of shape uncoordinated not college graduate has never been in Europe and drives a shitbox Neon. His friends are a bunch of losers that also work at the airport and use to rank themselves and women. His family does not support him and his father used his college money to build a large swimming pool in the backyard of their house. Kirk dreams on becoming an airplane pilot but he is insecure and without selfesteem. He also misses his former girlfriend Marnie Lindsay Sloane who is a bitch that humiliate him all the time. One day the gorgeous Molly McCleish Alice Eve is helped by him in the checkin to a flight to New York but she forgets her iphone and Kirk holds it for her. On the next day Molly invites Kirk to go to a party at the Andy Warhol Museum and he delivers her iphone to her. Sooner they date and he learns that she is a successful promoter of events that lives in a fancy apartment and drives a nice car. However the lack of confidence of Kirk does not let him see that Molly loves him since she is totally out of his league. The delightful She's Out of My League is one of the funniest comedies I have recently seen. Jay Baruchel is hilarious in the role of a man that has no selfesteem and selfconfidence to be happy with one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen Alice Eve who is really a pretty woman. Alice Eve was ranked 7 in 2010 in the Beautiful Famous Faces by The Annual Independent Critics List of the 100 Most Beautiful Famous Faces From Around the World. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Ela  Demais para Mim She is Out of My League".

This seems to be the writing teams knack and they're proving to rival the likes of Judd Apatow and Kevin Smith which previously had the market cornered on intelligent yet crude and vulgar comedies that also prove to be well made and heart felt character studies as well.The duo at least so far have also centered on subject matter revolving around the social outcast 'loveable loser' finally winning out and succeeding in life most notably by winning over the girl of his dreams who's way out of his league. This is probably a really relateable subject matter for their target audience which is why their films at least the first two have been such a success. Sort of the same area of expertise Smith and Apatow also have and have had great success in.This movie fits the writing team's known formula to a T and tells the story of a pretty average looking 'loveable loser' named Kirk played by Jay Baruchel a known Apatow collaborator who manages to impress a stunningly beautiful woman named Molly played by newcomer Alice Eve with his kindness. Molly's on the rebound from a bad breakup with a cocky good looking pilot played by Geoff Stults and due to the fact that Kirk seems 'safe' and harmless she asks him out. The two actually hit it off but due to Kirk's lack of confidence due in large part to his best friends' constant put downs and demoralizing abuse which is probably a relateable subject for a lot of target viewers as well  it is for me he loses faith in himself and unintentionally sabotages his chances with her.The movie is actually a pretty smart and clever character study and it's definitely inspiring although it is also pretty far fetched that a ten would go for a five as the movie's tagline states. Despite the insight and heart the movie does deliver on all the low brow belly laughs that the previews promise and there's a lot of really clever 'Smithesque' dialog as well. Soon to be a comedy classic!Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vj95Zjdlcbe0".

He's actually a nice guy and she falls for him. However his friend Stainer has been driving home the message that he is way below her status both socially and in terms of looks and it will never succeed and her friend Patty has been doing the same with her. This eventually drives them apart at which point the friends realise the mistake they've made and conspire to bring them together again.I'm not familiar with Jay Baruchel Kirk other than as the voice of the main character in How To Train Your Dragon. But on the basis of She's Out Of My League he appears to be vying with Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg for the position of Selfdenigrating Loser Unlikely Romantic Hero.And he is doing so quite successfully in this case because the object of his affections is played by Alice Eve another performer with whom I am unfamiliar but about whom I will say she is very attractive of course that's the point of the movie and she has a great smile. I wasn't familiar with much of the supporting cast either but they were all good  interestingly Molly's parents are played by her real life parents English actors Trevor Shoestring Eve and Sharon Gold Blend commercials Maughan. I particularly liked Krysten Ritter as Molly's friend Patty and Debra Jo Rupp as Kirk's mother.As is the modern fashion there is a fair amount of bad language and some concentration on bodily functions one of which gives rise to one of the funniest sequences in the film. But these are nice people and it's quite a sweet story and the ruderies fit quite well so I didn't mind that much.I liked this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the trailer for She's Out of my League I have to admit that I laughed but I was thinking that if I had seen this movie it would probably be a let down. One of those you saw the funny parts in the trailer movies. But still I saw the movie just keeping my expectations low as most romantic comedies are just awful. Much to my pleasant surprise She's Out of My League was a really funny movie that I enjoyed very much. In a society obsessed with looks and being perfect most romantic comedies have these gorgeous people in the leads who don't look like they need any help in their love lives we finally get a lead who isn't drop dead gorgeous as for Hollywood standards getting a beautiful person. Though I do wish we could have a romantic comedy with the opposite not so hot girl gets the hot guy I guess we'll have to wait a while for that. But She's Out of My League does deliver in the laughs and entertainment with great chemistry with our two leads and supporting cast.Kirk is in his mid20s who has a low selfesteem and by his own admission has not accomplished very much in life. He works at the Pittsburgh International Airport as a security officer and has very few goals other than trying to get back together with his selfcentered exgirlfriend Marnie. Marnie ended her relationship with Kirk two years ago and is highly dismissive of his continued romantic interests. However she has remained close with Kirk's parents and overbearing brother and continues to participate in family activities along with her new boyfriend. With no relationship and an awkward family life Kirk confides in his three close male friends who also work with him at the airport. Then at work one morning a strikingly beautiful woman named Molly arrives at the passenger terminal for a flight to New York. She and Kirk exchange a few smiles and flirtatious words and she then proceeds to her flight accidentally leaving her iPhone in the airport security area. Upon realizing she has misplaced it Molly calls her phone and Kirk back at the security checkpoint answers. To everyone's surprise Molly really likes Kirk his friends constantly remind him he's a 5 and she's a 10 so he feels the pressure to keep her around.What I liked most about this movie was how it wasn't a COMPLETE clich Molly's hot ex wants her back but he doesn't go through outrageous attempts to get her back or anything he's just as insecure as our leading male. It turns out that the only reason why Kirk is uncomfortable dating Molly is because he is reminded on a daily basis on how average he is and how he'll never get a gorgeous or sophisticated woman like Molly. A lot of people can relate to that heck how many times on the street do we see an unattractive looking person with someone who is really good looking and make a judgment? I loved how even his family were a bunch of jerks and not the typical we're rooting for our son mentality they actually almost preferred his ex's new boyfriend over him how sad is that? She's Out of My League is a big recommendation from me definitely worth the rental when it comes out it's one of the better romantic comedies that I've seen.710".

OK then let me start reviewing this movie. Firstly the starting itself told me that this movie was going to be something I've watched a million times before. An overview of the city while a dumb song plays. How original. I'm sure you've read the plot if you're reading this review. A very good looking girl falls for a very average 'nice' guy. There are many things that are wrong with this movie. Firstly the music. It's really annoying to hear a radio friendly pop rock song in every other scene in a movie that's not even related to music. Secondly the humour. If you've watched any modern mainstream non romantic comedy you know what to expect here. It consists of swearing more swearing and sexual innuendos. I do not find swearing at an elderly man who does not deserve to be sworn at funny. I don't see why anyone over the age of 13 would find premature ejaculation which was supposed to be one of the funniest jokes of the movie amusing at all. Showing middle fingers pointless profanity shaving pubic hair... I mean seriously? Do they really expect people to laugh at this? It's the same recycled bull we've been seeing for a long long time started by movies like 'Revenge Of the Nerds' These jokes sucked even then!Other than the worthless humour we have tons of pseudo drama involved here. Just before the ending there is the formulatic 'sad' part just like every other 'comedy' movie nowadays. There is a dumb moral to be learnt at the end too. And apparently all people are rated by numbers from 110 or something and everyone and I mean everyone knows about this rating system. The characters are people I really don't care about. And the ending well it's your typical Hollywood 'everything's fine and peachy' ending.What can I say? There is nothing smart witty entertaining original or redeemable about this movie. It's just another pile of crap Hollywood has put out and will keep putting until people stop watching or at least paying. So please for the love of decent cinema do not pay for this or other generic movies so those evil greedy men in business suits can realize that enough is enough.".

It's a typical clich he meets she and she's out of his league movie. Oh hey isn't that the title? LOL As expected they ignore the odds and get together. You'll have to watch the movie for anything more but I guess I'll just repeat a few times that it did exactly what I expected and it did it well! Will definitely watch it again. I have to write ten lines about the movie but that's a pretty ridiculous requirement just for a quick review. No wonder there are so few reviews except for those ridiculous long reviews that nobody is going to read. People just want to know how you feel about a movie. If you want details about the movie you read one of those novels that people with no life write but if you want the simple truth  watch the movie and you will love it.".

It's a typical clich he meets she and she's out of his league movie. Oh hey isn't that the title? LOL As expected they ignore the odds and get together. You'll have to watch the movie for anything more but I guess I'll just repeat a few times that it did exactly what I expected and it did it well! Will definitely watch it again. I have to write ten lines about the movie but that's a pretty ridiculous requirement just for a quick review. No wonder there are so few reviews except for those ridiculous long reviews that nobody is going to read. People just want to know how you feel about a movie. If you want details about the movie you read one of those novels that people with no life write but if you want the simple truth  watch the movie and you will love it.";

	schema:reviewBody "It would have been really easy to miss this movie. You tend to get a few different romantic comedies a year and most of them filter into static. Unless you're a really big fan of the genre for me at least romantic comedies are fine but they aren't my genre of choice they go in one ear and out the other. Every so often one seems to stick Morning Glory About Last Night and Definitely Maybe would be my other picks from the last few years and this was one of those movies for me. Some funny dialogue characters that you can relate to and a genuinely sweet relationship go a long way and that's why I'm coming back to review this movie Minor Spoilers Ahead We join Kirk Jay Baruchel as he's rehearsing a speech to try and convince his exgirlfriend Marnie Lindsay Sloane to get back together with him. Instead of being supportive his group of friends Stainer T.J. Miller Mike Vogel Jack and Devon Nate Torrence take turns roasting him on why it's a terrible idea. They mock Kirk for being unattractive and try to tell him getting back together is a mistake. Kirk's lonely since their breakup however and brushes his friends off as being resentful because they weren't big fans of MarnieThe movie flashes ahead to Kirk actually giving Marnie the speech and a crappy piece of jewellery. To Kirk's horror she not only turns him down but refuses to leave because she's grown attached to Kirk's family. She's got a new boyfriend who also hangs around Ron Hayes MacArthur and it turns out minus his mom Debra Jo Rupp his entire family are a bunch of jerks.Kirk heads off to work at the airport as TSA and a beautiful woman walks in. Her name is Molly Alice Eve and everyone starts to stare when she passes by. Despite her friendly demeanour she gets some unwanted attention from Kirk's boss. Kirk helps her out and gets her on her way. Once she boards she realizes she left her phone back in security. Kirk answers her call from her friend's phone and she promises to meet up with him once she gets back from her trip.If you read the plot summary it seems pretty average. I would agree with that criticism but the characters pick up the slack. I found it easy to identify with Kirk he's stuck in a dead end job and he wants more but he's just as confused as the audience when this beautiful woman pays attention to him. He's an average guy but he's also easy to root for. Molly is also a great character you find out she has her own motivations for being interested in Kirk but she's impressive inside and out. She's cool and she's not shallow at all and she and Kirk are good for each other. The side characters like Stainer and Devon don't have much development but they're there more for the comedy than to add to the plot. I also think that the movie comes to a nice conclusion sure it has the feel good aspect but they keep it funny and it achieves a good balance. She's Out of My League has a good message as well it's nothing new but it has some relevance today about how the important thing is being selfconfident and not underestimating your chances and who you are.Most comedies rely a lot on adlibbing but they can't hold up over the course of the movie. I found that this movie did excel in that area. Having some great comedians like Jay Baruchel and T.J. Miller pay off for the movie the dialogue whether it was scripted or not was hilarious. Comedy is subjective and there is some stuff here that won't work for everyone there's some gross out humour but they don't overdo it but I've seen this movie more than a few times and I laugh a lot every single viewing.When I talk about the cast I look back on this movie and I struggle to see why this movie didn't lead to bigger things for the bigger stars of She's Out of My League. T.J. Miller is on Silicon Valley and Krysten Ritter is the star of Jessica Jones and they're both pretty good here. I think this movie shows that Jay Baruchel can carry a comedy by himself. He's often hanging out with Seth Rogen and the gang This is the End is a crazy funny comedy but he does a solid job as the lead in this movie. I also think that Alice Eve shines here much like Margot Robbie or Emma Stone she's gorgeous but she shows a lot of charisma and she's funny in certain scenes. She might not be on their level but there are shades of that here. I would have thought she'd be grabbing higher profile projects but I can't imagine that most people would walk away with bad things to say after watching this movie. Lindsay Sloane is also a riot she bounces off Baruchel and Miller really well and completely holds her own.I would never claim that this movie is a landmark in cinema or that it reinvents the romantic comedy genre but for me it's a really funny movie with a sweet enough relationship at the centre of it. I like the characters the jokes the actorsactresses and it's held up pretty well after multiple viewings. I can't ask for much more than that and if you're in the mood for something like this it's definitely worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "When 'She's Out of My League' was released I had never heard of it. In fact I only heard about it three years later when I saw the first 10 minutes on TV. After that 10 minutes I was interested so I bought the DVD primarily because I dislike not seeing movie endings and was very pleasantly surprised at the outcome.I thought 'She's Out of My League' was excellent. For a movie that has taken so many used ideas it manages to blend everything together perfectly into a semicrude but always cheerful romantic comedy about a regular Joe named Kirk and his struggles when he meets and dates Molly a girl who is seemingly way higher up than he on almost every scale.I think the main strength of this movie was the characters  prior to seeing it I'd never heard of any of them nor seen any movies they'd been in and I was able to get into the story much better than had it been filled with Hollywood Alisters. The writing was sound though the ideas were all very formulaic and horribly predictable however in the end I found that it didn't matter anyway. The withdrawn and kind nature of Kirk combined with the idiocy and loyalty of his mismatched group of friends meant that I couldn't help but love the transition Kirk made from bumbling loser to confident boyfriend of a woman likely to be the hottest girl in the city.Some people seemed to have issues with the vulgar nature of some of the movie though personally I didn't. I thought most scenes were very funny and though swearing occurs here and there I thought that most of the comedic scenes were clever enough in construction that they didn't actively detract from the love story going on around them.All in all I was very surprised after watching this movie. I expected that it might be another average romantic comedy that I'd watch a couple of times and then it would wear off but instead this movie is full of emotion and offers a lot of heart and feeling something sorely missing in many other films. I'll also specially mention the soundtrack which I personally consider to be one of the best I've heard to date well using songs that weren't made for the movie. Yes the airport scene at the end is horribly clich but I can't help but smile every time I hear the opening guitar of Jet's 'Cold Hard B' as Molly goes chasing after Kirk. Great Stuff.".

Good warm humor written throughout this film. Friggin' funny! I did see this on video so it does have an R rating and that is for the really stupid parts that in my opinion were totally out of place for this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I apologize in advance for not noting the names of the characters and their respective actors. It's been a few days and there really wasn't anyone in this movie that had a great performance or had done much else I've seen in the pastI don't expect much from movies like this. Movies are so hit and miss nowadays it's hard to expect a lot from a comedy with a not so original premise and not much fanfare. Not that a movie needs to be hyped to be good far from it but I think you know what I mean.This movie fills the minimum quota of laughs and they're spread out pretty evenly throughout the film. It's somewhat juvenile but that should be expected going in. Regardless if you feel you're above that don't bother. The rest of the movie is fine it's just not very original.The answer to why this girl is going out of her way for the main character isn't really convincing. She's dated attractive meatheads her whole life and wants to go in the complete opposite direction. Okay that's clich but I can accept that. The thing is there's pretty much zero chemistry between the two characters and no realistic arc of them getting together. She just picks him because he's not a gorgeous narcissist and that's it. She admits as much later on but it still doesn't explain why she puts up with so many strange things his family puts her through or his particularly unusual lack of selfesteem. I mean near the end of the movie it seems like it's been months since they started dating and for some reason he still can't believe she likes him and still isn't comfortable being around her. That's very hard for the viewer to believe and if he really was THAT devoid of selfesteem there's no way she would have ever even taken a shot at going out with him. I know it's just a comedy but a little believability on the part of the actors would have been nice. You get what you pay for in this case I suppose.The only other complaint I had was that the ending was not only a clich that's been done a thousand times but that it was drug out for far too long. At least make it quick if you're going to make us sit through something we've seen a bunch of times before.The movie made me laugh and I was glad I watched it once. That's a success in my book. I just think with a little more polish it would have been a smoother ride.One minor note One reason I wanted to see this is because I'm a native Pittsburgher and a big Penguin fan. I was a little disappointed they just made up player names like Reese and Fox. I mean come on They got a bunch of Penguins to appear in that Van Damme movie Sudden Death. It would've been nice for them to get just one player even a nobody for the sake of a little authenticity. Very minor complaint though obviously. I have actually been to the Brillo Box the place where the party near the end is held. I don't believe the inside is the same place. The actual place is much much smaller.".

	schema:reviewBody "The titular heroine of the Dardenne brothers latest movie is Lorna a recent immigrant to Belgium who spends her days earning paychecks from a drycleaners while earning more substantial money by selling herself off as a bride to a Russian man looking to immigrate to Belgium himself. Before she can marry the Russian however Lorna must obtain a divorce from her current husband Claudy a brokendown pathetic drugaddict who only married Lorna in order to obtain the cash to fund his habit. The relationship between the young couple is complicated. Lorna with a boyfriend back home and another potential husband eager to obtain Belgian citizenship waiting in the wings has no romantic attachment to Claudy. Early scenes show her disgust and impatience for her lazy feeble husband who does little more then shootup play cards and follow her around like a puppydog. Nevertheless she can't help but feel sympathy towards the man she is using solely to obtain her citizenship. Claudy's feelings are equally muddled. He is aware that Lorna is using him and yet is devastated when she talks about divorce. He plays on his weaknesses to illicit Lorna's sympathy and then plagues her with childish demands. Their relationship masterfully played out by Arta Dobroshi and returning Dardenne brother favourite Jrmie Renier is utterly intensely fascinating. They're both the victims and the aggressors in their relationship and who you root for and who you find repulsive flips frequently from scene to scene.But the movie isn't focused on the relationship between Claudy and Lorna. As Lorna struggles to earn her money quickly she is forced to choose between protecting Claudy whose desire to kick his drughabit is problematic for her divorce proceedings and her desire to protect her own small dream of owning a caf with her longdistance boyfriend. Her optimism and strength are quickly torn apart when the man responsible for arranging both her marriages quickly yanks her down to reality by reminding her that she is little more then a pawn for people who want to cheat the system. The movie falls apart in the final third the twists and turns a bit ridiculous given the slow yet gripping pace of the previous sections. And yet the movie is still compelling quietly questioning a system in which people must go to such violent lengths in order to obtain simple and innocent desires. The lack of music gritty cinematography and superb acting all lend itself to the feelings of realism that pervade the film. The Dardenne brothers make us believe in Lorna's plight her struggle between what she feels morally is right and the silence that will enable her to live out her dream.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dardenne Brothers have a habit of immersing us in the muck of life then casually reminding us that in case we forgot we are surrounded by beauty. Their latest film Lorna's Silence is full of the trials of conflicted humanity with all too visible surface scars hiding its true nature. Set in the Belgian city of Liege Lorna an Albanian immigrant is eager to realize her dream of owning a snack shop together with her boyfriend Sokol Alban Ukaj a longdistance truck driver. In order to pursue this goal she has paid the sleazy mobconnected Fabio Fabrizio Rongione to arrange a marriage with a Belgian heroin addict Claudy Jrmie Renier in exchange for Belgian citizenship.After divorcing Claudy Lorna's plan is to marry again this time to a Russian mobster Anton Yakovlev so he can get his own papers. Luc Dardenne says that the idea for the film came from a social worker who told them about an incident in which her brother a junkie was offered a huge sum of money by the Albanian mafia to enter into a paper marriage with an Albanian prostitute. She would then divorce him for another wad of cash and be free to marry a member of the Albanian mafia both becoming Belgian citizens in the process.The early images are all about money. From the opening scene where bills are being counted money is constantly being handed over counted refused or buried in the ground. The cold expression on Lorna's face and her abruptness in conversation tells us almost immediately that the marriage is a fake. Lorna ignores Claudy's almost pathetic neediness while greed pervades the atmosphere. She fakes being physically abused by Claudy in order to secure evidence for a quickie divorce but Claudy is unwilling or unable to hurt her. In a scene marked by ghoulish humor she slams herself into a door and bangs her head against a wall to fill her body with bruises.Things become complicated however when Claudy vows to kick his drug habit and Lorna begins to care for him resisting Fabio's attempts to eliminate him via a drug overdose. Dobroshi delivers an outstanding performance as does Renier who has become one of the Dardennes' most confident regulars. Though the film is more plotdriven and the camerawork less oppressively intimate than some of the brothers' earlier films Lorna's Silence is nonetheless a gripping powerful drama full of searing insight into the human condition. What is most important is not the story or the movement of the camera but the continuity of the theme of the awakening of conscience.Just when we feel that the characters have no place to go but down the Dardennes tear us away suddenly from our addiction to the physical and hurl us into a world of tenderness and infinite possibility. As Lorna senses that she is suddenly at risk she seems to break through the cycle of futile actions that have marked her life and even in the mundane task of gathering wood to build a fire we sense the exhilaration of someone growing before our eyes. As the Dardennes invite us to step into a bigger world we hear the closing reverie of Beethoven's otherworldly Piano Sonata No. 32 reminding us that we are tuned into what the Quaker poet Thomas Kelly has called the silence which is the source of all sound.".

	schema:reviewBody "Le silence de Lorna Lorna's Silence is the latest film by the great Dardenne brothers. They are modernizing cinema of today philosophically as they are narratively. Compared to another film by the brothers Le fils 2002 Le silence de Lorna is not as experimental but at least as good if not better. It's their first portrait of an adult woman and they succeed incredibly well as always. The film deals with the European identity of today inhumanity in human trafficking and puts us in front of a social question how can humanity or any sort of morality remain in this cruel world we live in?Lorna Arta Dobroshi is in her thirties living in Belgium and dreaming of a better life. She lives in an arranged marriage with a junkie Claudy Jrmie Renier. The man who runs the arranged marriage business Fabio Fabrizio Rongione is planning to kill Claudy in hope of a better marriage deal. Fabio arranges men to marry Lorna for money so they can get a citizenship of Belgium. Le silence de Lorna deals with the subject of human trafficking business where the price of human life isn't high. It all happens in front of our eyes but we aren't doing a thing. In the end it grows out to be a strong moral study and the influence Krzysztof Kieslowski has had on the brothers is obvious.The Dardenne brothers are well known for their minimalism which can also be seen in Lorna's Silence. It doesn't have much music in it and the dialog is marginal  a lot from little is the core of minimalism. Luc Dardenne has said that he always listens to Beethoven before starting to work and in the end when the credits come on we get to listen Beethoven. The brothers have said that the more you take material away the closer you get to humane experiences. Their films are filled with body language gestures and close camerawork. The cinematography is unique and reinforces the position of a camera as an instrument for philosophy. They follow their characters closely and through that let us observe the situations they get into the situations in which they are prisoners of. The camera let's you to get into the minds of the characters. The camera sees what the character sees it doesn't know what happens outside of the character's world  so what has been cloaked from us?The leading themes of the story are humanity detachment guilt inhumanity and the European identity of today. The subject is very current in the age we live in. As I earlier mentioned Le silence de Lorna brings up a question how humanity can survive in the world of human trafficking. All the people in the business are portrayed as inhumane and careless. Where the victim of the business the junkie is portrayed as innocent. The eternal battle between good and evil is just one of the references to religion. Even that the brothers are atheists they had a strong catholic upbringing which can clearly be seen in their work. God is dead in their world view but they often use Christian allegories to reconstruct new humane experiences.In the end where Fabio hears that Lorna is pregnant and won't have an abortion he wants to get rid off her. We see Lorna getting away with her baby going into a detached house in the woods  the culmination of theme detachment. It is quite obvious that Lorna isn't really pregnant. The baby is just a symbol. It's a memory of the past of Cloudy and how it was Lorna's fault that he got killed. The baby is actually the guilt she's carrying.A marvelous film about the loss of humanity. I just saw it in theaters today and it went straight to my top ten of the decade. This film is very energetic the movement in it worked brilliantly and as the brothers have admitted movement is much more important than the plot in their films. Le silence de Lorna is a thoughtprovoking experience about the world we live in our concept of moral and the European identity.".

	schema:reviewBody "LORNA'S SILENCE is a film that very quietly grabs you by the throat and makes you pay attention to the stories of several emigrants that spin out of control. It is written and directed by JeanPierre and Luc Dardenne with an eye for verismo in the seamier side of the immigration problems.The story is set in Belgium where Lorna Arta Dobroshi works at a dry cleaners then goes home to her 'husband' Claudy Jrmie Renier a junkie who has been duped by Lorna and her little crime gang of cab driver Fabio Fabrizio Rongione and her boyfriend Sokol Alban Ukajinto marrying Lorna so that the Albanian girl can gain Belgian citizenship. Claudy seems a hopeless case in withdrawal for the umpteenth time but committed to getting off heroin. He pleads with his 'arranged wife' to help him with his attempt to get clean. Meanwhile Fabio has other plans Lorna is to 'marry' a wealthy Russian mobster to gain Belgian citizenship a second arranged marriage and in order for the second marriage to occur Lorna must consent to letting Claudy overdose on heroin and die making her a widow eligible for marriage. The other side story is that Lorna now a Belgian citizen can proceed with Sokol to set up a snack shop with Sokol using all the money she gains from the 'marriage game'.All is well until Claudy convinces Lorna to help him get to a hospital and get 'clean' and along the way Lorna's feelings for Claudy turn to compassion and passion. An incident occurs that throws all of the plans to the wind and Lorna is left with her secret and will hopefully manage to find a stable life without the crime influence.The acting is first rate and the moody atmosphere created is spellbinding. This is a little film that has a lot to say about the plight of immigrants.Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " An interesting new approach for the Dardennes.";
	schema:reviewBody "With JeanPierre and Luc Dardenne's fifth feature film Lorna's Silence they decided to take a surprisingly unique approach to their style in that they made it look more like a film than anything they had done before. Gone are the intimate gritty handheld tracking shots that place the audience into the perspective of the characters and shoot from odd seemingly improvised angles. Instead each shot here is much more staged and deliberate focused on Lorna Arta Dobroshi and making sure the audience is able to appreciate all of her surroundings in each moment. It was an interesting approach from the Dardennes and I have to admit a little jarring at first but this step into a more conventional shooting style provided the film with a contrast from their previous work that I certainly appreciated.As much as I adore their other work it was nice to see them trying something new and ultimately it worked. The more conventional style does a service for the more conventional narrative structure of the film as well as for the first time they work with a central plot that encompasses the entire picture rather than focusing on a more freeformed character study. Lorna is an Albanian emigrant living in Belgium in an arranged marriage to Claudy Jeremie Renier in order to acquire Belgian citizenship so that she can enter another arranged marriage with the Russian Andrei Anton Yakovlev after her and Claudy divorce. It's an elaborate scheme all run through Fabio Fabrizio Rongione a taxi driver looking to make some extra cash.The setup is unexpectedly complex for the Dardennes but what's not unexpected is how they approach the story primarily as a way to explore this character. They're not worried about whether the audience is keeping up with all of the semantics of the arranged marriages and divorces because they aren't too worried about it either instead they're focused on how all of this is impacting Lorna and that puts them right into their wheelhouse. In exploring this character they take their trademark understated approach letting the emotions sink in rather than explode outwardly. This provides for some fantastic internal acting by newcomer Arta Dobroshi who shines even more tremendously in the few moments where she is able to let those emotions come out. The role marks a genuine star is born performance from Dobroshi someone who we will hopefully be seeing much more of in the near future.The supporting cast all puts in great work but I have to give particular mention to Renier who shines once again in an unusual way. The Dardennes have used Renier in four of their six feature films and it's easy to see why. Without changing his physical appearance remotely he is somehow able to be a complete chameleon in each of his roles. The way he holds himself the way he moves the way he approaches any given situation each and every role he is a completely new person and it's extraordinary to watch because you don't see this guy acting at all. He is the true definition of an actor one who strips away any semblance of himself and disappears entirely into each and every new performance he gives. You look at his work in L'Infant this and the Dardennes next feature The Kid With A Bike and it's unbelievable the transformations he goes through.One of the many interesting things here was the physicality of the film how the muted emotions were able to manifest themselves in the physical moments such as Lorna slamming her head into a wall to prove that Claudy beats her or the raw and brazenly intimate sex scene. It's in these moments that the Dardennes' more authentic quieter approach demonstrates it's true ability making things that would seem ordinary in most films come as a shock and leave a lasting impact on the viewer.I won't give anything away but around the halfway point the film takes a turn that I wasn't expecting at all and completely through me for a loop. While the Dardennes had been traveling a more conventional path than usual in the final act they take Lorna's journey to a decidedly unique place. Their originality shines bright in this final act with scene after scene that had my jaw open simply over how innovative they had taken the story. I can't give anything away and ruin it for others but Lorna's Silence began in a more traditional route than I had come to expect from the Dardenne brothers and ended up going somewhere even less conventional than we had seen from them before. Yet another tremendous achievement from two of the best writerdirectors working today.".

It's obvious she won't get far having done what she did but I guess we're into her head which became rather cloudy near the end so she being left free is just that an illusion.I'd have liked Sokol's character a bit more of screen time. He seems in love then hurried back to work then grouchy near the end without any explanation of his jerky moods. Jrmie is a hell of a good actor. I didn't have much faith in him but it's not his thinness his tight jaw or stare into emptiness. He IS despair. Lorna...Arta Dobroshi had a make or break role here and she delivered a thrilling performance. Nuanced of a person probably without much mystery for our standards. But very real as any low class suburbs in an industrialized country. She seems perfectly cast for the role. Yes she's very beautiful but her face not being perfect her thinness being natural not fit like Hollywood actresses and without any aesthetic surgeries all make for her a probably too nice dry cleaner's but nevertheless believable in her constant strive for money where to hide it what to do with it etc. The way the Moreau family treats her even regarding  is perfect. If only they knew... I like that Lorna is far from perfect. She was fed up of Claudy even considering murder as just another option. Yes her sudden outburst of emotion gives some very timely drama to the plot  but I feel it was worth it. The naturalist script is what makes this film flow.Music is great. Beethoven's Sonata 34 op. 111 by Alfred Brendel sounded outlandish like it were part of another more abstract world. It is a shocking contrast to the world down below empty of any feelings. As such I think it's a brilliant emotional resource.".

Lorna has sympathy for this needy suffering young man and she'd like to adjust the pact with the devil to somehow spare him. However what she learns is that the devil doesn't like people who want to change the pact. Arta Dobroshi as Lorna is indeed from the Balkans. So it's not a stretch for French speakers to accept her authentic accent. Ms. Dobroshi is a superb actor and gives a brilliant performance as a woman who is basically decent but finds herself in a lessthandecent situation.Jrmie Renier is excellent as her husband Claudy. My wife and I admired his work before in another Dardenne brothers filmLa Promesse. It's really easy for Claudy to slip back into addiction and it's really hard to stay clean but he can do it if Lorna helps him.The Dardenne brothers specialize in films where bad things happen often to good people. The curator who introduced the film said that the Dardenes specialize in films that offer no hope but I don't fully agree. They specialize in hard films where tragedy is never far away but the films do hold out hope for redemption. This is not always enough but it's better than nothing.We saw the film on the large screen at the excellent Dryden Theatre in George Eastman House in Rochester. However it should work well on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dardenne brothers those impressive Belgian filmmakers are at it again. This is a sort of a departure for them although their keen insight about people of a certain status has been shown before perhaps with better results. As it's their style the film is devoid of music. Their camera has a way to offer the viewer an insight on the character he is seeing on the screen. Make no mistake Luc and JeanPierre Dardenne are at the top of their profession by presenting films that no one else would dare to show and above all they make the viewer get another take of life the way they see it.That said Le silence de Lorna takes us to meet people that are so completely different yet not because of that they don't feel real on the contrary. The situation at hand involves a young Albanian woman Lorna who has married Claudy a Belgian drug addict in order to get the citizenship papers. It is obvious their arrangement was purely a monetary one. Lorna who has an Albanian boyfriend Sokol hangs out with the wrong crowd in Liege. Her association with them will not end happily.Lorna's connection the reptile Fabio and his underling Spirou pressure Lorna into marrying a Russian mafia bigwig so that he can get the Belgian passport. Lorna like so many other immigrants wants to save her money to open a small snack bar with Sokol. She is sidetracked by what Fabio wants her to do. In fact Lorna is torn between trying to save Claudy who faces a possible death and get her dreams come true.The film owes a lot to Arta Dobroshi a dark haired beauty who is at the center of the story. Jeremie Renier who has done wonderful turns for the directorbrothers is seen as drug addict Claudy. Fabio Rongione appears as Fabio.We look forward to the brothers' next venture because their films always leaves the viewer richer knowing first hand about real people.".

Make no mistake Luc and JeanPierre Dardenne are at the top of their profession by presenting films that no one else would dare to show and above all they make the viewer get another take of life the way they see it.That said Le silence de Lorna takes us to meet people that are so completely different yet not because of that they don't feel real on the contrary. The situation at hand involves a young Albanian woman Lorna who has married Claudy a Belgian drug addict in order to get the citizenship papers. It is obvious their arrangement was purely a monetary one. Lorna who has an Albanian boyfriend Sokol hangs out with the wrong crowd in Liege. Her association with them will not end happily.Lorna's connection the reptile Fabio and his underling Spirou pressure Lorna into marrying a Russian mafia bigwig so that he can get the Belgian passport. Lorna like so many other immigrants wants to save her money to open a small snack bar with Sokol. She is sidetracked by what Fabio wants her to do. In fact Lorna is torn between trying to save Claudy who faces a possible death and get her dreams come true.The film owes a lot to Arta Dobroshi a dark haired beauty who is at the center of the story. Jeremie Renier who has done wonderful turns for the directorbrothers is seen as drug addict Claudy. Fabio Rongione appears as Fabio.We look forward to the brothers' next venture because their films always leaves the viewer richer knowing first hand about real people.";

Their partner is home smoking and listening to loud rock music. The partner apologises and tells the lead that they'll stop going out and doing what it is they're doing an exchange that we feel may have just played out for the umpteenth time. The home quarters are colourless and drab the walls undecorated and furniture sparse  perhaps they've just moved in perhaps they're really poor or maybe something more sinister is going on. We wonder what the ragged looking partner does that forces them to be as apologetic as they are the suggestion that they play a friendly game of cards together might itself suggest a gambling problem the manner in which the partner is shot that is to say from behind gets across a sense of anonymity or alienation about them on first sighting particularly in regards to how the character feels towards them. Very quickly the Dardenne brothers JeanPierre and Luc have caught us up in the world of these people through their realist style and wonderful techniques a sensation that does not abate until the very end.The lead is the titular Lorna Dobroshi a young woman an Albanian immigrant living illegally within the Belgian city of Leige and in a false loveless marriage to the aforementioned partner who's named Claudy Renier. Lorna's a simple enough girl with relatively attainable aspirations although living amidst a complicated scheme her tone quiet her dress sense normalised and in Kosovo born actress Arta Dobroshi an uncomplicated unspectacular unknown acting quantity whom carries a close to all but innocent expression on her face throughout as grins at the situation she's in and bears it. Lorna already has a partner away from Claudy whom is also Albanian a man named Sokol Ukaj and has her eye on a disused structure sitting idly on a plot of land that she one day hopes to turn into a snack barcomerestaurant with him so as to bring in the cash. Her confidant is a local gangster with broader connections to a Russian criminal organisation somebody we feel she'd have absolutely nothing to do with ordinarily  a cab driver named Fabio Rongione whom is able to access her the necessary items needed to live in Belgium out from under this shroud of seediness and falsity.The film is a wonderful involving mediation on the morality that comes with most of the actions reactions and scenarios of what Lorna is facing within the film. Living with a man as unappealing as she does using somebody else for her own gain and breaking international rules so as to be in a designated place are crimes she has either committed or is on the way to committing before the film has even begun. Complications that arise later on with the organisation of somebody's death stretch the band a tad too much for poor Lorna and it's then she realises the trouble her actions have put both her and those around her in. The Dardenne's balance this agonising central character study and the torn morals that come with it with the backburning gangsters whom oppose Lorna's anti cutthroat ideas of divorce because they incur police involvement. The result is a beautifully crafted and solid piece of drama that's gripping from its humble beginnings right through to its terrifying finale.By day Lorna works in a laundromat steaming sheets and pressing clothes and so forth. The job entails pressing out and washing out both the grime and creases from numerous sheets which come in something that echos what she has going on in her private life as her very soul begins to collect the grime and the creases that come with operating within the world she's operating and dealing with the people she's dealing. The grime threatens to reach a breaking point so much so that a ploy to organise a case of fauxdomestic abuse involving Claudy may just be enough to at least save his life as the Russians plan to simply have him overdose a death which is clearly a step too far from Lorna's perspective and something far too weighty for her conscience to take.The film is a quietly murky piece and it's this event which does so well in capturing this overlying canopy. Lorna and Claudy being forced by way of the state of desperation they're in to forge a domestic abuse scenario in which one is the victim and one the aggressor. The agonising planning of this event the excruciating practising of it that must be completed prior to the execution proper and then the fallout which unfolds as a result of it are individual instances that manifest because of what these desperate characters have got themselves involved in. This being a film about process about processes and the tortuous carrying out of a number of procedures so as to hopefully spawn a fresher more hopeful dawn is captured wonderfully by the two sibling directors. There's a coldness to proceedings a detached sense of everybody within the film not liking one another at all although never daring to actually admit it with the long takes that're applied handled expertly the emotions of pain frustration anger and weakness which begins to manifest within numerous characters gradually rearing themselves on the faces within. The film is a brilliant character study an unnerving thriller and a quite brilliant piece.".

The character development is well thought out and her reactions to situations is believable and interesting. Arta Dobrowshi is magnetic on the screen. The underworld of drugs crime and fraud wears her down and we witness her decline sympathetically. spoiler Towards the end of the movie the dread and feeling of entrapment is tangible and clear. The only drawback for me was the resolution of the story sort of cutoff. Still Recommended.".

For a small child it's just a delightfull fairy tale with all necessary ingredients. A couple years older one appreciates the wonderful pictures of castles animals hunting scenes. Then I started understanding its special humour. Later of course I fell in love with the gorgeous youthful tomboyish main actress and couldn't see enough of her riding in moon light through a snowy landscape. Then I started noticing how innovative the style of the movie was in its time how well done the cutting how fitting the soundtrack. I also saw how well it portrays women as equal partners that are not defined by beauty alone. After all the prince has to acknowledge all of Cindarella's roles worker huntress and ball princess before she agrees on marrying him. Of course it has its little imperfections. Some of the actors can't quite reach the standard set by others. Some tricks like the flight of Rosalie the owl don't look right. Sometimes the pics are just a little too kitsch. But it just doesn't matter. It's my favorite fairy tale movie and it always will be. It's a lifelong love story hopefully to be passed on to other generations.".

I am an American and I must agree whole heartedly!  Because cable tv was not widespread when I first saw this film and VCR's and DVD's were nonexistent I remember keeping my eye out for this movie in hopes of watching it again.  The one time I saw it it was featured on a Saturday morning children's special and I have not seen it since.

Later the movie became a regular Christmas staple on German television so I could see it all over and over. Growing up i admit to have fallen in love with the actress of Cinderella as every boy who watched this movie would admit to also. I never found any big flaw in this movie. Maybe the special effects are not up to date to modern 50 million dollar productions but you have to consider that it was created in 1973 and in Czechoslovakia to boot. The acting is great in every aspect maybe a bit overdone sometimes but better then in many American blockbusters. The conversion of the fairytale is not based totally on the Grimm's tale Cinderella but more on the regional bohemian version. To that it clings very good. And what I really love are the buildings and landscapes....they are really authentic something I miss in fairy tale movies shot in America but they clearly don't have the agesold castles and mansions.I give this movie a 10 out of 10 which I don't do lightly. Every time I watch this masterpiece it brings back my youth more than any other movie.".

It is an absolute bliss and obviously a timeless classic. I just bought in online in USA for my fouryearold daughter who loved it just as I did as a kid. Regrettably Czech fairytalemovies are neither wellknown in USA nor does this country produce any comparable children's entertainment of such dreamy yet accessible and sensitive quality. The story is based on the Grimm's version of Cinderella different from Disney's who worked from the Perrault version. However this Cinderella has a lot more support from a number of animal friends not just the original doves and she can speak to all of them. Her special friend is a beautiful white horse. She also has an adorable tomboyish side to her which she easily combines with the ability to turn into a graceful princess. As a special eyecandy the story is set in a rural winterlandscape which creates an incredible charm. Equally outstanding is the soundtrack. This movie is a mustsee for any age group if you have chance to watch it when its snowy outside you will absolutely fall in love with it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why did it take me so long to see Three Wishes for Cinderella? The only excuse had is that until people starting recommending it on the recent Cinderella film boards Three Wishes for Cinderella was completely unknown to me. After hearing from these people that it was the best version of the Cinderella story always has been my personal favourite fairy tale this reviewer knew she had to check it out. And it really has to be one of the best decisions and things done in some time. As much as I don't have anything against other versions of Cinderella like some of the commentators do most of them are actually very enjoyable to great to me I do have to fully concur after tracking the full film down on Youtube that Three Wishes for Cinderella is the best version of the story. Adaptationwise while not completely faithful to all the details the basic details are there if more Grimm than Perrault with the inclusion of doves to help with the impossible tasks but also the magical spirit of the story still remains and the freshness that is brought to the storytelling also was much appreciated.Three Wishes for Cinderella is a wonderfullooking film. It's beautifully shot and fluidly edited quite innovative for the time I'm told the winter scenery and decor are nothing short of exquisite and the costumes are equally attractive. The music score is whimsical fits absolutely perfectly and was clearly scored with a lot of love and care the main theme does repeat itself but is incredibly catchy and radiates with charm almost like being part of a dream. Three Wishes for Cinderella smartly and poignantly scripted with some nice refreshing humour. Where it is easy to identify completely with Popelka and her problems and the characters are more developed than just being archetypes. Storytelling was really welltold and compelling sometimes paced deliberately but never to the extent of being too slow or laborious. Also loved how Popelka and the Prince's romance and the character of the Prince was more developed consequently wittier and more affecting than most versions with the exception of Ever After and the recent Cinderella though it does it a little better than those two. As mentioned the characters are interesting and nicely written and developed as aforementioned being more than stock archetypesstereotypes like characters can be in adaptations in fairy tales not a knock as there is still a lot of love for them by me but it is true. The tricks and effects are mostly fine though those of Rosalie the owl agreed are a tad rushedlooking but that is such a minor complaint and didn't jar too much.Acting is very good. Libuse Safrnkov is exceptional as Popelka. She is beautiful and shows great personality she's smart sometimes funny spunky kind effortlessly cute and incredibly charming and poignant. Love also her almost deadly aim how many versions of Cinderella have that? how she rides her horse and dances almost like on a cloud. The Prince of Pavel Trvncek matches her perfectly in charm is never dull or annoying for a character in the story who is barely developed and the character is surprisingly interesting. Their chemistry together is thoroughly convincing. Carola Braunbock relishes her role as the cruel mother while avoiding overdoing it a difficult task for a character so juicy in most adaptations of Cinderella. Likewise with Dana Hlavcov's Dora the sister and the King and Queen are touchingly and sincerely played.Overall pure fairy tale magic and adaptations of Cinderella don't get much better than this. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	onyx:emotionText "Why did it take me so long to see Three Wishes for Cinderella? The only excuse had is that until people starting recommending it on the recent Cinderella film boards Three Wishes for Cinderella was completely unknown to me. After hearing from these people that it was the best version of the Cinderella story always has been my personal favourite fairy tale this reviewer knew she had to check it out. And it really has to be one of the best decisions and things done in some time. As much as I don't have anything against other versions of Cinderella like some of the commentators do most of them are actually very enjoyable to great to me I do have to fully concur after tracking the full film down on Youtube that Three Wishes for Cinderella is the best version of the story. Adaptationwise while not completely faithful to all the details the basic details are there if more Grimm than Perrault with the inclusion of doves to help with the impossible tasks but also the magical spirit of the story still remains and the freshness that is brought to the storytelling also was much appreciated.Three Wishes for Cinderella is a wonderfullooking film. It's beautifully shot and fluidly edited quite innovative for the time I'm told the winter scenery and decor are nothing short of exquisite and the costumes are equally attractive. The music score is whimsical fits absolutely perfectly and was clearly scored with a lot of love and care the main theme does repeat itself but is incredibly catchy and radiates with charm almost like being part of a dream. Three Wishes for Cinderella smartly and poignantly scripted with some nice refreshing humour. Where it is easy to identify completely with Popelka and her problems and the characters are more developed than just being archetypes. Storytelling was really welltold and compelling sometimes paced deliberately but never to the extent of being too slow or laborious. Also loved how Popelka and the Prince's romance and the character of the Prince was more developed consequently wittier and more affecting than most versions with the exception of Ever After and the recent Cinderella though it does it a little better than those two.

It's just something I've seen every year since I was a kid. And the fact that every person is dubbed by the same man in Norwegian doesn't matter at all. It's just part of the charm. The movie tells about the courage and strong will to a young girl and who knows maybe it's important for little girls to watch it they won't turn out like those Britney SpearsParis Hilton Barbie dolls they'll have more guts than that! I personally don't know a single person who doesn't like that movie so I'll recommend it for everyone now. It's AMAZING!!!!".

He lived in East Germany where life in the eighties felt like the sixties had never ended short skirts long hair everybody listened to forbidden music and watched consumer instructions and Hollywood serials coming from the dark territory behind the Western border. In this magic time when bread was so cheap you could easily build a house with it in a land where cars where made out of plastic and pulp and people out of silence for a young human being TV was the only connection to the real world to the real people living elsewhere. When he was young this boy watched everything he could he loved the tube with all of his heart. But when he saw for the first time the fairytale of Cinderella he was lost. He had fallen for Cinderella head over heels he had never seen something so beautiful and honest in all of his life. Until the age of fourteen he had seen the film at least 20 times which was very often because there were no videotapes or VCRs in East Germany. He had a crush on Libuse Safrankova and he was never to be cured. No woman in the whole world could come close to her. Nothing could come close to her including him. For all of his life he was unable to fall in love or have a relationship. There simply was no one who could compete with her in his heart. And then one day he saw a picture of her. Libuse laying in bed together with a man in a movie the title I can't remember. Let's say as much as this I think you know what happened  his mother found him  and I have no intention to talk about the details. As for Three Nuts for Cinderella I have no idea how something so beautiful could have been made in East Germany. I just don't get it. Of course there were other good fairytale movies but nothing anywhere comparable with this. If I have to rank this I'd rather give it a 0. Keep your hands off this film watch Star Wars or Walt Disney you will be happier in the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "and one of De Funes' funniest ever. The fourth movie in the Gendarme series this story finds the boys in forced retirement from the cushy police job at St. Tropez because they've become too old. When the Adjutant Galabru comes to visit De Funes to reminisce about old times they discover that one of their old group Fougasse has had a head injury has amnesia and is in an institution. They decide to get the old gang back and save him. But to save him they decide to kidnap him and don their old Gendarme uniforms so they can bring back his memory of who he is. That's where the fun starts because soon they are pursued by real Gendarmes for impersonating false Gendarmes. It's silly fun but very funny thanks to brilliant performances by De Funes and Galabru.Throughout the film there are too many funny moments with De Funes to mention. In the early scenes I died laughing when De Funes now a rich man for having married into wealth punches out his maid repeatedly in the face. De Funes' outlandish comedic rages have often been compared to the manic temper of Donald Duck. In another scene De Funes is at his absolute best when mumbling incredible gibberish when he and his false Gendarmes get stoned on marijuana in a hippie commune where they are forced to hide from the real Gendarmes pursuing them. But one of the very best scenes of De Funes in any movie is when the false Gendarmes arrive upon a traffic accident and can't help themselves they must don their old uniforms and become cops again if only for a few moments. In this scene De Funes uses a police whistle to clear the accident from the road and from the sounds he makes you can actually understand what words in cop language his cadence implies. It's unforgettable. The man was a genius and there will never be another.".

Many can say that Gendarmes is commercial series and it's not showing the true talent of Louis de Funes I will not agree with it. Maybe Gendarmes in New York and Gendarmes and Gendarmettes is not a great movies but they have their good parts too. Of course it's not the same to the Funes's greatest hit Oscar but it costs it's price! It's truly the best part of the Gendarmes Series! De Funes and others doing their best there. Many can say that Gendarmes from SentTropes is much better but it's not. Because there is many great jokes but not much of an action. So I think that's it's the golden middle of the series. This movie is a wonderful piece of constant action and great jokes. Jokes there aren't the same as in modern pictures maybe sometimes they aren't funny at all but if you look at the people who jokesgendarmes  you'll see what I mean. So for me it was a good movie in my childhood and now...it became classic!".

Of course it's not the same to the Funes's greatest hit Oscar but it costs it's price! It's truly the best part of the Gendarmes Series! De Funes and others doing their best there. Many can say that Gendarmes from SentTropes is much better but it's not. Because there is many great jokes but not much of an action. So I think that's it's the golden middle of the series. This movie is a wonderful piece of constant action and great jokes. Jokes there aren't the same as in modern pictures maybe sometimes they aren't funny at all but if you look at the people who jokesgendarmes  you'll see what I mean. So for me it was a good movie in my childhood and now...it became classic!";

	schema:reviewBody "Well the seventies marked quite a weird start for Louis de Funs with The Troop on Vacation and The Orchestra Man but I could stand the musical and its avalanche of kitschy and psychedelic effects I even gave it a good review. I'm not sure where I stand exactly with the fourth of the Troops series. I know what I hate and I didn't dislike it to say that I loved it would be an overstatement though.Obviously Jean Girault's film doesn't take itself seriously even as a comedy so any attempt to rationalize it would be sillier than the silliest gags and God knows there were. But there's one thing the film takes seriously and it's the deep bond it created between the six members of the troop the popularity of these guys and apparently that was more sufficient than any possible plot. I give it the credit for at least trying to do without a plot and sometimes succeeding. After all what kind of plot could they come up with? In fact there was such a feeling of completeness when the previous film ended when Ludovic Cruchot Louis de Funs got married with the aristocratic Josepha Claude Gensac that I don't think any writer could have come up with something that would justify another sequel. Children? Marital life? Another nudist camp situation? Drugs? They wouldn't exist in that planet. But it's true since the first opus we never really saw the troop together it has always centered on De Funs Galabru and the rest of the time in a ratio that I would evaluate at 70 25 and 5. Now it's not perfectly balanced but it's a good 40 35 and 25 and what was the best way to bring our popular gendarmes together? Simply to set them apart at the start.At the beginning Cruchot is seen in a rather unusual situation asleep on his desk he's immediately awakened by the superior officer who informs the whole troop that they're being discharged in other words they're asked to leave and their replacements are so impressively emotionless they tower over the taller gendarmes. Our lousy six leave the office in civilian clothes followed by their wives. And six months later we meet Cruchot trying to fit within his new aristocratic costume. I was reminded of Captain Haddock lamentably trying to stay on horse or keep a monocle when he inherited the Moulinsart castle. The sequence is an excuse for a series of great gags some of the best visual gags from a De Funs film but you can tell they're running out of ideas once it involves a red paint over a car and Gensac screaming all over the place. Thankfully Gerber Galabru pays a visit to Cruchot announcing him that poor Fougasse is amnesic so they decide to take one last trip to cure him. You know there's something really lacking in the inspiration closet when you have to rely on amnesia but even that last gasp of inspiration behind Jacques Wilfrid's typewriter provided many great moments some that even worked on a selfreferential effect so weird that I hesitated many times between calling the film 'lousy' or 'genius'. There is some genius in the way the film sacrifices any bit of credibility for the sake of laughs fun and nostalgia with Cruchot showing archive footage from the previous film to Gerber or when he asks Fougasse if he remembers him by mimicking the grimaces that made him famous.Indeed you can't tell where De Funs started and Cruchot ended. The approach culminates with the gendarmes playfully singing the theme of the movie in the car or walking or bouncing all over the way there are more shots of the six men together in that film than the first three combined. As for the iconic march Funs insisted to have the theme played many times but the whole selfawareness of the film provided a surreal dimension especially when they were trying to avoid the real gendarmes. They even meet the driving nurse and she asks them how come they always meet in every film this is not even a figure of speech film means film. The wink De Funs gave him at the end proves that it's all of a big joke and that's how we should embrace it. That the fight involves a crazy missile and children should dissipate any remaining doubt.The film loses its way more than once making the hippie sheep and nun part longer than needed but overall it is is perhaps the last hurrah of the Troop series with the six original members one last time before they would take Louis de Funs again to a sorry ride into the Scifi genre nine years later. But the film proves one thing that if there's a director who contributed to De Funs' legacy it's Grard Oury the next movie the actor would play were The Orchestra Man Delusions of Grandeurs and The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob and they allowed his talent to be expressed in different situations the Gendarme film is good entertainment but there was more De Funs had to prove to consolidate his legend.".

The 'Who Will Buy' sequence is one of the best ever. One to watch and cherish and remember just how good musical films used to be.";

Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can't imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis' Nancy if the best character for me. She put up with so much for those boys I think she's such a strong character and her final scene when... Well you know... Always makes me cry! Best musical in my opinion of all time.

	schema:reviewBody "Its strange that the film that won the best picture Oscar at the 1968 Academy Awards was a film made in England but if ever a movie deserved that honor I think it is Oliver. This movie is a true classic that should be on every best picture list and given a place of honor at The American Film Institute. Movie musicals died out a long time ago and it is a shame because this is the best movie musical I have ever seen. Usually movie musicals are slipshod with some great numbers mixed in with some poor ones. Oliver does the impossible because every number and every dance in this film hits the bullseye! From Food Glorious Food to Consider Yourself to Who Will Buy This Wonderful Morning. Ron Moody Shani Wallace as Nancy and Mark Lester as Oliver all give outstanding performances. Mark Lester was at one time the most famous child actor in the entire world. He was the Ricky Schroder of his day or the MacAuley Culkin of his day I'll bet he wishes he could have made the kind of money they did!. Mark Lester is now a doctor in England and I wrote him a couple emails and he talked about Oliver and what a fine experience it was making the film. Shani Wallace was a fine English actress who never got the credit she deserved. She was so good as the sweet loving Nancy who took a shine to little Oliver and gave her life saving him her murder scene still makes me shiver even Charles Dickens said that bothered him when he wrote it!. Doctor Lester wrote me that Shani Wallace was like a big sister to him and it shows on the screen. Ron Moody is delightfully hammy as Fagin. He sort of reminds me of Charles Laughton the way he carries the part to its ludicrous extreme but you savor it along with him. Charles Dickens was so good at portraying the poverty and horrible living conditions of his time and this film shows that especially in the workhouse. Children really lived under those conditions and it is horrifying. The scene that got me is where they are being served horrible gruel and are walking by the dining room where Mister Bumble and his henchmen are dining like kings! That really made me angry. Anyhow Oliver is a wonderful film that would stand up to any film today and is a good viewing experience for the whole family. It will leave you with a happy heart and a lump in your throat and what more could you ask for?".

In a way he was a literary caricaturist and cartoonist. He could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence. He pricked pride lampooned arrogance celebrated modesty and empathised with loneliness and poverty. It may be a clich but he was a people's writer.And it is the comedy that is so often missing from his interpretations. At the time of writing Oliver Twist is being dramatised in serial form on BBC television. All of the misery and cruelty is their but non of the humour irony and savage lampoonery. The result is just a dark dismal experience the story penned by a journalist rather than a novelist. It's not really Dickens at all.'Oliver!' on the other hand is much closer to the mark. The mockery of officialdom is perfectly interpreted from the blustering beadle to the drunken magistrate. The classic standoff between the beadle and Mr Brownlow in which the law is described as 'a ass a idiot' couldn't have been better done. Harry Secombe is an ideal choice.But the blinding cruelty is also there the callous indifference of the state the cold hunger poverty and loneliness are all presented just as surely as The Master would have wished.And then there is crime. Ron Moody is a treasure as the sleazy Jewish fence whilst Oliver Reid has Bill Sykes to perfection.Perhaps not surprisingly Lionel Bart  himself a Jew from London's eastend  takes a liberty with Fagin by reinterpreting him as a much more benign fellow than was Dicken's original. In the novel he was utterly ruthless sending some of his own boys to the gallows in order to protect himself though he was also caught and hanged. Whereas in the movie he is presented as something of a wayward fatherfigure a sort of charitable thief rather than a corrupter of children the latter being a longstanding antisemitic sentiment. Otherwise very few liberties are taken with Dickens's original. All of the most memorable elements are included. Just enough menace and violence is retained to ensure narrative fidelity whilst at the same time allowing for children' sensibilities. Nancy is still beaten to death Bullseye narrowly escapes drowning and Bill Sykes gets a faithfully graphic comeuppance.Every song is excellent though they do incline towards schmaltz. Mark Lester mimes his wonderfully. Both his and my favourite scene is the one in which the world comes alive to 'who will buy'. It's schmaltzy but it's Dickens through and through.I could go on. I could commend the wonderful setpieces the contrast of the rich and poor. There is topquality acting from more British regulars than you could shake a stick at.I ought to give it 10 points but I'm feeling more like Scrooge today. Soak it up with your Christmas dinner. No original has been better realised.".

The combination of a superb cast wonderful music and breathtaking choreography mean that the film loses nothing in its translation from the stage.  To this day it remains one of the standout musical adaptions in a dwindling field.Although the conservative Dickens fanatics may thumb their noses at various liberties taken on the original plot of Oliver Twist they should observe that Oliver! has recreated most of the spirit intended by Dickens.  While primarily a musical comedy Oliver! certainly has a dark undercurrent thanks to the skillful direction of Carol Reed and the sinister acting of Oliver Reed playing Bill Sikes.  Dickens was essentially a talented satirist who constructed his characters to convey a moralistic view on Victorian society.  Oliver! conveys much of the sadness and desperation of the original novel.For anyone not acquainted with the famous storyline the film treats of a young orphan Oliver Twist and follows his journey from a paupers' workhouse to the roughandtumble city life of London.  He is spotted and introduced into a gang of thieves led by the crafty and cunning Fagin. What follows for Oliver is an introduction to the art of picking pockets the methods of justice dispened by Mr Fang the magistrate the cruelty of Bill Sikes the notorious thief and the compassion of Nancy Bill's mate the kindness of Mr and Mrs Brownlow.  Such an adventure for such a small boy!It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason why this Oscarwinning film is such a success.  On one hand there is the incredible performances of a gifted cast  Ron Moody being nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Fagin and young Jack Wild's mature performance as the Artful Dodger.  Mark Lester plays Oliver and depicts all the elements of innocence and vulnerability as could be imagined in the young boy.  Harry Secombe backs up the cast as the beadle Mr Bumble.Perhaps the best aspect of the film though is the music itself.  Lionel Bart has done a masterful job in writing the original score and you may expect to find yourself singing the songs for weeks after watching Oliver!.  Here are the evergreens Reviewing the Situation You've Got to Pick a Pocket Or Two Who Will Buy and the beautiful and touching Where is Love?. The list of classic tunes goes on and on and if nothing else young people today should watch the film purely for its educational value  to be introduced to the sweet music of yesteryear and to see that a film's qualities extend beyond the realms of special effects.Oliver! will rightfully go down as a classic film of its time and with any luck will keep its place as a family favourite for years to come.

	schema:headline " First the novel then the straight dramatic film then the musical  and the best picture Oscar";
	schema:reviewBody "OLIVER TWIST was to have controversy as well as success following it after Dickens published it in 1837. His picture of life in the urban ghettos was something shocking and new and his making the central figures of the novel include criminals was another innovation.One day he was walking in London and passed a young woman he had been friendly with. He said hello but she was rather stiff with him. He could not understand this. A few days later they met again and he asked what he had done to upset her. Well if you must know I did not like your last novel. she said. Really everyone else thinks highly of it. He was puzzled What's wrong with it? Oh Charles she said I'm Jewish. How could you make up such a character like Fagin?! He had not expected this Well...you know that trial last year of Ikey Solomon the thief trainer. He's a model for Fagin and he was Jewish. Dickens found that did not settle things. Yes she replied He got what he deserved. But Charles they did not call him Solomon the Jew like you call Fagin the Jew! Moreover Solomon did not plan a murder. Fagin does. Dickens had to admit that he might have gotten carried away. He left thinking about what she said.Oliver Twist was published in several editions. Dickens tried to improve on Fagin a bit. Then he got an idea. He reworked the chapter called Fagin's Last Night Alive showing the fears in the man as he faced hanging. He also added some additional details. He let his female friend know about his resolve to change Fagin. A day or so later he met her at a friend's house. She looked at him as though he was crazy. Didn't you like the changes? he asked. Charles what changes  he's still a vile villain called the Jew! she replied. Yes I did keep those in but didn't you see how frightened he was in the death cell in prison. The young woman had noticed this but felt that he was so vile he deserved to be suffering such fears. Ah...then I was right about that...and did you see the little details I added? he asked. What details? she replied. When you first see Fagin now he is cooking himself dinner...you read that? Dickens looked at her expecting a sign of recognition. Instead the lady looked confused. I read he was at the fireplace but I must have skimmed the passage. Dickens smiled as though he was brilliant He is cooking a pork sausage for his dinner. A what!she exclaimed. He's eating pork my dear...see  he's not a good Jew! His friend looked at him shook her head and to his dismay left their friend's house. She didn't speak to him for years.Dickens never totally shook off his own bigotries but the situation did lead to a partial attempt at amends in his last completed novel. In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND 1865 he has a minor character Mr. Riah who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to collect high rents from poor tenants. The landlord figures that Mr. Riah will be blamed because he is Jewish.But Mr. Riah is a good man. He is a very good man. He is a very very very very good man  so good as to be unbelievable. If Fagin saw Mr. Riah in action he'd probably chase him away with a stick.The antiSemitic image of Fagin lingers to this day. It is a measure of Dickens' genius as a writer that the novel overcomes it. However in presenting the story on film it still causes problems for screenplay writers and directors how after the Holocaust can one do a film treatment of a worthy novel without inflaming bigotry? David Lean showed how by having Alec Guiness appear in one or two scenes showing a human side and in confronting a mob at the end with true dignity. Sir Carol Reed in his musical version of the novel did it better yet due to a rewrite in the original musical's script.OLIVER had been made into a West End musical hit in the middle 1960s and then taken to Broadway where it was again a hit. With a wonderful score by Lionel Bart including Food Glorious Food I Am Reviewing the Situation Consider Yourself Boy For Sale Who Will Buy As Long As He Needs Me it deserved it's success. Reed did well in his casting the roles including his nephew Oliver Reed as Sykes Ron Moody as Fagin Mark Lester as Oliver Jack Wild as the Dodger Shani Wallis as Nancy and Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble. There had been no big musical successes in Hollywood for a decade  the last musical to win the Best Picture Oscar had been GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968.And Fagin  how to handle the eternal problem of the caricature? Well in the musical Fagin is not captured tried and executed for the murder that is committed. After all even Lean showed Fagin tried to control his confederate in his actions. But here Fagin realizes that he is getting too old to depend on this kind of chancy life. Although he loses his treasures those stolen items he kept because he knew their value and admired their beauty he decides he can reform. He is allowed to do so accompanied by his faithful acolyte the Artful Dodger. I don't think Dickens would have appreciated the change his female friend might have but a modern audience certainly accepts it as fitting.".

Didn't you like the changes? he asked. Charles what changes  he's still a vile villain called the Jew! she replied. Yes I did keep those in but didn't you see how frightened he was in the death cell in prison. The young woman had noticed this but felt that he was so vile he deserved to be suffering such fears. Ah...then I was right about that...and did you see the little details I added? he asked. What details? she replied. When you first see Fagin now he is cooking himself dinner...you read that? Dickens looked at her expecting a sign of recognition. Instead the lady looked confused. I read he was at the fireplace but I must have skimmed the passage. Dickens smiled as though he was brilliant He is cooking a pork sausage for his dinner. A what!she exclaimed. He's eating pork my dear...see  he's not a good Jew! His friend looked at him shook her head and to his dismay left their friend's house. She didn't speak to him for years.Dickens never totally shook off his own bigotries but the situation did lead to a partial attempt at amends in his last completed novel. In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND 1865 he has a minor character Mr. Riah who is used by an unscrupulous landlord to collect high rents from poor tenants. The landlord figures that Mr. Riah will be blamed because he is Jewish.But Mr. Riah is a good man. He is a very good man. He is a very very very very good man  so good as to be unbelievable. If Fagin saw Mr. Riah in action he'd probably chase him away with a stick.The antiSemitic image of Fagin lingers to this day. It is a measure of Dickens' genius as a writer that the novel overcomes it. However in presenting the story on film it still causes problems for screenplay writers and directors how after the Holocaust can one do a film treatment of a worthy novel without inflaming bigotry? David Lean showed how by having Alec Guiness appear in one or two scenes showing a human side and in confronting a mob at the end with true dignity. Sir Carol Reed in his musical version of the novel did it better yet due to a rewrite in the original musical's script.OLIVER had been made into a West End musical hit in the middle 1960s and then taken to Broadway where it was again a hit. With a wonderful score by Lionel Bart including Food Glorious Food I Am Reviewing the Situation Consider Yourself Boy For Sale Who Will Buy As Long As He Needs Me it deserved it's success. Reed did well in his casting the roles including his nephew Oliver Reed as Sykes Ron Moody as Fagin Mark Lester as Oliver Jack Wild as the Dodger Shani Wallis as Nancy and Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble. There had been no big musical successes in Hollywood for a decade  the last musical to win the Best Picture Oscar had been GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968.And Fagin  how to handle the eternal problem of the caricature? Well in the musical Fagin is not captured tried and executed for the murder that is committed. After all even Lean showed Fagin tried to control his confederate in his actions. But here Fagin realizes that he is getting too old to depend on this kind of chancy life. Although he loses his treasures those stolen items he kept because he knew their value and admired their beauty he decides he can reform. He is allowed to do so accompanied by his faithful acolyte the Artful Dodger. I don't think Dickens would have appreciated the change his female friend might have but a modern audience certainly accepts it as fitting.";

Ron Moody IS Fagin just as Jack Wilde makes an ideal Artful Dodger and seriously is it possible to imagine a more darker more brooding more downright nasty evil Bill Sykes than Oliver Reed?

To this wonderful cast of leads add some fantastic performances by the likes of Harry Secombe Peggy Mount Leonard Rossiter Hylda Baker Kenneth Cranham and I loved Hugh Griffith's cameo as the Magistrate! Lionel Bart's masterpiece score hits every right note! Every song is memorable from the big production numbers to the heartfelt ballads. Hard to pick a favourite but I love Consider Yourself. At no point does the 2 hours 30 minutes lag or become boring. If you have seen the film I hope you agree with me even partially if you have NOT seen the film I thoroughly recommend it sit down with the whole family and allow yourself to be entertained from start to finish. I saw the film in 1968 when it was first released I purchased the VHS tape as soon as it became available and wore several of them out! and now have the DVD. I have lost count of the times I have watched the film but genuinely it must be into the dozens! ALL my kids love the film. and regularly watch it as well. Oliver! is the MVP of musicals a rollicking adventure through early 19th century London.

	schema:reviewBody "I love this movie. Love it love it love it.But I know that not everyone loves musicals. So if you find the musical genre contrived or unnatural or kitschy if it's just not your thing then don't bother with this movie because it is unabashedly and outstandingly a MUSICAL.The songs Food Glorious Food Consider Yourself You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two just for starters. These are wonderfully singable indelibly memorable and they move the plot and action along the way musical numbers in a film should. This is a lost art now I'm convinced although maybe with the TV series Glee! now riding a wave of popularity there will be some talented musicians and lyricists who will revive this artform. Anyway suffice it to say Oliver! is the musical at its best.The actors Oh my lord. Here we have Ron Moody in the role of Fagin and he is INDELIBLE. He doesn't just act the role he doesn't just sing it and dance it he slips into the character's skin and he IS Fagin in a way that makes it impossible to imagine anyone else in this role.Jack Wild as the Artful Dodger. He's just superb audacious and sassy and swaggering and you can't help but like him even as you see him cheerfully taking up a life of crime. He makes us accept the character as someone basically goodhearted who is just adapting to the life he has to live. Matteroffactly and without malice and leaping to grab joy when the opportunity presents itself.Shani Wallis as Nancy tender and tough tough and tender she has the virtues of loyalty and honesty even as those values become hindrances to survival. She is who she is and she doesn't apologize for it she's key to saving young Oliver.Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. I love Oliver Reed always have and he dominates every scene he has in this movie. You look at him and you see what the Artful Dodger would turn into if he had malice in his soul. Sikes is dangerous he has no code but survival for himself and he'll throw anyone else to the wolves without pausing to think about it if it serves him to do so. Oliver Reed really makes the movie work because he brings genuine menance and sexuality to his role which serves as a counterpoint for the sweetness of the musical as a whole.And finally Mark Lester. He is beyond winsome as the title character a completely believable innocent who is without guile and imbued with a natural sense of goodness. I just love looking at Mark Lester he's such a beautiful and dreamylooking child.This movie is about as good as a musical gets it's visually stunning in the sets and the cinematography and the costumes and in the staging of the musical numbers. The characters are wonderful they're classics.

Since the first time I saw it I've seen it more than a dozen times more and it's a movie I can watch again and again and again.As a musical it's tops. But not everyone likes musicals. Maybe because not every musical is as good as Oliver! on every level.Maybe just maybe we'll see a renaissance of the genre soon and more people who don't like musicals because they've only seen bad ones will understand that when a musical is good it's really really good.".

	onyx:emotionText "I love this movie. Love it love it love it.But I know that not everyone loves musicals. So if you find the musical genre contrived or unnatural or kitschy if it's just not your thing then don't bother with this movie because it is unabashedly and outstandingly a MUSICAL.The songs Food Glorious Food Consider Yourself You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two just for starters. These are wonderfully singable indelibly memorable and they move the plot and action along the way musical numbers in a film should. This is a lost art now I'm convinced although maybe with the TV series Glee! now riding a wave of popularity there will be some talented musicians and lyricists who will revive this artform. Anyway suffice it to say Oliver! is the musical at its best.The actors Oh my lord. Here we have Ron Moody in the role of Fagin and he is INDELIBLE. He doesn't just act the role he doesn't just sing it and dance it he slips into the character's skin and he IS Fagin in a way that makes it impossible to imagine anyone else in this role.Jack Wild as the Artful Dodger. He's just superb audacious and sassy and swaggering and you can't help but like him even as you see him cheerfully taking up a life of crime. He makes us accept the character as someone basically goodhearted who is just adapting to the life he has to live. Matteroffactly and without malice and leaping to grab joy when the opportunity presents itself.Shani Wallis as Nancy tender and tough tough and tender she has the virtues of loyalty and honesty even as those values become hindrances to survival. She is who she is and she doesn't apologize for it she's key to saving young Oliver.Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. I love Oliver Reed always have and he dominates every scene he has in this movie. You look at him and you see what the Artful Dodger would turn into if he had malice in his soul. Sikes is dangerous he has no code but survival for himself and he'll throw anyone else to the wolves without pausing to think about it if it serves him to do so. Oliver Reed really makes the movie work because he brings genuine menance and sexuality to his role which serves as a counterpoint for the sweetness of the musical as a whole.And finally Mark Lester. He is beyond winsome as the title character a completely believable innocent who is without guile and imbued with a natural sense of goodness. I just love looking at Mark Lester he's such a beautiful and dreamylooking child.This movie is about as good as a musical gets it's visually stunning in the sets and the cinematography and the costumes and in the staging of the musical numbers. The characters are wonderful they're classics. The plot is pared down to the basics and conveys the material as Dickens wrote it without being slavish or getting bogged down in detail.When I saw this movie for the first time I laughed and I cried and I sat at the edge of my seat and when it was over I wanted more.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm reviewing the situation. Can a fellow be a villain all his life? Oliver!  is my favorite Musical of all time but it could very well be called Fagin!  because Ron Moody's performance as Fagin is truly the highlight of the film. He shines in every scene he's in and his musical pieces You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two and Reviewing the Situation are the best ones in the movie. Even Oliver's buddy the Artful Dodger played by Jack Wild steals each scene he shares with Mark Lester who plays the main character Oliver. The film which is based on Lionel Bart's musical adaptation of Charles Dickens's novel Oliver Twist had been produced for the stage in London before they decided to turn it into a film. The screenplay adaptation for the movie was written by Vernon Harris. The characters are just as I would have imagined them from reading Dickens's novel and I don't have a problem with Fagin and The Artful Dodger stealing the show from the protagonist because that is what happens most of the time with Dickens's main characters in his novels. He is so good at creating remarkable characters and I remember these two were the most memorable in the novel as well. Oliver Twist serves more as a symbol of innocence and purity among an evil world that has turned its back on him and his goodness proves to be incorruptible even among these villains he lives with. I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens and I really believe this film lived up to it although it was very loosely based on the novel because you just can't fit everything into the movie and some of the characters had to be left out Monks Mrs. Maylie Henry and Rose for example or they didn't have much screen time as is the case with Mr. Bumble.The movie begins in a workhouse several miles from London where several young orphans are forced to work and live under harsh conditions. One of the orphans Oliver Twist Mark Lester is chosen by the rest of the kids to ask for more food because it is hardly enough. Oliver is a shy good looking kid but when he asks Mr. Bumble Harry Secombe for more food he is instantly put in discipline for misconduct. He decides to sell the boy because he has become an inconvenience. Oliver eventually escapes and is able to arrive at London where he meets another young boy about his age who introduces himself as The Artful Dodger Jack Wild. The Dodger offers Oliver a place to sleep and introduces him to Fagin Ron Moody and the rest of the boys. Fagin happens to be a thief who trains the children how to pick a pocket and steal valuable goods like wallets and handkerchiefs from distracted men in the streets. Oliver is innocent and doesn't really understand what is going on until the day he goes on his very first mission with the Dodger and he is mistakenly accused of stealing a man's wallet. Oliver is finally declared innocent after an eyewitness claims it was another boy who was trying to steal the wallet and Mr. Brownlow Joseph O'Conner apologizes to him and adopts him at his home. In the meantime Fagin is worried the boy will give up his hideout along with his partner in crime Bill Sikes Oliver Reed. Bill forces his girlfriend Nancy Shani Wallis to kidnap Oliver and bring him back and the plot develops from that point on.Oliver! won six Oscars in 1968 including best picture and was the last musical to win an Oscar until Chicago won it in 2005. Carol Reed also won for best direction and he really raised the bar for musicals ever since. It was probably the last of the great musicals. Perhaps the hardest character to portray in this film from the novel was Nancy because she is torn between her love for Bill and doing the right thing for Oliver. Shani Wallis does a good job of portraying this inner struggle which eventually leads her to her fate. Oliver Reed had to portray the darkest and most evil character of the novel Bill Sikes and he does a good job as well. Some of the other musical numbers I enjoyed were Who Will Buy?  and OomPahPah. The art directions and scenery were also really well done for the time period. I don't know if I would of enjoyed the movie as much as I did if it weren't for Moody's performance. He was great and I think he should have won the Oscar for Best Secondary Actor. Robin Williams's performance in August Rush was probably influenced by Moody's character in this film. He was just a pleasure to watch on screen and is the main reason why I like this Musical so much. I am not a big fan of musicals but this is definitely my favorite one and I recommend it.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

Not only did he scare the life out of my when I watched it as a 6 year old but now as a woman I can empathize more with Nancys character the bar maidprostitute who helps Oliver get the life he deserves.Jack Wilde as the artful dodger was fantastic and I don't think anybody could ever outdo him as the streetpocket picker and best friend of Fagin. The music is fantastic especially Fagin's numbers I'm also quite thankful they didn't give Bill Sikes a musical number it wouldn't of worked with him being such a sinister character.I think Carol Reed did an excellent job of Nancy's sticky ending keeping it a G rated movie by disguising her beating but giving enough away to show the violence of Bill towards her. This movie is both charming and charismatic as a musical singalong as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life.".

	schema:reviewBody "The great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970. This twenty year spell can be rightly labelled the Golden Era of the genre. There were musicals prior to that and there have been musicals since but the true classics seem invariably to have been made during that period. Singin In The Rain An American In Paris The Band Wagon Seven Brides For Seven Brothers Oklahoma South Pacific The King And I and many more stand tall as much cherished products of the age. Perhaps the last great musical of the Golden Era is Carol Reeds 1968 Oliver. Freely adapted from Dickens novel this vibrant musical is a film version of a successful stage production. It is a magnificent film winner of six Oscars including the Best Picture award.Orphan Oliver Twist Mark Lester lives a miserable existence in a workhouse his mother having died moments after giving birth to him. Following an incident one mealtime he is booted out of the workhouse and ends up employed at a funeral parlour. But Oliver doesnt settle particularly well into his new job and escapes after a few troubled days. He makes the long journey to London where he hopes to seek his fortune. Oliver is taken under the wing of a child pickpocket called the Artful Dodger Jack Wild who in turn works for Fagin Ron Moody an elderly crook in charge of a gang of childthieves.

	onyx:emotionText "The great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970. This twenty year spell can be rightly labelled the Golden Era of the genre. There were musicals prior to that and there have been musicals since but the true classics seem invariably to have been made during that period. Singin In The Rain An American In Paris The Band Wagon Seven Brides For Seven Brothers Oklahoma South Pacific The King And I and many more stand tall as much cherished products of the age. Perhaps the last great musical of the Golden Era is Carol Reeds 1968 Oliver. Freely adapted from Dickens novel this vibrant musical is a film version of a successful stage production. It is a magnificent film winner of six Oscars including the Best Picture award.Orphan Oliver Twist Mark Lester lives a miserable existence in a workhouse his mother having died moments after giving birth to him. Following an incident one mealtime he is booted out of the workhouse and ends up employed at a funeral parlour. But Oliver doesnt settle particularly well into his new job and escapes after a few troubled days. He makes the long journey to London where he hopes to seek his fortune. Oliver is taken under the wing of a child pickpocket called the Artful Dodger Jack Wild who in turn works for Fagin Ron Moody an elderly crook in charge of a gang of childthieves. Despite the unlawful nature of the job Oliver finds good friends among his new family. He also makes the acquaintance of Nancy Shani Wallis girlfriend of the cruellest and most feared thief of them all the menacing Bill Sikes Oliver Reed.

	schema:headline " Not a total dog but still not even half as good";
	schema:reviewBody "I remembered seeing the advertisement for this movie at my local theater when it came out. But I was unaware of the nightmare it was to film it  release it all I did know was that it was in  out of the theater faster than COOL AS ICE. I had no idea this movie even existed until I read James Robert Parish's book FIASCO which has a chapter on the making of TOWN  COUNTRY...and which rest assured is more funny  believable than what shows up on the screen.After searching relatively high  low to find this movie it was released on DVD but logically stores do not exactly keep a copy on hand I watched it knowing about its history  that chances are I would likely want to throw things at the screen. I am glad to say I made it through the first viewing alive but will start by saying that no this movie is not a winner in the slightest. Yet is it an allaround creative bomb? Not so fast.Starting to film without a complete script was the oldest mistake in the book  they made it. Yet while it may have been a patchwork effort without much rhyme or reason some lines were funny  rather inspired most of them coming from Garry Shandling who almost walks away with the movie such as it is. Maybe having mature veteran actors mouth some of the more scatological dialogue as if this was supposed to be a senior's version of American PIE was not wise but that is often funny to watch in itself. Diane Keaton's line near the end Is there any women in this room you haven't slept with? could easily be what audiences have been wondering for years. The only thing the script missed was continuity  structure and all that showed on the screen resulting in a film that looked  acted choppy with many characters played by big names being reduced to glorified cameos making you wonder if there is a lot left on the cutting room floor but we cannot blame the editor for all that seeing as how they did not have much to work with. The producers should have been well aware that working with Warren Beatty a famously noncommittal perfectionist was not going to be clear sailing. Part of if not all the script problems can be laid at his door since he kept insisting on changes to the dialogue taking up time  most obviously money. And of course Warren was in his early 60s when he made this movie playing the same old Casanova he always did. Audiences most especially the young people who make up a large part of who goes to the movies are not going to buy that anymore or are unwilling to try. The studio should have saw this in the beginning  realized the chances of a box office success were slim to none and thus rein in the budget before it went haywire.After reading Parish's book  seeing just how things went bad with TOWN  COUNTRY I rather think a movie about the making of a movie like TOWN  COUNTRY would have been better and with all the same actors.

	onyx:emotionText "I remembered seeing the advertisement for this movie at my local theater when it came out. But I was unaware of the nightmare it was to film it  release it all I did know was that it was in  out of the theater faster than COOL AS ICE. I had no idea this movie even existed until I read James Robert Parish's book FIASCO which has a chapter on the making of TOWN  COUNTRY...and which rest assured is more funny  believable than what shows up on the screen.After searching relatively high  low to find this movie it was released on DVD but logically stores do not exactly keep a copy on hand I watched it knowing about its history  that chances are I would likely want to throw things at the screen. I am glad to say I made it through the first viewing alive but will start by saying that no this movie is not a winner in the slightest. Yet is it an allaround creative bomb? Not so fast.Starting to film without a complete script was the oldest mistake in the book  they made it. Yet while it may have been a patchwork effort without much rhyme or reason some lines were funny  rather inspired most of them coming from Garry Shandling who almost walks away with the movie such as it is. Maybe having mature veteran actors mouth some of the more scatological dialogue as if this was supposed to be a senior's version of American PIE was not wise but that is often funny to watch in itself. Diane Keaton's line near the end Is there any women in this room you haven't slept with? could easily be what audiences have been wondering for years. The only thing the script missed was continuity  structure and all that showed on the screen resulting in a film that looked  acted choppy with many characters played by big names being reduced to glorified cameos making you wonder if there is a lot left on the cutting room floor but we cannot blame the editor for all that seeing as how they did not have much to work with. The producers should have been well aware that working with Warren Beatty a famously noncommittal perfectionist was not going to be clear sailing. Part of if not all the script problems can be laid at his door since he kept insisting on changes to the dialogue taking up time  most obviously money. And of course Warren was in his early 60s when he made this movie playing the same old Casanova he always did. Audiences most especially the young people who make up a large part of who goes to the movies are not going to buy that anymore or are unwilling to try. The studio should have saw this in the beginning  realized the chances of a box office success were slim to none and thus rein in the budget before it went haywire.After reading Parish's book  seeing just how things went bad with TOWN  COUNTRY I rather think a movie about the making of a movie like TOWN  COUNTRY would have been better and with all the same actors. What went on behind the scenes was funny  screwball in itself and most of all it was not even scripted at all.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was BAD!! It had a totally incoherent plot that was doomed right from the getgo. The movie felt so choppy and badly edited considering it was reedited and rewrote many times. Characters went from one place to another without any reason. I mean one minute Porter was in bed with a lady he met just a few movie minutes agoand then he was back home again. I couldn't understand what the hell was going on in the movie most of the time. The only saving grace that kept me from totally tuning this film out was when Jenna Elfman came on screen but her role was so miscast and she didn't fit in at all with the dumb story. This movie made little sense and was way too serious to be considered a comedy. There wasn't much at all funny about this. I probably laughed maybe twice and they weren't even good laughs either. Town and Country spent 3 years gathering dust on the shelf before it was pulled down and finally finished and the result was this fiasco. There was a great cast of actors and actresses who all had successful careers before this film three of them won Oscars. Now after this film some of these people are struggling to find work such as Warren Beatty who hasn't been in a film since this one. Others have been more lucky such as Diane Keaton and Elfman and the director managed to stay a float as he did some other films that weren't exactly home runs Hannah Montana The Movie but fared far better than T  C. The only thing I got out of this movie A man cheats on his wife pays the consequences another man does the same thing then comes out as gay and a man comes in with a shotgun. Oh and the polar bear scene that was rather strange and kind of funny. The movie's dumb cheesy ending didn't give me any bit of hope that I would like to come back and give this film another shot to try to make some sense out of it. I kept on checking the time to see when this train wreck would end. It really did feel like the cast and crew had to find a way to end the nightmare so the ending it was.I expected this movie to be a disaster based on what I read about it being one of the biggest box office flops in American film history and reading reviews.

BeattyKeatonHawn etc go through the paces like the pros they are. If ultimately it didn't add up to much well you could say that about every other movie released these days. I particularly enjoyed Charlton Heston as an overbearing father of a womanAndie McDowell who gets fixated with Beatty. I'd like to have been on the set listening to the conversations between the liberal Beatty and coservative Heston. I'm not sure what the delay in its release was all about but obviously something went wrong. I think Beatty basically disowned it. Still its a decent lightweight comedy. Doesn't wear out its welcome and provided a decent evening's entertainment. Something Scary Movie 2 and its ilk  doesn't provide.Anyway it worked for me.".

BeattyKeatonHawn etc go through the paces like the pros they are. If ultimately it didn't add up to much well you could say that about every other movie released these days. I particularly enjoyed Charlton Heston as an overbearing father of a womanAndie McDowell who gets fixated with Beatty. I'd like to have been on the set listening to the conversations between the liberal Beatty and coservative Heston. I'm not sure what the delay in its release was all about but obviously something went wrong. I think Beatty basically disowned it. Still its a decent lightweight comedy. Doesn't wear out its welcome and provided a decent evening's entertainment. Something Scary Movie 2 and its ilk  doesn't provide.Anyway it worked for me.";

While the film does tend to not take affairs in marriage seriously enough it is somewhat redeemed by the attempt at a heartfelt ending. Besides despite the fact that what is going on is atrocious as far as infidelity it is terribly amusing.Kudos to Charlton Heston whose character's role along with that of his character's wife makes one of the funniest couples I've seen on film.I've read mean reviews proclaiming that this film is only for rich people with no sense of humor. I have a decent sense of humor good enough to know that most of the nonNaked Gun Leslie Nielsen movies weren't very funny I'm certainly not rich and I loved this movie.

With more production problems than my neighbor's dog has flees I was not expecting the film to be of any extraordinary quality. It isn't. I did considering the respectable cast and crew expect to laugh. I did but not enough. This is the kind of comedy where we laugh when the jokes are presented but there are not enough of them. Therefore we want more but the movie never deliversleaving us with a feeling of disappointment. With a budget of over 90 million and shooting dates that range over three years this film should have been the pearl of the ocean. Although Town  Country has its moments of hilarity insight and interest the film as a whole does not quite work.Town  Country stars Warren Beatty whose previous satire Bulworth offered more biting comedy than this film multiplied by three. He plays Porter Stoddard an acclaimed New York architect who is having an affair with a beautiful married musician Nastassja Kinski. Porter has a wealthy lifestyle and a loving wife Ellie Diane Keaton who suspects nothing from her husband for 25 years. The Stoddard's have a closenit friendship with another couple Mona Goldie Hawn and Griffin Garry Shandling from What Planet Are You From?. Griffin is also committing adultery but his wife discovers his betrayal and immediately dumps himeven though she is not exactly faithful herself. The setup is basically just a clothesline from which other related situations evolve. Although often interesting adultery isn't enough to develop a story over 100 minutes in length. The movie begins well after some painful music during the opening credits but stumbles very early with its characters wandering from scene to scene with nothing much to do or say. Then the story becomes redundant with Porter making the same mistakes repeatedly. But surprisingly there is very little tension involved with the plot simply because we do not care about the characters. There is just not enough at stake here. There are a few hilarious scenes that transpire when the characters attempt to cover up their deceitful decisions and the actors are consistently fun to watch with likable chemistry and energy. The cast does a great job with their charismatic and entertaining performances making this movie relatively easy to watch. But even they can't bring enough life into this otherwise desperate deprived material.Town  Country is clearly trying to say that people can engage in adultery without much effort or thought but it is not fulfilling or constructive. During the film's closing minutes Porter explains in a scene much too obvious for its own good that sex has not filled the emptiness inside him. We never believe that Porter felt such loneliness however for several reasons1  Warren Beatty does not do a convincing job at executing his character's emotions. All of the characters feel very external. We seldom feel anything for any of them.2  The story runs into a particularly noticeable series of problems during its last third. When it should be calming down focusing in on the character's emotional areas it does exactly the opposite introduces new events completely unrelated to the material before. We also meet numerous characters that only distract us from the movie's theme. There is some funny material within these segments of the movie but for the most part these sequences really detour the plot.Town  Country isn't as bad as many people are saying. It is just a disappointment considering the ample potential. With 90 million dollars over three years and names like Warren Beatty Diane Keaton Goldie Hawn Garry Shandling Andie MacDowell and Charlton Heston we come to expect a whole lot more. I have seen special effects laden action thrillers made for half the cost of Town  Country and much less talent but so much more was projected on the screen. The only thing this production does with its talent and money is prove that raunchy sex comedies can be made with older generations too.".

Good move gals!Lastly let me see that as a comedy aficionado and one who's a real fan of humorous dialogue too many times I've attended films where the actors' lines are drowned out by the raucous laughter of the audience. I was happy to observe that in Town  Country even during the funniest scenes the theater was dead quiet. So that all the lines could be heard and savored.

But is that a fault? Big Business builds comedic tension early on and sustains it throughout by clever use of supporting characters and the subtle way that from their scenes with them we learn about the 4 leads.The eternal dilemma of nature v nurture is portrayed in a fairly nonpreachy way coupled with a similar approach to town v country. To do this in a farce containing 4 romances plus all the rest is a tall order for any moviemaker but this rich premise is cleverly negotiated by Jim Abrahams  the writers with only a handful of misfires.Now I'm not one for romances but the studly Fred Ward who was unbelievably 46 years old at the time as the whiter than white Roone Dimmick manages an amazing feat  his meeting and courting of Lily Tomlin in the space of a few minutes is carried off quite plausibly by this accomplished and underrated actor and is a joy to behold.10 out of 10 and a real shame that there is no more from these 2 writers.".

It has an excellent pedigree with Jim Abrahams directing and Dean Cundey manning the camera and the leads are definitely up to the challenge of dualie roles.It is unusual for a comedy to have the strong viewpoint and values expressed in this movie. Fred Ward's Rune talks about the simple pleasures of living in the rural country and you know that somebody involved with the script knew those pleasures personally. The characters rarely become stereotypes. Even the secondary characters are treated with respect.Dean Cundey Director of Photography must have been specializing in trick photography as he went on to shoot Back to the Future 2 and 3 with even better results.

	schema:reviewBody "The 1988 film Big Business directed by Jim Abrahams stars two wellknown actresses Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin who both play duel roles of twins mixed up at birth in the 1940s. The names chosen for both sets of twins were Rose and Sadie. The Shelton twins were born to a wealthy couple from New York the Ratliff twins are from a lowincome family that lived in Jupiter Hollow. One of the Shelton twins was given to the Ratliff family and viceversa. Jump forty plus years to the 1980s. The Shelton twins inherited their father's corporation Moramax in New York City and the Ratliff twins work at the HollowMade Factory in Jupiter Hollow the town in which they were born. Moramax is planning to shut down the factory and to stripmine Jupiter Hollow. The Ratliff's come to New York City to save the factory and town from the Shelton's corporation. Both the Ratliff's and Shelton's stay in the Plaza Hotel in NYC not knowing their real twins were also there. They end up meeting each other right before Moramax's big meeting and Rose Shelton agrees with Sadie and Rose Ratliff to save the factory and Jupiter Hollow. Big Business presents two central ideas. One idea is that two sets of twins can be born on the same night in the same hospital can be switched at birth and can meet one another later in life. Another idea would be that the big guy doesn't always win. The big guy in this movie would be the Moramax corporation and the little guy would be the HollowMade Factory. I say this because at the end of the movie the Ratliff's end up saving their town and factory from the Shelton's large corporation. I thought that this movie was hilarious it receives five stars. I watch this movie over and over and never seem to get tired of it. I loved how both Midler and Tomlin play two completely opposite roles redneck and snobbish. The southern accents in my opinion were excellent. This movie is similar to the Green Acres television show only the rednecks end up in New York City. I wish that the director would make a sequel to see how Jupiter Hollow the factory and Moramax are doing.".

It's very important what humor in Big Business is very kind and not vulgar and therefore it's a perfect movie for evening watching with family. By the way I was nice surprised seen in this film an Italian actor Michele Placido who I remember as Commissario Corrado Cattani from excellent old TV show La piovra. He was a hero for me and my friends in my childhood. Then he was very serious and brutal but in Big Business he is incredibly funny and it's stunningly.".

	schema:headline " Chabrol plays Russian roulette with the French New Wave and wins";
	schema:reviewBody "Les Cousins is definitively part of the French New Wave of the late 1950s. Whilst slightly more polished than the films of his contemporaries notably Godard and Truffaut Chabrol's film bubbles with an insurgence of new cinematographic techniques and fresh acting talent.  The sense of newness is reinforced by presence of so many young actors dressed elegantly in tuxedos and evening dresses but acting somewhat delinquently for the most part. The film appears almost like the christening party for the birth of a new era in French cinema.Both the direction and photography are of a high calibre and capture very well the changing mood of the central character  Charles.  The film starts cheerfully and optimistically with the young man's arrival in Paris.  Like him we are enchanted by the bright lights the wide boulevards and the historic monuments.  But then little by little the mood changes to ennui and disappointment when the shallowness of the Paris jet set is revealed. Finally a much darker mood prevails as Charles' best efforts to succeed are brutally crushed by a combination of circumstances partly of his own making but largely as a result of the hand of fate.  This ability to alter the mood of the film so subtly and effectively is one of Chabrol's great skills as a director and is used to far greater effect in some of his subsequent thrillers.Both of the two central characters Charles and Paul are played admirably by Grard Blain and JeanClaude Brialy.  Blain manages to capture the innocence of the outsider and offers a sympathetic and memorable performance.  Brialy seems to revel in his role as the extravagant city student hosting his parties with the gusto of a true bonvivant whilst exhibiting a more complicated and sensitive persona in his conversations with the characters Charles and Florence.Both actors were used by Chabrol in an earlier film Le Beau Serge which in some ways is the mirror image of Les Cousins. In Le Beau Serge Brialy played a city boy who returns to his home in a provincial town where he met up wih a childhood friend played by Blain.  Brialy's character was the outsider and ultimately he was destroyed by his alien surroundings.   In Les Cousins the situation is cleverly reversed.  Here Blain's character is a country boy who joins Brialy in the city of Paris.  It is Blain's character who is now the outsider and who is finally destroyed by his unfamiliar environment.  It is interesting to watch the two films backtoback to note the similarities and compare the differences.  Both films seem to side with the outsider and condemn the society that rejects him although it is perhaps disappointing that in both cases that the outsider is destroyed without having any significant impact on the society that crushed him.  At least in Le Beau Serge the victim's fate was sealed by an altruistic desire to do some good for the community that rejected him whereas in Les Cousins the victim brought his destruction on himself by trying to attack the society he felt so repulsive.Les Cousins lacks the emotional intensity of Le Beau Serge and appears in some places a little too stagemanaged.  The ending is particularly stagy but it works perfectly to the film's advantage.  On the plus side Les Cousins benefits from a far superior musical score a more interesting set of characters and some impressive location filming in Paris.  It is an engaging and accessible film which still appears fresh and vibrant.".

When Charles comes to stay with him while he goes to college he is quite the contrast to Paul who is a confident ladies' man. He's also more bookish and introspective than Paul. All Paul wants is to have a good time and have sexand he couldn't care less about his studies at the college. And in a way Paul has contempt for his cousin when Charles falls head over heels for Florenceand he soon beds Florence and asks her to move in with him. As for Charles he is sad but sinks his energy into his classwork and tries to do the right thing. What's next for this odd mismatched pair? Bet you won't be able to guess!This film is considered by many to be one of the best and earliest New Wave films. Like many New Wave movies the normal film formulas are turned on their head and goodness isn't necessarily rewarded and the ending is quite ambiguous. Well worth seeing and darkly enjoyable.".

Incidentally the film forms a trilogy of sorts with Chabrol's other tales of amoral youth all stemming from the vitriolic pen of the illfated Paul Gegauff i.e. LES BONNES FEMMES 1960 and WISE GUYS 1961. Unfortunately I did not watch this in the most congenial atmosphere  being a recording off French TV with subtitles in that language it is odd that such an essential piece in both the director's canon and the influential New Wave filmography seems to be otherwise unavailable!. Anyway having sensed a nod to Fellini in Chabrol's THE CHAMPAGNE MURDERS 1967 I can see definite links with this earlier effort especially Brialy interrupting a wild party at his flat with a candlelit recital of an epic German poem  and which actually predates a similar occurrence in LA DOLCE VITA 1960 itself!The film is also notable for being Stephane Audran's first collaboration out of a total of 23! with Chabrol though her role is secondary and a sluttish one at that the actress  with hair dyed blonde  manages to make an impression nevertheless she obviously did on her director since they would eventually be married until 1980. Actually the leading lady here is doeeyed Juliette Mayniel soon to play an unwilling donor in Georges Franju's EYES WITHOUT A FACE 1960  ironically one of several distinguished native directors dismissed as archaic by Godard et al not an actress usually attached to the New Wave movement but who acquits herself exceedingly well under the circumstances.Other characters within the narrative include yet another ambiguous and in this case much older livein figure who also acts as a bad influence on the heroine and a librarian harboring almost paternal feelings for Blain. The film's abrupt tragic ending casually treated by the director and deemed pointless by some would seem to be suggesting that the bustle of city life spells the death of innocence especially for someone not attuned to its grinding pace.P.S. With this I concluded my nearly twomonth tribute to the octogenarian French master that included 27 films all of them being first viewings! and I regret not having had more time to revisit some of his other work  particularly A' DOUBLE TOUR 1959 LES BONNES FEMMES TEN DAYS WONDER 1971 and INNOCENTS WITH DIRTY HANDS 1975! For the record I intend to pursue a similar retrospective for JeanLuc Godard who will himself turn 80 next December".

I understand the meaning and the message of the film but practically nothing captivated me Neither the characters nor Charles's own character captivated me nor the rhythm of the film a very long sequence in which we get to know Paul's friends who swim and the way the bourgeoisie is presented to us there are immense films that capture this social class in a much more skilful and humorous way nor the message of the film which I find to be inadequate and unlikely in the form how it is performed.

	schema:reviewBody "Early in the year 2000 director Steven Soderbergh's film Erin Brokovich sizzled at the box office  bringing in over 130 million while receiving critical acclaim.  Now with the release of his latest film Traffic Soderbergh stands to earn Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Picture for both of these movies.  It's no wonder either as Traffic is one of the most gripping films to hit theatres in 2000.Traffic takes on the complex issues involved with the war on drugs in the United States and Mexico from the view of these nations as a whole to the very personal level.  In the film three  stories unfold to illustrate the near impossibility of ever stopping the drug trade despite the billion dollars that the US spends each year for just that cause.  While the tales are related the characters rarely if ever cross paths with one another. This is one of the elements that allows Soderbergh to deliver his message so effectively.The first story features Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.  A cop in Baja Mexico he enforces the law and allows the wheels to be greased from time to time.  After pulling off a huge drug bust on the Juarez drug cartel the powerful General Salazar swoops in to confiscate all of the drugs and the credit.  Later Javier and his partner are recruited by Salazar to fight the war on drugs by aiding him in bringing down the Obregon cartel that has plagued Tijuana for some time.Meanwhile back in the States Judge Robert Wakefield Michael Douglas of the Ohio Supreme Court is about to be appointed by the President as the nation's new leader in the drug war. For the judge the drug war is about to become more personal than he could ever have imagined.In San Diego Monty Don Cheadle and Ray Luis Guzman are two federal agents perpetrating a drug bust on a slimy drug supplier named Eduardo Ruiz Miguel Ferrer.  The events that follow lead them up the drug food chain to Carlos Ayala a welltodo suburban man who has been smuggling illegal drugs into the country from Mexico.   His arrest leaves his pregnant wife Helena Katherine ZetaJones who was really pregnant during the film to fend for herself while taking care of their son court costs and a 3 million dollar debt to the drug lords in Mexico.Traffic written by Simon Moore the writer for the British miniseries Traffik upon which this script is based is superbly crafted and woven. We learn just enough about each character to give us some insight into their motives for the courses they choose to follow.  By the films end matters are not neatly wrapped up there is not a fairy tale ending.  This simply adds to the realism of the issues presented within the movie.  Furthermore the intertwining stories drive home the fact that drugs are closer to you than you think.The script is bolstered by the phenomenal ensemble cast.  ZetaJones and Del Toro have both received Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Actor in a drama for their roles in this film.  Don Cheadle is superb in his role.  Michael Douglas gives his usual performance while Erika Christensen does a good job as his daughter.  Topher Grace of TV's That 70's Show is excellent as her upperclass druggie boyfriend.  Dennis Quid's character while played adequately is underused.The stories were shot using various filters and lenses neatly separating them as the film went from one to another and adding to the viewing pleasure of the movie. Mexico is filmed through a hand held camera and yellow lens to give it a dry grainy shaky look that heightens the feel of unrest involved with Del Toro's situation.  Douglas' story is initially filmed in a hue of solemn comforting blue.  ZetaJones' story is filmed without the use of lenses suggesting that her situation and actions are the most realistic and achievable of all those presented.Despite some dialogue that spouts off statistics and seems a bit preachy Traffic ranks among the top ten films of 2000 surpassing even Soderbergh's other venture Erin Brokovich.  Don't be surprised if this film picks up the Oscar for Best Picture.By film's end the message is clear and powerful. The fight against drugs is a long uphill battle but it is better than no battle at all.".

	schema:headline " Soderbergh's best film is a thrilling ride...";
	schema:reviewBody "The film more than delivers on every level and is certainly a lock for Best Picture of the year. Soderbergh has been on an astonishing roll demonstrating exceptional versatility in his choice of genres and tremendous agility in balancing artistry with entertainment. He's been America's most consistently brilliant and unpredictable filmmaker for the last decade and Traffic is the culminating work of his career. First and foremost it's a richly entertaining epic that recalls the great works of the 1970s when directors like Robert Altman and Francis Ford Coppola engaged mass audiences with works of genuine substance. Soderbergh works on a larger canvass than he's ever done before bouncing several characters and plotlines against and off each other so that images and themes rhyme and echo. Although the subject matter is drug trafficking this is not an issues movie per se. Instead it's a profoundly affecting dramatic thriller where the destructive forces of drugs cut across different sections of society. What's most impressive about the direction is how Soderbergh manages to avoid both sentimentalizing and moralizing about drugs. As with Erin Brockovich there's a graceful absence of selfimportance and bombast in the presentation. However this doesn't mean the film lacks a strong point of view.Stylistically this film represents a major breakthrough. Soderbergh shot the film himself under the pseudonym Peter Andrews and Traffic takes all of his past experiments with color available light and handheld work lightyears beyond The Limey and Out of Sight. He has created a brilliant style that could best characterized as expressionistic naturalism. His loose handheld style lends the film an extremely spontaneous realistic tone but the modifications of color amplify the drama. Each storyline has its own distinct look that accentuates the emotions underlining the film. The Mexico story involving Benicio Del Toro is told in earthy saturated yellows the story of Michael Douglas and his daughter Erika Christensen is told in an aquarium blue while the Catherine ZetaJones Luis GuzmanDon Cheadle story gets a natural available light look. In addition to being visually striking and cool in a completely unpretentious manner Soderbergh's camera technique transcends mere virtuosity and actually becomes another character in the film. As usual with Soderbergh the film is edited with musical verve and skill where time is collapsed and expanded and characters are seen reflecting on past actions.I've been remiss in not discussing the acting earlier. This film has an amazing ensemble cast where everybody is working at the top of their game. However Benicio Del Toro definitely stands out with the breakthrough performance. I don't think it's accidental that the movie begins and ends with shots of him. He plays Javier Rodriguez a Mexican police officer caught in a futile and corrupt system and it's as compelling of a character as Michael Corleone. Del Toro is exceptionally relaxed and subtle keeping his thoughts and feelings private from the other characters in the films but sharing it with the camera. Del Toro navigates the audience through a world of impossible choices and moral corruption quietly simmering with intense conflict just beneath the surface.  Benicio's been an indie stalwart for years but this film should shoot his stock through the roof. If there's justice in this world he'll be rewarded with Best Actor Awards aplenty.Michael Douglas is also terrific adding another strong performance to his gallery of flawed men in power. He shows genuine fear and vulnerability in a harrowing scene in which he searches for his daughter in a drug dealer's den. I've never seen Erika Christensen before but she makes an impressive debut.  Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman they should star as a team in every movie! are as loose limber and spontaneous as ever providing plenty of comic relief as well as keeping it real. Catherine ZetaJones takes a complete 180 from her past roles and admirably plays against her looks appearing very pregnant while thrown into gritty surroundings. Dennis Quaid is appropriately slimy as a corrupt lawyer.Anyway film geeks and anybody else starved for a genuine piece of filmmaking should breathe a sigh of relief and give thanks that Soderbergh has come to save the day.".

	schema:headline " The Real Best Film of 2000";
	schema:reviewBody "A dazzlingly complex film Traffic' takes a hard unflinching look at the socalled war on drugs' that is perfectly clear and uncompromising. Director Steven Soderbergh takes the various viewpoints of the drug culture  the users the dealers the police and the politicians  and weaves their differing stories together into a single story that is both deep in its ideas but very simple to understand.  In terms of story direction and characters Traffic' is easily Soderbergh's best film to date and one of the best films made in recent years period.Traffic' takes a look at the world of drugs through the stories and lives of different characters.  Some are loosely connected to one another some are not.  There is the story of Javier Rodriguez Benicio Del Toro a Mexican policeman struggling to keep his distance from the corruption that seems to follow him everywhere there is the story of Ray Castro Luis Guzman and Montel Gordon Don Cheadle two DEA agents trying to turn the lowlevel drug dealer Eduardo Ruiz Miguel Ferrer against his drug cartel boss there's the story of Helena Ayala Catherine ZetaJones the unsuspecting wife of the drug cartel boss who suddenly learns who her husband really is and what he does for a living and then there's the new head of the DEA Robert Wakefield Michael Douglas a man so wrapped up in his mission to stop the war on drug he fails to notice that his own daughter Caroline Erika Christensen is becoming addicted to crack.  Much like in the real world the events of each story directly or indirectly affect the events of the others leaving all the characters to consider their roles in the drug culture . . . and what if anything they can do to change those roles.In terms of story Traffic' is absolutely brilliant.  I'm still amazed that the film could cover so many plotlines and dozens of characters so effortlessly.  Each story  whether it's Helena assuming the role of her drugdealing husband or Robert canceling DEA meetings so he can deal with his drugaddicted daughter  is powerful and brutally honest.  Traffic' isn't afraid to look at tough or uncomfortable issues.  Traffic' somewhat surprisingly never preaches either  while it's safe to say that the message of the film is essentially antidrug it never comes out and outright says that message.  A lesser film would've had some grandiose speech imbedded somewhere in the film denouncing the use of drugs  not Traffic'.  It's wise enough to let the viewer take what messages they want from the film without ever preaching.  A minor quibble  did Michael Douglas' character really have to be the new drug czar of the United States? The fact that he was the top law enforcement drug official in the U.S. and that his daughter was addicted to drug . . . well it seemed a little too farfetched and a little too movielike.  If Mr. Douglas had been playing ONE of the top drug officials in the federal government instead of THE top official I would've found his character to be infinitely more believable.Soderbergh's also at the top of his game with his direction of Traffic'. The film is virtually filmed entirely with handheld camera giving each and every scene an upcloseandpersonal feel.  There's also a distinct lack of background music which lets the viewer feel like they're eavesdropping on reallife scenes and not just watching a movie.  These techniques make for a very personal intense experience.  Soderbergh also uses a technique he's used in some of his other films Out of Sight Erin Brockovich  certain scenes are filtered a specific color to heighten a mood or a sense of awareness of what's about to happen.  The scenes in Mexico featuring the Mexican detective Javier for example are all filmed in a very bright almost disorienting yellow.  It's a technique that can be irritating at times but for the most part it serves a bold purpose that truly adds to the film.As for the characters and the acting . . . jeez Traffic' is without a doubt one of the bestcast films of all time.  I mean it.  There are no weak links no poorly written characters and no badly played characters.  Each and every character adds something significant to the story in Traffic' and each and every actor is outstanding.  Kudos must go to possibly one of the best ensemble casts of all time.  Three actors in particular stand out though  Benicio Del Toro who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance Don Cheadle who was actually slightly better than the brilliant performance of Mr. Del Toro IMHO and Catherine ZetaJones. I'm normally loathe to use the word flawless' when describing a film but the casting of Traffic' was indeed flawless.Traffic' with its unflinching look at drug use in America today can be uncomfortable at times to watch.  It certainly can't be termed a happy' or a feelgood' film.  That doesn't change the fact that it is an amazing thoughtprovoking powerful film  and without a doubt the best film released in the year 2000.  I can't recommend this film enough.  Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "Traffic is an incredible movie. The director Steven Soderbergh sex lies and videotape out of sight erin brockovich etc... has created a film that combines elements of Hollywood and independent filmmaking. On one hand he has created an epic that has a very wide scope and has used some famous Hollywood actors. On the other hand as the cameraman for the film he has shot it with a handheld camera and and makes the film visually very different from traditional films. He presents the drug war in the United States from three perspectives. The first is of a police officer superbly played by Benicio del Toroin Tijuana struggling with the difficult situations that such a job creates in the center of drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States. Catherine Zeta Jones plays the wife of the leader of a drug cartel in San Diego who gets arrested. Once naive about his business she takes charge of the operations. The third story deals with the appointment of conservative Ohio Supreme Court justice Robert Wakefield played by Michael Douglas to the post of drug czar. This occurs while his daughter Caroline portrayed emotionally by Erika Christensen starts descending into a world of drugs thanks to her boyfriend Seth Abrahams. Topher Grace from That 70's Show plays Seth These three stories are distinguishable visually. The Tijuana story is shot with different tones of yellow giving everything that goes on in the story a feel similar to that of a hot desert. The San Diego story has warm soft colors representing Helena Ayala's Catherine Zeta Jones' character once peaceful social soccer mom life. Finally Cincinatti and Washington D.C. the cities where the story of the drug czar takes place is shot in a cold blue giving it an emotionless feel. Despite the importance of the visuals what makes this film that much better is the fact that Soderbergh does not moralize. There is not an antidrug stance but there is also not a strong advocacy of legalization. Traffic shows a problem with no current solution. The viewer has to decide for himself. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "It certainly has been a good 12 months for director Stephen Soderbergh hasn't it? Erin Brockovich probably the most underrated film of last year eventually got the recognition Soderbergh Roberts Co deserved as did this film a chilling account of drug trafficking in North and Central America. As seen in 'Erin Brockovich' Soderbergh often deals with people under immense pressure and this is quite evident here telling the story of a new US drug control officer Michael Douglas whose daughter is rapidly becoming a drug addict Erika Christensen. It also shows us the struggles of a drug trafficker's society wife Catherine ZetaJones whose husband is facing a conviction and also that of a cop accused of corruption. The direction is superb throughout speaking in tones very believable tones and contrasting atmospheres. The portrayal of Mexico as a behindthescenes nightmare world of seediness humidity you can almost FEEL the heat and as a place where one murder matters not is handled excellently Soderbergh quite cleverly using sepiatones to convey the mood. This high standard which is often difficult to maintain in a movie of its length 2  hours is maintained and while at times it borders on arty it is done thoughtfully incisively and effectively the scenes of importance delivered in tense muted tones. Javier Rodriguez's Benicio Del Toro character and personality is both strong and incredibly wellacted  the quiet thick skinned yet razorsharp mind suiting his environment perfectly and his acting is often crucial to the moods set in the film for example in creating the tense unearthly atmosphere of Mexico. This quiet confidence is also a key part of one of the film's many underlying messages namely a study in resourcefulness and where it gets us particularly in Catherine ZetaJones' character a trophy wife of a drug trafficker who is under arrest. Resourceful as she is it takes her down the darkest and lowest moral alleyways and this can be compared to 'Erin Brockovich' where another stressed woman used a different kind of soul and fighting spirit to get results. This film also deals with family life and the movie clich of 'daddy never being around' is handled exceptionally well. This time the daddy is the newlyinstated drugs officer Michael Douglas fighting drugs on two fronts the Mexican Border and his own home as he struggles to keep his adolescent daughter on the straight and narrow. The characters are all strong and well acted I can't put my finger on a single bad performance but Benicio Del Toro is by far the best on show and his Oscar was well deserved. Michael Douglas proves again that he's a class act as does Catherine ZetaJones and strength in depth is clear all round. All in all then a great film combining good acting clever psychological undertones and classy direction which particularly stands out. Combining an ability to keep us interested with the snappy modern style which he has brought to the movies today  this film is a gripping account and a very comprehensive display of Soderbergh's impressive arsenal of film knowledge understanding and talent.".

	schema:reviewBody "TRAFFIC  2000 12 out of fourTraffic caught some of the most gratifying praise in the year 2000. Does the production live up to its expectations? To some extent. It is not a movie to take the family to on a Sunday afternoon nor is it an entertaining popcorn extravaganza. Traffic is one of the best films of the year but it is not a movie for everyone. I had my fair share of disappointments and I think many audiences will walk away unsatisfied by its documentarylike style and unusual structure. Traffic is still a great achievement in filmmaking and visual styleworthy of some but not quite all of its great acclamation.The movie's director Steven Soderbergh won Oscar nominations for both of his movies last year Erin Brockovich starring Julia Roberts and this epic about the never ending war on drugs. That first film is entertaining and charming but this is far more complex in its story. There are actually three separate plots here the first detailing two Tijuana cops Benicio Del Toro and Jacob Vargas who find themselves in the middle of a corrupt police force working for Gereal Arturo Salazar Thomas Milian  Mexico's top drug aggressor who wants to shut down the Tijuana drug cartel by capturing a notorious assassin Clifton Collins Jr..The second story has Michael Douglas as a conservative Ohio State Supreme Court Judge turned nation's new drug czar. He has a savage job as we can see but it is even more difficult being the father of a 16yearold daughter Erika Christensen who gets straight A's in school but uses heavy drugs and eventually prostitutes herself for them when the supply runs low. Amy Irving plays her mother whom herself tried every kind of drug in the market when she was young and thinks her daughter should be given more freedom in this area of maturing. Her husband strongly disagrees. The third story is a bit more complicated dealing with the reactions of a typical pregnant homemaker Helena Catherine ZetaJones when she finds out her husband Carlos Ayala Steven Bauer is not an executive but a highpowered drug lord. He is taken into custody when undercover DEA agents Montel Gordon Don Cheadle and Ray Castro Luiz Guzman crack a disreputable drug cartel led by Juan Orbergon Benjamin Bratt. Helena with the help from her attorney Dennis Quaid must deal with the pressures by her husband's demanding enemies as well as the DEA. Miguel Ferrer plays the middlerun drug dealer who is captured by the DEA agents and wants immunity for testifying against the highpowered bosses for whom he works. Traffic does not have the harrowing compassionate hardtowatch tone that Requiem for a Dream had earlier last year which also contained three different although parallel stories.  That film depicted drug use as personal success followed by desolation and punishment. Traffic doesn't really make drugs personal although the plot featuring Michael Douglas' drug addicted daughter touches on the idea and the actors do a good job of making the character's attitudes hit home but the film is more about the war on drugs within America as a country and how it is a battle not likely to be won anytime soon. The picture does not capture the feeling of the characters like Requiem for a Dream did with its highly elaborate styles and camera effects. Traffic just isn't as emotionally profound as the much more worthy Requiem for a Dream.Steven Soderbergh does manage to capture an inciting style with grainy high contrast photography exploring the atmosphere of Mexico. He pays attention to even the smallest scenes. Take a scene where the Benicio De Toro character encounters a young married couple who complain about their stolen car. Many directors would have left this scene on the editing tables or paid less courtesy to it because it is not as important as many other scenes.  He gets the right mood confusion of the characters all while furthering the development of De Toro's character. Each individual scene here is interesting on its own merit. A top notch cast contributes superb performances in Traffic. We expect and receive good performances from actors like Michael Douglas Amy Irving Dennis Quaid Benicio Del Toro and Albert Finney but there are also some newcomers who shine with their material including Erika Christensen and Topher Gracer. The actors really hold our attention and with a running time of nearly 150 minutes that is imperative. This film is greatly constructed and perfectly castit is the kind of movie in which you walk out of the theater wanting to discuss your opinions about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Traffic 2000Like an abstract expressionist master Steven Soderbergh stands in the center of a canvas that stretches from Cincinnati to Tijuana.

	schema:reviewBody "Traffic is a fantastic movie. Let's start with saying that.I just got back from seeing it and it certainly rates as one of the best storybased drama's I've ever seen.  Being a big fan of movies with different storylines overlapping as Magnolia I was highly anticipating this movie. And of course the big oscar nominations and the prizes it already won made it even more desirable.It didn't let me down one bit. The different story's were all excellent. Being that the mexican one was in my opinion the best one. Especially Benicio Del Toro remember him in Fear and Loathing in Las vegas the BEST drugs movie ever being absolutely brilliant. But also the storyline involving Michael Douglas with his problems dealing with a daughter on drugs well acted out by newcomer Erika Christensen is remarkable. The topic drugs is clearly highly talked about especially in the United States and this is actually the first movie which shows all aspects of it. The dealing and smuggling the addiction the risks of being a narcotics agent and the political point of view. It's hard to find a film that's so complete everyone will feel connected to one of the storylines because everyone deals with or has dealt with drugs before even if it's just a one time mariuhana use. That's why this movie will appeal to a very large crowd.Anyway when you look at the flaws then maybe some will say that it takes too long or that some of the scenes are a bit slow. But does everything go fastpaced in real life? It just tries to sketch a realistic view of handling with drugs. And maybe there isn't a lot of action going on but that's not the goal of the movie.The only thing I found when watching the movie was that the switching between movielines happened a little too often. I'd preferred if it stayed with one story a little longer. Just a tiny flaw that I personally noted.Traffic is a film that has to sink in when you start to think about it it just gets better and better. I can't wait for the official release here in Holland so that I can see it again.Oscar for Del Toro in any case !!!!!! And throw in an oscar for best film too. It deserves it.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Mexico Officer Javier Rodriquez Rodriquez is stuck in the middel of a country where the drug dealers and the police work hand in hand and murder is rife.  In the USA the head of one of the cartels Javier is trying to close is taken to court by the DEA who have an informant Eduardo Ruiz in the custody of Agents Montel Gordon and Ray Castro leaving his wife Helena to take care of his business.  Over all this a new drug czar is appointed who begins to find that the war on drugs is not as simple as it seems and that it is a war raged in his own home.Based on the channel 4 series Traffik this is an openminded intelligent look at the war on drugs.  Looking at the problem across several interlinking stories allows us to hear everyone's side  to see the internal problems in Mexico to see the futility of the DEA's actions even to see the scope of the problem facing the US political machine as it tries to fight a war against the drugs trade on all sides. The stories are told with out over doing it  action happens without pomp or fanfare explosions happen in silence killings are brutal swift and final.  This is not an action movie. The thoughtful nature means the film moves slowly and if you're not used to following stories then it may frustrate you.  However those wishing something to get you thinking during and after the film should be rewarded.The film is intelligent far beyond the subject matter.  The direction and editing is perfect.  The scenes in Mexico are all yellow and washed out  giving a desolate feeling the scenes in political America are given a blue hue to give a colder detached feel to the business while the scenes with the DEA are noticeably bright and realistic.  This is typical of the intelligence put into the film  it rewards you the more you watch it.  The casting is another example of how right the film is.Del Toro is perfect  he gets the moodiness spot on but also has a fun side to his character.  Cheadle and Guzman are as good as they always are and play off each other well  they have an element of the buddy cop' couple without becoming caricatures.  Douglas is really good  how often can you say that!?  His young wife is also very good  I expected her to be the weak link but she gave a good performance.  These are the main players but really the cast is deep in quality from those that have bigger roles Quaid Bratt Miguel Ferrer to those that essentially have only a few lines Albert Finney Peter Riegert.The strength of the film is that it lets you work it out yourself.  It never goes one way or the other on the drugs issue and leaves you to decide for yourself what should happen.  This is rare in an issue' film and it should be commended.  The film allows long silences for us to think but yet is never boring or dull.Overall this is a really good film.  It is shorter and more polished than the miniseries it came from but it is very intelligently done and is thoughprovoking.  Anyone who thinks they are sure of their stance on drugs should watch this  no matter what you think this will highlight the fact that it is a complex problem to which there is no simple solution. Excellent.".

Benicio Del Toro got an Oscar for his role but I don't know why. He wasn't anything that special. Personally I liked Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman in here better with the latter adding some muchneeded humor to the film. Miguel Ferrer was also intense as the bad guy Eduardo Ruiz. The two kids who played Douglas's daughter and her boyfriend Erika Christensen and Topher Grace respectively received no billing on the back on the DVD but they had major roles. They must have done a good job because they really irritated me. Man I wanted to slap those annoying punks! The girl's descent into drug hell was not pleasant to view. This is not an easy story to watch or comprehend everything that's going on. It also is not one with a happy message.On the plus side the visuals were great with many allsepia toned scenes or all blue. Scenes changed every two minutes to a different ongoing. You had to really pay attention but I never found myself drifting away from the story. It isn't just the unique visuals it's an interesting and disturbing story.".

Most people seem to think this film is great. The reason I don't is because I've just seen the European version of Traffic a TV movie made a year earlier and it is SO much better. It's impossible not to make comparisons. Michael Douglas is excellent as always in the lead character and so was Peter Reigert wasted in a small role but that's about it. If only Catherine ZetaJones' talent could match her ambition. Her WelshSouth American accent is laughable. The worst aspect of this film is the superficial Disneyesque way it deals with Douglas' daughter's drugtaking. It's a joke. We don't see anything nasty and at the end she simply comes back to Daddy and gives up drugs. The Euro version really does show the filth and the squalor and the utter despair of a junkie as the young Oxford student drops out and descends into a life of thievery and prostitution to feed her habit. SO much more convincing. I'm annoyed by this movie because it was made later than the European version and had a much higher budget so it should have been better and it simply isn't.".

The combination of brutal honesty teenage speeches Beltway hypocrisy the futility of the current U.S. Government direction the hope brought on by living one day at a time make this the best picture to ask the question what can we do about the culture of drug abuse in the U.S.?

Writing liberties are taken once going too far but the point is that you have to push boundaries in these discussions. The combination of brutal honesty teenage speeches Beltway hypocrisy the futility of the current U.S. Government direction the hope brought on by living one day at a time make this the best picture to ask the question what can we do about the culture of drug abuse in the U.S.? The acting is spot on and the cinematography frames each character coloring them appropriately.";

	schema:reviewBody "Traffic written by Simon Moore the writer for the British miniseries Traffik upon which this script is based is superbly crafted and woven. We learn just enough about each character to give us some insight into their motives for the courses they choose to follow. By the films end matters are not neatly wrapped up there is not a fairy tale ending. This simply adds to the realism of the issues presented within the movie. Furthermore the intertwining stories drive home the fact that drugs are closer to you than you think.The script is bolstered by the phenomenal ensemble cast. ZetaJones and Del Toro have both received Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Actor in a drama for their roles in this film. Don Cheadle is superb in his role. Michael Douglas gives his usual performance while Erika Christensen does a good job as his daughter. Topher Grace of TV's That 70's Show is excellent as her upperclass druggie boyfriend. Dennis Quid's character while played adequately is underused.The stories were shot using various filters and lenses neatly separating them as the film went from one to another and adding to the viewing pleasure of the movie. Mexico is filmed through a hand held camera and yellow lens to give it a dry grainy shaky look that heightens the feel of unrest involved with Del Toro's situation. Douglas' story is initially filmed in a hue of solemn comforting blue. ZetaJones' story is filmed without the use of lenses suggesting that her situation and actions are the most realistic and achievable of all those presented.Despite some dialogue that spouts off statistics and seems a bit preachy Traffic ranks among the top ten films of 2000 surpassing even Soderbergh's other venture Erin Brokovich. Don't be surprised if this film picks up the Oscar for Best Picture.By film's end the message is clear and powerful. The fight against drugs is a long uphill battle but it is better than no battle at all.".

However Benicio Del Toro definitely stands out with the breakthrough performance. I don't think it's accidental that the movie begins and ends with shots of him. He plays Javier Rodriguez a Mexican police officer caught in a futile and corrupt system and it's as compelling of a character as Michael Corleone. Del Toro is exceptionally relaxed and subtle keeping his thoughts and feelings private from the other characters in the films but sharing it with the camera. Del Toro navigates the audience through a world of impossible choices and moral corruption quietly simmering with intense conflict just beneath the surface. Benicio's been an indie stalwart for years but this film should shoot his stock through the roof. If there's justice in this world he'll be rewarded with Best Actor Awards aplenty.Michael Douglas is also terrific adding another strong performance to his gallery of flawed men in power. He shows genuine fear and vulnerability in a harrowing scene in which he searches for his daughter in a drug dealer's den. I've never seen Erika Christensen before but she makes an impressive debut. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman they should star as a team in every movie! are as loose limber and spontaneous as ever providing plenty of comic relief as well as keeping it real. Catherine ZetaJones takes a complete 180 from her past roles and admirably plays against her looks appearing very pregnant while thrown into gritty surroundings. Dennis Quaid is appropriately slimy as a corrupt lawyer.Anyway film geeks and anybody else starved for a genuine piece of filmmaking should breathe a sigh of relief and give thanks that Soderbergh has come to save the day.".

By that I mean all the storyline points have maximum effect due to the quality of acting music and cinematography. Great use of Brian Eno's music and effective use of colour filtering to convey mood.

Whilst my comments about visuals and style still stand less credit should go to Soderbergh. I'm still a big fan of his but the scope and variety of plot lines and characters come directly from the miniseries.In conclusion the film is the series compressed and stylised into a nice bitesized Hollywood chunk.

	schema:reviewBody "Here's a film which looks amazing but lacks substance. That is quite odd considering the fact that this is a film which wants to be deep and carefully tries to avoid clichd Hollywood storytelling. Of course thanks to Crash and Inarritu's films the 'interlocking drama' has now become a clich and perhaps looking at this film seven years later after seeing all the films it has influenced lends it a disadvantage. Traffic tells three stories one of a politician in the US who is hired to head the war on drugs and has a drug addicted daughter one of a trophy wife who attempts to save her jailed husband's drug business and one of a corrupt Mexican cop who struggles with his conscience after discovering that his boss may not be the ardent antidrug official he thought he was.The problem with Traffic is that it is played 100 safe. It does not take risks. In the 90's Soderbergh made challenging and articulate films in a wide variety of styles and they were all far better than this one. When making Traffic Soderbergh made a crucial mistake with the casting. Two of the blandest and least interesting actors in Hollywood are featured here and in prominent and dramatically important roles Michael Douglas and Catherine ZetaJones. Their performances here are awful in the sense that they are firmly average and lacking in any flair. ZetaJones is incapable of any emotion in any performance I've seen her in. Here she is asked to play a complex and fairly interesting yet poorly developed character and she goes through the entire film without one moment of acting which isn't wooden. I have long ago decided that Michael Douglas plays every role the same. He just isn't convincing here at all. Too bad he didn't inherit any of his father's talent. It was absolutely crucial that this film be well acted but these two actors are detrimental to its success. It feels phony. At least the dependable Benicio Del Toro nearly saves the film with his powerhouse performance. The main issue I have with Traffic however isn't even the acting it's the screenplay. An Oscar winning screenplay nonetheless. I don't think it resolves its various stories well enough and I don't think just about ANY of the dialog was interesting. It's too worried about being politically correct and about addressing the issue at hand to bother being a good screenplay. Traffic is Oscar bait. A safe drama which hammers its point home over and over... and over. There's a shot nearly at the end of the film which pretty much summarizes everything that's wrong with this. Don Cheadle's character plants a bug underneath a table in a house something we see clearly. A few seconds later we see the bug AGAIN. This film assumes that its audience is less than intelligent. All that said Traffic is a visually good film. The production design crucial to telling stories in several vastly different locations is excellent. The photography is excellent and innovative use of different lenses adds atmosphere to the film. The camera is always in the right place at the right time capturing events perfectly without being too distracting. The score compliments the film very well. This film is wellmade but it is empty. It manages in nearly three hours to say nothing and offend nobody. It's good technical filmmaking but other than that offers nothing. It wants to be a big statement on drugs and drug policies but it fails miserably. It's not even the best movie made about drugs in its year. Looking into the 90's we find Danny Boyle's masterpiece Trainspotting. The 80's? Well there was a terrific British miniseries on Masterpiece Theatre called Traffik which was the inspiration for this film but far stronger in a narrative and dramatic sense. 2.55".

This new style of filming that seems to integrate a choppy video feel and seems a bit out of focus is also irritating to me. Maybe I am just not with the times but I DID like American Beauty so I can't be THAT out of touch. To me it was a pure exercise in painful boredom watching middle class kids pretend to be part of the drug culture. Truly a waste of time and a truly unrealistic portrayal of drug culture.";

The director sought to make this stand out from the first film and he succeeded. This has fantastic action great dialogue and some hilarious dark humor. But most of all its intelligent its extremely well made it's not plagued with any awkward or out of place moments. For some viewers this film might actually be a learning experience. If you want to see an action film that isn't 90 action and 10 plot. If you want something that's hardcore fearless and has a message this is it. Check it out you won't be disappointed.".

Forget about all of that... this movie has nothing of the sort. Of course there is a lot of shootings and some torture scenes but they are nothing compared to the ones in the first movie they are quick and do not show as much! But do not let this keep you from watching this movie. In fact what makes this sequel so special is that it doesn't even feel like a sequel it feels more like a SAGA Capito Nascimento's SAGA his quest for justice and against crime. Its a deeper voyage into Nascimento's feelings and also into the inner workings of the CRIME machine. Its a more mature and better developed movie which will make you think. It will make you angry and it will make you mad... but in the end it will make you want to cry out loud GO CAPITO NASCIMENTOOOOOOO!!! And cheer for him!".

It would've been much more raw and realistic for there to have been a different outcome for Nascimento but I can only imagine the gaping wound this would have left in its viewers for at that point I was already filled with despair but was granted the chance to remount my defenses to a more comfortable degree. I loved this film it's right up there with the first and I have to say that the main character is on the fast track to becoming a Brazilian cultural icon more so than he already was the ruthlessly destructive force that people have been left with no choice but to mirror themselves on.".

	schema:reviewBody "More than eleven million viewers paid tickets to watch Elite Squad 2 at the theatres surpassing the record established by Avatar as the most successful movie in the history of Brazil and showing that a good screenplay a good cast good production values and thoughtprovoking topics still matter more than all the progresses in special effects. The first movie was a cultural phenomenon in Brazil expectations were high and sequels usually disappoint. But this sequel not only lives up to the first movie  it transcends it. What we have here is a smarter movie that exchanges the favelas the drug trafficridden slums for luxurious public offices. The enemy is someone else this time not the petty street dealers but the whole corrupt system that extends itself to cops politicians and the media. Those expecting an exciting action movie like the first one will get less but nonetheless excellent action sequences of the BOPE in action but more story dealing with the socialpolitical reality of Brazil.The movie starts thirteen years after the events of the first movie. During a prison riot the BOPE is called in to intervene. Although they secure the prison the strike team causes a public relations incident when Captain Matias Andr Ramiro coldbloodedly shoots an inmate ready to surrender in front of Fraga Irandhir Santos a human rights activist negotiating peace with the inmates. The first choice of a patsy is Colonel Nascimento Wagner Moura but public opinion loves him and instead of falling down as he puts it he falls up. He's sent to the Public Safety Department basically the secret services. In his new role he makes the BOPE more efficient and modern. He launches a war on drug lords thinking that with profits shrinking the criminals will just disappear. Instead he creates a new type of criminal. Corrupt cops involved in the drug money eliminate the middlemen and set up a racketeering system forcing the slum dwellers to pay for protection. These militias apparently working for the common good become a powerful force since they can buy votes and influence elections. Politicians and militias tighten their relationships behind Nascimento's back who continues to think his methods are working.Elite Squad 2 works because it grows from the first one. The first movie introduced BOPE to the world and had to spend time explaining its methods philosophy code of honour and recruitment process. The sequel doesn't suffer from the burden of exposition and instead of rehashing the plot of the first  the bane of most sequels  it lets the characters' personalities lead the story.Many old faces come back from major ones like Matias and Nascimento to smaller ones like LieutenantColonel Fbio Milhem Cortaz the corrupt recruit who failed to join the BOPE in the first movie and Major Rocha Sandro Rocha a mere face in the first but here the villain who masterminds the racketeering program to take control of the favelas. Matias and Nascimento's relationship becomes strained after Matias is kicked out of the BOPE following the prison incident. From the new characters mostly politicians the most important is the leftwing activist Fraga who uses the prison incident to run for Deputy.Brazilian cinema has been very good since City of God exploded in the world like a hand grenade. Because of it Brazilian cinema has become synonymous with crime movies even if that's a gross generalization. A subgenre of crime movies defined by graphic violence social criticism and inventive camera work has prospered in its wake My Name Ain't Johnny The Man Who Copied City of Men Bus 174 and the Elite Squad movies. At the heart of this Renaissance is the movie's screenwriter Brulio Mantovani. For better or for worse all these movies take inspiration from the style he established in City of God. Directors and actors come and go but everyone still copies the dark humour the political irreverence the nonlinear narratives and the clever voiceover that earned Mantovani an Oscar nomination almost a decade ago.Editor Daniel Rezende who also worked in City of God puts the movie together with the force of a tornado. Complementing director of photography Lula Carvalho's documentarylike style the fast editing and the dizzying camera work go as far as cinema outside of 3D can go in immersing the viewer in the middle of the action.Most people who watch Wagner Moura here probably don't know that in Brazil he's primarily known for playing romantic lead roles in soap operas. In the first movie Moura revealed a surprising talent for fierceness and coldbloodedness in the new movie his transformation continues. In the first movie the actor underwent physical training in the second his change is emotional. In the first movie Nascimento was looking for a replacement in the second he starts questioning his role in the system. Moura portrays a more vulnerable character and his performance has grown richer in subtlety.Of those from the original cast Andr Ramiro has the shortest screen time. The first movie showed his slow transformation into a noble policeman into a ruthless killing machine ending with his bloody rite of initiation. The plot in the sequel goes in a direction that doesn't give him much to do which is a pity because Ramiro's character was the most interesting after Moura's. But he has the privilege of stealing the few scenes he's in with his angry performance.Elite Squad 2 is an upsetting movie. The first movie offered the easy solutions of a police state whereas the second shows their ineffectiveness unless change occurs in the whole system from top to bottom and not just in the favelas. The first movie was a fun action ride that ended on a satisfying note with justice served. In the second the viewer will come out feeling as indignant as if unjustly battered by a police truncheon unable to forget it for a long time.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Elite Squad 2";
	schema:reviewBody "I was hoping that Elite Squad 2 would get a commercial screening in Singapore but if not then it made a welcome appearance during this year's SIFF and while it can be watched as a standalone film you'll appreciate the challenges faced by the principal characters a lot more if you've watched the original where BOPE leader Nascimento Wagner Moura and his squad got introduced with the primary plot revolving around his tough training of two up and coming protgs in the squad which had powers to eliminate enemies of the drug trade with deadly force. It became one of my favourite shows that year and of its genre and I'm glad that the sequel went one up without repeating itself tackling problems in Rio De Janeiro that are of a wider scale exploring just how deep the rabbit hole of corruption in the city goes.Starting with a cliffhanger where Nascimento now Lt Colonel with added years to his age with a hint of grey at the sides of his head got caught up between a rock and a hard place we then journey some months back which writerdirector Jose Padilha returning for this film outdid himself with tightly choreographed intensely shot action sequences within a high security prison where inmates took over with force and are out to eradicate enemies within the prison where enclaves sprung up. You'll notice that the shaky cam cinematography in its predecessor got toned down a lot in this follow up film which is nice. From that botched attempt of now Captain Andre Matias Andre Ramiro disobeying orders from the top but with public sentiments on a high for the nononsense approach by the BOPE Nascimento got moved out of the Skulls and into politics becoming undersecretary of Intelligence in charge of all wiretapping activities by the authorities while Andre himself got moved back to becoming a lowly beat cop.It's a very major departure from the premise of the first film if you've come with expectations that you'll get to see action sequence after action sequence punctuated by violence because this installment is a more cerebral take on the problems plaguing the city and a more macrolevel approach as well involving crooked politicians and their support system beneath them that fuels a very symbiotic relationship between the corrupt leaders and their underlings moving away from drug cartels to wider and ruthlessly effective organized crime involving what some say are the largest gangsters around the police force in far more lucrative illegal trade fueled by the slums they're supposed to protect. And these problems go to show that if a system is corrupt it'll take some humongous effort to clean it up if one can find a foothold to begin from that is which is what Elite Squad 2 is mostly about the few and rare good men who are willing to step out and stand up to be counted even though they're battling on different fronts and may not share the same belief system.Jose Padilha balanced political intrigue crime and action without forgetting the emotional core that had also levelset the first film. Nascimento's son is all grown up now but remains estranged from his dad because he cannot comprehend why Nascimento had to kill in his line of duty. And as if that's not enough his wife is now romantically linked with his professional nemesis Fraga Irandir Santos who with his nongovernment organization championing human rights becomes the thorn in his side for frequently undermining BOPE's tactics and strategy that you would have seen from the first film and in a way something like how director Padilha seeks to address detractors of that film. Things also get patchy between mentor and mentee especially when Andre sees Nascimento being unable to reinstate his position back in BOFE but others working through a network of connections are able to which sort of brings forth a moral dilemma of being beholden to someone especially when links to the mob comes into play.Wagner Moura keeps up his charismatic performance as the one man tour de force with a riveting performance as a leader anyone will want to follow with courage and sometimes obsessed conviction in being married to his job and taking it upon himself as the city's saviour and scourge of the city's criminals even if they happen to be white collared and in positions of power. Granted you'll miss watching him in action leading his men on raids as he becomes assigned to a desk job but there's no lack of intensity in his newly minted career path seeing it as opportunity to resource load his old unit to do a lot more than he imagined though indirectly responsible for slicing off the head of a hydra he had yet to fully understand.While action sequences are limited there is no lack of excitement and edge of your seat moments where everything kicks into high gear best played out in a hall with a properly tuned sound system that puts you in the thick of all the action. One can only hope for a follow up film if there's another strong story to be told given that loose ends still exist the problems in the real world never actually going away and the system is one big monster that is constantly evolving and evading eradication which will probably take generations to effect real change but for action junkies and fans of police films having Nascimento back for another film will indeed be a welcome treat. I can actually listen to an audio book narrated by Wagner Moura and not get bored at all since it is his narration that fills in the blanks in this film and moves it forward. Highly recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "I was hoping that Elite Squad 2 would get a commercial screening in Singapore but if not then it made a welcome appearance during this year's SIFF and while it can be watched as a standalone film you'll appreciate the challenges faced by the principal characters a lot more if you've watched the original where BOPE leader Nascimento Wagner Moura and his squad got introduced with the primary plot revolving around his tough training of two up and coming protgs in the squad which had powers to eliminate enemies of the drug trade with deadly force. It became one of my favourite shows that year and of its genre and I'm glad that the sequel went one up without repeating itself tackling problems in Rio De Janeiro that are of a wider scale exploring just how deep the rabbit hole of corruption in the city goes.Starting with a cliffhanger where Nascimento now Lt Colonel with added years to his age with a hint of grey at the sides of his head got caught up between a rock and a hard place we then journey some months back which writerdirector Jose Padilha returning for this film outdid himself with tightly choreographed intensely shot action sequences within a high security prison where inmates took over with force and are out to eradicate enemies within the prison where enclaves sprung up. You'll notice that the shaky cam cinematography in its predecessor got toned down a lot in this follow up film which is nice. From that botched attempt of now Captain Andre Matias Andre Ramiro disobeying orders from the top but with public sentiments on a high for the nononsense approach by the BOPE Nascimento got moved out of the Skulls and into politics becoming undersecretary of Intelligence in charge of all wiretapping activities by the authorities while Andre himself got moved back to becoming a lowly beat cop.It's a very major departure from the premise of the first film if you've come with expectations that you'll get to see action sequence after action sequence punctuated by violence because this installment is a more cerebral take on the problems plaguing the city and a more macrolevel approach as well involving crooked politicians and their support system beneath them that fuels a very symbiotic relationship between the corrupt leaders and their underlings moving away from drug cartels to wider and ruthlessly effective organized crime involving what some say are the largest gangsters around the police force in far more lucrative illegal trade fueled by the slums they're supposed to protect. And these problems go to show that if a system is corrupt it'll take some humongous effort to clean it up if one can find a foothold to begin from that is which is what Elite Squad 2 is mostly about the few and rare good men who are willing to step out and stand up to be counted even though they're battling on different fronts and may not share the same belief system.Jose Padilha balanced political intrigue crime and action without forgetting the emotional core that had also levelset the first film.

He then tells us how he got to that point. At the end we return to that point and find out what happens during the shootout and its aftermath.We learn of a raid to a prison that houses all the major drug dealers who continue their dealings inside jail. There is an orchestrated mutiny and most drug dealers are killed. A human rights advocate and professor rushes to the jail to mediate. But there's little he can do. The massacre causes a political uproar. And politicians seek to distance themselves from the violent elite squad BOPE. That is until they realize how popular a tough stance against crime is with the people. So Nascimento gets a political promotion he's now placed in charge of intelligence. A smart move by the politicians. They promote him while getting him out of the picture.With the main drug dealers out of the way someone has to fill the power vacuum in the slums and keep order. Corrupt policemen realize how much money there is to be made in that position. Basically they get their share of every deal that is done on the streets whether it's a drug deal or a pirate cable TV installation. Then they assault a precinct to steal all the weapons. The corrupt governor who is running for reelection an associate and a TV commentator plan then to organize a massive attack on the slums to recover the weapons which according their media campaign were stolen by regular criminals and hidden in the slums.Nascimento's intelligence knows very well that the drug dealers don't have any weapons. He tries to argue against the operation but the politicians won't hear any of it. The operation fails to find weapons. This should sound familiar. Nascimento quips that it should have been called Operation Iraq. When his friend Matias becomes a victim of the machine Nascimento decides to confront the corruption head on. He gets the unwilling help of a reporter working with the human rights activist who is now a senator. He's also married to Nascimento exwife. Nascimento's son lives with them.With all that we return to the shootout in the present day.The success of this movie is the smart mixture of political intrigue and corruption with high octane action. For some reason I was hoping for more action as this director really excels at shooting those scenes. The portrayal of the political mafia as a bunch of vain fools is accurate and funny. The middle portion of this movie is somewhat flat I didn't connect with it but that could have been because of the subtitles that race across the screen and don't allow you to focus on the movie itself.The bigger problem are all the forced coincidences that are so convenient for the writers to include. The exwife happens to marry the human rights senator. He son happens to hear when the reporter tells the senator that she thinks the police stole the weapons and so on.Despite some minor flaws this series is still outstanding and almost epic.".

After a prison riot today Nascimento Wagner Moura  this character was based on screenwriter Rodrigo Pimentel is a high ranking security officer in Rio De Janeiro  he is swept into a bloody political dispute that involves government officials  politicians and paramilitary groups . Excellent and nailbeating film based on real events  in fact  the role of Diogo Fraga Irandhir Santos is based on the real life Rio de Janeiro State Representative Marcelo Freixo . Nowadays  high commander Nascimento has to find out a lot of problems while trying to take down inmates from a prison riot  drug dealers  criminals and a corrupt police called Rocha who commands a dangerous militia . On the streets of Rio only the elite survive . The movie also deals about BOPE  a Special Operations Squad similar to American SWAT and their fight against factions in Favelas Rio Janeiro . Meanwhile  Matias Andre Ramiro  this role was based on screenwriter Andr Batista  former members of the BOPE squad is moved to the corrupted Military Police .This stirring film has breathless  brutal scenes  a gut punch of an action film . It concerns on an upright man  his fight against policy corruption  taking on the daily challenges of dealing with pressure at home and fighting an unnamed war on Rio Janeiro slums . Interesting and brooding screenplay from the Academy Award nominated writer of City of God . Many critics have considered as a tremendous movie  on the level of some of the Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola pictures . A must see a cross between the Departed  The Wire and City of God . It's a thoughtprovoking and clever studio of a few decent people  an Elite Squad  about police corruption  and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro  plenty of druglords  burglars and assassins . Runtime film is overlong but it's fast moving and for that reason isn't boring but it's entertaining . The picture grossed at box office  it had a total public of 2.4 million paying viewers while playing in theaters in Brazil  in addition to the estimated 11 million who watched the bootleg copies and got a final version slightly different from the pirated one . It made the most seen movie in Brazilian cinema history. It also became the highestgrossing film of all time in Brazil beating Avatar 2009's record . In fact  this film was already a bestseller almost three months before its official release . Illegal copies of what the director called the 3rd cut flooded the streets of all major capitals in Brazil for the equivalent of five dollars a piece . The characters are based on actual people  as Andre Matias was a member of BOPE and was a honest man who finds himself torn between his life as a BOPE member and his life long dreams of being a lawyer . Exciting as well as moving musical score . Composer Pedro Bromfman is the man behind Padilha's critically acclaimed sensation Elite Squad and the smash hit sequel and he's reteamed with the filmmaker for RoboCop .Direction by Jose Padilha is awesome  stylish  and overuse Steadycam  this is an awardwinning Brazilian picture  it was Brazil's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category of the 84th Academy Awards 2012 . Filmmaker Jose directed first Elite Squad about a Special Police Battalion  called BOPE  an unit of urban combat attempting to take down drug dealers and killers in Rio De Janeiro before the Pope comes to Rio  and this sequel  the smash hit followup  Elite Squad The Enemy Within both of them have been monster hits in his native Brazil and beyond . Director Jos Padilha claimed that this movie ends his trilogy about urban violence in major Brazilian cities . The first one nibus 174 2002 was a documentary meant to explain how the state's indifference towards poor people can lead to the formation of violent criminals . The second Elite Squad 2007 meant to explain how the state's indifference towards law enforcement agencies will often result in police brutality and corrupt officers . And finally the last movie deals with the reasons behind the state's choice to ignore the poor and the police . These films had a lot of box office  about 11.1 million paying viewers made it the most seen movies in Brazilian cinema history . The first feature film in English for this director resulted to be RoboCop  making his Hollywood debut  and inventively breaks down reconfigures and soups up the core halfman halfmachine cophero conceit.".

The corruption in Brazil is a mirror of the same kind of political corruption in America our electoral college is a joke our candidate propaganda machine is a joke our Congress is a joke and our Senate is a joke.Recent uprisings from the average Joe and Jane assuming they make it to the news outside of the U.S. is indication enough that not everything is strawberries and lilies in the land of the U.

And seeing a movie like Elite Squad 2 helps put that into perspective this isn't just my nation that's like this it's a lot of nations that are like this.So yeah this movie made me angry because it makes you feel helpless and small and insignificant with its powder kegs of truth. You see how violence can suffocate change and cronyism can hamper the democratic process. This movie outlines that even when you think the good guys can win they don't. It's a harsh dose of reality served up in the most intense two hours you'll experience from a movie for a long time to come.Despite the feeling of helplessness and anger toward the reality of our corrupt and pathetic political systems more than anything this movie makes you want to stand up and say enough is enough!".

You see how violence can suffocate change and cronyism can hamper the democratic process. This movie outlines that even when you think the good guys can win they don't. It's a harsh dose of reality served up in the most intense two hours you'll experience from a movie for a long time to come.Despite the feeling of helplessness and anger toward the reality of our corrupt and pathetic political systems more than anything this movie makes you want to stand up and say enough is enough!";

Reading about theft rape or murder in your morning newspaper doesn't trouble you. Why would it? This is your reality odds are you have witnessed such things first hand. Best to accept facts. People die especially in Rio de Janerio.This movie brings up the evil that exists in our society. There is always someone ready to walk over corpses so that themselves can move up in the world. It's easier if you don't see yourself as a bad guy. You rationalize it or let someone else get the job done. I wonder how some people can sleep at night...It was a while since I saw the first movie. You almost immediately recognize The Enemy Within as an epic sequel. Expect to be sitting on needles throughout the movie only to register your mind is blown once it's over. This is fcked up I heard myself saying. The credits starts rolling. I pause and ponder.This is the situation most over the world! Politicians and business giants loosing track of their ideals to get more money more power. Why? Maybe being of significance not being another dust speck in a desert is why. But you knew about greedy men before Tropa de Elite 2 so why did this movie touch you the way other media did not? I'd say this movie showed us more layers more perspective than before. I wished a character who was normal with it's opinions and thoughts about life in Rio was missed. Guess I can always go there and ask someone myself.This movie is officially my new favorite drugslum movie knocking down City of God to a second place and I doubt it will ever be placed third.I want to ask you a question.

The movie is very intense in that all the scenes are very well connected and well balanced between narration and action. There is much less action and violence than the first one but it is compensated by the well written script which keeps audience on the edge of the seat as the whole storyline unfolds.I felt like I have grown with the protagonist from the first movie. As his fight has gone from tactical to strategical the perspective of the movie has graduated to higher more holistic level. Though fictional the movie tells a story that many different countries share a society hijacked by systematic corruption social inequality and gang violence. As credit rolls I found myself sitting in silence pondering my role in this ecology how we have come to this and more importantly how we can extricate ourselves from this situation. I believe this is precisely what the director wanted us to think.The acting and soundtracks are up to the standards in my opinion and the action scenes are much closer to reality than most Hollywood movies. Unfortunately no movie is perfect in my opinion the characters are not very well developed. It is a movie dedicated to a political message and I respect the decision of the director to make it so. However that means lengthy narration outlining the structure of the corrupted system took priority over develop connection between the audience and the characters. I personally would prefer using more acting interactions and development of the plot itself as oppose to plain verbal narration.Nonetheless it is a great movie and I would definitely recommend it to those who are interested in political and social topics.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite possible coincidences with the reality this movie is a work of fiction. This is a disclaimer at the beginning of Tropa de Elite 2  O Inimigo Agora  Outro Elite Squad The Enemy Within a sequel to the fantastic Tropa de Elite. It also constitutes the first difference between the movies. While most of the crew stayed the same including director Padilha screenwriter Mantovani and former BOPE member Pimentel they didn't film real life inspired events like in the first movie. Although one can easily assume what the sequel depicts isn't far from the reality. The other difference is that in Tropa de Elite 2 the focus moves from the BOPE unit to the politics.Roberto Nascimento returns as a narrator of the story which is this time more centered on him only now he has a different rank. He became Lt. Colonel and got in charge of whole of BOPE. But that doesn't last for long. Soon he's made Deputy Secretary of Intelligence in the state of Rio de Janeiro and changes BOPE uniform for a suit and tie. Nascimento decides to use his new position to make BOPE stronger and eradicate drug trafficking from the favelas. It takes him some time to realize it isn't him who's using the system but the other way around. Several other characters reappear such as Andr Matias who became a Captain Fbio a dirty police Captain who got to the position of Lt. Colonel or Rocha another dirty cop who's taken over favelas. There are also some new characters representing the world of politics such as Governor of the state Gelino Secretary of Intelligence Guaracy and Diogo Fraga leftoriented State Representative who's married to Nascimento's exwife. The problem is that this time all of the characters are simplified. Each one has its views and no one revisits them except Nascimento. That's why he's such a great character. Going through different situations he learns and evolves and he's ready to change his opinions in light of new information.Moving the focus of the story to politics the movie got more diverse but also lost its punch. While Padilha combines various office meetings and street murders the best he can the combination of the two just can't repeat the impact of the first movie. What doesn't help is that he already showed us the police is corrupt and corruption of the politicians is a thing I believe well known amongst the people all over the world because it's present in probably every country. Maybe it's not as extreme as shown here but it doesn't surprise to see some of them are willing to go one step further.So the movie shows us things we already know but does it in a very good way. Most of the elements like Padilha's direction Lula Carvalho's cinematography Daniel Rezende's editing and especially the acting by Wagner Moura Irandhir Santos Sandro Rocha and others are as good as in the previous film. One thing that I found a little underwhelming is screenplay. Not that it's bad but some of the characters seem inconsistent and everything is a bit overexplained.That is also the main problem of this movie. Everything that was subtextual in the first one is now explicitly shown and while in the first one you had to think and make your own conclusions here it's mostly done for you. Tropa de Elite 2 plays on emotions more than reason and does it skillfully. It just doesn't benefit from its detailed account as much as the first one did from its rawness.More reviews at httponlineimpressions.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " A personal favorite and semioverlooked classic";
	schema:reviewBody "A standout WWII drama loosely based on a true story.  In 1944 as the Allies spread across France from the Normandy landings the Nazis looted Paris art museums and loaded the works onto a train with the intention of carrying them back to the Fatherland and selling or bartering them for scarce war materials.  A fairly harebrained scheme to be sure and in reality the train never made it further than a siding just east of the city but that shouldn't hinder one's enjoyment of what turns out to be a classic action film.The centerpiece of the movie is a clash of wills between Von Waldheim a cultured but ironbacked Nazi colonel wellplayed by Paul Scofield charged with getting the stolen artworks to Germany and a taciturn railway troubleshooter named Labiche Burt Lancaster.  Von Waldheim first enlists Labiche as 'insurance' against any monkey business during the train's journey.  Labiche though happens to have Resistance connections and with serious reservations is drawn into a desperate improvised plot to stop the train preferably without damaging the precious artifacts inside.Although easily enjoyed as a straight action flick what gives the film weight is the supporting story in which Labiche at first argues against wasting precious lives on a few crates of paintings he's never seen then gradually comes round as he begins to understand that the Nazis are effectively carrying off a large piece of the heart of France. Beautiful deepfocus black and white photography and solid supporting performances by a mostly French cast of which Jeanne Moreau may be the bestknown convincingly evoke the bleak misery of the Occupation.  John Frankenheimer's economical direction manages to present highlycharged action scenes without glossing over the human cost as Von Waldheim exacts savage reprisals against escalating efforts to hinder the train's passage.Lancaster who performed his own stunts is excellent furiously athletic as he slides down ladders leaps onto moving locomotives and charges over ridges and fields in pursuit of the train.  At the same time he manages to effectively bring a subtle authenticity to his portrayal of the weary fatalistic railwayman.Finally the action setpieces are nothing short of stunning and include the train's mad dash through an Allied carpetbombing attack a strafing raid on a speeding locomotive and several wrecks and derailments all staged fullscale with period equipment donated by the French national railway.  Well worth obtaining on DVD the film may be hard to find on broadcast television these days.".

	schema:headline " NailBiting Frankenheimer Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Absolutely riveting thriller an AmericanFrench coproduction with a great cast wellwritten plot and script  and great stuntwork. As with all of John Frankenheimer's work it's an instantly classic masterpiece.Burt Lancaster is Labiche a French station manager who becomes entangled in efforts to prevent German Colonel Von Waldheim Scofield from shipping hundreds of classic pieces of artwork out of Paris before the Allies retake the city. John Frankenheimer has done an excellent job putting every aspect of great storytelling together. The most essential part is the characters. Lancaster is absolutely great as Labiche. While the French want him to simply delay the train Labiche is always more concerned about the human cost. Eventually so many men are killed in the attempt to delay the train that he takes it upon himself to save the artwork so they did not die in vain. On the opposite side Scofield makes a very believable maniacal officer. He is purely obsessed by art. He's not your typical Hollywood Nazi officer here his one goal is not eradication of the Jews or whatnot  it's to steal millions of dollars worth of paintings for personal gain.The French are played for the most part by young native French actors. Michel Simon plays a grizzled old engineer who tries to take matters into his own hands at first when Labiche won't aide the cause. Albert Remy IS PARIS BURNING? and Charles Millot THE BATTLE OF NERETVA are Labiche's resistance sidekicks both passionate in their rather minor roles. Jeanne Moreau THE VICTORS makes a pretty big impression as a hotel owner who gets caught up the fight and elects to help Labiche even though it will hurt her business and put her life in danger. In support the cast is made up of some very fine young actors who would become mainstream faces in later European war movies. Wolfgang Preiss THE LONGEST DAY makes an impression as the German Major commanding a rail yard who is just simply trying to keep his facility running well and doesn't want to deal with Von Waldheim. The great Richard Munch PATTON has one strong scene as a German general who knows the front line battle is more important than Von Waldheim's art. Howard Vernon FROM HELL TO VICTORY is the German captain with glasses in charge of the train Donald O'Brien DEADLY MISSION is a very meanlooking Sergeant keeping Lancaster and Remy in check and Arthur Brauss plays the German Captain interrogating the stationmaster.The second essential portion of the story goes to the purely technical side of the production. First of all there are some truly spectacular action sequences. Most of them were done with real locomotives on lifesize sets with authentic explosions. One huge threeway headoncollision is awestriking and must have marvelous to see on the big screen. Lancaster performs all of his own stunts jumping from control towers running and catching moving trains  all one would think would be difficult for a man of 51  but Lancaster doesn't show a bit of strain. A good deal of the action centers around simply moving trains and equipment through railyards and it's all portrayed with acute attention to authenticity and detail.At key moments Frankenheimer uses his typical unorthodox filming technique to give the action a new perspective. The camera zooms in on every day objects which actually have key importance at that one moment. He follows Labiche down a hallway with a handheld camera simply because it's the best way of showing how he gets to where he's going. All of this is trademark Frankenheimer direction and it gives the film a sharp cutting edge to its already awesome plot. Sincerely standard direction with all of the same elements would really lessen the impact of the punch every other element packs. A few side notes the scenery is great each town village set piece actual location or open countryside looks just like 1944 France. Maurice Jarre's rousing music score is great and is quickly becoming one of my favorite war movie themes ranking with the works of Jerry Goldsmith Ennio Morricone Elmer Bernstein and John Williams. I saw this movie on Turner Classic Movies letterboxed about 1.661. This is apparently a transfer directly from the DVD. The print is excellent the black and white image is sharp the sound is clear and appropriately loud and there is hardly a scratch or speckle to be seen. The DVD is probably worth buying for the commentary track it holds but I have not yet viewed the disc. THE TRAIN is an instant classic from the Golden Age of cinema with every element working perfectly.RATING 1010".

	schema:headline " Masterful Action Drama from Frankenheimer";
	schema:reviewBody "For me the concept of an 'action' film is the most curious as many examples of the genre seem very static to me  even today where it seems that anything can be shown on screen. A fight car crash explosion etc is rehearsed staged simultaneously photographed and edited in a certain way that brings out and sometimes enhances the action. But as the event is meticulously planned rigorously controlled and sometimes or always reshot spontaneity cannot be part of the action or plays a small part. The action may be impressive but it still seems unreal too chaotic or even more importantly the sense that the action is not integrated into the story and maybe even more importantly the attitude and motivation of the characters. Most action films are far from being this sophisticated.Almost everything that Burt Lancaster does or experiences in John Frankenheimer's THE TRAIN seems real necessary and interesting. He did all his own stunts in the film learned to cast driving axlebearings which we see in the film in a continuous take. Frankenheimer was one of the true masters of the audacious complicated continuous scene and this film has many astounding setpieces. The film is also one of the last great films shot in deep focus black and white mostly with a 25mm lens and it is the bold striking compositions of the intense and vigorous action that elevates the film to an even higher level. Frankenheimer never took the bland straightforward choices of blocking and positioning the camera in his films  certainly not in the first half of his career and THE TRAIN is a veritable textbook in imaginative visual directing.There is great sense of danger in the film much like the feeling that THE WAGES OF FEAR produces  and indeed in one scene we see an actual traincrash that smashed nine cameras and was only captured by one camera which yielded one of the most startling shots in all of Cinema! The whole film has sense of almost reckless daring but was carefully controlled throughout. The scene where Albert Rmy uncouples the engine from the cars is insane! I can't think of another film where a key actor does something so dangerous on their own with a stunt double.But all of these scenes and shots serve the story which is in itself fascinating. It asks the question What is more important  irreplaceable works of art or the lives of common human beings? Col. von Waldheim is an unorthodox Nazi who has a deep admiration for 'decadent' paintings and is willing to save them possess or save them at any cost  regardless of his orders. Paul Labiche knows trains inside out but a painting means as much to him as a string of pearls to an ape but his morals are infinitely more compassionate than von Waldheim which he makes clear without speech at the end  where in fact twenty minutes go by without Lancaster uttering a single word which was unheard of them of a superstar male actor but it totally appropriate. It is one of the great performances in all of waraction Cinema I feel. And his antagonist is the legendary Paul Scofield in his first screen appearance in six years who is as always magnificent. Everyone did a firstrate job on this film yet only the screenwriters were nominated for the 1966 Oscars the film was not released until May 1965 in the USA which is yet another example of Academy madness.Everything about THE TRAIN is unconventional. It was made at a time when other studios and directors would have gone for colour and CinemaScope Frankenheimer went for deepfocus black and white 1.661 went for authenticity verisimilitude  no backprojection or models. Arthur Penn actually began the film but I have never been able to ascertain how much material he shot or why he was fired but it would have been a very different movie Frankenheimer's vigorous but elegant style is so perfectly right for this film.One thing that makes some films extra special is those that have many scenes where a process is at work and is shown in detail seem more powerful. One cannot shown process in any other medium of art. Heist scenes as in THE ASPHALT JUNGLE RIFIFI LE CERCLE ROUGE etc are prime examples the escape preparations in Robert Bresson's A MAN ESCAPED and Jacques Becker's LE TROU are also enthralling and 'make' each movie what it is. The working out of a lifeordeath puzzle as in BLOWUP THE CONVERSATION and De Palma's BLOW OUT also illustrate the power of the medium. What makes these scenes  'process of action'  interesting and occasionally powerful is that they make us look at human interaction with matter is a different even deeper way. Slow motion cinematography remains one of man's greatest inventions. Before it we had no idea how fast moving objects worked or behaved. There was over 50 years of gunfire in Cinema until we saw what a bullet leaving the barrel of a gun looked like in THE OMEN 1976. It spins for one thing. That must have surprised many people.On the whole and after seeing it for the first time in about six years I firmly feel that THE TRAIN is one of the greatest action films ever made not only for its audacious crashes bold style and unobtrusive score by Maurice Jarre but also for it simply being a fascinating and unusual story this is brilliantly acted.".

The action may be impressive but it still seems unreal too chaotic or even more importantly the sense that the action is not integrated into the story and maybe even more importantly the attitude and motivation of the characters. Most action films are far from being this sophisticated.Almost everything that Burt Lancaster does or experiences in John Frankenheimer's THE TRAIN seems real necessary and interesting. He did all his own stunts in the film learned to cast driving axlebearings which we see in the film in a continuous take. Frankenheimer was one of the true masters of the audacious complicated continuous scene and this film has many astounding setpieces. The film is also one of the last great films shot in deep focus black and white mostly with a 25mm lens and it is the bold striking compositions of the intense and vigorous action that elevates the film to an even higher level. Frankenheimer never took the bland straightforward choices of blocking and positioning the camera in his films  certainly not in the first half of his career and THE TRAIN is a veritable textbook in imaginative visual directing.There is great sense of danger in the film much like the feeling that THE WAGES OF FEAR produces  and indeed in one scene we see an actual traincrash that smashed nine cameras and was only captured by one camera which yielded one of the most startling shots in all of Cinema! The whole film has sense of almost reckless daring but was carefully controlled throughout. The scene where Albert Rmy uncouples the engine from the cars is insane! I can't think of another film where a key actor does something so dangerous on their own with a stunt double.But all of these scenes and shots serve the story which is in itself fascinating. It asks the question What is more important  irreplaceable works of art or the lives of common human beings? Col. von Waldheim is an unorthodox Nazi who has a deep admiration for 'decadent' paintings and is willing to save them possess or save them at any cost  regardless of his orders. Paul Labiche knows trains inside out but a painting means as much to him as a string of pearls to an ape but his morals are infinitely more compassionate than von Waldheim which he makes clear without speech at the end  where in fact twenty minutes go by without Lancaster uttering a single word which was unheard of them of a superstar male actor but it totally appropriate. It is one of the great performances in all of waraction Cinema I feel. And his antagonist is the legendary Paul Scofield in his first screen appearance in six years who is as always magnificent. Everyone did a firstrate job on this film yet only the screenwriters were nominated for the 1966 Oscars the film was not released until May 1965 in the USA which is yet another example of Academy madness.Everything about THE TRAIN is unconventional. It was made at a time when other studios and directors would have gone for colour and CinemaScope Frankenheimer went for deepfocus black and white 1.661 went for authenticity verisimilitude  no backprojection or models. Arthur Penn actually began the film but I have never been able to ascertain how much material he shot or why he was fired but it would have been a very different movie Frankenheimer's vigorous but elegant style is so perfectly right for this film.One thing that makes some films extra special is those that have many scenes where a process is at work and is shown in detail seem more powerful. One cannot shown process in any other medium of art. Heist scenes as in THE ASPHALT JUNGLE RIFIFI LE CERCLE ROUGE etc are prime examples the escape preparations in Robert Bresson's A MAN ESCAPED and Jacques Becker's LE TROU are also enthralling and 'make' each movie what it is. The working out of a lifeordeath puzzle as in BLOWUP THE CONVERSATION and De Palma's BLOW OUT also illustrate the power of the medium. What makes these scenes  'process of action'  interesting and occasionally powerful is that they make us look at human interaction with matter is a different even deeper way. Slow motion cinematography remains one of man's greatest inventions. Before it we had no idea how fast moving objects worked or behaved. There was over 50 years of gunfire in Cinema until we saw what a bullet leaving the barrel of a gun looked like in THE OMEN 1976. It spins for one thing. That must have surprised many people.On the whole and after seeing it for the first time in about six years I firmly feel that THE TRAIN is one of the greatest action films ever made not only for its audacious crashes bold style and unobtrusive score by Maurice Jarre but also for it simply being a fascinating and unusual story this is brilliantly acted.";

	schema:headline " Catch the Train";
	schema:reviewBody "A gripping highcontrast black and white film from 1965 The Train directed by John Frankenheimer pays off in every way. Shot on location in France there is not a mundane moment in the 133minute movie.The Train has as its central conflict the combating wills of a German Officer and middle class worker and these two characters represent the battle between France and Germany during World War Two.Frankenheimer's direction and coverage of the action is stunning with deep focus night shots and airplane shots and multicamera action particularly the bombing of a train station with many locomotives going up in smoke. This particular scene is one of the highlights that the director talks about on the commentary track on the DVD.Nominated for Best Original Screenplay the story in the Train is intelligently simple focusing on characterization as the basis of the conflict. All of the action follows from the desire of the main players in the story and although there is a good guy and a bad guy there are no pure motives. Every character justifies what he does convincingly.Col. Waldheim wants to take the paintings back to Germany so that the American bombs do not destroy them whereas Labiche is interested in stopping the train of paintings mainly as a kick in the groin to German political intentions.It is the rationale of each character that determines where our sympathies lie. We are shown the Germans through Waldheim as lovers of culture but cruel and insensitive to human emotions. We see the French through Labiche as simple honest hardworking people and their art as an extension of their humanity.Walter Bernstein screenwriter for The Train as well as Yanks understood how this characterdriven action psychologically affects and involves the viewer. By having Waldheim voice his emotions in taking the art and having Labiche voice his determination the script affects us viscerally by our identification with each character at different levels.The great high contrast black and white print really allows the drama to come through in the actioner. In more than one instance the stolen art is spoken of as the great treasures of France. Ironically the art in the movie shown in black and white in the first scene is never shown again only spoken of and this makes it a living thing in the characters minds and our own as well.It is the black and white print used in many night scenes showing simple action that creates such a compelling tale of Labiche and his ability to outwit the General Waldheim and divert the paintings of Henri Matisse Paul Gauguin and other artists from being commandeered by the Germans.Burt Lancaster shows his stuff doing many of his own stunts. The guy was 50 years old when he made this movie! We see the actor fall from trains slide down ladders lift large train mechanisms from an Ironworking smelting shop and climb up and down mountains actions even the heartiest Baby Boomer will marvel at.Lancaster's acting is perfectly pitched for the movie. At one point I wondered why there wasn't a French actor in the role considering that Labiche is a French man but the American accent doesn't really distract.Scofield as the German General in charge of the train is English and his accent doesn't distract either. In both cases the attitude of the actor is what makes the role successful and each is perfectly cast.The support cast is excellent and work from a wellwritten script. Jeanne Moreau as Christine the hotel owner exhibits a combination of brittle emotions ranging from anger to suspicion to forgiveness to affection.Michel Simon as Papa Boule who cripples the art train out of spite for the Germans has one moment when he speaks about a former girlfriend that opens a light on the sensitivity of this otherwise irascible old man.".

There as so many great characters and actors and with the astounding special effects of rail yard bombs and screaming steam trains it's all crammed in to this lavish production.

The writing is impeccable and there is even a relatively sympathetic characterisation of the nonetheless still brutal German officer. There's jeopardy and death left right and centre and what I found the crowning achievement is that it's an intelligent film which even poses the question as to what the point of all the suffering was for for Art?

	schema:headline "  The French resistance keeping the Germans off track!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not a bad movie set in WWII about an French train driver that plans to thwart the Germans from looting some important works of art. These are some well renowned paintings which the Germans plan to take back to Berlin. Although it is WWII it's important to note that none of what actually unfolds contributes anything to the overall campaign on the western front nor does it have any bearing on the outcome of the war as a whole. It's simply just a story very much in the mold of THE DIARY OF ANN FRANK or OPERATION AMSTERDAM who are also shot in claustrophobic black and white. While both stories are fascinating neither are important in deciding the outcome of the war or even contributing to it in any meaningful way.

The deranged and obsessive German who is given the task to transfer these work of art's is Col. Von Waldheim played by Paul Scholfield and he is supported by the more cool headed Maj.

Col.Von Waldheim is not only carrying out orders but is also motivated by a personal love for these paintings. Labiche on the other hand has no personal love for them but perhaps emboldened by the German retreat and the impending liberation from US or free French forces. Determined not to allow the Germans who had humiliated them for so long steal in broad daylight some of Frances most valuable artworks he decides to plan an elaborate scheme to slow the progress down and fool the Germans into thinking that the paintings are actually being transported back to Germany.

It's an interesting point you wonder why many of them knowing that the Germans were on the run didn't just knuckle down or go into hiding and ride out the last few days. Why risk so much? The ending of the movie was quite poignant. You had the Germans putting vast amounts of man power time and effort into looting these French paintings and harassing the local population none of this was helping the war effort and Lancaster and fellow Resistance fighters laying their lives on the line not harassing the retreating Germans but trying to save the paintings. In the end the final scene sums up the madness of what has unfolded whether it is Labiches efforts the German desire to get the paintings or just the war as a whole. Good performances from the lead actors not a bad watch!".

	onyx:emotionText "This is not a bad movie set in WWII about an French train driver that plans to thwart the Germans from looting some important works of art. These are some well renowned paintings which the Germans plan to take back to Berlin. Although it is WWII it's important to note that none of what actually unfolds contributes anything to the overall campaign on the western front nor does it have any bearing on the outcome of the war as a whole. It's simply just a story very much in the mold of THE DIARY OF ANN FRANK or OPERATION AMSTERDAM who are also shot in claustrophobic black and white. While both stories are fascinating neither are important in deciding the outcome of the war or even contributing to it in any meaningful way.

	schema:reviewBody "During WWII in the final day of the German occupation of France a German colonel and a true art lover Col. Von Waldheim Paul Scofield orders his troops to crate and transport all the great impressionistic paintings from the Jeu de Paume Museum that he can possibly get his hands on. These paintings are not only among the best in the world they are worth millions in Reichsmarks. The crated paintings are loaded onto a train to be sent to Germany. But the train must arrive in Germany before the Allies liberate France. While von Waldheim is obsessed with getting the train OUT of France the French Resistance represented by Labiche Burt Lancaster becomes equally determined to keep the train IN France while waiting for the Allied liberation. Very few in the Resistance understand the artistic value of the cargo but they know that it represents 'their nation's honor' and see how valuable it must be based on von Waldheim's determination to have it. And while the Germans control the trains the railroad workers form a great network of Resistance fighters.The Resistance does everything in its power to sabotage their own rail system and lead the Germans away from Germany. Small French towns are 'relabeled' to make the Germans riding on the train think that they are going one way when they are really going in another trains are re routed by conductors switchmen and engineers and rail cars are separated from engines used to block tracks and cause train wrecks. Germans in their frustration kill many Frenchman in retaliation. However the battle over the train continues to the bitter end.Another Frankenheimer blackandwhite masterpiece this action movie is riveting from beginning to end. It pits the wills skills and ingenuity of the two principal characters in a seemly ceaseless series of catandmouse ploys to control the train. The cinematography is also great. The constant imagery of trains being twisted and turned stopped and started heaving and letting off stem stand in stark contrast to the art that they carry and the men that try to control them. In this movie Frankenheimer turns trains and rails into 'living breathing characters of steam and steel.' Scofield and Lancaster are both excellent in their opposing roles. I would rank this movie among the best movies I have ever seen!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fictionalized account of something that did occur towards the end of WWII. When it appeared that the Germans would lose the war some of their leaders ordered the systematic looting of occupied territoriesparticularly of the great art museums of Paris. This film is about one of these shipmentsa shipment that the French Underground wants to prevent from going into Germany BUT also want to be sure not to destroy.Burt Lancaster plays the lead as the French train engineer forced to transport this shipment. Why did they choose an American for this role? Probably to increase the marketability and box office for the film. While Lancaster was wonderful for the role for his physicality it was odd that a Frenchman or at least a man who could approximate the proper accent was not used. In addition a Canadian Paul Scofield was hired to play the leading German in the filmthough he also didn't sound the least bit German. While a fine actor he was not the best choice for the role either. As for the rest of the cast they were all more suited for the role. It was also nice to see the Swiss actor Michel Simon in the filmas he'd starred in some wonderful films since the 1930swhere he also looked like an old man! Here at age 70 he finally looked his age! This is a film that left me with mixed feelings. On one hand you need to hand it to the director the great John Frankenheimer for being so meticulous and getting the look of the film just right with amazing stunts and attention to detail as well as great cinematography. But on the other despite this being a very wellrespected film its pace was way too slowand could have benefited from a slight trimming. Now I am NOT against longer filmsprovided the pacing and story is sufficient to support it. Here 20 minutes lopped off might have made the film flow betterand made it a great film despite the odd casting. As it was it did drag a bit. I liked the film but did not love it. Though as a history teacher I really did appreciate the film's historical accuracy.".

However near the end of the movie there is a closeup shot of his bloodied trouser leg against the background of a box of French masterpieces.What has changed his mind? Those around him who do decide to act to save the art. They have in effect painted a picture for Labiche of something more important than people something that war can't touch and that is impossible to express in words. It's not just the artwork  Papa Boule decides to act after hearing there are Renoirs in the hoard because he once dated a woman who had posed for Renoir but Labiche's friend tells him that he's never seen these paintings and after the war is over maybe they should go check them out. It is rather a spark an inner vision that passes from these people to Labiche.Everybody has a grim face especially when the Nazi officials are around but the Nazis too are longfaced and grim. With the exception of the one German officer on board the train who lightens up a bit when he thinks they're in Germany the only time people relax and smile in this movie is when they are talking about the artwork. By the time the quick series of camera shots happen at the very end of the movie it's very easy to see those boxes as packing the only light and color and gaiety left in a dreary and brutal world.In addition I couldn't help thinking that Buster Keaton must have loved this film when it came out. The camera work alone must have fascinated him. Too the train crash in it is just as dramatic expensive and satisfying as the scene in Keaton's The General when he put a locomotive into a creek. Keaton also used a scene of decoupling the engine from the box car on a moving train in The General and there is a fascinating sequence in it where Keaton walks into town alongside a victorious army returning from the battlefield and yet in spite of all the hoopla the viewer is drawn to and remains focused on Keaton even when he goes to one side and sits down. In The Train Lancaster draws the camera in that excellent shot where the machinery of war fills the train yard with a grand hubbub and Labiche walks through it  you can't help but focus on the walking man in spite of everything else going on. It's an excellent and extended portrayal of man versus the machine. After that we don't need any exposition of why Labiche train man though he is is working with the resistance.Excellent movie!".

Yet for me this is not just one of the finest movies but is also one of the finest works of art in existence. As a War Film though it is actually quite weak as The Train is not concerned with war. The final days of World War Two are the setting for the film and the impetus for the plot but the battle that takes place is not about the dominance of armies the brutality of soldiers or the heroism of combat. This is a struggle about the nature of Art  or even Nature V. Art. Does Art represent the living spirit the achievement of Nature as embodied in the very physical machinery of the train engines  machines built for a function yet breathing spitting gloriously living works of art. Or does Art represent higher ideals cold calculating observing  dismissive of all lower concerns including human life. The anonymous distant authorities in London and the cold calculating German officer Col. von Waldheim who use and abuse the lives of the French in order to keep control of the Art seem to desire something different to the French resistance who are prepared to struggle suffer and sacrifice their lives for an ideal which sums up a vision of life born out of France ... our pride what we create. A very breathing spitting gloriously living vision of Art. The doubting questioning very real and human Frenchman Labiche may not get excited to stand near the crates of Art but he shows a much deeper understanding of the beauty of human nature in his very existence. He is in himself a work of art  a human who defies who is prepared to stand up and defend his fellow man to the very end. Admirable worthy  displaying all the qualities we admire in humans  resourcefulness compassion resilience adaptability true grit and determination. Even the cold Col. von Waldheim recognises the art in Labiche and wants him to be part of the package he is taking to Germany. Shot in gritty living black and white with a stunning depth of texture and backed with a soundtrack drenched in the animalistic breath of the huge trains this is a compelling drama. The action scenes are as emotionally stunning as the human cameos are quietly moving. Yes there are flaws  such as apart from Waldheim the German characters are mere cyphers on which to hang the film they have no character or motivation. But these are quibbles. This is a huge film painted on a huge canvas  beautiful to look at to listen to and to be drawn into. A masterpiece in any genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here we have a love story set in a quadrangled apartment block in Prague during the Second World War as background the real life assassination of cruel Nazi despot Reinhardt Heydrich and the resultant inhuman reprisals. By coincidence a young Jewish refugee Hanka arrives at the apartment block a day after her contacts have departed totally alone she is befriended by Aryan teenager Pavel who stows her away in a storeroom up in the rafters where he usually develops photos.There's something very curiously appealing about the motif of the isolated ethereal and quiet Jewess Hanka in this movie is reminiscent of Rowena in Sir Walter Scott's famous novel Ivanhoe though speaking in ethnic terms is somewhat of a betrayal of the love between Hanka and Pavel he points out that terms like Aryan are their language.I think that innocence is the prevailing theme the setting a rather barren and lonely one for such a pretty flower. In my corner of the world teenagers videomessage each other homebrew pornography watch videos of beheadings on the internet and play vandalsimulation computer games. In the world that Jir Weiss has createdresurrected the lovers discuss moving to the North Pole as a day there lasts six months of the year. For them it is a magic place heard of only in books instead of a place which a group of idiots race to in a fourbyfour on television if you don't teeth with that popular culture reference consider yourself fortunate.What's quite realistic in the movie is the way in which love thrives on reliance. Hanka is dead without Pavel who sells off prize possessions in order to keep her fed. This in counterpoint to modern times and my corner of the world where a woman needs a man as they say like a fish needs a bicycle and often romantic love exists if at all as a knowing postironic pretence rather than as an enveloping universe or the velvet swaddle that it can be. An analogy of Hanka and Pavel's love in the movie is of a binary system two stars orbiting around one centre of gravity alone together in vastness. By the by Pavel identifies Proxima Centauri as binary whereas in fact it is nearby Alpha Centauri which is binary.Hanka is so curious she has mysterious aquiline features and a feeling of comfortable fatalism if that isn't too odd a thing to say which is shown in material terms by the ease with which she wears her StarofDavidtagged overcoat. If you've ever held a small bird you will know this feeling of fragility hollow bones and feather contribute to a feeling that you're holding a fragile almostnothingness in your hands. There's something of that in spritely Hanka. I think Pavel is a great and interesting Romeo he's so gentle and kind but really powerless which you can see when a false alarm happens and he almost disintegrates.The ethnic tensions in the movie are worth exploring Prague was historically a multicultural city and contained a sizable population of ethnic Germans Aryans and also Germanspeaking Jews. It's therefore not unusual to find a lady in the movie who is Czech by nationality but also speaks fluent German and has taken up with a German Wehrmacht officer. This population of German speakers lived under considerable threat naturally viewed as collaborators with varying degrees of accuracy an end to occupation a threat as much as a relief. Indeed after the war the controversial Bene decrees realised that threat and initiated the forced exile of the majority of the Germanspeaking population.There's potentially profit to be gained from comparing this to another Eastern European WWII city under siege Lwow from Zulawski's The Third Part of the Night 1971. Zulawski's film is all blanched nausea surreal fractured like a fever dream. Romeo Juliet and Darkness by contrast is more benign chary of showing violence sedate and making good use of suggestion and implication for example the lingering thought of the nighttime of six months which is basically the Heydrich incident. Despite the very innocent and unassuming nature of both the filming characters and the subject I think the movie speaks loudly of love and tolerance and should be commended.For my friend Claire.".

The story takes place against the background of the Nazi occupation of Prague and more specifically the horrible repercussions visited upon the population after the assassination of Heydrich the leading Nazi in Czechoslovakia. A young man in his final year at school takes in and shelters in the attic of his mother's house a Jewish girl of the same age going to great pains both to conceal her presence and to find food for her. Weiss's direction is superb with particularly good establishment of the atmosphere of the flats where most of the action occurs. Watching the move now one almost feels one is present in the Prague of 1942 the movie being particularly effective at showing how routine life goes on under even the most harsh of political circumstances. The two young actors in the lead roles both give excellent and very moving performances. There are also a range of vividlydrawn characters in the background. At least two things make the film noteworthy looking at it from today's perspective. First the film is almost wholly free of any propagandistic elements presumably quite an achievement given the time and place of its production. The film with its emphasis on a humanistic depiction on the trials of ordinary people points towards the Czech New Wave films which would appear five or six years later. Second Weiss's direction is such that the film is simultaneously vivid and yet understated the relative absence of histrionics making it all the more absorbing. The denouement is very powerful indeed making the film available on DVD in the UK one that is very worthwhile seeking out. I bought the DVD not knowing what to expect I ended up watching a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set during World War II in Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia a young man in Prague shelters a Jewish girl knowing that in trying to save her life he is putting the lives of all those around him in grave danger. Events are complicated further with the assassination of Reinhardt Heydrich the top Nazi leader who ruled over Czechoslovakia with an iron fist. His killing leads to brutal reprisals by the Nazi authorities meaning that Jews and those who shelter them find themselves under even greater scrutiny and peril.I was surprised to learn after watching this one that it was made some time before the Czech New Wave began. It is clearly a very forwardlooking and bold film for its time. Completely convincing and realistic at all times it is in essence a doomed love story with the backdrop of the European Holocaust hovering darkly always in the background. As such it is quite a depressing story but to tell it any other way would be to ignore the horror of the facts of the time. Despite the historic events involving the Heydrich assassination the approach taken to the narrative is a highly personal one with the events rarely going beyond the apartment block in which the characters live. Acting is strong across the board with Daniela Smutn as the girl and Ivan Mistrk as the boy who tries to help her both especially good. This is a strong film in many ways and one of the chief ones being that you understand why everyone acts the way they do even if certain characters act despicably. But fear and oppression has a way of bringing out the bad in many of us but also the good in some too. This highly impressive war drama should be more widely seen.".

This is 11 of 10 stars not one less.So the plot. I don't think there is anything more beautiful in the world as pure young love everyone who was in love as a child can emphasize with that. No hesitation no questions just two souls melting in harmony. I fear as we grow older most of us loose their capability of feeling that way there is just to much stress and influence on us what a pity. So... to the point never has a movie not just anime projected this feeling of a young soul desperately in love more precise and moving than this one. I am a 26 year old man and I don't know when I cried the last time but at a certain point in the movie I found myself dropping a big tear.But beware the movie is about chapter one. The second still beautiful and honest with a great metaphor and the very nice idea of changing the lead character giving another angle on the subject can just not compel with the first. And as many others I did not like the last chapter either but it is need to be said that this plot does not harmonize with a good old fashioned Hollywood happy end as most of the viewers would expect or rather demand I could say. This is a Japanese movie and Japanese movies take another angle on life itself. Just take it as it comes. This is definitely art.If you are a romantic one and open to art movies this will become a piece of your soul. Honest thanks to the makers.".

Basically 5cm Per Second is a short movies split up into 3 episodes the first one being 30 min the second one 20 min and the last one 15 min. Each of these three episodes portrays a pair of people and their relationship during childhood adolescence and adulthood. The story that it has is very simple and could be summarized in a few sentences but that is not the point of this series. The real point is the volumes of material that could be written about the emotion feeling and beauty that can found in this masterpiece. As you watch this you will be able to distinctly feel for these characters and you will be able to connect with them as if you actually knew them because of how human and relatable they feel. You will be able to feel exactly the same as they do because in your childhood you will have felt precisely the same at some point and this connection comes through wonderfully. Only adding to this sense of wonder is what might by some of the better pacing in a series to date. Simply the way the characters progress and the way that it seemingly ends as soon as it starts will haunt you for hours or days afterwards. What strongly supports this anime is the excellent animation which stunning and the music which while not jawdroppingly amazing still does not leave anything to be desired.In short do yourself a favor take an hour out of your day to watch this beautiful work of art.".

However deep inside we all know that those situations could never occur in real life that in reality everything would have been so much more simple and probably sad. Sometimes we even find ourselves wanting to see the 'reallife versions' of the plots..Well in this movie there are no 'lucky circumstances' no happystrange moments.

I enjoyed Voices of A Distant Star and The Place Promised in Our Early Days But I never thought that he could pull off another great film.Plotwise it has similarities with his previous worksVoices of A Distant Star but it manages to create a different atmosphere here. Watching all 3 short stories consecutively I'll have to say the final chapter was the best among 3. The pinnacle however is the first one. Second chapter is a little slowpaced but it matches the movie theme nicely.Can't have much complain towards the music. As usual Tenmon proves he's got the talent with emotional piano pieces. The theme song is nice as well.Animation  visual effects is stunning. Makoto Shinkai definitely gets a solid certificate to be one of the best visual directors out there at the moment. Overall a 910 for me. It's almost flawless but nothing can be perfect right? ".

	schema:headline " Essentially an illustrated novella";
	schema:reviewBody "For me the difference between cinema and literature is that while the latter is fundamentally about words the former should tell its story at least as much through visuals and movement as through dialogue. 5 Centimeters Per Second however tells its story almost completely through words. You could simply read the script and get the entire story.For example the first of the movie's three episodes begins after a snippet of dialogue with a series of read letters while you watch their receiver go about his day. The bulk of the episode is a train ride in which his anxiety over train delays is expressed mainly by hearing his thoughts about how anxious he is. Shut your eyes and you wouldn't miss a bit of story.You would admittedly miss some really stunning animation.

	onyx:emotionText "For me the difference between cinema and literature is that while the latter is fundamentally about words the former should tell its story at least as much through visuals and movement as through dialogue. 5 Centimeters Per Second however tells its story almost completely through words. You could simply read the script and get the entire story.For example the first of the movie's three episodes begins after a snippet of dialogue with a series of read letters while you watch their receiver go about his day. The bulk of the episode is a train ride in which his anxiety over train delays is expressed mainly by hearing his thoughts about how anxious he is. Shut your eyes and you wouldn't miss a bit of story.You would admittedly miss some really stunning animation.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow what a pretty movie! The backgrounds were gorgeous and the animation was beautiful I applaud the artists who worked on this film. However in the plot department 5 Centimeters per Second is sorely lacking.Chapter one was good I did enjoy the first part. Childhood friends who fell in love but their parent's jobs keep them apart. It was adorable and set up for a beautiful tragic love story. After seeing it I expected the rest of the movie to be just that a beautiful tragic love story. But then came part two. Where did Akari go? They just stopped talking? I don't know I think if they were really as in love as we're meant to believe they are they wouldn't lose touch. But I didn't lose hope yet this movie could still be good. Everyone encounters problems in their relationship perhaps this was all leading up to a big dramatic reunion at the end.And once again I was disappointed in part three. Takaki is still thinking about Akari even after all these years so maybe he'll look for her or write her or something. But nope he makes no effort to get in touch with her. Okay so maybe it'd be awkward. It probably would be they hadn't talked in who knows how long. But then they pass each other in the street recognize each other stop and look like they're about to finally speak to one another again. Then a train passes between them and they just walk away. WHAT? Most disappointing ending of all time.Maybe Shinkai was trying to say there are no happy endings but damn.In fact I found the movie as a whole to be quite disappointing. It was a lot shorter than it should have been. It spent too much time dwelling on less important things leaving not nearly enough time for things like character development and plot development. Maybe I'm being harsh but I found that we never got to know Akari we never even really got to know Takaki. The person we got to know most was Kanae And she's only really relevant in the second part. We hardly got to see Takaki and Akari's relationship so it was difficult to feel Takaki's pain and longing over Akari. Overall I found this movie rushed through things that deserved more time and don't really understand what it was trying to accomplish. Was it a romance? Clearly but where it the romance? Where is the struggle to keep their flame alive? If Takaki loved Akari why didn't he go after her at the end? They were best friends he should at least have said something. I'm sorry but I don't understand why people enjoyed this movie so much. I think is was a poorly paced plot with little development and beautiful visuals in attempt to razzledazzle the audience. I apologize for my unpopular opinion.".

	schema:headline " Fantastic scenes Powerful story";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie is subtitled a chain of short stories about their distance and I can think of no better way of summarizing it without giving away the mystery.5 Centimeters Per Second can be classified as a lovedrama film as it contains plenty of both.I recommend this movie even to those that dislike anime because if you watch just four minutes of the movie you simply forget you are looking at a Japanesestyle film. The emotions are very powerful and you just cannot help but love the characters. It was very hard for me to give it 910 stars but I felt like the second episode was missing something. Story 5 Centimeters Per Second is composed of three chaptersepisodes. Makoto Shinkai does a fantastic job at creating a story that immediately finds a way into your soul. Despite being an anime movie there are no SciFi nor any Fantasy elements. It is simply a reflection of life with it's struggles and obstacles that come together in deep moments.SPOILERThe first chapter tells the story of close friends Takaki Tno and Akari Shinohara and how time and space forces them to go their separate ways. After graduating elementary school the two keep in touch by writing letters and visit each other one more time before Takaki and his family move further away from Akari's town. Despite the two's mutual special feelings they do not speak about them until their last meeting.The second chapter introduces Kanae Sumita a classmate of Takaki that falls in love with him but cannot express her feelings to him. One day she notices Takaki staring into the distance and understands that he is searching for something far grater than her.The third episode finds our character in very different situations. Years later we see Akari somewhat happy getting ready to marry a man but still melancholic after finding an old letter of hers addressed to Takaki. In another place in Japan Takaki has a job but lives alone and cannot let go of his past memories.SPOILER Art and Animation The environment instantly sucks you in and you find yourself immersed inside the same dreamlike situation like Takaki Tno. The movie has one of the greatest artistic presentations of it's genre. Many may shy away from the prospect of watching a movie that has love and drama as center elements but the movie is worth watching for the art alone. Makoto Shinkai has created perfect environments enhanced by light and details such as individual grass seeds moving in the wind. The style of animation is fantastic. Takaki's simple gestures of frustration while waiting in the delayed train speak out better than any words. Characters and voice acting At first glance the characters look like the average Japanese hikikomori introvert but it's hard to imagine any other characters taking part in such sweet and heartwarming situations. All the three soon to be adults find it hard to express their feelings which gives the viewer something to relate to. The voice acting is relatively good. Although the fastpace Japanese language may be hard to get used to the actors' whispers and thoughts are able to send out powerful emotions.Music The music composed by Tenmon consists mostly of piano elements and also a song used for Episode 3 One more time one more chance written and performed by Masayoshi Yamazaki. All these go extremely well with the melancholic atmosphere of the movie. Overall If you like beautiful art and animation plus a good story then 5 Centimeters Per Second is a mustsee. Even though it is only one hour long the movie talks about heartbraking situations and hidden feelings things we can all relate to. Just make sure you have a box of tissues with you before watching.

They are not perfect but since they are almost tone poems of emotion its okay.I missed this at the NY Children's film festival and had to wait for the DVD release...Oh man I thought it was tough for parents to explain the Girl who Leapt through TimeWhat would parents and young kids have made of this? I know the kids would have trouble processing it since their experience wouldn't allow for it and the parents would probably be broken hearted...mommy why are you crying? How do you explain this sort of emotion to a child?As for me I have no idea what to say... Similar and yet different to the directors Voices From a Distant Star this is a film about distance and communication or lack there of and how the heart approaches what it yearns...I am moved to somewhere beyond words. Echoes of my own life aside there is something about the emotion that moves youwhy am I crying? I don't know. The wall against such things has been punctured and while the tears were never a torrent there was a few moments where they definitely flowed.Its not perfectfrankly I don't know what it is but it moved me...Take my advice and that of the song at the endtell the person you love that you love them.PS In theory the three parts of the movie can be seen separately...but in reality I doubt that they would work as well in parts certainly the third one won't since all of the emotion come from the first two parts.".

How do you explain this sort of emotion to a child?As for me I have no idea what to say... Similar and yet different to the directors Voices From a Distant Star this is a film about distance and communication or lack there of and how the heart approaches what it yearns...I am moved to somewhere beyond words. Echoes of my own life aside there is something about the emotion that moves youwhy am I crying? I don't know. The wall against such things has been punctured and while the tears were never a torrent there was a few moments where they definitely flowed.Its not perfectfrankly I don't know what it is but it moved me...Take my advice and that of the song at the endtell the person you love that you love them.PS In theory the three parts of the movie can be seen separately...but in reality I doubt that they would work as well in parts certainly the third one won't since all of the emotion come from the first two parts.";

For me the best part is storyline. Most intensive drama I've ever seen. I would never think that animated movie could touch such topics and more important that it would do this in such a great way.I've already watched it 3 times and every time I cried like a girl. Maybe this is because I've been in all those situations. I've been like Takaki loving someone with the purest love of all  love of a child. I've been like Kanae  loving someone and not having courage to say it. I've been on the other side like Takaki again being with someone who loved me when I was still with love with someone else. And again been like 3rd chapter Takaki daydreaming of love that is gone that would never come back ...In that move all those feelings are drawn so gentle and sharp at the same time. I've never seen feelings pictured that great and I've seen plenty of movies.Storyline is something great here ... but scenery is another masterpiece. After watching that movie Japan seems the best place on Earth to live. Sea heaven clouds grass wind mountains everything here seems so alive. But the best thing is play of the light. Everything here is so natural sometimes even seems better than in real world. All lightning here brings memories of places and things I've experienced before.Characters seems to be kinda mysterious cause they are Japan. Japanese people keeps their feelings deeper then Europeans so sometimes this could look a bit odd. But even though I feel like I'm experiencing all those things again. Some says that animation of characters is a flaw here but for me it's at the proper level. Just where it should be.And last piece of this puzzle is music. Not overwhelming and greatly composed into this picture. And ending song ... even I don't understand Japanese at all it makes my eyes wet every time I hear it.Seen tons of bad average good and great movies but this one is the best I've ever seen.Thank you Makoto Shinkai.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title of the film 5 Centimeters Per Second signifies the speed at which cherry blossoms fall. It also is a metaphor for how our lives and our relationships slowly evolve over time. This is fitting because 5 Centimeters Per Second is one of the most real and emotionally moving movies I have ever come across and a 10 star rating isn't enough to do it justice it should probably be a 12 stars out of 10. From the very first frame of the movie you will be struck by the awe inspiring beauty of the animation. Unlike the saying that beauty is only skin deep this movie has a soul that is more beautiful than its animation. Unlike many other movies 5 Centimeters Per Second keeps its theme simple LOVE. The film explores the emotions pain and evolution of even our most cherished relationships when strained by time and distance. We take this journey over 3 phases of life with Takaki Tono Akari Shinohara and Kanae Sumida with each phase dealing with a different aspect of the relationships.The Music in the film is on par with the animation in that it is completely mesmerizing after seeing the film the soundtrack has the power to bring back those emotions long after the film has ended. The music is just natural and beautiful as rest of the movie.Makoto Shinkai has done an excellent job weaving a movie that is so deeply moving and so beautiful around a very simple but powerful story. If you have not seen it yet 5 Centimeters Per Second is definitely one to see. I've seen it 4 times already since discovering it and have loved it even more every time. This movie is truly a masterpiece especially when you add the fact that there are no science fiction or fantasy angles to it but it is a view into real life through anime. The film really reaches into your gut and grabs your soul.5 Centimeters Per Second is a brilliantly emotional movie that will touch your heart and ingrain itself in your soul. A must watch for anyone who has not seen it yet. Spoilers Beyond This Point Do Not Read If You Have Not Seen the Film! I was moved by all 3 of the main Characters in this film as I could feel how true their love was as well as feel their pain.Takaki Tono  From the start of the movie we see Takaki tell the story from his point of view and there are several points where you really feel his pain such as when he is on the train to go see Akari after one year of distance and despite his longing to see her when he realizes how late he will be he thinks to himself Akari please don't wait for me. His concern for her over himself shows that he really does care for her. There are many more instances in the movie when you feel his pain such as when you realize all the emails that he is writing are actually not going out to anyone but to no one. Akari Shinohara  You feel Akari express her pain when Tono flashes back to when she had called him to inform him that they would not be lucky enough to attend the same Junior High together because her parents and her were moving away. Tono says he could feel her pain through the phone and this same pain is conveyed to the viewers. It is also evident that Akari does love and care for Tono because she waits far beyond the expected time for Tono with no guarantee he will be there but her heart telling her so.Kanae Sumida  She is probably the character I sympathize with most because throughout the second part we see that for years she has lived in an obsession and love of Takaki Tono comparable only to His for Akari but a the same time despite her obsessive love Kanae is able to realize that Tono does not love her and in fact never seems to look at her. Her understanding of the person she loves and selflessness of not revealing her feelings to him after this realization really make her love mean something and this also makes me feel the most pain for her because she is the one character that does not even get a grain of the love she gets back.The 3 parts the movie is divided in also explore different kinds of distance and the pain that it can cause. The first part is about the physical distance and the pain and longing that it creates within both Akari and Takaki. The second section is about the emotional distance between Kanae and Takaki. And the 3rd Section is about the pain of not being able to let go as Takaki is still unable to let go of his memories of Akari and in some ways is more in love with them than Akari herself. The brilliant ending scenes with the song especially the train crossing really cap of an excellent movie. End of Spoilers Makoto Shinkai manages an emotional connection with anime that very few live action movies can even claim to produce. All in all this is one of the instant classics and masterpieces. If you haven't seen it this is absolutely one to watch as it is a brilliant film on every level and from every aspect. This is art at its best in all phases. The story animation and music are brilliantly woven into the soul of this movie not only mesmerizing you with its beauty but moving you and leaving a permanent impression on your soul1210 Must Watch!!!!

	schema:headline " Alluring. Touching. Veracious. Beautiful. Ingenious... Miyazaki consider yourself warned!";
	schema:reviewBody "Do you know the speed at which cherry blossoms fall? 5 centimeters per second... At what speed must I live to be able to see you again? Another Japanese film that proves yet again how this country is doing it all wrong. Like their style of living and architecture Japanese film is about simplicity with depth beauty expressed with such subtlety that you never see it coming and sophistication while remaining lighthearted. 5 Centimeters Per Second Referring to the rate at which the petals fall from a Cherry Blossom Tree artfully explicates love loss yearning regret strength perseverance in three interconnected episodes in the young male protagonists' life First as a preteen then as a teenager and finally as an adult after life had yet again taken priority over love. Beautiful cinematography beautiful colors beautiful music. Most of all beautiful words. I am aware this is a graphic novel but had it been written as a novel I have no doubt this would be one of my all time favorites. Makoto Shinkai paints pictures emotions characters like Monet with a paintbrush. And right then it felt like I finally understood where everything was eternity the heart  the soul. It was like I was sharing every experience I'd ever had in my past 13 years. And then the next moment I became unbearably sad. I didn't know what to do with these feeling. Her warmth her soul. How was I supposed to treat them? That I did not know. Then right then I clearly understood that we would never be together. Our lives not yet fully realized the vast expanse of time. They lay before us and there was nothing we could do. But then all my worries all my doubt started melting away. All that was left were her soft lips on mine. When I read her letters I always envisioned her alone. In the end the train spent around two hours... motionless in the middle of nowhere. Every minute seemed like an eternity. Time felt heavy with malice as it slowly crept by. All I could do was grit my teeth and try to hold back my tears. The things I had to tell her and the things I hoped she would listen to. There were so many of them. My one wish right now? To have a love like theirs. Of course in my world I refuse to accept the realities in life. In true denial I tell you with confidence that I would make this work out to conclude with fireworks a wedding a happily ever after. Over the past few years I've wanted to move on. I wanted to grasp on to something beyond my reach. What that is I don't even know. All I've been able to do is go on working. Then one day I realized that my heart was withering and in it there was nothing but pain. One morning I realized that the beliefs I had once held so passionately had disappeared. That was it I could not take it anymore... The passage of time and distance are two motifs always in the background illustrating how it can both diminish and heal our pain especially that caused by vivid relationships. Questions surrounding decision making and the process surrounding it are also explored from different angles and point of views how sometimes the best ones can be the hardest to make how sometimes we are not given the option to choose how growing up and attaining the power to do so in certain circumstances is not always a progression to be coveted as we have no one to blame but ourselves. Although it is an animation Which by the way is done beautifully the problems explored questions raised and answers revealed are quite mature.

Sometimes we make difficult decisions that we regret. Sometimes we have to live with the consequences. But what keeps us going in life especially in matters of the heart? Hope. Yesterday I had a dream... A dream I have had since long ago. In that dream we had yet to turn 13. We were in a vast countryside completely covered with snow. The lights of the houses extended far into the distance a dazzling sight. We walked on the thick carpet of fresh snow but did not leave any footprints... And because of that we both believed without any doubt that someday we'd watch the cherry blossoms fall again together.".

	onyx:emotionText "Do you know the speed at which cherry blossoms fall? 5 centimeters per second... At what speed must I live to be able to see you again? Another Japanese film that proves yet again how this country is doing it all wrong. Like their style of living and architecture Japanese film is about simplicity with depth beauty expressed with such subtlety that you never see it coming and sophistication while remaining lighthearted. 5 Centimeters Per Second Referring to the rate at which the petals fall from a Cherry Blossom Tree artfully explicates love loss yearning regret strength perseverance in three interconnected episodes in the young male protagonists' life First as a preteen then as a teenager and finally as an adult after life had yet again taken priority over love. Beautiful cinematography beautiful colors beautiful music. Most of all beautiful words. I am aware this is a graphic novel but had it been written as a novel I have no doubt this would be one of my all time favorites. Makoto Shinkai paints pictures emotions characters like Monet with a paintbrush. And right then it felt like I finally understood where everything was eternity the heart  the soul. It was like I was sharing every experience I'd ever had in my past 13 years. And then the next moment I became unbearably sad. I didn't know what to do with these feeling. Her warmth her soul. How was I supposed to treat them? That I did not know. Then right then I clearly understood that we would never be together. Our lives not yet fully realized the vast expanse of time. They lay before us and there was nothing we could do. But then all my worries all my doubt started melting away. All that was left were her soft lips on mine. When I read her letters I always envisioned her alone. In the end the train spent around two hours... motionless in the middle of nowhere. Every minute seemed like an eternity. Time felt heavy with malice as it slowly crept by. All I could do was grit my teeth and try to hold back my tears. The things I had to tell her and the things I hoped she would listen to. There were so many of them. My one wish right now? To have a love like theirs. Of course in my world I refuse to accept the realities in life. In true denial I tell you with confidence that I would make this work out to conclude with fireworks a wedding a happily ever after. Over the past few years I've wanted to move on. I wanted to grasp on to something beyond my reach. What that is I don't even know. All I've been able to do is go on working. Then one day I realized that my heart was withering and in it there was nothing but pain. One morning I realized that the beliefs I had once held so passionately had disappeared. That was it I could not take it anymore... The passage of time and distance are two motifs always in the background illustrating how it can both diminish and heal our pain especially that caused by vivid relationships. Questions surrounding decision making and the process surrounding it are also explored from different angles and point of views how sometimes the best ones can be the hardest to make how sometimes we are not given the option to choose how growing up and attaining the power to do so in certain circumstances is not always a progression to be coveted as we have no one to blame but ourselves. Although it is an animation Which by the way is done beautifully the problems explored questions raised and answers revealed are quite mature. Yet they are shown in such a way that even young children would be able to understand at a certain level. As in real life we cannot always have happilyeverafters. Sometimes love in unrequited. Sometimes we make difficult decisions that we regret. Sometimes we have to live with the consequences. But what keeps us going in life especially in matters of the heart? Hope.

	schema:reviewBody "5 Centimeters Per Second contains three short stories connected by the main character and his childhood loveinterest essentially following their grow up. As many others already marked the animation is simply gorgeous and I can't add any more to this  Makoto Shinkai is indubitably one of the greatest animation geniuses of all time.While the visuals are superb the plot is mediocre at best. I'm an otherwise emotionally sturdy levelheaded guy but I'm also an absolute sucker for romantic tragedys. This stuff  even the cheesier ones  can make my eyes wet like putting my head in a bucket full of red onion. With 5CPS however my eyes remained dry and my heart remained... err... unbroken? Each sequence is overshadowed by the immense despair of Takaki longing for his neverfulfilled love to Akari. In the first episode Cherryblossoms it works well my suspense built with Takakis during the train scene and I felt soooo relieved when Akari was still at the station. It was sweet. During the sad goodbye I was sure they were going to meet again and that we're going towards a happy end. The second sequence then broke this expectation of mine. Instead of searching ways to stay in contact Takaki goes full hopeless writing emo messages to himself while completely ignoring Sumida a girl who fell in love with him. I GET THE VERY BLATANT MESSAGE MR. SHINKAI! But come on Takaki were in his 1718's at the time. When did Takaki and Akari stopped sending mails to eachother? Why didn't they change numbers? And if Takaki was so goddamn in love couldn't he visit Akari... like in the summer? If their love was truly impossible to be fulfilled then this desperation of Takaki were justified. But I feel like it wasnt and otherwise real and deep emotions regarding love felt like teenage angst and selfpitying. This organically carried on to the third sequence. Thats where realism finally kicked in while Takaki was still deep in depression Akari lived her life on getting engaged and stuff. And when they met again at the intersection I was so glad Takaki didn't run after Akari but let her go  the only sensible thing he had done since sequence one.Overall it's a good onehour movie and a mustsee for the visuals. The plot however is very lacking in some aspects making very hard to live up to the emotions 5CPS intended to induce.".

The film is beautiful yet the viewers can't help but notice a hint of sadness as the film progresses to the third chapter.The melodies that play throughout the film also compliments the scenes well but not overpower the scene.Some viewers may find the first chapter to be a little strange especially when today's technology weren't as big as it was 1020 years ago.

	schema:reviewBody "Having been impressed by Makoto Shinkai's earlier works and having heard good things about this I was keen to see it having finally watched it I must say that I was not disappointed! While it doesn't feature the science fiction elements of those stories it has a greater emotional depth and the backgrounds are absolutely stunning I can't think of any animation where they looked so good. The film is broken up into three episodes each taking place at a slightly different time in the life of Takaki Tono.In the first episode Takaki has formed a close friendship with Akari a girl in his class. When her parents move she transfers to a school in a distant town it looks as if their friendship might be over but one day Takaki takes the train to visit her. Much of the episode takes place as he is on the train which is getting further and further behind schedule because of the heavy snow.The second story takes place a few years later and Takaki is his final year of high school he isn't the star of this segment though that honour goes to Kanae a girl in his class who has fallen in love with him but can't bring herself to tell him how she feels.The third story finds Takaki working in a job he doesn't particularly enjoy and still thinks of Akari although he has long since lost touch with her meanwhile Akari is preparing to get married. One day the two of them pass as the walk over a level crossing Takaki turns to look as two trains pass will she be looking from the other side when the trains have passed? The story itself might not be deep but it is touching and beautifully told feeling far more real than most live action stories. The imagery is stunning it contains an incredible amount of detail including many reflective objects that I imagine would be a real challenge to create. If you are a fan of anime or animation in general this is a must see.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.".

Why on earth is this a bad thing? Sure parts of the movie rate an 11 out of 10 on the cheeseometer but once again why is this a bad thing?

Why on earth is this a bad thing? Sure parts of the movie rate an 11 out of 10 on the cheeseometer but once again why is this a bad thing?

This movie was a delight for kids  we were in a packed theater in San Francisco well actually Daly City and the room was halffull of very young kids. Their spontaneous laughter at the slightest nonsense throughout the film was in its own way musical. And these reactions without any potty humor. I had never seen Rock in a movie and barely knew who he was. But I do know Julie Andrews and Billy Crystal and those two are enough to establish the picture's bona fides as cinema. The movie has enough site gags and silly talk to keep the kids involved and enough in it to let the accompanying adults enjoy the moment too. It was cartoonish in execution and this without the typical special effects hammers usually found in fantasy movies. I enjoyed the hockey scenes loved that every bad act had a satisfying response.I do have to laugh at some of the critics who apparently expect Ingmar Bergman touches in all movies and frown on any nonpolitical movie that doesn't need subtitles at least to Englishspeakers. Note to the humorless this is not high art and was not intended to be. It was a fun and funny sendup of what happens if you let cynicism govern your life and the rewards of reform.Go!

He plays Derek Thompson a hockey player known as the Tooth Fairy because he knocks a lot of teeth out. He has a girlfriend played by Ashley Judd why her I don't know because it is a very minor role whom has 2 kids. One night Derek almost slips up and tells the young daughter there is no tooth fairy. But her mom saves the day. That night Derek is summoned to fairy land and in a unique way is given things for fairies to use and trained to fly. I liked this part the best. Billy Crystal cameos as Jimmy the fairy whom gives him the shrinking paste fairy dust etc... Amnesia dust is great.So Derek is sentenced to 2 weeks as a tooth fairy by the head fairy Julie Andrews. Of course he learns valuable lessons over this time.I also liked the parts where he goes into people's homes in various ways. It was funny we all need invisible spray.FINAL VERDICT I liked it and recommend it.".

He started as a skill player a dangler an offensive prospect that had his dreams dashed by a shoulder injury and he's now happy to play a couple of minutes a night hammer the opponents' star player and spend the rest of the game in his custom recliner in the penalty box. He's a cartoon pragmatist dispensing hard truths about the impossibility of dreams coming true to young hockey players wanting to be just like him.As a result he is summoned to Fairyland and sentenced by head fairy Lily Julie Andrews to two weeks' duty as a Tooth Fairy a realdeal winged creeper with a batbelt full of spy gadgets and a lanky awkward case worker with fairy aspirations of his own Stephen Merchant cocreator with Ricky Gervais of The Office. Lessons are learned a whole bunch of obvious groaner gags are hatched and everything eventually from a guitarist kid's fear of failure to a single mom's love to a future hockey star's cockiness and on and on is resolved in a Really Pleasant Way.It's a kids movie pure and simple endlessly saccharine and full of pratfalls Healthy Moral Lessons and magic fairy dust. It's also incredibly dull and a massive waste of what's actually a great cast  Merchant is consistently funny and Billy Crystal is in vintage form as Fairyland's gadgetmaster Q equivalent and Johnson is as charming as ever. Six year old kids will probably laugh their six year old heads off but the dullness of the script the predictability of the gags and the moral convenience and simplicity of the story is going to bore anybody not actually invested in the ok wait is there actually a tooth fairy or not dad debate.You want this film to be better just because it could have been.

It is going to accomplish its ostensibly stated goal entertaining children but outside of a few laughs here and there it's not going to do much for anyone else. 410".

She was alternately stern sympathetic but completely in charge of a chaotic operation.My wife and I saw this with our seven yearold daughter and haven't laughed so much since seeing Space Balls more than 20 years ago. TOOTHFAIRY was a wonderful delight.";

But when he nearly tells the daughter of a woman he's dating Ashley Judd what he thinks of that fairy tale he gets summoned by a caseworker named Tracy Stephen Merchant to the head of Tooth Fairyland Julie Andrews for a two week penance of becoming one. Billy Crystal shows up as someone who provides all the material to become the tooth fairy. I'll stop there and just say there's some funny moments between Crystal and Johnson and quite a few with the former Rock and this Tracy person. And Andrews brings some stern yet gentle authority to her role. And there are some good lessons for the kiddies in the audience. So in summation no great shakes but Tooth Fairy is okay filler for 90 or so minutes...".

	schema:reviewBody "So this is not a great movie and it will never be mistaken for one. I'd agree with that assessment. But it is kind of cute and it is very silly and when you look at it as a movie that's basically there to appeal to kids because there's really nothing in it for adults you have to at least concede that cute and silly is not a bad combination for a kids movie. So this may not be great but it's not really bad in that it serves its purpose it's a kidfriendly movie. Nothing wrong with that.Now from an adult's point of view the story which revolves around hockey player Derek Thompson  played by Dwayne The Rock Johnson  being sentenced to work as a tooth fairy for a couple of weeks as punishment for disseminating disbelief is pretty lame and the performances are generally forgettable. I was completely unconvinced of the need for the hockey angle and frankly it was done badly. The on ice action was poorly portrayed although the scene in which Thompson takes his revenge on the 18 year old whiz kid  Ryan Sheckler  was pretty funny and really how could Thompson play 9 seasons without a single shot? 9 seasons without a goal maybe but this guy seemed to get enough ice time at least as an enforcer and bodyguard for his team's better players so somewhere along the lines he's going to pick up the odd rebound and get a shot.This is mildly humorous every now and then and considering how silly it really is it has some surprisingly recognizable faces in the cast  including Julie Andrews and Billy Crystal. I'd give it a 410  but it's not a bad choice to sit down and watch this with your kids.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time when 'The Rock' Dwayne Johnson turned into a fairy wearing that pink frock or dress with wings I was howling with laughter. This man was one of my favourites when I used to watch WWE. He was so strong menacing and seemed to be so bad and angry all the time. Then he made his foray into Hollywood and he was one of those rare WWE stars who actually had a charm about them. Nobody was more surprised than me when he started to do only Disney kind of films. I didn't think he would last long but this guy has made it big in PG movies. He truly convinces us that he is not the badass he was made out to be during his wrestling career and he is so genuinely charming. He is not embarrassed to make a fool out of himself and I think he really likes children. He carries the movie on his able shoulders with some help from other good actors. One constant thing about his movies is that he is a jerk in the beginning who goes on to be a good guy in the end. That may sound boring and tiring but Dwayne Johnson is genuinely funny in comedic moments and moves our heart in sad situations. So I like him as an actor and I hope he continues to make these kinds of family entertainers.Derek Thompson Dwayne Johnson is a local Ice Hockey player who is quite a celebrity and is nicknamed 'The Toothfairy' for his defending prowess on the field. But he is getting older and younger players are gaining more attention. One of them in particular Mick Donnelly is rubbing his face in the fact that he is going somewhere in his life and Derek will be a nobody. Derek has a girlfriend Carly Ashley Judd who has two kids  a girl and a boy. When the girl's tooth breaks she is excited about the real toothfairy who will take away her tooth and place a dollar under the pillow. Derek doesn't believe one should have dreams as it is highly unlikely that one will achieve their dreams and ultimately will be unhappy. So he tries to give it straight to her that there are no fairies or any of the other imaginary creatures. Carly saves her daughter from the horrible truth and chides Derek for his stupidity. That night Derek receives a summons from 'The Department of Dissemination of Disbelief' from the Toothfairy Land. He is thrusted upon the job of a toothfairy for two weeks with a threat to extend the punishment if he doesn't do it with the spirit of a toothfairy. When Derek finds out it wasn't a dream his life changes drastically.What were you expecting when you sat down to see this movie? Citizen Kane?! Just enjoy the movie for what it is and stop grumbling about the inconsistencies of the movie. Hollywood is obsessed in making movies for kids which are way too sweet and saccharine and totally unreal. Though the premise of this movie about a man getting the job of a fairy is also unreal it is actually quite good. The kids though cute are not exactly over the top sweet. The movie as with all kid movies has the moral that one should dream and not get dragged down by others who tell you that you are no good. Dwayne Johnson is believable as the jerk somewhat sensitive but still a jerk and the transformed good hearted man. I really liked the scene where Derek imitates Dracula for the little girl there are lots of sweet moments. The boy is a normal kid who doesn't have interest in anything other than music and girls. He doesn't like Derek but Derek makes a deal with the boy to impress Carly. The toothfairy kit he's given with the invisible spray and amnesia dust among other things is cool. Tracy Stephen Merchant the caseworker in Toothfairy Land is also funny but I must say Julie Andrews is wasted as the fairy Godmother. I saw this with my younger cousins and they absolutely loved it. Recommended to everyone who like the Disney movies of this genre.710".

	schema:reviewBody "TOOTH FAIRY. The exwrestler and action movie star formerly known as The Rock has turned to making kiddie friendly films. The rot started with Disney's The Game Plan so I was not sure what to expect from his latest film Tooth Fairy. But it was surprisingly enjoyable. Dwayne Johnson plays Derek Thompson a minor league ice hockey player who has earned the nickname The Tooth Fairy because of his aggressive style of play that often leaves opposition players bleeding a missing a tooth. But Derek is something of a cynic and he ruthlessly crushed the dreams of many young fans asking for advice. But when he tells his girl friend's young daughter that there is no such thing as the tooth fairy he is in for a rude awakening. He is summonsed to Fairy Land and sentenced to serve two weeks as a real tooth fairy. He is issued with his own wand wings and blue tights which lead to some embarrassing moments for the macho man. Derek is shown the rules of his job by his handler Tracy Stephen Merchant from the UK version of The Office etc who himself yearns to become a fairy one day. At first Derek is reluctant to take his role seriously but eventually he warms to his task and by the end of his tenure he is a changed man and has even rediscovered his own forgotten dreams. Thompson also has to deal with the brash young new star of his hockey team played by skateboarding champ Ryan Scheckler with whom he establishes a rivalry. A number of writers have fashioned the screenplay but it has been further polished by veterans Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel the pair whose previous films include Night Shift Splash City Slickers etc. While it may not be their best effort it does provide some cheap laughs and a few good gags. The sight of Johnson in wings and a tutu is quite funny. In the past Johnson has shown himself to be both a good sport and quite adept at light comedy with roles in films like Be Cool and Get Smart that allow him to play against type. Who else would you cast as the stern but ultimately softhearted fairy godmother but Julie Andrews? She is perfectly cast here and is wonderfully prim and proper and straight laced and her appearance helps us swallow this premise. Billy Crystal also has a small role as the provider of various potions that Derek may find useful. He is to fairies what Q is to James Bond but he has rarely been this funny for ages. Director Michael Lembeck is a veteran of television but he has also directed the two Santa Clause sequels and is familiar with this mix of fantasy and wish fulfillment. Tooth Fairy delivers some positive messages about the importance of dreams and childhood innocence amongst the laughs and the special effects. It's a film that holds something to appeal for all ages.".

Tooth Fairy delivers some positive messages about the importance of dreams and childhood innocence amongst the laughs and the special effects. It's a film that holds something to appeal for all ages.";

Billy Crystal was very funny and it reminded me just how much I miss his humor. It was surprising to see Seth Macfarlane in a real family movie but he was quite funny and believable in his role.I really enjoy watching Judge Judy so I giggled quite a bit as Julie Andrews take on her role was quite similar to Judge Judy. ie when she was giving Derrick a hard time for interrupting her. We saw this as a family laughed as a family and talked about the real point of the movie as a family. I can't imagine anyone involved in the making of this movie who isn't proud. They should be as they completely hit the mark! I would love to see many more movies like this for our family to see.".

The former WWE wrestler plays a grumpy selfcentered minorleague hockey player who shatters the dreams of children as casually and decisively as he knocks the teeth out of his opponents on the ice. Never stop believing in your dreams qualifies as the theme of this incredibly vibrant clever PGrated comedy for kids. Indeed the public has bestowed on him the nickname 'the Tooth Fairy' because teeth fly when Derek Thompson slams into an adversary. Our hero goes too far when he informs a little girl in no uncertain terms that the Tooth Fairy is nothing but a figment of her imagination. Consequently our protagonist wakes up the next day to find a summons from the Department of Dissemination of Disbelief under his pillow. This wonderfully frivolous but wholesomely entertaining 106minute supernatural fluff never squanders a second and the Rock is at his charismatic best. Although the producers have surrounded him with a worthwhile cast The Tooth Fairy belongs to the Rock and his wattage burns up the screen. Picking up teeth from sleepy urchins proves more challenging than Derek had imagined. Derek Thompson Dwayne Johnson of Race to Witch Mountain blew his shoulder out playing pro hockey and wound up in the minor leagues skating with the Lansing Michigan Ice Wolves. Despite being in top physical condition Derek is getting a little long in the tooth. Meaning he has settled into a comfortable niche and is taking it too easy. He loves to crush the dreams of youngsters largely because he has sacrificed his own dream about serious hockey career. He has taken the easy way out and converted himself into a freak sideshow attraction. When his young fans ask him about their chances of becoming a sports sensation he deflates their dreams and suggests they lower their expectations so they won't feel bad with the inevitable happens. While this makes Derek appear callous the veteran hockey star reflects his way of dealing with his own predicament. He hasn't scored a goal in nine years and he hasn't tried because he has sold out to become a clown. When he isn't knocking out teeth Derek is dating Carly Ashley Judd of High Crimes. She has two kids Tess adorable newcomer Destiny Whitlock her preschool daughter and Randy Chase Ellison of Wristcutters A Love Story her junior high son. One evening Carly entrusts Tess to Derek's care. Derek and his teammates are playing poker. Derek comes up short on cash and steals the money under Tess' pillow left there for her tooth by the Tony Fairy. Tess who has rhapsodized about the tooth fairy awakens and cannot find her money. Derek assures her that the tooth fairy doesn't exist. Carly pretends to find the missing cash gives it to a jubilant Tess and glowers at Derek. The next thing Derek knows he is in Tooth Fairy Kingdom facing the Tooth Fairy Godmother Lily Julie Andrews of The Sound of Music who sentences him to two weeks of retrieving teeth. In other words at some inopportune time when he is play hockey Derek receives a summons to fetch teeth. Sulking Derek sets about paying the penalty for eroding the dreams of youth and finds himself in several adventures. Although he has wings Derek doesn't fly because he has no confidence in himself. Complicating matters are Carly and company. Carly wants Derek to bond with Randy who suffers from a severe inferiority complex. Initially Derek handles this situation well. He buys Randy a brandnew electric guitar and he jams with Randy on his drums in preparation for a junior high talent contest. About that time the Ice Wolves pick up a hotshot new player Mick Donnelly Ryan Sheckler of Grind who won't being staying long because he likes to score goals and scores them often. The Ice Wolves coach assigns Derek to watch out for Mick.Meantime Derek has to learn the ropes about being a Tooth Fairy. Lilly assigns a tall willowy fairy without wings Tracy 6foot7inch British comedian Stephen Merchant of The Office TV show to serve as his caseworker. Derek reports to Jerry Billy Crystal of Mr. Saturday Night an elderly whitehaired pixie who supplies him with a variety of items essential in his line of work. He carries items that are reminiscent of MenInBlack. Among these items are shrinking paste amnesia dust and invisibility spray. The shrinking paste enables him to literally shrink himself down so he can escape except when he encounters a giant cat. When he enters a house or apartment he can sprinkle amnesia dust of the occupants and they will never remember his visit and finally he has an aerosol can of invisibility spray that he can cover himself with so he cannot be seen. Predictably Derek winds up changing his ways and learning important lessons about life that he has shied away from like taking the shot to score.The Tooth Fairy is as consistently hilarious as it is inspirational. Dwayne Johnson and Stephen Merchant make a fantastic twosome with Merchant forever beaming at the disgruntled sports star. Connie and Carla director Michael Lembeck and a quintet of scenarists among them Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz of City Slickers Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia of Surviving Christmas and Randi Mayem Singer of Mrs. Doubtfire have conjured up an exhilarating little comedy that is bolstered by a topnotch supporting cast including Ashley Judd Julie Andrews Billy Crystal and Stephen Merchant. The verbal humor is far above average too with clever witticisms. This warm fuzzy predictable fishoutofwater epic will appeal to adults too with several genuinely sidesplitting laughs.".

	schema:headline " Just refuses to admit it's a Bmovie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me open with what any film review should address I did not enjoy this movie. But first a disclaimer despite my reasons I want to assure you that none of my negative points will verbally lambast lead actor Taylor Lautner just because 'he's some guy from Twilight.' Nor will I make scalding reference to his gratuitous lack of upper body wear the kind that one would hope comes off as witty commentary but ends up sounding more like an awkward combination of contempt and jealousy. So with that out of the way let's get started.When the shy but shorttempered Nathan Lautner is paired up with girl next door Karen Lily Collins for a school research assignment he is shocked to find an image of his younger self on a 'missing persons' website prompting him to question everything he thought was normal about his life. When the cover is blown he and Karen find themselves on the run unable to trust anyone in their search for the truth.Not only will I not target any more of this review towards Lautner personally I will even concede that he does his best on what is otherwise a sinking ship from the opening scene. Naturally his acting skills do need refinement and I expect we're not looking at the next De Niro here but his occasionally lackluster delivery is simply a branch of a much bigger problem the script.As an unapologetic actioner it should be expected that Abduction possesses some of the clunky dialogue clichs associated with the genre. These include but are not limited to 'trust has to be earned' 'I'm not leaving without her' and perennial favourite 'waithow do you know my name?' which is actually used more than once. But among these tired expressions is a handful of headscratchers lines intended to act as cool quips but possessing an undoubtedly cringeworthy aftertaste. For example after Gerry Sigourney Weaver helps Nathan escape using balloons to cover security cameras a la Ocean's Eleven she releases them with the deadpan utterly serious line of 'I hate balloons'. So you see my point.The set pieces are just as ludicrous asking the viewer to buy into the movie too much when we have not been given any reason to engage with the plot in the first place. In one instance we bear witness to a CIA agent operating undercover as a suburban housewife easily take out two trained assassins. The climax set at a baseball game is a storytelling train wreck fraught with inconsistencies and overly convenient outcomes. At the very least I hoped a film set in Pittsburgh would show some love for the mighty Steelers instead of the lowly Pirates but I digress.General flaws in logic and realism are other aspects that can be attributed to this type of movie without having them become a major concern. Often we tend to overlook moments which would result in serious injury for the hero in real life simply because he's just that a hero. I'm also willing to pass these moments off but in Abduction they occur so often and on such a noticeable scale that they severely detract from any engagement with the film that could be developed as it progresses and therein lies its greatest letdown.I commend the satisfactory action scenes which minimised the kind of closeup rapid camera movement that has drawn the bulk of my ire in recent months. Also I was pleased to see the film show a bit of gumption by avoiding an entirely happy allswellthatendswell conclusion but these upsides are not enough to sweeten what is otherwise an inherently flawed film.There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsisiprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.".

But first a disclaimer despite my reasons I want to assure you that none of my negative points will verbally lambast lead actor Taylor Lautner just because 'he's some guy from Twilight.' Nor will I make scalding reference to his gratuitous lack of upper body wear the kind that one would hope comes off as witty commentary but ends up sounding more like an awkward combination of contempt and jealousy. So with that out of the way let's get started.When the shy but shorttempered Nathan Lautner is paired up with girl next door Karen Lily Collins for a school research assignment he is shocked to find an image of his younger self on a 'missing persons' website prompting him to question everything he thought was normal about his life. When the cover is blown he and Karen find themselves on the run unable to trust anyone in their search for the truth.Not only will I not target any more of this review towards Lautner personally I will even concede that he does his best on what is otherwise a sinking ship from the opening scene. Naturally his acting skills do need refinement and I expect we're not looking at the next De Niro here but his occasionally lackluster delivery is simply a branch of a much bigger problem the script.As an unapologetic actioner it should be expected that Abduction possesses some of the clunky dialogue clichs associated with the genre. These include but are not limited to 'trust has to be earned' 'I'm not leaving without her' and perennial favourite 'waithow do you know my name?' which is actually used more than once. But among these tired expressions is a handful of headscratchers lines intended to act as cool quips but possessing an undoubtedly cringeworthy aftertaste. For example after Gerry Sigourney Weaver helps Nathan escape using balloons to cover security cameras a la Ocean's Eleven she releases them with the deadpan utterly serious line of 'I hate balloons'. So you see my point.The set pieces are just as ludicrous asking the viewer to buy into the movie too much when we have not been given any reason to engage with the plot in the first place. In one instance we bear witness to a CIA agent operating undercover as a suburban housewife easily take out two trained assassins. The climax set at a baseball game is a storytelling train wreck fraught with inconsistencies and overly convenient outcomes. At the very least I hoped a film set in Pittsburgh would show some love for the mighty Steelers instead of the lowly Pirates but I digress.General flaws in logic and realism are other aspects that can be attributed to this type of movie without having them become a major concern. Often we tend to overlook moments which would result in serious injury for the hero in real life simply because he's just that a hero. I'm also willing to pass these moments off but in Abduction they occur so often and on such a noticeable scale that they severely detract from any engagement with the film that could be developed as it progresses and therein lies its greatest letdown.I commend the satisfactory action scenes which minimised the kind of closeup rapid camera movement that has drawn the bulk of my ire in recent months. Also I was pleased to see the film show a bit of gumption by avoiding an entirely happy allswellthatendswell conclusion but these upsides are not enough to sweeten what is otherwise an inherently flawed film.There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsisiprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.";

	schema:headline " Bland action thriller that tries but fails to be the younger Bourne no thanks to Taylor Lautner's hammy acting";
	schema:reviewBody "Five minutes. That was how long it took before Taylor Lautner took his shirt off in his purportedly gritty action thriller 'Abduction' and depending on how you took to that fact you may find yourself enjoying every minute of it or cringing in disbelief. Right from the start this Taylormade vehicle makes no excuses for being a breakout role for the 'Twilight' star after all if Team Edward or Robert Pattinson can do it then there's no reason why Team Jacob can't do likewise.Nonetheless it seems that Team Jacob should have just stayed in the woods of Forks Washington for this insipid Bournewannabe does him nor his fans no favours. Rather and we may be risking our life and limb by saying this it only demonstrates his limitations as an actor especially since he practically recycles the same angsty broody expression throughout the film that he had already put forth umpteen times in the 'Twilight' movies. And no being a teenager who discovers that the people you call 'mother' and 'father' aren't in fact your real parents isn't much of an excuse too. That's the predicament Lautner's character Nathan finds himself in one day after stumbling across a website with photos of missing children and using some software to approximate what one of those kids could look like as a teenager. Though that's the very premise of the movie the least we expected was for debut feature film screenwriter Shawn Christensen to come up with a better lead in than just some stupid research assignment Nathan and his girl next door Karen Lily Collins daughter of singer Phil was assigned to work together on. Logic and coherence are however too much evidently to demand as one would have to suspend both to believe that Nathan is suddenly at the centre of global espionage with both the good guys led by 'Spiderman 2's' Alfred Molina and the bad guys led by Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist from 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' in pursuit. Apparently Nathan is the son of a top secret CIA undercover operative whose 'parents' Jason Isaacs and Maria Bello are fellow CIA agents sent to protect him while his father is away. As with all chases the aim is for something that Nathan has in his possession some encrypted code with the names of dirty CIA agents. It takes almost half an hour before the action kicks in the introduction that sets up Nathan's adolescent issues and his secret highschool crush on Karen pure tedium that is definitely not director John Singleton's forte. Thankfully the pace picks up considerably once Nathan is thrust into that implausible situation with Singleton clearly at ease setting up the film's various action sequences. One of the first that sees Nathan's 'parents' murdered is shot and edited for maximum thrills and the climax set in a packed stadium with a live baseball match also packs suspense. To Lautner's credit the action also looks good because he performs most if not all of the stunts by himself whether tackling a bigger sized guy MMAstyle or fleeing from the bad guys with parkour. Singleton doesn't go for the shakycam technique allowing his audience to appreciate Lautner's physicality in its full glory. Even so taking on the lead role requires Lautner to perform some serious acting in order for us to identify with his character's inner distress but the square jawed actor with his onenote performance fails to inspire any empathy. The fault doesn't lie with Lautner entirely to appeal to the teenage demographic which the producers are relying on to turn up for this movie they have decided to amp up the obligatory romance between Nathan and Karen even to the extent of letting the two teenage characters engage in some heavy makingout that stops just before it crosses the PG13 boundary. It is distracting and laughable although the latter seems to be in line with most of the awful dialogue in the film. Not even veteran stars like Isaacs Bello Molina Nyqvist and Sigourney Weaver who plays Nathan's psychologist can redeem this atbest made forTV thriller that tries to be the younger version of the Bourne series. So as much as Team Jacob may wish for Lautner to be their Matt Damon or even Tom Cruise it is clear from his debut headlining movie that once the 'Twilight' phenomenon fades the same can probably be said of Lautner's acting career as well. www.moviexclusive.com".

He realises that his parents Maria Bello and Jason Isaacs are not his own and that his life is a lie. As Nathan starts to search for his true identity and his biological parents he is being targeted by a team of rogue agents forcing him to flee with his neighbor Karen Lily Collins. He begins to realize that his fabricated life is hiding a dangerous truth.In writing this screenplay I suspect that writers Shawn Christensen and Jeffrey Nachmanoff must have pieced together ideas from The Bourne Identity and the recent Hanna  and come out with this harebrained plot. But the truth could be that director John Singleton and the filmmakers do not really care about the plot they just want an excuse to show heartthrob Lautner and Collins on the run from some baddies who included Swedish icon Michael Nyqvist of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in order to film some action sequences.Indeed many films have gotten away with idiotic plots  provided they have stars that audiences could root for. Alas Lautner seems incapable of having more than a couple of expressions and he can't act to save his life. Neither can Collins despite the strong support of veterans like Sigourney Weaver as Nathan's shrink and Alfred Molina as a CIA exec. All through the first half Singleton keeps the audience wondering why Nathan is being chased and in the second half his aim is probably to keep them from walking out of the cineplex.

	schema:headline " Lautner Cannot Carry an Action Film";
	schema:reviewBody "I was excited when I saw the cast. Listen to the actors involved in this production. There's Sigourney Weaver Alfred Molina Jason Isaacs Michael Nyqvist and Maria Bello. Okay so there's also Taylor Lautner in the lead role as well as Lily Collins as his sidekick but I was hopeful that the supporting cast could allow it to be a worthwhile watch. For a while I actually believed that Abduction could be a good film.Even the first 20 minutes or so weren't that bad. We watched Nathan Lautner and his friends go to a party and get drunk. He wakes up the next morning hungover and stripped of his shirt. Those of you who have seen the Twilight films are probably used to seeing Lautner without a shirt on but surprisingly it stays on his person for the majority of this film. Nathan goes home to find out that his father Jason Isaacs wants to have a boxing session so they fight and it's enjoyable. It's especially fun because the younger of the two gets beaten up quite a bit. He's also grounded for a week because he didn't call home. How adorable.We watch the young Nathan go to school and get assigned a project to work on with his neighbor Karen Collins. Their project has something to do with missing children or maybe just people in general it's not really elaborated on. When looking at one website they see a child that looks remarkably similar to Nathan. They do a digital reconstruction of what the child might look like now and it's almost a perfect match. Then they look closer at the younger photo and they see that the shirt the child is wearing is the same on that Nathan had as a kid. It even has the same stain on the right shoulder. Weird right?Well apparently not. This was a trap and Nathan fell right into it. Things happen which I won't spoil a little bit of Spy Kids action goes on in regards to Nathan's parents and eventually Nathan and Lilly end up on the run from not one but two parties. The first claims to be the CIA and is led by Alfred Molina while the second is a bunch of Russian guys led by Michael Nyqvist. Can the pair trust anyone? Will they get out alive? Who knows but more importantly does anyone care?I certainly didn't. Nathan was as bland as you might expect a Taylor Lautner character to be played. He's your typical teenager  shy around girls loves playing video games and hanging out with friends  and yet he is an amazing athlete and could easily be the most popular person at the school. He also has weird dreams which he explains to his shrink Sigourney Weaver and that's about as deep as his personality gets.What's strange about director John Singleton's picture is that he seems to think his characters are deep and that we deserve to spend a lot of time with them when they're not doing anything. The plot doesn't really kick in until maybe the half hour mark and even after we do start to roll there are points when characters will stop just to chat and let us get to know them  all the bland lifeless them that there is to know.His friend Karen isn't much better. She basically serves no purpose except to give Nathan someone to talk to throughout and even when it would be intelligent to leave her so that she can be safe he doesn't because well I'm not really sure. She protests against going home although she's not the target anyway. He is because there's a list that his father  his real father anyway as it turns out that Isaacs' character wasn't really his dad  stole that everyone else wants. There's more to the list than just that but it serves as the MacGuffin to drive the plot.Whether or not Taylor Lautner makes a good action star will depend entirely on how you see him and whether or not you can believe it. Personally I didn't think he had it in him but if you're a big fan you'll probably overlook any of his flaws anyway. I can say that he desperately struggled with the more dramatic scenes line delivery or even acting like a normal human being whenever he wasn't being chased.What gets to me most is how poorly the established actors were used. Weaver gets three scenes total I believe Nyqvist is always just in the background except for one scene during a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game which comes close to being the sole highlight while Molina plays basically the same character as Nyqvist being used in the same way Poorly. If Abduction goes to prove anything it's that Lautner cannot carry an action film alone.This would still all be okay if the action was entertaining but it just isn't. The action scenes follow this sort of pattern Fist fight car chase fist fight car chase. Rinse and repeat as often as you can in the remaining hour and change after the plot kicks in and I've basically described the entire movie. Well there are those scenes when the characters and the audience get a break but they end up dragging us down because the actors involved in them don't make us believe in their characters.Abduction is terrible especially given how talented the supporting cast members are. But Lautner can't carry this film the secondary actors are all underutilized while the writing and action scenes were all lackluster. The plot doesn't even make complete sense with things needing exposition being ignored and things easily understood given all of the time. Unless you want to watch Taylor Lautner being chased around for 100 minutes you have no reason to spend your time with Abduction.".

There are so many talented actors out there serving tables and this guy is getting massive salaries to do what he obviously does worst... act! This was a B minus film not worth the admission fee or the 2 hours you will waste watching it! I wonder what the budget of this film was? the money would have been better used if given to starving children or me! go to a gym if your interested in hot bodies go to the movies if you want a good film or so the theory goes...";

Nothing made sense the acting was terrible and half the scenes were painful to watch. The action was decent at best and the romance was a joke. The entire theater which was quite full was dying from laughter throughout the entire film. If you thought the trailer looked bad the rest of the film is worse.As I mentioned nothing seemed to make sense. The characters travel from Pittsburgh to Virginia to halfway to Nebraska then back to Pittsburgh all in about a day but I'm not even sure if that's correct because nothing is ever made clear or explained. We see scenes begin to unravel then suddenly they jump forward in time with no explanation. For example Karen Lily Collins is tied up in a room. We see her knock a glass cup off a counter and it shatters. She starts kicking the broken glass towards her hands which are tied up around a chair leg but then we cut back to Nathan Taylor Lautner who is fighting some Russian guy and suddenly she shows up in the doorway. What happened?? How did she cut herself loose?? And this isn't just a one time thing  it happens all throughout the film! Who made them lunch in the caf? It was empty!! And who put the gun under his seat at the stadium?!Film flubs aside the acting is terrible. Karen is decent but Nathan is a joke. Even Sigourney Weaver sounds like she's reading the lines off the script. The only time we ever hear even a small dose of emotion from her is the very end of the film. Any moment that was supposed to be taken seriously was ruined by the acting and the film's attempt to be cool. Most the humor was topical Justin Bieber jokes Facebook references and the romance plot was pathetic. All in all this movie was BAD. The action was alright but if you want to see an action film go watch something else. The romance was dumb. The acting was mostly awful and the story was subpar. If you want a good laugh then by all means go see this movie! Otherwise don't even bother.Oh and can someone PLEASE explain to me how it was late evening in Pittsburgh PA but it was midafternoon in London??!?!!?".

The only highlight of the show was seeing Taylor Lautner acting as a normal high school kid instead of a werewolf. But still sad to say his acting had no charisma at all.

First quarter of the movie was still fine but then it started to get cheesy.... There were so many loopholes in the movie and it just feels like the script and plot were very poorly planned. I sense sloppy work there. I left the theatre feeling so bewildered. So you might sayit's just a movie.... not everything makes sense But comparing to big actionspy movie names like Bourne Mission Impossible and Die Hard which have delivered an excellent movie experiences which leaves you at the edge of your seat Abduction feels more like a chickflick packed with more action or maybe a budget action film. It's very subtle.The parts I enjoyed in the movie was the presence of veterans like Sigourney Weaver Mario Bello and my favourite Jason Isaacs who plays Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films. They are always a joy to have and see in movies. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. Unless you just want to see Taylor Lautner I would rather you give this show a miss.

Even though the movie has lots of talented cast like Mario Bello Jason Issacs Sigourney Weaver Alfred Molina  the movie and the poster squarely focuses on Taylor Lautner. The red carpet talk was about his martial arts background and the numerous cuts and bruises everyone had suffered during the filming process. I was expecting an stunt based action oriented movie even more by the talk and comparisons made to the Bourne Identity Matt Damon and Mission Impossible Tom Cruise.First and foremost the writing is sloppy the story is riddled with weak dialog and clichs tones changes on a whim  there isn't much more to the plot than what's given in the trailer  a missing children website leading to the world of guns secret agents CIAs etc etc. This movie continues a trend in modern CSICIAcrime writing a lack of understanding of the basic principles of technology and I guess it won't bother most people but for me the whole plot seemed rather forced.The most disappointing thing was that the action never felt like a high grade action movie. The much vaunted stunts came out as weak and the fights were just basic Bmovie stuff that would have been acceptable in an early 90s action movie. There are no big car chases and the big stadium final setpiece is bit anticlimatic since the writing couldn't cover up the basic lack of oomph in it. This is even more surprising since the director John Singleton's last movie is the ultraviolent Four Brothers.The man Taylor Lautner himself does his thing and manages to not look like turning into a werewolf every time. He doesn't impress with his acting or his martial arts which begs on why he didn't insist on a full team of martial arts coaches and stuntmen to make this movie into his action star vehicle. Lily Collins as Nathan's love interest looks a bit plain jane and has no personality and doesn't quite create the chemistry with Taylor Lautner. The train kissing scene which we were told would leave many a girls jealous feels more voyeuristic and uncomfortable than jealousyinducing explosive.I hate to say it but it feels like a quick cash in on Taylor Lautner's name and fame. Everything is so undercooked and cheap feeling with numerous blatant and obtrusive product placements that it's just a big dupe to get the Twilight fans and teenager's ticket sales before anyone realizes that this isn't a good movie.".

It was so bad that after I was done watching it my head was spinning with confusion.The reason I was so confused was because I did not know what I had just watched. I had hoped it would be a fun movie AT LEAST comedy action romance. But it was instead a mishmash of nonsense. NOTHING and I mean NOTHING made sense in this movie the setup the character motivations the characters themselves the time frame the plot twists the ending.So the setup is that this guy is not sure if his parents are his real parents. Is this guy stupid!? He looks NOTHING like EITHER of them! Wow! His skin is darker than them too! And what a cheap way for him to happen upon this website that shows him he was adopted. It was a class assignment! Wow!Now to the character motivations. So these two adoptive parents spent THEIR WHOLE LIVES to kept this kid secret so that some list would not get out? They died for that? And this guy who was adopted what does he care? His fake parents are loving and he is living a great life!Now the characters themselves. How in the HELL can this adopted guy NOT have the CONFIDENCE to talk to this unibrowed girl? He is beyond in shape happy social on teams etc... But he is awkward with the ladies? Huh? And what's so special about this girl? Also when they killed his adoptive parents how did no one come to help? This seems like a wealthy neighborhood. They have NO security!? NO ONE cares? You'd think that TWO CIA agents would invest in SOME kind of security. They raised this kid! They have had just about TWO DECADES to prepare for this. But did they? No. None of these people make sense.Time frame this movie after the adoptive parents are killed seems to take place in two days. They sleep near some river then the rest of the movie takes place in daylight. During the credits we see the guy and the girl limping off into the sunset. OK... so they ran away to a hospital then went to some house then on a train  going where? It's never really explained. Then it's like noon in the stadium they run around and suddenly a couple of HOURS have passed. Can't be more than an hour. Not much occurs as the whole thing was a chase then a small convo so it's fast.Now to the so called plot twists. I put them in quotations since there really is no plot for this movie. Check the summary on IMDb it just DESCRIBES the first half of the movie! All that happens in this movie is that it jumps from one insane thing to another. First we think this guy is a daredevil. Next we see he is a drunk. Next we are told he can't talk to girls. Now we are led to believe he is a nice guy. Then he becomes a target for a worldwide conspiracy. He could not even defeat his adoptive father but now we must believe he can kick  and take names. Earlier in the movie the girl tells the guy that she is not doing all the work for the group project. Meaning he is a stupid slacker but we are next to believe that he is a master of mind games and ruffing it. We are to believe that he can outwit and outrun the CIA the police professional hit men and a group of hackers. Throughout the movie we are led to believe that the world is against this boy. Yet the end wraps up so nicely that you are left saying WTF!? So this ONE guy is the only corruption? Umm what? So they just take him away at the end? No handcuffs even?It really seems as if the writers wrote the movie AS they were shooting it. In this age of twitter exclusives scoops gossip mags leaks and paparazzi were the creators worried that the plot might leak so they wrote it as they went!? Or were they just lazy? Because if you were to watch the movie again NONE of what happened will make sense. I would like to rewatch the movie to make sure. But the acting was so HORRIBLE that it's not even worth it!".

His performance unfortunately doesn't stand out from the veteran actors around him seem to be amiss as to how to turn around their dialogue and lack of character depth into something salvageable.There's no amazing twists or turns no big surprises. The plot goes along just as you'd expect it unless you were expecting imagination. I kept laughing at Lautner's bad delivery at the obvious clichs or stupid plot devices. It gives its twists away quite deliberately leaving nothing for the end but a poor attempt at a tear jerking introduction of Nathan's father. Some things don't even make sense like how Nathan keeps travelling  as he's on the run he obviously is going to try and get out of the city right?  but he can conveniently call his best friend to come meet up with him somewhere to give him things this happens more than once in less than 24 hours. Where did he run to? Down the street? Thank goodness the CIA didn't think to tap his friend's phone!The entire movie seems to reek of an uninspired first draft.".

Okay I'll give the film some credit it is not as bad as the trailer suggested.However the rest is hopelessly bland. The direction is rather plodding and never really that focused. Abduction doesn't necessarily look cheap but the editing lacks finesse and feels stilted and the camera angles often have a dry and frenzied look to it particularly in the action sequences.The music had some decent rock tunes on its own but they don't always suit the tone of the film. The action itself is alright but I couldn't properly enjoy it because the editing felt very awkward and frenzied so any skill and intimacy was lost.Dialoguewise Abduction is awful. It is very laboured clichridden and doesn't flow very well at all complete with popculture references that I agree will date quickly. I liked the concept of the film but I wasn't engaged by the story. The more dramatic scenes are unemotive stodgy and contains Abduction's most stilted moments while the ending is anticlimatic the beginning was cheesy and plot points are poorly incorporated and resolved. I admire films that deal with themes that people can identify with with Abduction using isolation and loss. The film's problem however is that it doesn't do anything with them.Abduction's acting doesn't fare much better with nobody looking natural in their roles. Taylor Lautnerhe as an actor and the Twilight films I am very indifferent to is wooden in a very irritating sense. He doesn't have enough charisma for the action and he seems very disconnected in the dramatic elements of the film. His abs look great but that's it. Lily Collins looks wonderful but does or is given little else beyond that. Alfred Molina is a good actor but not given much to do while Jason Isaacs is wasted and Sigourney Weaver tries her best but hindered by awful dialogue and a character like everyone else in all fairness that I didn't care for at the end of the day.Overall a hopelessly bland derivative poorly acted and stilted film. 210 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Watched this last night and it was mostly what I expected. After a wonky beginning it's generally a popcorn actiondate movie that's not exactly highart. The film is not the worst thing you've ever seen  it's really just an escape with a good production and that's it.Zillions of reviews say Lautner was horrible. Huh? I really think people are just jealous. He was fine and didn't overact  he was sincere fit the role  there is little reason to be upset.These reviews lacerating Lautner were like people destroying Paris Hilton from House of Wax when in actuality she was honestly alright in that. Not a big deal. Granted I don't have strong feelings about either performer.With a strong budget of 30M the film looked confident and solid by John Singleton the film is a fairly easy watch as it goes along  the supporting cast of admired actors Weaver Molina Bello were fine.Singleton isn't too flashy and might just be cashing a check... but one thing he would do is make sure that the actors would have their moments instead of too many quick cutaways.The story is kind of fun in the moment but sure it's silly when you think about it afterwards. But mehh. It was fun. Nothing is horrendous about 'Abduction.' I saw two of the Twilight films and thought they were easy to watch as well  not really a big deal. And Lautner's disposition is somewhat similar in Abduction as he was in Twilight. I think that's alright  he fit the roles fine.If I were to complain about anything is that  of the fighting looked good but  wasn't that great. Secondly the dialog was usually fine but it could get so dull clich I felt sorry for the actors.Thirdly the ending climax with the villain was just straightforward you really see it coming. It's not clever at all  it felt very '80s. Fourthly some of the chasing sequences were good but sometimes they could lack bloodpumping momentum. Despite the complaints the film is still a fun adventure.I'd read so many bad reviews of this film...that maybe my expectations were low. But honestly the film was fine and kinda fun. Just an escape.".

I really think people are just jealous. He was fine and didn't overact  he was sincere fit the role  there is little reason to be upset.These reviews lacerating Lautner were like people destroying Paris Hilton from House of Wax when in actuality she was honestly alright in that.

An action thriller with a heavy dose of martial arts cunning stunts and an unfortunately overused 'sexation' of a young man who admittedly acts rather clumsy with his love interest and has a few unnecessary kissing scenes which were in part also placed rather poorly by the director. Overall however Abduction is a good 'watchable' film which reminded me a bit of Bourne Identity and Wanted with the misfortune of having been aimed at a female teenage audience. And so we grownups have to put up with the unnecessary swipe of the strand of hair in the woods which he does for no reason at all and the odd statement of hey I'm hungry! just as things were heating up in the getaway train.

	schema:reviewBody "Lautner plays Nathan a seventeen year old guy who seems to live two separate lives. He is the popular adrenalineseeking kid who rides to school on car bonnets gets drunk at house parties and has unspoken feelings for the girl next door Karen  overacted here by Lily Collin. He's basically Mr 90210 with less cash.But then there is the other side to Nathan. Behind closed doors he regularly spars with his father in physical battles that become increasingly aggressive and relentless. He also suffers from insomnia and bouts of rage issues that he discusses with his therapist Dr Bennett Weaver in regular counselling sessions. In short he is a mixed up young man.And if life wasn't tough already it's about to deal him one more major bad hand. When assigned to work with Karen on a project about missing kids Nathan's life comes crashing down around him when he sees his face staring back from one of the ads. Suddenly he has to deal with the fact that his parents aren't who they say they are that his whole life is built upon a lie and that everything he thought he knew he didn't.It's no surprise then that he is rather preoccupied by the time the bad guys arrive to get him. Men with guns turn up Nathan does a runner with lusty Karen in tow and what ensues is a cat and mouse chase across the country. It usually sees the youngsters get to one place a phone call gets tapped and then they move on. Then some foreign guy turns up to beat them up they beat him up. They move on. It's quite straightforward really. Predictable to a 't'.That's not to say that it's not entertaining. Remember in the '90s those action movies where the ability to act was a 'would like' and the ability to kick the asses of Eastern European villains was a 'must have'? Well those action movies were EVERYWHERE. A corrupt government or body take on one guy who is pretty good at high kicks and which typically ended in some mass chasecumaction sequence set in a massive public forum such as a football game or a crowded theatre.That is the standard of movie we're talking here. And if we consider Lautner's performance at that level then he didn't do too badly at all. He may still have the acting prowess of Joey Tribbiani from 'Friends' but there's also something rather watchable about him.But my guess is that this wasn't supposed to be seen as a B movie. It feels like a botched attempt to put together a Bourne movie aimed at the teen market. But the Bourne movies appealed to the teen market so why dumb the formulae down? One of the big failings of 'Abduction' is that rationale and reason becomes so diluted that you have to throw all common sense out of the window for this movie to hold together.But that's the least of the worries. By far the biggest problem with this movie was the script and direction which was absolutely diabolical.The camera work seems very lazy. When chatting with his therapist the camera just pans back and forth back and forth between Nathan and Dr Bennett as if the man behind the lens is filming a wedding. Scenes in the gym with the Nathan and his pals have so much happening on screen that you don't know who to look at. But with Lautner skipping up and down off centre in a vest and short combo you can imagine where my eyes were focused.The worst part  or funniest part depending on how I look at it  was that you never felt you were watching a natural performance from anyone involved. It felt SO staged throughout. In fact this is the first time that I have watched a movie at the cinema and literally felt like I could input the director's comments at every appropriate moment.Taylor hold her in your arms. Kiss her head. Now look up to the sky. What makes me feel like this is more a direction fault is that it was not exclusive to Lautner. Even acting legend Sigourney Weaver moves like a spasmodic marionette and whilst she delivers her dialogue there is no real emotion behind them.With lines like I hate balloons followed by a dramatic pause you can understand why she might not be investing everything in to this rather underused character. But if she wasn't happy with the script she'd have not taken the role. The romance between the two youngsters is supposed to be fledgling and to give them their dues there is chemistry there. However when the pair aren't getting amorous the dialogue is laboured and riddled with clichs that leave you either laughing out loud or cringing in to your seat.Karen Two days ago we were high school kids. That seems like a lifetime ago.Nathan That's becausepauseit was.As the pace picks up Lautner actually leaves the cocksure Nathan behind him which comes as a relief and indeed shows some actual character progression. A few big bangs and action sequences are thrown in to the mix and those also help to maintain general interest levels entertaining the audience for fleeting moments in time.However the final denouement is a real let down. No originality. No risk. No surprise. The bog standard bythebook ending is as lazy as the direction and I left the cinema feeling a little bit cheated. If 'Abduction' had presented itself as the kind of movie that it ended up being I'd have known what I was letting myself in for. This is a nofrills BMovie. Don't let the supporting cast make you think otherwise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jane Campion takes us to dark territory again in 'Holy Smoke' but this time with a touch of comedy. I am surprised at the negative response so many have claiming that it is antifeminist blah blah blah or that it is a comedy with no substance. On the contrary I find 'Holy Smoke' to be a provocative piece full of substance.The refreshing novel concept is pretty daring and Campion balances both dark humour and intensity. She tackles various relevant themes such as respect and care within the family the mother is the only one who seems to be concerned about what happened to her daughter in India while the father is totally indifferent sexual manipulation spirituality vs brainwash power control and so on. The viewer is totally absorbed on how the deprogrammer 'saves' Ruth but things take unexpected turns and we start questioning who exactly this PJ Waters is. The relationship between PJ and Ruth gradually becomes reminiscent of that between Lolita and Humbert from Kubrick's 'Lolita'. The dysfunctional family is portrayed in a funny light but the characters's especially the women's despair and struggle is evident such as Mom being concerned about her daughter and Yvonne who is unhappy with her sex life. Campion with the help of the actors creates this whole mysterious atmosphere through the characters. We are given some nice glimpses of the isolated dry Australian landscape.The performances are terrific. Kate Winslet even though occasionally switches back to her own British accent acts phenomenally. She already made a brave choice by choosing such a risky role and the actress just shows how comfortable she is in the skin of her character and mesmerizes the viewer. Harvey Keitel does nothing short of a fine job but he is obviously overshadowed by Winslet. The supporting cast especially Sophie Lee as Ruth's desperate and sleazy sisterinlaw and Julie Hamilton as the concerned and loving mother.'Holy Smoke' is a wellmade and brave film. Clearly it is not for everyone. There are very few movies that are both funny and thoughtprovoking. 'Holy Smoke' is one such captivating film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kate Winslet plays Ruth Barron a young Australian woman who goes to India and becomes smitten with the touch of a charismatic guru so much so that she changes her name and forsakes her family to stay in India and attend to and worship the guru. Her parents become alarmed. Her mother goes to India to trick her into coming back to Australia so that she can be deprogrammed by a professional from the United States that they have hired P.J. Waters as played by Harvey Keitel.What director Jane Campion does with this once familiar theme is most interesting. She puts the deprogrammer to the test so to speak and initiates a struggle of will between the deprogrammer and his young charge. The key scene arrives as Ruth comes naked into P.J.'s arms in order to test his professionalism and her sexual power. I don't know about you but I think a naked and passionate Kate Winslet would test any man's motivation and make him think twice about what he really wants to do.The psychological idea behind the story is this question What is the nature of the guru's hold on his flock? Is it spiritual or is it profane? Do the young women who follow him desire him as an alpha male or is it spiritual deliverance they seek? Naturally Ruth believes the latter and the deprogrammer the former. But what is the deprogammer's motivation? Is this just a job for him or does he feel he is helping to free his clients from some kind of mental slavery? Or is he just another sort of phony guru himself? Keitel in black hair and black moustache and devil's mini goatee dressed in black with a menacing look and a lot of physical energy despite being 60yearsold when this film was released contrasts sharply with Winslet's youthful beauty and beguiling voluptuousness. Strength of character is something Kate Winslet brings to any role even including her outstanding performance as Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet 1996 a role that is usually played wiltingly. Here one senses that her strong will and determination are going to be quite a match for the deprogrammer who gives himself three days alone with her to break her attachment to the guru.Two questions One if he is successful will that just mean that she has transferred her allegiance from the Indian guru to him? Will it mean that his psychological strength is greater than that of the guru in faroff India? Two in what respect is such a forced confinement with someone who is in physical control going to lead to a variant of the Stockholm syndrome experienced by some women held hostage e.g. flight attendants on hijacked planes and the famous case of Patty Hearst? Will the captive become enamored of her captor? Campion handles this most interesting theme by focusing on the sexual and carnal nature of the relationships. The test of will between P.J. and Ruth becomes a question of Can she seduce him and thereby strip him of his professionalism? The movie is candid about sex and sexuality in a way that emphasizes the power dynamics of sexual relationships. There is some full frontal nudity and the sex scenes are steamy beyond what one usually sees in an Rrated film. If seeing Kate Winslet naked might offend you I recommend you close your eyes. Harvey Keitel did an outstanding job in a very demanding role and was entirely convincing despite being a little too old for the part but as usual Kate Winslet completely took over the film with her commanding countenance her superior acting skills her great concentration and her mesmerizing charisma. If there is a better more captivating young actress working today I don't know who she is.Her role here might be compared with her performance in Hideous Kinky 1998 in which she goes to Morocco to find enlightenment among the Sufis. That is a more charming film and she is outstanding but this one gives greater range to her skills.Notable and watchable! as a counterpoint to Winslet's Ruth is sexy and sleazy Sophie Lee as Yvonne who is so taken with P.J. that she fairly begs him to make love to her. Also impressive is Julie Hamilton as the woebegone and stumbling mother.Of course I would say see this for Kate Winslet and if you are a fan you sure don't want to miss Holy Smoke since it includes one of her best performances however what really impressed me is the original and daring conception and direction by Jane Campion who is best known for The Piano 1993 a film that received an Oscar nomination for the best direction and starred Holly Hunter Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill.So see this for Jane Campion who is not afraid to show human nature in the raw.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

The trailer banks on the promise with which the movie starts but this promise is completely squandered.  If it hadn't left me feeling that so much was wasted including my expectations and time then I would score it a little higher but it is a letdown.I got geared up for a satisfying battle of the wills with strong sexual tension and witty comedy  uh no.  All the hopes you might have for this entwined with the interesting topics of spiritual belief familylove expectations and narrowness and cult deprogramming will be lost quickly. The characters RUSH into sex and any real interesting issues are suddenly discarded.  It just becomes a drawn out mess with 2 lost people clawing at each other and calling each other names.  An older man becoming obsessed with a nubile young woman for some reason she spends an awful lot of time hanging around in a bra who taunts him with it.  Where is his strength? We are supposed to believe that he has worked with 189 other vulnerable young people and his experience leads him to this pathetic breakdown of trust and decency so quickly?  And what about the devotion she had for her belief? Gone.  This could all be the source of a good dark film if it was handled and explored well but it isn't here and this film doesn't make a good transition to it as a subject.  It just left me feeling a bit lost and abused having watched people being so rotten to one another to no good end the wrapup we're OK now and better for the experience ending is just bogus.  I got the sense that the filmmakers ran out of steam on this  that there were supposed to be many levels at work but they just couldn't keep it up.  I saw this with two friends and we talked about it for a while afterwards mainly because we were trying to salvage the unfulfilled promise of interesting topics opened in the beginning of the film.  It left us feeling stranded needing to talk about it in order to follow through on what the film didn't deliver.  We also needed to just get the bad taste of the film out of our mouths.I see from other viewer comments that people argue that it raises many issues  it does but that doesn't make it a good film.  It opens too many doors and then let's all the good stuff fly away.  It's a shame because the first part really seems to be the opening to a view of cult deprogramming with Ruth's zany family as a background that bunch of characters is wasted which is too bad and then it suddenly becomes about sex desperation and nastiness nothing clever.  And the sex isn't even sexy  it's pathetic desperate sex.  Ick.  Perhaps this movie is worth seeing for the things that are brought up  but be aware that it doesn't come near to completing the journey with any of them and that it is not as clever and funny as the trailer and the beginning would lead you to believe.  Be prepared for the characters to fall apart and to sit through a long period of people being just being mean and debased until you just don't care about them at all anymore.  All too bad  some very talented people were involved in this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bizarre. Fascinating. Flawed. Out of control. Definitely not ordinary. I can use all those expressions to show what I feel about Holy Smoke but I think they are not enough to express all my mixed feelings about it. This is not an easy film to watch and more difficult than that to review but I can say that its qualities overcome the majority of its flaws.Holy Smoke is a story about two totally different people. Ruth is a young Australian woman who travels to India and there starts to take part in a cult getting fascinated with it. Her family starts to get worried about that and contracts PJ Waters the other face of the coin to make Ruth forgets her new beliefs and return to a normal life. They will spent some very unusual days in a hut on the desert where we don't know who is in charge of the situation. Jane Campion writes and directs this weird and tense story with a wonderful passion. She tries to escape from all the clichs and succeeds in. There are some other stories of Ruth's weird family her gay brother her nymphomaniac sisterinlaw her ingenuous mother. This is the humorous part of the film where you'll see even a sheep serving as a table at Ruth's house. But strangely Holy Smoke didn't feel as a dramatic comedy. It's one of those pictures that you can't define the genre with sure.All the qualities and flaws of Holy Smoke come from the directing and the writing. There are some slow moments exaggerated situations some out of places scenes which could have been easily deleted. These are the main reasons why I didn't enjoy very much Jane Campion's earlier works the overrated The Piano and the tasteless The Portrait of a Lady. But here the flaws sometimes can be forgotten because Campion explains the story better than in her other works and succeeds in captivating the audience with an interesting story discussing subjects as sex and religion with the right tone. The one who really shines here is Kate Winslet. Harvey Keitel is great as always but Ms. Winslet gives us an Oscar caliber performance. She doesn't have problem in appearing naked sing dress Keitel with a red dress and say what she thinks. I'm sure that her performance won't disappear in smoke at least for me.Holy Smoke was very criticized and snubbed but it deserves a second chance. I agree that it is flawed and obviously not for everyone. But watch it with patience pay attention at the subliminal messages have some fun and think a little. It is worth the price of the ticket.".

On the surface it's a hugely funny portrait of a hypocritical conservative family's farcical efforts to  cling to normality when Winslet's character begins to branch out.Look below the surface of the superb performances especially Winslet and Keitel and there are some wry observations about religious bigotry and parental disrespect. Winslet and Keitel bring their usual innate honesty and chutzpah to their roles creating an intense sexual chemistry that is always under their total control.While Winslet's is by far the most accurate Australian accent I've heard from a British actor watch out for Sophie Lee a very funny genuine article who I hope we'll see again soon. My only criticism is that Pam Grier was not allowed more involvement. I would have liked to have see her role developed far more.Jane Campion's direction is refreshing as always.

It also has some nice cinematography and some interesting visual tricks but apart from that the film is kind of a mixed bag.  The story concerns Winslet's family trying to break her from the hold of a religious sect in India.  Harvey Keitel is called in by the family to break Winslet and return her to her family.  What follows is a three day odyssey that contains an odd transformation from both characters.   I'm not sure how I felt after seeing the film to tell the truth I'm still not sure what the film was saying.";

The Kino Cas required a minimum of 8 people to buy tickets or they would not show the movie.  The crowd numbered about 12. I enjoyed Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet's roles very much.  Just when you think that you've met the most dysfunctional family in your personal experiences here is one to top them all.  Kate Winslet's family is in need of a deprogrammer to rescue their daughter from the clutches of Eastern Transcendentalism and they call on Harvey Keitel's character to get the job done. Some may find the movie silly but I thought it touched some real difficult issues faced by many.  I was lost in thought during much of the film so I revisited the Cino Cas the following afternoon to see it again. It rated a 9 from my perspective. R Morris".

The film looked promising a great director two great lead actors who I respect immensely and an interesting subject matter. The film quickly went downhill. The entire film is stylistically and structurally disjointed. The director didn't seem to know if she wanted to make the film realistic or not so she just sort of goes into nonsequitor fantasy sequences at random points in the film most of which just end up looking silly in an otherwise realistic looking film. The whole thing with Ruth's running off and joining a cult would have created more sympathy for her if there was ever any actual explanation as to what the cult was doing or proof that they were actually dangerous. This was never proved and in fact the entire religion actually comes off looking legitimate especially with the fantasy shot in which the guru touches Ruth's forehead and a third eye opens up in her forehead which suggests that this guru actually does have spiritual powers which contradicts the rest of the film.Not that this matters however as halfway through the film the writers decided that the story was no longer about the cult and just made it about this weird sexual relationship between a psychiatrist and his client. Seeing Kate Winslet naked seems to be everyone's favorite part of this film but as wonderful as that is it comes out of nowhere and is made ludicrous and disgusting by the fact that she is peeing on herself. And while seeing Harvey Keitel running around in the deserts of Australia wearing a little red dress is certainly entertaining I really think that at that point the audience is laughing AT the film not with it.Don't believe these people who try to tell you that this movie is over some people's heads. These are the same people who think that if anything is weird or doesn't make sense then it has some deeper meaning that they're missing so they better pretend to see it so that they look smart. You know the Emperor's New Clothes kind of people. This movie is crap. The characters are unbelievable the dialogue is pretentious and annoyingly pseudo intellectual the imagery lacks any form of subtlety and aside from a few laughs and some good performances from Keitel and Winslet there are no redeeming qualities to this film.1 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I knew right away that many popular critics would dislike HOLY SMOKE. They're typically representative of common thought  though perhaps more arrogant and more resistant to personal analysis. Like Nietzsche Jane Campion challenges each of us to selfassess and allows no one to escape scrutiny. By the same token Campion offers understanding for everyone. HOLY SMOKE doesn't take the superficial road  the good vs evil approach to issues like the characters in the film do although I believe it would have enjoyed better critical reception had it done exactly that.The beauty and artistic brilliance by which Campion has dramatized the universal conditions of selfrighteousness hypocrisy and the various justifications to preserve one's comfort of the familiar is also what I believe caused critics and many viewers discomfort. To me that very reaction pushes the ironic validity of HOLY SMOKE even further.I had seen Campion's THE PIANO also featuring Harvey Keitel as the male lead a hauntingly beautiful and tragic story of passion that finds its way through the unique gift of a woman and the interest of a man in what she has to give. I was inspired to write a long letter of appreciation and thanks to Jane Campion for her awareness and honesty her bluntness her artistry and her guts. Depending on one's point of view she either empowers or threatens. Her loving treatment of women who traditionally have been taken for granted  their individual desires interests and abilities largely disregarded  is evident in her art. But she doesn't stop there. She also shows true compassion and understanding for those whose rigidity and lack of selfawareness cause tragedy.I saw HOLY SMOKE when it first came to theaters and I was mesmerized. Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet are brave artists who challenge themselves beyond where many would dare to go. From the double meaning of the title HOLY SMOKE I focused more on the use of religion as a diversionary tool that often clouds reality with smokescreens of piety and righteousness to the true perversions of our lies mostly the lies we tell ourselves for comfort HOLY SMOKE stays right on track. The creativity and individuality we sacrifice including our own and those of our loved ones in order to maintain appearances are real. The contortions we go through to become someone else or to escape our own realities with socially acceptable vices cigarettes alcohol bleaching tanning etc. and the desperate acts we perform in order to fit in or to be accepted are exposed within each scene. But we are so used to accepting these things in our everyday lives it's easy to miss some of the references in the film. Either that or we are too uncomfortable to admit it for ourselves.So while some viewerscritics stop wanting to think when Ruth Barron Winslet urinates on herself an event that turns the tables on her captor by literally forcing the question of who is in control  I wonder why people wouldn't be more concerned about the intolerable situation Ruth is faced with. I imagine this scene allows for the dismissal of the film as obscene or overthetop. But with that I was able to sit up and take note of this woman's inner strength.An aside I can't help but recall stories of women who prevent rape by defecating during the attempted crime. But how many of us would consider that too rude or impolite if faced with the same situation? Women are conditioned to accept these things or to blame themselves but Ruth defies her captor's rules.While some may be put off or confused by witnessing such a macho man as PJ Waters allowing young Ruth to dress him in lipstick and a dress I find the literate beauty of these scenes as evidence of Campion's insight into the human condition. Not only does the film slowly unveil the hidden realities of PJs state of being and affirm Ruth's strength even when apparently under the control of others the scenes offer a cathartic effect  especially perhaps for women but also for anyone who struggles to break the mold or challenge the status quo.The notion that macho behavior is really a coverup for fear of not being manly enough is creatively expressed in HOLY SMOKE. Campion through Winslet's powerful portrayal of Ruth and Keitel's gripping characterization of PJ exposes lies deceits and the true perversions that come from repression of any challenges to the status quo at all costs.If I were to isolate related theses for HOLY SMOKE they would be Who defines what is acceptable or not acceptable and why? What is right and what is wrong? What is womanly and what is manly? If all we have to go on is our own life experience and we know we struggle with doubts every day in our own lives can we really decide for others what is best? Yet aren't we also so quick to judge and feel selfrighteous about the lives of others  especially those that most challenge our own experiences and understanding? Too often it is easier to criticize and want to control the lives of others than to look inward critically assessing our own weaknesses and deepest personal fears.I am uncertain about how I feel about the very ending. I like to believe that such a man or any human can grow from such experiences but I think it would be even more likely PJ would have been so defensive of his masculinity that he would have killed himself first. That sense is the only detail that keeps me from giving HOLY SMOKE a perfect score though I'm sure Campion considered all this too. I would love to have the discussion with her about her decision! Still a small issue within a wonderful and brave film.".

And it has grown on me.Having investigated eastern philosophy and western mysticism for years I appreciate Jane Campion's competency in dealing with themes of a metaphysical nature.  I was stunned by her use of metaphor in The Piano a constant returning to the place of origination the synergy of yin and yang the veil of illusion and the mystery of expression the word.Holy Smoke is more direct in its approach but effective in exploring themes of power and love as both intimate and universal life forces.  As usual Campion approaches her subjects with an unflinching but sympathetic eye.I am always nearly a fan of Campion's production values  I love the saturated dark colors the carefully contrived shots the whimsical and sparing use of special effects and humor and typically incredible casting.While appealing on an aesthetic level what appeals to me most about Holy Smoke is that it deals with some of my favorite themes  the illusory nature of reality the vulnerability and power of the human mind and heart and the sometimes shocking sometimes humorous ways that we learn from the wisdom of the universe.In Holy Smoke when I saw PJ Waters get off the plane to the sound of Neil Diamond singing I am I said... I am I cried I took notice and became expectant of a punch line somewhere down the road.This film could be called flawed and is definitely not for everyone but I come away from it feeling empowered humbled and amusedand appreciative of the sensitive creative adventurous spirits who made it.PJ Waters is retained as an expert to deprogram Ruth but the Universe has other plans in mind...

As usual Campion approaches her subjects with an unflinching but sympathetic eye.I am always nearly a fan of Campion's production values  I love the saturated dark colors the carefully contrived shots the whimsical and sparing use of special effects and humor and typically incredible casting.While appealing on an aesthetic level what appeals to me most about Holy Smoke is that it deals with some of my favorite themes  the illusory nature of reality the vulnerability and power of the human mind and heart and the sometimes shocking sometimes humorous ways that we learn from the wisdom of the universe.In Holy Smoke when I saw PJ Waters get off the plane to the sound of Neil Diamond singing I am I said... I am I cried I took notice and became expectant of a punch line somewhere down the road.This film could be called flawed and is definitely not for everyone but I come away from it feeling empowered humbled and amusedand appreciative of the sensitive creative adventurous spirits who made it.PJ Waters is retained as an expert to deprogram Ruth but the Universe has other plans in mind... I love it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to like Holy Smoke more than I did. There is a clear study in the film a likable element about it that establishes one thing develops that and then has the audacity to spin things around onto its head for our own amusement. The film isn't bad as much as it is a little misguided and inconsistent in tone thus a tad frustrating by the end. It would have been nice for the film not to have spilt out into a realm of comedy and not get so overrawed by itself when it relies purely on the image of Harvey Keitel in a dress to get across feeling instead of developing what new level it's attempting to lever up onto.The film is principally a study of the power certain people or 'texts' can have over others or those of a weaker more naive disposition. The one thing the film does tell us is that it can be anybody who falls for the charms or tricks of anybody else even macho PJ Waters Keitel who is supposed to be this egodriven ever immune hardasnails 'never takes no for an answer' and 'nobody puts one over him' caricature. The film's other victim of texts or ideation's that have 'influenced' them to act in artificial ways is a certain Ruth Barron Winslet a simplistic and relatively likable Australian girl with a steady life and a family that is very fond of her.PJ exists in the film because of Ruth's inability to deal with the influence a certain Indian guru's image and ideas have on her. Ruth exists in the film to bring PJ into her life and furthermore influence him in both a spiritual and sexual sense. For the best part the film looks at what affect certain texts and teachings can have on the young and outgoing plus whatever affect those attempting an antithesis on these beliefs can further suffer at the hands of their own patient. Unfortunately the film cannot hold it all together and incorporates elements including but not limited to slapstick comedy loose sexy women as a drive for potential humour wellknown female global stars in the nude for sake of hearsay as well as well known male global stars dressed as women for a similar sake.The film begins with Ruth in India. Whilst there she falls under the influence of a popular Indian guru at the tapping of a forehead and a staring into the eyes. Job done it would seem. Following this she becomes trapped in the mindsets and ways of life so much so that her mother has to fly out in order to 'rescue' her. Ruth doesn't come home initially but after some banter and some comedy revolving around what a supposed dump really India is she returns to Oz. Once home there is a particularly eerie scene in which members of her own family have gathered as one to subdue her thus refraining her from escaping back to the 'evil' world of India with all their 'evil' influential practises that they do on young Western women. Could have been worse they could've conned her into giving away her credit card details as well.Hark when there's something strange  and it don't look good who are you going to call? Why PJ Waters of course  a man listed somewhere in the phonebook under 'exorcist' I imagine. PJ is charged with ridding Ruth of these Hindu beliefs. I didn't think it would be so easy otherwise we wouldn't have had a film would we? I was expecting it to bed down and become a struggle of sexual politics as this gum chewing snake skin boot wearing shades wearing person who's given all the build up he needs went up against this young woman out to discover herself in the big wide world. I was expecting a study of identities a look at the role of one's self in contemporary Australia and how the Indian 'beliefs' perhaps elevated her to a new spiritual sense thus helping her see things the way she wanted.What we get is a bizarre passage of events. The 'exorcism' plays out and mutates into a sort of 'patient begins to become object of doctor's desire' relationship between the two that further aids in bringing out PJ Waters' feminine side so to speak. I found it quite amusing at how female director Jane Campion turns the tables on us how she presents the female of the piece as weak minded and foolish while the male is the battleweary intellectual individual out to 'correct' the female before mixing it all up and turning it on its head. Alas on the whole Campion is more interested in shooting Winslet in an array of skimpy outfits before Kietel gets a chance of his own she is more interested in a young boy dressed as Batman jumping off a car roof and smacking into the ground as a guardian fails to catch him she is more interested in the flirtatious attitudes of Yvone Lee to act as humour and when lines like I'm sorry Ruth I should never have slept with you. from PJ evoke guffaws more than anything else you sort of realise things are not all well.There were some things I liked about Holy Smoke but they aren't focused on enough for me to recommend it. Once Ruth becomes PJ's object of desire following a bizarre scene in a night club the film falls apart somewhat and just becomes a slightly unconventional love story with very uncinematic and unlikable in equal measure words like 'quirky' and 'kooky' being able to be attributed to it. The premise has been solved we're heading off in new directions and the whole thing just fizzles out in a miserystrewn manner. Not a disaster but not focused and even enough to be fond of.".

Ruth and PJ play out their psychodrama in the outback away from the bourgeois normality that is desperate to reassert itself.  Because Judy's great crime is not the joining of a loony cult but the fact that she has run away she has made her own choice she has refused the hypocritical grind of conventional domesticity and marriage in favour of a more liberating connection.It is not really the point that this is quaintly oldfashioned material or that Judy's cult IS loony that its appropriation of Hindu authority is gleeful kitsch that the 'guru''s intentions may be less than spiritual that Campion films the Indian sequence as with much else in this deceptively 'serious' film with surreal flippancy.  The fact is that Judy's transgression is contrasted with the 'normality' of her home life a life based on mendacity adultery sickness idiocy and worst of all a repressive conformity verging on the fascist or cultlike made even more frightening in that the grotesques surrounding her seem so loveably stupid.Campion's method in the film seems to be to wear everyone down to strip everyone of illusion faith pride pretension.  This is how the struggle between Judy and PJ plays.  In one way it's a LAST TANGO IN PARISexercise in sexual nihilism.  Out in the wilderness in the 'cave' as PJ calls it stripped of inessentials both characters engage in a gladiatorial conflict removing all conventions and defences until they are bloody and beaten they are not longer the selves they have created for themselves.No one wins we are brought to the beginning we are allowed start again. Judy goes back to India where she began the movie PJ abandons his lecherous ways to become a partner father and after the families we've seen this is hardly a victory and novelist. The 'normal' family are in a sense rent too the father finally leaves with his mistress the mother goes to renew herself in India with Judy the sister has already cheated on her doltish husband.Can it really be this simple?  The mindsex games seem to take place according to very violent SM principles and the sexual undercurrent bursts into roleplay gender fluidity and humiliation.  But is there a real counter to the violence inflicted on Judy?  The horrifying scene where she is corralled by her male 'family' is continued by PJ's games and the attempted rape in the nightclub.  PJ as a bullying agent of male domination deserves to be cut down to size but what did Judy do to deserve her punishment?  The whiff of female masochism running throughout is possibly suspect  we expect it of Harvey at this stage but can women only experience freedom through degradation or is this just a 'comment' on how liberated women really are today?The difficulties and ultimate pleasure of the film lies you see in its wavering tone.  Although the film copies Wong KarWai's fluid subjective style on occasion in its use of colour and editing there is an oppressive theatricality as you would expect with a conflict between two protagonists in a fixed set.  And while the film concerns some very fundamental traumas there is a vein of absurd humour that Campion seemed to have lost in her previous prestige costume dramas but that is gloriously in evidence here slapstick unexpected silly crude surreal wonderful.This fluidity of forms of tones mirrors the identity and gender issues the film raises.  Campion's sense of landscape authentic and in awe yet laced with both heightened camp and Hollywood melodrama is unique further charged in that this mythic Australian space is being contested by AngloAmericans as well as Woman and Man.  In spite of some flaws  pacing in the second half especially  this is much better than the reviews have been claiming.".

	schema:headline " weirdness ensues in the logical conclusion to hideous Kinky";
	schema:reviewBody "Years from now Kate Winslet's 2 travelogue films 1998's Hideous Kinky and 1999's Holy Smoke will be seen as one continuous movie. Sure Kinky is solely set in the 70s in Morocco and Smoke goes back and forth between a teeming India and a desolate Australian outback but overall the parallels are too uncanny to be ignored. Both feature the beautiful Winslet in beautiful foreign locales seeking enlightenment and mostly getting dicked around by those who claim to be out to help her. Of the two Hideous is holier and Smoke is kinkier. Holy Smoke is also the far better film focusing on the intensely emotional often depraved deprogramming of a young woman who joins an indian cult Winsletand the ultimate unraveling of her exit counselor Keitel. Though the film does a decent job of documenting a deprogramming session in typical Jane Campion fashion she wrote and directed the film also invests a good deal of energy delving into the sexual politics and is ultimately about a lot more than even that. Thanks to Campion's painterly eye the visuals are occasionally stunning and the female acting is top notch. Keitel who did such an arresting job in Campion's 1993 film The Piano is volcanic here as well. And like The Piano his penis also makes a cameo.

	onyx:emotionText "Years from now Kate Winslet's 2 travelogue films 1998's Hideous Kinky and 1999's Holy Smoke will be seen as one continuous movie. Sure Kinky is solely set in the 70s in Morocco and Smoke goes back and forth between a teeming India and a desolate Australian outback but overall the parallels are too uncanny to be ignored. Both feature the beautiful Winslet in beautiful foreign locales seeking enlightenment and mostly getting dicked around by those who claim to be out to help her. Of the two Hideous is holier and Smoke is kinkier. Holy Smoke is also the far better film focusing on the intensely emotional often depraved deprogramming of a young woman who joins an indian cult Winsletand the ultimate unraveling of her exit counselor Keitel. Though the film does a decent job of documenting a deprogramming session in typical Jane Campion fashion she wrote and directed the film also invests a good deal of energy delving into the sexual politics and is ultimately about a lot more than even that. Thanks to Campion's painterly eye the visuals are occasionally stunning and the female acting is top notch. Keitel who did such an arresting job in Campion's 1993 film The Piano is volcanic here as well. And like The Piano his penis also makes a cameo.

In this particular film she has reached me. For film to be good it has to place me where I would not go and change me. This time I was swept up in this seemingly simple drama the wilds unknown motives undirected ideals misplaced trust. The images were unique and the acting superb. I saw Kate in Hamlet and wondered if this was the same woman I had seen in Titanic. Her Ophelia a challenge for anyone was delicately layered. I'll be interested in watching her grow. Somewhat gratifying to see someone without a Barbie figure being sexy.What worries me is how Campion had to make the whole rest of the world comically surreal in order to focus on her duo. She controls this part and then lets the central drama run wild. I think she really was beyond her limits with this central drama but that's what makes it genuine. Portrait of a Lady suffered from too much control   here she shifts that control to the ludicrous aussie family and lets the central drama roam.Kate understands that she is not acting a character but a belief system or rather a belief in belief systems. We saw that in Ophelia and I'm sure that's why she was picked here. Keitel's defeat is an exposure of Christianity. But poor Harvey is a plain old excellent actor who just becomes his character. I'm sure he had no understanding that he was to symbolize something and so while he connects with Winslow he doesn't with Campion's vision.Some symbols were unwelcome by me because they were so deliberately placed the pee the reindeercar the koala bear...So a little out of control tarted up with postfeminist pretentiousness and one of the performances excellent but a near miss.

The family brings in a deprogrammer Harvey Keitel who is a specialist at breaking young woman who have fallen under the spell of cult members. I can't say this is a totally winning film but it did keep me entertained from start to finish and just when you thought it couldn't get any stranger it certainly does in its second half. This film really isn't about cults but instead the struggles between men and women. The first film has Keitel pulling his magic on Winslet who in the second half gets her revenge by putting her hooks into him. Whereas the first film has some sort of religious undertone the second half is a weird sexual journey which includes Winslet in a full nudity scene one with her kissing a woman and we even get to see Keitel in a dress walking around a desert in one boot. I'm really not sure what the film is trying to say or if its even trying to say anything at all. Campion is best known for The Piano which also had Keitel but that film seems normal compared to this one. I've heard people call this a feminist movie which might be correct but again the ending would lead you to believe this isn't correct. The movie is all over the map in terms of what it's trying to say and do so I guess it's going to be up to the viewer to try and make up their own mind. I'm sure many people will find the film slow and boring but the pacing is what dragged me into the movie and got me caught up with the characters. I think fans of Keitel and Winslet will be the ones walking away entertained because both give great performances and really work well together. Both are so deep into their roles that you can't help but be fascinated by each step they make and in the end they're what saves an otherwise pointless film.".

Makes you feel bad that poor old Huey himself didn't make it to Woodstock.  Quote by Hopper's character Huey Walker Did you know that all condoms have a serial number on 'em?  No?

A Fed Kiefer Sutherland is bringing in an UNDERGROUND '60's political fugitive Dennis Hopper. The sidetracks are entertaining and this may seem silly BUT the story is somewhat plausible...maybe not in the real world but certainly in the REEL world.

Dennis Hopper plays his role with near perfection and it almost seems like he fit the part a little too well. The supporting cast does a great job as well and overall I'd say the acting while not Oscar worthy is well done. This movie is no grand epic but does carry a lot of depth and meaning for those perceptive enough to pick up on the subtle parts.

With Bucker sutherland the tough FBI Agent and Walker hopper the rebel hippy they are brought together and change each others lives. In the end they end up working together helping each other out. Bucker found out who he really was with the help of Walker and Bucker finally goes to his parents after running away when he was younger The film brought tears to my eyes it really did and for me thats hard to do. Kiefer plays such a great role i'm already a huge fan of his and he is very cute in this film. With the lovable humour and tearful moments it will get you hooked.

	schema:reviewBody "During the 80's and 90's home video was an unexpected but explosive new entertainment medium. Can anyone forget regularly scanning your nearby video store for something new to rent? It gave writers and producers much more room to produce films that never would have made it to the screen. Production money may have been spare but sometimes Blevel movies are the best of all and Flashback applies. It wasn't a trip back in time as the title suggests it was a look at the Establishment winning the culture war. Yuppies had replaced the Hippies. Perhaps the most poignant line was when the wizened old hippie Huey Dennis Hopper reminds the yuppie FBI agent John Buckner Keifer Sutherland that the 1980's the Reagan Administration created two classes of people  the Rich and the Poor. More true today than it was then. As the story plays out in a comical and entertaining way  Buckner escorting Huey to jail but unexpectedly fleeing from a murderous smalltown sheriff  we learn that maybe Huey wasn't as much a hippie as we thought. And we also learn that Buckner was the son of a hippie commune family and his real name is 'Free'. By the end of the movie Huey finally gets his book published and loves the fame yet keeps his brazen attitude and Buckner realizes the hippie liberalists were pretty good after all. He quits the FBI and sets out to rediscover his roots. One downside is watching FreeBuckner ride off into the sunset on a riceburner bike instead of a Harley but acceptable considering the movie was to bridge the 60's to the 90's. The other is seeing Huey propound his belief that the 90's would be so radical socially that it would put the 60's to shame. Sad to learn that it would never happen. Altogether Flashback is a firstrate film worth owning not just seeing. Greats like Dennis Hopper and Keifer Sutherland are at their best it's a clever story very entertaining and thought provoking enough to make you wonder what the heck happened to a once bullish youth not afraid to get nosetonose with a Fasciststyle government.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoy the 1990 movie Flashback though mostly for it's first 4550 minutes. That section has some extra pep if that's the word in a kind of doublecrossing wacky comedy involving a former 60s radical rebel Huey Walker Dennis Hopper at first in a sweet hippie getup who got arrested escaped went on the lam and then got arrested again for an 'incident' involving Spiro Agnew's train in 1969. When things don't go so right at all when Buckner Kiefer Sutherland a sort of prototype of his character on 24 I'd wager gets the screws turned on him when tricked into thinking he's been slipped LSD. Walker looks like he's making his escape after shaving his beard and even with the chance of great publicity for his new book. But a wrong turn comes via a couple of average knuckleheads Michael McKean one of them not with nearly enough to be his usual comedic best and then another cross turned by the local sheriff who doesn't want anything reported on the treatment towards Buckner in prison. So in short all of this is actually pretty entertaining with some funny bits scattered all around and a great flow for dialog that goes around during the train ride between Buckner and Walker I also enjoyed even as slight amusing stuff the scenes in the woods at night.But then the screenwriter takes a sharp turn into contrivance and the film basically never fully recovers Buckner leads Walker to his first home as a kid a commune where he was originally named 'Free' and gradually gets a change of heart from the middleaged lady who resides there now. All of this might spark up a twinkle in some old hippie fogey's eye but it just seemed like a sharp shift in the tone that wasn't needed. Maybe the writer or director couldn't think of a better way to keep the story moving once it gets to its generic conclusions involving a chase and some minor violence on the train it's only passable and at worst pretty trite so they had to insert a fluffy communehippie piece with Hopper the only one making it only minutely worthwhile. A shame really as I liked watching chunks of the film early on a totally guilty pleasure vein as an admirer of the trashy exploitation pictures of the flower power era and to an extent trashy 80s FBIcop thrillers too. Hopper and Sutherland don't make a bad odd couple either all things considered. But it's not a puzzle either as to why I'd have not too much trouble finding it in the cheapvideo bin at the store. Maybe better if you're hardcore fans of either actor as a coda for Easy Rider however it's really lacking that 'something' of that film.".

Nope I didn't find his name referenced neither in Irish or Texan literature. What a shame!Further extrapolate my ideas on Mayne Reid.

France Morocco and Germany joined forces to produce this movie which story takes place a long time ago somewhere in NorthAfrica. This results in the strange fact that during that time period all the inhabitants seemed to speak French. Oh well we'll forgive the producers because this clearly is a decision made from a commercial point of view.Zana is an 11yearold girl whose mother just died. According to Zana her stepfather Omar was responsible for this incident. Then her real father Mustapha shows up. Until recently he didn't know of Zana's existence. She is entrusted to Mustapha and must accompany him during a 20daylong voyage to Marrakech. There Mustapha will join the most prestigious horserace of NorthAfrica. Omar being very displeased with all this starts to pursue them. During their difficult journey through the inhospitable Atlasmountains father and daughter slowly grow towards each other.This movie promises us adventure and excitement. Sadly it results in a movie lacking those elements. The only not very spectacular actionscenes are a swordfight between the gangs of Omar and Mustapha a nightly encounter with horsethieves and the horserace in the end which is not so prestigious after all. The three swordfights you can find in the movie are always over before they really started. And the bluegreenscreen effects during the scene were our protagonists cross a ridge in the mountains are painfully obvious. I admit this is not an American bigbudget production so you can forgive the effects being a bit transparent but you can't forgive the Hollywoodian ending of this movie. Further more this movie tries to make a statement about the place of women in society as portrayed during that timeperiod the movie takes place in only to deny that statement at the end.The dialogues are rather scarce and not really fluent. And it doesn't help that most of the actors give a fairly wooden performance. Though the three main characters do shed some tears at one point or another all the actors seem kind of emotionless except for the cheering ladies in the end.So are there any reasons to see this movie? Most certainly. The settings and photography of the landscapes are astonishingly beautiful. From the desolate rocky desert over the snowy mountainranges to the idyllic green oasis with a gentle rippling little stream running through it. Aziza Nadir though very young gives a decent performance as Zana and keeps strong between all the male testosterone. The way Mustapha and Zana start to appreciate each other more and more is beautiful to behold. And of course there's so many horses not to mention the extol of them that any horselover would want to see this movie.ZANA CAVALIRE DE L'ATLAS is probably not Oscarmaterial though it tries hard but it is worth a watch. If only for the magnificent landscapes supported by an adequate soundtrack.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joan Crawford is the lone notable hilight in this highly ridiculous yet entertaining popcorn fluff where a psychopath infiltrates and wreaks havoc upon a traveling circus troupe in Europe.Joan Crawford portrays the owner and ringmaster of the Circus The Great Rivers Circus  she is a gutsy feisty noholdsbarred woman who is hellbent on running her circus while a murderer terrorizes her employees by offing their victims in bizarre fashions. For example one tight rope walker is hanged by his own tightrope after it frays and snaps during a live performance  another man has a pick driven through his head and a woman is literally 'sawed' in half in a hilarious scene that involves a buzz saw and two missing screws !!.Meanwhile Crawford tries to capitalize on the murders by cashing in on the general public and their morbid fascination with death by making sure that the 'show must go on'. Box office receipts have never been better after the murders begin and the audience must wonder is Crawford behind it all? Is this just some sick overthetop publicity stunt?Further characters introduced into the story line include a hotshot tightrope walker Ty Hardin who also plays her love interest and future business partner a flirtatious blonde circus performer who tries to stir up trouble among her colleagues by implying that Crawford is the murderer and an incredibly ludicrous situation that allows the film to introduce Angela Crawford's mischiefmaking daughter who has just been expelled from an exclusive ladies college for her disruptive behavior. Any of these key players including all the circus folk could turn out to be the murderer but which one is it?Crawford is perfectly cast in BERSERK in a highly camp role that could only have worked with no one else but her in it. Sporting a ridiculous blonde hairdo while wearing seethrough night apparel and exposing her long legs while donning a ring master's outfit she manages to nail down hilarious one liners such as That Matilda the Mouth! and Just remember I was the one who gave you all a home! while at the same time keeping a straight face. Her delivery of such is highly commendable.Besides Crawford's performance many other highly camp scenes also take place in the movie  including a cat fight scene that breaks out between two women after one heckles at the other Don't fall down  you might hurt your brain! Crawford being stalked by a mysterious silhouette between a set of caravans! and the countless filler scenes involving actual circus outtakes of dancing poodles and highwire acrobats using a 'love rocket' apparatus!!.The climatic conclusion of BERSERK is riotous. When the killer is revealed laughter will ensue as their motives for murdering its victims come to light followed by a scene where they dash outside the circus tent only to be conveniently struck by lightning! Nothing in BERSERK quite makes sense but it is actually a rather amusing film. Crawford never looked better in her twilight years  although she would finally succumb to starring in nothing other than this kind of trashy fare. Watching her being seduced by Ty Hardin is a notch below completely embarrassing yet it is also at the same time completely hilarious. BERSERK is certainly among the dregs of misfired film projects but it isn't as bad as say a matinee showing on MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000.Crawford fans should give BERSERK a gander  I think you will be pleasantly surprised! My Rating  6 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "Joan Crawford is the lone notable hilight in this highly ridiculous yet entertaining popcorn fluff where a psychopath infiltrates and wreaks havoc upon a traveling circus troupe in Europe.Joan Crawford portrays the owner and ringmaster of the Circus The Great Rivers Circus  she is a gutsy feisty noholdsbarred woman who is hellbent on running her circus while a murderer terrorizes her employees by offing their victims in bizarre fashions. For example one tight rope walker is hanged by his own tightrope after it frays and snaps during a live performance  another man has a pick driven through his head and a woman is literally 'sawed' in half in a hilarious scene that involves a buzz saw and two missing screws !!.Meanwhile Crawford tries to capitalize on the murders by cashing in on the general public and their morbid fascination with death by making sure that the 'show must go on'. Box office receipts have never been better after the murders begin and the audience must wonder is Crawford behind it all? Is this just some sick overthetop publicity stunt?Further characters introduced into the story line include a hotshot tightrope walker Ty Hardin who also plays her love interest and future business partner a flirtatious blonde circus performer who tries to stir up trouble among her colleagues by implying that Crawford is the murderer and an incredibly ludicrous situation that allows the film to introduce Angela Crawford's mischiefmaking daughter who has just been expelled from an exclusive ladies college for her disruptive behavior.

	schema:reviewBody "Joan Crawford's fans will appreciate her foray into yet another horror show this time as the feisty hardedged manager of a traveling circus show suddenly burdened with murders of several circus members. The careful photography cannot hide the fact that Crawford has aged considerablyand consequently although her figure is still trim her scenes with hunky Ty Hardin have an unpleasant and unbelievable quality about them.The plot is strictly standard farewho is responsible for the series of gruesome murders?  For awhile it looks like Joan herself is probably the wicked oneand there are a few other red herrings to make you think you know who did it. When the ending is revealed in a climactic thunderstorm it comes as a distinct letdown although a surprise the reason being the guilty one is given no substance in the plot. The killer's identity seems highly implausible which makes the ending seem as though it has been merely tacked on to provide a final scene.As these sort of things go BERSERK isn't a bad way to pass the time on a lowbudget mystery. The technicolor is good Joan's costumes are fantastic her shapely legs are on almost constant display and she uses her haughty manner to great effect. The details of circus life are smoothly integrated into the story and some of the animal acts are amusingbut none of the characters have any depth. Ty Hardin makes a handsome and arrogant stud whose daredevil highwire act provides some high moments of suspense as he performs over a row of spikes below. Like Crawford he's given ample opportunities to show off his handsome physique.Diana Dors makes the most of her role as an outspoken tart and all of the supporting performances are competent enoughMichael Gough Judy Geeson and Robert Hardy. Certainly worth a view if you're a Crawford fan. The dialogue is ripe with campy oneliners.Trivia note The plot is slightly reminiscent of Barbara Stanwyck's LADY OF BURLESQUE where a series of backstage murders takes place with a slim plot involving a jealous performer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I'll admit this movie ain't Shakespeare nor is it likely to be confused with a Bergman or Fellini film! The movie like many of Joan Crawford's later films is highly entertaining but also high on the camp factorwith lots of suspense but also lots of overthetop action! It seems that after WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? that Crawford cheerfully accepted the schlocky direction her career turned and played it to the hiltstarring in some wonderfully clever suspense films like STRAIGHTJACKET and BERSERK! All these film are far from subtle and lowbudget but somehow in spite of their many shortcomings they entertain! Snobs and sophisticates may not think much of them but they deliver on the chills and action! This film casts Joan in a very odd role as the owner of a small circus and ringmaster. During the course of several months several performers die. At first it might just be accidental but when the business manager gets a tent spike driven through his head you know it ain't suicide! In fact for the kitsch film lover the many deaths in the film are all rather entertaining and sillya lady getting sawn in half a man being hung by a high wire rope a guy getting a knife in the back and falling to his death on a bed of swords! I tell you it's never dull! It's also very reminiscent of the Dr. Phibes films because of all the clever killings. In addition to a fun script and lots of shrill acting the film features some dandy real circus acts. I particularly loved the poodle actit's a real hoot.About the only letdown is the very end. How the murderer is exposed seemed a little too easy but how they soon died by accident shortly after this just seemed silly and anticlimactic. Other than the ending the only other negatives are seeing Joan in tights at 61 and her love affair with Ty Hardin who was significantly younger than her. I don't know if Ms. Crawford had anything to do with it but in several of her newer films she played characters way too old to be bedding such young men such as Hardin Jack Palance and Jeff Chandler.By the way for you Pepsi Watchers out there note the kid in the audience near the end of the film drinking Pepsi from a bottle. This is sort of an inside joke as Crawford was on the board of directors at Pepsi and insisted on sneaking a bottle into her films as often as possible. In her later films it's much like trying to spot Hitchcock in his filmsyou know that if you look closely enough it's bound to turn up somewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's very sad to see Joan Crawford reduced to appearing in this cheaply made and poorly written opus but she behaves like a STAR all the way through. Who else would have looked so good in a leotard at 62 years old? The film is set in a travelling circus in reality the UK's Billy Smarts Circus one of the best and biggest of its dayand much of the running time is taken up with showing the acts. As most UK circus acts are now animal free it's an interesting history lesson to see how these acts were actually presented. It's quite a breathtaking sight to watch a huge elephant step over half a dozen women prostrate on the floor and rather sad to see the lion tamer putting half a dozen snarling growling beasts through their paces. Just look at Joans expression as she helps lead out the performing poodles though she's loving every minute of it! We know that she had pet poodles of her own and she is really in her element here. The plot what there is of it doesn't bear too much scrutiny and the revelation of the killer and the motive are quite ridiculous. Also on the minus side of things are some poor performances  George Claydon in particular and a cringemaking musical comedy number which appears out of nowhere. There is also a hugely embarrassing scene with Crawford looking like an ancient ghost wearing shoulder length hair and a neck high negligee being romanced in her trailer by hunky Ty Hardin  she was 62 and he 37! On the plus side there are some great character actors appearing including the fabulous Diana Dors Michael Gough Ambrosine Phillpotts and Robert Hardy but only Diana Dors gives Crawford a run for her money. Overall this is still a fun film for Crawford fans but if you're going to watch it don't watch the trailer first as it shows every killing and even the death of the supposed murderer!".

Watch Joan cavort first with Michael Gough with lots of suggestions about their business and personal lives mergingfortunately for Gough this does not last too long as he soon finds himself nailed to another post. So with Gough gone heman Ty Hardin a new high wire act who arrives after the old one hangs himself while performing comes into the picture no shirt half the time and all and makes his moves for the lessthansexy sixty plus yearold. Watching Crawford and her beaus work with heavilyladen dialog laced with absurd innuendo was the highlight of this film as it was just so preposterous. She looks ancient and yet acts like she is still 25! Anyway the film itself is one of those films that is so very fun to watch just for those elements already mentioned the then grisly murders as circus people start to die off and the lush colour used in the film. The settings of the circus are believably done and Herman Cohen the producer always knew how to put on a good show. I even enjoyed some of the circus acts that were intermittently laced in the picture. The rest of the cast is very able with Gough always good and George Claydon playing Bruno excelling. Lovely Diana Dors and Judy Geeson also star. Hardin was really quite bad but I really enjoyed his trapeze act at the film's end. While the story can only be classified as silly and absurd the ending seems way too abrupt even for this film. The film seems to be going along almost effortlessly  Joan prancing about working her guys overYuck! and circus performers dying  then a quick ending that comes out of left field. Despite the many shortcomings Berserk  why the heck is it named that?  is a whole lot of fun and is very similar as some other reviewers have noted to StraightJacket Crawford's film for William Castle.".

The actors get through their lines professionally. Set in a circus the movie does a tolerably good job of showing performers of the class of freaks as responsible participants notably George Claydon.  Its best scene is when the character played by the ueberblonde Diana Dors barges in bottle in hand on shirtless Ty Hardin and he resists her close up.  For his own reasons he's set instead on Joan Crawford.  Joan was not a spring chicken by the time the movie was made if she ever was one she looks good in her ringmaster's costume running the circus she owns but someone should have helped her better with the red cloak she throws over her dowdy nightgown and told her never to let down her redtinted hair.  The real problem is that the movie never lets sparks fly between her and Ty Hardin.  It's not a question of age difference because look at Anna Magnani's triumphs over Burt Lancaster and Marlon Brando.  OK Joan Crawford in this movie has the additional handicap of playing a character hard as nails.  But a better script would have made the discrepancy of her motives tragic.  The last 10 minutes close things down in a pretty improbable way the last murder is not done by the same person as the others.  It would have helped to have ten more minutes for the Crawford character to be bereft and not berserk.  Meanwhile for those into it there are lots of circus acts that emphasize their risks.".

This gruesome death increases business so Monica is needless to say not to upset her star has gone to the big tent in the sky. There are several other wildly amusing murders and no one in the circus is safe. Is Monica the murderer or is she just an innocent victim next on the list? The one and only Joan Crawford wildly overacts as the circus owner Monica Rivers. She chews up the scenery as she torments the poor frightened circus performers. She looks pretty great in her Ringmaster's Costume even at 63 she had fantastic legs but it is stomach churning to see her love scenes with the hunky Ty Hardin who was young enough to be her son for God's sake!!!! The idea that any man would pick the aging Monica over the young and beautiful Matilda sluttily played to perfection by Diana Dorsis just too hard to fathom. Joan was just too old to pull this off yet somehow we are to believe that she has so much allure she can get any man she wants.The circus scenes go on WAAAAAAAAAAY too long endless scenes of leaping poodles and llamas running etc. They should have spent the time used on these pointless scenes developing the storyline more. There could have been a great movie here but it never quite comes together. Poor Joan had been reduced in her later years to playing the Grand Guignol and she does a fair job of it but the material is just too weak. The color of the film is vibrant and there are some creepy moments of Monica being stalked as she walks through the circus late at night but the ending is just too sudden and too abrupt. It left me wanting to know more of why the killer did what they did. There are some great campy scenes as well 2 women catfighting Joan making out with the young lover etc. but overall I would say this movie is for die hard Joan Crawford fans only.".

Once again we get the impression that Joan's character is supposed to be a few decades younger than Joan is giving you an odd feeling when the men in the film are directed to treat her as a sex object.Instead of a reformed murderess Joan portrays the bunwearing leotardclad owner of a traveling circus. Right away things start to go bad for the performers one guy is doing a highwire routine when the wire snaps and defying all laws of physics coils around the guy's neck and hangs him. Does this qualify him as a wire hanger? Berserk! piles on the gory deaths the most outrageous of which is when a character gets a spike driven through the back of his head and it erupts from his forehead. A scene where a woman was sawed in half would have been the most grisly were it not for the fact that there isn't a single drop of blood anywhere not even on the saw blade. A close runner up for most terrifying moment is when Joan and her studmuffin boy toy share a candlelight dinner in her trailer and he tells her I'm crazy about you. Oddly enough the writers played up to the StraitJacket legacy by having Joan's daughter turn out to be the killer even giving her a scene where she gets to really go berserk just like Diane Baker did. The script is short and padded into a feature length by the constant insertion of seemingly unending footage of circus acts. There's no real point to showing the circus acts. They don't advance the plot and who wants to watch a five minute elephant parade during a horror movie? There's also a meaningless musical number performed by the circus freaks with Tod Browning nowhere in sight. We want JOAN dammitJoan in a leotard baring her legs to the crotch. Joan with her hair in a severe bun that takes on the shape of a flaxen balls of yarn on top of her head. Joan slapping a nosy photographer and Joan pushing people out of her way. Joan flirting like a schoolgirl with a guy who might actually be young enough to be her grandson. She's the real cougar in this zoo of a circus film.Let's see since I already told you who the killer is I might as well go all the way and tell you that she doesn't get away with her crimes.

	schema:reviewBody "It's time for murder under the big top in this colorful campy sometimes bizarre horror flick. Poor Joan.....after the raging success of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? Bette Davis was able to continue working variably in fright films and meaningful dramas while Joan just kept slipping into worse and worse fare....eventually ending up acting opposite a short stunt man in an ape mask! Trog Here she is the authoritative owneroperator of a rather rinky dink circus which has fallen on hard times. Around the time a hunky drifter Hardin appears people start to get bumped off in increasingly violent ways. Joan maintains a pretty regal air throughout with a series of nice suits and especially her famous Edith Head ringmaster costume which displayed her still fit body but once she beds down Hardin things go off into the camp stratosphere! If it wasn't bad enough that she seduces a man 25 years her junior she had to outfit herself in a long exquisitely combed wig that sort of brings to mind what Robert Taylor would have looked like in drag in 1959. Bad call... The movie has some really draggy parts as ACTUAL circus performers are shown and SHOWN doing their thing. Unless you love watching vintage circus footage that Cecil B. DeMille would've slept through this part is deadly dull. Then there is a downright bizarre and insane musical number featuring 4 circus freaks who dance and sing and look directly into the camera! This must be seen to be believed. It also stalls the action tremendously. All is forgiven however when buxom Dors and another female get into a ripsnorting catfight on the ground. Joan breaks it up with a deep bark which is worth the price of admission right there. On another occasion she calls Dors a slut which is also a nugget of bad movie heaven! Then there are the sometimes creative and winceinducing murders which certainly hold one's attention. Fans of Mommie Dearest will find special appreciation of the scene in which Joan has to remove her daughter from boarding school. It's as if the authors of the biopic were more inspired by this fictional scene when scripting their film than whatever happened in real life! Geeson as the daughter seems to be merely a tool to show how devoted and beleaguered a mother Joan was in her own mind?. Maybe this is what ticked Christina off...especially when you see how bad her screen counterpart really winds up being! Hardin nicknamed Ty Hard On by one of his more saucy previous costars Diane McBain is nice to look at. This is a camp lover's paradise....others proceed at your own risk.".

Bad call... The movie has some really draggy parts as ACTUAL circus performers are shown and SHOWN doing their thing. Unless you love watching vintage circus footage that Cecil B. DeMille would've slept through this part is deadly dull. Then there is a downright bizarre and insane musical number featuring 4 circus freaks who dance and sing and look directly into the camera! This must be seen to be believed. It also stalls the action tremendously. All is forgiven however when buxom Dors and another female get into a ripsnorting catfight on the ground. Joan breaks it up with a deep bark which is worth the price of admission right there. On another occasion she calls Dors a slut which is also a nugget of bad movie heaven! Then there are the sometimes creative and winceinducing murders which certainly hold one's attention. Fans of Mommie Dearest will find special appreciation of the scene in which Joan has to remove her daughter from boarding school. It's as if the authors of the biopic were more inspired by this fictional scene when scripting their film than whatever happened in real life! Geeson as the daughter seems to be merely a tool to show how devoted and beleaguered a mother Joan was in her own mind?. Maybe this is what ticked Christina off...especially when you see how bad her screen counterpart really winds up being! Hardin nicknamed Ty Hard On by one of his more saucy previous costars Diane McBain is nice to look at. This is a camp lover's paradise....others proceed at your own risk.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sigh Sometimes the outcome of a movie viewing goes beyond being a mere disappointment or just something you expected more from. Sometimes it actually HURTS to acknowledge that a certain title wasn't as great as you initially thought or hoped. For me this was definitely the case with Berserk!. I'm a sucker for British horror movies released during the 60's and 70's I think a circus or carnival forms the absolute greatest setting to tell a sinister tale just think of Freaks Carnival of Souls and Santa Sangre and I'm a huge fan of both Joan Crawford and Michael Gough. Taking into account all these positive omens I honestly thought Berskerk! couldn't possibly go wrong and yet it did. You know you're in trouble when the extended padding sequences which actually don't contribute anything to the overall story form the highlights of the film. That's like openly admitting to the viewer that the main story lines are too thin to fill up the entire playtime or that they desperately need the padding in order to distract you from the incoherent and implausible plot. In Berserk! the padding footage serves both purposes. A lot of the circus acts albeit impressive are integrally shown like an army of poodles performing neat tricks elephant dancing a lion tamer and a knifethrowing act and the circus' freaks even sing an entire song from start to finish! Berserk! nevertheless opens splendidly with the tense and gruesome death of a tightrope walker before the opening credits even roll over the screen. His death might just have been an unfortunate accident but when a second and far more eminent member of the circus crew is murdered Scotland Yard sends its finest agent along on the tour to Liverpool and London. The circus' owner and ringmaster Mrs. Monica Rivers Joan Crawford wearing tights! is a harsh and relentless business woman and it looks as if someone intends to put her traveling circus spectacle in a bad spotlight. The concept literally bursts with great potential and possibilities but the film quickly becomes a tedious inane and totally illogical mess. After the second murder nothing even remotely exciting happens for nearly 45 minutes and the screenplay loosely hangs together through weak dialogs and Crawford's naturally uncanny presence. The revelation of the killer's identity as well as hisher motivation is downright imbecilic and you better not contemplate too much about how heshe was even capable of committing the vile crimes. The carnage should have been bloodier and more grotesque even considering the limited budget and era of release and the film totally lacks the mysterious and oddly unsettling ambiance of other contemporary circushorror efforts. Director Jim O'Connelly also made the fantastically overthetop demented horror gem Tower of Evil and since both films are rather obscure I recommend tracking down that one instead of Berserk!.".

Hardin would go on to join the Aryan Nation in the 1970s perhaps blaming the Jews who run Hollywood for his film noncareer. He should blame his mediocre looks and lack of talent instead. The circus acts are mildly entertaining the foppish detective investigating the murders is moderately amusing but the horror is for the most part pretty lame  the producers apparently didn't budget for much blood so only one or the murders is even remotely gory.

	schema:reviewBody "Berserk is not as dreadful as I had anticipated. It's a straightforward and reasonably entertaining whodunit set in a traveling circus in Britain. Overall I wouldn't call the pacing slow as others have but it is odd. At the beginning the story moves along briskly as the plot quickly thickens. Then periodically it breaks for extended circus acts that have no bearing on the story though it could be argued that since we are half expecting a new murder to occur at any moment we have no choice but to be attentive. Certainly this wouldn't be much of a film without the centerpiece Joan Crawford who delivers a forceful performance as the hardboiled boss of the circus. Over sixty her hair is dyed pinkish blonde and worn tightly pulled back to emphasize her still attractive facial features and possibly to lift the face and in half her scenes she is wearing a mistressofceremonies outfit with bare legs. She could still pull it off. But one notices several instances of Joan Crawford lighting that started in the 50s if not earlier in these instances the upper part of her face is high lit but there is a convenient shadow under the chin to deemphasize the sagging jawline. These days the average actress of 60plus has had surgical facelifts. The tone of her acting here is very much like the performance she gave around the same period on the CBS soap opera The Secret Storm in which she subbed for her ailing daughter who was a regular cast member of the show full throttle whether necessary or not  but you got your money's worth or at least felt you were being generously served by the performer.Ty Hardin as a high wire performer who sort of has the hots for Joan we really can't tell because the script coyly dances around the issue was on a career downturn at the time this was made and doesn't make much of an impression here. Diana Dors as an abrasive member of Crawford's troupe of performers enlivens every scene she's in. Just when you think she is stealing the film in steps Crawford to show everyone who's the Star. The production values are cheap but so well presented that they almost look expensive. Shooting actual circus acts lends an air of plausibility to the film as a whole that the script itself lacks and one can understand the logic of approaching the production from this angle. If you cut out all of the genuinely interesting circus material this would be very thin gruel indeed. The scoring is also peculiar. Usually it's parforthecourse sinistersuspenseful. But sometimes it veers off into a lush studio orchestra sound of the kind you'd expect to hear as underscoring to a scene of a limo gliding to a stop in front of a Beverly Hills mansion wherein Lana Turner is longing for love. This disconcerting shift occurs right after the dandy opening scene and credits.Crawford seems in her element here as a tough lady with responsibilities and she is the main reason to see the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "When a series of murders plagues a traveling circus the owner decides to carry on with performing which manages to continue on the legacy of bloodshed already unleashed and they must stop the madman before more performers are killed.When this one really tries there's some good stuff in it. What really helps this one is this is a more modernfeeling film with its general structure familiar themes and motives and even the fact that this one decides to spend time with a series of stalking occurring in the appropriate timeframe rather than hanging around Gothic castles or being back in the olden ages. Using the ploy of having a circus to entertain regular folks but keeping it still around in the more modern times really gives this one a much more appealing style throughout here. The deaths in here aren't that bad either and the scenery certainly provides plenty of opportunities for creative deaths. The two big ones center around the high wire acts in the film as one has the rope cut and then wrapped around the neck forcing the victim into a form of pendulum swinging over the stage while the other one where they are knocked off with a knife thrown into the stomach and falls off into a bed of razors below are both quite good and overall the other kills in here are just as fun. The last big positive is that this one really does show the magic and wonder of the circus. While nothing more than stretching the film out the fact that this one takes the time to show how the circus once was merely makes this one look all the better. These here are the film's good points while the flaws here are much more imposing. The main factor here is the fact that this one has a really terrible pace to it is one obstacle to overcome. Even though it's nice to be able to see why the circus was once so important this one suffers because it stops the film cold to showcase material that offers up nothing all that exciting. Seeing the main circus performances here in the film are just plain tortuous to sit through and they don't help the film at all. Another rather big flaw is that the film decides to really forego much in the way of logic or commonsense. The identity of the killer is mostly responsible for much of this. It's nearly impossible to figure out how the beginning murders were committed once the alibi is given. They don't match up at all and this is merely the beginning of them. Another minor flaw is the terrible musical number performed. Not only does this one also stop the film cold it's way too ludicrous to watch without laughing as the lipsynching displayed is way too obvious and the voices so completely outof place on them as well. It's still a really terrible scene and along with the other flaws really keeps this film down.Today's RatingPG13 Violence.".

Berserk! is a Bmovie thriller with excessive overacting and preposterous situations. Filled to the brim with ridiculous oneliners the script was probably shelved by whomever wrote itout of obvious embarrassment only to be unearthed later to become Berserk!. The best example of silliness it has to offer comes in the form of a suspenseful scene after the first murder in which all the circus performers gather to theorize who the perpetrator might be. The acting is so corny here. It actually occurred to me that the actors were reading from cue cards! If that wasn't bad enough the audience is expected to believe an attractive thirtysomething Ty Hardin is head over heels in love with 64yearold Crawford. Joan looks decent for a lady one year shy of her Medicare benefits but she's definitely not romance material for a man half her age. Joan's sense of style in this movie is also a flop. For some reason the wardrobe department saw fit to put her in a tacky emerald number that does nothing for her skin tone or complexion. Ugliest of all was the hair job. I can't fathom any hairstylist keeping a career going with taste that pathetic.MAJOR SPOILER AHEADAt last we discover who sent the nail through Man 1's head a scene by the way too funny to be missed and who sawed the girl in half. IT'S THE DAUGHTER! Oh wow. I am so shocked scandalized etc. First of all we don't know enough about the daughter to care at all. One moment she comes home from her exclusive school and the next she's 'fessing up to the murders? Excuse me did I miss something? Apparently a whole lot the writers didn't care to explain.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Of The MohicansThis is turning out to be one of my most favourite romantic epics of all time. I know most people do not see this as romantic as it is a classic battle movie. As a matter of fact seeing the trailer and the posters left me with the impression that this is indeed a war movie what with the battle scenes and all something along the lines of Braveheart'. But upon seeing the movie I was awed by the unexpected change in genre. The movie is a masterpiece and all the actors and actresses certainly do amazing jobs. Daniel Day Lewis is simply amazing as Hawkeye. Though I usually try to read some of the more interesting books based on which movies are made I haven't read the book in this case. But I sincerely doubt whether the book can be as good. Plus I am told that the movie and the book have little in common.Madeline Stowe is stunning as Cora Munro and Jodhi May was certainly impressive as the frail dependent younger sister. Nathaniel or Hawkeye' is the adopted son of  Chingachgook played by Russell Means whose real and lone son Uncas contributes to the team's claim of being the last of the Mohican clan. The British recruitment of Militia from its colonies during a time of war against France brings about a certain unrest. And it is further deepened by the character of Magua who is a Huron warrior bent on a personal vendetta against British Colonel Munro and his family. Magua is bent on the utter destruction of Colonel Munro and his two daughters hence wiping his seed from the earth'. Chingachgook and his two sons become entwined in between all this. To top that Nathaniel falls in love with Cora and their love story takes the show from there. It is sensually and emotionally stimulating and we as the audience feels engulfed in the mastery.The love story I liked better was the one played in the background an story that is absent yet strongly felt throughout the movie. I am referring to the love story between Eric Schweig's character Uncas and Alice Munro played by Jodhi May. It is the subtleness and the overtonenature of the love that builds in us a sense of involvement. To the best of my memory they never spoke a word to each other but the passion is strongly felt. And the climax really takes us to another level of appreciation.Wes Studi is probably the fiercest villain I have seen on screen. His mere presence builds an acute level of intimidation. The character portrayal is flawless and the casting done is excellent. I do not believe that anybody anybody at all could have replaced Wes in this movie. The fierceness the anger the viciousness the the everything required to build up the character He has done all that. Probably his best performance yet.The music is sort of unconventional. Usually the pace of the music is in sync with the pace of the action on screen. But in this case the same slow music floods the scenes whether the pace onscreen is fast or slow. If I had heard somebody else say that I certainly would have thought that it would not be effective. But amazingly this unconventional approach works. And how! The music is probably the most addictive feature about the movie. After the first time I saw it the music lingered in my mind for a month. All my waking moments my mind was echoing that brilliant piece of work. I am a very very huge fan of Hans Zimmer but I doubt if even he could have done a better job.I have seen the movie eight times to date. And I will definitely see it again. The climactic scene is so moving that I have lost count how many times I've seen that.".

Its vision of early America as it was during the French and Indian War is captured in its utter brutality and beauty complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures of everyone involved.This movie has a bit of everything including action romance war and passionate drama. The director Michael Mann knows the story well and does all but completely discard James Fenimore Cooper's source material which some have dubbed as being racist and totally unfair in its portrait of Native Americans.The story and what a story is all over the place with three frontier scouts  Hawkeye Daniel DayLewis Chingachgook Russell Means and Uncas Eric Schweig  escorting a British colonel's daughters  Cora and Alice Munro Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May respectively  to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward Steven Waddington rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeancedriven Huron named Magua Wes Studi seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children.This is by far Mann's best film yet it ranks 15 on my alltime favorite movies list and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious.This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy complete with the rivalries intrigue and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during this hectic time period.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "James Fenimore Cooper's trusty old nineteenth century novel 'The Last of the Mohicans' has provided a surprisingly sound springboard for a film that tries and succeeds in restoring a profound respect for the Native Americans. Yes it is a story about the Indians and their culture desecrated by the arrival of European entrepreneurs and colonists all relating to HawkeyeNathaniel Poe Daniel DayLewis who as a child was taken by the Mohawk tribe and raised by wise Chingachgook Russell Means with the graceful skills and philosophy of the Native Americans. And it is through his eyes that we are brought into the universe through the eyes of the Indians.The story is well known and needn't be elaborated once again. Suffice it say that Hawkeye becomes the scout who leads British family Munro including Colonel Maurice Roves and his daughters Cora Madeleine Stowe and Alice Jodhi May into upstate New York and along the way find altercations with the French and with the Huron Indians especially one Magua Wes Studi whose loathing for Munro's devastation of his village drives him to vengeance against the entire Munro family. Hawkeye and his ally Uncas Eric Schweig protect their lieges while steadfastly holding to the honor of their heritage. And of course during the harrowing events Hawkeye and Cora fall in love and Hawkeye takes great risks against his own life to ultimately defend Cora and her family.Yes there are many battle scenes great reenactment of the scenery of the novel and villains in all camps that provide the stormy progress of the novel. But it is in the quiet moments where Chingachgook speaks about the Great Spirit the sanctity of nature and his waiting to join the Great Council in the sky as the last of the Mohicans that the film's power is best communicated. The acting is very fine and the cinematography is splendid. This is a film worth seeing one whose 117 minutes fly by leaving the viewer with a renewed respect for Native American philosophy.

	schema:reviewBody "The Last of the Mohicans is a timeless tale of the 18th century frontier and the virtue and tragedy that results when the uniquely different cultures of the French English Native Americans and colonists collide.  Based on James Fenimore Cooper's literary genius The Last of the Mohicans transports the viewer back to a time of America's youth in a brilliant mesmerizing fashion.The story centers on an eclectic band of travelers thrust together by fate and their attempt to escape danger and reach the besieged British fort WilliamHenry.  Deep within the western forests of colonial New York Hawkeye the white adopted son and brother of the Mohicans tries desperately to avoid an everincreasing war.  He is forced to act when along with his Mohican father and brother he encounters two endangered sisters trying to reach their father a British colonel in command at the fort.  Hawkeye the rustic tracker and Cora the refined eldest daughter are naturally drawn together much to the dismay of Major Heyward an intriguing character who also vies for Cora's affections.  Tensions and passions arise between the characters as a whirlwind of conflict and violence rages around them.  In the end each character must face heartwrenching decisions that will affect their very lives and the lives of those around them.I especially love the way that the film depicts the perspectives of each of the groups involved.  Whether the group is competing for military superiority or simple existence in their homeland the viewer is given a true sense of their mindset in the midst of a great conflict.  It is difficult to say one side or the other is completely to blame for the events that take place.  Even the story's main antagonist Magua wonderfully portrayed by Wes Studi Dances with Wolves draws in a fair amount of empathy.The Last of the Mohicans is a marvelous visual adventure that thoroughly reveals the horrors of warfare the wildness of a chaste frontier and the fated and illfated romances of the characters involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "The year is 1757... The principal occupants of the region are Native Americans and a great diversity of wild life... It is the third year of the war between French and British for the possession of the continent somewhere on the frontier west of the Hudson River... The Mohicans are allied with the British while their old enemies the Hurons side with the French... There three men roam the forest making their living as frontier trappers and scouts... The first is Hawkeye a superb frontiersman raised by the Mohawk who can reload and fire a flintlock at full run the second is his adopted father Chingachgook the last of the Mohicans and the third his brother Uncas 'a warrior swift and straight as an arrow shot in the sun.'This trio seems have nothing to do with the early Colonial wars until they come upon the vengeful Magwa and his Huron war party as they attempt to slaughter the Munro sisters Cora and Alice heading with a small regiment of redcoats to meet up with their father Colonel Munro at Fort William Henry...Eventually the compassionate Mohican family comes to the rescue with a spectacular style of fighting... The film takes full advantage of their graphic capabilities with incredibly fast and fluid fighting action and mindblowing attack moves... Shortly thereafter two love stories take place... The three men lead the survivors to the English fort besieged by French forces and their Huron allies... The siege is a grand affair of roaring nighttime cannon and mortar attacks...Michael Mann's historical romance film gives a realistic picture of the frontier life and a vivid impression of the horrors of warfare in the wilderness at the time where the combatants often had time for one shot before being overpowered and reduced to handtohand fierce combat... The movie is filled with scenes of incredible brutal violence... It's warfare at a primal level... Academy Award Winner Daniel Day Lewis also known as The long rifle is splendid as Hawkeye the legendary warrior who encourages the Colonial militia to desert... He agrees to surrender in exchange for the life of two sisters and one British officer... He vows romantically to Cora that he will find her no matter how long it takes no matter how far...Madeleine Stowe manages to find in Cora's fiery character a balance between sensitivity and strength... War and tragedy swirl around her as she struggles to protect her man... Cora's attraction grows for the softspoken warrior who shows marked differences when compared to Major Heyward...Jodhi May is the blonde Alice Cora's younger timid sister... By that long shot of her innocent face  a portrait of extreme torment and despair  we are all aware of her sufferings... We sense more pain than she can cope with... May has almost no lines but her eyes brimming with tears are saying everything... No matter how much she wants to remain standing she was retreating further and further from the ugly face of Magua... Her heart was crying out in anger... We all know that she will do anything than surrender... Her breakdown turns the scene into a willpower for revenge..Russell Means is powerful as the Mohican elder Chingachgook... His running battle along that majestic ridge is some of the finest filmmaking we've seen in terms of action and intensity... There is no dialog in these moments but the scene leaves us certainly breathless.. Wes Studi is Magua the infamous Huron Indian who always speaks of himself in the third person... He is fluent in English French and Huron... Magua is a strong vibrant villain consumed with hatred... Magua plots the massacre of the retreating troops their women and children... Eric Schweig is Hawkeye's gentle and valiant brother Uncas... His quiet tenderness for Alice adds emotional weight to what could be passionate and unique... He asserts his mythic stature in a battle on a mountain top with Magua not only to determine the winner in a struggle between good and evil but also to decide the destiny of a race...Steven Waddington is the last survivor of a troop of English soldiers caught by France's Indian allies... He is a jealous and snobbish officer who wants the radiant Cora at any price... Heyward brings some realistic touches of duality showing his courage with one lifesaving act...Maurice Roves seems impotent as Munroe... His blindness to the realities of honor brings destruction... Patrice Chreau is the French General Montcalm who gives Magua the go ahead to attack Munro's retreating army... He begs Munrow not to sign the death warrant of so many and promises safe passage for the English so long as they return to England and fight no more on the continent...The real inspiration of 'The Last of the Mohicans' is the extraordinary action sequences the intensity of its music and the exotic romanticism of such 1930's adventures as 'Charge of the Light Brigade' 'Gunga Din' and 'The Lives of a Bengal Lancer' where unshaken heroes never hesitate in the face of savage adversaries...Michael Mann's camera exploits the beauty of the North Carolina mysterious Smoky Mountains its verdant forests and its whitewater rapids and waterfalls... The opening shot of the fog misting through the Smokies are enough to take your breath away...".

	schema:reviewBody "My all time favorite film. Still gives me chills. It's easily one of the most amazing films I've ever seen and it also features perhaps one of the greatest soundtracks ever. They way the music hits the scenes is just absolutely astonishing.In essence The Last of the Mohicans is an epic adventureromance set against the panorama of a frontier wilderness ravaged by the French and Indian War.Director Michael Mann brilliantly captures the essence of the era  1750'sthe handto hand battles the scalping's the harsh life in the wilderness etc. But I especially love the way that the film depicts the perspectives of each of the groups and the people involved. Whether they are competing for military superiority referring to the French General Montcalm  Patrice Chreau  and the British Colonel Munro Maurice Roves or the simple existence of peoples in their homeland the viewer is given a true sense of their mindset in the midst of a great conflict.Even the story's main antagonist Magua wonderfully portrayed by Wes Studi draws us in.The always amazing Daniel DayLewis stars as Hawkeye rugged frontiersman and adopted son of the Mohicans. DayLewis with flowing mane and heaving pecs makes a virile but sensitive hero for the screen and Madeline Stowe is Cora Munro aristocratic daughter of the proud British Colonel Munro. Stowe manages to find in Cora a fiery balance between sensitivity and strength. One can't help but feel fascinated and or captivated by her dark eyes and flowing dark hair.Generally the film tells the story of Hawkeye and Cora Munro two people who meet across cultural and class barriers and are presented serious new challenges.But the film has so more. For example the contrasts between the two brothers  Hawkeye and Uncas and the two sisters  Cora and Alice. Hawkeye being the more daring and outspoken from the start. He dares to approach the dark haired Cora when he was drawn to her where as Uncas Eric Schweig never openly reveals his attraction to Alice  Jodhi May. Besides those short simple looks and glances.But then again do we really need lines? No. Both Schweig and May have very few lines but it is their eyes that are saying everything... Case in point that sequence in the cave where Uncas pulls Alice back from the falls and holds her.All in all I have to honestly say that the last 40 or 50 minutes or so of this movie are just completely off the hook. I'd wager it might start along the lines of hearing that huge Huron war party cry as the British Army retreats from Ft. William Henry. This leads to Hawkeye vow to rescue Cora no matter what in the scene that takes place behind the waterfall. This is a scene that has been copied and mimicked by many others  notably Tom Cruise in M12 but the way DayLewis delivers the line You stay alive no matter what occurs! I will find you. No matter how long it takes no matter how far I will find you simply makes you believe him.Another amazing sequence would be when our heroes are running up the hill to save Cora Alice and the British Maj. Duncan Heyward Steven Waddington after they've been captured. For whatever reason the Directors Expanded DVD emits the haunting Clannad song I Will Find You. Why this isn't heard during the scene is beyond me.I've watched this film way too many times now but easily it is the last 15 minutes that are the most powerful and emotionally devastating. For instance just watch the way the sequence of music starts with Duncan shouting take her and get out you know that something serious is going to happen and Duncan is doomed......Or the scene of Uncas's and then Alice's shocking deaths. I've always viewed the later scene as the first time Alice takes control of her own destiny and chooses not to be a victim. She finally snaps out of her shockinduced haze and takes action. Her choice of suicide is made from a place of strength.But it is also the more quiet of moments that simply resonate. For instance when Chingachgook  Russell Means speaks about being the Last of his tribe.A film that truly resonates. No matter the age or the mood.".

Just a great great movie.It boasts an interesting story filled with intense characters beautiful scenery a fantastic score good action and a nice romance. So....there is a lot to like about this Michael Manndirected film.The action scenes are quite realistic and border on being almost too prevalent to be fair. However even if it may be a little too intense or frequent the action is always interesting and varied from allout assaults to individual battles.The story takes place in Eastern New York State but in reality was filmed in beautiful Smokey Mountain areas in Asheville N.C. This movie looks spectacular and with an epic sweeping soundtrack is quite a feast for the eyes and ears.The eye candy includes a handsome leading couple Daniel DayLewis and Madeline Stowe. Wes Studi is mesmerizing as the bad guy. If you liked him in Geronimo An American Legend you'll like his work here.If you are fairly young and only know Michael Mann through his crime movies like Heat or Collateral please check this earlier film out. It could be Mann's best which is saying a lot.".

First of all I truly appreciated the more balanced portrayal of the native American tribes. Previous films often displayed the tribes as bumbling savages with no moral sense and the 'white man' always taking the moral high ground. Michael Mann showed the equal amount of savagery that men from all walks of life are capable of and the universal lack of compassion often abundant in times of war.The directing style is rich and Mann knows how to affect the audience's mood with his use of perspectives. The acting and music was superb. My only issue with the whole film was the limited shots of Uncas whom I thought was just as interesting a character as Hawkeye!9 of 10".

I don't think there are enough adjectives to describe this movie or the effect it has had on me. Incredible. Soulstirring. Heartrendering. Amazingly hopeful. Gloriously Sad. It has two of the greatest love stories ever seen on screen both yearning smoldering and heart wrenching and yet so different and subtle I won't say more. The battle scenes are violent and brutal but not gratuitously realism is no issue here you are transported to another world and the actors have clearly thrown themselves into it as well. The period is meticulously and perfectly recreated in incredible detail. The scenery is almost as engaging as the action itself and the score is so perfectly descriptive of the stunning visuals that your spirit actually soars with it. Sorry to be so corny but nothing else justifies it. The final 25 minutes are in my opinion the greatest 25 minutes ever filmed. Without spoiling it let me just forewarn get the tissues. I have watched this movie 6 times in the past 48 hours. Don't wait get hooked now!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film for reasons that are not completely obvious to me struck a chord. It was in part the amazing location shots partly the characters partly the music and the action sequences. As for the relatively underdeveloped romance between the hero and heroine  all I can say is that the line that Hawkeye delivers when Cora Munro challenges this rough colonial who has the temerity to gaze upon her a colonel's daughter and says essentially 'Who are you looking at?' Hawkeye answers 'You Ma'am. I'm looking at you.' Priceless.Interestingly archeologists have recently excavated the site of Fort William Henry and discovered many interesting things none of which contradict the events described by Fenimore Cooper. The attack on the defeated column in the woods also appears to be historically accurate.This film though imperfect ranks with me as one of the best action movies of all time.".

Along with adoptive brother Uncas the three are swept into the French and Indian war of 1757 treading lightly between the antagonists French and Hurons on one side British and colonials on the other each faction potentially treacherous and deadly.Mann doesn't waste time on exposition or character development he just hurls us into the fastpaced brutal action and the effect is like snagging the tail of a galloping racehorse and trying to hang on to the finish line. Madeline Stowe and Jodhi May as sisters of the British major Munro provide love interest for Hawkeye and Uncas respectively. Steven Waddington is another Redcoat officer infatuated with Stowe and he too shines as a 'bad guy' who's more complex than he at first seems. But the movie's almost stolen by Wes Studi as Magua a Huron warrior who's allied himself with the French solely as a means to avenge himself on the white man. He's as mesmerizing and lethal as a cobra.Technical qualities are exemplary with special mention to the magnificent scenery of oldgrowth forestlands and mountains in North Carolina and a superb score by Trevor Jones with an assist by Randy Edelman.Mann might not be the first guy you'd think of to stage an 18thcentury period actionadventureromance. But after seeing what he does here no one can fail to be impressed by his range and bravura. This is a mustown.".

	schema:reviewBody "It used to baffle me why this film hasn't been held in greater esteem. I was blown away by this film when I first saw it and knew quite a few people who snuck back to the theater several times for more. The beautiful and harsh scenery dreamlike photography sudden explosions of bloody violence and raging overthetop passion amid a collapsing world create a pure emotional rush. This is melodrama at its best which means that it can really stir your emotions if you let it.After reading a recent review of Ron Howard's The Missing by Steve Sailer Washington Times I think I know why Last of the Mohicans was overlooked. No matter how good this film was it bucked the dominant trend in popculture perceptions of Native Americans at the time  a trend according to Sailer that might be reversing. Here's a historical breakdown of trends in similar films1. 19501970  Native Americans are onedimensional easily killed comicbook villians. No religious elements appear. There are only a few exceptions to this rule e.g. John Ford's The Searchers.2. 1970s  Native American violence becomes brutal and real  but we also get rising sensitivity to Native Anericans without much sappyness. To quote Sailer'The Missing' resembles 'Ulzana's Raid' the 1972 Burt Lancaster film that was one of several brutal but realistic films such as 1970's 'A Man Called Horse' made during a brief period of balance in the depiction of Native Americans falling between the earlier era's antiIndian prejudice and the present day's happyclappy New Age nonsense.In other words if Last of the Mohicans had been released in 1970 it might have been hailed as progressive.3. 1980s and 1990s  Religiousspiritual interpretations of Native Americans become dominant but are just as comicbook as the old 1950s violence. Native Americans are cute New Age Dances With Wolves icons that sit around and act wise. Native American becames an alwaysgood point of reference in the Culture Wars. Classic example from South Park an old hippie screams in front of a new Starbuck's...how many Native Americans did you slaughter to make that coffee shop?Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans 1992 clearly ran counter to the 1990s trend  it was trashed by critics at the time but I've always felt it was a much better film than it is given credit for even a classic. But it bucks the New Age image of Native Americans so popular in 1992. For example the old chief at the end uses his spiritual authority to make a brutal violent decision for death so that justice is served. The Native American father Chingagchook kills the revenge and powermad Magua without pity. And as for Magua's own behavior...nobody on either side is asking ...can't we all just get along?In other words Mann picked the exact wrong time to make this film. In the 1970s it might have been properly recognized but by 1992 it was out of step with the touchyfeely image of Native Americans. Coupled with its obvious melodrama and actionfilm hype the film became too much of a guilty pleasure to win praise but don't let that stop you now.Movies are changing again and that might be a good reason to go out and rent Last of the Mohicans.  According to Sailer the dark side of Native American spiritualism is now being seen in Missing. Like Mohicans Howard's new film loses the New Age stuff for a dreamlike actionhorror state. The scenes below have their obvious parallels in MohicansBlanchett finds her boyfriend's charred corpse strung up over a campfire where the Indians slowly roasted him to death. Later when a photographer snaps the Apache leader's picture the shaman gets his soul back by tearing out the man's heart.The other problem with Mohicans was that it is too manly. There's a very strong female lead but the men are also real lusty nasty men. By including this brand of passion Mohicans conflicted directly with the girl power pop culture trend of the mid1990s. Admitting you liked the film made you antiwoman as well as anti Native American.In this light consider Sailer's comments on Missing  they apply equally to MohicansStill I have to admire Howard for ignoring the bogus and condescending fantasies about American Indian culture rampant in our society today. Native Americans have suffered enough without having the memory of their warriors emasculated by selfabsorbed ecofeminists into sappy symbols. Geronimo was a cruel man but he was every inch a man.We may be on the edge of a revival of films which are capable of mixing Native Americans violence and romance in a good way. If so the underappreciated Last of the Mohicans is a place to start.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thorougly enjoyed this film and it is most certainly my favorite. It is extremely well directed by Michael Mann and there is not one actress or actor in the film that in my opinion did not perform extremely well. The location of the settings were well chosen and extremely beautiful and the soundtrack was a haunting melody better than any other I have ever heard in a film. I enjoyed this even more than Braveheart And I am not biased against Braveheart because I see it is a story and not as antienglish propaganda like some. This film is a timeless classic filled with gutwrenching action a wonderful romance and ontheedge battle scenes.I particularly admired the performance of Jodhi May who was only 16 at the time of filming as Alice Munro. Her perfomance was quite amazing especially towards the end in the way that she said nothing but the facial expressions were so real that one could just about believe that it was real and not just a story! This scene was the best of one of the best films I have ever seen and I have remembered it ever since. The music was an amazing haunting celtic type during this scene and it fits perfectly when the beautiful Alice Munro falls to her death next to her lover. This has left me thinking about the character and her motives for doing this for some time and this entire film sticks in one's mind as a very good film should do. The perfomance of Daniel DayLewis and Cora was also gripping and excellent and Madeliene Stowe as Cora is one of the most beautiful actresses. My only gripe for Cora was that her English accent was a little nowyouseeit nowyoudon't.I would give this film 11 out of 10 if it was possible. Read the book too Although the film is quite different James Fennimore Copper's classic is also a brilliant piece of work and I hope he would have been proud of this so excellent film. If films like Braveheart and Gladiator are you types of film then watch this. 1010".

This film is a masterpiece. I have seen it about 30 times and will probably watch it another 50. It is so deeply moving and stirring I can not describe it. It is above review and words will only fail it.It is an incredible epic passionate romantic love story. Not an action adventure as IMDb calls it.It is very painful to watch this film because of the deep sense of longing to be that man in the story who gets to be with this woman and survives this extreme experience of being so intensely alive. This is a film that must be seen. Descriptions are pointless. Every aspect is a masterpiece. The acting the casting the music everything. The fact that this is rated a 7.3 on IMDb as of when I write this is absolutely disturbing proof that most people are utterly oblivious and bereft of any sense of art or beauty. One thing I must say is that while Daniel Day Lewis and Wes Studi were both incredible it was Madeleine Stowe who made this film. I just can't describe her. I came on here considering writing a review for The Revenant 2015 and just started thinking of how many orders of magnitude better the Last of the Mohicans was. So I came here to write this instead. A 10 is not excellent to me IMDB says 10 is excellent. To me 10 means masterpiece. Only about 1 in 1000 films is a masterpiece. This is one of them.".

Montcalm knowing of Magua's lust for revenge knows that he will then attack the defeated inhabitants as they leave the fort.That scene is sheer poetic license as the facts bear out that Montcalm had assurances from the Indian chiefs after that battle that they would refrain from attacking the departing party in exchange for all the forts plunder.

No I'm not French but all books and letters show Montcalm as a man of highest honor and a champion against greed and corruption.";

	schema:reviewBody "First I saw the movie and got excited by the beautiful backdrop scenery. Then I found out that the two main historical events depicted the siege and fall of Fort William Henry and the subsequent massacre actually happened. So I saw the movie again. Then I read the book. Then I read a good book about the French and Indian War.This is an instance where the movie deviates from the book and is the better for it. Then I'm pleased with the fact that history wasn't tampered with at least not too much. Historians aren't sure how the Fort William Henry massacre was triggered or how complete it was it IS documented that the massacre actually happened. I find no historical record of Colonel Munro conducting any campaign of lodgeburning against the Huron but then again it IS documented that Munro did not have any daughters. Those characters are in the book as well as the movie. Cooper invented them himself. The idea of Huron war parties raiding on the frontier doesn't pop up in the book or the historical record but it's perfectly plausible the native Americans fought that way all through the Coloinal period. The savagery of Native American warfare is depicted fairly accurately all accounts I have confirm that. The concept of taking captives is depicted accurately too for the reasons described.Being of the bent that I am I find the dual love stories involving 1 the Cora MunroHawkeyeMajor Heywood triangle and 2 the UncasAlice Munro relationship all well and good they were done well enough. I was more fascinated by the historical backdrop and the very nice North Carolina scenery which is supposed to mimic the Adirondacks where the story is set. For those with time on their hands and money to spend both Fort William Henry and Fort Carillon better known as Fort Ticonderog exist they have been fully restored and are now historical museums. I visited Fort Ticonderoga when I was 12 years old and found it fascinating. Now that I've seen this movie I want to go out that way again start at Fort William and Henry and work my way North to Crown Point learning all I can on the way.What I really recommend is to see the movie once enjoying the scenery and the love stories as well as the action. Then read The French and Indian War Deciding the Fate of North America by Walter R. Borneman. Then see the movie again from a different perspective.".

I mentioned that the review we were seeing South Pacific that the story in the musical did not stand the test of time.  However the Godfather does and The Last of the Mohicans is one movie I cannot tear myself away from.

	schema:reviewBody "Romance action and hope.  Emotion without sentiment.  Love interest without explicit sex scenes.  An excellent film and one of my absolute favorites.  I had read all of James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking series as a kid and had seen the '36 version with Randolph Scott.  But this film got me from the gitgo.  I suppose reading those books seeing that old film it was old when I saw it as a kid having been made and released a year before I was born and reading everything else about Red Indians now appropriately called Native Americans I could get my hands on contributed to my becoming an anthropologist.  But in spite of Mark Twain's scathing critiques of the Leatherstocking series I don't think Twain liked JF Cooper's face they were exciting to me as a kid. And this film was exciting to me as an adult. The story here only conforms to the skeleton of the original but the presentation is convincing and authentic.  The performances of the Native American actors the delightful Wes Studi Russell Means Eric Sweig and Dennis Banks are wonderful.  Small parts are also seen with character actors Pete Postelthwaite and Colm Meany and the rival Duncan Heyward is given a pompous twist by Brit Actor Steven Waddington.  The Munro girls with Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May are likewise delightful with Stowe inserting a bit of early feminism into her role.  May's fawnlike big eyes suggesting a delicate vulnerability lends itself well.  The romantic interest with the handsome young Uncas is not as well developed as it was in the '36 version but that's not a failing.  All in all this film has become one of my all time favorites.  I've seen it at least 6 times and plan to see it at least that many times more this year.".

	schema:headline " A stunning war picture with amazing performances from all of the hundreds of actors involved The Last of the Mohicans is a near flawless presentation of warlife in the 1700s.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Last of the Mohicans is an epic portrayal of the conflicting interests of the French the British and the Native Americans in colonial America. The French and the Native Americans are allies but the film throws in some completely unexpected and surprisingly effective plot twists toward the end something that is relatively uncommon in period films. Mixed in with the adventurous atmosphere of war is a powerful romance that develops between Hawkeye Daniel DayLewis and Cora Munro Madeleine Stowe who play two characters very unlikely to fall in love. Hawkeye was adopted by the Mohicans as an infant and was raised by them for his entire life since then. Cora is the daughter of a British Colonel and their romance is strikingly effective and made even better by the settings. I think that the romance is especially notable here because usually and especially in action or adventure films whenever there is a significant romantic subplot it usually seems to have been thrown in relatively clumsily and with the obvious objective of making the film appeal to a larger audience.  However in The Last of the Mohicans the romance is so well developed and so well acted that this is clearly not the case. Every part of the story in this film including the romantic subplot fit together flawlessly resulting in a topnotch historical action drama.Even better than the incredible performances and the fascinating story is the breathtaking cinematography and onlocation settings. The film is literally packed full of amazing shots of the endless and stunningly beautiful colonial American countryside. This is one of the ways that the film is able to flawlessly bring the 1700s back to life with incredible reality. The film is beautifully shot by director Michael Mann whose films seem to be getting better and better. Another thing that was done noticeably well in this film was the editing particularly in the fastpaced and excellently executed battle scenes which were brutal but rightfully so. I've always thought that the only excuse for excessive violence is if it's true and this is the kind of thing that went on when this country was founded. The notable thing here is not how much violence there was but how spectacular the presentation of history is and in such a convincingly realistic way. spoilers The Last of the Mohicans is a look at a certain point in history as one point in a huge timeline. This is the revelation that makes the ending to the film one of the best endings in any film in years. The closing line Once we were here' is an acquiescent observation that no matter how hard they fight the Mohicans will be gone someday as will be the frontier itself and a different people will someday inhabit the land. Such is the way that the world goes things change nothing lasts forever but there are some who are willing to accept that and be proud of whatever mark they have made. THIS is how great films are made.".

A scene of Cora and Hawk locked together while the waterfall rages beyond them is so beautiful.For villains you just want to see get ripped to pieces actor Wes Studi brings to life the war Chief Magua not many villains can hold a candle to this guys psychosis he literally cuts a guys heart out and its as casual to him as ordering Chinese food.For action genre fans the final mountainledge showdown will bring a tear to your eye as Magua and his braves break out the tomahawks and have a chopathon with Hawkeye and his guys.Every actor in this film is a joy to watch but pay close attention to Jodi May who plays Cora's sister Alice.

From the opening frame to the closing shots this modern epic satisfies on every level resonating with heart and scale drama and action. It is a film of haunting beauty and profound feeling with a pace that is unequalled in the genre. It positively oozes charisma.The cast disappear into their roles and for a period film that is now over 15 years old there isn't the slightest hint of it dating. There is nothing superfluous here but nothing is left wanting either. This is a credit to the skill of the entire crew. Everything works  the locations sets costumes editing sound music tone writing direction performances everything. Daniel DayLewis and Madeleine Stowe generate chemistry with rich but scant material while the other main players give such refined performances that the viewer is simply swept along. And this film is sweeping in every sense. Whatever the accuracy in comparison with the original text this film becomes a text in its own right and is so delicately crafted and magnificently edited that the final scenes play with virtually no dialogue and powerfully so. This has a lot to do with the stunning score  the last ten minutes demonstrating all aspects of cinema operating on the highest level  as it reinforces the primal beat and rhythm of the piece while still maintaining a colonial heart and hauntingly epic sweep.The Last of the Mohicans is a thrilling fierce adventure tempered with attention to historical detail heightened yet not melodramatic emotion and a sympathetic yet seethingly tense depiction of the time. An adventure epic with a lot of soul and heart. It's time for Mann to return to the epic genre and demonstrate once again what he can do as evidenced by this overlooked classic.

	schema:headline " Wiseman's first film";
	schema:reviewBody "Titicut Follies is a controversial documentary by Frederick Wiseman. The film records events at the Bridgewater State Prison For the Criminally Insane. It was shot in 1967 but was subjected to a worldwide ban until 1992. The Judicial Court ruled that the film was an invasion of inmate privacy but in reality Wiseman had been granted full permission to film at the prison. The ban was merely an attempt by the authorities to silence the uneasy truths that Wiseman's camera had uncovered.Wiseman is oft said to be of the leading proponents of cinma verit. His films have no narration music or titles. He simply observes his subjects with cool clinical detachment. Whatever Wiseman records the viewer is left to interpret for themselves. Nothing is explained.Along with Emile de Antonio Wiseman is one of the godfathers of documentary cinema. Throughout his career he'd established the standard for what is now known as observational or objective documentary filmmaking. Unfortunately this tag obfuscates the many symbolic didactic and engineered contrasts found in Wiseman's films. Wiseman's films aren't strictly objective. They have points to make and are never free of his subjective biases.Unlike many documentary filmmakers Wiseman's films all focus on institutions. His subjects are whole organisations and he typically generates drama by simply observing the various cogs and people at work within these societal machines. High schools welfare offices zoos hospitals ballet groups army basic training camps small towns ICBM bases and business corporations are just some of the institutions he's tackled.With Titicut Follies Wiseman goes behind the walls of a Massachusetts Mental Institution and exposes the treatment of inmates by guards and social workers. The footage he shoots is both macabre and revolting. The mental institution pretends to be a place of logic and the scientific method but Wiseman reveals it to be a place of chaos and absurdity. Patients are deemed mentally unsound simply for not conforming to the institution's absurd standards. They're routinely teased and bullied and left to roam the corridors completely naked. One articulate patient attempts to get his doctor to explain why he's being imprisoned but the doctor has no answer.Several inmates one a socialist and the other an intelligent Russian seem to be in the institution for political reasons. Both are of sound mind but because they sympathise with the communist cause and distrust American's involvement in Vietnam they've been labelled paranoid schizophrenics and jailed indefinitely.The hardest scene to watch is of a forced feeding. A doctor smokes a cigarette as he inserts a long rubber tube into a patient's nostril and pours soup into a funnel. Halfway into the procedure the doctor's cigarette falls into the funnel. In a surprisingly heavy handed directorial intrusion Wiseman intercuts this painful scene with glimpses of the patient's corpse being prepared for burial.Frederick Wiseman is a curious case in cinema. You can arguably group modernist brain cinema into two categories left brain artists and right brain artists. Left brain artists Antonioni Kubrick Bresson Haneke etc are very rare. They're logical sequential rational analytical objective and look at things in terms of parts units or sections.Right brain artists are more common. They're intuitive holistic synthesising subjective and look at wholes. They like randomness and communities. Altman John Sayles Spike Lee Fassbinder Wenders Malle Fellini and Lynch are good examples.Wiseman's form is very much like a Stanley Kubrick film. He sees his subjects in terms of sections and parts. In terms of machines and larger constructs. His camera is always distant detached and objective. One can see echoes of Full Metal Jacket in Wiseman's Basic Training and 2001 in Zoo.But behind this is an artist who seems to embrace improvisation and chaos. Wiseman works fast with a single camera and a simple microphone. He catches what he can without purpose and plan sculpting his films entirely in the moment. This lends his films when viewed together a strange feel. You get the sense of large social constructs giant institutions and sprawling communities machine like in their workings and routines and yet within these machines Wiseman captures fleeting glimpses of humanity spontaneous and wild.810  This is a nightmarish little film. It's not as great as some of Wiseman's later flicks but it is perhaps his most influential. To this day it remains the only movie in U.S. history to be banned for reasons other than obscenity or national security. Director Milos Foreman would screen Titicut Follies for his crew prior to making One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Paddy Chayevsky would base The Hospital on Wiseman's Hospital. Makes a good companionpiece to Wiseman's Near Death.".

They were likely using the same treatment methods since the 1920's. One interesting note I met one of the patients who was in the film. He had been released and apparently was doing well enough.

They are shown naked being provoked into angry outbursts by the guards forcefed locked in solitary confinement naked with a metal bucket for a toilet and hundreds of other indignities.  Even the fact that the filmmakers had such access is a shocking violation since patients committed involuntarily are unable to give informed consent. But this was made in 1967 before modern antipsychotic medications were developed.  As a Clinical Social Worker who has worked extensively with the chronic mentally ill over the last decade I was shocked to see how primitive the treatment methods were even though I was prepared by my research in graduate school.  Tranquilizers were being prescribed to mitigate the symptoms of paranoia the psychiatric interviews with patients included lots of leading questions and they were treated rudely and dismissively even when the patients were making some good points about their commitments.It was obvious that the staff and volunteers were just doing the best they could but I have less sympathy for the Hungarian psychiatrist who at times seemed as disturbed as his patients.  The volunteers running games and parties and shows reminded me of the Friendly Visitors to the Poor those wellintentioned 19th C. socialites who volunteered to sing hymns and read the Christian bible to poor people in the tenements to improve their lives.  All in all this is a very worthwhile film and highly recommended to professionals and interested others in the mental health field.  Yes there are some definite ethical problems in the way this was created but as a historical record it is invaluable.  I give this 910.".

There are no interviews no narrator and there doesn't appear to be any real slant to the film. Instead it is a cold and voyeuristic view into the activities and practices of the inmates and their caretakers within a 1960s mental institution...Throughout the film we get a glimpse of the daily lives of the doctors and nurses guards and inmates of the Bridgewater State mental hospital in Massachusettes. We watch as the guards and patients interact and as the patients interact amongst themselves. There doesn't appear to be any real bias to the film other than to show the conditions that these individuals all coexist in. The hospital seems to be filled with every type of mentally disturbed individual  from pedophiles to Tourettes sufferers to schizophrenics to the severely mentally retarded. The camera captures the action unrelentingly and in graphic detail.Many find TITICUT FOLLIES disturbing due to the treatment of the patients. I for one found most of the guards and doctors to be relatively humane and compassionate given the circumstances. The only instance I considered to be abusive was when one guard taunted an inmate about cleaning his room. He was obviously getting some sort of kick out of upsetting the old man which I found rather sad and sadistic. Of the other scenes in the film I didn't see any instances of what I would personally consider physical abuse  though the living arrangements for the inmates left much to be desired. The inmates were often left in completely bare rooms totally naked. I assume it's so they wouldn't hurt themselves but it still seemed animalistic. Another key scene that several other reviewers have focused on is the forcefeeding of an inmate which while unpleasant I found to be necessary as it's noted that the person hadn't eaten in three days. At that point I don't see any other option except to allow the person to starve to death  and I doubt anyone would consider that option all that humane either.Unfortunately these types of mentally disturbed individuals still live in similar circumstances today  having medications forced on them and living in a depressing nearly comatose state for the majority of their lives in harsh institutions. I personally know people who have spent time in mental and rehabilitation institutions and from their retelling it doesn't seem that any great strides have been made in either the care or rehabilitation of those that suffer from serious mental issues. I don't necessarily blame this on the doctors or the facilities involved as I'm sure that many of them do their utmost to help those that have these afflictions  I just don't think there's adequate knowledge of the human mind to be able to fix these individuals.TITICUT FOLLIES is worth seeing to those that appreciate tough films  it's definitely not a laughaminute joyride.

	schema:reviewBody "I've long been interested in the issue of ethics in documentary films. No more is this question better discussed than with the controversial films of Frederick Wiseman.  Although I myself am a big Wiseman fan I can see how one can question his methods.  My purpose here is not to defend his methods and certainly not to condemn them but merely discuss some ethical issues.     A good place to begin this discussion would be with Wiseman's first film Titticut Follies.  The film is a record of the goings on inside the Bridgewater Massachusetts State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and is very disturbing to watch.  One of the most famous sequences involves the intercutting of two scenes.  In one scene a patient is being force fed through a tube.  In the intercut scene shows the embalming of the very same patient.  Both scenes are very graphic the former including a shot of a cigarette held by one of the doctors as the ash looks as it might drop into the tube used to feed the patient.  Just by intercutting these two scenes it seems to be clear what Wiseman is saying that the patient even when alive is not treated as a real live person but merely as a living corpse.  Some might see this as being manipulative or that Wiseman is not giving the patient any dignity by showing what is happening to him.  But by showing the event it could also be said that Wiseman is on the patient's side by illustrating the doctors attitudes towards him. In an article in Sight and Sound magazine Thomas R. Atkins writes Titticut Follies may appear onesided at first largely because most viewers are almost totally unfamiliar with the subject but Wiseman has carefully presented the differing arguments about Bridgewater.       As if to back him up Richard Schickel in Life magazine after listing a series of examples in which we are encouraged to identify or at least sympathize with the inmates writes  A similar identification is felt with the good folks of prison societythe roughhewn but kindly head guard the volunteer worker who somehow manages to organize a game of  'pin the tail on the donkey' without selfconsciousness or patronization the simpleheated nurse who finds her reward in a thankyou letter form a released inmate.       Here we get the sense that even though he has shown us the inmates in a sympathetic light and the employees in an unfavorable light he is evening things out by showing us sympathetic images of other employees implying that he his honestly trying to give a balanced view of the place.".

	schema:reviewBody "All I ever read about is how disturbing and controversial Titicut Follies is and how the Surpreme Court commanded to ban the film and prevent further distribution because it was and still is an embarrassment for the Law in the state of Massachusetts. Okay it may be disturbing but it primarily is a truly saddening  depressing documentary that depicts real human beings in some of the most humiliation footage ever shot on camera. The controversial impact of Titicut Follies is actually some sort of paradox to itself. One could state that the atrocious and inhumanly cruel behavior of the guards  doctors at the Bridgewater Institution urgently needed to be made public but on the other hand you could also easily claim that Frederick Wiseman gratuitously spread humiliation footage of defenseless mental patients on a large scale. If you stumbled upon the page of this film I presume you already know this documentary illustrates  in shocking and occasionally painful details  how the mental patients at the Massachusetts Bridgewater State Hospital are mistreated and bullied by the staff members. The patients varying from catatonic people to paranoid and severely suicidal human beings are humiliated and mocked resulting in extended images of mentally disabled people shouting and raving around their rooms naked. Wiseman may have had the permission of the patients' relatives andor their legal guardians to use the footage but who is he to exploit these poor people's lamentable living conditions to make a statement about the contemporary incompetent medical treatment of mental patients? I heavily appreciate this documentary because it caused a huge scandal and undoubtedly influenced the future of medicine in a good way but maybe the footage never should have left the evidence room of the Supreme Court in Massachusetts. By now Titicut Follies in all his uncut and reputedly infamous glory inevitably is offered on DVDwebsites that usually just sell nauseating horror and perverted sleaze films and the events of this documentary seriously don't belong in this entertainment section. The essence and importance of Titicut Follies is actually more reminiscent to the status of Nazipropaganda films. They're reflections of the black pages in our social history but by now they're just here to remind us never to go down that road again. No rating from me because it feels too much like you're judging the reallife misery of defenseless people on a pathetic scale of 1 to 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1967 documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman made his first and most controversial film that uncovered the truth of what goes on behind the close doors of a seemingly typical mental asylum. The film is called Titicut Follies and has proved itself to be one of the most controversial and enigmatic films of all time. It focuses on one of the touchiest subjects and makes it so you can't turn away even when you feel you should.Titicut Follies documents life at the Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane. It shows graphic depictions in black and white of the horror and wretched tainting of humanity and the dehumanizing of innocent people that took place at the institution. The patients in the asylum are taunted by guards forced to walk around in the nude because it is cheaper and are abused verbally and physically everywhere they turn.The most chilling aspect is when one man dubbed the paranoid schizophrenic claims that he feels worse now than when he checked into Bridgewater State. This leads to the shocking conclusion that maybe the asylum causes mental illness rather than prevents it. There is also a very haunting scene of forcefeeding a reluctant patient whose food is then contaminated with cigarette ash from the person who is forcing the tube down his nose. The scene provided me with one of the most stunning and stiffening feelings I've ever seen in a film.Shortly after it was completed Wiseman was the target of the Massachusetts government who was threatening to ban the film completely from screenings and Television. The government stated that it was a violation of the patients' lives and profit or publicity shouldn't be made at their expense. Wiseman swears that the government was trying to protect a state run institution and because of the graphic nature and honesty of the documentary the people simply didn't want to give one of their facilities a bad name. I truly believe him. It seems like the typical move for a state government. Hide the truth protect the wealthy.Being that the film is so rare how did I stumble upon a copy? Titicut Follies had one and only Television run in 1992 on PBS. The film is available on DVD but is so rare and expensive coming across a copy is harder than it may seem. My uncle of all people had a copy of the one time it was broadcast on TV. A title card with a strict and emotionless narration about the film's content and an introduction by Charlie Rose preceded the film itself. After the film a tongueincheek statement about the asylum changing its ways was shown immediately followed by a PBS representative asking the viewer to call the number on screen to donate ten dollars to help the network invest in more documentaries.So what was the film doing for thirtytwo years? Wiseman continued to direct many other documentaries after Titicut Follies where he focused on a variety of subject matters at the same time try and give his first effort the rightful release it deserved. Finally in 1991 he did after a Supreme Court ruled it acceptable since many of the patients filmed were deceased their legal guardians at the time of the film were notified and each one confirmed to the use of the patient in the documentary and as long as a statement was made that the institution was gradually different.But is it? Currently what happens behind those Bridgewater doors stays behind those Bridgewater doors. It's an undiscovered mystery. I have a feeling it does possess some essence of normality in the present day. In the sixties if you were criminally insane you were treated with carelessness. Over the years I believe people have grew more accepting and tolerate of the unfortunate soles who are simply not all there. I'm sure now in asylums people are much more patient and understanding with the conditions and trying to help.That's not to say a sheet should be placed over past events. The treatment is nonetheless horrifying to this day and Titicut Follies is for the people seeking the harsh truth. While it will be neglected by people that don't believe they can handle the subject matter it truly should be viewed by everyone. It's already sad that the film has had such trouble getting some sort of broad release. This is the kind of film some people need to be forced to watch. Anyone in the medical field should be obligated and any ordinary human should be aware at the very least.Directed by Frederick Wiseman.".

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary was shot without the knowledge of the senior staff and management of the facility making the shooting sometimes rather difficult. What is often lost on the modern viewer is the attitude toward the criminally insane and the mentally disturbed at the time. In the 1960s not many people outside of the psychiatric world knew much of anything about disorders like schizophrenia and sociopathy and this film gave an insight into the daily patterns of people with these disorders.Also this film opened some eyes about the treatment of prisoners and of mental patients at the time. There is significant instances of abuse and neglect including as stated in the other review an unsanitary force feeding of a patient who would not eat. It also shows electroshock convulsive therapy basically putting two electric leads on either temple and sending a shot of electricity through the brain. There is significant nudity and maltreatment by the guards but there are two things not readily apparent in any of the reviews or promos. First this is a prison and all prisoners had to experience some form of nude inspection. Second this is also a population of mentally disturbed who may use the clothing to harm themselves or others.As an aside there are some seriously disturbing scenes including some involving bodily functions. If you have a strong stomach and heart and you are interested in a reflection of this aspect of society in the 1960s this documentary is a solid view. There is no soundtrack and rather than making it seem more distant I feel it allows you to feel like you are there able to interpret your own feelings rather than have them influenced by the choice of music of the director  producer. This isn't a film for entertainment it is educational.".

The scene with the man who didn't clean his room is the only cruel part of the movie.

They didn't offer much of a commentary other than it was a documentary about a psychiatric hospital in Massachusetts. More specifically it is a 1966 film about the realities of a state institution for criminally insane. Haunting cinematography in black and white no overlapping commentary as the images are powerful enough in themselves. It is deeply unsettling to see the overlapping delusional universes  the patients' and the staff's views of the world each one right in their own eyes and at the same time utterly unable to see the reality through the eyes of the other. Also it is unnerving to see how the professionals end up harming those they genuinely want to help. Schizophrenia is projected into the very system that is supposed to break it. The movie clearly demonstrates the system's fundamental flaw which is its attempt to cure splitting by further splitting it away from the world. And that may be the very reason for each instead of mending those who suffer the system not only perpetuates sufferance but ends up broken itself.".

Its all depicted in a mental institution and follows briefly the lives of some of the inmates. Most if not all i suppose are criminally insane.The guards act often very rude and demeaning to the inmates and if this were a stylized Hollywood version would be good villains to carry around sticks. There's no violence however just lots of taunting and name calling.I don't especially recommend this movie as it tends to drag on and on and on. Very monotonous in other words. There's scenes where the guards just wont let up on their hassling of an inmate that eventually makes you want to throw a book at the computer. Perhaps thats the intention.Sure it's banned and that sparks curiosity in all it's forms. I recommend you find a way to view this movie for free where you can skip around and fast forward through the drag of it. Not worth it being released for general rent. I can't say I'd pay anything to see it.".

	schema:headline " Unbelievable reportage of a staggering visual and conceptual power";
	schema:reviewBody "Titicut Follies is a documentary of social denunciation characterised by an unheardof conceptual power documenting the condition suffered by the patients of the criminal asylum Massachusetts Correctional intitution complex of buildings located in Titicut Street in Bridgewater. Here the patients are treated and kept in inhuman conditions they live in small cells with insufficient hygienic conditions in the cramped common rooms in the grip of their delusions originated from their mental pathologies.

There is less slapstick and more plot than usual for a Chan movie less emphasis on comedy and more on action.

	schema:reviewBody "After reading many reviews and most of the comments on IMDb.com I must say that some people don't have a clue what they are talking about. I mean if you give a review of a Jackie Chan movie you don't have to talk about the plot even if it is a good one. Because most of the Jackie Chan movies are not about a plot there is no message from Jackie for you to think about. At least this concerns the films he made before he was indoctrinated by motherland China. He is about the action martial arts and dangerous stunts. The bigger the better. In short mind blowing spectacle. He tries to show you different skills and stunts in each movie he makes and he has been managing to do this for a very long time. Naturally old age has caught up with him. Although it has to be said that old Jackie can do more than any average person on this planet. So despite what you think of his political views he does deserve some credit. It is a real joy to watch him in action and furthermore he wants you to be entertained. So if you are giving a review of a Jackie Chan movie than talk about the action. Especially since this is where Police Story really shines at. This film contains the most memorable fighting scenes made by Jackie in his entire career. And that is saying something. In my opinion it is even better than Police Story 1 since it doesn't allow itself to be distracted by infantile comedy as much as in the first. But don't worry if you love the good old slapstick comedic bits. There are still plenty around. Even after so many years the action is amazing. It holds up like it has been made yesterday. It is far superior to his work in Hollywood Rush Hour Shanghai Noon! I have been a fan of Jackie Chan fan since I can say Jackie Chan and I can be very critical about his work especially his American movies. But Police Story 2 is an action movie that deserves praise simply because it his one of his best a real classic!".

	schema:reviewBody "NEW POLICE STORY II packs a violent confrontation between Jackie and an evil bunch . This stirring story about the cop named Chan Ka Kui of the Hong Kong precinct is well played by Jackie Chan. Chan KaKui or Kevin Chanaka Jackie is a HongKong cop who scores his first big hit by virtually singlehandedly apprehending and arresting a big drug lord in Police story I  . In spite his success at capturing delinquents  Kevin Chan's unorthodox approach to his work as a police officer sees him removed to the traffic branch . While the crime boss recently out from prison is harassing Kevin and his sweetheart . He then plans to take a journey to Bali with his girlfriend named May Maggie Cheung  but while he's at a travel agency in a shopping mall some police agents see him and report that the mall is under a bomb threat . Unable to resist the urge to get involved in officers work Ka Kui orders the policemen to sound the fire alarm and have the mall cleared and agrees to take responsibility for the decision . After that  the police staff Supt. Li played by Kwok Lam is contemplating reinstating Kevin to help them catch a group of bombers trying to extort from building owners . Then Chan looks for vengeance against the ominous villains at a cat and mouse game.This exciting movie is packed with intrigue thrills  unstopped action  suspense  overwhelming stuntwork and lots of violence but with humor . Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous criminals and as always he makes his own stunts like is showed on the final fakeshots . Awesome  incredible stunts and brief comic touches  as usual  the picture is better constructed than Chan's predecessors films . The lightingpaced storyline slows down at times  but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include a stirring car pursuit  Jackie jumping over a bus impressive and interminable fights with Chan dangling and downing  a mall blowup and a breathtaking final explosion and other extraordinary action sequences in James Bond style . This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences  and contains agreeable sense of humor such as previous entries . In this outing Jackie teams up again to prestigious actress and fine action star in their own right  like Maggie Cheung . This is a passable action movie distinguished by ferocious sequences  and packs silly sense of humor as well as Jackie's subsequent entries . Furthermore  moving and thrilling original musical score fitting to action by J Peter Robinson . The picture achieved success in USA and around the world . However  Jackie Chan's failed at Boxoffice in his American debut Battle creek brawl . Chan is a hardworking actor and director throughout his long and varied career .He went on playing Cannoball  The protector and Rumble in the Bronx until getting all American success with Shangai Knights  The tuxedo  Around the world in 8days and Rush hour trilogy  and of the course the recent Karate kid. Of course  his big hits were The Police story series that won the Golden Horse Award a Chinese version of the Oscar  the first was titled Police story1985 directed by the same Chan  it was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre  the following was Police story 21988also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches. It's followed by Supercop or Police story 3 and finally Police story IV  Crime story. The picture is lavishly produced by the great Asian producers Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest production and compellingly directed by Jackie Chan . Rating  Acceptable and passable  the picture has its sensational moments here and there  but also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches mostly provided by its agile star  the super Jackie . It's a perfect action film for enthusiast of the genre .".

I love Chan's early work and the Police Story features which did come across as epic crime joints are some of his best latter stuff. As for Police Story Part 2 it continues on from the excellent original to simply match the quality and go on to be a little larger in scale and excitingly explosive literally.The Hong Kong police force doesn't like individual heroes and that's what they see Ka Kui as. His effective but it always comes at a cost which they are not willing to take. So for he extreme acts Kui is demoted to a traffic cop. However after some threats on his life and his girlfriend which causes more of a stir he decides to quit for his wellbeing and that of his girlfriend. But it doesn't last long when he's conned back onto the force to help combat against a string of bomb threats involving a gang holding ransom a big corporation.Jackie Chan flexibly directs astonishingly dangerous stuntsgalore and inventively rapid if elaborate martial arts choreography in what is an oldhat but very busy and comic book pulp cops and robbers chase formula. It's customary investigation work by trying to predict the next move and virtually racing against the clock to stop the bad guys which has two lots for Chan to take on. The tough action is instinctive uncanny and lethal making it amazing to watch with an upbeat music tempo underlining it and boy their's a destructive mess after nearly every ordeal. This goes for the electrifying and impulsive climatic showdown. Like most of these outings it doesn't forget the humour which is quite broad and silly but these comic elements can be fun and actually it's rather toned down than usual. It's moreso serious involving the pressure and dangers of the job with a multifacet performance by Chan as there's an unhealthy obsession boldly dogged but selfcentred making his character truly blind of what really should be important to him. However I found to get in the way was the love interest angle the factor of police work getting in the way of love which was important for certain story developments and to squeeze out suspenseful situations but still those awkward moments do slow down its momentum.

	schema:reviewBody "There is one detail which is not very common for Jackie Chan movies but which is present here. It has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too. Jackie is menacing and psychotic here. He is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back in a usual laidback pattern but he is the one who can go and start the tumult. His manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing every time it goes crack!. Another highlight is the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend. It's one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen. Besides the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall it also looks like a poster of rabochiy from the Soviet era and some lines in Russian on the left. That looks terrific and nostalgic for Russian people. I also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies. Here there's a lot of this stuff. It's quite amazing watching the characters fallingjumpingrunningdriving through all manner of panes.All three movies are great. There is no downslide in the quality  it's a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts and not only Jackie Chan's character appears in all three movies  that's also excellent and keeps continuity up.Each movie can be described in a few words No.1  great in all aspects  it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end and funny many scenes are ridiculous No.2  raging Jackie is really off the hook here and painful Jackie gets tortured No.3  unbelievable the woman that fights alongside with Jackie is incredible and bombastic should a lot of guns and explosions be mentioned?.As to the rest  much has been mentioned by the others.It's a trilogy that can be watched over and over again at least by me. Its place is in top 10 among action jewels.A solid 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a real shame that 1988's Police Story 2 is more of the same from starwriterdirector Jackie Chan because it could have been even greater than the classic Police Story 1985. The greatest of what Police Story 2 suffers from is an uneven story and lack of trademark Chan fight scenes and stunts. Police Story 2 has Hong Kong police detective Chan Ka Kui Chan busted down to patrolman because of the mall brawl fiasco in the first film. For those expecting an allout stuntfest like Police Story this first sequel in the series will be a disappointment. Although more characterstorydriven which is a plus for Chan and martial arts movies in general those who came to see stunts and hardhitting slaphappy handtohand combat action will be the ones feeling leftout or cheated. Now as a patrolman Ka Kui finds himself at the mercy of girlfriend May Maggie Cheung and his superiors who are trying to keep him out of trouble. However because Ka Kui is a Hong Kong supercop in need of some action the aforementioned trouble comes in the form of the gangster he locked up in the first film in addition to more bloodthirsty criminals and a deaf gonzo highkicking toymaker Benny Lai who has an aptitude for rigging RC vehicles with things that go BOOM. Like its predecessor Police Story 2 does have Chan battling criminals like any movie cop but with a kungfu vengeance. The actionfight sequences are few and far between intermingled with comedic or dramatic scenes of Chan and company sorting through bureaucracy and political redtape as they try to nab the bad guys and many of these comedic or dramatic scenes seem to run on as you await the action. Perhaps it's a change for most martial arts movies but an unneeded change for those accustomed to Chan's usual work. Albeit an entertaining and a conflicted and uneven tale when it does come to action Chan doesn't disappoint. There are two early fights with hired goons one in a restaurant and another in the park and then there is also a truck chase that climaxes with Ka Kui diving into a window. Then there's the ending confrontation between Ka Kui and the criminals with a deadly kungfu brawl between him and the Toymaker who has some pretty lethal moves of his own and proves to be Chan's most skilled opponent. It all ends with a huge display of fireworks.810".

	schema:headline " Not enough fun action to save the horrendous plot.";
	schema:reviewBody " out of As the direct sequel to Jackie Chan's highly enjoyable Police Story I had high expectations for this thriller but those expectations were only occasionally met making this an inconsistent action outing that's easily the weakest of the Police Story series.Jackie Chan returns as well the cop with multiple names depending on which version you see he's Kevin Chan KaKui or Jackie.  Anyway after the incidents of the previous film Jackie's been demoted to traffic cop and constantly receives death threats from crime lord Chu Tao whom he busted in the first movie but is on parole because of a lifethreatening illness. Jackie's still got his faithful and loving girlfriend May Maggie Cheung but when she's threatened by Tao's thugs Jackie replies back with his fists and feet.  Eventually to keep May safe he quits the police force but is brought back when bomb threats are delivered to a lucrative corporation. Unsurprisingly May will get involved and it'll be up to Jackie to save the day.  Jackie Chan movies have always been driven by action so to expect anything different from Police Story II would be foolish.  But I at least expect a watchable plot that keeps the film flowing nicely inbetween the martial arts battles.  Not so here not only is the plot terrible the film also has less action than most of Chan's superior outings.  Bringing back the main villain from the original was a good idea but the filmmakers use that as more of a red herring and a reason to set up fight scenes than for any purpose relating to plot. It's not until about halfway through the film we realize Chu Tao has virtually nothing to do with the story he's just filler until we're introduced to and stuck with a small group of terrorist bombers who are some of the lamest Jackie Chan villains to date.To give you an idea of how lame one of the villains is an annoying deafmute whom everybody dubs Dumb.  I could barely tell the other three apart bland and dull as they were.  The movie sets up two of these villains with high skills in martial arts but they're hardly given a chance to strut their stuff in their fight scenes with Chan which spend more time doing creative things with sets and props than actually trying to get the adrenaline pumping with an allout kungfu battle.Stupidity is something this movie has in spades.  Most of the cops in the film don't even know how to follow procedure or for that matter launch a thorough investigation.  Chan's the one doing most of the problemsolving everyone else takes a backseat.  Chan directed the film so I have no idea if this speaks more upon his ego or just how lazily written the script is. I'm not even sure which is worse.The film's opening fight set inside a restaurant is quite impressive and at least then I still didn't no just how dumb the story would be.  A later fight set in a playground feels superfluous and by then we realize it holds no impact towards the plot.  We're just watching people beat on each other with metal rods for the sake of padding the running time.  But for what it is the action choreography is still excellent especially the abandoned warehouse finale which boasts a very nimble Chan hopping around from floor to floor with an almost effortless grace.Also keeping the film relatively watchable is Maggie Cheung who really has terrific chemistry with Chan.  Without her presence this movie would be quite a stinker but she's thankfully given plenty of screen time and even gets a hilarious tirade inside the men's shower room of a police station. Cheung is one of Hong Kong's most talented actresses with a seemingly effortless ability to jump back and forth between performing slapstick stunts and humor as she does here and delivering powerful dramatic performances as she did in the wonderful Hero her best film to datePolice Story II is further weakened by a teethscratching score and a poor use of sound the punches and kicks sound more like a guy beating a twobyfour against a rug amplified by a broken microphone but I guess that's to be expected from an 80's chop suey flick.  It's not a movie I recommend but there's no doubt seeing Jackie Chan in action is a joy to behold.".

A later fight set in a playground feels superfluous and by then we realize it holds no impact towards the plot.  We're just watching people beat on each other with metal rods for the sake of padding the running time.  But for what it is the action choreography is still excellent especially the abandoned warehouse finale which boasts a very nimble Chan hopping around from floor to floor with an almost effortless grace.Also keeping the film relatively watchable is Maggie Cheung who really has terrific chemistry with Chan.  Without her presence this movie would be quite a stinker but she's thankfully given plenty of screen time and even gets a hilarious tirade inside the men's shower room of a police station. Cheung is one of Hong Kong's most talented actresses with a seemingly effortless ability to jump back and forth between performing slapstick stunts and humor as she does here and delivering powerful dramatic performances as she did in the wonderful Hero her best film to datePolice Story II is further weakened by a teethscratching score and a poor use of sound the punches and kicks sound more like a guy beating a twobyfour against a rug amplified by a broken microphone but I guess that's to be expected from an 80's chop suey flick.  It's not a movie I recommend but there's no doubt seeing Jackie Chan in action is a joy to behold.";

In this film a group of deranged bombers targets a large corporation for ransom or else the bombers will commit act of terror on populated buildings they own. Chan however has been relegated to traffic cop after his expensive and dangerous antics from the last film. He also has to contend with thugs hired by a drugkingpin he has thrown in jail. To complicate manners he has a falling out with his charming girlfriend. How can he solve all of these problems?? This film is a bit of a let down after the incredible first instalment in the series. The action in Police Story 2 feels much less real and gritty than the first film. Action scenes even feel like they have punches and kicks sped up in post processing. The film also overemphasizes the goofy comedy that the first film had. Although still charming at times it feels forced in this instalment. For example one character always has his glasses broken. Very high brow comedy right? Chan's girlfriend May played by Maggie Cheung once again has a falling out with Chan over his overzealousness at work. Again this plot line feels as forced as some of the humour in the film however it does lead to a few touching scenes as May and Chan grapple with their feelings as the terrorist threat heats up.Was this a great film? No not really. It suffers from forced humour and drama and some quite incomprehensible issues like WaWa man for example. Some of the action feels artificial as well which for me is the biggest let down. Even so the film is fun and the action is often quite good. Although there is no jumping from the top floor of a mall and sliding down Christmas lights scene like in the first film there are some great falls fights and stunts that are worth watching. Jackie Chan is charismatic funny and frighteningly loose with his stunts which is he is so great on screen. All in all a fun but flawed increment in the Police Story series of films.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a little surprised at the positive reaction to the Police Story franchise. Maybe its because I'm new to the Hong KongMartial Arts genre but then again there was something morbidly fascinating about the first Police Story that made me jump right into the sequel. The worst part of the first film was the completely misplaced comedy and they almost completely eliminated that from the second. It still has a few comedic points but its far more appropriate to the tone of the movie and no fullon comedy gags like the first one. The plot is far more serious the action toned down a little but still just seems to be more of what you'd expect from an action film called Police Story. It has villains thugs undercover operations and hand to hand combat of course. The pace of this film is significantly slower and seems to really drag in the middle of the film. As much as I always like to see villains return from previous films I'm not sure it was necessary to this story. We already have a major villain in the bomber and then we have the return villain from the last film and the story line with May and the bombers. There is a lot for one film.Jackie Chan returns as star and director once again. He certainly sets the right tone for the film using the backdrop of Hong Kong. The film is more of a thriller than an action film because the action scenes are even more dispersed than they were in the first film. There is a very impressive explosion midfilm but the rest of the explosions seem cheap and campy. Chan doesn't showcase his usual array of skills with the exception of a few scenes. Maggie Cheung returns as Chan's girlfriend May and gets a much bigger role this time around. She is decent and they have good chemistry so she definitely works in the role well. KwokHung Lam and Bill Tung also return as Chan's superiors. Fortunately they are more sparingly used so they don't seem as ridiculous as they did in the first film. There is not really a main villain to focus attention on. The bombers sort of all act as one entity but they do a decent job. John Cheung and Charlie Cho both return from the first film as subvillains to the story.Similar to the first movie the best action scenes are at the beginning and the end of the film and as stated the middle lumbers along at a slow pace but its still fun to watch and something about this series so far really grows on you. I'm interested to see if it takes a turn further into the series especially once Chan stops directing. Its still amazing to think how these films are made with actors doing their own insane stunts and how badly they often hurt themselves Chan included as shown in the closing credits. If nothing else that is what makes these films so unique and fun to watch is knowing they literally put themselves through hell to bring entertainment to us. 6.510".

The worst part of the first film was the completely misplaced comedy and they almost completely eliminated that from the second. It still has a few comedic points but its far more appropriate to the tone of the movie and no fullon comedy gags like the first one. The plot is far more serious the action toned down a little but still just seems to be more of what you'd expect from an action film called Police Story. It has villains thugs undercover operations and hand to hand combat of course. The pace of this film is significantly slower and seems to really drag in the middle of the film. As much as I always like to see villains return from previous films I'm not sure it was necessary to this story. We already have a major villain in the bomber and then we have the return villain from the last film and the story line with May and the bombers. There is a lot for one film.Jackie Chan returns as star and director once again. He certainly sets the right tone for the film using the backdrop of Hong Kong. The film is more of a thriller than an action film because the action scenes are even more dispersed than they were in the first film. There is a very impressive explosion midfilm but the rest of the explosions seem cheap and campy. Chan doesn't showcase his usual array of skills with the exception of a few scenes. Maggie Cheung returns as Chan's girlfriend May and gets a much bigger role this time around. She is decent and they have good chemistry so she definitely works in the role well. KwokHung Lam and Bill Tung also return as Chan's superiors. Fortunately they are more sparingly used so they don't seem as ridiculous as they did in the first film. There is not really a main villain to focus attention on. The bombers sort of all act as one entity but they do a decent job. John Cheung and Charlie Cho both return from the first film as subvillains to the story.Similar to the first movie the best action scenes are at the beginning and the end of the film and as stated the middle lumbers along at a slow pace but its still fun to watch and something about this series so far really grows on you. I'm interested to see if it takes a turn further into the series especially once Chan stops directing. Its still amazing to think how these films are made with actors doing their own insane stunts and how badly they often hurt themselves Chan included as shown in the closing credits. If nothing else that is what makes these films so unique and fun to watch is knowing they literally put themselves through hell to bring entertainment to us. 6.510";

To me that says little unless you said that it is the one where the warehouse blows up at the end then I would know what movie was being referred to.After the events in Police Story Jackie is demoted to traffic cop and the guy that he busted is now out of gaol. The guy is tormenting Jackie so he beats him up in a restaurant and decides to retire but before he leaves for Bali he saves a whole heap of people in a shopping mall when they receive a bomb threat. So he is reinstated and must go after these bunch of people who like blowing things up.This is quite a humorous movie and poor May the girlfriend seems to land up in no end of trouble. She is sent to Bali without a passport drives into a parked car and is harassed by gangsters and terrorists. Being the girlfriend of a famous cop is probably not a good idea because they will pick on you to get to him but that is what May is there for.This is a great little movie and very funny. I actually think that it is far superior to the original Police Story which I found to be interesting but not exciting. But still since it is a Jackie Chan movie it is good.".

Peter Stirling Donald O'Connor is recalled to active Army duty but when the hapless lieutenant is assigned to a Women's Army Corps WAC detachment due to a flawed clerical procedure in the Pentagon neither he nor his new distaff officer companions are pleased with a nonsensical situation. His WAC superiors believe that Peter has been planted as a scout and is being used to undermine their efforts opposing a men's army unit in an upcoming War Games matchup and Peter and Francis invent a method to persuade the women that he is not there for clandestine purposes. The quaint pair is capable of attempting this because Peter's proxy specialty is training women soldiers to become camouflage experts and since the Games are going to be focused upon just such activity the situation is readied for crucial events. The film was completed in Spring of 1954 shot primarily at California's Fort Ord with numerous WACS assigned there being employed as extras in a film that pleasingly reflects the result of highquality production values contributed by the Universal management. Arthur Lubin director of all six of the O'Connor featured Francis films offers sluggish pacing with this item largely due to an overly complicated scenario that weighs down the final section dealing with camouflage competition between the military men and women. As with all Francis pictures a primary interest in this one relates to early performances of wellknown actors including the initial yelps of fear from Scream Queen Allison Hayes and Universal ingnues Mamie Van Doren and Julia Adams although the best playing is by veteran ZaSu Pitts as an undone Army nurse clever thematic scoring by Irving Gertz was used years later by the Studio for other releases.".

	schema:headline " With sad round of drifters Tchin finds himself";
	schema:reviewBody "This may be Tchin's first distinctively personal work. 'Htel des Amriques' is a rueful disconcerting film whose central theme is the doomed relationship of two people both distracted and hopeless who aren't right for each other and don't know where they're going. Not altogether surprisingly they meet as the result of a car crash in which one almost runs over the other. That's a good sign of where things are headed.All this happens in Biarritz city of tourists and gamblers a place one character says is not quite France but not quite anywhere else. It's another character in the film alienating yet still romantic and of course a place where one might win big. At least it's a good place for a hotel. But the irony of the hotel is that when its owner returns from making a lot of money in Mexico he modernizes it and it becomes soulless and the cozy voluptuous French petits djeuners with strong coffee crisp bread and big pats of butter are replaced by packaged American breakfasts deemed trendy and appealing to foreign guests.Gilles Patrick Delawaere excellent and troubling here is an engaging but disastrous loser poetic but seedy who's mistakenly devoted to a pseudoartistic petty criminal named Bernard Etienne Chicot whom he met when both were sojourning in New York. Bernard is really a very unpleasant man a liar and wouldbe serial seducer who pretends his songwriting is important he can't even make money as a street musician. Both men live in the hotel of Gilles' mother who runs the place along with his younger sister a heavy reader who never goes out but is madly in love with a man who once stayed one night at the hotel.The woman who almost kills Gilles with her car at the outset of the film is Hlne Catherine Deneuve an anesthesiologist adrift after the death of an older man an architect whom she loved and who left her a large decrepit villa he had planned to restore in which they were already living. She has moved now to a studio apartment with an ocean view when she hits Gilles and he latches onto her and won't let go. She's so lonely she accepts him but she can't really love him and it would be impractical to do so.

In 'Wild Reeds''Les roseaux sauvages' another of Tchin's best films the composition is simple just a girl and two boys one of whom is gay and the other bisexual.Also emerging in this film is the gay element that's everpresent in the director's best work usually with gay people and straight people who are friends and someone bisexual who links them all physically like the bi Vice Squad chief played by Sami Bouajila in 'The Witnesses''Les Tmoins' who's madly in love and in lust with Manu Johan Libreau the boy who dies a tragic early AIDS victim but who also loves his beautiful wife Emmanuelle Bart the frustrated children's book author who is to write their saga as a novel with Manu's true confessions at its center.Obviously linking seemingly disconnected people through variable sexualities is essential to Tchin's way of composing a film. In 'Htel des Amriques' the dilemma isn't as clear as in 'Wild Reeds.' Bernard may be bisexual and Gilles may be in love with him as well as Hlne. Certainly he's torn between them and Bertrand's heterosexual boasting may be a pose. The gay post office worker Luc JeanLouis Vitrac is attracted to Bernard. Bernard rejects Luc but falls back upon him in desperation when his life is a shambles. Jacques Nolot the filmmaker plays a tough gay leatherman who tries to beat up Bernard in a cruising area. This was Nolot's first film role and he runs the whorehouse hotel occupied by Manu and his sister in 'Les Tnoins.' Meanwile he has become highly respected latterly for his own few wry boldly unguarded autobiographical films. He wrote the scenario for Tchin's 'I Don't Kiss' 1991 whch contains autobiographical elements for both him and the director.'Htel des Amriques' was a turning point for Tchin. He has said that from then on he no longer made genre films and this was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration with Deneuve six films together so far 2009. With a gay sensibility Tchin has worked with the most beautiful actresses in French cinema including Emmanuelle Bart and Juliette Binoche. This 1981 Deneuve is icy cold as she tended to be when young but later she uses her iciness to be engagingly annoying for Arnaud Desplechin in Kings and Queen and A Christmas Tale showing these two auteurs don't find her perfection at all offputting and rightly so icequeen Deneuve has blossomed into a woman who has depths and can be humorous and almost cuddly.The thing is that whether you like 'Htel des Amriques' or not and I find it unsatisfying you can see in it how Tchin came to find himself through working not from genres or from movies but from life and in particular from the quirks of his characters and their interactions. This explains his reliance on l'imprvu the element of the unforeseen the improvised with accidents and pickups in bars or cruising areas determining story arcs and relationships.".

	onyx:emotionText "This may be Tchin's first distinctively personal work. 'Htel des Amriques' is a rueful disconcerting film whose central theme is the doomed relationship of two people both distracted and hopeless who aren't right for each other and don't know where they're going. Not altogether surprisingly they meet as the result of a car crash in which one almost runs over the other. That's a good sign of where things are headed.All this happens in Biarritz city of tourists and gamblers a place one character says is not quite France but not quite anywhere else. It's another character in the film alienating yet still romantic and of course a place where one might win big. At least it's a good place for a hotel. But the irony of the hotel is that when its owner returns from making a lot of money in Mexico he modernizes it and it becomes soulless and the cozy voluptuous French petits djeuners with strong coffee crisp bread and big pats of butter are replaced by packaged American breakfasts deemed trendy and appealing to foreign guests.Gilles Patrick Delawaere excellent and troubling here is an engaging but disastrous loser poetic but seedy who's mistakenly devoted to a pseudoartistic petty criminal named Bernard Etienne Chicot whom he met when both were sojourning in New York. Bernard is really a very unpleasant man a liar and wouldbe serial seducer who pretends his songwriting is important he can't even make money as a street musician. Both men live in the hotel of Gilles' mother who runs the place along with his younger sister a heavy reader who never goes out but is madly in love with a man who once stayed one night at the hotel.The woman who almost kills Gilles with her car at the outset of the film is Hlne Catherine Deneuve an anesthesiologist adrift after the death of an older man an architect whom she loved and who left her a large decrepit villa he had planned to restore in which they were already living. She has moved now to a studio apartment with an ocean view when she hits Gilles and he latches onto her and won't let go. She's so lonely she accepts him but she can't really love him and it would be impractical to do so. The circle is completed by Rudel Franois Perrot a doctor Hlne knew in medical school who once was her lover he's a compulsive gambler whom Hlne appeals to for some sort of stability. He turns out to be the one Gilles' sister fell in love with.This is one of Tchin's odd assortments of interconnected people you can see the same thing going on in his 2007 'The Witnesses.'

	schema:reviewBody "Wow did I have a bad night. I usually love French films and was excited to watch a DVD with two of Catherine Deneuve's films Le Sauvage and Htel des Amriques. Amazingly both of the films were among the least interesting films I have seen in some timemostly because of the terrible writing. This is sad because one of the big reasons I usually prefer French films to recent Hollywood films is the writing but in these two films they simply created characters that were hard to care about or understand.Deneuve plays Hlne a lady who obviously is in mourning for a dead lover. She can't get on with her life. However when she meets Gilles Patrick Dewaere they become loverseven though there really is absolutely no chemistry between them...none! As for Gilles he seems very moody and is good friends with a guy who loves to steal and beat up gay people. Now this could have been interesting as this gay protest could have been an indication that Gilles and his male friend were lovers or harbored sexual feelings for each other. This may have turned off some viewers but it really would have seemed plausible and interesting. Instead however you just assume that since Gilles likes such an evil man that he too is a jerk. And through the course of the film he does nothing to change that opinion. In fact as the film progresses he gets moodier and moodieruntil you are ready to shout at the screen for him to get over it and stop sulking and be a man!Deneuve's character is rather interesting at first. The idea of her having all this emotional baggage and being constricted when it came to love was interesting. However she is so distant and so moody that you wonder why Gilles puts up with her. Sure he's pretty but this is the only thing he could see in her. Heck their sex lives weren't even good...so why does he stay? And why doesn't she either grow or simply reject him completely because she refuses to give in to love? Instead she and the audience are stuck in limbo. While the movie is only 93 minutes long it seems like a lifetime as these two just exist and the relationship is stuck in neutraland there is absolutely no coherent reason for them to be together in the first place or remain together.Overall impossible to believe and dull. I can think of many many films Ms. Deneuve made that are better...and none off the top of my head that were worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tagline A starstunned cast spoiled by a mediocre script Review by Neo Imagine the 5 biggest TVB actors at the time starring in a movie together and within the five there are little names like Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai. So what can possibly go wrong maybe it is due to the all too ordinary direction from veteran actor Eric Tsang or perhaps we can just blame it on the routine and blend script. The film is basically trying to say that one wrong act will lead to another one and eventually to the point of no return. A bleak and dark look into police corruption director Tsang fails to make use of his 5 tigers Andy Lau TakWah Tony Leung ChiuWai Felix Wong YatWah Miu KiuWai Ken Tong ChunYip and the result is a brutally average flick that never rises above its genre convention. While it is okay to be efficient there are moments that the audience actually feels bored and it doesn't help when the running time is clocked at just a little under 2 hours. Perhaps 30 minutes too long The Tigers is ultimately a missed opportunity and a waste of once in a life time chance to see all 5 tigers in action.It is almost amazing to witness the annoying performance of two superstars of Asian Cinema. The unbelievable have happened Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Andy Lau are just plain annoying. Luckily Leung manages to impresses in the scenes prior to his death in the car park and Lau manages to pick his act together and actually attempt to act upon the death of Leung. The second half provides an Andy Lau that shows glimpses of the actor Lau is right now.As for the evil tiger Ken Tong ChunYip he never seems to be able to create anymore than a pretty much onedimensional villain. Current TVB star Miu KiuWai is dead pan wooden and Felix Wong YatWah is just his typical angry filled face throughout. Shaw Brothers favourite Leung Kar Yan is the unlikely person to shine above the aforementioned tigers and his character is sympathetic enough for the audience to care about.All in all the star power of the 5 tigers is alone worthy for the price of the movie and while the movie is really like the case of an unfulfilling romance it isn't exactly total downhill. There is no doubt that the script have let the 5 former and present TVB superstars down and for some of them luckily have gone on to better things. At the end of the day The Tigers struggles to be average and all they are trying to say is that one mistake leads to another and eventually to the point of no return. Life as a corrupt cop sucks in The Tigers and so are the awaiting audience hoping for something better. With that being said the film did gives the audience some answers to their questions Tony Leung Chiu Wai can actually be annoying Andy Lau showing glimpses of his future and Eric Tsang is a far better producer than director. Finishing off The Tigers is really a movie that tries to be average and comes up falling short Neo 2008 I rate it 5.7510www.thehkneo.com".

I guess that is what happens when rich men in suits get more and more greedy to the extent that they put the entire enterprise in danger because all they want is profit profit profit. And who will be the ones that suffer from it? Everybody apart from the rich guys basically. On the one hand it would be the people who want to fly to their destinations and who get in all kinds of trouble because their flights get canceled. On the other hand it would be the employees of the company namely the stewards and stewardesses who will be the first ones to lose their jobs. The movie tried to turn it into a mix of drama and documentary and one of the drama aspects one that is not too based on facts is the fate of a stewardess of the airplane and how the company's demise affects her family life. Director Michael Steiner is responsible for some of Switzerland's most famous films from the last 10 years including Sennentuntschi. However I have to say that I did not find a single one of his works particularly memorable. admittedly I did not see his entire body of work. Grounding is not a really bad film by any means but something was missing to make it truly worth watching. Also I found it way too long. 90 minutes would really have been fine and there were a lot totally forgettable scenes that could have been cut. Instead this film easily crosses the 2hourmark. Not recommended.".

In order to end my experiment at the stock exchange I even had to donate the shares to the broker firm because Swissair was in bankruptcy and I could not sell them for US 30.Well this summarizes how I approached this film. The powerpoint slides shown by the consultant were telltale and neatly summarized how Swissair got into that mess. The negotiations with the banks were also a perverse fun to watch big banks wanting to crash Swissair in order to cheaply buy the stillprofitable remnants of the wreck.As somebody grown up and living in Switzerland I did not like that the film was made in the SwissGerman dialect. You know all the regional dialects that good that you wonder if the Swissair CEO really spoke like that may you even know him? The new chief financial officer Mario Corti hires from the U.S. Jacqualayn Fouse speaks such a horrible English. It sounded more like a German imitating American English than an American imitating German. They could have used a perfect accentfree German playing her part especially when all the other roles speak SwissGerman dialectthis would have kept the distance between the Swiss managers and her as the hired expert from the U.S.Another big trouble was the trashy kitschy story about the little boy. About her mother. About her husband. It just did not look genuine. And the Italian worker in the GateGourmet kitchen  the police storming the cold room. Really.The movie was certainly a wellmade one. If one forgets everything beside the main plot which was saving the airline and the negotiations with the government and the banks. A wellmade corporate thriller is feasible and will attract many moviegoers. But don't waste the good premise with cheesy subplots please. And I really mean PLEASE.Another positive point worth mentioning is that the chief personnel officer of Swissair Matthias Mlleney actually played himself in this movie.And I want my US 550 back by the way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Under the watchful eye of producer Hal Roach Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy moved from silent shorts in the 1920s to feature length talkies in the 1930s to become one of the world's best loved comedy double acts. At Roach's studios Laurel in particular was given the freedom he needed to refine the duo's act working as writer and producer on a number of films. By the end of the decade with scores of classic shorts and features behind them relations between the double act and Roach were strained beyond breaking point and Laurel and Hardy left the studio  and their glory days  behind them.Great Guns was the first proper film of the postRoach era The Flying Deuces with RKO something of a oneoff. The move to Twentieth Century Fox in 1941 brought down these giants of comedy in four short years assigning them to the B unit where little care was taken and little interest shown in what was being made. Their talent wasted by the talentless men who surrounded them the Laurel and Hardy we loved were dismantled simplified and bastardised.In Great Guns we find them as gardener and chauffeur to a sickly rich kid drafted in spite of being allergic to everything. When the army medical proves there's nothing wrong with him he eagerly jumps into uniform with Stan and Ollie joining him to make sure their master is well looked after.The change in the duo is jarring Fox's fumble immediately noticeable. Here we see not the gentle troublemakers we remember nor the ambitious underachievers content in their delusion that they can better themselves. As gardener and chauffeur they are servile loyal selfsacrificing. They know their place and that there they belong none of Ollie's arrogance here no petty oneupmanship with exasperated authority figures. Gone are the childlike nave little strugglers our charming anarchists replaced by simple idiots. This wasn't just a botched attempt to move them on it was a fundamental misunderstanding of their appeal.This isn't Laurel and Hardy. Look at how Ollie's size is now handled with joke after joke about his waistline we see him compared to a blimp and a weather balloon as people queue up to tell him how fat he is. In their glory days the joke was Ollie's agility in spite of his girth his delicate finger taps and tie waving. Now the joke is his girth. He's fat. We get it. The same subtle treatment is extended to Stan's simplemindedness. He was always in a world of his own but before all we needed was one of Ollie's withering looks to tell us so. Here people just call him an idiot namecalling a poor substitute for punchlines. It makes their act too blatant as if Fox wanted to assure us they understood what the boys were all about.The Flying Deuces showed that the duo could work well enough without Hal Roach but to do so they had to have solid writing and directing with input from Stan Laurel. At Fox they were just actors and actors saddled with poor scripts and no creative control. Simon Louvish's biography tells how Oliver Hardy would sit at home going over the Fox scripts shaking his head in disbelief as his character was betrayed a terribly sad picture to imagine. Beyond its poorly handled characterisation Great Guns just isn't funny with Penelope the crow an obvious example. Consider too the drippy romantic subplot that keeps the boys on the sidelines for scene after scene.We don't care about it. There's no reason to.One of the biggest problems with the boys' wartime output was the war itself. Stan and Ollie don't belong in a world with Nazism. They'd been in the army countless times before but those were more innocent times. Here our heroes were confronted by such a unique evil that they were horribly out of place. They should be struggling with a piano and a flight of stairs or fighting with James Finlayson because he won't buy a Christmas tree. Seeing them in the same world as Pearl Harbor and the holocaust is uncomfortable.Given their reputation it's surprising to learn that the first few Fox pictures were modest successes but it's easy enough to understand. In an age before television repeats reissues and remastering the only chance to see the muchloved duo was in their new films and even a belowpar Laurel and Hardy were better than none at all. Today when a short from the '20s is as available to us as the featurelength dross from the '40s there's less reason to be so charitable. In Great Guns we can see the beginning of the end and that however sad the end was it was inevitable with material of this quality.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1940s were not kind to Laurel and Hardy. First they looked very oldtime had not been very kind to them especially Stan Laurel. Second Ollie now weighed in at about 350 pounds and simply was too rotund to do all the physical humor the duo had done in the 1930s. And finally after SAPS AT SEA 1940 the team unwisely left Hal Roach Studiomaking films for RKO Fox and other studios that seemed to have no idea what to do with them. Overall these movies are dreadfulterribly unfunny and sad for most Laurel and Hardy fans to watch.Perhaps among the best of these poor films was GREAT GUNS. While the film wasn't particularly funny it also was reasonably diverting and at least the team didn't embarrass themselves. However at the onset the film has one major strike against it. Like almost all of these 40s films Stan and Ollie are NOT the whole show so to speak. Instead they are most supporting characterssomething they almost never did in their earlier films. In DANCE MASTERS 1943 Stan and Ollie help out a guy and girl who are in love but whose parents don't approve in NOTHING BUT TROUBLE 1944 they help out young prince and here in GREAT GUNS they follow a guy into the cavalry who supposedly is too sickly to serve. It seems that in the 40s Stan and Ollie now are no longer comedians but social workers of sorts! At the onset you must completely suspend disbelief to watch this film. After all the boys are both about 50 and Ollie must weigh as much as a tank. No army is THAT desperate for men! However despite the improbability of the plot and that the team are more supporting players GREAT GUNS has a few pluses. Stan and Ollie's war film isn't great but compares reasonably well to other contemporary films such as BUCK PRIVATES CAUGHT IN THE DRAFT and MR. WINKLE GOES TO WAR. Also while not superfunny there are a few good moments and I did laugh a few timessomething I NEVER did with many of the other 1940s films they made.Overall if you are not a fan of the team or know little about them don't watch this film. It will not particularly impress you or you might assume it's like their earlier workwhich it isn't. However if like me you are a rabid fan then at least this one won't make you cringe and it's a harmless diversion.".

This time the movie focuses on their mishaps in bootcamp. Laurel  Hardy don't really get to show the best of their qualities in this movie but the provide the movie with a couple of entertaining moments nevertheless. There are a couple of sequences that are still are of comical greatness such as the scene in which the boys ride in a jeep during a combat exercise but like often was the case in their later movies there are more misses than hits with its humor. The movie isn't consistently funny but yet it always remains perfectly entertaining to watch although I would definitely had prefer some more slapstick from the two boys.Reason why this movie still works out quite well is due to its well written story. It makes the movie flow well and also is the reason why this movie is such a perfectly entertaining one. It makes the movie consistent and provides it with some good comical moments and dialog.The lovestory of the movie between the Sheila Ryan and Dick Nelson characters is quite enjoyable and not as distracting as often had been the case in other Laurel  Hardy picturesThe movie is a great looking one with good costumes and sets. It's obvious that they spend quite some money on this movie. The movie ends with quite a big battle sequences that is well fitted into the movie and makes sure that the movie ends with a blast.Might not be so hilarious be very entertaining nevertheless.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Made in some degree to capitalize on the success of the era's other comedy kingpin duo Abbott and Costello this film falls somewhat short of the same year's Buck Privates. That picture showcased patriotism as a cherished ideal and utilized a barrage of elements to keep movie goers clamoring for more not the least of which included the Andrews Sisters performing the classic 'Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy'. By comparison this picture falls measurably flat most likely as suggested by others on this forum that the stars lost considerable creative control by signing on with Fox.Not that the film is a total dud but the charisma that Laurel and Hardy developed earlier in their careers just isn't on display here. As I mentioned in another review Tit For Tat I delight now in seeing how LH did things funny as opposed to doing funny things. The one bit that comes close to passing muster here is the 'raven in the pants' scene but even that one seems a bit overdone and forced without the nuance of the cookie routine in Tit For Tat. As well I kept waiting for one of Stan's brilliant but nonsensical affirmations 'He who filters your good name steals trash' but there just weren't any.Still for fans of the boys there's enough here to recommend at least a single viewing even if they're not at the top of their game. In that respect every great actor and comedy team is entitled to an eventual misstep. The good thing about Laurel and Hardy is that their subpar work often beats the competition anyway.".

	schema:headline " Not ideal Laurel and Hardy but somewhat fun all the same";
	schema:reviewBody "As most Laurel and Hardy enthusiasts know this was the first film that the two comedians made for 20th Century Fox after leaving Hal Roach. Suddenly pressed into an oppressive studio system the stars were put through their paces in a movie that was intentionally meant as a ripoff of Abbott  Costello's Buck Privates. Not having seen that movie I can't comment on the similarities. However I can comment that Stan and Ollie are clearly not in the same type of picture that they had been appearing in previously. Whether that's good or bad depends on your point of view.Stan and Babe had spent twelve years developing a slower more laconic style of comedy dependent upon milking reactions to familiar gags and being more about characters than situations. All that is gone with Great Guns which is more about silly gags and patter. The pace is faster so no one has any time to milk a reaction. And it's clear that Stan and Babe aren't terribly comfortable with that.One problem is that the oneliners aren't particularly funny. After a couple of viewings it still took me a while to realize that some of the lines were meant to be jokes. Laurel and Hardy try to punch up some of the gags with their usual physical shtick which is partially successful. The beginning of the film involves Stan manicuring a lawn with tiny scissors. The best gag is towards the end of the film involving a long plank of wood. Unfortunately it's not enough to make up for a stupid scene where the duo masquerades as businessmen or a later bit where Stan actually goes Woooooooo! like a drunken football fan completely unconvincingly.If you ignore the more embarrassing subStooges material you can get a few laughs out of this film. Stan and Babe have enough professionalism to not make any film a total loss. But there are better films to watch and this definitely is not the first film to introduce someone unfamiliar with Laurel and Hardy.".

Stan and Ollie did service comedies before and good ones.Darryl Zanuck just bent the plot a little. Dick Nelson plays the pampered rich kid like Lee Bowman in the other film. He's got two maiden aunts Mae Marsh and Ethel Griffies who treat him like he was in a plastic bubble and a quack doctor in Ludwig Stossel who's getting rich off their hypochondria about Nelson.Stan and Ollie are the butler and chauffeur of the estate and they join the army to look after Nelson. Truth be told he wants to join just to get away from those aunts.After that it's a series of a lot of gags per normal for a service comedy. I'm sure that Stan and Ollie had they been given a little more creative freedom might have come up with more original stuff. One thing that I liked was Stan's pet raven who won't leave him even though he's enlisted. It turns out Penelope the raven gives the bird to the enemy in the war games finale which also was imitating Buck Privates.And Nelson is involved in a romantic triangle with his sergeant Edmund MacDonald over the girl with photography concession at the PX Sheila Ryan. If you're on your toes you'll notice that the soldier who is buying his developed films from Ryan while Nelson is waiting is Alan LaddBest gag in the film involves Stanley trying to ditch Penelope in Ollie's pants during inspection and the havoc it causes. Second best is Ollie spilling water all over himself when Stan asks the time and then Stan doing it to him when Ollie asks for the time. Third best is the two of them hitching a ride on a target during rifle practice.Great Guns has its moments but it doesn't have the sustained humor of their stuff with Hal Roach.".

	schema:reviewBody "In one respect this is Laurel and Hardy's best movie particularly in terms of comic timing. No longer are there silent era delays in the action and no longer are there long setups before the comic act.  In this film the comic timing is quick and precise. A 1941 release before the attack on Pearl Harbor by only two months this is another of the proArmy nonspecific enemy movies. War had not yet been declared by the United States. However the draft had been operational in expectation of war in both Europe and the South Pacific. What this film does is to try to illustrate that the draft was fair and equitable and that the rich were also being called to serve. The movie suggests that the Army was a relatively nice place to be as Dan Forester the rich boy says I like the Army more and more each day. Stan and Ollie had joined to protect Dan from the pitfalls of Army life but who is to protect them from themselves? All in all it's a funny movie especially the first breakfast in the mess hall scene and the wrong side of the target range scene. In war and comedy timing is indeed everything.".

By this I mean unlike their shorts from the 1930s Stan and Ollie don't feature in every scene and that means there's the feeling that you're watching something that's diluted . Be honest  would you have put time aside to watch this if GREAT GUNS wasn't a Laurel and Hardy comedy ? This is similar to some other shorts where the duo find themselves in uniform and my opinion is prejudiced by the fact that I saw BEAU CHUMPS less than an hour before I started watching this one . Big mistake because the premise of both films aren't poles apart where Stan and Ollie find themselves giving up civilian life for the military You have to suspend a lot of disbelief as their young boss Dan Forrester find's himself drafted in to the army and so the boys decide to volunteer to keep an eye on him . It's difficult to believe any military would want a couple of middle aged men one of which is to put it kindly overweight  but I guess if reality interceded we wouldn't have a movie The story itself is rather threadbare and is along the lines of a gentle romantic comedy where Dan is taken to the female film developer at the barracks Ginger who is also the apple of the eye of the drill instructor Hippo . This plays out as you'd expect  light fluffy romance while you find yourself waiting for the next appearance of the comedy stars . The jokes aren't great but one very politically incorrect scene involving Hippo with his face blackened leading Stan to say  Oh how kind they've given us a porter  did make me burst out laughing As it stands GREAT GUNS isn't a great comedy and reading the trivia section it's revealed that the studio wouldn't allow Stan Laurel to develop the screenplay as he did in the Hal Roach shorts and this undoubtedly explains why the feature length films of Laurel and Hardy in the early 1940s are missing a certain something".

The best of the Post Roach L  H's is said to be JITTERBUGS 20th CEnturyFox 1944 with Vivian Blaine but that's another story Schultz! POODLE SCHNITZ!!";

The great comedy drought of '41 saw jokes in movies placed on a ration of just one per 75 minutes. Unfortunately Great Guns lasts for 74.Notwithstanding the brief step away to RKO in 1939 with The Flying Deuces this was the first of the duo's nine postRoach movies. To be fair while most of them are wretched this one isn't so awful despite the almost total absence of anything approaching a gag. While Laurel and Hardy had begun to decline since hitting anall time peak in 1937 Way Out West this was still only four years on and just a year after the reasonably amusing A Chump At Oxford. So it is that despite having no backup on the writing front and being acted off the screen by a crow they still manage to find some last residual laughs in the tank.Highlight has to be the parade lineup where they order the General to take their photo. Ollie's cry to Stan of Give it a little dignity briefly recalls some of the glory days as does Stan's earlier selfparodying We haven't eaten for three days Yesterday today and tomorrow. In the main though Stan and Ollie were living on reputation alone. The guest cast the leads of which are picked because they're photogenic and virtually none of them display comic timing react against L  H as if they're a couple of bozos but not because the duo are acting in any way strange. Even just being glanced standing perfectly normally in a lineup will produce outrage and some crankedup incidental music to cement the gag.Yes Stan and Ollie are rarely seen doing anything genuinely funny in a film past 1940 but we're led to believe they are by goodwill and past knowledge alone. Yet what if someone had never seen a Laurel and Hardy film before this? Surely it would fall down as two averagely amusing men lark about in thirdrate vignettes joined together in an approximation of narrative? If this was the first Laurel and Hardy film you'd seen you'd never know what the fuss was about something lost on Fox who promote their Stan  Ollie output on home video with a trailer announcing four of their bestloved movies. Isn't that against the Trades Descriptions Act?The humour is sometimes a little unsettling too. When a Sergeant has his face blackened in an explosion Stan and Ollie pretend not to recognise him Stan suggesting Look they've assigned us a porter. Much 'hilarity' ensues after which the General demands what are you trying to do put on a Minstrel show? For their 20s and 30s output it was a nave gesture a world away. But this is far too close to home not to be uncomfortable nowadays particularly as the 'joke' comes not from Stan's ignorance but from cognisant racial mockery. Maybe I'm reading too much into it just as 99 of the jokes about the boys seem to be solely related to how thick they are. Maybe they'll put me in the Intelligence Corps. Brother you're with him right now.Thankfully as poor as this is and there's a reason that a crow down your underpants never became a comedy staple Stan and Ollie are the moreorless the focus all the way through rather than playing support in their own movie. Jokes like Ollie checking the time and spilling his drink down his shirt seem old now but were possibly reasonably new then and still considered good enough to be homaged 43 years later in The Young Ones. Having said that the film drags on lifelessly for the whole second half so the best that can possibly be said is that it's bearable.".

	schema:headline " A Very Funny Movie with Laurel  Hardy";
	schema:reviewBody "As often as I dismay that our highschools and colleges are churning out people who cannot read and write I am regularly heartened by the pro level of writing in so many online reviews. In this set I found The beginning of the end by Jim Griffin a particularly thoughtful and wellwritten miniessay and I agree with all of his specific observations. On the other hand as accurate as I find all objections to the way this movie was made the negatives still do not outweigh the positives. Great Guns is very entertaining mostly briskly edited and funny enough to make me laugh out loud.Granted I felt a sort of cognitive dissonance while watching. It was embarrassing to watch LH playacting through the dopey oneliners saying things they would never say in their own world and the forced emotional responses dictated by the script then right after a poor moment I would be charmed their perfect timing and naturalness with a bit of physical comedy or some of their own dialogue. So all the way through I was about to cover my eyes and then I'd have to laugh. For me the most irritating characteristic of the script is it demands that LH continue to maddeningly coddle the Nelson character whereas I wanted to see them become sympathetic allies early on and use their special brand of clownresourcefulness help him have a little healthy adventure and romance. Dang could've been a good script...Folks Great Guns is not a Hal Roach LH movie. Forget about it. This is a 1941 Military Service movie with Laurel  Hardy. Accept it that way and you'll enjoy it. Swiss Miss and Chump at Oxford weren't much better.Imagine that someone asked two inveterate clowns to take leading roles in an army film and they agreed to do it. Stanley still gets a few magical moments like clipping the grass with tiny wire cutters and a bird on his shoulder and trying to shave with a lit light bulb in his mouth. Oliver shows off his physical deftness dancing with a crow and he can still begin to run without getting anywhere. And he's not so fat! See how incredibly dapper he looks in a tailored suit about 49 minutes into the film. Both comedians look in excellent health a little older now for sure but age happens. If Stan played the same otherworldly emptyheaded character of the Hal Roach years he would seem retarded here he seems a little more like a normal guy who's been a little too well sheltered in life and has a number of interesting eccentric mannerisms. A bit like a prototype Ed Norton. If LH are more paternal than usual I think it's a logical attempt at developing their personas to fit their age. It is regretful they did not get the chance to really work out the appropriate alterations to their characters as time altered their appearance.The last 20 minutes or so are a little slow but LH make it worthwhile with all their engaging little gesticulations and their excellent partnertiming. Only the last 7 minutes becomes boring with too much stock footage of war games. Cute ending though. To misquote another viewer's comment it's not a bad movie just not real LH movie. It's a little like LH agreed to impersonate themselves and if you don't mind that for 75 minutes the movie is a good 7 out of 10 that is a pleasant and betterthanaverage diversion for a Sunday afternoon. For comparison I suppose I would rate the Hal Roach Swiss Miss 6ish out of 10...although it is more pure LH it has the same romantic subplot problem as Great Guns plus dull unnecessary musical numbers.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Laurel and Hardy all my life but there came a point in their movie career where their distinct style of humor simply ceased to be. In their earlier films you had Stan with his endless Malaprops prompting Ollie's looks of disgust into the camera the physical comedy was brilliant and often led off by the duo selecting the most illogical and idiotic course of action possible for the bizarre circumstances in which they found themselves.Example You are delivering a piano. The door of the house is locked but you can get in through an upstairs balcony door. Do you put one person in through that door then have him come downstairs and open the main door for you to bring in the piano? No you try to bring the piano in through the upstairs door using a flimsy canopy as a mounting point for a block and tackle hoist! That is just an example of the kind of humor which made Stan and Ollie famous.Well all that seems to be gone in this movie. I got halfway through watching Great Guns and realized I had wasted as much time as I had spent watching it to that point  and I turned it off. If I have to watch more than halfway through a movie to get past the part that is an utter waste it's too far gone to redeem itself for me. While Stan and Ollie still looked much like their old selves in this film it's like they were almost afraid to be those two zany characters from their GOOD movies like they didn't feel like they could pull it off... like maybe they didn't believe in themselves anymore? Laurel and Hardy had a period in which they made brilliant comedies where you couldn't help laughing out loud at the sheer lunacy of their antics and the disasters which resulted. Like Stan trying to move a dump truck so Ollie could get his wife's new convertible out of its parking space and Stan works the lever that makes the dump truck unload tons of dirt onto the car. Or Stan visiting Ollie in the hospital and sitting on a hypodermic needle full of tranquilizer and Ollie ending up hanging out the window by his castwrapped leg. Those were Laurel and Hardy films which made them popular and famous deservedly so. This movie Great Guns is all talk talk talk most of that not very funny and little else. Yawn. I'm a big LH fan but I know I will never bother watching this film ever again. Phew! It's a sad movie not a comedy. It's simply not very funny and very little like the earlier films they'd made.".

	schema:headline " They Don't Make Them Like They Used To.";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a lifelong Laurel and Hardy fan having seen all their features and shorts from 19291940 I had never really seen the films they did with Fox. However I've heard nothing but bad things about them so I decided to let curiosity get the better of me and watch their first Fox feature Great Guns. I was expecting a departure from their usual quality brand of comedy but nothing could've prepared me for what I saw here. I had no idea it would THIS bad that Stan and Ollie would be THAT out of character and that this socalled movie would be THIS devoid of humor. I expected a pale imitator but this has to be seen to be believed. They have to TRY to make something this bad. So what is our story about? It begins with Stan and Ollie working as servants for a sickly young man named Dan Forrester. Despite apparently being allergic to everything under the sun Dan is an upbeat highspirited man and when his draft notice arrived he was only too happy to go. Despite Stan and Ollie trying to interfere in his examination Dan is given a clean bill of health and is going to war. But surprise surprise Stan and Ollie are conscripted to go with him and keep an eye on him. You know I'm starting to wonder if that boy was ever sick. Probably not. Anyway ordinarily someone with Ollie's girth would be disqualified from the army but at the 10th Cavalry they'll take anybody...except Stan's pet crow Penelope. Nothing interesting really happens at first the boys find a way to beat the line in the mess hall only to eventually have their food stolen. They inadvertently insult a colonel. When told they're going to be given an IQ test Ollie remarks maybe they'll put me in the Intelligence 'Corpse' which would've been more in character for Stan to say and then Ollie would say not corpse. He means Corps. 'Corpse.' Mmh! I mean 16 minutes into a Laurel and Hardy feature and you haven't laughed once is not a good sign. Well from taking horse riding lessons to even simply eating breakfast Stan and Ollie are always acting as Dan's overprotective mothers. It's something that gets old very quickly. After that the boys go out into the woods so finally alone you'd think here is where some classic LH can begin. Unfortunately not since the boys find themselves in the middle of an artillery exercise. They find an unexploded shell and hitch a ride on a traveling target at first not fully realizing they're being shot at. Come on writers Stan and Ollie are not THIS stupid! Anyway they manage to get back to camp and their snarky sergeant nicknamed Hippo inadvertently uses gun powder from the unexploded shell to light his pipe and it explodes giving him blackface. Now you remember the Amos and Andy and Sambo jokes from Pardon Us 1931? Acceptable kinda funny not meanspirited but this one goes to a whole new level. Stan and Ollie see Hippo in blackface and say look they've assigned us a porter and You may start over here my good man and you may have Thursdays off. Wow that's horrifically racist even by 1940s standards. By the way the 10th Cavalry was predominantly black so the joke's on them. Not that they'd notice.While all this madness is going on Dan has developed a crush on the PX girl Ginger. Unfortunately Sgt. Hippo has a crush on the same woman and he intends to make Dan's life a living hell as a result. Hippo's not the only one when Stan and Ollie find out they try to stop him for fear of his health. Oh come on! So they decide to pay Ginger a visit at her residence... by the way has anybody noticed that these new army recruits have an incredible amount of free time? On the verge of WWII you'd think they'd be training nonstop. But anyway they try to dig up some dirt on Ginger and dissuade Dan from seeing her but he doesn't listen. He's in love with her. So... get this Stan and Ollie deliberately get Dan in trouble with Hippo and get him sent to the brig. What the hell? That was so uncalled for. Also that's the end of the DanGingerHippo love triangle. The script didn't pay enough attention for us to care. So let's jump to the scene most people remember the Jeep ride. The boys drive a Jeep down a wild path in order to oversee construction on a bridge. However enemy troops are ready for them and when they predictably drive the Jeep into the river they're surrounded. What happens next? Well in a real LH comedy Ollie would say to Stan well here's another nice mess you've gotten me into and Stan does his usual crying bit. But here Ollie simply tells Stan to lock up the Jeep so it won't get stolen. Oh God. Anyway Dan commandeers a horse to go save his overprotective nannies the armies start fighting the enemy bridge is destroyed and the war games are over and Stan and Ollie get bumped to sanitation detail. The end.So in closing Great Guns is a mess. It's a very bad movie it's boring it's not funny and if this were just some silly '40s Bmovie that would be acceptable but this is Laurel and Hardy! The greatest comedy duo of all time. The men comedians for generations were inspired by and aspired to be like. Their work is genius it is respected it's genuine and most of all it's funny. You know this felt like I was watching a bad Laurel and Hardy parody... only starring Laurel and Hardy. I can't believe this it's like the writer and director were not familiar with their work at all save for the two jokes stolen from previous shortstrue fans can spot them. Stan reportedly hated these Fox movies and I don't blame him one bit. He was allowed NO creative control or input. This is what the studio system was like back then a dictatorship. You had to do exactly as you were told and if you tried to back out your reputation was ruined. I actually feel embarrassed watching this movie. Embarrassed for Stan and Oliver. They had no choice they had to do this and couldn't speak up. So yeah in closing Great Guns is a bad movie. Go watch some REAL Laurel  Hardy like The Music Box Sons of the Desert Helpmates Towed in a Hole Men O'War Laughing Gravy Way Out West ANYTHING but this! Hardcore LH fans will hate this movie. It's an insult. This is not a fine mess this is a huge mess!".

	schema:reviewBody "NTJNH is Arjun Sablok's first feature film. And it's a pretty good debut. The first half hour is the weakest part of the film with a song that should be cut too slow a pace and some tired Bollywood antics. But then the film gets momentum and starts to deliver. There are still lesser moments that pay unnecessary tribute to the 'formula' silly comedy bits a clichd gay character a herobeatsupmultipleadversaries scene... but they are outweighed by moments which show that the director has at times a firm grip on the various aspects of cinematic expression and uses his tools to good effect camera editing sound effects. There is a delightful party dancing scene which has only one fault it's too short. There is an equally effective scene involving a zipper. There is a comic scene that makes fun of Bollywood film making which directly leads into the inevitable declaration of love between hero and heroine and its expression in a song number all elegantly executed. Also impressive is the scene around the intermission and the tellmeyournamescene which culminates in a wedding song to name two more examples. Technically the film is uneven like almost all Bollywood films. Sharp shots and out of focus and filtered shots follow each other in random fashion without a recognizable concept. Color balance is off at times. Both can be seen on the DVD as well as on 35mm prints. The 3 leads are all doing a good job. Hrithik Roshan tends to overact in comic scenes but is on the other hand excellent in dramatic and emotional moments. Esha Deol has not got beauty queen looks but something better instead personality and charm. She has got talent. Saif Ali Khan plays once more a playboy which he can do on autopilot by now. He's good as well. The film is above average but suffers somewhat from using Bollywood cliches and a not terribly original story a variation of so many other Bollywood love stories. On the other hand the basic conflict is well established the drama works and the execution with a good cast lifts the material often on the level of solid workmanship and a few times beyond.".

It is a pretty ordinary film where writing is concerned telling the story of two good friends falling for the same girl without knowing about each other's feelings. The girl herself becomes engaged to one while being in love with the other. Yeh this is quite typical but the movie has its moments and is actually quite charming at some points especially the scenes involving Hrithik Roshan and Esha Deol. Otherwise the movie also has many moments of pure bore which seem to be the direct result of the director's attempts to make the movie slow in order to create a deep dramatic mood. I liked the songs Di Leke is very nice but my favourite song is Tum. The performance by the playback singer who sings it is not particularly good but the melody and the way the number appears on screen is quite effective. The movie stars Saif Ali Khan and he is very likable and believable in another role that is both comic and serious. Esha Deol is actually pretty good in one of her first roles but she once again tends to have a very serious expression on her face throughout the film. Maybe it's her own nature and way of being in real life which she is unable to erase when she is on screen but otherwise she is convincing. The one who dominates the show with a heartfelt portrayal of a quietly loving guy is of course Hrithik Roshan who plays the role with dedication and sincerity. The cast however is not reason enough to make the movie better than it was. Na Tum Jaano Na Hum is mostly an average product a decent onetime watch and nothing more.".

The film director Edouard Molinaro himself has lately called it a failure despite the fact he had succeeded in hiring Christopher Lee to incarnate ' the Count Dracula is never mentioned in the original version opposing him to a totally different kind of an actor Bernard Menez who is actually very proud of this film. The concept here is quite similar to another unfunny vampire comedy Tempi Duri Per i Vampiri where Lee was opposed to Renato Rascel.One should see this movie just to appreciate the almost perfect French accent of the British star who has almost entirely shot it in that foreign language.Mister Lee has claimed on several occasions he did dub the English version. I must be one of the rare French moviegoers to have seen the quite different American version and to be able to evaluate the mess they did on the soundtrack.Most of the dialog has been changed to some ridiculous vulgar trash. The haunting music score by Vladimir Cosma has been misplaced or changed in favor of new music bits supposedly to speed up the rhythm of the film.But they didn't hesitate the butcher the editing either from the 100 min. in its original form they reduced it to 79. Not only they shortened it but added some repetition of Lee opening a door and speaking to a concierge with several stupid accents. Not only unnecessary but very dull!

Appalling!I have heard Roman Polanski had to suffer similar treatments on his masterpiece Fearless Vampire Killers never try to compare this one to Molinaro's flick by the way!Not every one has the talent of Woody Allen to transform a Japonese spy movie into a comedy as he did once admitting it in a prologue with What's up Tiger Lily?.In conclusion here are two different films out of the same celluloid Dracula Pre et Fils is a not so good film worth seeing however. Dracula and Son is just awful and should be placed alongside with the Raymon Burr's version of Godzilla.".

	schema:headline " Dracula AND SON Edouard Molinaro 1976 12";
	schema:reviewBody "Two years after Christopher Lee claims he swore off horror Hammer and most importantly his signature role of Count Dracula we find him donning that very famous cape once again for this largely forgotten but surprisingly agreeable Gallic spoof. Thankfully the print I came across is an extremely goodlooking one emanating from Germany that is unfortunately accompanied by frankly awful English subtitles that often do not even bother to translate the intermittent German title cards! which soon forced me to rely on my knowledge of the French language acquired in high school all those years ago ironically I managed to acquire a corrected set of subtitles soon after I finished this first viewing of the film! Having said that the film occasionally lapses into Romanian during the early Transylvanian sequences English when Dracula is picked up at sea by a British vessel and lands in that country and Arabic when Dracula Jr. is taken in by a bunch of them upon first disembarking on French soil and while it runs for a slightly overstaying 93 minutes in the PALsourced print I watched it was reportedly much reedited when cut down to 79 minutes for its Americanized Englishlanguage version the end result got saddled with a  rating on the Leonard Maltin movie guide! Ultimately the film serves to show that even at 54 years Lee owns the role of the Prince of Darkness essaying it here for the last time even if the name Dracula is never actually uttered and it was an added pleasure hearing him speak his lines in perfectly fluent French! Indeed there are a steady flow of funny lines and situations to be found in the film Lee to his child Ferdinand finish your blood and go to bed! and Ferdinand don't play bowling with your mother's ashes Dracula's son as an adult  played by Bernard Menez who had appeared in TENDER Dracula itself 2 years earlier is so hesitant in plying his trade that when he is sent by his father to bite an old gypsy woman in the woods he ends up helping out with the cart she had been laboriously pushing behind her! Lee is at a loss for words when about to be thrown into the sea in a closed casket as to how they will manage to reach the surface the elder vampire bumps into the glass door of a modern British building when chasing after a prospective victim French character actor Raymond Bussieres offering Menez a bite to eat in a train station when the latter's bloodstarved stomach starts to make its hunger heard the son bites into a frozen corpse during a day job in a mortuary and is later sickened by the sheer overdose of blood available for him to sample in an abattoir their luggage is amusingly coffinshaped Dracula Jr. dumps his father's coffin out of a hotel window in a fit of rage Lee is taken into police custody when daylight is imminent after being suspected of lewd acts in a car! humiliatingly he is also being made to advertise toothpaste on TV commercials Lee pulls up his sheets in embarrassment when surprised by his young new conquest in his coffin etc.It goes without saying that this was not the first comic treatment of Dracula on celluloid nor would it be the last  LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT 1979 with George Hamilton at his suavest FRACCHIA CONTRO Dracula 1985 starring beloved Italian comedian Paolo Villaggio and Edmund Purdom as Dracula and Mel Brooks' Dracula DEAD AND LOVING IT 1995 starring Leslie Nielsen  and in fact. Lee himself had already sent the vampiric Count up in a muchearlier Italian spoof starring Renato Rascel TEMPI DURI PER I VAMPIRI aka UNCLE WAS A VAMPIRE 1959 but what I found surprising here is the fact that much like Roman Polanski's own somewhat heavyhanded spoof of the genre THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS 1967 this flawlessly replicates at least in the scenes set in Transylvania the Gothic atmosphere of a Hammer Horror down to a fullblooded pardon the pun music score by Vladimir Cosma notably the makeshift cross  formed by peasants from a hammer and sickle a' la Michael Reeves' THE SHEBEAST 1966  is not only able to hold vampires at bay here but also set them ablaze! Unfortunately the predictably upbeat ending is somewhat rushed with Lee meeting his demise in the way of his comeuppance in Hammer's first Dracula picture and Menez finding himself cured during a train journey merely by abstaining himself from drinking blood for so longor perhaps through the power of love since at the very end of the film we find him father to a brood of children one of whom bares his fangs in the closing freeze frame! with the girl MarieHelene Breillat who rather foolishly does not believe the vampire lore even if both father and son keep harping on it who had been the object of contention between the titular characters throughout the film. The actress was married to director Edouard Molinaro still a couple of years away from making his crossdressing international hit LA CAGE AUX FOLLES at the time and her younger sister controversial filmmaker Catherine has her last acting job for 16 years here prophetically we think she is being bitten but is actually getting it on with Lee in his coffin in an early scene from the film!".

Having said that the film occasionally lapses into Romanian during the early Transylvanian sequences English when Dracula is picked up at sea by a British vessel and lands in that country and Arabic when Dracula Jr. is taken in by a bunch of them upon first disembarking on French soil and while it runs for a slightly overstaying 93 minutes in the PALsourced print I watched it was reportedly much reedited when cut down to 79 minutes for its Americanized Englishlanguage version the end result got saddled with a  rating on the Leonard Maltin movie guide! Ultimately the film serves to show that even at 54 years Lee owns the role of the Prince of Darkness essaying it here for the last time even if the name Dracula is never actually uttered and it was an added pleasure hearing him speak his lines in perfectly fluent French! Indeed there are a steady flow of funny lines and situations to be found in the film Lee to his child Ferdinand finish your blood and go to bed! and Ferdinand don't play bowling with your mother's ashes Dracula's son as an adult  played by Bernard Menez who had appeared in TENDER Dracula itself 2 years earlier is so hesitant in plying his trade that when he is sent by his father to bite an old gypsy woman in the woods he ends up helping out with the cart she had been laboriously pushing behind her! Lee is at a loss for words when about to be thrown into the sea in a closed casket as to how they will manage to reach the surface the elder vampire bumps into the glass door of a modern British building when chasing after a prospective victim French character actor Raymond Bussieres offering Menez a bite to eat in a train station when the latter's bloodstarved stomach starts to make its hunger heard the son bites into a frozen corpse during a day job in a mortuary and is later sickened by the sheer overdose of blood available for him to sample in an abattoir their luggage is amusingly coffinshaped Dracula Jr. dumps his father's coffin out of a hotel window in a fit of rage Lee is taken into police custody when daylight is imminent after being suspected of lewd acts in a car! humiliatingly he is also being made to advertise toothpaste on TV commercials Lee pulls up his sheets in embarrassment when surprised by his young new conquest in his coffin etc.It goes without saying that this was not the first comic treatment of Dracula on celluloid nor would it be the last  LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT 1979 with George Hamilton at his suavest FRACCHIA CONTRO Dracula 1985 starring beloved Italian comedian Paolo Villaggio and Edmund Purdom as Dracula and Mel Brooks' Dracula DEAD AND LOVING IT 1995 starring Leslie Nielsen  and in fact. Lee himself had already sent the vampiric Count up in a muchearlier Italian spoof starring Renato Rascel TEMPI DURI PER I VAMPIRI aka UNCLE WAS A VAMPIRE 1959 but what I found surprising here is the fact that much like Roman Polanski's own somewhat heavyhanded spoof of the genre THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS 1967 this flawlessly replicates at least in the scenes set in Transylvania the Gothic atmosphere of a Hammer Horror down to a fullblooded pardon the pun music score by Vladimir Cosma notably the makeshift cross  formed by peasants from a hammer and sickle a' la Michael Reeves' THE SHEBEAST 1966  is not only able to hold vampires at bay here but also set them ablaze! Unfortunately the predictably upbeat ending is somewhat rushed with Lee meeting his demise in the way of his comeuppance in Hammer's first Dracula picture and Menez finding himself cured during a train journey merely by abstaining himself from drinking blood for so longor perhaps through the power of love since at the very end of the film we find him father to a brood of children one of whom bares his fangs in the closing freeze frame! with the girl MarieHelene Breillat who rather foolishly does not believe the vampire lore even if both father and son keep harping on it who had been the object of contention between the titular characters throughout the film. The actress was married to director Edouard Molinaro still a couple of years away from making his crossdressing international hit LA CAGE AUX FOLLES at the time and her younger sister controversial filmmaker Catherine has her last acting job for 16 years here prophetically we think she is being bitten but is actually getting it on with Lee in his coffin in an early scene from the film!";

She soon finds herself not only the interest of said count but before being turned into a vampire herself pregnant with his child. Soon after giving birth to her son Ferdinand Hermine accidentally succumbs to the rising sun leaving the count to raise his son on his own. Alas Ferdinand is not only a reluctant vampire but a bit of a goof who's rather help people rather than suck the blood out of them. In the mid 1970's a lot has changed Romania is now under communist rule and the vampires have to abandon their castle trying to seek refuge in the West. Unfortunately due to a botched burial at sea naturally the two gentlemen travel via coffins father and son get separated. Ferdinand lands in France where some friendly Arab guestworks take him under their wings and he is forced to make a living as good as he can. The elder vampire is more fortunate landing in England where he soon is discovered by a filmcompany as leading man in vampiremovies. Eventually father and son reunite but the harmony only lasts that long after falling in love with the same woman who happens to be the spittingimage of Hermine.French comedies are not everybody's cup of tea especially among the Englishspeaking audience which has less to do with the humoristic quality than the usually horrible dubbing that usually sucks the last grain of charm out of the films. However especially here in Germany one virtually grew up with the comedies of Claude Zidi Louis de Funes Pierre Richard and countless other comedians and directors.Director Edouard Molinaro a veteran of the comedic genre who would later produce the celebrated The Birdcage the original as well as the American remake obviously understood that a HorrorComedy doesn't necessarily means spoof a la Dracula  Dead and Loving It or Love at First Bite. Rather he combines elements of the classic HammerHorrorflicks and harmless often satirizing French comedies into one entity. The mix works rather well. There are moments of chill and gloom especially during the first quarter of the film set in Transylvania despite better knowledge that you're watching a comedy. The jokes are generally subtle satirizing the genre but never venturing into slapstick. To mention just a few examples the vampires being driven from their castle with a hammer and sickle turned makeshift crucifix Ferdinand being forced donate blood after being caught trying to feed at a bloodbank or the Count accidentally biting into the neck of a sexdoll the incredulous undignified look at Lees face is worth the price of admission alone.Sir Christopher Lee seems to have a ball with his performance which seems a little surprising since the actors disdain for having been typecast for years in the role is legendary and this was his 10th outing as the bloodthirsty count. Indeed Lee only accepted the role under the condition that the name Dracula would not be mentioned and that his Count  a Baron in the original version  should be a completely different figure. The director honored that wish  the distributing companies didn't as we can see from the title and in the English dub he is even identified as Dracula by name. But at least Lee pulls his full repertoire He can be regal charming even amiable is able to show his comedic talent which has often been neglected in other movies and as to be expected is at the same time raise some scares when necessary. Not to mention Lee has more lines in this film than in all his HammerDraculas combined which may have been a factor of comfort.I'll end the review with a word of warning if you come across this film in it's English dubbed version save your time and money. What this hack job of synchronization has done to the movie can only be described with the German word kaputt. Not only are the speakers completely incapable managing to make Ferdinand sound like some dorky version of Woody Allen but much of the dialog has been changed completely making it seems like your watching some vulgar sexcomedy from the 70's. As if to add insult to injury Vladimir Cosmas atmospheric excellent soundtrack has been deleted and replaced with some silly Discotunes. Do yourself a favor and stick to the French version if need be with subtitles or if necessary the Germandub which catches the original spirit rather well and has some excellent speakers.810".

	schema:headline " Christopher Lee's Dracula Parody";
	schema:reviewBody "Dracula and Son is a light and amusing if sometimes seemingly aimless vampire comedy. It's the last of nine Draculaesque movies starring Christopher Lee in the titular role that I've seen and I think that's all of them. Of the nine this one strays the furthest from Bram Stoker's novel indeed it's only mention of Dracula is in the title. Just like Dracula stars Bela Lugosi and John Carradine before him his career in the role ends in parody. I think Lee comes off a bit more dignified here than Lugosi in say Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein 1948 let alone the Ed Wood stuff or Carradine in Billy the Kid Versus Dracula 1966 and the later Nocturna 1979. Regardless Dracula and Son is better than some of the Hammer Dracula movies Lee made let alone the pathetic 1970 Franco adaptation he starred in.In this one Lee's Count sires a son after humorously conceiving in a coffin who ends up being something of a failure at following in his father's footsteps. Some of the film's best gags spring from the son Ferdinand Really is that the best name they could come up with? having difficulty learning the ways of the vampire from his father yelling at him when a child to finish drinking his blood to donating his own blood as replacement for a vat of plasma he accidentally ruined when caught trying to steal from a hospital. Not that Father doesn't have his own misfortunes such as when he bites into a rubber sex doll under the misconception that it's a real woman. My favorite jokes however are those selfreflexively based on Lee's reallife star image. In the film after leaving Transylvania the Count becomes a movie actor in England and naturally it's in the role of a vampire. Unlike in other Dracula movies the Count in this one is quite photogenic.Speaking of vampire lore I like that this film didn't adopt from the Hammer films vampires vulnerability to running water. And their death by sunlightsomething also absent from Stoker's novelis played out here ad absurdum with the vampires scouring for sewer entries when without their coffins as daybreak approaches. Another Hammer trademark a makeshift cross is employed here once in an amusing scene where Romanian communists make one out of a hammer and sickle. Even the reincarnation romance a device I detest in other Dracula movies the 1974 and 1992 Bram Stoker's Dracula ones i.e. works fairly well here. For one thing it gives the film some muchneeded plot development in its later part. And it develops into a quasiOedipus complex with a love triangle involving the Count and his son. More related to Stoker's book Ferdinand's befriending of other immigrants and minorities in France is an interesting although somewhat poorly developed twist on Stoker's xenophobic invasion plot.By the way I saw the original version and not the American butchered copy that others have decried. Beware however if you're a native English speaker like me good luck finding translations for the majority Frenchspeaking part of the film some scenes are in English. I relied on bad autotranslations and two years of university French that I've since forgotten.Mirror note This one is thankfully consistent with vampires not casting reflections a point that's important in the last of the film's three mirror scenes. The other two scenes are of the mother vampire crying when she discovers she has no reflection and of a prostitute screaming when she discovers Ferdinand to have no reflection in a ceiling mirror above a bed.".

As an adult that child Ferdinand Bernard Menez decides to try and live his own life and before long Dracula and son are separated. Dracula ends up landing in London where he's a successful actor. Ferdinand on the other hand ends up in Paris where he struggles to make much of a living.Dracula AND SON is out there in a couple different versions. I watched the uncut French version which clocks in around 95minutes and I'm going to guess that this is what most people will want to watch. The film was released in an American version which apparently ran 79minutes and featured someone other than Lee dubbing him. Even worse from what I've read is that some of the scenes appear to have been arranged out of order. The dubbing issue is an interesting one since in the French version there's a second done in English and Lee does his own voice.With that out of the way this film comes from director Edouard Molinaro who also did the landmark LA CAGE AUX FOLLES. Sadly this film isn't in the same league ballpark or planet for that matter and it's really too bad because this could have been an interesting idea. This was meant to be a comedy and sadly it's one of the unfunniest that you're going to see on the subject with there only being one great laugh and that's when Dracula goes to bite a woman and then notices that he has bitten the neck of a blow up doll.The majority of the film really drags at times and I must say that there wasn't a pinch of style to be found and I'd also argue that the film is incredibly lifeless and really doesn't have any energy to it. The direction is certainly flat throughout. All of that is too bad because Lee actually gives a good performance in the role although one shouldn't be expecting to see the same type of Dracula that he did in his Hammer pictures or his film with Jess Franco. This was the final time he played Dracula on the big screen so that reason alone makes it worth watching. I also thought Menez was good in his role but he honestly wasn't given too much to work with.It's doubtful either version of Dracula AND SON is going to appeal to many people. Fans of Lee will probably be the ones tracking down copies of the picture but sadly there's nothing overly good here outside of his performance.".

I also thought Menez was good in his role but he honestly wasn't given too much to work with.It's doubtful either version of Dracula AND SON is going to appeal to many people. Fans of Lee will probably be the ones tracking down copies of the picture but sadly there's nothing overly good here outside of his performance.";

Extensive cuts abominable presentations impenetrable dubbing reediting by distributors who were too clueless to just leave the movie alone and content that is too oblique for traditional critical appraisal.Dracula  Son has all of that going wrong to begin with and then some. Currently the film only exists  as far as I know  in an abominable unfunny disheartening 78 minute fullscreen hackjob recycled from a Columbia Pictures Home Video release from 1982. I adore Christopher Lee and have a thing for bizarre offbeat low budget European genre films. To say this movie sucks misses the point however that what we are seeing in the 78 minute English print is NOT the movie that was originally made in 1976. Until that turns up this will have to do. Ugh.History tells us that the film was shot in France and Yugoslavia in French with the multi lingual Christopher Lee first speaking his lines in English on camera which he sportingly dubbed into French himself for the original 96 minute version. For whatever reason Columbia Pictures who picked up the movie for distribution in Britain  America then had a voice actor redub Lee's voice back into English all over again when they finally got around to releasing it in the new world in 1979.Not only that but as seen in this English print everybody's voices have been redubbed by what sounds like American voice actors who liked to do tons of cocaine thought they were unbearably funny and got a kick out of Young Frankenstein with lots of dorkrod Brooklyn accents for Dracula his nebbish son Bernard Menez looking confused most of the time their fetching French love interest sexy MarieHlne Breillat and everybody else in the movie ... all of whom are obviously French and do not look like they grew up on Flatbush Avenue. Just watching the movie for the first time is an extremely painful experience and it's only after multiple forced screenings that some of the gags have started to become even mildly amusing.A bit more research however reveals some interesting information Dracula  Son is in fact Christopher Lee's final performance as Count Dracula to date. The film's basic story was apparently adapted from a novel of the same name. And this was the 2nd horrorcomedy vehicle for it's costar Bernard Menez for whom this was a 2nd try at mixing vampire thrills with a sexcomedy twist and starring a former Hammer Films bigwig after 1974's even more obscure Tendre Dracula with Peter Cushing in his only screen appearance as the Count. Which is a better film because they had less to work with had to push themselves and came up with more where it seems with Dracula  Son they had more money more access to locations  talents and less disciplined results.So I am not sure what to say about this movie. It's impossible to really judge it based upon what's left to see now after 30 years of neglect  abuse. How about this You should probably make a point to see it for yourself and if you find yourself not disliking it too intensely be pleased. Hopefully someone will restore this to it's complete length there's no way to really assess the film as it exists now. But something just tells me that even then it would still suck.310".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Michele Soavi gained worldwide recognition with his 1994 masterpiece Dellamorte Dellamore however he had been mastering his craft under the guidance of horror master Dario Argento for years before that hit. La Chiesa was his second feature length effort as director and he displays his craft with a visually stunning Gothic movie about possessions on the vein of Lamberto Bava's Demoni In fact it was conceived as the series third chapter but with Soavi's visual style all over it.La Chiesa or The Church is a tale of an unholy supernatural evil contained under a Gothic Cathedral. Centuries ago a group of Templar Knights brutally killed a town accused of being devilworshipers in order to keep the evil down they built a cathedral and sealed it. Now in the present a greedy librarian named Evan Tomas Arana breaks the seal and frees the forces of evil. The Church starts a selfprotection devise that serves to trap the evil but it also traps a lot of innocent people who become the target of the demons who begin to posses them.The movie is a visual TourDeForce where Soavi experiments with his outstanding camerawork creating haunting atmospheres of supernatural beauty. Complete with a terrific score with music not only by horror veterans Goblin but also by Prog rock virtuoso Keith Emerson and the remarkable composer Philip Glass. Their music works perfectly with the movie and completes the wonderful composition that Soavi creates.The Gothic Church is a character itself and Soavi gives it life and uses the location with great skill. The lighting and special effects are used with great care in order to increase the Gothic atmosphere of the film. Despite this the story is a bit weak and the surrealist scenes Soavi intends to use to increase the atmosphere actually decrease the coherence of his plot making it to drag a bit with scenes that seem to serve no purpose. This sadly becomes a major flaw in an otherwise flawless film.The acting is very good although the English dubbing is kind of average. Tom Arana and Hugh Quarshie are very good in the lead roles and Barbara Cupisti makes a great romantic interest. However two members of the cast remarkably steal the show. Feodor Chaliapin Jr. gives a great interpretation as the head Bishop of the Church giving a haunting performance as an old man with many secrets. The true star is young Asia Argento as Lotte the teenage daughter of the sacristan who prefers to be at discos than working at the church. Her character may be small but she shows her great talent and certainly shows why is she now the great actress she is today.As written above the strangely constructed plot is a major turn off as the last third of the film becomes very strange and a bit disappointing considering that the previous two thirds are a terrific haunting film. Still Michele Soavi's technique is always perfect and his visual perfection is never disappointing. It is no wonder why with a better script he crafted a masterpiece with Dellamorte Dellamore.La Chiesa may not be a perfect film but it is a very good experience and a good introduction to modern Eurohorror. It is a shame that Soavi has decided to stay on TV films because his stylish art seems to have no limits when correctly developed. Fans of Italian horror will be pleased with The Church. 710".

	schema:headline " Masterfully devilish chiesa";
	schema:reviewBody "Michele Soavi born in 1957 in Italy began as an assistant director for Dario Argento and the late exploitation king Aristide Massacessi before finally having the opportunity by Aristide to direct his first feature film Deliria aka Stage Fright in 1987. That film was a great example of his talents and it remains as one of the most suspenseful and inventive of the later day giallo related horror mysteries to come out from Italy. He also directed the atmospheric La Setta aka The Sect in 1991 and Dellamorte Dellamore in 1994 neither of these being as wonderful as his second film La Chiesa aka The Church from 1989 cowritten by him with Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini.The film opens with a slaughter of some sixteenth century village and its people as they're suspected of devil worshipping and other unacceptable antireligious things and so they get brutally killed and left dying buried alive. A huge cross was left on them to make it impossible for the demons to rise again and also a church was built on the corpses. In present day the huge cathedral is still there and serves very fine and safely until someone goes a little too far and plays with things that should have been left alone resting in peace. Soon the spirits rise and devilish goingson begin for the unhappy people who get trapped inside the huge church. But what really matters in this film is the talent of Soavi and his wonderful visual style and details to tell the story.The cinematography is always interesting in Soavi's films and La Chiesa too is full of wild camera drives and smooth movements as well as menacing angles to tell about the forthcoming terror. The details I mentioned are for example those black statues that inhabit the church some of which can also be very alive! Stage Fright has a very creepy usage of equally dead alive dolls that are captured on film with great power proving how Soavi can nail his audience to the seat with such simple images and things. Especially in La Chiesa in which we never even get to see the statues' dark faces..All the more ominous and wonderful.The various monsters and devils that rise from the beyond are also convincing and maybe because of they're not shown too much or for too long. They won't look unintentionally funny and laughable but pretty effective especially at the very end. The effects and bursts of infernal gore are pretty graphic but in a very aesthetic way never becoming too gross or revolting in this fairy tale they're present. The effects are by Sergio Stivaletti who has done effects for many Italian films like Lamberto Bava's Demoni 1985 and Dario Argento's La Sindrome di Stendhal 1996. The film gets also a little surreal at times which is of course great and among the most memorable parts are the scenes depicting the abyss under the church..as nothing like it is supposed to be there and it all is just too living again visualised with great usage of camera.The incredible Italian rock band Goblin has made many immortal soundtracks for Argento and their Keith Emerson music in La Chiesa is equally hypnotic variation of the conventional church organs with the usual Goblin elements like repeated lines that are very effective and make the viewing experience again very intense. This must be among the greatest things Italy has given to the world of movie composers alongside such other masters like Riz Ortolani Cannibal Holocaust Ennio Morricone Leone Il Grance Silenzio plus so many others Fabio Frizzi the Fulci composer and so on. But for the horror genre alone Goblins are probably the most powerful masters.Few flaws in the film can be found in the last third that is more tired than the wonderful first hour that preceded it. They just try to explain too much something that wouldn't need or wouldn't even be too possible to be explained and that is very frustrating as it doesn't give anything to the suspense and terror atmosphere that has been created only effectively tries to weaken it as the viewer starts to feel uncomfortable and also bored. Surreal and supernatural goingson don't always have to be explained in cinema let the images explain alone. Also some of the dialogue is a little exaggerated but that may be only in the English dubbing as the film has been widely distributed with the dubbing. There's also some bad and confusing editing especially near the end when things start turn more dramatic but other than these La Chiesa is another horror masterpiece by Soavi who has so far made only few horror films plus a very interesting Argento documentary Dario Argento's World of Horror in 1985 but who has also proved great talents and ideas to make the already wonderful Italian horror cinema genre even more masterful. La Chiesa is 810 and a very noteworthy example of Italian gothic horror cinema with beautiful settings and locations and equally stunning usage of camera fantasy and sonic elements.".

	onyx:emotionText "Michele Soavi born in 1957 in Italy began as an assistant director for Dario Argento and the late exploitation king Aristide Massacessi before finally having the opportunity by Aristide to direct his first feature film Deliria aka Stage Fright in 1987. That film was a great example of his talents and it remains as one of the most suspenseful and inventive of the later day giallo related horror mysteries to come out from Italy. He also directed the atmospheric La Setta aka The Sect in 1991 and Dellamorte Dellamore in 1994 neither of these being as wonderful as his second film La Chiesa aka The Church from 1989 cowritten by him with Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini.The film opens with a slaughter of some sixteenth century village and its people as they're suspected of devil worshipping and other unacceptable antireligious things and so they get brutally killed and left dying buried alive. A huge cross was left on them to make it impossible for the demons to rise again and also a church was built on the corpses. In present day the huge cathedral is still there and serves very fine and safely until someone goes a little too far and plays with things that should have been left alone resting in peace. Soon the spirits rise and devilish goingson begin for the unhappy people who get trapped inside the huge church. But what really matters in this film is the talent of Soavi and his wonderful visual style and details to tell the story.The cinematography is always interesting in Soavi's films and La Chiesa too is full of wild camera drives and smooth movements as well as menacing angles to tell about the forthcoming terror. The details I mentioned are for example those black statues that inhabit the church some of which can also be very alive! Stage Fright has a very creepy usage of equally dead alive dolls that are captured on film with great power proving how Soavi can nail his audience to the seat with such simple images and things.

Michele Soavi from Alan Jones's Profundo Argento'My brief to Michele was for him to explore the feelings I had about life in contemporary Germany being the beginning of a new Middle Ages. Michele made the Hitler references and evil allusions work.' Dario Argento from Profundo ArgentoDirector Michele Soavi's The Church is unlike any horror film you will ever watch. To say it is merely horror however is a mistake. This is an incisivecritique of the crimes of the Vatican over centuries the sinsofintolerance and the demons they giverise to. Coupled with newer theories on magical geometry in 1988anyway as well as the studies of European Cathedrals and their connections to occultlore and symbology Soavi Dardano Sachetti and Argento weave an allegory of how evil the roots of organized faith are. One could say that this is a truly Medieval story within a Medievaluniverse that is similar to the one held by the Manicheanheresy Cathars. As in Cemetery Man our Earth is portrayed as a dominionofevil where mankind is unable to transcend an architecture that prohibits redemption at everyturn. A trap not made by God but by a lowerentity. In this universe the world is a prison created by greaterpowers and forces. Like the prisonworld of Gnosticism Soavi hints that we are prone to Lords of this World Archons and that humanwisdom has been withheldparticularly femininewisdom which is absent in most orthodoxfaiths.Soavi doesn't seem to holdout much hope for redemption here but I find that is a theme in his early films. This connects him thematically with directors like Fritz Lang who posit a fateful universe and a terminal humancondition determinist. This is a very modern viewpoint ironically since he places it in a Medievalcosmology a nicetrick! If you are a student of occultlore and symbology this film is a real treat. It is peppered with imagery that surely has a subconscious effect on viewers. Because of this I found it created a GREATER senseofdread when I watched it and many scenarios and images are intentionally archetypal. Real Cathedralfriezes are flashed throughout the film and there is a genuine meaning for their placements thematic meanings. If you find the storyline a little meandering this is why. Most of this film is about themes and symbolicmeaning rather than a linearplot though it does have that. A number of shots in the film demonstrate that some of this film was shot in Germany but there are definitely images taken from manyother Cathedrals inEurope. The main interiors were done in a Cathedral that needed restorationfunds in Hungary.The Church also seems to be saying that the Catholichierarchy has something to hide in her origins literally coveringitup by building a Cathedral over the site of a massacre by Teutonic Knights directedby the Medieval Church of a group of peacefulheretics. Clearly the sect represents the AlbigensiansCathars but it can be generalized to the many faiths that were crushed by Christian orthodoxy including esoteric Christian and pagan ones. Because of this suppression a valuablechunk of humanthought culture and experience has been hidden the definition of occult from the average person. The results have been unfortunate with an anemic modern existence of meaninglessness madeworse when orthodox Christianity's dogma has fallenaway particularly in Europe. What has JudeoChristianity had to offer women that the cult of Isis did not? A lot less as it is patriarchal offering only the unnatural Mary as a motherarchetype rather than an image of real motherhood and empathy. PrimitiveChristian beliefs surrounding reincarnations are also present in the plot line mostparticularly in Asia Argento's character Lotte. Infact nearlyall the principlecharacters are reincarnations from the Medievalprologue! Oncecrushed faiths sometimes reemerge to overtake orthodoxones.Having littletooffer we see why the Church and Islam and Judaism had to borrowfrom pagan religionsa barbaric patriarchy didn't have much to offer people psychologically. The ancients knew that the mind needs symbols that are healing comforting and empathetic. Between heavenandhell there is man their source. As above so below. Hermeticwisdom teaches us that the universe is contained inmicrocosm in mankind and Soavi express this well. Wisdom cults of the Hellenistic age were wellaware that religion is symbology and littleelse. Religion is psychology and Soavi's film is very expressionist. Earlypsychoanalysts like Jung and Freud used mythological metaphors and terms for a goodreason they resonate with meaning overtheages. Isis is ALL women Zeus is an aspect of ALL men and Apollo's androgynous wisdom represents aspects of bothsexes. Ignoring these aspects of humanity is what breeds demons. The Church standsaccused. Some would say this film and review are antiCatholic but they would be wrong. The authors of The Church have stated manytimes they are still Catholic and this author was baptized as one. We just love what is good about faith and spirituality and shun what is hateful about it. An incredible film directed by a genius. Try the Anchor Bay edition it's widescreen with an excellent transfer for image and sound. One reviewer noted wrongly that Goblin did the scoreit was Claudio Simonetti ofGoblin Phillip Glass and others. PS The Church was originally slated to be the official Demons 3 as part of the Argento franchise but didn't endup being that film. The Ogre has been arbitrarily given the Demons 3 title by the owners of that film. It has norelation to the other Demons films and easily surpassesthem.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the middle ages a group of Knights slaughter a village full of suspected devil worshippers and a large cathedral is built on their burial pit. The church is now being reworked on and when the seal from the crypt is broken by the new librarian Evan slowly the occupants become possessed. An ancient mechanism is triggered off and a group of visitors find themselves locked inside with this relentless terror of madness and lust.If you could ever say style very much over substance director Michele Sovai's lavish Gothic horror piece The Church falls comfortably into that category. Originally it was going to be the third entry of the Demons films But Sovai shaped it into what he wanted. Obviously the familiar groundwork of those films is still presented here as this time the action takes place in a church where the trapped characters are eventually possessed. However it does take its time before the demented mayhem eventually erupts. Even then the splatter isn't particularly grisly with more concern on the brooding atmosphere striking art direction and gorgeously shot set pieces. The pacing might be terribly bumpy but Renato Tafuri's dramatic flashes with the camera provide the film's main energy. Even the musical score by Keith Emerson and The Goblins stays fairly sombre but poignantly effective nonetheless. What really lets this one down is the messy and inconsistent writing. Dario Argento Franco Ferrini and Michele Soavi contributed to the material. Too much of it seems rushed and undeveloped where the base of it was an inventive reworking that well thoughtout but there's too many loose ends. The script is pretty simpleminded even with its religious structure but it's not as compelling as it should be. At least your eyes have something to glaze over as Sovai's slowgrinding and densely detailed approach infuses some visually poetic images with a slowly surreal and claustrophobic feel making its way in. He makes great use of the shadows and lighting within welletched infrastructure of the ominously sedate but remarkably succulent looking cathedral. The demon makeup effects are wellexercised and look disturbingly menacing. Performances are hard to judge because characters do seem to come and go. Tom Arana Hugh Quarshie and Barbara Cupisti are solid. Also there's a fine turn by Feodor Chaliapin Jr. as the tormented Bishop and a young Asia Argento really does impress with her talented performance.Accomplished direction professionally catered production and a polished look help out on the problems facing its flat confused material. Worthalook.".

Even then the splatter isn't particularly grisly with more concern on the brooding atmosphere striking art direction and gorgeously shot set pieces. The pacing might be terribly bumpy but Renato Tafuri's dramatic flashes with the camera provide the film's main energy. Even the musical score by Keith Emerson and The Goblins stays fairly sombre but poignantly effective nonetheless. What really lets this one down is the messy and inconsistent writing. Dario Argento Franco Ferrini and Michele Soavi contributed to the material. Too much of it seems rushed and undeveloped where the base of it was an inventive reworking that well thoughtout but there's too many loose ends. The script is pretty simpleminded even with its religious structure but it's not as compelling as it should be. At least your eyes have something to glaze over as Sovai's slowgrinding and densely detailed approach infuses some visually poetic images with a slowly surreal and claustrophobic feel making its way in. He makes great use of the shadows and lighting within welletched infrastructure of the ominously sedate but remarkably succulent looking cathedral. The demon makeup effects are wellexercised and look disturbingly menacing. Performances are hard to judge because characters do seem to come and go. Tom Arana Hugh Quarshie and Barbara Cupisti are solid. Also there's a fine turn by Feodor Chaliapin Jr. as the tormented Bishop and a young Asia Argento really does impress with her talented performance.Accomplished direction professionally catered production and a polished look help out on the problems facing its flat confused material.

	schema:reviewBody "Though originally conceived as another entry in Dario Argento's Demons series the first two having been directed by Lamberto Bava this instead plays like an unofficial sequel to Argento's Inferno. The story concerns a librarian searching for...something in a Gothic cathedral convinced that the architect's secrets will grant him power. This cathedral was built over the mass grave of suspected witches killed by Teutonic Knights however so instead he unleashes some demonic spirits! The baroque architecture fascination with alchemy and weird symbolism all recall Inferno but the second half of the film still bears traces of its Demons lineage. It's at this point that a large group of wacky characters are trapped in the church and soon find themselves battling their own inner demons. While the threat here is largely psychological rather than physical the characters are threatened by disturbing hallucinations and violent impulses rather than drooling monsters many of the stock characters feel like holdovers from the Demons films. An old woman who insists on using words like groovy and fab a comically crotchety old man and a bickering biker couple for instance often feel too goofy to really gel with Soavi's more sophisticated take on the material. It's hardly enough to sink the film though which is certainly one of the more dignified productions to emerge during the last gasp of Italian horror. Here we can still see a strong Argento influence in Soavi's style  not surprising considering Argento's handson approach to producing  but he avoids the saturated color palette of Argento's fullon horror films. If not for that this could easily be seen as an unofficial entry in the Three Mothers trilogy and sadly a far superior one to La Terza Madre. Highly recommended!".

The characters and their stories are well developed and it's cool how they all come into play at the end and you see WHY they're a main character. You feel like you know these people from how well their characters are portrayed. The acting is mostly great one notsogreat moment that stands out is when Lotte is in the club and wants to go home the acting here is overly dramatic and unbelievable the angles that some scenes are shot from are original and awesome and help imply the importance of some things which you won't realize until later the overall background for the movie is great and thankfully isn't too modernified to show that the story takes place in modern day with just the right mix of old and new bringing together the fact that this takes place in an ancient church but modern day. And the special effects and gory scenes there isn't much gore are for the most part creepy and well done not over the top or showy.A lot of the effects are well worth mention but you should just see them for yourself. Some of the things that happen can only be seen by that person it's happening to.. awesome idea very creepy.

In that particular field Soavi is almost on the same level as the more praised Maestro with some amazing camerawork that knows no boundaries taking full advantage of it's eerie church setting.

	schema:reviewBody "This film had something like 6 different people working on the script and the end result of short on logic mild on scares and yet intriguing. I enjoyed Michele Soavi's other two big films Deliria and Cemetery Man and I wish he'd come back to making horror movies. There's a lot going on in this flick and more often than not things don't make sense. The basic premise of the plot is that hundreds of years ago Teutonic Knights with helmets that look like slapdash buckets are led to a supposed village inhabited by lots of witches. This particular scene is one of my favorites in the movie with armored assailants running amok in the town cutting off heads and using their horses to trample the hapless villagers. In my opinion the villagers are innocent of their crimes of witchcraft as the only evidence against them is a 666 carved in a rock which anyone could have done and a girl has a crossshaped mark on the sole of her foot misinterpreted as the stigmata. I think the writers are saying something about all churches in general when they infer that this church is built on top of brutal evil event perpetuated by the early religious order and that if you dig deep enough in just about any religion you will find some things that the elders want to remain hidden either out of shame or concern that it will destroy the foundation of the religion etc. This isn't a serious attack on religion especially seeing as how this was initially intended to be Demons 3 and got several reworkings to end up where it is. The scenes within the cathedral are the spookiest with the camera racing around the different rooms and the dank lower recesses in unusual angles. Another aspect of the movie that sort of has a HitchcockPsycho feel is that you expect the two characters introduced in the beginning to be the heroes which certainly isn't the case and while the actual hero has a few scant scenes near the start of the movie he doesn't really become the protagonist until about the last 20 minutes or so. And since Dario Argento is producing the film Asia Argento has to show upnatch. She's sort of a lolita running about at all hours sneaking out of the cathedral through secret passages dancing it up at the local club with older boys etc. There are also a few good gore scenes like a heart removal. The ending is ambiguous and the film closes after the destruction of the church with the possessive blue light shining up from a broken seal onto Asia's face. Seems she is the reincarnation of one of the villagers. She smiles slightly as she sees the light which has some viewers thinking maybe she was being possessed and would carry the evil into the world as the Bishop expectedThe Bishop by the way seems to be reliving a recent role he played in the excellent Name of the Rose. I however don't think she was possessed. I think the murdered souls were released and sought revenge against all those present in the church at the time of their release and at the end Asia was merely seeing the souls of those she had known in a past life. Since she was allowed to escape from the church and live it's doubtful she was possessed. But as I said there is not much logic to the film. I don't blame Soavi for that considering the source material. Recommended for fans of Soavi not so much for fans of Argento or the unrelated Demons 1 and 2.".

	schema:reviewBody "On paper The Church appears to have a winning formula. Its pedigree consists of direction by Argento protg Michael Dellamorte Dellamore Soavi input from the master Dario Argento in both writer and producer roles a soundtrack by the likes of Goblin and Keith Emerson and a capable cast.Despite this the film is a hesitant recommendation. For me it doesn't quite gel. It's a little like Demons but without the cheesy charm and outrageous pace it comes as little surprise that this film was almost named Demons 3. I didn't expect a brilliant plot but the film is genuinely clunky and makes the unforgivable error of actually losing tension and descending into boredom territory. I found myself clock watching at more than one interval during the proceedings. There are some excellent setpieces though the best of which uses a simple windscreen to glorious effect. Also fans of rubbery demons of which I count myself as one will not be disappointed.Despite the talent involved the soundtrack manages to be a little overpowering and repetitive.Turning to the cast Asia Argento fans will be able to see her in one of her earliest roles before she became one of cinemas true bad girls. The excellent Hugh Quarshie genre fans will know him as the immortal Kastagir from Highlander and Panaka from the dreadful Phantom Menace but UK television viewers will know him as Ric Griffin from Holby City is a solid lead.The film's worth watching if you're a fan of Italian supernatural horror. It's not for everybody though. Aside from Suspiria Demons is probably a stronger bet for the newcomer than this offering. As a little Jedi would say Strong visuals alone do not good films make!".

Its pedigree consists of direction by Argento protg Michael Dellamorte Dellamore Soavi input from the master Dario Argento in both writer and producer roles a soundtrack by the likes of Goblin and Keith Emerson and a capable cast.Despite this the film is a hesitant recommendation. For me it doesn't quite gel. It's a little like Demons but without the cheesy charm and outrageous pace it comes as little surprise that this film was almost named Demons 3.

	schema:reviewBody "I usually go for Italian horror due to it's tendency to be quite gory. So naturally when i heard this was somehow related to DEMONS 1 and 2 which i am a big fan of I had to track it down. It really had nothing to do with those films but I was far from disappointed.Instead of following the possessed Movie TheatreTV Screen plot it's about an ancient cathedral that becomes infested with evil. The church is built over a mass grave of victims of a medieval massacre which we get to see at the beginning of the film. The religious authorities condemn an entire village of being evil or whatever and demand that they be slaughtered. The evilness is released thousands of years later when some dude starts snooping around the Cathedral. A bunch of people get locked inside and some get possessed. Anyway I usually watch movies for gore violence monsters and special effects rather than the plot so I won't give away how it all goes down.While definitely not as gory as the DEMONS movies It does have have a few sweet gore scenes. What it lacks in gore it makes up for in atmosphere it takes place in a Gothic Cathedral has some pretty trippy hallucinations and a really captivating musical score.It also has some cool deaths and a couple cool monsterdemon scenes which is always a plus. Barely any nudity aside from a couple quick nipple shots but I can't complain because there is a brief scene where a Goatlike monster probably Satan himself is having sex with a chick!I recommend this to not only fans of Italian horror but to all horror fans Excluding those of you who are into today's computer generated PG13 garbage".

	schema:reviewBody "I am such a huge fan of Michele Soavi. I absolutely adore Stagefright the best slasher ever. Dellamorte Dellamore is quite simply a Gothic masterpiece a near perfect zombie film with a philosophical overtone to it. I also thought The Sect was a quite effective nervejolter filled with incredible surreal images and solid scares. So I was disappointed after viewing The Church I had such high hopes.It starts of well enough. Medieval knights massacre a village they fear is possessed by demonic spirits and the priest orders that a church should be built on their buriel ground. Fastforward to the present something weird is going on in that church some evil seems to be lurking about and possessing people. A showdown between good and evil is unavoidable.The film has style to burn. Michele Soavi is a master at creating surreal imagery and his camera knows no limits. This is the film's high point along with some terrific set pieces one in particular involving a subway and a teenage girl. Another thing I must mention in the film's favour the music score. It's always wonderful to hear Goblin and Keith Emerson also provides some good music. But good music is simply something you can always count on in these Italian productions.The thing that doesn't work here and it's a big thing is the plot. It's practically nonexistent. The film doesn't make any sense jumps from one setpiece to another though some are brilliantly executed with only so little to tie them together. It's got wooden characters none you really care about Tomas Arana in particular. The final showdown in the Church although well done in terms of effects is a real letdown nothing much happens and in the end well...I felt cheated in a big way.As it was originally conceived of as the second sequel in the Demons saga I expected this to be full of violence. It's not apart from the rather gory opening. I guess Soavi wanted to do a more serious film with some philosophical input or something. He should have had a better script to work with.Although it's disappointing it's certainly not without interest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pretty good Itallian horror flick with some creepy atmosphere. This is a very artsy type horror film full of striking visuals  incredible camera work by director Michelle Soavi and the very creepy atmosphere help make this a very enjoyable Itallian horror movie. all the main characters were cool except the ones in the 2nd half they were all pointless characters that were annoying and whiny. All the deaths were great and creative and plus Michelle Soavi's crazy direction. There is plenty of gore. We get a crushed face 2 decapitations lots of bloody corpses people are buried alive a bloody cut ripped out heart a crazy impaling with a jackhammer that's very messy you see guts and other nasty stuff fence impaling in the throat statue impaling a woman's face gets crushed by a subway and a girl ripping her face off very messy. The acting is okay but nothing spectacular. Tomas Arana was creepy and did okay here but didn't have much to do.Barbara Cupisti was cute and did what she had to do well here. Asia Argento is adorable and she was great here although she looked VERY young. Hugh Quarshie was great as Father Gus and was my favorite character here although the bad dialog didn't help him at times. Giovanni Radice had brief role and did what he had to do. Overall i highly recommend this! 12 out of 5".

	schema:headline " Stylishly Blithering Incoherent Mess";
	schema:reviewBody "I was initially interested in this film after reading a synopsis and seeing a few striking screenshots and the promise was there for a gripping horror film of the Dario Argento style. Admittedly I must say that Argento's films have occasionally been rather incoherent and some feel like a handful of visually impacting set pieces loosely strung together with a vague connecting plot.Since Argento is credited as writer for this I have to say I'm not really surprised. Even his masterpiece Suspiria when examined exhibits the same tendency to string along sometimes unrelated scenes purely for the aesthetic impact. However Suspiria also had the benefit of a singular main character and clear antagonists as well as scenes that contributed ultimately to the eventual resolution.The Church on the other hand has none of these things. It has no main character no protagonist whatsoever it furthermore has no real plot to speak of and no crescendo no climax no denouement and no resolution. It is a completely hollow incoherent work that views as if Argento sat down and thought 'hey that would make an interesting scene visually...let's do it!' The film is a series of these scenes.Initially it might be interesting and Soavi's direction is excellent I must say. Soavi cannot be faulted for the material as it is made as compelling as possible. However such good direction calls attention to the horrible failings of the script and there is absolutely no sense in it. The attempt at a central unifying plot is nothing more than plagiarism of Carpenter's film Prince of Darkness. Events happen solely because the script wishes them to and reactions to those events are completely implausible. The narrative flow is irreparably damaged after a point simply because there is no ability to suspend disbelief it's too ludicrous. Added to this are numerous factual errors that are so glaringly showcased that it becomes embarrassing.If it had been more overtly artistic and edited down into a different work it might have been chilling or tense. If it had been fleshedout into an actual cohesive narrative it might have been gripping. But it was none of these. The best it managed was confusing and at times infuriating. Plots are introduced but never followed. Characters are forgotten about and altered arbitrarily. No logic is ever applied to any situation. It might have been scary or interesting but to elicit that sort of feeling takes more effort on the part of a screenwriter...much more.All in all The Church is not worth viewing for anyone but total enthusiasts of Italian horror that is more style than substance. This is Argento's style at its worst and it is a strong justification for the usual criticism.".

The carcasses are then lugged into a pit and buried a priest proclaiming the need of God's house to be built upon the spoiled earth to contain some vague connotations of ultimate evil that aren't elaborated on until said evil is let loose by a librarian centuries on to run amok claiming more annoying 80's characters in standard messy methods.

All of this in wild wacky camera movements  menacing angles galore.Originally conceived as the 3rd installment of Bava's brainless but exhilarating Demons series Michael Soavi brings his nuanced eye to The Church. It s got more style more atmosphere  more high mindedness than Bava's everythingbutthekitchensink saga. Soavi's background as the son of painter and protg to master Argento who also contributed to the screenplay is obvious in the elaborate compositions and arty flourishes which unfortunately still can't elevate the weak script  lack of focus other than as a big dig at Catholicism's overflowing closet of skeletons which is also nice. In this way the film succeeds hoisting an original clothesline for some neat setpieces that don't always rely on gore but instead evocative atmosphere the church's past deeds literally back to haunt future generations. Also Soavi's more subtle treatment of evil contagion works better than Bava's rampaging puss spewing plague. Perhaps a little more emphasis towards the ick factor would've have been nice though Soavi could've had his cake and eaten it to also check out the primo prog band of Italian horror themselves Goblin who supply the tunes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I start I wish to make it clear that I am in no way an expert on Italian cinema. American yes European not in the slightest. After having made my way through nearly every worthwhile American movie ever made I've decided to go on to the European ones. While many are pretty good you always get a dumb one or two I find the experience somewhat tainted by my background in American cinema.I watched Prince of Darkness a few months ago. It was good  not nearly as scary or as well made as I would have expected from John Carpenter. The Church was probably a better movie. Prince of Darkness took too many elements from Carpenter's older films like Assault on Precinct 13 so it did lack in some ways. However having seen Prince of Darkness a film very similar to this one I knew what to expect. It reminded me of other similar titles as well.

After having made my way through nearly every worthwhile American movie ever made I've decided to go on to the European ones. While many are pretty good you always get a dumb one or two I find the experience somewhat tainted by my background in American cinema.I watched Prince of Darkness a few months ago. It was good  not nearly as scary or as well made as I would have expected from John Carpenter. The Church was probably a better movie. Prince of Darkness took too many elements from Carpenter's older films like Assault on Precinct 13 so it did lack in some ways. However having seen Prince of Darkness a film very similar to this one I knew what to expect. It reminded me of other similar titles as well.

Picking up where the first two Demons films left off is The Church putting the Soavi touch on what could have been another Bava splatterfest. While Lamberto Bava's work is truly enjoyable and he is capable of intricate tales see Macabre Soavi has a bigger deeper philosophical vision that he incorporates into his work and it pays off for the audience.Michele Soavi fully admits the story was handed down to him The treatment is Argento's therefore everything in the film generally is based on his ideas which he worked out with Ferrini and Bava. But he added his own spin I turned what was conceived as schlock pizza cinema into a strong essay on karma and the ambiguous inner conflicts we all face at some time in our lives. Reviewer Jim Pyke agrees that this film turns out to be a meditation on karma and how people bring evil onto themselves but extends the meaning to say that At moments Soavi even suggests that we create evil with our own actions even if we may intend otherwise. Soavi really enjoys the artistic visuals such as a cross falling down a bottomless pit... it's beautiful imagery symbolic of the coming evil. We also get typing of incessant 6s juxtaposed with classy shots of fingernails being painted and a girl leaning back in a chair. This is of course Asia Argento before she was the erectioninducing Asia Argento who may be very young but has a prominent role.Jim Pyke also admires the visuals when he says Soavi's sharp eye for lighting and composition manage to turn fairly unoriginal and disorganized material into a riveting unsettling portrait of a church full of people each discovering their own private and individual hells. The soundtrack should also be singled out. While there is some rock music it is less abrasive than in the first two Demons films and there is more of a score here with Simon Boswell's Imagination and some pieces inspired by Phillip Glass.Mike Mayo sums up the primary complaint about The Church when he says Unfortunately director Soavi and cowriters Argento and Franco Ferrini lose sight of their main characters and shift the focus in the second half to a group of largely unknown strangers who are dispatched straightaway. And this is true that the plot and character development fall to pieces in the third act when the tourists arrive... but if we keep in mind this is a Demons film and it should therefore be full of senseless slaughter it's easily forgivable.Jim Harper calls it an arguably more enjoyable and coherent film than both Phenomena and Opera. Now I wouldn't go that far  Phenomena remains one of my favorite films with Opera ranking up there as well. Coherence aside the enjoyment factor for me is not more distinguished in one film over another of these three.But Harper is absolutely right when he says that The Church is one of the best Italian horror films of the decade and a worthy successor to the works of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. With all due respect to Lamberto Bava it is Michel Soavi who has picked up the reins from these Italian horror masters.".

One doesn't have the virtual insurance that nearly every Disney film at the time offered that everything would work out in the end so the moments of suspense and danger have a real edge.

As it introduces an enduring franchise the first Flipper effortlessly overcomes its flaws mainly parts that go on too long and look more repetitive and ordinary in hindsight. The catchy theme song for example will soon be improved upon and given its logical place over the credits. The film opens with an exciting hurricane and features beautiful location and underwater photography throughout. If you know Flipper the film offers many origin story firsts topped by the meeting of Sandy and Flipper. Pete the Pelican is around along with many familiar elements. The Ricks family lineup is different however mother Maguire is present but no Bud.The Flipper character is played by Mitzie and others undoubtedly. The A Boy and His Dolphin concept is terrific and the Flipper character retains its integrity through ensuing years. Halpin is very cute and seems to improve his performance over the run of the film his cavorting scenes are charming. Mr. Connors and Ms. Maguire are great parents  they make up much more natural family than expected. Joe Higgins who also appears in the next Flipper and Jane Rose who also appears in the first Dark Shadows are among the supporting players. Note that Connors' friend who dies during the hurricane is mentioned as not of our faith this add some depth to the film.  Flipper 81463 James B. Clark  Chuck Connors Luke Halpin Kathleen Maguire".

	schema:reviewBody "Flipper is a very old movie released in 1963. Though I have always been fascinated by dolphins and even worked as a dolphin researcher I never saw the movie put off by that silly King of the Sea song. The movie is much better than I expected. It was done before animatronics and CGI yet the stunts were completely believable. I worry that they were not stunts but actual animal cruelty done in the days before SPCA oversight.The father played by Chuck Connors is authoritarian. He never asks what happened in his absence he tells everyone. No one dares contradict him. He likes to grab his wife and kiss her unexpectedly and passionately reminiscent of a Siamese fighting fish. I detested him but he was a typical movie father for the era.The hero is what I took to be a 10 year old boy from his height later revealed in the dialogue to be 12 and played by a 15year old actor Luke Halpin. The boy Sandy is ridiculously docile by modern standards and obsequiously does whatever father wants without complaint. Sandy is still every boy's hero skilled brave outgoing strong handsome respected by the community trusted to run his own boat and fishing nets. Sandy has an erotic obsession with a male dolphin played by a female dolphin to help tone down the obviousness of the mutual arousal. His parents pretend not to notice pretending all that bumping and grinding is just cute.There are a few things that don't make sense in the movie. For the first half of the movie Sandy and an adoring younger girl whom he ignores are the only people his age in the vicinity. Then in one scene suddenly dozens of children appear and sing that idiotic King of the Sea song then disappear again. It is just totally out of place. The song belongs in some animated short for toddlers or in a commercial to sell inflatable dolphin toys.I was rather distressed by the tricks scene when they got Flipper to perform various fetch tricks treating him as if he were a dog. Dolphins have bigger brains than we do but you would never guess from that silly dog and pony show. They tossed an dachshund into the ocean with Flipper. To me the dog look panicked and could not get out of the enclosure and tried climbing on Flipper's back to avoid drowning. This was all treated as great fun.Sandy lives shirtless outdoors in the Florida sun on the ocean all day. Yet he never gets a sunburn or even a dark tan. Nobody ever reminds him to put on sun screen. I worried about the actor and whether making that film would have lead to skin cancer.".

The relationship between Flipper and Sandy was very sweet. The actor playing Sandy did a fine job as a fishing boy. The only problem I had with the film was with the characters killing dolphins. That made no sense as maritime superstition is that it is very bad luck to kill dolphins fishermen simply don't kill them. Dolphins are usually seen as good luck omens in fishing lore. Early on in the film Pa tells Sandy about a Greek myth about a dolphin saving the life of a poet. Fishermen have known for years that dolphins are good so the writing was very weak in this respect. When the boy shoots Flipper with a spear I was aghast. Most people know not to kill dolphins and have known for thousands of years. I liked Chuck Connors portrayal as Pa and the actress who plays Sandy's mother. I also liked the plot point of showing the family struggling during a season of red tide this was very authentic. Even with the inauthenticity of fishermen killing dolphins I think this is a fine family film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the Flipper TV series reruns as a kid unaware of this movie that effectively kicked the entire Flipper franchise off. I discovered the movies quite by accident on TCM and they were a pleasant surprise.The first Flipper movie seems to catch the simple but hurricane fraught life in the Florida Keys in the early 1960s. The movie portrays a more spartan and difficult life for the Ricks family and neighbors than the more placid and prosperous life on display in the NBC TV series. Porter Ricks is more austere played by Chuck Connors and a fisherman versus the warmer allAmerican Park Ranger character played by Brian Kelly in the sequel movie and the TV series. The first movie has a Mrs Ricks Kathleen McGuire who dies by the time of the sequel movie filmed one year later. Likewise in the Flipper movies there is only the one child  Sandy Luke Halpin and no younger brother whereas by the TV series the younger brother Bud Tommy Norden mysteriously appears. Luke Halpin is the only actor who played in both the Flipper movies AND the TV series a career as one character spanning 5 years.So setting aside the evolution of the Flipper franchise the first movie sets the scene for the enduring relationship between the dolphin and the boy. Seeing the movie after exposure to the TV series meant the first two thirds of the movie seemed to drag before we get to how Sandy came to have Flipper as his pet. Porter Rick's occupation as a fisherman plays a role in the plot as the finding then the fate of fish becomes intertwined with Flipper.The real draw card of this movie is how Flipper and Sandy become so bonded. Halpin is compelling as he persuades his gruff father to accept this bond. Luke Halpin was cast in the role of 12 year old Sandy Ricks at the age of 15 after 7 years of extensive TV and Broadway stage experience. Producer Ivan Tors was impressed by Halpin's acting history but was unsure if he was up to the intensive water related work the movie required. A quick trip to a YMCA pool near Halpin's Long Island NY home proved Halpin's claim of water sport proficiency. By all reports Halpin bonded quickly with the temperamental dolphins  a bond that Halpin described some 7 years later in a magazine interview that was so strong that both he and the dolphins would get homesick for each other after filming of a movie or TV series ended. The chemistry of this bond really makes this movie and overcomes the slow parts and the tendency of the story to drag.This Flipper movie carved an intriguing and popular niche that led to a sequel movie Flipper's New Adventure and then the popular TV series in quick succession. Tors was a master at underwater photography which was showcased by the move to full color. Halpin combined a depth of acting talent honed from many previous roles a real affinity and skill at water related sports a swimmer's physique and telegenic good looks with the chemistry with the dolphins. These factors along with the filming in the Florida Keys which lent a rough tropical realism to the story lines and the refining of underwater photography and the various trained moves of the dolphins laid the foundations for an endearing series that is still in syndication 50 years later. My younger kids and nephewsnieces really loved the movie so it still has a strong pull all these years later.".

You can sure prove it by what you see with this particular dolphin.Chuck Connors and Kathleen Maguire are the parents of Luke Halpin.

Making matters worse a hurricane appears as the film opens and Connors and Halpin have to beat it back to shore in the Florida Keys.They make it but the boat is severely damaged. While Connors looks to scrounge up work Luke saves the life of a stranded dolphin who is on the beach with a spear in him. Pretty soon he's teaching him all kinds of tricks but dolphins do eat a lot of fish and fish are scarce at this time.I think you can see where this is all going. Doesn't detract from the fact that Flipper became one of the most popular family films of all time spawning two more films and a four year run television series all with Luke Halpin. By the time Flipper got to TV Halpin had grown a bit and his voice changed. His father's profession had changed from fisherman to park ranger and he was played by Brian Kelly. He also lost his mother and gained a younger brother. And Halpin became a bubblegum teen idol of the first order.But for this original film the underwater photography was of Oscar type caliber and the acting chemistry between Halpin and the dolphin was good and unique. In fact some years ago I read that Halpin got the part for his swimming ability.After 50 years Flipper holds up quite well for family viewing.".
