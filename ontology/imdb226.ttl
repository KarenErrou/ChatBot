A gunship flies over Chuck after he has just destroyed a camp with his machine gun and sprays his area with bullets severely wounding his shooting arm. He tries to lift the gun up to shoot the chopper but alas his injury is too severe. A child freshly saved by Chuck runs to his aid from a bush and helps him lift the gun up.

Here Chuck discovers that his wife and son are still alive under Communist rule in Vietnam but the CIA is wary of letting him go there most likely because the last time they asked him to accompany them there he almost restarted the war. Chuck of course scoffs at this and leaves anyway Don't step on any toes Braddock. I don't step on toes Little JohnI STEP ON NECKS. For some reason upon his return to Saigon it turns out the Vietnamese military generals still want him dead for his war crimes. The same war crimes that had him imprisoned in a POW camp for 10 years! They just cannot let this go! By the series timeline this means that the Vietnamese government has been holding a grudge against this one particular guy for almost 20 years what did he do exactly? Raze a village?.Once a Colonel Quoc gets wind of Chuck's presence he ambushes Chuck shoots his wife and attempts to torture him and his son. Chuck escapes. This angers Quoc so much that he decides to kidnap about 40 random children out of spite. He takes the kids to a base and locks them up for God knows what purpose and one of his soldiers attempts to rape an 8yearold girl. Fortunately Chuck ambushes him and implants a bomb in his stomach and his entire body explodes right in front of the girl. Hats off to Chuck for saving her from a traumatizing experience. Then he completely wipes out the base in about fifteen minutes and packs all the kids into a truck for a quick getaway while being pursued by a helicopter. Here is the movie's only true dip in logic as the helicopter fires rockets at them and Chuck drives the truck through enormous flames multiple times and the kids inside are somehow not roasted alive. But that detail is a small price to pay for the levels of excitement throughout the movie. It has three times as much action as the previous installments and some convincing scenes of total chaos as well as Chuck doing somersaults through windows even though there are doors available all combining for a hearty 1010.

He flees along with the kids and harassing his enemies pursuers  escaping the innumerable risks and dangers .From the beginning to the end the comicbook actionpacked  transparent gore  and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement  for that reason the picture is pretty amusing though contains some perfunctory scenes . This is a routine actioner with Karate star Chuck Norris as the Vietnam veteran resulting to be one of the best roles he'd made to date  as he's fine as tough cold  obstinate Colonel Braddock . It's a predictable xenophobic  shallow and brainless film though will appeal to Chuck Norris enthusiasts because of it contains some excellent action sequences  when Braddock shoots with his machine gun  several explosions or scenes of motorboat and helicopters  . In the ink of  Uncommon courage  by Ted Kotcheff  and  RamboII  George Pan Cosmatos  with Norris attempting to imitate Silvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarnezzegger like one army man . The film is the best of the trilogy  the first entry deals with Braddock who schemes to free some American soldiers still held prisoners in a far prison camp into Vietnam . The second part  directed by Lance Hool  the first's producer  concerns about tortures and Braddock's suffering in prisoner camp . In the three movies there are some nasty  ominous villains well played by Asian players  James Hong  Soon Teck Oh and Aki Aelong who bear offensive racial stereotypes . Appropriate musical score by Jay Chattaway and adequate cinematography by cameraman Joao Fernandez  both of whom worked in the trilogy . The motion picture is produced in average budget by Cannon films  Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus  and professionally directed by Aaron Norris  Chuck's brother . It's a movie for frantic action lovers and warlike genre buffs. Rating  Acceptable passable and entertaining but violent . Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take  this moving film still has its fine moments getting a bemusing atmosphere with agreeable results  furthermore grossed lot of money at the box office along with the previous entries .".

It's got plenty of explosions and good action sequences however it is quite brainless so be sure to be in the mood. Most of the characters were cool and the finale was pretty good plus Chuck Norris is simply amazing in this!. It's a bit too routine at times however i couldn't help but fairly enjoy it as it's well paced and Aki Aleong is very menacing as the main villain plus it had a few shocking moments. Don't get me wrong i enjoyed it and Chuck was fantastic as usual it's just too routine to really work that well plus it was somewhat unpleasant at times. There is plenty of gunfire and action to keep one entertained for the most part and you care for the main charactersplus the ending was pretty good. This is a decent enough sequel that's nothing special but fairly entertaining if you put your brain in check worth the watch. The Direction is not bad. Aaron Norris does a decent job here with good camera work and angles and he kept the film at a good pace. There is a tiny bit of blood. We get a burnt corpse bloody wounds and some very bloody gunshot wounds. The Acting is very good. Chuck Norris AMAZING as always and is amazing here he is very likable intense vulnerable but seemed a little bored here at times still he was awesome! Norris Rules!. Aki Aleong is great as the main villain he was sadistic and very menacing. Roland Harrah III is okay as the son and did his job adequately. Miki Kim was good as the wife and did good in her screen time. Yehuda Efroni is decent as the Reverendand was fairly convincing. rest of the cast do okay. Overall Worth the watch. 12 out of 5".

Old Chuck thought she had died during the fall of Saigon. To make matters worse she has had his child! omg!! now Chuck is seriously annoyed and you better bet your ass he's gonna KILL EVERYONE!!.So as you might expect this film plays out pretty much like the original and sees Chuck going back into the jungles of Nam to kick ass. Of course as you might expect this being the third film its bigger louder a bit more impressive with stunts and explosions and ever so slightly more bloody...but not much oh and Chuck still won't swear. To add spice to this adventure old Chuck most endure the sight of his wife getting executed by the evil Vietnamese General not too soon after his initial rescue attempt. Holy wonton soup General! now you've REALLY done it! Chuck's gonna bite your nuts off whilst using polite profanity.Its probably the best of the trilogy for me because its just that bit grander yet still maintains those glorious 80's visuals and vibes that really set the stage for a retro offensive. Chuck is the epitome of the one man army he parachutes into Nam with his own personal speed boat loaded with gear treks through the jungle unaided and taking no malaria tablets finds the enemy base crashes it saves his wife and child and then promptly gets caught. But fear not! Chuck escapes after some mild torture gets his MASSIVE assault rifle heads back to the enemy base saves a whole tonne of other kids recently imprisoned and coolly dispatched all the bad guys in a superduper array of slow motion bullet hits and explosions.Its a serious film but at the same time its also a cheesy action flick. I could mention many things such as the fact none of the kids get injured at all during the main escape despite bullets shrapnel and debris raining down on them constantly but I won't. Of course as you may expect this being a Chuck flick there must be some douche bag US officials trying to stop his mission for political reasons so he can come across all rebellious and righteous. Well that box is totally checked.In short yes I know this hasn't been short the film is great fun in a tame Rambo type of way...but I'm sure you all expected that. Its Chuck at his best killing the bad guys being heroic and morally right in every way...hell its like watching 'Mary Poppins' with an assault rifle. Much more visually impressive and exciting than the first film not as serious and bleak as the second. It starts off seriously but soon descends into that familiar hokey action packed scenario where Chuck goes around snapping necks without breaking sweat. God Bless the Stars n Stripes emblazoned across Chuck's chest.810".

Colonel Braddock returns to Vietnam to find his family.There wasn't much originality to the story and it was very anticlimatic to experience what happened to the wife. Although it was also very predictable to be honest.And seeing Chuck Norris lead a group of mixed American and Vietnamese children around the jungle running from a mad Vietnamese officer hellbent on killing every last one of them was just a bit too trivial and wore thin quite fast.Part one of the Missing in Action movies was adequate and part two was actually good but part three is a losing battle that Braddock should never have been involved in.

	schema:reviewBody "Silly predictable action movie is definitely topical and does deliver for formula fans. It's got a tough as nails hero a story with some actual poignancy and villains we'll love to see get what they deserve. It's got enough bloody squib action various objects exploding into huge fireballs and striking Philippines scenery to make it a pretty good time for fans of the genre.Chuck Norris once again essays the role of former Vietnam war P.o.W. James Braddock who during the fall of Saigon tries to escape with his Vietnamese born wife Lin Tan Cang Miki Kim. But she's forced to stay behind when she loses her papers during the melee and Braddock is led to believe that she perished. 12 years later he learns that not only is she still alive but that they'd sired a son Van Roland Harrah III. Knowing full well that his government won't try to help him they even try to STOP him Braddock travels to Asia to retrieve his family and bring them home.This is NOT bottom of the barrel fare for the genre. It's certainly watchable with expert action scenes and stunts. Chucks' brother and sometime director Aaron Norris who'd been stunt coordinator on the first two flicks does alright. The movie written by James Bruner  Chuck himself has some real heart. Of course it might have even more if Chuck were more of an actor. But I digress. Chuck still reigns supreme as an ass kicker and it's never in any doubt that he'll rise up righteous and snuff out the lives of such despicable scum as the Vietnamese general Quoc Aki Aleong. Aleong is great fun especially as he spits out the heros' name after the latest amount of damage done. The supporting cast is decent if somewhat nondescript. However be sure to look for the eternally awesome Keith David in a small role as an Embassy gate captain.An entertaining diversion made in the mold of Uncommon Valor Rambo First Blood Part II...and Commando for that matter with a good guy who's an army unto himself.Seven out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Silly predictable action movie is definitely topical and does deliver for formula fans. It's got a tough as nails hero a story with some actual poignancy and villains we'll love to see get what they deserve. It's got enough bloody squib action various objects exploding into huge fireballs and striking Philippines scenery to make it a pretty good time for fans of the genre.Chuck Norris once again essays the role of former Vietnam war P.o.W. James Braddock who during the fall of Saigon tries to escape with his Vietnamese born wife Lin Tan Cang Miki Kim. But she's forced to stay behind when she loses her papers during the melee and Braddock is led to believe that she perished. 12 years later he learns that not only is she still alive but that they'd sired a son Van Roland Harrah III. Knowing full well that his government won't try to help him they even try to STOP him Braddock travels to Asia to retrieve his family and bring them home.This is NOT bottom of the barrel fare for the genre. It's certainly watchable with expert action scenes and stunts. Chucks' brother and sometime director Aaron Norris who'd been stunt coordinator on the first two flicks does alright. The movie written by James Bruner  Chuck himself has some real heart. Of course it might have even more if Chuck were more of an actor. But I digress. Chuck still reigns supreme as an ass kicker and it's never in any doubt that he'll rise up righteous and snuff out the lives of such despicable scum as the Vietnamese general Quoc Aki Aleong.

	schema:reviewBody "The final part of Chuck Norris' nobrainer Vietnam trilogy is a loud explosive and actionpacked adventure yarn to be embraced by genre fans. Yes the usual accusations of racism lack of characterisation and plot and gratuitous violence remain and in some cases are true this film yet those looking for mindless action and stuntwork will be well served by the fast pacing and thrillaminute nature of this movie. Action highlights include Chuck's sweaty escape from a Vietnamese prison a chase between a truck and a helicopter firing rockets and the scene in which Norris wades into the jungle prison camp and takes out the entire guard with the use of his handheld gatling gun  great stuff.Norris remains the muscular hero despite having visibly aged by this stage in his career and he handles the action with athleticism and skill. The supporting Vietnamese cast play clichd characters and are fairly unappealing. The plot is light and predictable enlivened by electric shock torture and a wonderful climax in which Norris is halfblown up by shrapnel and still manages to fight the bad guys off as he nears the bridge which borders Thailand. Yes it might be silly and unrealistic but the combination of colourful explosions martial arts combat heavy firepower and endless bad guys lining up to be killed make this entertainment at its most basic. Directed by Aaron Norris Chuck's brother who shrugs off accusations of nepotism by proving himself to be capable behind the camera.".

	schema:reviewBody "Braddock is back once again in this triumphant end to the trilogy. This time around Braddock Chuck of course is just trying to live life one day at a time after the end of the war. He's informed by a kindly priest Rev. Polanski Efroni that his wife Lin Kim who is Vietnamese is still alive there. After all these years he thought she was dead. So he travels back to 'Nam to reunite with her. He also finally sees his 12 year old son Van Harrah. Ruining the emotional moment there's yet another sadistic Vietnamese General Gen. Quoc Aleong. He hates Braddock  and also children  so Braddock has to not just get out of the country but bring an entire orphanage along with him! Can Braddock do it? To us this third and final installment in the Braddock trilogy is clearly the best. It's funnier looser weirder and has a different vibe from the previous two films. Possibly due to the fact that it was made three years after the second movie and this time it's directed by Aaron Norris. Because it honestly didn't really have to be made it has kind of an Eh screw it kind of vibe and they just threw everything at the wall to see what sticks. Luckily this approach is totally winning.Everything perhaps in spite of itself seems to work here Braddock showing his sensitive side the especially dark Prerequisite Torture the fact that Braddock's son calls him Braddock the fact that Gen. Quoc is constantly screaming Braddock!!!!! the Patton 1970like musical stings Braddock's awesomely awesome Supergun and many more excellent moments. All three movies had quality explosions and this one doesn't disappoint in the blowups department either. Matching that are some topnotch neck snaps as well. The whole movie is loaded with that classic 80's violencesillinesspatriotism mix that's the hallmark of the Golden Age of videostore action movies of the day. It's incredibly addictive once you get into them and since you're reading this site we assume you also have got the bug and we thank you.Besides all the on screen action some of the dialogue is priceless too. Most outstanding of course is the superquotable I don't step on toes...I step on necks line which Braddock actually lives up to later in the movie. The music by Ron Bloom and Lenny McDonald adds a lot and their Bruce SpringsteenmeetsWarren Zevon songs add another layer of icing for the wedding cake of radness that is Braddock. Also adding to the list of Braddock firsts this is the first of the three to be released on the Media label. You have to buy this movie on VHS for one very simple reason there is an amazing commercial on the tape for Braddock merchandise. You can get Braddock hats Tshirts and sweatshirts. This commercial alone makes the tape worth buying.We love this movie for some very personal reasons. It's the first Braddock movie we all saw and we rented it from our local video store back in the 90's. As a group of friends we watched the movie and two things of note happened we misheard the song lyrics in the beginning and we imagined the ultragruff vocalist sang In the streets of Saigon when my ass was king. So we continue to quote that plus you can't deny it's true in Chuck's case  we just thought the singer was being a bit on the nose to this day. And somehow another song was crafted. Sung to the tune of Don't Cry For Me Argentina came Don't cry for me Col. Braddock I know that you're missing in action. Thanks Ant. So clearly we have a strong personal connection to this fine film that you might not have. But that's the genius of Braddock. He inspires creativity. There may be a heavy metal CD in the works that's a concept album all about Braddock. It truly never ends.Nevertheless this the best of the Braddock movies represents a fine end to the trilogy. It's highly rare that sequels get BETTER as they go along yet the Braddock movies get absolutely no credit for bucking that trend. It might be the only trilogy in movie history to improve as it goes along but do you ever hear anyone say that? No of course not. So take a trip to the Philippines and watch Braddock work his magic one more time.".

	schema:headline " Probably the best Missing In Action entry for whatever that's worth";
	schema:reviewBody "By combining the topical bent that remained a constant thread throughout the Missing In Action series with increased firepower and nearly unceasing action this final segment of the trilogy may very well be the strongest of the bunch.The story deviates slightly from the POW focus found in the first two Missing In Action entries and Braddock's impetus this time is his learning that the wife he thought was dead and the son he didn't know he had are sequestered within hostile territory in Vietnam. After being dismissed by interloping and incompetent CIA brass Chuck designates himself a oneman infiltration squad and returns to the wartorn land to bring his family home.The nefarious General Quoc proves to be Braddock's most sadistic nemesis yet and when our oftabused hero's wife is murdered his mission turns into a quest for vengeance. Captured by Quoc Braddock and his son are subjected to a particularly harrowing bit of combined torture before escaping the enemy stockade soon after which Chuck's son is caught yet again thus setting the stage for Braddock's return to free his boy and launch the explosive bloodbath implied by the MIA moniker.Though ample time is spent developing the story this installment of the franchise packs more action into the proceedings than either of the two films before it. The body count is likewise elevated and Chuck spends a good chunk of the movie mowing down anyone wearing a Vietnamese military uniform with a variety of weapons. By far the coolest of the lot is a tribarrelled assault rife that houses a machine gun a revolving grenade launcher and a nastylooking bayonet all used to great effect in a scene which features a wouldbe rapist being knifed in the chest and having an explosive canister burrowed into his guts. MIA3 is easily the goriest of the series and the squibhappy special effects team seems to relish the opportunity to make every bullet hit explode toward the camera.As you'd expect there's also plenty of the requisite silliness that goes hand in hand with the likeminded genre films of the era. My favorite turn of events revolves around a group of orphaned AmerAsian children Norris rescues who in the brief span of time they're in Braddock's presence get imprisoned in a military installation see dozens of their countrymen being violently slaughtered are repeatedly shot at with machine guns become involved in a precarious truck chase with missiles from a pursuing helicopter detonating all around them and are forced to march miles through the Vietnamese jungles without food or water before Chuck finally loads the lot of them into a airplane... which he promptly crash lands.Despite some of the goofier moments Chuck I don't step on toes... I step on necks MIA3 carries a fairly serious tone throughout and much as the previous films drove home the realworld plight of American soldiers abandoned by their country during the conflict in Vietnam Braddock sheds a little light on the civilian casualties of that dreadful war. The opening sequence in particular set during the chaos amidst the fall of Saigon features powerful images that wouldn't be out of place in one of the Oscarready portrayals of the Vietnam War fallout released during this same period. It certainly helps that the production values here are the highest of the series and in that respect Braddock has aged better than its two predecessors although the two cloying Journey copycat tunes that bookend the film definitely have not.General Quoc's final comeuppance isn't quite as impactive as it could be but the film's closing moments provide a fitting conclusion to the story and the series. General Braddock has ostensibly retired I'm guessing that if Chuck had any interest in doing a Missing In Action 4 it would have happened by now but the character's fairly shortlived screen presence proved to be a consistently entertaining sector of the '80s Baction canon. Even if Chuck Norris hadn't done roughly 400 other lowbudget action movies like Braddock Missing In Action III I'd like to think that his legacy would be secured by the notunsubstantial merits of this outing alone.".

There was probably has a little more story hanging off it than say its first sequel The Beginning. But it feels like its rehashing ideas from the first two while adding its own angle involving American  Asian orphans. Nonetheless it's just as thick with its overwrought propaganda push and bgrade dialogues with the quicklipped oneliners. Director Aaron Norris conventionally lays it out. Keeping a brisk pace even with some blotchy action it's surprisingly lean sweaty and fistpumping. I wasn't expecting it to be as sadistic as it was as I remembered seeing bits and pieces of it thinking it was rather toned down compared to the other films in the series. But it's just as raw and brutal. The performances fall on the static side. Chuck Norris gives a weathered acting performance but still effectively breaks out those lethal head hugs and neck snapping. After showing glimpses throughout he finally lets loose in the dying stages by breaking out the big guns. Aki Aleong is vivid but gets a bit overthetop as the merciless Vietnamese General who'll do anything to see Braddock admit to the crimes towards his country. Also you got the likes of Jack Rader Floyd Levine and a tiny showin by Keith David.".

Norris encounters another evil general as he did in the previous film who also has a penchant for torture. By the film's end Norris saves an entire orphanage of Amerasian kids from the general and his cronies. The first half hour of the film is filled with a lot of unnecessary exposition before things get going. The middle third of the film is probably the best and most enjoyable because it's more realistic and tensionfilled than the last third. The last half hour once again reduces all tension and action to a comic book level with Norris turning into a one man army yet again he fires weapons snaps necks and uses enough kicks to run a martial arts class. Unlike previous films of his Norris only yields one great line of dialog. Remember he doesn't step on toes he steps on necks. It's probably slightly below average for a Chuck Norris film. 12 of 4 stars.".

For my comment to actors Aki Aleong's General Quoc was another heinous villain in my feeling. I believe many watcher want him to die quickly due to his cruel act even Braddock or Van. Chuck Norris still show his character less talk more fight but his John Braddock's role should had more feeling with his son. Even Roland Harrah III did his good job as Van Tan Chang but the plot made Van show his love to his dad in a very short time probably last 10 minutes which ran so quickly. The plot should made the father and son talking more. Please remember both of them didn't face each other for 12 years!!! In my opinion this movie has a good action but imperfect drama. This movie has similar plot to the first Missing in Action except the people who receive help by Braddock was now the American orphan children. also Braddock's unexpected family as well Althrough the movie use many cruel scenes to shake watcher's conscience and make sympathy to good guys in the movie. I accepted that General Quoc's death in this movie was the same as many Cannon Film's movie which the main villain usually dead in easily way make me unsatisfied with it. due to I hate the character that show ruthlessness to women or children However without bias or some own feeling I can admit this movie.".

	schema:headline " One of the alltime funniest films.";
	schema:reviewBody "The sequence in this film where Danny Kaye lands on the stage of an balletic opera in progress has got to rank up there with the funniest single scenes in motion picture history. The spoof is as spoton as the Fantasia spoof of opera in the Dance of the Hours sequence. It's hard to explain how the previous reviewer thought the newcarwithgadgets scene was the funniest actually it's the most dated and Knock on Wood would be better off without it. The story is a wicked satire on espionage agents with Danny caught up unawares in the center of an international spy ring. There's also a love story reminiscent of Walter Mitty but this is the funnier film of the two. Danny Kaye is one of the most underrated actors of all time. His facial expressionsconveying what he thinks which is often opposite to what he or the other characters are sayingis like a second voice carrying the humor line. It's so well done that it seems mundane to people who are not on the lookout for it. Only Sid Caesar of all the comics in American history including Chaplin and the other silent greats used his facial expressions to the supreme comic effect that Danny Kaye achieved. I might even rank Caesar above Kay but unfortunately Caesar did not get any good movie roles. Mel Brooks wanted him for The Producers and it would have become THE best comedy of all time if he had landed him but some busybody associate producer hated Caesar and so he nixed the deal. How sad. If I were pressed to choose among Danny Kaye's films I guess I would choose The Court Jester above Knock on Wood in terms of allround satisfaction. Yet the ballet spoof in Knock on Wood surpasses any single scene in The Court Jester. If you never see it you'll never know how funny a thing can be.".

	schema:headline " Another riotous Danny Kaye film";
	schema:reviewBody "Danny Kaye made only 17 big screen movies and six TV movies in his 50year career. He was surely in demand to do more. But like other manytalented physical performers i.e. Fred Astaire Kaye took time to perfect his often complicated routines. And his films were mostly in his first 30 years. He had his own highly popular TV series that ran over five years 19631967 and he made guest appearances on other shows. Kaye was one of the few multitalented performers on stage and the silver screen and I think he was one of the best. He was primarily known as a comedian. But he was an excellent dancer and singer as well. He was a firstrate mimic. He had a versatile voice and could imitate various ethnic voices. And he was the singular master of tonguetwisters. His rapidfire tonguetwister monologues and songs were marvelous to see and hear. About the middle of his career Kaye made Knock on Wood. He plays a ventriloquist Jerry Morgan who unwittingly gets involved in an espionage caper between Paris and London. Kaye sings dances tonguetwists and ruses his way through many a scrape in this delightful comedy. He has his usual slapstick situations and is riotous in a ballet sequence. When three bodies turn up in his hotel rooms he becomes known in London as the redheaded ripper. Two of the most hilarious escapades are his posing as an English gentleman and then as an Irishman at a Sons of Hibernia convention. His tonguetwister song in brogue is over the top funny. Danny Kaye played a couple of serious roles in films but mostly was an entertainer who relished making people laugh. Kaye never won an Oscar but was given an honorary Academy Award for his exceptional talents and service to filmdom and America. He was just 44 when he received that award in 1955. He did win two Golden Globes  for On the Riviera in 1952 and Me and the Colonel in 1958. And he won an Emmy for his TV comedy series. In 1982 he received another award from the Hollywood academy  the Jean Herscholt Humanitarian Award. For many years Kaye was ambassador at large for the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF and the organization asked him to accept the 1955 Nobel Peace Prize it was awarded. Kaye is probably most known today for his costarring role with Bing Crosby in White Christmas. In 1955 he was near the end of his roles with much physical activity and he focused more on music. He played Red Nichols in that music man's 1959 biopic The Five Pennies. Kaye toured with Bob Hope shows for American service men overseas. Hope said Kaye was his favorite comedian.Whatever Danny Kaye was in was worth watching. Kaye said that he was born to entertain people. All of his comedy films are among the best of the genre. The inimitable Danny Kaye shines in this wonderful comedy as he does in all the others. It's pure joyful and fun entertainment for the whole family.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've come to the belief that Danny Kaye is an acquired taste his early films quite funny yet some of the themes going way overboard to be over the heads of adolescents. His pairing with wife Sylvia Fine was a teaming of one of the great satirist writers and portrayer of those type of parts. In this very upscale comedy spoof of spy movies he shows his meddle as he goes back into the territory of his early 1940's Broadway hit Lady in the Dark as he goes into therapy to discover the reasons why he has allowed his romantic pairings to be destroyed by his ventriloquist dummy. Psycho analyst Mai Zetterling seems to have ulterior motives for taking his case possibly being involved in the spy ring that hid secret documents in his dummy.A serious atmosphere takes this way above the typical Bob Hope spy vehicle. There's no time for nonsense and other than the occasional patter song this is more plot oriented than normal making it frequently suspenseful as well as ironic in its underplayed humor. Kaye provides a variety of accents making it obvious as to why he was one of the most popular comics among adults and children who would have to see this again on T.V. later on to further understand it. Ironically released the same year as Hus big Paramount musical White Christmas opposite Bing Crosby he had the honor of sharing with Bing two quite different performances other than that overrated Christmas perennial. Bing nominated for an Oscar for The Country Girl is equally matched by Danny in this. The intelligent story got an Oscar nomination and Kaye certainly ranks as among the best performances of 1954.".

I am sure that it took a few takes to get it right. The second is when Danny is trying to hide from both the police and spies and gets mixed up in a Russian ballet troupe performing on stage.

But so does law enforcement in several countries.Knock On Wood is not as good as so many of Kaye's films still his fans should like it. Best is the ballet sequences where in trying to elude the police who want him for a homicide and the spies who just want him dead Danny fouls up a ballet that his former girlfriend is starring in. What a way to put a coda on a breakup. Of course Danny was to reach the height of his career with his next two films White Christmas and The Court Jester.

It's a very pleasant and lovely and romantic film done with a good sense of humour with wonderful leading actors the best of the three Spessartseries from my point of view  a mixture of adventure and a trueGermanSpirit fairytale a film that will put you in high spirits and lovely mood The best of the three I promise you!".

And I just recently saw it again for the second time  and still enjoyed it very much  I had such a pleasant feeling all the troubles seemed to be blown away. It's a very pleasant and lovely and romantic film done with a good sense of humour with wonderful leading actors the best of the three Spessartseries from my point of view  a mixture of adventure and a trueGermanSpirit fairytale a film that will put you in high spirits and lovely mood The best of the three I promise you!";

The story drags you in right aways and is told in a fast pace held together by good camera work and jump edits. The colours have this irresistable look of 50s german cinema with colours brighter then reality especially in the brand new digitalised version I saw looks fresh after all these decades. Some of the jokes work even 60 years later such a silly feel goodhumour it catches you by surprise at times because as a modern viewer you're not used to it anymore  but refreshed each time. The love story is corny to a likable degree. The songs are rare short and memorable which makes them enhance the story instead of interrupting it. The acting is what you'd expect  in the best way possible.If you get a chance to see this at the movies or on a lazy afternoon zapping  catch it. Won't change your life but guaranteed to give a good time!".

With their true morals restored they end up condemning the gangsters who ran the regime.Despite these serious moral issues the film has a lightness and charm reinforced by delightful musical numbers and slapstick that make the message all the more palatable. This is also a return to a more innocent age where villains can be outthought and outcharmed and a nostalgic view of a Germanic fiefdom long before the troubles brought about by the Second and Third Reichs.

	schema:reviewBody "Das Wirtshaus im Spessart or The Spessart Inn is a West German color film from 1958 so it will have its 60th birthday soon. And it should not be taken for granted as there are many German films from the 1960s that are still in blackandwhite. And maybe this use of color is one reason why this this slightly under 100minute movie is still somewhat known today more than most other 1950s films for sure. And another reason may be that this is just the beginning from a whole series of Spessart films. However I myself must say that this one would have been enough. It was not a failure and there were no really bad moments in here but as a whole I found it fairly forgettable and it did not have enough fascinating scenes and interesting moments. The director is Kurt Hoffmann and returned for future films as well. The entire film is based on a fairytale by Wilhelm Hauff a writer from the early 19th century who died at a very young age but still wrote some pieces that are still known today. His stories are usually darker but this one here really isn't. Yes there is a story about an abducted girl but it is really all about the comedy romance and music. Sadly in these areas it does not stand out compared to all the mediocrity Germany delivered in the 1950s. That's why I give it a thumbsdown. Lead actress Lilo Pulver could not win me over either. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was raised as a JW. I am no longer practicing but understand why many do. I would like to comment on the woman who said she was a JW and worked in the medical field. She posted something on this site. She was discussing the problems with accepting blood transfusions. She said that after 26 years she'd seen those that refused transfusions make it through whatever medical crisis they were going through and to live. I agree that there are many problems that can arise from accepting a blood transfusion and I personally have chosen not to accept blood.However I think that it is wrong to spread the message that there are those that don't accept blood will still live. Some JW's actually think that if their faith is strong enough that they will make it through. This is simply not the case. It just depends on how things happen.When I was a child there was a brother in my parent's congregation who had seven children. He wanted to have more but his wife's doctor told him that this would be detrimental to his wife's health. They did not listen and she got pregnant one more time. The baby was born and the wife started to hemorrhage. The brother really thought that if his faith was strong enough that she wouldn't die. He felt that by refusing blood he would make Jehovah happy. I think he felt that this would guarantee her survival. He was wrong. But he should have been satisfied to know that his wife's wishes were followed and they were following Jehovah's commandments.While I agree with the idea that accepting blood is wrong I don't think we should fool ourselves into thinking that we are all going to still survive after this. It simply doesn't work that way.".

Who is spreading this message? I ask because I have not seen such a message. Is there rightly a message that avoiding blood has many benefits and as such it actually increases your chances of survival? Well as a Jehovah's Witness I can tell you that there are DOCTORS who have told us that. When Jehovah's Witnesses talk to people it is not common for them to bring blood up in a conversation. Rather it is usually other people who do. I always say that I have no right to insist that they should not have a blood transfusion that is between you and your Doctor. On the other hand I also point out that it would be equally wrong then to tell people like me that I MUST have a blood transfusion. It is indeed a very personal matter between you the Doctor your family and what you would never put last on the list your relationship with God the Father who gives us all life. Does that then make us fanatics? I don't think so no more than those who went to war believing they were fighting for a just cause and willing to die yes they will even say for freedom. Do they not also understand that we are also willing likewise. Not that anybody wants to die no sane person would. But when God is a real person to you then we should be free and have freedom as well to obey for a higher cause. Just think of all those American bodies on Omaha Beach. To many they died for something  it was for what the believed in. Nobody thinks they wanted to die. The same goes for Jehovah's Witnesses forcing them to have blood is taking away something they cherish and it is also about freedom. Nobody would want to live and be enslaved at the same time. But here is the flip side that God says we will prosper if we do abstain from blood Acts 15 that God is not a liar and that the disciple Luke who wrote Acts was actually a physician? Yes several books of the Bible was written by a DOCTOR. May be a coincidence perhaps but interesting nonetheless. Avoiding blood has been a blessing  and the benefits hugely outnumbers the negatives which are actually hard to number at all. My Mother was told she would die in her 30's if she did not have a blood transfusion and an abortion. She got a better Doctor who did care and did not panic. My kid brother was not aborted but has kids of his own. My Mother? She is now 82. I love the last moments of Knocking  the part where the Jew JW that alone sounds funny on the carousel with that wonderful expression on his face. Priceless.".

Once in awhile with the help of the kids manages to extract money from the landlord next door who keeps trying to sell his plot. But the prospective buyers always run away when they hear the noise made by the children.

So our Brahmachari brings her back promising to transform her into the kind of beauty rich playboy Pran would fall in love with.What happens when brahmachari realizes he has fallen in love for the first time? Will he let her go to rich playboy? What happens when he realizes that he has to choose between his love and his children? Watch to see what happens.Review Brahmachari is thoroughly entertaining movie with all the necessary ingredients laughs drama romance and fighting. The kids are a riot to watch. The best scene in the movie is when one of the kids does an impression of mehmood in the classic song by mukesh Hum kale hai to kya hua dilwale hai. The music is also wonderful. The most notable being the immensly popular Aaj Kal Tere Mere Pyar ke Charche as well as the touching Main gaaon tum so jaao. Rajshree doesn't have too much to do in the film but is decent. Pran is well Pran reliably evil as always. Mumtaz is good. The movie is Shammir Kapoor all the way. Giving the best performances of his career he got the best actor award for this film.In conclusion Brahmachari is wonderful movie for the whole family. Definately recommended especially for the Aaj kal tere mere pyar song and Shammi Kapoor's performance.".

It's very dated and even tame by today's standards but it's entertainment value remains second to none.Olsen  Johnson's zany Broadway stage show gets a Hollywood reworking i.e completely different from the stage show. They play two bumbling stage hands hired to do the props for Robert Paige's outdoor theatre show. but decide to sabotage the proceedings when they wrongly assume that the girl Paige has fallen in love with Jane Frazee is not of righteous virtue bit of a maneater. Their reasoning being if the show's a flop then he won't be able to marry the gal thus saving him from scandal and misery.The Jokes come thick and fast with virtually every other line to the point where you fail to think of another comedy film where the gags are so 'rapid fire'. Even if you sneeze you'll probably miss ten gags such is the movie's joke density.Great support comes from Martha Raye who's given a few great songs to belt out such as What Kind of Love is This and Watch The Birdy and she works well with the wonderful Mischa Auer as the object of her unreturned affections.Clarence Kolb does what he does best playing the short tempered old fuddy duddy. Hugh Herbert too gives us a few great scenes though his character is the only one in the movie that has no real purpose so much so that movie would not have suffered had he not been there.Robert Paige and Jane Frazee play the love interests and share a few well performed songs Universal not generally remembered for their musicals probably thought that they had found their John Payne and Alice Faye.Hellzapoppin' is probably also one of the first films to 'break the 4th wall' with dialogue constantly being directed to the movie audience. Even to the projectionist who is fleshed out in the form of 'The forgotten Stooge' Shemp Howard.The show itself is 15 odd minutes of pure gutwrenchingly funny stuff. The ruination of Auer's  Raye's Ballet The Robert E Lee number and the 'sneezing guy'. I never thought sneezing could be that funny until I saw this movie.Throw in Richard Lane as the frustrated Film Director and Elisha Cook Jnr as the meek scriptwriter then you have a great family laughfest of a movie.This type of zany musical Comedy had been around for many years on the stage and in Vaudeville and on the club circuit but had hardly been seen on the movie screen until Olsen  Johnson opened everybody's eyes. It certainly paved the way for other zany comics of the same type of humour to get into movies like Danny Kaye and Dean Martin  Jerry Lewis. Having said all that Hellzapoppin' is not only a hysterical movie in it's own right but in a way a milestone too.I loved Hellzapoppin' and I'm not ashamed to admit it either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on Olsen and Johnson's long running Broadway show this film is probably only a shadow of its source which changed from night to night as material was adlibbed and current events were made fun of. On stage the show had an anything can happen feel that is nicely mirrored in the opening scenes as Olsen and Johnson throw everything you can think of at the audience in a rapid fire sequence of gags about the making of the Hellzapoppin movie. Not all of them are apparent with many being purely visual and in the background. After about 15 minutes of uncontrolled madness the film settles down as Olsen and Johnson go off to an estate to put on a show. Here the rapid fire nature slows a bit as the film is forced to conform to a plot however its still just as funny as characters wander in and out creating an ever changing sense of madness.I admit thats a poor description of the film but how to you describe chaos? You can't you have to experience it and anyone who loves great movies and great comedy really should see this movie. Its pure mindless fun that will keep you laughing from start to finish. This is the best Olsen and Johnson film that I've seen. While it could be argued that some of the gags in Crazy House are funnier Hellzapoppin holds all of the insanity and the occasional musical numbers together better In Crazy House the madness stops for each song here the insanity keeps right on going. If you see one Olsen and Johnson film in your life this should be it.A film to be searched out and watched repeatedly Hellazapoppin is one of the greatest comedies ever made. now if someone would be smart enough to put this out on DVD in the US more people could enjoy it".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay first let's dispatch this old nag  HELLZAPOPPIN' is NOT the stage play transferred to film. The 1938 show was a revue. A series of sketches blackouts and musical numbers. Richard Lane as the director was right  This is Hollywood we change everything! And in my humble opinion I think they did a darn fine job. The love story was merely a vehicle for a couple of very nice songs the entire score is firstrate and a goofy performance by the longforgotten Lewis Howard. Jane Frazee and Robert Paige were both top drawer light players at Universal with excellent singing voices. So believe me in making the necessary changes Universal gave it their best shot. As for the fun stuff it's simply nonstop from Shemp Howard and Jody Gilbert in the projection booth to former Stooge Fred Sanborn playing tictactoe on a horse's backside to the singing and dancing devils with chicks on a spit! to Mischa Auer doing his very best schnorrer routine to the otherworldly Hugh Herbert hello ma I'll be home for dinner  have meat! to the myriad gags that break the fourth wall to the eyepopping and breathless turn by Martha Raye to the greatest Lindy Hop number committed to film and on and on. If you roll your eyeballs at corny gags this picture ain't for you! But if you revel at the shear audacity of pulling off such corn with absolutely no shame whatsoever then you want to experience HELLZAPOPPIN'. If at all possible see it with an audience. No comedy can be fully appreciated by solo viewing. But as laughter is infectious the kinetic energy generated by this picture really cries out for a communal experience. One aspect of this picture is seldom mentioned and that is the musical direction. Universal was really tops in the early 40's of putting pop sounds in their B musicals. Well this is definitely an 'A' picture and Charlie Previn's orchestra is in fine form especially in the Congaroo number. By the way  it has long been my contention that HELLZAPOPPIN' was not at least completely directed by the credited H. C. Potter. The style of the film is unlike anything else Potter did and is completely akin to the work of Eddie Cline who was Universal's ace comedy director at the time and who directed the next three Olsen  Johnson features. Just a theory of mine and one for which I have absolutely no documentation or other type of support. HELLZAPOPPIN' has been buried in the US since 1966 when the rights reverted to the Nederlander Organization. But fortunately a UK DVD from Universal's 35mmm fine grain has been released and is a superb video version of the film. It is also shown occasionally on TV in Canada. Now  will someone PLEASE stop that woman from yelling Oscar!!".

But fortunately a UK DVD from Universal's 35mmm fine grain has been released and is a superb video version of the film. It is also shown occasionally on TV in Canada. Now  will someone PLEASE stop that woman from yelling Oscar!!";

Hollywood demanded a plot. So Olsen  Johnson tell the audience upfront that they are adding a plot...a love story...even though they really don't want one. They do get their revenge on Hollywood in the end however by shooting the writer.I admit the plot is the least interesting part of the film. The marvel of this 1941 film is the breaking of the fourth wall. The actors talk to both the audience and the projectionist played by Shemp Howard of Three Stooges fame. Enjoyable? The jokes are corny. The music is 1940. Still the pure subversion of standard cinematic conventions turns a standard 1941 musical comedy into a classic of what can happen in film when you think outside the box. Funny. Ridiculous. Pure lunacy. You owe it to yourself to see Hellzapoppin' at least once.".

By the time I'd seen Kane Double Indemnity even Deliverance Apocalypse Now etc I'd realised it wasn't so simple. Or is it? Which single film would you want to have and be able to watch on a uninhabited desert island  potentially over and over again? This is the one for me! I've now seen it maybe 20 times I can't laugh like a drain continuously at slapstick anymore but there's always something in Hellzapoppin' to amuse me  which I always need more of than darkly serious brainsnappers.It's the original template crazy comedy which manages to squeeze the Hollywood condition in there must be a story with romance and slushy songs. Fortunately it was wellmade with the high production values and that special early 40's cleverly lit studiobound atmosphere that Universal seemed to achieve so easily. Don Raye and Gene de Paul were on top form with the songs they wrote for this and all were pleasantly well sung my particular favourite being the full blown You were there. Nobody but Olsen  Johnson would have done as well for the main roles  it was their show after all but everyone in the film version was good and they and their lines and actions are all there safely printed in my mind.The shots of Paige and OJ sneakpeeking the wonderful Slim Gaillard and then the Harlem Congeroos will probably enrage nonmusical pc people but that's their problem. It was dated the first time time I saw it  it remains the same a 40's time capsule. While films made in the 80's and 90's start to look even more dated without mobile phones computers or cgi for even the most trivial effect how would Spielberg do E.T. now I wonder? I taped it off UK Channel 4 on Christmas Day afternoon 1986  the adverts in between are so dated and cringeworthy by comparison now!".

Toward the end of the movie there's a bear in the tree. Someone takes a shot at it and the bear remarks Ha ha you missed mea nearby dog then says Imagine that a talking bear. I haven't seen the film since that night in my room so long ago. I'm looking forward to locating a copy for purchase soon. Lots of fun...Mike";

If you don't know much about the 1940s or movies of that time then this will be mystifying. Assuming you are so credentialed then you can enjoy this wacky outing for what it is just plain madness. Olsen and Johnson are almost completely forgotten nowadays but they were big stars on Broadway where this originated in some racier form. Bringing the vehicle to film required changing some of the gags but it all works quite well. It helps if you enjoy Martha Raye some may find her performances over the top but that was her style and audiences of the time seemed to enjoy her. It's all a matter of taste of course but I find this OJ film less dated than much of the Marx Brothers' work. This used to be shown on TV but now it seems to be out of circulation. Let's hope the legal hassles will be resolved and this  and a few other overlooked gems  will be released to home video soon!".

It's also an image of the struggles of friendship. Both I and my wife talked long about the movie after seeing it discussing who of the characters most corresponded to ourselves as youngsters how we wish we hadn't been and how hard it is for adults to really understand their kids. The movie left us with the hope that we won't treat our kids the same way when they reach the critical age that WE would be able to listen without prejudice and keep an open mind. This movie is a mustsee for all teenagers and their parents but not together. Teenagers separate their parents separate. And make sure you have time for a long discussion afterwards  it's worth it.A good solid movie with HUGE young talent in the leading roles.It's even more unsettling when you think that writerdirector Fabik has based events on her own experiences.

During the party she hooks with a guy and becomes way too drunk it all ends up in her collapsing on the floor and the 9th grade guys start taking pictures of her. The pictures spread through the school like a fire and she becomes a slut in the eyes of many students.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a generally enjoyable film funny quite romantic and socially relevant too. It's great that this movie is objective at addressing the problem of a mislead group of adolescents and definitely does not generalize all teenagers as shallow or wild. And it's certainly not your typical Hollywood teen movie where it all gravitates around some dancewinter ballprom at the end.I certainly enjoyed this film and there were many funny scenes watch out for the ketchup scene and relevant themes.However there was a little bit of inconsistency with the plot and just some minor problems. SPOILERS might be ahead... Like how Sebbe said that Mouse was having some family problems that's why he was cruel to some of his peers why didn't they explore that further to resolve the issue between him and Sofie? And even though it was made to understand that Sofie was being discriminated in school for being like a slutwhore it seemed like it was only Mouse's and Beatrice's group of friends who insulted and made fun of Sofie. The feeling of being discriminated by the whole school wasn't exactly there because it was the same people who terrorized Sofie. The film did succeed however in portraying her all alone and betrayed by her friends. ENDI recommend that if you plan on watching this look at the other comments for this movie to get an objective view of whether you should watch it or not. But all in all you should just watch it for yourself and judge whether your money was worth it or not ".

I certainly didn't but this is exactly the case with Peter Jackson who then brought this extremely bizarre comedyhorror splatterfest called BRAINDEAD also known as DEADALIVE and between 1999 and 2003 cemented his status with the ubiquitous monumental LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY.A simple premise that had by then done numerous times  flesheating zombies wreck havoc among the living  is taken not only to the ultimate extreme here it just makes going over the top seem like a weak clich. It completely jumps straight over a cliff and never bothers to return to any sense of normalcy. That this story of zombies gone amok has been dressed with an interesting Freudian spin  over possessive mother tries to control her son's every move even after undead quite like PSYCHO  only makes the hero's evolution from Mama's boy to unlikely survivor ever the stronger and gives the completely lurid tale some grounding even after it explodes left and right literally in pieces of flesh and still moving body parts.DEAD ALIVE has a lot to owe to EVIL DEAD 2 DEAD BY DAWN with its gleeful amounts of gore and truly slapstick scenes of crazy body parts but it outdoes it by the sheer volume of gore and blood that comes forth once the real madness begins. The fact that the aforementioned body parts have a will of their own makes for one riproaring sight gag after another in frenetic shots  for example one character's body snaps in two his lower torso continues to amble about his inner organs come ripped apart from his body and even take a peek at a mirror to see how they look while the owner's upper torso gets partially flushed down a toilet. As a matter of fact that same character's intestines take up quite a lot of screen time towards the climax as they chase the apparently hapless Timothy Balme around the house as his girlfriend battling zombies in the kitchen uses a blender to grind a hand that simultaneously tries to pull her in and all the while a baby zombie is becomes something of a tennis ball bouncing about while creating yes even more havoc. That is until Balme goes berserk with a lawnmower and makes puree out of the entire lot of them. All this shows to what extremes the notion of the exaggeration of horror could be taken the more blood and outrageousness the less horrifying it becomes and here once it starts it never lets up until its sidesplitting finale.Definitely not for all tastes but for people who like their horror with a nice dose of Tex Avery lunacy comedy as black as night and tanks of the red stuff  this is horror comedy par excellence.".

For a film with a miniscule budget approximately 3 million he makes every penny count and turns out a very nice looking film. The comedy is pure slapstick and at times dark as pitch.

The story is pretty simple but includes some ingenious plot elements  such as a budding romance between two very likable characters Balme and Penalver a psychologically distressing relationship between Balme and his mother and well scripted dialog.Balme plays Lionel  a troubled more or less housebound young man who has been forced to spend most of his time taking care of a domineering and psychologically damaging elderly mother. Penalver plays Paquita  his romantic destiny. Paquita is a charming young woman for whom English is perhaps a second language. Soon after they meet Paquita notices some odd quirks in Lionel's behavior and slowly begins to realize that there is something besides the usual male fear of commitment. Perhaps Lionel's cannibalistic zombie mother is to blame? Soon enough Balme is babysitting a whole family of living dead who he has to constantly inject with animal tranquilizers and trying to fend off a despicable uncle who is trying to muscle in on his inheritance. Then the fun really starts. It's the Dead Alive Series with extra gore infused with brilliant slapstick and just a pinch of Monty Python.Balme is amazing!  an excellent physical actor with great slapstick pacing and manic anxiety. And Penalver is delightfully pretty and sincere yet gives a nice campy performance. Dead Alive is one of the films in which Jackson began to blend detailed ecstatic and fantastic elements into his plots and cinematography  later culminating in the disturbing Heavenly Creatures and the spectacular LOTR trilogy. In Dead Alive he finds his formula and makes it work without a tremendous budget. The film is well shot and grotesque but remarkably amusing.".

There are so many spectacularly creative deaths in this movie and scenes of pure blood splatter that no other horror movie will inflict a severe gross out effect on you again.  I'm serious too I saw this movie in '94 and I've still yet to see anything this awesome.  I've heard there are some pretty cool Japanese movies like Lai Wong and Versus was really good though not as gross as DA.  Of course if you really need to see something off the charts watch Urotsukidoji.  It doesn't matter which one I'm sure they're all nuts.  Back to Dead Alive at first the movie is really iffy though the gore is still present but then it just starts to roll.  Greating acting by Timothy Balme as well!  Just watch it and love it!

	schema:headline " The twisted world of Sir Peter Jackson";
	schema:reviewBody "'Braindead' as the name suggests is a zombie film. But wait! This doesn't make it like any other zombie film. In fact this is the powerhouse of a splatter! As a gatekeeper of the cinema hall I request all the haters of gore go home and welcome all those who love the twisted tale of splatter and walking innards that set history in the world of splatter. People had seen gore before 'Braindead' was released but what sets this one apart from the other gore films is that 'Braindead' falls into the 'comedy horror' genre. Since it's no disturbing stuff the lovers of splatter may revel this twisted tale for years together.The film begins with the scene of Skull Island where we come across a New Zealand zooofficer Bill Ralston who has dared catch a Sumatran Monkey with the help of local guides and poachers. The spearwielding tribal inhabitants show unwelcoming attitude towards the intruders and follow them. Fortunately they happen to take the monkey along but the zooofficer gets bitten. The poachers lose no time in decapitating and beheading the helpless zooofficer for his sole good for they fear that the monkey's bite would transform him into something bizarre! The monkey reaches Wellington and is kept in a zoo.Cut to Wellington we meet a young man Lionel Cosgrove Timothy Balme who lives with his overpossessive domineering and snobbish mother Vera Elizabeth Moody. Vera loves making Lionel work for hours together and keeps him engaged in several odd jobs. It so happens that Lionel begins his first affair with a dashing Spanish belle Paquita Diana Pealver and the two decide to visit a local zoo. Vera is suspicious about Lionel's objectives and follows them. Unfortunately Vera gets bitten by the same Sumatran Monkey and Lionel somehow brings her home.Vera objects to this relationship calling Lionel irresponsible and unapologetic. The next day the bite begins showing its effect and Vera dies. Moments later we see Vera's corpse animating back to life but this time she has become more like a rotting corpse or more precisely a zombie. Lionel somehow believes that his mother could be cured and does everything to keep her alive. The townspeople believe that Vera has died and gather at her funeral. That night Lionel visits her grave and exhumes Vera's corpse. He is hampered by a pack of hooligans who think he is a body snatcher and beat him mercilessly. Vera's corpse comes out of the grave and infects the hooligans and a priest Father McGruder Stuart Devenie. In order to hide his mother's tale Lionel has to make arrangements for all the zombies at the basement of his palatial house he has inherited from his family. But his uncle Les Ian Watkin has his own plans about this inheritance. How Paquita and Lionel try to reunite against all the odds and fight away a pack of several hundred zombies forms the crux of the story.'Braindead' is a perfect splatter entertainer in all sense. The film captures some of the more bizarre and disgorging images that may leave the viewers in discomfort. I think they spent most of the budget on fake blood because gore and splatter are the ingredients that set the viewers' mood. Also it has some of the wittiest dialogs I've ever enjoyed listening to. I remember I liked Tom Holland's 'Fright Night' for its witty dialogs and its credibility as a next door tale. 'Braindead' too is close to any other credible next door tale except that Lionel's house is the home of raging and murderous zombies. Now there are zombies of all age and sizes and Lionel's interaction with them is more of a spectacle. The scene where Lionel deals with the zombie baby is ludicrous and a great stress buster. People may berate this one for its offensive imagery I still say that gore hounds and the admirers of bizarre and twisted have an ample scope to quench their thirst! So before planning to watch this one here is a sample for youPaquita Screaming Your mother ate my dog!Lionel Taking dog's fur out of Vera's mouth...Not all of it!".

If you're a film snob don't even bother with this because critically this is dire! But if you're lucky enough to just ride with it you will find the most entertaining film ever made. I was howling with laughter throughout with the OTT acting and blood. The dinner table scene and park scene are just back breakingly hilarious! Then the last half hour begins with just legendary gore amounts blood floods the room like The Shining and with the iconic lawn mower scene it would get any horror fan excited. You might think that continuous killing for 30 minutes would be a bit dull but it's not at all! The effects and kills are so inventive adding to the outrageous fun this film possesses. And then the ending comes out of the blue no one knows why but no one cares either because its so much fun to watch.Its bizarre gory madness that you have to see to believe. Unfortunately there is no in the middle. Either you find this one of the best films ever made or one of the worst films ever made. I think that you're an unlucky pup if you swing to the worst side because this is a film to be cherished to be watched over and over again and to leave you in a fabulous mood afterwards.".

	schema:headline " A Peter Jackson triumph with an unforgettable climax";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter Jackson's huge cult success has gone down in history as the goriest film ever made. With five gallons of blood being pumped a second for the splatterific climax this film does what SHAUN OF THE DEAD did years and years later it made zombies funny. Shot on a low budget probably about a millionth of what he had available to him when he made LORD OF THE RINGS Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD is a huge cult success that stands repeat viewing just thanks to the sheer humour and originality of the production. Intricate attention to detail has always been one of the director's best aspects and it's just as present here as it was when he became a multimillion pound director all those years later. But in many ways BRAINDEAD's quirkiness makes it stand out as still one of the best of the director's career coming just after his Middle Earth trilogy for me.The first hour of the film is an inventive low budget laugh riot. It mixes together a sweet boymeetsgirl romance with zombies and the result is clearly uneven but even so it works. The Kiwi angle breathes fresh life into the genre and Jackson explores the zombie mythos in many original ways forget mundane fleshmunching these zombies have feelings have sex have much more fun than a typical braindead gutmuncher you'll find in an Italian gore flick. The acting is over the top throughout adding to the film's deranged turn. Timothy Balme deserves huge kudos for his character's convincing transformation from lovable geek to macho hero and Diana Penalver is equally good as his feisty Spanish girlfriend. Yet the cast is also fleshed out with other great turns from the Australian and Kiwi supporting cast. Elizabeth Moody's domineering mother is the obvious standout but for my money the fleshcreeping Ian Watkin is just as good as the slimy Uncle Les. Yet the best turn for me is the guy playing the modturnedzombie who really gives the performance his all. Even though he's stuck with half a body for much of his screen time he's a real hoot in what is a physically exhausting turn.Anyhow the first hour is pretty good full of grossout comedy  the custardeating scene is the notable bit  and bizarre cameos from a range of odd characters. It's also full of gore and prosthetic effects from the embalmingmachinegonewrong setpiece  try holding down your lunch when you watch that one  to the rapidly rotting mother and the standout fight scene in the graveyard between a kung fu priest and a horde of the undead. So far so good but nothing I would ever have watched again. The zombies never number more than half a dozen and the limitations of the budget are obvious for instance much is made of a silly zombie baby including a paddedout interlude in a children's park in which Jackson seems to be going too far to make the audience cringe with his bad taste and violence. At around the hour mark a house party takes place which is soon besieged by the undead  and then things start getting REALLY gory! The party scene lasts until the movie's climax which also throws in a giant monster a la KING KONG for some fun and games. It's around forty minutes of classic filmmaking as our partygoers attempt to defend themselves against a growing army of the undead. It's here that Jackson's inventiveness really comes to the fore with a series of outlandish deaths and zombie hijinks each one crazier than the last! Lightbulbs go through heads hands exit from mouths and internal organs are soon popping all over the place as the screen becomes awash with blood. Here's where all the money went and it really shows in fact the halfanhour fullscale zombie attack is one of my favourite moments of cinema and enough to guarantee this whole film a fivestar rating. The special effects all prosthetic are wonderfully good and Jackson never skimps on his imagination for a second. We get flying severed heads evil intestines and more splatter than you've ever seen in your life. Then comes the one definitive moment that put this film in the history books for good  the infamous lawnmower climax. This sees Lionel finally deciding to fight back employing a petrol lawnmower in his fight against the ravenous zombies  with extraordinary eyepoppingly gory results. It's all done humorously with just the right overdone music and bulgingeyed acting and thankfully it seems to go on forever no blinkandyou'llmissit stuff going on here it's all focused lovingly up on screen. A superb ending which makes the film and the first hour worth sitting through I can't praise it enough. See for yourself!".

	onyx:emotionText "Peter Jackson's huge cult success has gone down in history as the goriest film ever made. With five gallons of blood being pumped a second for the splatterific climax this film does what SHAUN OF THE DEAD did years and years later it made zombies funny. Shot on a low budget probably about a millionth of what he had available to him when he made LORD OF THE RINGS Peter Jackson's BRAINDEAD is a huge cult success that stands repeat viewing just thanks to the sheer humour and originality of the production. Intricate attention to detail has always been one of the director's best aspects and it's just as present here as it was when he became a multimillion pound director all those years later. But in many ways BRAINDEAD's quirkiness makes it stand out as still one of the best of the director's career coming just after his Middle Earth trilogy for me.The first hour of the film is an inventive low budget laugh riot. It mixes together a sweet boymeetsgirl romance with zombies and the result is clearly uneven but even so it works. The Kiwi angle breathes fresh life into the genre and Jackson explores the zombie mythos in many original ways forget mundane fleshmunching these zombies have feelings have sex have much more fun than a typical braindead gutmuncher you'll find in an Italian gore flick. The acting is over the top throughout adding to the film's deranged turn.

Although be warned it is horrifically repulsive in places and is guaranteed to make squeamish members of the audience throw up  leave  cry.I had already seen Bad Taste before viewing this Bad Taste is Jackson's other 'Splatter' film so had a rough idea of what to expect. In all honesty I didn't enjoy Bad Taste that much which surprised the guy who endlessly recommended it to me he thought I would've loved the 'grossness' of it but my immediate response was one of boredom. Having seen Bad Taste I obviously had some idea of what to expect from this film but I was pleasantly surprised by how consistently this film cracked me up or made me shout out 'awwwwwwwwwww' in a suitably horrified yet entertained manner. This film also contains possibly the greatest line ever uttered on screen I kick arse for the lord. I have yet to meet a person who irrespective of their views on the rest of the film didn't find the kungfu preacher line  scene utterly fantastic.The vast majority of the enjoyment from this film comes from 1. The accents. I'm serious they're great especially in the first scene.2. The excessive over the top splattering of gore  blood  limbs. Some people heh mostly girls in my experience seem to find this repellent but if you have a strong stomach you'll love it.3. The zombie baby. Awesome beyond words.4. The Priest. Sheer cinematic genius.There isn't really much else to add that hasn't already been said by the reviewers on here. Braindead is fantastic but it's not for everybody. Best viewed in a group with the beers flowing. In my opinion Braindead is a much better film than Bad Taste but it had made me want to go back and give Bad Taste another shot. Words really can't describe how much you're probably going to enjoy this film.".

His mother follows them to the zoo where she is bitten by a Sumatran Rat Monkey from Skull Island Isn't that where King Kong's from?. Anyways she gets sick and dies....Well not quite. This movie general hilarity from start to finish with its over the top gore gruesome slapstick violence and zombie sex. Yes that's right zombie sex! One of the best bits is definitely the graveyard scene with the kung fu fighting priest but that is eventually topped by the end sequence involving a party zombies and a lawn mower. Oh and an appearance from Lionel's mother in a slightly different form! I'm all for more zombie comedies but I doubt any will be able to top the gory fun that is Braindead!".

Anyone who has ever done something wrong and felt that queasiness that comes with the knowledge that yes you are going to get caught can relate to the situation Michael is in. The main theme played several times throughout the movie is very creepy and mood setting I loved it.I found Brainscan far more compelling than the standard slasher flick or monster movie and would readily recommend it to anyone looking for something a little more psychological.".

As a result he has lost his zest for life and his respect for all things. He has ONE friend and a healthy teenaged fantasy life centered around the girl next door with whom he would love to enter into a relationship but he lacks the courage and fortitude to even attempt it. Because of his loathing for his present life like many of America's youth he retreats into the world of video games as an escape.Enters BRAINSCAN the newest innovation in VR video games. Michael has played everything on the market so there is little chance of this one being any better.Wrong! This one I think it's safe to say completely alters his perspective on life love and death. It changes his life.Excellent cinematography adequate direction and weak performances from Frank Langella as the local homicide detective why was he even IN this movie?! James Marsh as Kyle Michael's only friend and Amy Hargreaves as the girl next door tend to drag down the decent performance given by Edward Furlong and the excellent and compelling talents of T. Ryder Smith as Trickster. That character was an odd combination of Keith Richards Mick Jagger and Hannibal Lecter portrayed beautifully by Smith.While this movie is far below its possibilities it still is a top notch mind twister of a thriller. There are no scary moments however.It is not that kind of movie. This movie was more of a psychological mind twist than anything else.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT.Michael was forced by Trickster and ultimately the game to kill Kyle to show him that things DO matter friends matter. And then later encouraged to do in the little cutie next door for the same reason to show him that love also matters. And in discovering these truths he came to understand that he himself mattered a condition which he had never considered to be true.This movie has many holes in the plot some serious acting flaws and tends to be a bit immature. BUT it's still a very entertaining enterprise and well worth a good viewing or two.And lastly some critics have labeled the ending as stupid. If you have the mentality to comprehend the element of a twist you'll get the ending of this movie. Was it all in his head...or wasn't it? Was any single element of the game reality? Or was it reality which is the game? Definitely worth watching. I rate this high on my list of mind twists along with Fallen Identity and The Game. It rates an 8.910 on the B scale from...the Fiend .".

When his obsessions become his vices he experiences the fear of losing control of the only thing he truly possesses himself.

Stop reading here if you haven't seen it. The new video game Brainscan comes out and this young horror movie fan tries it. Soon he imagines cutting off someone's foot. Imagine his horror at finding a human foot in his fridge the next day. Then he comes back to reality. Or does he? There's a great scene at the end when he hands the game disk to the high school principle who banned his horror movie club. A refreshing change this horror film is actually scary and suspenseful.".

His father is never around and he only has one friend a guy named Kyle. Who helps him organize a horror movie club at his school. All he wants is for the girl across the street to notice him but he realizes she never will. Fed up with his isolated life he often retreats to virtual reality games and upon hearing about a new game called Brainscan he can't resist.The first time he plays it he has to kill someone in it and he does. Only to wake up and find that the random guy he iced really died and the foot he kept as a souveiner is in his freezer! As if this were not enough a freaky guy comes out of his TV telling him he is his guide. This is the Trickster.Trying to prove that the game is evil he films himself the next time he plays. only this time he does not remember anything once the level ends. But he finds that he actually killed his only friend Kyle and freaks out. Surprise Surprise the girl he likes shows up at his house dropping off this Hw. He also notices that she had been taking pictures of him as he had been doing the same and realizes that she likes him.After another game. He reaches the final disk however the task here is that he must kill his crush.Major Spoilers aheadHe almost does but says he cant and the Trickster comes to do it for him. He battles the Trickster and the Trickster kills him.But here is one of the best endings of any film. Furlong wakes up and realizes that from the time he put in the first disk to now he had been in the game none of that had happended! Only 2 hours have passed! he is pretty excited about that. He even goes and asks out the girl he likes she however turns him down. But before he can leave he notices a stack of pics like the ones in the game.The next day Furlong brings in the Brainscan disk and gives it to his principal. The one who had banned the horror club. And the Trickster pops out to haunt the principal...This was a great movie. Excellent acting especially by Furlong who is awesome. The movie is about exploring inner demons and desires. The game allows Furlong to kill and bring out his anger but it also nurtures his crush. When the game ends you can tell it had a big effect on him.This movie is pretty scary and disturbing but its also funny and action packed. So give it a shot!910".

Brainscan is the name of a hitech video game that places the player inside the mind of a serial killer. Bound to a timelimit Michael Bower Edward Furlong has to commit a motiveless murder without leaving evidence or witnesses. All very exciting of course until the next morning when Michael finds out that  surprise surprise  a real murder took place in his neighborhood identical to the one he interactively committed. Overcome with fear and denial he loses all contact with the outside world and becomes more and more dependent on Trickster the sinister host of the game. Despite being such a  oh yes  dumb film this Brainscan is rather wellmade and involving. The eerie tune is excellent the opening sequences showing Michael's returning nightmare of his mother dying in a roadaccident is atmospheric and the supportive characters are smoothly drawn. I particularly liked Frank Langella's copcharacter Hayden. He's a fatigue man who refers to Michael as the classmisfit and never raises the tone of his voice not even when the killer eventually stands in front of him. The visual effects were too hectic for me but there is some good oldfashioned low budget gore and sharp black humor. The absolute best gimmick of the entire production however is Michael's computerengineered butler named Igor! This guy is great!! He answers to every command with a monotonous Yes master and he even constantly repeats the message Master is busy...Master is busy when Michael to wishes to hold all calls. I have got to get me one of those! Anyway back to the movie The climax is an obvious giveaway and it only states what everybody already knows. Gamers generally are mentally weak people with difficulties to have mature friendships or relations ha ha. Brainscan is a horror movie especially intended for the Playstationgeneration so you better dispose of a healthy dose of humor in case you're not in this target group. Oh did I already mention it was rather dumb?? Special kudos goes out to actress Amy Hargreaves who supposedly portrays a 16yearold highschool sweetheart while in reality 24 years of age already.".

Furlong in my opinion one of the worst actors to ever grace the silver screen lacks the charisma to make the lead character fun to watch and he doesn't even succeed in making the character the least bit likeable.

That's where our lovely heroine a young social column reporter Madhvi Sharma is thrown. All these people from Mumbai's elite depend on her articles and she is the right person to befriend at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article. Later in the film we learn that even those who are Madhvi's friends are no different from these highsociety people. This was tough viewing for me although the film is unquestionably brave and the issues it deals with are interesting.The film's music is average.

One song which was particularly horrendous is Filmy Very Filmy. The film's writing is quite good. The second half is far better than the first as it turns more matteroffact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse. That's where the film has to be applauded. It was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and Konkona Sen Sharma's character's disappointment was very easy to relate to. She was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive. Atul Kulkarni's part was very small but he did full justice to it. Boman Irani is solid as the newspaper's editor. Sandhya Mridul is lovable as Madhvi's sassy roommate Pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it. The film's ending is really welldone and provides a certain sigh of relief after the unimaginably tough proceedings. Page 3 is a good film it is interesting and at times moving but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Write WordWhat you see is what you get. Not really! What Madhur Bhandarkar's brave and brilliant 'Page 3' does is destroy the myth attached to the glam and glitterati that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose livesread party habits we follow with such maniacal fervour which only our intrinsic voyeuristic streak can explain. The page 3 phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic. How exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate. Bhandarkar cleverly avoids that. He is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And in doing that he pieces together the various elements of this way of life. Like Robert Altmanalthough I'm not comparing Bhandarkar to Altman's genius Bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive. Whether it is a page 3 wannabe NRI the gatecrashers the newlyrich an upcoming model a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate charactersketch even if their parts may be miniscule. And therein lays the film's appeal. Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for Nation Today. Initially content with her job she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic profligacy. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moralpolicing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone. Hence the movie is not only about Madhavi but also equally about Deepak SuriBoman Irani Madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery Anjali ThaparSoni Razdan a socialite suffocating from the social pollution AbhijeetRehan Engineer a homosexual makeup artist and Madhavi's roommates PearlSandhya Mridul the sassy airhostess and GayatriTara Sharmaan aspiring actress. It seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many charactersand more in one story but full credit to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for penning a tight screenplay. The dialogues by Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail. Any narrative no matter how good can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances. Thankfully 'Page 3' brims with actors and not stars. Konkona goes through her authorbacked role with effortless ease. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part but almost overdoes it. Atul Kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character. At times the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possiblepaedophilia homosexuality etc.. But the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed. Ultimately Bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism but he takes it a step further. He takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world. These are the same people that indulged in newyear's revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by nature's ferocity! Clever writing skillfully incorporated songs able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values. 'Page 3' is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema.Abhishek BandekarRating  Poor  Average  Good  Very Good  Excellent29th January 2005".

How exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate. Bhandarkar cleverly avoids that. He is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And in doing that he pieces together the various elements of this way of life. Like Robert Altmanalthough I'm not comparing Bhandarkar to Altman's genius Bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive. Whether it is a page 3 wannabe NRI the gatecrashers the newlyrich an upcoming model a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate charactersketch even if their parts may be miniscule. And therein lays the film's appeal. Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for Nation Today. Initially content with her job she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic profligacy. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moralpolicing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone. Hence the movie is not only about Madhavi but also equally about Deepak SuriBoman Irani Madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery Anjali ThaparSoni Razdan a socialite suffocating from the social pollution AbhijeetRehan Engineer a homosexual makeup artist and Madhavi's roommates PearlSandhya Mridul the sassy airhostess and GayatriTara Sharmaan aspiring actress. It seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many charactersand more in one story but full credit to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for penning a tight screenplay. The dialogues by Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail. Any narrative no matter how good can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances. Thankfully 'Page 3' brims with actors and not stars. Konkona goes through her authorbacked role with effortless ease. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part but almost overdoes it. Atul Kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character. At times the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possiblepaedophilia homosexuality etc.. But the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed. Ultimately Bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism but he takes it a step further. He takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world. These are the same people that indulged in newyear's revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by nature's ferocity! Clever writing skillfully incorporated songs able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values. 'Page 3' is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema.Abhishek BandekarRating  Poor  Average  Good  Very Good  Excellent29th January 2005";

It has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person. No character is 100 good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical Indian movies and no character is 100 bad rather all are just different. The movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions drama and entertainment. For the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions. I would recommend all to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers those hipshaking parties of Bollywood for the Page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. But this is not all then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children how brutally her voice is suppressed. Even she is fired from the job. Then she couldn't find a job of crime reporter and has to do Page 3 again. Not only her but a very very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie. I would really congratulate the director for making such a great movie. Please do not afford to miss it.".

No character is 100 good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical Indian movies and no character is 100 bad rather all are just different. The movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions drama and entertainment. For the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions. I would recommend all to see the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers those hipshaking parties of Bollywood for the Page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. But this is not all then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children how brutally her voice is suppressed. Even she is fired from the job. Then she couldn't find a job of crime reporter and has to do Page 3 again. Not only her but a very very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie. I would really congratulate the director for making such a great movie. Please do not afford to miss it.";

Page3 remains one of his earlier endeavors on the subject. In this film he has exposed the world of entertainment journalism through Page3 which is dedicated for the glossy world of celebrities and late night parties. It's the story of a young journalist Konkana Sen Sharma in her first film who covers stories for the page just to find the news sold is not more than glamour and celebrities and the real stories get non of the footage. Overall the print journalism is nothing more than a business in which the news are lobbied for the sake of money and power.The story is indeed relevant but the presentation doesn't make much of the impact for its average development. In a way the main subject doesn't come out strongly due to the camouflage of several characters and subdued character of the protagonist. The film suffers a much from the poor character development. The film has a collage of several personalities but non get a proper attention for which the film fails to hold you at places. The star power a dynamic storytelling which appeared later in Bhandarkar's Fashion somewhat was missing in this one. Overall the film raises a nice issue but the film lacks a depth and clarity to tell its story.Rating 2 stars out of 4".

There are some appalling exposures and a well handled scene like a businessman is exposed for child abuse a malemodel gives in to the demands of a gay makeup man and the Boman Irani fires Madhavi from her job. Madhur Bhandarkar has handled such a subject well and also the best work after CHANDNI BAR. Music by Shamir Tandon is welldesigned and Cinematography by Madhu S.

All the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie along. Boman Irani did a great job. There is one thing that stands out in this movie THE STORY it is great and very realistic it doesn't beat around the bush it is very straight forward in sending out its message. I think more movie like this should be made i am sick of watching the same candy floss movies over and over they are getting hard to digest now. Everyone should watch Page 3 it is a great film.

I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I am talking about  all those token English phrases thrown into a movie in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. There are few Indian movies in which the English seems completely genuine  Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a great film it was a good film and the language did not seem put on. I feel ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only semienjoyable parts of this rubbish were Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score. Other than that do not even waste your time with this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a low budget Canadian film 'Bram Stoker's Shadowbuilder' is pretty good. Though it doesn't get off to a very good start and takes a while to build up momentum it's massively entertaining and the production values are better than the gimmicky error plagued box cover suggests I'll get to that in a minute. It might not be the greatest horror film ever but it avoids several pitfalls which most low budget horrors fall for most namely there is almost no gore in the film and the directoreditor actually threw in some style and flash rather than the suspense less suspense 99 of those B Horrors have gotta love that effect when Chris first lays eyes on the priest.The acting is mediocre for the most part with only one of the characters played well. Michael Rooker as the gun wielding priest tries to do his best Donald Pleasance impression but fails and ultimately resembles Pleasance's Dr Loomis from the Halloween films much too closely. The rest of the supporting cast is made up pretty much of Canadian nobodies who get the job done but just aren't all that great. The flicks' protagonist Chris Hatcher is played by 13 year old newcomer Kevin Zegers who handles the part surprisingly well not making Chris obnoxious or arrogant like most child stars would and have done many many times. Instead he goes the much harder route by creating a genuinely interesting character subtle and low key much like the film itself.Even though the producers had access to the special effects wizards behind 'True Lies' and 'The Terminator' they opted instead for the more traditional style of special effects utilizing lighting shadows and a very spooky atmosphere rather than heaping on the CG computer generated effects. The CG that did end up making it into 'Shadowbuilder' is very impressive and much better than that of even the highest profile direct to video thrillers.One subplot I really thought should have been expanded on and furthered was the friendship between Chris and his two friends. There was only one scene with the three together and though it had a different 'feel' from the rest of the film it would have seemed more at home in a drama than a horror film that scene was probably the best up until the climax. His two friends do appear later in the movie after they had been possessed by the Shadowbuilder and it seemed as though Chris had known them better than was explained in the story. I know I'm rambling but it really does look like some heavy editing occurred before release that shouldn't have happened.The biggest problem with the movie is the lackluster script. Much of the dialogue is cheesy and unrealistic and the way that the Shadowbuilder came into being was never fully explained. How was it summoned? What did the bible which is referred to often in the story have to do with it? Why was Chris so special and why did he receive the stigmata when baptized? It are these questions that the audience asks themselves over and over again while viewing this film and if they were properly answered then I would be reviewing a much better film.Another thing I wanted to point out was the awful awful packaging that the VHS version comes in not sure about the DVD edition as it was released by a different distributor Sterling Entertainment VHS was done by Lion's Gate. Not only does it have a cheesy holographic front cover ala Jack Frost not the Michael Keaton version and there is an obvious typo error on the back millennium is shown there as millenium but it looks as though the person who wrote the summary didn't even see the movie! There is a major error which stands out like a sore thumb after seeing 'Shadowbuilder' see if you can find it hint has to do with Leslie Hope's characterAn entertaining horror film with a bit of humor mixed in though it does have its share of problems a good pick for late Friday night... full moon... 13th of the month... solar eclipse... rent it if you can get a copy otherwise don't bother.".

The storyline is great but the screenplay is only reasonable considering the potential of the story and the cast. The boy is Kevin Zegers in the beginning of his career.

A demonic force is summoned to take the soul of a young boy who could become a saint and if done it could open a doorway to hell. However this entity can only travel through shadows and needs to collect souls to complete this task. But on its trail is Father Vassey who's heading to this sleepy rural town to find the boy first. The occult horror Shadow Builder is an adaptation of a Stocker story and the screenplay only seems to muddled it up with halfbaked theories as it leans towards its cheesy special effects nasty shocks and poignant performances led by Michael Rooker's grizzled renegade priest who gets around with pistols than say a bible and Tony Todd as some loony giggling Jamaican hermit that kids are afraid of. Actually Shadow Builder isn't all that bad but in parts it's fairly amusing and surprisingly dark in its atmospherics. The opening scenes are actually quite fun. Overthetop and silly but fun especially seeing Rooker at work in his choice of repenting sinners. The demonic entity has some striking facial details but basically it's black CGI smoke and like most villainous horror characters has something cleverly smart to say. With this last point I thought it would have been better suited if it said nothing at all. The direction is rather stylised for its low budget but the plot doesn't meander much and it has enough thrills in its formulaic patterns of good vs. evil or light vs. darkness. A young Kevin Zegers stars as the kid caught in the middle of it all.Are you truly repentant?".

It's able to turn anything to shadows which fade away in the light but that very same demon is also afraid of light. Yet with each kill it grows stronger and harder to kill as well as gaining the power to control dogs.Now the demon has a young boy in its crosshairs as that child has the potential to be a saint. Killing him will open the doorway to Hell and allow more demons loose into our realm of existence. Luckily a renegade priest named Jacob Vassey Michael Rooker from Guardians of the Galaxy but I'm certain readers of this site can name many other films he's been in is ready to battle the Shadowbuilder. And hey! There's Tony Todd with long hair and an eye patch he's also amazing in the making of feature with every word out of his mouth sounding like poetry! There's also a really interesting section where actor Andrew Jackson who played the Shadowbuilder talks about how the voice of the villain came to be.I'm certain that in 1988 having the Catholic Church be the bad guys felt pretty edgy. But today? I think today we can all accept that they're probably housing Shadowbuilders. Also if you're guessing that this story has little to do with the original story then you were renting movies in the 1980's too!

Sure enough the demon needs the soul sacrifice of a prophetic young boy terribly portrayed by child actor Kevin Zegers. It just so happens that the shadow demon is susceptible to the effects of bright light. What a coincidence and all this evil causes the town to go bonkers. Just about every plot device is predicable and contrived as typically dumb hunky sheriff Shawn Alex Thompson tries to piece it all together and Tony Todd is just plain stupid as the wisecracking town crazy complete with phony Pirates of the Caribbean wig and eyepatch who is conveniently obsessed with artificial light. The visual effects and thinly crafted script are average at best as well as the demon creature itself. Overall this has a lively pace and Michael Rooker's pistol packing priest is a hoot. This little horroraction flick came around just when this type of genre was dying out and the VHS craze was being replaced with the DVD revolution so it is considered by many to be a transitional rarity.

The first shadow created when God flooded the world with light is out to plunge it back into eternal darkness. I think.This film reminded me very much of The Mummy in structure. Evil dude comes back to life drawing powers from souls he devours in the midst of an avalanche of CGI. The film relies a lot on CGI which I didn't like at first. But if you accept it as more of a fantasy film then horror you will recognise its actually pretty well done. The demon also isn't that bad. The garish pink monstrosity yes it was pink on the DVD cover led me to believe it would be a yawn inducing man mincing around in a horned rubber suit but I was pleasantly surprised. Good use too of shadow and darkness so what you see of the creature leaves most to your imagination. Just the way it should be.Some parts of the film drag a lot and there aren't that many great moments. But that isn't to say there aren't any at all. Overrall though Shadowbuilder remains pretty average but still very enjoyable if you aren't looking for something that will blow you away. Unlike the Matrix wannabe priest with the twin 9mm's. The film needed a lot more of Neo shooting vainly at the afro toting bad guy.".

	schema:headline " Supremely underrated fantasy horror flick.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bram Stoker's Shadowbuilder is a completely awesome little horror flick that has gathered copious amounts of dust since it's mid 90's release. Forgotten and forsaken it should have spawned an epic franchise in the vein of stuff like Wishmaster but oh well we've still got the original beloved entry. Now just exactly how much of what we see in the film is based on actual Bram Stoker work is up for debate and a little beyond the scant research that I have done but it's a tidy little concept that's executed with Bmovie earnestness and a love for the spooky corner of cinema. The plot concerns a priest named Father Vassey played by genre titan Michael Rooker. Vassey is probing the rural Midwestern belt of the US looking for an ancient demon that's something like a shapeshifter who deeds on both darkness and human souls which resembles a cloud of dust reflected through hundreds of crystal prisms from what i remember. He's not your garden variety preacher sporting two laser sighted semi automatic handguns which come handy in tight shadowy corners and the jaded will to kick some supernatural ass not so much in the name of the Lord he doesn't believe in god anymore but more for a dark and personal crusade against the Shadowbuilder. The demon hovers around a young boy hungering for a soul within that has the potential to both become a saint and also open a doorway to hell in one stroke. Vassey is a determined and resourceful badass relying on nearby townsfolk for help and support and Rooker sells the schlocky tone with remarkable gravity that is his trademark. He almost always plays extreme characters in tense narratives and keeps up the energy like clockwork. There's a hilarious turn from a dread lock adorned Tony Todd Candyman as Evert Covey a backwoods eccentric with a penchant for Rastafarian speech and a part to play in the drama once we realize he isn't there solely for comic relief. This one is hard to find and almost no one has seen it but I'm hoping my review will change that because it's it's a little treasure and a fantasy horror classic for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shadow Builder doesn't only dispose of the ugliest VHScover in the history of cinema it also is one of the most ineptly bizarre films I ever had the misfortune of seeing. The film is a little bit based on a short story by Bram Stoker you know the guy who gained some fame with his vampire novel but the scriptwriter obviously had a lot of fun adding insane stuff that comes from his own imagination like a swearing priest who operates 9mm gunswith laser beams! Believe it or not but there are many interesting ideas and ingenious details noticeable in Shadow Builder and with a slightly more coherent script the film might have been very good. It introduces a quite original monster in the shape of Darth Vaderresembling demon that can only reign in the shadows. He has been summoned by a bunch of freaks and now he's looking for 12yearold Chris Hatcher. During the sun eclipse demonguy will use Chris to make the world come to an end because he was born with stigmata. Yes very clever!! Michael Rooker stars as the troubled priest who stalks the demon all over the country and Tony Candyman Todd has an insignificant role as the town's nut. The film is actually quite enjoyable but only during the moments when the plot doesn't necessarily have to make sense like for example the neat sequences of the town in chaos or when the demon possesses random souls in order to gain power. Director Jamie Dixon tries to uphold a constant level of action and most cast members seem to fulfill their job with great devotion. I can't properly judge the use of special effects though. Some visual gimmicks are quite well done whereas others are lousy and on the verge of pitiful. Definitely not a mustsee but if you're a fan of silly horror it's worth watching when it comes on TV or something.".

Sadly Shadow Builder is not definitely not one of those. I don't recall if I have ever encountered a movie which tries so hard to be scary but is so lacking in suspense and frightening moments. This movie is more likely to produce incredulous guffaws than squeals of terror. Full of both clichd and ridiculous characters chief among whom is the central character the eponymous Shadow Builder who floats around making ominous and serious pronouncements to the other protagonists in a basso profundo tones. Sadly the makers of this movie did not understand the concept of 'less is more' and that subtlety can be very effective in evoking an atmosphere of menace. Subtlety is in short supply here.All that being said though I didn't hate this movie. My enjoyment however was the type that comes from watching something so bad it was actually good. Well maybe not good but certainly amusing!".

People call this an intelligent film and I'm not saying it's not but that comment says a bundle about a lot of the other films that have been out there lately where characters just don't seem human and act more like plot robots void of any recognizable human feelings or dimensions. Evil and good in absolute black and white strokes. No most people are more complex than that even if mass media doesn't seem to want to poke much beyond the surface that they present to us. This movie is intelligent because it's very intuitive in its understanding of how most real people relate to one another. There are two particular scenes that I especially love. One is with the younger daughter bringing home purely by coincidence the exlover of her mom for a supposedly blind first date with the mom. She and the ex play it cool and ironically pretend they don't know each other and by the end of it the lover comes to understand the mom's maternal love for her daughter and why she can't continue with him as her lover which is all spelled out without anyone saying anything directly. The second scene is slightly less poignant but also shows the unspoken understanding between good people. It involves the satellite cable installer and the mom and how they communicate indirectly and in a silly smart way the nature of their newfound relationship with one another and what they want from it. Their conversation in bed after the first time doing it was a gem. Very strong recommendation!".

	schema:headline " The simple necessities of life";
	schema:reviewBody "Allison Anders' unabashedly southern drama Gas Food Lodging concerns Nora Brooke Adams a struggling waitress with two teenage daughters who wants nothing more than the best life for both of them as they live paychecktopaycheck in a congested trailer park home. She is single after her husband abandoned them following the birth of their two daughters and she is left to raise the rebellious teen Trudi Ione Skye who would rather skip school to work alongside her mother and chase boys and the more introverted tween Shade Fairuza Balk who wants nothing more than her mother to find true love.Nora's life becomes more complicated when Trudi's disinterest in school is fueled when she meets Dank Robert Knepper a British petrologist who knows the direct way to her impressionable mind. Dank puts every situation Trudi has gone to in perspective and provides a listening ear that isn't judgmental nor dictative rationalizing her promiscuity due to the fact that she lost her virginity in a gang rape many years ago. Trudi's insistence on skipping school and even work for Dank leads Nora to give Trudi one month to find a new home.In the meantime Shade makes an attempt to seduce Darius Donovan Leitch a boy from school she has a crush on by dressing up with a wig and a dress. When that plan falls apart she becomes infatuated with Javier Jacob Vargas a local boy with a blunt attitude who also teases her about her outfit immediately after her attempt to entice Darius falls through. However Shade's main goal of setting her mother up with a halfway decent man comes to fruition when she finds Raymond Chris Mulkey a local gravedigger who proves to be more than she bargained for.I can continue on with the plot of Gas Food Lodging right down to the moment when the end credits roll but that's not what this review is for. Gas Food Lodging plays like a more compelling and wellacted soapopera predicated on believable locational problems for its characters and real human drama rather than a constant array of dramatic circumstances positioned to provoke oohs and ahhs from the audience.Beneath its sunsoaked exterior and its desolate landscape is a film concerning the deep human desire to be wanted. Anders picks a more vibrant and colorful film about alienation than I've seen in quite some time. It's a film where the characters don't have to actively march around like they are miserable selfloathing misfits but rather those who feel like making the best of a bad situation whilst trying to find someone they can tolerate who also loves and respects them. Nora while never openly admitting it is trying to find love and acceptance to fill the void of her husband who kicked it relatively early after the birth of Shade. She slums and wastes away at a waitress job making ends meet but compromising her talent and happiness for a paltry paycheck each and every week.Shade on the other hand finds solace in old Mexican films. The only one not looking to find a relationship for herself Shade represents selflessness and a Jane Austen Emmaesque character of trying to play matchmaker for her mother in order to kickstart some kind of long lost happiness. Shade seems to be the kind of person who will strive to make everyone else around her happy only to tragically look around one day and recognize that she is incomplete in life.Then there's Trudi the character the film wants us to focus on the most. Trudi is the kind of woman with motivations not uncommon to many teenage girls and that motivation is to ditch the drudgery of homework pop quizzes and tests and embark on a life far more exciting and enriching than anything that could be housed inside a schoolbook. Trudi is also the kind of person that has a fear and an inability to cope with being alone with her thoughts which is why she'll search and try to befriend somebody regardless of how bad or toxic they may be to her wellbeing in a romantic way with hopes that she can achieve some kind of connection.Gas Food Lodging is an appropriate title for this film because it deals with the immediate things in conventional American life we need gas to commute food to survive and lodging to thrive and life comfortably. What's missing from that title is love connection and happiness. Maybe those things could be secondary or buried underneath other priorities necessary to be viable? It's up to you.Starring Brooke Adams Ione Skye Fairuza Balk Donovan Leitch Chris Mulkey Jacob Vargas and James Brolin. Directed by Allison Anders.".

This does make it the first coming of age film that I have really enjoyed. On my previous track record of this genre most of them if not all of them didn't seem to come across as real characters.Which is where this movie succeeds. All the characters in this movie feel real they act like real people in real situations that I can actually see a family going through.Now the plot is that Nora and her two daughters Trudie and Shade live in an uneventful town. Shade believes in getting a guy for her mother because of old Mexican romantic movies and Trudie is rebellious and stays out for long hours because of dates she has with guys and she doesn't mind if she has sex with them because her first time was a gang rape. Nora just wants to keep the family afloat with as little problems as possible. Over the course of this movie Trudie gets pregnant with a man she believes to be the one but isn't Shade meets their father she also falls in love and learns a few things about herself.Because I usually analyze the stories in reviews it seems that I have only worked out now that coming of age films are about characters and the series of separate events that create their arcs not about story. And with this movie it delivers. The character of Shade especially is one that I like and possibly one of my favourite teenaged characters in film.So would I recommend this movie? If you can handle a little bit of a slow pace I am not kidding this is the only thing I see wrong with this movie and enjoy coming of age films then yes This is definitely worth it. If I can find more coming of age films of which a leading character sounds interesting then I will most certainly be watching more.".

And with this movie it delivers. The character of Shade especially is one that I like and possibly one of my favourite teenaged characters in film.So would I recommend this movie? If you can handle a little bit of a slow pace I am not kidding this is the only thing I see wrong with this movie and enjoy coming of age films then yes This is definitely worth it. If I can find more coming of age films of which a leading character sounds interesting then I will most certainly be watching more.";

Is it possible that the next person you fall in love with could be a notorious heroin smuggler or the counter girl at the express luncheonette counter?  Wong KarWai the writerdirector of Chungking Express seems to think so. The film is broken into two tales.  The first story is mainly about the sadder side of love.  Love comes and brings us light and joy but it also goes and leaves us feeling empty and needing fulfillment.  The two main characters in this half of the film a police officer played dolefully by Takeshi Kaneshiro and a heroin smuggler played icily by Bridgitte Lin interact for only ten percent of the story but their meeting leaves them both with memories that will last life time.  The story ends on a high note that shows us that a simple act of kindness can bring the most unreceptive people to appreciate the beauty hidden in life. The second and far stronger story centers around two people and their interaction at a fast food counter in the Kwaloon section of Hong Kong. Tony Leung plays the part of a rejected lover perfectly and gives of the air of being sad without ever really being pathetic.  Faye Wang's quirky portrayal of the freespirited counter girl who helps Leung forget about his exgirlfriend is exactly what the film needed to counterbalance its darker first half.  These characters and their bizarre relationship illustrates that love can manifest itself in any number of ways many of them unconventional. The mechanism that allows these seemingly disjointed stories together is the camera work.  Wong KarWai uses a decidedly unique filming technique for much of the first half of the film a blurry handheld technique think Blaire Witch on drugs used during the chase scenes.  The recurring style in the second half is a timelapse type shot with people around the main subjects moving very fast and the subjects themselves moving in slow motion a really cool effect.  The camera styles add a common surreal element to each of the stories while still keeping them somewhat independent. Perhaps the most striking element of the film is the interconnectedness of the characters and situations.  There are many establishing shots showing characters inhabiting the same places at different times and even the same places at the same times without noticing each other.  This style of filming can alter the viewer's perception of reality daring us to believe that we are all extras in somebody else's movie.".

	schema:headline " Achingly beautiful filmmaking";
	schema:reviewBody "Masterful Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar Wai understands that love is about the unspoken moments between people the hidden gestures betraying loneliness. Chungking Express is a unique expression of such notions of love. The film doesn't pretend that love is allembracing and constant in the way so many predictable films would suggest. Love for the protagonists of this film comes and goes between subtle glances  always elusive. Indeed if a level of contentment can be reached at all for these characters  it is a fleeting moment a memory of a song the way that somebody smells. There are so many essential moments in this film  when Dinah Washington's 'What a difference a day makes' plays over two lovers cavorting the moments when characters talk to inanimate objects to overcome their loss of love the brief glances between the second policeman and the waitress across the counter of the fastfood restaurant. It has been dismissed as an exercise in style over substance by many mainly due to the hypnotic way in which the film is shot and the lack of a real story as such. I don't feel the need to defend it from these accusations because the beauty of the film is there on the screen and nothing I have said or could say could really do it justice.

	onyx:emotionText "Masterful Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar Wai understands that love is about the unspoken moments between people the hidden gestures betraying loneliness. Chungking Express is a unique expression of such notions of love. The film doesn't pretend that love is allembracing and constant in the way so many predictable films would suggest. Love for the protagonists of this film comes and goes between subtle glances  always elusive. Indeed if a level of contentment can be reached at all for these characters  it is a fleeting moment a memory of a song the way that somebody smells. There are so many essential moments in this film  when Dinah Washington's 'What a difference a day makes' plays over two lovers cavorting the moments when characters talk to inanimate objects to overcome their loss of love the brief glances between the second policeman and the waitress across the counter of the fastfood restaurant. It has been dismissed as an exercise in style over substance by many mainly due to the hypnotic way in which the film is shot and the lack of a real story as such. I don't feel the need to defend it from these accusations because the beauty of the film is there on the screen and nothing I have said or could say could really do it justice. It breaks my heart every time.";

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING SMALL SPOILERS MAY BE GIVEN BELOWToday being a lazy Sunday I finally got around to watching Chungking Express. This film is something which has always been on my lengthy cinema bucket list.I am joyous that I took the the time viewing into this film as it was both uplifting and meditative amongst the chaos.The film's plot revolves around two separate narratives regarding two policemen working within Chungkingboth of whom have gone through recent break ups. Their stories are told sequentially and are both running in chagrin until they encounter a new woman.For the first story we become acquainted with He Qiwu a man who pines over his most recent relationship with a girl called May. Whilst the May of which his relationship recently ended with has no screen time there is plenty of monologue spoken from He Qiwu and interaction with other characters regarding her that as an audience we can feel his pain. I mean who hasn't been there before? He Qiwu goes on the rebound and seeks out a girl after much self pity. It is at bar that he encounters a certain femme fatale.The femme fatale is not issued a name in this story segment however it just adds to the sense of mystery she aesthetically displays by the costume of which she wears A Blonde Wig and Glasses. It becomes quickly evident within the first fifteen minutes of the film that she is a dangerous presence as we see her organizes an illegal drug smuggling operation. When He Qiwu and the woman with the blonde wig cross paths it is not because he is after her. It is because he found himself out at a bar on the prowl and as we as viewers are sure of the ineluctability of them meeting together is certain. They are not united together as lovers however there is a slither of hope given to He Qiwu after their encounter and in his current position a morale booster.In the second story the unnamed Cop 663 is going through the motions post break up with an air stewardess. We see that the stewardess had decided to visit a snack counter which he frequents and gave a letter to the owner regarding her wishes to break up and keys to the apartment. This is all caught by the exuberant Faye a worker at the counter. As Cop 663 does not wish to look at the envelope being fully aware of what the letter will detail Faye falls him for and uses the keys to start rearranging the house while he is at his dayshift unaware. From there the story builds around the meetings between of both Faye and Cop 663.Throughout both stories there are reoccurring motifs that we take in such as expiry dates the name of May a model airplane California Dreamin' by The Mamas  Papas a Garfield stuffed toy and more which have been omitted from this review. The symbolism behind these help build the strength of both stories and also slightly relate them. The setting of Chungking is a multicultural place and in being so it is interesting to hear dialog hear dialog in Mandarin Cantonese Japanese and Indian throughout the film. It is hard for the setting to not draw you in. However despite the streets being as flooded with populace as they are we are left with the contrast of the characters usually being in isolated locations. Taciturn and with a running self monologue.The soundtrack should be a key player in any film watched and in The Chungking Express it is not something which is not to be ignored. Most notably the soundtrack is dominated by California Dreamin' during the second half of the movie. The highlight song for me personally is a delightful Cantonese cover version of the song Dreams originally performed by the Cranberries sung by no other than Faye Wong main actress of the second segment.In regards to the cinematography it is hard to believe that shots being taken are not being done so under natural lighting. In a scene where the Indians are assembling clothes and toys we get various cutaway shots and amazing editing. In particular one shot of shoes filled with cocaineheroin being put away is shot upside down which for unknown reasons I really love The editing is quick and fast paced rarely lingering.Through the use of shaky held hand camera during chase scenes and the busy streets we feel disorientated and just as lost as the characters on screen. I believe this film is an equally a comfort to those in love as to those who are out of love. Don't give up.".

The main difference between this one and other romance films is Chong qing sen ling doesn't picture eternal love people holding hands in hands kissing or crying and moaning in pain when it's is over. It's more about lead characters just trying to get over the pain and discovering that undying love was never that strong indeed. Talking about getting over the pain since it's a Kar Wai Wong nobody will dare thinking a typical work.At the first time i watched Chong qing sen ling what hit me was director's original style in telling his stories how he could make me feel exactly the same mood with the characters and still no tears in the whole movie. Besides who needs tears while you can get rid of them by making some sports? In fact if you are terribly under the influence of this film and you are dumbed by your lover too don't be surprised when you find yourself drinking five or ten glasses of water in a row or something equally stupid as that. Because stupidity is what we are expected to do when messed with love anyway. Before through or after the relation it really doesn't matter does it?After you watch Chong qing sen ling you won't be the person you used to be. At least California Dreaming will have a special place in your heart i guarantee that!".

On the other hand Faye's charismatic bouncy personality is so infectious and definitely made her my favorite.  It all comes out through her facial expressions her dancing her bright eyed look and super smile is awesome!  My mindset is fixed with that song by the Mama and the Papas and Faye.  That and her Cranberries' tribute.  When she and Tony  are onscreen together it's magic. My favorite thing about Tony is for all the different roles he's played he always comes off as himself.  I'm sure the ladies love his scenes in the apartment!I wouldn't consider this a great Hong Kong movie.  This is a great film PERIOD.

	schema:reviewBody "Chungking Express is a film about time and coincidence... a continuation of the themes and images developed in the director's first masterpiece Days Of Being Wild and a precursor to the ideas and cinematic ideologies that will carry through to his greatest films In The Mood For Love and 2046. Unlike those two projects which seem completely internal in the way in which they blur the emotional pointsofview of their characters  by slipping between the various narrative layers  the basic setup here is simple... two Hong Kong cops consumed by melancholic romanticism wander through a labyrinthine city like Ghosts haunted by their individual though ultimately quite similar memories of lost love. Their paths cross on two separate occasions but never intervene. Instead the two stories are presented separately one after the other with each story presenting various echoes of a theme that ripples throughout.The style of the film is very much indebted to the style of the French New Wave of the early 1960's with Wong and cinematographer Christopher Doyle making great use of the available lighting and mobile handheld cameras to capture the action in a very fast very kinetic kind of style. Thus those only familiar with Wong's more recent films which benefit from larger budgets and longer periods of production might be surprised at how ramshackle and idiosyncratic this earlier work is... with Wong pretty much devising the whole film during a break in postproduction on his epic historical piece Ashes of Time and apparently writing most of the scenes in the afternoons then hitting the streets to film them that same night. As a result the film moves at a breakneck pace and never once pauses to analyse it's inaccuracies or indeed inconsistencies which at the end of the day isn't really a problem... instead like Godard it's all part of the film's charm.The first story of the two is probably the most exciting... tipping it's hat to Godard's  bout de souffl and Cassavetes's Gloria with it's story of a lovesick cop trying to come to terms with a recent breakup whilst simultaneously falling in love with a heartless hitwoman. Like most of the film but more so than the second story this segment never stops to take a breath instead we are continually propelled into the dingy underworld of the Chungking Mansions with Wong and Doyle's camera all handheld intimacy and stroboscopic distortion bobbing and weaving through crowds of people snaking it's way around a labyrinth of market places airport terminals and back street bars and offering up a neverending kaleidoscope of colours speeds movements actions and bursts of garish violence. The story hinges around a chance meeting  the use of the clock is an important visual reference point and the central character's obsession with tinned pineapples with an expiration date of May 1st  though it's easy to miss this within the melange of action violence and moody noir.The second segment still has a fairly fast pace but seems more relaxed and intimate in comparison to the first with that great theme of Wong's  unrequited love  being established in the bizarre though utterly charming relationship between a recently heartbroken cop and the counter girl and the local Midnight Express takeaway. This segment is much more playful than the first with a nice integration of character and a lighter tone which is perhaps why most people consider it the most memorable segment of the two. For me there are enough similarities and stark coincidences linking the two segments to make them work with Wong as a director showing us his ability to switch from something as claustrophobic and actionpacked as segment one to the relaxed charming almostcomedic tone of the second. There's still the Godardian influence only here it's more Une Femme Est Une Femme than  bout de souffl whilst the use of music trading the cool European synthesisers and multicultural mishmash of sounds in favour of the bouncing pop of the Mammas and the Pappas and a Cantonese cover of the Cranberries song Dreams helps to make the whole thing that little bit more enjoyable.Overall Chungking Express is a likable frantic and somewhat offthewall though I hate to use that expression combination of noirreferences newwave romance and an experiment into the way that cinematic narrative can be developed... all captured with beautiful stylistic flair by KarWai and Chris Doyle. The performances from the four main leads are all exceptional with Takeshi Kaneshiro and Tony LeungChiu Wai essaying the two lovestruck cops while Cantonese popstar Faye Wong and the beautiful bewigged Brigitte Lin portray the respective objects of their affections. Like the film it's self the characters all have a charm and individuality about them hinting at a deeper character with depth and backstory even if we don't necessarily get to see the whole picture. Again this is another trademark of Wong's... as the film really amounts to an accumulation of scenes characters and moments that can be pickedover by the viewer and discussed until some greater sense of meaning becomes clear.The ending of the film refuses to pander to the conventions of traditional Hollywood filmmaking and is all the better for it with Wong instead further illustrating his theme of coincidence and dislocation  with the allusion to California replayed by a character sitting in a bar called California  really highlighting the central notion of two entities existing at the same time without any kind of awareness. Certainly with its briskpace seesawing plot and likable characters this could be called the most accessible Wong KarWai film  perhaps the best place to start for those new to his work  but of course beneath all the newwave references and selfconsciously chic scenarios this is still a pretty deep film about the nature of time regret memory love loneliness and of course the need to belong.".

To say this film is unique is an understatement.  While Chongqing senlin drastically deviates from traditional Hollywood blockbusters it is still able to provide as much excitement as Armageddon and as much confusion as Waterworld.The plot connects two storylines one of which revolves around a blond wigged woman played by Brigitte Lin who is hired to smuggle heroine out of Hong Kong.  The other focuses on young Cop 223 named He Zhiwu played by Takeshi Kaneshiro who has just broken up with his girlfriend of 5 years. Depressed and lonely Cop 223 decides to buy a can of pineapple his exgirlfriend May's favorite fruit every day until May 1.Wong strings the two stories along using mixes of handheld camera and set shots normal film video and pixilated images.  The plot of the film is interesting and gripping as well as hard to follow but the true nature of the film comes through in the actual film itself.  The direction and cinematography are both superb and for viewers looking to appreciate a well made movie Chongqing senlin should satisfy but for average Joe this film may rate somewhere near The Postman.Chungking Express released in 1994 and directed by Karwai Wong takes place in Hong Kong and is the classic girl meets guy girl likes guy girl breaks into guy's apartment with stolen key and plays with his possessions film.  What the film lacks in plot clarity it makes up for in technical excellence.The plot connects two storylines one of which revolves around Cop 663 played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai who breaks up with his airlines stewardess girlfriend.  The other story follows a young service industry worker named Faye played by Hong Kong's pop queen Faye who falls in love with Cop 663 and does her best to become part of his life without ever needing to talk or be with him by using his apartment only when he's not there.The two plots entwine and work off of each other but they are slow and unimportant.  The commentary on loneliness and depression and the depiction of the difficulties of real everyday relationships are the true focus of the story and Wong uses pace and perspective in order to advance these ideas. Chungking Express proceeds slowly and deliberately creating a sense of repetitiveness that adds to the feeling of depression showed by Cop 663. The film also uses a lot of hand held camera which allows the audience to lose themselves further in the frustrations of the relationships.  While Chungking Express may be too slow paced and trivial for Hollywooded viewers film buffs and aficionados would be interested by its unique film style.".

Now I feel like having watched a standard and uninteresting Hollywoodstyle romantic comedy. I must confess that I liked watching the movie to the end but this is only related to the fact that I find Faye Wong quite beautiful! It unfortunately seemed to me that the whole movie was a waste of time if you exclude seeing FW for an hour which is of course not a cinematic experience.The first two movies I mentioned above contained many dimensions of the human heart they made the audience think on the characters the stories and their own lives. However the story in this movie is so shallow and the characters are all 2D and very dull. They never surprise you do or say an interesting thing throughout the movie.The two stories of the movie almost had nothing in common except being the policemen as the male characters having some kind of love affair with stewardesses some time and those stories contribute nothing to each other. I wonder why did the director bring them together.The music was also so repetitive and useless after a point. Colour usage and some interesting shots were all that deserved nice comments in this movie.Finally I must congratulate Wong KarWai for his career path from CK Express to ITMFL and 2046.

Undercovered cop 223 was left by his girlfriend and he falls for a mysterious woman with a blonde wig. It happens that she is a drug smuggler. Does it matter?

I hadn't yet? the opportunity to be there. but I was once at Chelsea Market in Manhattan and I thought immediately at the movie of Wong KarWai.Don't look for a logic in this movie because any logic would be fake Wong doesn't try to arrange the moments in some succession because each moment exists on its own carries its own truth and doesn't care about the rest. Instead of a synthesis the movie offers nonrelated glimpses instead of an ultimate truth it offers contradictory slices of truth. It's not life as we think it should be it's life as it is.It's soaked in neon lights. It's fun it's noisy it's fast. And above all it's filled with incredible hypnotic poetry.The right word for this movie would be mesmerizing. Enjoy!".

This unique film is split into two separate stories which cross connect with each other in more ways than one.The first story tells of lonely cop 223 Takeshi Kaneshiro who is obsessed with expiration dates. Suffering from a broken heart he's giving his exlove May one last chance. When his canned food expires so does his love for May. Although on the eve of his birthday he meets a woman Brigitte Lin who is suffering from her own broken heart whom he is able to share his pain with.The second story tells of cop 663 Tony Leung ChiuWai who is suffering from romantic problems with an air hostess Valerie Chow. He eases his pain by going to a small time deli express and meets one of the expresses lovely exployees named Faye Faye Wong.A great imaginative and powerful film that should not be missed by anybody who is serious about movies. Boasting an excellent soundtrack by Frankie Chan and Roel A. Garcia with songs featured by CantoPop queen Faye Wong along with several other old time hits just gives me more reasons to recommend this to you. Two huge thumbs up.".

He eases his pain by going to a small time deli express and meets one of the expresses lovely exployees named Faye Faye Wong.A great imaginative and powerful film that should not be missed by anybody who is serious about movies. Boasting an excellent soundtrack by Frankie Chan and Roel A. Garcia with songs featured by CantoPop queen Faye Wong along with several other old time hits just gives me more reasons to recommend this to you. Two huge thumbs up.";

	schema:reviewBody "Chungking express is one of my all time favorite films. It is a story of human despair and loneliness told with a good measure of comedy as such it can be seen as a spinoff of the black comedy which usually deals with more morbid issues such as death. Although Chungking Express dwells on human despair there is always a lingering feeling of hopefulness. When you see a downtrodden person there are three ways to go about you could either walk past the person with an air of apathy you could kick him while he is down or you could wrap your arms around him and hoist him up this film is the kind of film that sympathizes with the characters and attempt to hoist them up. It shows the audience that sadness and desolation are natural parts of life but what one must always strive to do is look forward with optimism.The direction of the movie is excellent. The camera works in such a way that it feels as though you an audience member is right in on the action standing beside the characters as an observer as such the movie has a deep subjective feel to it. The movie is jarring at times but that adds to that subjective experience. There are various points where the movie jumps ahead in timeline in very quick succession giving the audience the feeling of the fleeting nature of time. The movie does not spoonfeed you rather it asks you to think and to feel. The acting feels very natural almost improvisational and it is required for a movie such as this. Wong Kar Wai one of the auteurs of world cinema has made many great movies since but to this day Chungking Express stands out as his best and one of the best movies in my opinion of all time.".

An overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like Karwai Wong and Tarantino but to me it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over. The only redeeming characteristic I find is in the production values and them there just ain't going to cut it all by themselfs.This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes.  Sorry.  The calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir.  I get the same big yawn and letdown reading what I guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film that never lead to anything truly comprehensible.

The same character is also seen carrying on a deep meaningful rapport with his towels soap stuffed animals dirty laundry etc. The shaky wandering handheld camerawork was another annoying feature I could have done without. And if that isn't enough to make you puke in your popcorn we hear the old 60's ode California Dreaming by the Mamas and Papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence.Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company though I cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother. He was known to have remarked I'm happy to love a movie this much. A lot of us though hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "beware some spoilers follow Chungking Express is all about love apparently but I don't think it can rightfully be called a romantic movie. The characters are all so obsessive neurotic and downright oddball that the film makes love seem more like a bizarre illness than something to be cherished.The narrative is awkwardly split into two distinct stories both involving mopey guys who are mooning over girlfriends they've lost. The two guys are pretty similar  they're both nice passive quirky and cops  so I wonder why the filmmakers felt the need to tell two separate stories in the first place. Why not flesh out one or the other more thoroughly? Or do a proper anthology with lots of shorts about love?Despite their weirdness the characters are endearing but their behavior often veers away from realism and into the realm of what I call movieland. It seems implausible for example that a woman would fall in love with a complete stranger and then decide to gradually clean and refurbish his apartment when he's not home and without his knowledge over the course of several weeks. That kind of behavior is sort of insane isn't it? In real life it'd get you arrested. It stretches credibility even further that it appears to take this guy forever to notice the changes to his surroundings and when he finally does notice he discusses the matter with a bar of soap. That's what I mean by movieland. Compounding my irritation the characters sometimes decide to wax poetic about their personal philosophies in that mockdeep movie way saying things like people remind me of expired cans of pineapples or some such rubbish. Is this really deep or is it just like that old Saturday Night Live sketch Deep Thoughts by Jack Handy? Thankfully Chungking Express is somewhat elevated by interesting shots of Hong Kong and energetic but occasionally tiresome handheld camera work. The narrative has a disjointed feeling that is both a plus it forces you to watch events closely which is good and a minus because sometimes it's too confusing. In the first story for example I quickly lost track of exactly what on earth the woman in the blonde wig was up to and who she happened to be shooting at each particular moment.It sounds like I really hated this movie but I didn't. I just think it fits into that category of arthouse movies that really aren't so great. I applaud it for being experimental and daring but I don't think it really sheds a lot of light on the human condition. It's too slick and selfconsciously overthetop to achieve that particular goal.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie will not appeal to everyone.This is two stories in one. I've heard a lot of people saying the second half was better but I thought both parts were equally effective.Chungking Express was basically filmed while Wong Kar Wai was on hiatus from the Ashes of Time project. It's obvious this film provided the director with an escape or a freedom of expression that the audience feels from the opening credits until the end of the film.While the story may feel disjointed  the style is extremely consistent and the pacing and music in the film really balance so nicely here.I had enjoyed the two films I had seen from this directorhappy together and Fallen Angels but I absolutely loved this one.There is something very real about this dreamlike world that the director has created here. The acting and writing are sharp but it is the overall moodfeel of this film that really makes it stand apart.Won Kar Wai throws in some parallel characters that resemble the leads and he also jumps time within the main characters lives. Both of these aspects add a little more intrigue to the story.This is a film that definitely needs repeat viewings to capture all the little nuances.Proof that when a talented director just throws something together it can be more powerful than an epic that takes years to make.Could have used a little less of the Chinese version of the Cranberries tune. That's my only gripe. This film has a few scenes that rank right up there with some of the fondest film memories that I have. This is a GREAT movie.Very unique stylish effort. 93100".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another film made in Germany in the sixties based on a story by Edgar Wallace and directed by Alfred Vohrer. It's also one of the best films of its type. The plot is typical of Edgar Wallace it's wacky and features a plethora of strange and unique characters. As the title suggests the film makes a river the Thames naturally its central setting and this is very important for the plot as it focuses on a murderer with a strange modus operandi. Scotland Yard have been called in to investigate a series of murders happening on the river  witnesses have reported seeing a man in a wetsuit and all of the victims are found to have been killed by a harpoon  thus leading the murderer to be nicknamed 'The Shark'. Inspector Wade is called in to look into the murders and it soon becomes apparent that they may have something to do with a local smuggling operation. His efforts are concentrated on one family in particular that owns a bar and allegedly a large fortune also.Alfred Vohrer stylishly directs the film and seems to have a fascination with mirrors  as there's plenty of shots featuring characters' reflections. The plot is well worked and the way that the investigation is presented is interesting although to be honest I would have proffered to have seen more of The Shark. A murderer swimming around a river and shooting people with a harpoon gun is a fascinating idea but it's not capitalised upon as much as it could have been. The central cast is good and features many familiar Krimi faces  including Joachim Fuchsberger Eddi Aren't and Klaus Kinski who has a small but memorable role as a smuggler. There's plenty of good set pieces to keep the interest up although the focus of the mystery is not on the identity of The Shark but on the reasons for the killing meaning the final unveiling of the villain at the end is a bit of a moot point although it does at least come as a surprise. Overall this is an excellent Krimi that works in spite of a couple of problems and it will certainly be of interest to fans of the genre.".

	schema:headline " Atmospheric German Wallace adaption";
	schema:reviewBody "Between 1959 and 1972 a stream of 32 ! films based on criminal novels from famous British author Edgar Wallace had been produced by the German Rialto film company. The Inn on the River is an early example and surely one of the highlights of the series. The film benefits tremendously from the atmospheric black and white photography shot by cameraman Karl Loeb. There are plenty of impressive night scenes with eerie lights and shadows. Foggy canalization funnels lonesome harbor quays subterranean and underwater locations capture the audience from the beginning. Though some side aspects of the script seem to be far fetched and only loosely connected with the entire plot it doesn't distract from the main story line which is loosely based on Wallace's novel The India Rubber Man. The film focuses on the police chasing a mysterious Jewel robber known only as the Shark. Disguised in a black divers suit he frequently kills in proper style with his harpoon! The Inn on the Thames so the exact translation of the German film title was a huge success when released in 1962. Apart from the suspenseful crime story one of the reasons for this might be that the thriller elements are complimented here more than usual by a simple but effective fairytalelike romance. The film's young heroine Leila Brigitte Grothum very pretty though she seems rather limited here as an actress is captured at the sinister harbor Inn Mekka just like a 20th century Cinderella. She is repressed by her evil stepmother excellent Elisabeth Flickenschild and threatened not only by the Shark but by numerous gangsters around some of them lustfully longing for the under aged girl. The prince coming to her rescue is of course Scotland Yard's Inspector Wade in his usual role handsome Joachim Fuchsberger he even calls her Princess at their first encounter. Wade suspects that the Mekka Inn is a smuggler's nest somehow connected with the Shark. Among the many doubtful characters he finds here is the sneaky Russian merchantman Gubanow great Klaus Kinski in one of his typical supporting roles that became a trademark of the seriesAs usual in German Wallace Krimis of that time the film wasn't shot on location. Hamburg and the Elbe river doubled in for London and the Thames. There is only few badly fitting original British stock footage from a rowing boat race. Other minus points are the uneven title music and the comical character of Barnaby Eddie Arend an eccentric fan of water sports. Arend who can be funny at times is allowed to overact so shamelessly that his screen presence becomes annoying here. Nonetheless this is a great little thriller. It's impact on filmmakers can be viewed in Dick Maas Horror action flick Amsterdamned 1988 which borrowed more than the idea of a killer in a divingsuit from this one.".

There is even a So and so did this because... explanation towards the end but I still have a few questions. Anyway the film is about a killer named The Shark who is killing people in London with a speargun. He is able to get away because he dresses in a scuba outfit and uses the city sewer lines to escape. Inspector Wade Joachim Fuchsberger of Scotland Yard is on the case.The film has a lot going for it especially in the Theremin themed bits involving The Shark. The image of the killer in an all black wetsuit is atmospherically shot and suitably creepy. Dick Maas was definitely impressed by it because he used it to similar effect in the 80s action thriller AMSTERDAMNED. Another plus is a young Klaus Kinski in a major supporting role as sleazy French businessman. On the downside the film features some awkward comic relief in the form of the bumbling Barnaby character. And as I mentioned earlier it does get confusing for a bit. At one point three men in black scuba suits are running around. However the end revelation of who The Shark is pretty unexpected and director Alfred Vohrer does his best to send you off the track.".

It helps that the setting is not the typical English manor house but instead the environs in and around the river. Helping things along is a great cast many of whom have appeared all through the series including Klaus Kinski.If one wants to see Kinski's range as an actor one need only watch the films he appears in this series since he's often very different in each one. I really recommend this film as an enjoyable film to curl up with on a dark and stormy night.I've seen it a couple of times now and enjoyed each viewing".

	schema:headline " Harpoon hassle";
	schema:reviewBody "Das Gasthaus an der Themse or The Inn on the River is another German blackandwhite film based on an Edgar Wallace novel. This one is from 1962 so almost 45 years old. The runtime is also the usual as this one here stays slightly under 90 minutes. The director is Alfred Vohrer who despite being more known for his Winnetou works also worked on quite a few of these Wallace films. The trio of writers who adapted the novel for the film also had lots of experience with Wallace films before and after. I am generally not a big fan of these films but that is rarely a fault of lead actor Fuchsberger or the supporting cast. It is just that the story is rarely interesting and honestly very similar in all these films. A police investigator is working on a case in search of a highprofile gangster who is usually somehow disguised. The detective and we only find out at the very end who the criminal really is. A touch of ScoobyDoo but not half as entertaining.As for this film here the killer appears in diving gear and kills with his harpoon. Honestly compared to previous villains this was a pretty stupid outfit and made it even harder for me in taking this film seriously. Of course as usual with these films there is also a damsel in distress in there who needs protection from the detective when the killer targets her. Of course he manages to kill everybody as always but not the most helpless character. This is what really hurts these films in terms of credibility. So yeah the story is weak in this one too and even the presence of Klaus Kinski before stardom cannot save this film from being honestly mediocre. I have not read Wallace so I am not sure if the adaptations are always the problem or the base material. In any case despite one or two memorable scenes this is not a good watch. Thumbs down and this film is proof of how bad the 1960s were in terms of German cinema. Don't watch. Also on a sidenote this film is officially a sequel of another Wallace movie about a criminal frog. This does not make sense though as the Frog does not appear in here and none of the other characters from that earlier film do either. I guess they just wanted to cash in by including that reference in the title. Pretty pathetic if you ask me.".

He's got his st together and people are willing to pay him to glue together the worst movie ideas and turn them into a semiwatchable blockbuster. However Pain  Gain isn't one of these movies.Wait how does that make it good? You ask? Well my position is that Bay actually cared about this movie. He pitched this movie for years even when he was a more struggling director and nobody would buy it. Eventually this movie was made on a measly budget of 26 million. Not exactly peanuts but nowhere near the budget Bay is used to. I believe this encouraged him to put some real thought into it.First of all this is a dark dark comedy at its core. It's Fargo ramped up to eleven and edited into the pace of a 2hourlong seatedging action thriller. The movie manages to go from serious to gory to slapstick all in a matter of minutes and somehow still manages to work. It'll be impossible to keep yourself from cracking out in laughter even though all of the characters are completely unlikable and selfabsorbed. The movie constantly mocks gym jocks selfhelp optimism and class privilege. The acting is superb. All of the cast was well chosen from Dwayne to Shalhoub and especially Wahlberg. And that shocking fridge horror moment comes with the realization that it all actually happened. Yes unlike Fargo that disclaimer at the beginning of the movie is an honest one and the actual events are even more outrageous than this movie itself.Most of the criticism seems to come from this movie being made as humor deriving from a true event but I don't think it could have been done better any differently. All of the changes made to the events were understandable in order to make it watchable as a movie Adding extra humor in order to balance the absurdity merging a few characters into one much larger one or even actually toning down a few parts to make them more believable. There are so many memorable moments that are permanently affixed to my brain unlike other Bay films which are utterly forgettable. That makes this a cult classic and easily one of my favorite movies.".

With Pain and Gain he returns to lowbudget territory since his debut Bad Boys in 1995. The result  the film is a debauchery in style  it's all over the film. Although Bay cuts back on the explosions and robots mercifully everything else has Bay written all over it and considering how morbidly ridiculous the film's subject matter is Bay tackles it in such a headon and energetic manner that the audience is whisked off for the insane ride ahead.For this movie he has assembled together Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie as the three bumbleheads who have their hearts set in the right goal but clearly lack the intellect to do so. All three men look jacked up and play their parts as ridiculous as the part goes for it especially Johnson who clearly is having a blast showing off a completely different side of him as opposed to what we've been seeing him of late. Wahlberg plays a character so dangerously goofy and dumb one will wonder whether such a person exists in real life. Tony Shalhoub's unfortunate but still jerkish character sets the tone for most of the movie as his predicament grows from one spectrum of ridiculousness to another. By the time we've reached sexy Bar Paly's and hilarious Rebel Wilson's love interest characters the audience have probably seen enough.Then in comes Ed Harris as Detective Du Bois. Just when I thought the film was about to careen off the rails into insanity. He's the only sane person in the whole movie and his presence helps bring balance and clarity to what was a ludicrous first half.Comic relief is key in Bay's action films but here he's going all out at comedy and he sure does pull of the stops. The film is simply put hysterical. The fact that it was indeed a true story makes it all the more hilarious to watch who honestly can think of some story like this and pull if off straight?I am aware that since this is a film some liberties had to be made to the story and characters. Some scenes were undoubtedly exaggerated but which one? Every scene looked and felt so surreal every major character ridiculous every line of dialogue inducing a chortle from the audience. But it was a dementedly fun ride and Bay after making two bloated sequels about giant robots finally returns to his stride.".

One after the other they've always told the same stories utilized the same clichs and have been brutalized by critics everywhere. Personally I never had anything against the guy. He does what he loves to do and almost 100 of the time gives his audience what they're there for. But don't mistake him as a one trick pony. Bay has been making a career of blockbusters for the sole purpose of having the luxury to make serious less expensive movies. Pain  Gain might be proof positive of my point. It was quite a daring move for Bay to commit to such a bold feat as to make a film based on the true events of the Sun Gym gang. Like most of the film's critics and there are quite an abundance of them I agree that maybe it wasn't such a good idea to reenact the actual murders and backstabbing actions that these murderers did and play them up for laughs. Because yes this is indeed a comedy. Or is it? I can't tell what genre this movie falls under. But I cant deny thats its entertaining. I was very interested in the story of the actual events. What I'm trying to say is the execution couldn't have been better in telling the story. The performances from Wahlberg Johnson and Mackie were equally unique and insanely enjoyable. The three of them were able to capture the meatheaded simpletons that these criminals really were. The movie as a whole works. As a thriller I was thrilled. But as a comedy I was sort of indifferent. At times I found myself laughing at some of the film's darker shaded sense of humor and rolling my eyes at the cringe worthy Adam Sandler style gross out jokes that the film unwillingly felt obligated to shove down our throats. An identity crisis this film indeed had. When you get past all these cons Pain  Gain is a well crafted violent joy ride. Its one of the most underrated films of the year and its worth your time in seeing it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching PainGain today I was thinking that this film could have been handled as a straight drama. But given the absolutely preposterous nature of this true story I think playing it as a black comedy was the only way to go.The film reminded me a whole lot of Fargo with a bit of Casino and Goodfellas thrown in. Three bodybuilders who become jealous and resentful of the wealthy clients they have at a health club they work at conceive of a plan to rob one they truly think is an obnoxious rich fool. That client Tony Shalhoub is just that is besides the point these guys are like the hired criminals in Fargo and everything that can go wrong does. This film is exponential Murphy's Law. And Shalhoub proves to be tougher than these he men can imagine.The three muscle bound Moriartys are Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie. Their back stories are provided with their own narration as Scorsese did in his crime classics but these guys have results like Fargo though not at first. Their own weaknesses in the end defeat them.PainGain is laced with humor with a dash of pathos in as far as the criminal masterminds are concerned. They've sculpted themselves into the bodies beautiful and such AdonisApollo features deserve the best that life can offer. They think some cosmic joke is being played on them that an arrogant little worm like Tony Shalhoub should have so much wealth with all the big boy toys he can possess because of same. So Wahlberg Mackie and Johnson resolve to fix things as a matter of justice and entitlement. I think if you have a quirky and bizarre sense of humor and a jaundiced view of life you'll go for PainGain.".

Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie bring the old saying in way over your head to whole new level of hilarious. Their performances are like The Three Stooges with biceps. A crime comedy doesn't get better than this..PAIN  GAIN is your textbook Michael Bay there are beautiful girls fast cars that 360degree spinning shot where the camera circles the actors plus it's back in Miami too the land of all kinds of colors and sunshine! Yup! PAIN  GAIN looks feels breaths and benches like a Michael Bay movie alright! Minus the giant robots and that's a good thing in this case. I have to give props to the true story that became the basis for this movie just the idea of three knucklehead bodybuilders chasing American dream and the mishaps that happen along the way because of their stupidity it's practically a formula for a laugh riot it practically begged to be made into a movie. Plus it's scripted by the screen writing team who brought us Captain America The First Avenger the humor that banks on the cluelessness of the three leads just keeps on coming and hitting the mark. What a great cast including the great Tony Shalhoub and the rising starfunnywoman Rebel Wilson who steals every scene she's in. That big girl is going to go places.Mark Wahlberg leads the pack but this ain't The Hangover because all the three lead characters in PAIN  GAIN are idiots that's the attraction they think they have it all figured out but they never think things through so when things go haywire they're forced to improvise and when they do improvise people get hurt and even after that they still mess up in trying to cover their tracks it's the idea of stupid people trying to get a shortcut to fortune some people can't handle such fortune they mismanage it and they're left hungry again. The film probably would make the late great Tony Scott proud too because it moves like an ADD person one scene moves to the next very quickly which also speaks about how rash the three leads are in making their moves. Dwayne Johnson Mark Wahlberg and Anthony Mackie have impressive comedic timing you should see them panicking or cornered their performances get even more intense. I hit the gym but I don't even come close to what Wahlberg Mackie and Johnson do regularly perhaps. Their biceps have biceps that's how ridiculously massive they look on the big screen their belief in fitness is going to make you feel quite insignificant. PAIN  GAIN may have some commentary about American Dream on whether or not those who do achieve it actually earned it but in the end it's just a laugh out loud cautionary tale told through the style of Michael Bay. www.ramascreen.com ".

	schema:reviewBody "It's nice to see Michael Bay take a little break from explosionfueled action movies and do a dark comedy based on events that took place during the fall of 1994 to summer of 1995 in Miami. In this film Mark Wahlberg Dwayne Johnson and Anthony Mackie play a trio of bodybuilders of a Miami fitness center who kidnap a millionaire named Victor Kershaw and extort him for money. Their plan is to take his money and his house and then murder him. While their attempt to obtain his wealth succeeds their plan of eliminating goes terribly wrong and unleashes a turbulent chain of events.I honestly enjoyed this movie it was fun to watch at times. However I can't say I enjoyed every single bit of it. Some parts such as the kidnapping were exciting to watch. Then there were other scenes that didn't quite make much sense. I sat through a few scenes where I thought what's the point here? then the movie would suddenly get exciting again. Aside from this this movie is very quotable and had some memorable lines by Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson. The two showed some good comedic chemistry in many scenes and it made the film more enjoyable.Some people may be offended by this film because it's a comedy that takes horrific events that occurred in real life and turns them into comedic situations. However I kinda like the idea of the film being a comedy. I think the director made this film a comedy because of the characters and their stupidity. Mark Wahlberg plays Daniel Lugo the owner of the fitness center Sun Gym and the leader of the gang who does the kidnapping. Then Dwayne Johnson who plays Paul Doyle a member of the gym and Anthony Mackie who plays Adrian Doorbal a friend of Daniel Lugo. These characters were not very smart and their attempts on kidnapping stealing and murder often lead to unwanted results. The characters' stupidity is kinda what made the movie entertaining and somewhat funny.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't thrilled with the movie but that doesn't mean it was not good. Actually I think this film had incredible substance due particularly in part to the casting. I would have given it 7 stars but the length of the film took it down a notch they could have knocked off 1419 minutes worth of unnecessary and sometimes boring footage.The film started off with Wahlberg seeming to be just like Wahlberg. But long story short he and the film evolved to a character that fit him and vice versa. Based upon the plot I think it was a good match.Dwayne Johnson is not brand new to drama but this was a different kind of role nonetheless. I don't feel he was 100 there but his likable character makes you just ignore it. I think with a few more roles like this he'll be better.I'm not that familiar with Mackie but he did a great job in his role. Apart from Shalhoub he was probably one of the most believable characters. He made me think of a subdued and more serious version of Mike Epps.Shalhoub....well what can you say about this guy? He was awesome in Monk and his style is always great. He is a talented actor and the casting of him was a solid choice. He has that goof look to him yet his face can show some noteworthy seriousness. This was no Giamatti being cast as a thug...Shalhoub can pull off a tough guy pretty well.I've always been fond of Ed Harris but his role was insignificant. Same for Corddry.All in all this was a wellmade film deserving to be watched. I doubt I would ever watch it again due to it's slow development at times but I'm glad I did see it. The casting was unexpected and unique.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movie reviewDoes the Rock appear in every movie throughout the summer? Anyway this movie is based on a true story which makes it that much better when you see it. Reason for this? These criminals have to be the dumbest people in the world. The story revolves around 3 fitness trainers or muscleheads that decide they want the better things in life. Well of course the best way to get them is to steal it. The mastermind to this is Danny Lugo played by Mark Wahlberg who again is great who concocts a scheme to kidnap one of the clients of the club Tony Shalhoub and extort his millions. So he recruits Adrian Anthony Mackie and Paul Dwayne Johnson to exact this brilliant plan. I would dive into the plan but I really don't think there was one. That is the beauty of the genius of the plan. They said screw it let's wing it and since they are aforementioned idiots this leads to some extremely funny moments. The movie itself is not action but more of a comedy that just shows how dumb people are. So let's just say they painstakingly achieve their goal and score the money but that is only half of it. In their own ways one score wasn't enough due to their various eccentric behaviors and now a new plot is hatched which you would think after the first plans failure barring getting the money they may have learned they are not cut out for this. There are plenty of little side plots in the story that when the movie sums them up for you in court you will be just listening to the account of this heist and just plain out laugh not even realizing you just saw it in the past two hours of viewing. The characters work so well off of each other that the humor comes fairly quick yet subtle. This is all put together very well into a fine flick that delivers the laughs. I was impressed that Michael Bay pulled this off since he isn't known for comedy. Set in the 90s and in Miami the look is just what you would expect fluorescent colors jean shorts etc. all are abound. A very comedic look at a violent yet amusing crime that actually happened. I would love to know just how accurate this movie is because it just seems so over the top on how stupid the characters were. Oh one thing I noticed that I am unsure how this fits into the criminals lifestyles and is more used for humorAn obsession with the male sex organ real and fake the subject comes up a lot. All and all an enjoyable movie and the Rock once again steals the show with his gd fearing coke head character that will just keep you laughing. 6.610 IMDb 6.9 I personally think it was just a bit too long but that is OK. Bonus for wrestling fans look closely for a Kurt Angle sighting in this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pain and Gain can at best be described as a cautionary tale for the use of steroids other drugs and the unquenchable thirst for wealth. The problem is that there is very little evidence to suggest that this was the filmmakers' intention.Through the first 20 minutes of the movie I was able to stomach the buffoonery of all the obnoxious characters. Actually I even enjoyed this portion because I was under the impression that the filmmakers were intentionally mocking these muscleheaded psychopaths by portraying them as complete morons. As I continued watching it became increasingly clear that every character involved in the story not just the muscle heads was a complete moron. It was then that I suspected that the filmmakers were not so much intentionally mocking the triumvirate of body builders rather they were feeding the kidnappers what were intended to be funny lines to make these people appear more likable. This could have been done for two reasons 1. The filmmakers were attempting to make light of a seriously dark situation so the story could be told without becoming completely offputting. 2. The filmmakers actually enjoy these despicable sorts of characters and wanted to represent them as decent guys who just made a few mistakes. I tend to lean toward the latter since the film makes virtually no effort to empathize with any of the victims. Kershaw Schaloub was made out to be the least likable person in the entire movie. Given what the other geniuses were willing to do just to make a quick buck including torturing him and beating him nearly to death he should have been awarded at least an ounce of sympathy. Nope. Sure he may have been a douche but he didn't attempt to rob or kill anyone. He was a meanspirited preepiphany Scroogetype guy not a violent felon. No doubt he was a bad guy but he should not have been the bad guy of the story. Yet somehow that was the film's implication. The one highlight of the movie is the performance of Dwayne The Rock Johnson. His role of reformed drug addict who finds Jesus loses him then finds him again was nearly lost amidst the mountain of crap that makes up the bulk of the movie. That pretty much sums up my feelings about Pain and Gain. It is wellsuited for the type of person that enjoys tasteless jokes that lower the bar for the intelligence of all mankind and random scenes with fast cars and strippers. There is even a completely unnecessary diarrhea gag. If that's your thing go see this movie. Otherwise go read a book and stay away from steroids.".

	schema:headline " Michael Bay should stop being a doer and start being a don'ter";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Bay's Pain  Gain is an ugly film. It's retraces a terrible case of kidnapping and torture but trivialises and commercialises the crime by turning it into a comedy. The Transformers director would argue he's satirising the American Dream with this insane but true story of a bodybuilder who kidnapped a client and stole his entire lifestyle. In reality this is thirdrate material. It is an overpumped imitation of Scarface but with Bay's idiosyncrasies. It's louder dumber crasser and more offensive than the other two versions and cynical enough to pass its failings off as a reflection of its characters while exhaustingly basking in the very same excesses it wants to criticise. Hollywood resurfaces the Scarface story when America is in economic strife. The best Scarface movie is the 1932 film by Howard Hawks and Richard Rosson. Paul Muni's gangster Tony who rose through the ranks of the mob by eliminating his enemies reflected the greed of the Great Depression era. The American economy collapsed because of over production stagnant lower class wages consumer excess and the fall of the stock market. Scarface was remade by Brian De Palma in 1983 to further comment on greed and America's new economic recession. President Ronald Reagan introduced Reaganomics including the trickledown theory. Corporations were given large tax cuts so the wealthy would earn more and therefore spend more on investments. This was meant to increase jobs and salaries for the lower class. It was an economic disaster that only benefited the wealthy. The gap between the rich and poor by 1989 was according to MSNBC the biggest since 1947. PostGlobal Financial Crisis Hollywood continues to see the bankability of Scarface. Another remake is due next year. Despite being released now Bay's film is adapted from a 1999 article series in the Miami Times by Pete Collins. The film takes place between October 1994 and June 1995 Mark Wahlberg plays Daniel Lugo a personal trainer dissatisfied and jealous of his wealthy client Victor Kershaw Tony Shalhoub. A motivational seminar from Johnny Wu Ken Jeong encourages Daniel to start acting in life. He hires two men to help him kidnap Victor. The first is fellow trainer Adrian Doorbal Anthony Mackie who is being treated for impotency by Robin Rebel Wilson. The second man is Paul Doyle Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson who has done time but is now sober and has found religion. After bumbling their way through the kidnapping they torture Victor forcing him to sign over his property. Also involved are Sorina Bar Paly an immigrant girl Daniel has told he is CIA and Det. Ed DuBois Ed Harris a private investigator who comes out of retirement to pursue the group. The articles can be read online. It's surprising how much of the story is actually true. There are compromises like certain characters erased and details about Daniel's life drastically changed. What's more dispiriting is the flippant treatment of this story and the tonal instability. The humour is broad juvenile and unfunny compounded by a meanspiritedness that attacks people of all shapes sizes genders and ages. Some scenes including the dismemberment of a body are so grotesque that I struggled to continue watching. An extract from Collins' article describes the real Victor's torture Now he learned quickly what being a prisoner of Lugo was like. For two hours he felt the electric lash of the taser gun the explosion of punches the pistolwhippings. The men took his allweather lighter and burned him on his arms and chest. It's hard to see how any of these experienced actors none of whom are convincing saw the funny side of this or the appeal of their characters. Isn't it time Rebel Wilson was given a role where she can provide more than just punch lines? The technical aspects remind us why Michael Bay is such an awful director. The actors are framed with titled camera shots for no particular reason and the frazzled pacing of the movie doesn't allow time for scenes to unfold. There's no feel for any tension. The sunshine swimsuits and cars of Miami are photographed with high colour saturation and an adolescent perverseness so that the film resembles a pop music video when it should be a critique of capitalist greed. Catchy but obvious song choices like Gangster's Paradise by Coolio compromise the soundtrack. If the film is about a man who wants too much and blindly thinks he can profit off America by cutting corners then inspiration wasn't too far away. The excesses of this nasty repellent film are as hypocritical as they sound. Michael Bay should stop being a doer and start being a don'ter.".

The acting was fine the special effects were fine and the fact that Rebel Wilson was in it was a big plus for me but it was just not enjoyable for me.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was painful to sit through. The director tried way to hard to make something different and although the first half hour was mildly interesting it quickly takes a turn for the worse. It tries to humanize three monsters and make you sympathize with these murderers. They are completely stupid and unlikable but the director wants you to root for them. It completely lacks a sense of humanity and you quickly realize that although this is a true story it is simply outrageous in the way it is presented. There were a few bright comedic moments but there were put in the wrong place like when they were gruesomely chopping up body parts. The director should be ashamed of himself. If he would have made it so that the bad guys were unlikable this could be a truly great movie. But instead he wants you to be their friend...and I say no thanks. This is certainly not what I expected from the trailer either. The movie was a true shame to the cinematic world.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was painful to sit through. The director tried way to hard to make something different and although the first half hour was mildly interesting it quickly takes a turn for the worse. It tries to humanize three monsters and make you sympathize with these murderers. They are completely stupid and unlikable but the director wants you to root for them. It completely lacks a sense of humanity and you quickly realize that although this is a true story it is simply outrageous in the way it is presented. There were a few bright comedic moments but there were put in the wrong place like when they were gruesomely chopping up body parts. The director should be ashamed of himself. If he would have made it so that the bad guys were unlikable this could be a truly great movie. But instead he wants you to be their friend...and I say no thanks. This is certainly not what I expected from the trailer either. The movie was a true shame to the cinematic world.";

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Bay the director of the 'Transformers' movies directed this A comedyaction movie based on a true story of which in the 90's three guys decided to kidnap and torture a rich guy until all of his assets were sent over them in a month's time. That is a very stupid decision because the families of the victims yes there was more than one victim are still alive to see this comedy based on something horrible that happened to a family member. If this wasn't just a movie review I'd add that in to hurt the rating but sadly I'm reviewing this movie as a movie. 'Pain  Gain' was enjoyable and pretty good. I'm reviewing it on that basis.This movie looked like mostly a comedy in the trailers but it's not really that funny other than a few funny parts. I didn't even know if it tried to be funny very much because most of the time it wasn't. In the trailers it also tried to make itself look like a heist movie and it really wasn't a heist movie. Yes they do kidnap a guy but it's not a heist. I just wanted to clear that up.This movie yet enjoyable was boring in some parts. It had to pick up at some points. This movie also didn't really have a strait forward story line either. It wasn't very focused and the pacing changed many times. There aren't very clear main characters there's just all the characters and it seems to be everybody's movie. That part of this movie annoyed me. Some things happened that got intense and did clearly show the main characters but most of the movie does not. About the pacing being off in about half an hour of the movie covers a month but then an hour of this movie will cover in hour. It just goes all over the place. The writing and the directing was very strange in that sense. I had no idea if it was poor directing or if Michael Bay thought it needed to go that way.The acting in this movie was good because two of the main characters are played by Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson which are good actors. The other guy Anthony Mackie did a good job too. That made the movie enjoyable. I'm not saying they nailed their parts but they did well. As the movie goes on it gets better despite the boring parts. There's some action and some intensity near the middle. There's not that much intensity until the end though. The end had action and intensity and you see the characters break. That's another good thing there's some good character buildup but it's done almost all by monologue which is a bad thing. Anyway it was the end that made this movie get a positive rating. I really liked that part. There was also some buildup to the characters breaking that didn't give it away or not get the message to us. That part of 'Pain  Gain' was nearly perfect.So I liked the movie even though it had some directing problems and it was kind of slow. It was enjoyable mostly because of the end fun and a good time. The end and some parts near the end were done well. This 710 means that the movie was good and I liked it.".

The setting of the typical action movie kidnapping and torture warehouse location as a warehouse full of exotic sex toys rather than being funny simply cast the same level of banality on the gruesome torture scenes as porn does for sex in general.

The film rushes from scene to scene never giving any moment time to resonate with emotion. The result is the feeling that you don't get to know or care about any of the characters.

Jessica Lange has chops as an actress and could have made Ginny into the sympathetic character she is in the book. Unfortunately the screenplay and direction didn't allow for it. The film feels mechanical almost like you can picture the director checking off each scene in her todo list. Make the breast cancer known check. Show attraction between Ginny and Jess by having him touch her neck check. Show Larry deciding to give up the farm check. I agree with those who said it felt like a Lifetime special. I'm disappointed because the actors are topnotch especially the freakishly gorgeous Michelle Pfeifer and the criminally underrated Jennifer Jason Leigh. The land was just as much a character in the book as any of the people and I wonder what the director could have been thinking by not showing this more. In the end you feel like the sexual abuse and the death of a sister are manipulative plot devices to jerk out the tears. I blame the direction and the screenplay adaptation. Terrence Mallick could have done justice to this great book. I wonder what Jane Smiley thought.".

There are echoes of King Lear in the story of a wealthy farmer who decides to divide his estate among his three daughters.  But I thought the reviews overestimated the extent to which the story uses the Lear parallels.  It's just a catalyst for a strong drama of family conflicts and repressed memories coming to the fore that soon goes its own way.  There are some script problems  the youngest daughter's loyalty to her cruel father seems quite inexplicable and as a lawyer you would think she'd know better than to put a hopelessly senile person on the witness stand.  The fine cast does pretty well especially Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer although as usual Jennifer Jason Leigh is barely adequate as the youngest sister.  Maybe watching this on a stormy Sunday night helped put me in the mood but I rather enjoyed this one.".

The two lead actresses are brilliant especially Jessica Lange who deserved an Oscar nomination for this. I loved the way her character slowly changed through the movie and Lange can evoke so much emotion in the viewer with something as small as a hand gesture. Pfieffer is strong as well although the story mainly revolves around Ginny and I don't really see why Pfieffer gets first billing here. I strongly recommend the film espeically on dvd.".

I started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended.  Thank you Jane Laura and Jocelyn for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie!  Thank you cast for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness!I recognized the Angry sister the Runaway sister and the sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusive Husband and why he was there and then the Father oh oh the Father... all superbly played.  I also recognized myself and this movie was an eyeopener a relief a chance to face my OWN truth and finally doing something about it.  I truly hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there.Since I didn't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land they weren't fighting each other at all  I watched it a second time.  Then I was able to see that if one hadn't lived a similar story one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all.  That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance.But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!I don't give a rat's ass pardon my French about to what extend the King Lear story is followed.  All I know is that I can honestly say this movie has changed my life.Keep up the good work guys you CAN and DO make a difference.".

I recognized the Abusive Husband and why he was there and then the Father oh oh the Father... all superbly played.  I also recognized myself and this movie was an eyeopener a relief a chance to face my OWN truth and finally doing something about it.  I truly hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there.Since I didn't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land they weren't fighting each other at all  I watched it a second time.  Then I was able to see that if one hadn't lived a similar story one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all.  That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance.But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!I don't give a rat's ass pardon my French about to what extend the King Lear story is followed.  All I know is that I can honestly say this movie has changed my life.Keep up the good work guys you CAN and DO make a difference.";

The adaptation is basically faithful to the book at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes.  The film doesnt really dazzle except for certain scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer but it does a thoroughly competent job of visualizing this wonderfully tragic story.  As far as movies adapted from novels go this was definitely among the better ones.  If nothing else it has sent me back to my bookshelves to rediscover favorite passages from Jane Smileys excellent novel and back to King Lear to brush up on the minor characters in order to see just how deep the parallels go.

I don't think I had ever even heard of it before.  Well this is exactly the kind of find that I dream about since I have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and me.  With a few exceptions Neither of us can even get them to consider watching the Lord of the Rings movies but my Dad LOVES the Matrix trilogy  GO FIGURE we have very similar tastes in movies.It was a particularly AWFUL day today weatherwise.  It poured rain all day so I popped in this movie and shortly after I was mesmerized.This has to be one of the alltime best sleepers I have seen.  Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are GREAT in their roles especially since they are playing very different types.  Jessica Lange's character is a peoplepleasing follower who despite her being the senior child in the family rarely takes a leadership role.  Rather she bows to her father Jason Robards and sister Rose Pfeiffer and is hellbent on teaching her little sister Caroline Leigh how to follow suit.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays a very STRONG willed cancer survivor who is barely able to keep the anger at her unhappy life contained.  This movie is five years prior to White Oleander mind you so it was definitely inspiring to see her playing such a strong angry character.I would have to say that this movie will probably appeal more to women. However true movie buffs who enjoy a film for what it is regardless of genre or target audience will have a hard time denying the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what they do the people involved and those who love them.  I don't know how I missed seeing this movie before now but it sure was a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon. ENJOY!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The tormented women in the epic tearjerker A Thousand Acres hope that change will brighten their lives. Instead change ushers in nothing but tragedy. The current popular designation for movies such as this glossy Michelle Pfeiffer  Jessica Lange melodrama is chick flicks. Covering all the dirt in the life of a welltodo Iowa farming clan A Thousand Acres unravels as a soap opera about anguish incest insanity adultery and cancer clearly qualifying this Touchstone Pictures release as a threehandkerchief extravaganza. Moviegoers not familiar with Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel may prove less demanding than their more exacting literary counterparts. Unsavory as most of Acres is Proof director Jocelyn Moorhouse and Portrait of a Lady scenarist Laura Jones have exercised considerable artistic restraint and good taste in their depiction of the events.Set in Iowa in 1979 A Thousand Acres introduces us to Larry Cook Jason Robards the Cook clan patriarch. He owns a thousand acres of free and clear land. Larry loves to tell the story about how his ancestors put in a drainage system and converted swamp land into profitable farm acreage. Larry stands tall in the eyes of the community and has a say in all major decisions. The Larry Cook character resembles Shakespeare's King Lear which essentially was the idea behind Smiley's novel. Larry's wife died from cancer but he has three daughters Rose Michelle Pfeiffer Ginny Jessica Lange and the youngest Carolina Jennifer Jason Leigh. Rose and Ginny are married Rose to Pete Lewis Kevin Anderson and Ginny to Ty Keith Carradine. The older sisters have stayed at home living in houses on either side of their father's house. Rose is raising two girls but cancer has forced her to have a mastectomy. The only nudity occurs in the scene in the examination room when we are shown Pfeiffer's face grafted onto someone else's body.Carolina differs from her elder sisters. While they dress casually and are homemakers Carolina is an attorney who wear her hair pulled back severely into a bun. She isn't married at the start of the movie and her respect for Larry cannot match that of her sisters. So when Larry in an act of overwhelming generosity decides to form a corporation and give equal shares to everybody Carolina balks at the offer. Furious Larry all but disowns her and nothing that the sisters can do will change Carolina's mind. Larry makes his relatives a gift of the farm because he feels that the inheritance tax would eat them alive. Initially A Thousand Acres gets off to a happy start. Before fadeout however Moorhouse and Jones sling every bit of dirt they can muster.We learn that Larry has feel of clay and that Rose and Ginny differ in their temperament. While Rose is consumed by her own sense of rage Ginny insulates herself from the shadowy past. The movie's time frame encompasses a pivotal and devastating turning point in the Cook clan. Get those handkerchiefs ready. The two elder Cook sisters square off against Carolina. Carolina accuses them of duping Larry out of his farm. The people in town are convinced that both Rose and Ginny cheated their father too. Since Larry signed over the farm he has either confined himself to his mansion like a shutin or he drives around recklessly and gets drunk. Whatever generosity that he had expressed at the beginning Larry converts now into hate fear and rage toward his two daughters. In an afterdark tornado sequence Larry raves insanely and calls his daughters harlots. Eventually the ugly truth leaks out and the Cook clan collapses like a house of cards. As Ginny Lange wears a glazedeyed look and weaves a pattern of anxiety with her expressive hands. Ginny has spent her entire life repressing the truth and her nervous gestures and posture capture this evasion. Lange's performance is very mannered and the matronly wardrobe that her frumpy character wears dilutes Lange's sensuous Hollywood persona. She has landed the choice role in Acres. Ginny is the only character that expands and changes. Lange is such a seasoned performer that she makes all of this fidgeting seem completely natural. As Rose Pfeiffer gets to fulminate and fire off at those people that she hates. Pfeiffer has clearly gotten the flashy role and she wrings every morsel of thespian disgust out of it. Rose's revulsion for her father is almost as destructive as the cancer she fears will engulf her and she is not more charitable to her scummy insensitive husband. Pfeiffer's character could easily qualify as the film's villain though that role belong to Jason Robards' guilty patriarch.Ideally cast as the father Robards plays a parent whose paternal instincts have grown pretty base. Indeed the script makes little mention of Larry's crisis but Robards lets it erupt in a hypnotic performance that is all the more evocative considering his brief appearance on the screen. His scene on the witness stand in court reveals how a talented actor can present character without having to spell it out. This style of grim acting comes easily to Robards who legendary reputation in the American theatre derives from his tortured Eugene O'Neil characters. Robards actually resembles one of Jurassic Park's predatory TRex dinosaurs with his sunken eyes sullen expressions and occupational sneer. The performances alone are worth the price of admission. Nobody is miscast. Keith Carradine's famer husband is probably the only straightforward character who emerges from these disasters with his honesty intact. Pfeiffer and Lange endow their performances with a sisterly blend. Nevertheless as sisters they remain inevitably different. By the time the movie concludes these sisters have confessed what they could never have yielded in less strenuous circumstances.Director Jocelyn Moorhouse whose credits include How to Make an American Quilt has crafted an elegiac saga of a family in disintegration. Definitely not a feelgood movie A Thousand Acres' is rather an emotional lobotomy that will leave you feeling sad but relieved.".

The only nudity occurs in the scene in the examination room when we are shown Pfeiffer's face grafted onto someone else's body.Carolina differs from her elder sisters. While they dress casually and are homemakers Carolina is an attorney who wear her hair pulled back severely into a bun. She isn't married at the start of the movie and her respect for Larry cannot match that of her sisters. So when Larry in an act of overwhelming generosity decides to form a corporation and give equal shares to everybody Carolina balks at the offer. Furious Larry all but disowns her and nothing that the sisters can do will change Carolina's mind. Larry makes his relatives a gift of the farm because he feels that the inheritance tax would eat them alive. Initially A Thousand Acres gets off to a happy start. Before fadeout however Moorhouse and Jones sling every bit of dirt they can muster.We learn that Larry has feel of clay and that Rose and Ginny differ in their temperament. While Rose is consumed by her own sense of rage Ginny insulates herself from the shadowy past. The movie's time frame encompasses a pivotal and devastating turning point in the Cook clan. Get those handkerchiefs ready. The two elder Cook sisters square off against Carolina. Carolina accuses them of duping Larry out of his farm. The people in town are convinced that both Rose and Ginny cheated their father too. Since Larry signed over the farm he has either confined himself to his mansion like a shutin or he drives around recklessly and gets drunk. Whatever generosity that he had expressed at the beginning Larry converts now into hate fear and rage toward his two daughters. In an afterdark tornado sequence Larry raves insanely and calls his daughters harlots. Eventually the ugly truth leaks out and the Cook clan collapses like a house of cards. As Ginny Lange wears a glazedeyed look and weaves a pattern of anxiety with her expressive hands. Ginny has spent her entire life repressing the truth and her nervous gestures and posture capture this evasion. Lange's performance is very mannered and the matronly wardrobe that her frumpy character wears dilutes Lange's sensuous Hollywood persona. She has landed the choice role in Acres. Ginny is the only character that expands and changes. Lange is such a seasoned performer that she makes all of this fidgeting seem completely natural. As Rose Pfeiffer gets to fulminate and fire off at those people that she hates. Pfeiffer has clearly gotten the flashy role and she wrings every morsel of thespian disgust out of it. Rose's revulsion for her father is almost as destructive as the cancer she fears will engulf her and she is not more charitable to her scummy insensitive husband. Pfeiffer's character could easily qualify as the film's villain though that role belong to Jason Robards' guilty patriarch.Ideally cast as the father Robards plays a parent whose paternal instincts have grown pretty base. Indeed the script makes little mention of Larry's crisis but Robards lets it erupt in a hypnotic performance that is all the more evocative considering his brief appearance on the screen. His scene on the witness stand in court reveals how a talented actor can present character without having to spell it out. This style of grim acting comes easily to Robards who legendary reputation in the American theatre derives from his tortured Eugene O'Neil characters. Robards actually resembles one of Jurassic Park's predatory TRex dinosaurs with his sunken eyes sullen expressions and occupational sneer. The performances alone are worth the price of admission. Nobody is miscast. Keith Carradine's famer husband is probably the only straightforward character who emerges from these disasters with his honesty intact. Pfeiffer and Lange endow their performances with a sisterly blend. Nevertheless as sisters they remain inevitably different. By the time the movie concludes these sisters have confessed what they could never have yielded in less strenuous circumstances.Director Jocelyn Moorhouse whose credits include How to Make an American Quilt has crafted an elegiac saga of a family in disintegration. Definitely not a feelgood movie A Thousand Acres' is rather an emotional lobotomy that will leave you feeling sad but relieved.";

The farm families of Iowa are so intimately interrelated as they are in the area of Indiana where I grew up in the 40's and 50's that I immediately recognized the backstories and motives behind the characters. Perhaps Jane Smiley did mean for us to see beyond the superficial into the world these people had to live but viewers are so caught up in the Hollywood aura of the individual actors that they miss a rich layout of a lifestyle that exists less and less as each decade passes.

	schema:reviewBody "The two primary questions I use in evaluating a film are Is it a story worth telling? and is it a story well told? When I apply these questions to Jocelyn Morehouse's A Thousand Acres adapted from the novel by Jane Smiley the answers are yes yes and no. The basic story is a loose adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear. This story provides fertile soil for a tragic but compelling story as told in Jane Smiley's novel as she moves the setting of the story to the cornfields of Iowa. This revisionist King Lear has an aging farmer played by twotime Oscar winner Jason Robards proposing to divide his farm among his three daughters as a way of minimizing the costs of inheritance taxes. The youngest daughter expresses some reservations and is immediately cut out of the partnership. When the farm is divided between the other two daughters the stage is set for a tragedy of epic proportions. As the story unfolds the family relations are strained and broken by greed betrayal death abuse miscommunication and ghosts from the past. When Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer read Jane Smiley's novel they purchased the screen rights. Women are at the center of this project from beginning to end. This is actually somewhat refreshing since Hollywood is not known for sensitivity in its portrayal of females or in its understanding of female viewpoints. Unfortunately this has led some to dismiss the film as a chick flick. While there are no male characters in the film for whom we feel much compassion or sympathy the film is really about Ginny as played by Jessica Lange. If the viewer follows the dramatic arc of this character it is easier to find the heart of this film.Finding the heart of the film appears to be a problem. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of a possible four Owen Glieberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a letter grade of F. Othersmyself includedliked it a bit better than that.The film is clearly not without its problems. Film adaptations are difficult because richly textured stories must be trimmed and abridged to fit a twohour time span for the typical film. Most of the criticisms of A Thousand Acres revolve around underdeveloped characters subplots left hanging and unclear story lines. I suspect some of this is the result of commercial tampering and trimming by the producers. Some of the blame clearly goes to director Jocelyn Morehouse who doesn't do enough to help us care about some of the characters. When tragedy strikes it is almost as if we are reading about strangers in a newspaper.The performances by Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer Pfeiffer plays the second sister Rose are so compelling that the film remains engaging in spite of its flaws. Jessica Lange gives what may be the performance of her already Oscarrich career Tootsie and Blue Sky. This is a different kind of role for Pfeiffer and she clearly rises to the occasion. A Thousand Acres is worth seeing if you are interested in a good story that comes close to being well told.".

In 1984 when seeing TRS for the first time I thought The folks who made this obviously saw Toward the Unknown and copied some of its style especially in the scenes where aircraft are shown from above climbing towards the camera with the desert in the background. One reviewer refers to the fictitious bomber in the movie. The bomber was quite real being the XB51 which was tested but never adopted for service. I've always been a fan of the X series of rocket planes and the pilots who flew them and the inclusion of the beautiful dartlike Bell X2 in this film is one of its highlights for me. About fifteen years ago I had a taped from TV copy of this movie that I got off of TBS or TNT but it is long since bit the dust. I'd dearly love to have it on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film the year it came out in theaters and again two years later at my school. It has always been dear to me. Two years ago I bought a video of it in the original boxfrom a friend. We are about the same age and have been crazy about airplanes most of our lives. What to say about this film 1The cinematography is great and 2the music is enjoyable. 3Bill Holden is really good in this film but 4sexy Virginia Leith takes your breath away in several scenes especially if you're a 100 guy. If you are interested in this film it will probably have something to do with a consuming interest in aviation in the 1950's. If that is true then there are several things to watch for 1 The airplane in which Lloyd Nolan survives a desert crash is the hulk of the only Convair XF91 ever built to completion. The XF91 interceptor would have been something else with a more power. It was buikt as a light ewight aircraft and with enough power it would have been a precursor of the Mirage. All of the research from the XF91 it was incorporated in the development of the later F102 Delta Dagger and F106 Delta Dart interceptors. 2 The large threeengined jet aircraft called the Gilbert ? was actually the prototype of the Martin XB51 Jet BomberAttack aircraft. The XB51 was tragically underpowered. With that imopediment the aircraft still met or exceeded almost all of the requirements set for it by USAF. But our Government and several other contractors was against it. Years later in Tulsa in the 1960's I heard that North American Aviation in Los Angeles spent big bucks with Lobbyists in Washington to have the plane and its production cancelled. So instead of buying the B51 the US Government incredibly chose the British Canberra aircraft which served the USAF well as the B57 throughout the fifties and through Vietnam. However with more powerful engines the B51 would have been the better plane. 3 The Convair T29 transport was a workhorse for USAF and was flown into the 1970's. A friend who served in USAF at the time to me that in 1968 two of these aircraft were modified by USAF as Special Projects aircraft for use over Vietnam and Laos in foul weather. If you like this film you need to see 1 Strategic Air Command 2Men of the Fighting Lady 3 Sabre Jet 4 Dragonfly Squadron evidently not available on video and 5 The Bridges at TokoRi. Happy Contrails.....".

Two years ago I bought a video of it in the original boxfrom a friend. We are about the same age and have been crazy about airplanes most of our lives. What to say about this film 1The cinematography is great and 2the music is enjoyable. 3Bill Holden is really good in this film but 4sexy Virginia Leith takes your breath away in several scenes especially if you're a 100 guy. If you are interested in this film it will probably have something to do with a consuming interest in aviation in the 1950's. If that is true then there are several things to watch for 1 The airplane in which Lloyd Nolan survives a desert crash is the hulk of the only Convair XF91 ever built to completion. The XF91 interceptor would have been something else with a more power. It was buikt as a light ewight aircraft and with enough power it would have been a precursor of the Mirage. All of the research from the XF91 it was incorporated in the development of the later F102 Delta Dagger and F106 Delta Dart interceptors. 2 The large threeengined jet aircraft called the Gilbert ? was actually the prototype of the Martin XB51 Jet BomberAttack aircraft. The XB51 was tragically underpowered. With that imopediment the aircraft still met or exceeded almost all of the requirements set for it by USAF. But our Government and several other contractors was against it. Years later in Tulsa in the 1960's I heard that North American Aviation in Los Angeles spent big bucks with Lobbyists in Washington to have the plane and its production cancelled. So instead of buying the B51 the US Government incredibly chose the British Canberra aircraft which served the USAF well as the B57 throughout the fifties and through Vietnam. However with more powerful engines the B51 would have been the better plane. 3 The Convair T29 transport was a workhorse for USAF and was flown into the 1970's. A friend who served in USAF at the time to me that in 1968 two of these aircraft were modified by USAF as Special Projects aircraft for use over Vietnam and Laos in foul weather. If you like this film you need to see 1 Strategic Air Command 2Men of the Fighting Lady 3 Sabre Jet 4 Dragonfly Squadron evidently not available on video and 5 The Bridges at TokoRi. Happy Contrails.....";

The rest of the actors also deliver a good performance and the movies maintains a good enough pace to keep it interesting.If you enjoy watching entertaining movies with a military and historical flavor then this movie will definitely interest you. The glimpse into America's early attempts at faster than sound flight are good and the flight sequences are entertaining enough to hold your attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "Toward the Unknown 1956In some ways this is fascinating stuffyou get a glimpse of mid50s American military aeronautics and a specific mention and microglimpse of the rocket efforts marking early space technology. William Holden plays a troubled test pilot who leads us through the different planes and testing efforts via his own return and rise through the system. It's not bad.However.You can't quite call this a formula filmmaybe a genre film if there is a genre called test pilots in troublebut there is a canned quality to this whole thing that holds it back unreasonably. There is the woman from his past who loves him but also has an affair going with the general the likable Lloyd Nolan on the base Edwards Air Force Base. There are the competing test pilots all good actors known mostly for television. It makes for a good group that is forced into a thin plot about rivalry and camaraderie. The really best part of the plot and the reason I watched the movie at first is that Holden is a man who was in a Korean War prison camp where he was abused and tortured and brainwashed. It's this last thing that was so talked about at the time and which was used to make some really terrific movies like The Manchurian Candidate and I wanted to see where it would go here. Well a heads up it goes nowhere. His prison camp experience causes a pivotal scene in the movie on the base but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with brainwashing.Too bad on that.Holden by this point in his career is not the leading man he once was though this is just five years after his terrific comeback year with Union Station and Sunset Blvd. But he's really good holding his scenes together with the woman Virginia Leith who has the eyes blue and lips red to pop on the WarnerColor screen but who can't act very well.Obviously if you like airplanes and the air force this is a movie to definitely see. Some great footage of test aircraft in flight real footage from the military. And of course the whole supersonic flying experiments were a big deal at the time. If all of this seems a bore and too historical for a good movie you're partly right. It's not a great plot or drama. But it's not a terrible movie by any means. Director Mervyn LeRoy rightfully a legend by now and cinematographer Harold Rossen equally a legend together made sure that it held water and survives it's own flaws very well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before beginning this review of a good testpilot flick I went through all those previously posted to see if anyone noticed what I noticed. Surprisingly no one did surprisingly because so many aviation and Air Force buffs enjoyed Toward the Unknown. That's not meant to be an indictment because I missed it on my first viewing when admittedly I was not paying close attention. My second viewing was to judge the film and see if it is worth saving to DVR. It certainly is. A few comments first before I reveal the teaser hinted at in my openingMost of the reviews and their comments are valuable concerning the aviation aspects of the film. Historical and background aspects such as the Bud Mahurin Frank Everest and Al Boyd connections are valid without my trying to improve on them. The setups perspectives and costuming used here by Mervyn LeRoy influenced The Right Stuff without a doubt.Likewise valid are comments on the performances. I fall into the camp that finds Virginia Leith a desirable adult woman but at best an average actressher looks make me wish otherwise. William Holden delivers mainly a rehash of Harry Brubaker of The Bridges at TokoRi. Lloyd Nolan is well Lloyd Nolan cast because of his age and affability. That's okay with me since I identified with him much more than Holden particularly in the love triangle plot line. Jim Garner is barely a blip on the screenone wishes his role was more like Mike Bailey of Sayonara. Of the rest Charles McGraw's reprise of his performance in TokoRi was the best while Murray Hamilton Paul Fix and L.Q. Jones delivered solid performances of the roles they were typically typecast in.I can't let one boneheaded review pass without comment though. That bad actor Holden managed to take home a wellearned Oscar in his career Leith is hardly quite plain and the way in which Lincoln Bond was thought to have betrayed his country was very much specified. Pay more attention to the dialog and less to your own snobbish ego.That leads to my contribution. Those of you who are Air Force film buffs will want to go back and watch for Beirne Lay's numerous references to his Twelve O'Clock High. At least one scene when Gen Shelby tries to cajole Banner into moving up to ARDC headquarters is a virtual replay of an identical scene between Millard Mitchell and Gregory Peck in Twelve O'Clock High. From there the scenes become easier to spot among others Davenport warning Savage Your failure will be bigger than mine ever was Joe Cobb's death in combat I kept waiting for Holden to yell Jump you guys jump so close was the dialog when Joe Craven was in trouble and Jesse Bishop's wanting a transfer out of the Air Force echoed in Bond's wanting to resign. Banner's physical problems that suggest he might be forced to give up flying are from another Lay opus Strategic Air Command made the year before.There are more and this is not meant as a criticism. The recycling of plot devices to construct archetypal themes is as old as drama itself. Beyond Generals Banner and Shelby Lay's use of counterparts from Twelve O'Clock High in his screenplay for Toward the Unknown is fuzzier unless you consider that the film might be a retelling from Gately's perspective rather than Savage's. Incidents are assigned to characters where they best advance Lay's points not for exact matchups to the prior film. But it's fun spotting them. Tell Ted to stick to reviews of undying brains and watch this movie again.".

Cuddly Nigel Bruce is MacMurray's associate  gruff  grumbly but with a heart of gold.Special mention should be made of sevenyearold Spanky McFarland who plays Miss Sidney's little brother. Already the star of numerous OUR GANG comedies the tiny tyke here displays the talent that placed him in the front rank of child movie stars. Precocious  poignant Spanky's character is quite unforgettable.Fred Stone  Robert Barrat play the heads of the two feuding clans one gentle  the other fierce. Movie mavens will recognize Clara Blandick as a frightened landlady and Samuel S.

The tune for the chorus of The Trail Of The Lonesome Pine' by Ballard MacDonald  Harry Carroll can be briefly heard during the opening credits viewers will need to watch Laurel  Hardy's WAY OUT WEST 1937 to hear this fine old song actually sung.Famous as the first outdoor film produced in full Technicolor THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE benefits greatly from its location filming near Cedar Lake in California's San Bernardino Mountains.".

There were three silent films made from this novel by John Fox Jr. including one done in 1916 by Cecil B. DeMille.It's the story of a couple of Appalachian Mountain families who've had a decades old feud in which no one can quite recall how it all got started but they sure do remember the latest outrage by the other crowd. There's a great temptation to treat this all humorously and it certainly has been done I can recall Abbott and Costello's Comin' Round the Mountain with the same plot premise. But whole people's and whole nations act this way who are we to judge the Tollivers and Falins of this story.Sylvia Sidney and Henry Fonda are two Tolliver cousins kissing cousins as they say in the mountains distant enough to contemplate marriage. Into the picture comes railroad man Fred MacMurray who wants to build a railroad through the properties of both families. He interests Sylvia who starts to see that there is a whole world away from her family and their feud.Of course when her little brother is killed the whole ugly business starts up again and it leaves tragedy again in both families.The Trail of the Lonesome Pine has its place in film history as the first outdoor as opposed to studio film shot in three strip technicolor. Color which is now standard was a big gimmick back in the day and Paramount raked in good box office.Fuzzy Knight plays another rustic character kind of a Tolliver satellite and he sings a couple of songs written for the film by Louis Alter and Sidney Mitchell Twilight on the Trail and A Melody from the Sky. The latter got an Academy Award nomination for Best Song losing to The Way You Look Tonight. The former however got a recording by Bing Crosby. This is a perfect example of the connection of film and radio and the recording industry. Bing was Paramount's number one box office attraction and the Paramount executives no doubt prevailed on him to record the song and sing it on his brand new Kraft Music Hall Radio Show in the interest of publicizing The Trail of the Lonesome Pine. Fred MacMurray and Sylvia Sidney were also with Paramount at the time and Henry Fonda was at that time under contract to producer Walter Wanger who filmed this story. Those were the days way before agents and stars being their own producers. Such cozy arrangements as these were more easily done then.This last to date version of The Trail of the Lonesome Pine probably is too old fashioned for a remake. Still I think today's audiences might still enjoy it.".

	schema:headline " A landmark Technicolor film that is still effective.";
	schema:reviewBody "THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE 1936 is a landmark color film of considerable dramatic power that has been neglected in Hollywood history. It was the second fulllength feature to be produced in the newlydeveloped 3 strip Technicolor process. The first Technicolor feature BECKY SHARP had opened the previous year 1935 but did not find audience favor. There is strong evidence to suggest that THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE was the film that really popularized color.Aside from the superb color photography the film has much to recommend it. There are very strong performances particularly that of Sylvia Sidney as the backwoods mountain girl  a very convincing portrayal. She is supported by two handsome newcomers Henry Fonda and Fred MacMurray plus veterans such as Fred Stone Beulah Bondi and Spanky MacFarland. The story line is very compelling and there is the strong direction of Henry Hathaway LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER KISS OF DEATH TRUE GRIT. In its original release audiences reportedly burst into applause while viewing some of the color scenes. The film was a box office smash for Paramount playing to packed houses in both large and small towns. This is well documented. It remains compelling entertainment today.

	onyx:emotionText "THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE 1936 is a landmark color film of considerable dramatic power that has been neglected in Hollywood history. It was the second fulllength feature to be produced in the newlydeveloped 3 strip Technicolor process. The first Technicolor feature BECKY SHARP had opened the previous year 1935 but did not find audience favor. There is strong evidence to suggest that THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE was the film that really popularized color.Aside from the superb color photography the film has much to recommend it. There are very strong performances particularly that of Sylvia Sidney as the backwoods mountain girl  a very convincing portrayal. She is supported by two handsome newcomers Henry Fonda and Fred MacMurray plus veterans such as Fred Stone Beulah Bondi and Spanky MacFarland. The story line is very compelling and there is the strong direction of Henry Hathaway LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER KISS OF DEATH TRUE GRIT. In its original release audiences reportedly burst into applause while viewing some of the color scenes. The film was a box office smash for Paramount playing to packed houses in both large and small towns. This is well documented. It remains compelling entertainment today. The highquality color photography was very much in evidence in the VHS tape that MCA released in the Nineties. It is to be hoped that the same high quality will be seen in the projected 2009 DVD release of this beloved film.";

	schema:reviewBody "The movie's an affecting tale of feuding backwoods families who must also make adjustments to encroaching modern world. I was expecting a RomeoJuliet situation with the families but that's surprisingly not the case. Instead June Sidney has to decide between her cousin Dave Fonda and outsider Hale MacMurray. Tradition favors Dave but her heart favors Hale. At the same time railroad developers are crossing land owned by each family and neither the Tollivers nor the Falins wants to accommodate their hereditary enemy. They'd rather shoot each other if they get the chance. And who knows how the enmity started except now it's part of both families' tradition. If the movie's flawed it's with the use of of popular backwoods stereotypes.Apparently this was the first outdoor Technicolor feature IMDB but you'd never know it. Visually the film is quite striking with a lot of beautiful outdoor compositions. Also you'd never guess these were filmed just 35miles east of LA in the San Bernardino mountains. The acting too is firstratea soulful Sydney an ornery Fonda and an underrated MacMurray. Then there's Sherlock Holmes' favorite Dr. Watson Nigel Bruce in a noncomedic role. Needless to say that took some adjustment for this old Sherlock fan. In fact there're a couple other unexpected cast members as well Little Rascal Spanky McFarland and comedic Fuzzy Knight. And of course mustn't forget everyone's favorite hardscrabble mom Beulah Bondi as the longsuffering ma Tolliver.I like the way the movie works the culture clash between tradition and modernity into the plot. The railroad company pays big money for land use and that along with a railway to service the expected coal deposits is bringing the backwoods into the modern age as June's evolution shows. Of course not everyone's supportive of change particularly dad Tolliver Stone. The movie has some uncommonly poignant moments especially that final sequence which conveys an extraordinary emotional power. As a kid I recall bawling at it and even now as a geezer it brought a tear to the eye. As I see it Fuzzy and his dog are mourning not only friends but the passing of a simpler way of life.All in all the movie is surprisingly good with a strong story commanding visuals and a thoughtful subtext. So don't pass it up because of a relative obscurity.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Fox Jr.'s novel The Trail of the Lonesome Pine was an enormous best seller in the early years of the 20th Century and was made into a movie several times but I think this was the last version way back in 1936. The fact that it was made 4 times I believe within a little over 25 years of the book's publishing date and hasn't been redone in the almost 80 years since would seem to indicate that the story is dated. Also that this once very popular novel is not read anymore.Well actually I read it and I think it still holds up well. It's an affecting piece of fiction very well written but there's one big problem with it for modern audiences. The main relationship in the story is a close friendship between a grown up man and a young hillbilly girl. I'm not quite sure what the girl's age is at the beginning of the story but I'm guessing it's around 12 years old. You could tell such a story innocently in 1908 but you can't now. It would simply be impossible. And you couldn't film it as it's written in the book. In the book the relationship is completely innocent without a hint of anything sinister but modern audiences would read a sinister motive behind every action of the story's hero.The film however is actually nothing like the book. The filmmakers take the names of the characters and the setting and situation of the book and make a completely different story out of it. I'm sure this is highly irritating to those who love the book if anyone still does but it doesn't ruin the movie at least not for me. Maybe because I saw the movie before I read the book. I look at them as two completely different entities that happen to share superficial similarities.In the film the girl is played by Sylvia Sidney who is certifiably an adult from the beginning. This not only changes the story but eliminates anything sinister modern audiences might find in her friendship and later romance with the hero played by Fred MacMurray. Both these roles would seem oddly cast. Sylvia Sidney a native of the Bronx is hard to imagine as anything other than the city girl which she usually played in films like Dead End or Street Scene or City Streets. Yet ignoring what you know of her usual roles and your expectations based on this knowledge she does a good job in the part. Same goes with MacMurray. This was early in his career before he had become known as a light comedian and occasional heel. His character actually has a lot less to do in the movie than in the book and MacMurray does well with what he has.I'm not a Henry Fonda fan finding him often preachy  whiny but as this was early in his career before he made films a political platform I thought he did very well with his part and made what was a secondary character in the book really the male lead in the picture. But his character is nothing like the samenamed character in the book who is younger meaner ignorant inarticulate almost a villain. The supporting cast was very good. Robert Barrat one of my favorite character actors who almost always had very small parts but always made them pay off is terrific in a couple of short scenes. Same goes with Alan Baxter. Spanky from Our Gang has a big part in the picture and it's peculiar to see him playing serious but he pulls it off OK. Also from the Our Gang angle I could swear one of the other hillbilly kids is Mary Ann Jackson. She is in a couple of very brief shots and you'll miss her if you don't look quick. She is not listed in the cast nor is this film listed in her filmography. if it's not her it's a girl who looks exactly like her and there couldn't be two faces like that! Also must give a mention to famous vaudevillian Fred Stone as head of one of the feuding hillbilly clans. Stone on stage was known as a comedian and eccentric dancer but in pictures he seemed always cast as in this film as a putupon old man carrying heavy burdens and on the edge of tragedy for example Alice Adams. He acts his part well and even gets to do a stunt with a wagon wheel that called on his old time dexterity as a physical comedian.It's sentimental but without being hokey. The color is fantastic for what was really an experimental film. I recommend it but don't expect it to be anything like the book.".

While it had stars like Fred MacMurray Henry Fonda and Sylvia Sidney the main reason I was interested in this movie was because of one Spanky McFarland who at the time was still a member of Our Gang. This was a compelling story of a couple of feuding families and one outsider played by MacMurray who's trying to build a railroad around both respective groups' areas. There's also a romantic rivalry between Fonda and MacMurray for Sidney. Also appearing were Beulah Bondi Nigel Bruce and Samuel Hinds as the Sheriff. If anyone is familiar with me they know my favorite movie is It's a Wonderful Life and I like noting actors in that movie in other films like Bondi and Hinds who were married in the latter Then there's Fuzzy Knight who's a charmer as something of a Greek chorus singing songs like Twlight on the Trail and the Oscarnominated A Melody from the Sky. Incidentally while Knight sings the latter Fonda whistles and Spanky hums and this was a couple of years before Spanky's Our Gang costar Alfalfa sung part of this tune in the short The Little Ranger which McFarland doesn't appear in. Anyway this was a fine showcase for the Technicolor photography as kudos to director Henry Hathaway for making every scene count as this was a most entertaining drama with a couple of touching though tragic scenes at the end. So on that note I highly recommend The Trail of the Lonesome Pine.".

	schema:headline " Trail of vendetta tears truce and hope among mountain folk";
	schema:reviewBody "First I would like to note the striking similarities of the plot of this film with that of the later The Big Country western. Both dealt with a running feud between two extended families involving illiterate backwoodsmen near the border of VA and KY in the present film and two cattleranching families in the Wild West in the other film. Although not hinted in either filmprobably to avoid offending significant portions of audiences one of the families had an Irishderived name while the other had an English or Scottishderived name suggesting that ethnic and religious bigotry was the root of their traditional hatred for each other. In each film the story dealt mainly with the nonIrish family while the Irish family is characterized as the more uncouth. The English or Scottish family is the recipient of an enlightened outsider who becomes romantically involved with the most eligible daughter of the clan. The outsider finally forces the feuding families to cooperate to some degreeover water rights in one case and over building a railway to carry out coal in the present case and to end their vendetta cultures but not until after further bloodshed instigated by the outsider's presence.A young Henry Fonda plays the tragic Dave Toliver who near the beginning of the film is laying down with a Falin bullet in his shoulder and ends the film laying down with another Falin bullet or two in him.Through most of the film he represents a young generation of hotheads who want to continue their life of backwoods primitiveness and clan feuding. In contrast coal mining engineer Jack HaleFred MacMurray represents the enlightened outside world. He wants to open coal mines and build a railroad to take it out on lands of both clans requiring the grudging cooperation of the clans. At first most don't like it but eventually both families sign an agreement despite the continued disapproval of some. Meanwhile Hale interests Dave's cute girlfriend June ToliverSylvia Sydney in getting an education in far off Louisville. Clearly she is gradually warming up to him as a possible alternative to Dave. Also her much younger brother BuddieSpanky MacFarland is much interested in the machinery involved in building the railway and announces he wants to become an engineer. Tragically someonepresumably a Falin blows up the steam shovel he is playing on. Was this meant as sabotage? murder? or both? Everyone emphasizes the murder aspect which leads to a new round of threats and shootings. Hale feels indirectly responsible. He Dave and a devastated June vacillate as to whether to go shoot some Falins in retaliation. The elderly sheriff of the nearby village of Gaptown and MelissaBeulah Bondi Daves mother voice their strong advice that the young folk not go hunting Falins to shoot. The dramatic last 15 minutes of the film brings some resolution to the major plot conflicts but I was disappointed with the finale scene. Strangely despite occasional songs sung by the eccentric TaterFuzzy Knight the established song Trail of the Lonesome Pine is barely included as one of several background pieces in the opening credits. The lyrics begin 'In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia'. Well the story location as well as the officially designated Trail of the Lonesome Pine are quite west of the actual Blue Ridge Mountains which form the easternmost significant mountain range along the southern Appalachians. There's no coal in those mountains. Their rocks are geologically much more related to those of the Piedmont to the east than to the sedimentary rocks found on the Appalachian Plateau where this story takes place as well as those in the intervening Valley and Ridge geographical region.Evidently the lyricist for this song was ignorant of or didn't care about the actual geographic regions of SW Virginia! Thus the song in the film When it's Twilight on the Trail is perhaps a more appropriate theme song.You may find the attitude of the Gaptown sheriff toward the killings and sabotage disturbing. Along with Melissa he felt that attempts to retaliate against the Falins for Buddie's death by killing them or arrests would merely provoke more violence. This is an ageold problem with no simple answer than works out well in all situations. It is still quite relevant in the US today to say nothing of the rest of the world especially as relates to organized criminal gangs domestic disputes and violence and to growing and trafficking illegal drugs. Unfortunately governments don't recognize private wars as being legally equivalent to wars waged by governments. Thus killers and avengers are treated alike as murderers not as heroes or victims. Our prisons are filled with criminal gang members who continue their wars there. The sheriff clearly didn't agree with this policy.A gorgeous Paramount Technicolor production reportedly the first threestrip outdoor Technicolor film.".

I was disappointed after all that wait.Sylvia Sidney and Fred MacMurray were terribly miscast as the leads June and Jack Fred more so than Sylvia. Henry Fonda was very good as Dave although his lines were hokey. The script was not true to the book at all that was the main problem. All the protective tenderness the lead male Jack felt for the girl June so beautifully portrayed in the novel was totally missing in Fred MacMurray's performance. And then to top it off they had little Spanky from the Our Gang series in it as the little brother of June his chubby face and coy demeanor were distractions from the main action of the story. The songs that were sung were annoying too had no place in the story. It would have been better if they had spent money on a better musical soundtrack without characters singing all the time especially in dramatic scenes. What were they thinking? no doubt of sheet music sales. Some outdoor scenes were beautiful filmed in color but that alone cannot hold the viewer's interest in the movie. Even the significance and symbolism of the Pine Tree in June and Jack's relationship wasn't portrayed in the film as it should have been.Anyway my advice here is to skip the film and just read the book and enjoy it. Since this story is in the public domain it could really be updated today and make a nice film. Maybe someday some studio or independent filmmaker will consider it. There were 4 silent versions and an animated version made prior to this film so obviously the story is a classic one that can be enjoyed by new generations if told well and with sensitivity and faithfulness to the book by John Fox.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is really a very subtle literate story. Nothing hits you over the head there's nothing to win or lose at the end it's just characters and events unfolding and interacting within a languid pace. It's really a beautiful film both in scenery sentiment and depth of feeling.If you've ever visited Istanbul you should see this film. I expected to see the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque right off but you never see them the film chooses to see Istanbul through the charming back alleys and everyday people. The traditions of the country and the warmth of the people are everpresent in this film. Istanbul itself is like a character here and its special charms are at the center of the story. If you have visited there you will understand why the characters become so captivated.But this film only uses Istanbul and the Hamam as a vehicle for showing its characters ways of finding happiness and tranquility in one's life. The story is much more general and eternal. It shares that quality with literature it is at once about these specific characters and also about everyone everywhere.Here in New York this film is called Steam and is being sold as a major homoerotic experience. It's sad that they have to cheapen this wonderful movie in that way and people going expecting to get their jollies will be woefully disappointed and entirely missing the point.One tends to think of TurkishItalian cinema as not being as technically sophisticated but this film is vary carefully and intelligently written and directed.

	onyx:emotionText "This film is really a very subtle literate story. Nothing hits you over the head there's nothing to win or lose at the end it's just characters and events unfolding and interacting within a languid pace. It's really a beautiful film both in scenery sentiment and depth of feeling.If you've ever visited Istanbul you should see this film. I expected to see the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque right off but you never see them the film chooses to see Istanbul through the charming back alleys and everyday people. The traditions of the country and the warmth of the people are everpresent in this film. Istanbul itself is like a character here and its special charms are at the center of the story. If you have visited there you will understand why the characters become so captivated.But this film only uses Istanbul and the Hamam as a vehicle for showing its characters ways of finding happiness and tranquility in one's life. The story is much more general and eternal. It shares that quality with literature it is at once about these specific characters and also about everyone everywhere.Here in New York this film is called Steam and is being sold as a major homoerotic experience. It's sad that they have to cheapen this wonderful movie in that way and people going expecting to get their jollies will be woefully disappointed and entirely missing the point.One tends to think of TurkishItalian cinema as not being as technically sophisticated but this film is vary carefully and intelligently written and directed. This really is one of those special beautiful movies not as flashy or intense as some but I think I will remember this film for a long time.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first film directed by Ozpetek an Italian director of Turkish origin and it contains all the recurrent issues of his later work. The movie focuses on Francesco a young architect on how his life changes for the better when he is forced to leave Rome to go to Istanbul. There he finds a completely different way to relate to work and other people he discovers the importance of value such as solidarity understanding and family. In the latest part the film have a twist as long as Francesco's wife Marta comes to Istanbul to make him sign the divorce papers. The man is forced to come to term with his older life. The finale comes unexpected Francesco is killed we don't know why probably 'cos he refuses to sell the hamam and Marta instead of leaving takes over the hamam.This film is about happiness and the comparison of two ways of life. On one hand we have a western country where people have all the comforts they need but they are just too busy to enjoy life and other people around them. On the other there is Istanbul with its slowness and the warmth of its people who even if they are poor seem much more serene. There are also Ozpetek's recurrent themes the most important are 1 the gay character. this director always deals with the topic of homosexuality being gay himself even if in this film this is just a collateral issue. In Istanbul Francesco becomes lover of the son of the Hamam caretaker. But this is just a small part of th his growth and their relationship is more suggested than represented. This becomes clear when he finally speaks with his wife about their relationship in Italy their problem was that they were two stress workaholic and unhappy people not that he was gay he doesn't seem to consider himself so 2 the concept of alternative family family is a network of people and feelings that support you and make you feel good. He found a family in Turkey living with the Hamam caretaker's family but he hasn't any in Italy although being married 3 food as a metaphor of the joy of staying together as a tool to welcome other people and strengthen relationships with them hospitality is an important concept in southern cultures. All these themes are just hinted in this movie but they are fully developed in Le fate ignoranti probably his masterpiece. Even if immature I love this film and here you are 3 reasons why it's worth seeing 1 the topic is interesting and well developed 2 Istanbul is well portrayed in a very nontouristic way3for girls Alessandro Gasman is so handsome in this film".

There he finds a completely different way to relate to work and other people he discovers the importance of value such as solidarity understanding and family. In the latest part the film have a twist as long as Francesco's wife Marta comes to Istanbul to make him sign the divorce papers. The man is forced to come to term with his older life. The finale comes unexpected Francesco is killed we don't know why probably 'cos he refuses to sell the hamam and Marta instead of leaving takes over the hamam.This film is about happiness and the comparison of two ways of life. On one hand we have a western country where people have all the comforts they need but they are just too busy to enjoy life and other people around them. On the other there is Istanbul with its slowness and the warmth of its people who even if they are poor seem much more serene. There are also Ozpetek's recurrent themes the most important are 1 the gay character. this director always deals with the topic of homosexuality being gay himself even if in this film this is just a collateral issue. In Istanbul Francesco becomes lover of the son of the Hamam caretaker. But this is just a small part of th his growth and their relationship is more suggested than represented. This becomes clear when he finally speaks with his wife about their relationship in Italy their problem was that they were two stress workaholic and unhappy people not that he was gay he doesn't seem to consider himself so 2 the concept of alternative family family is a network of people and feelings that support you and make you feel good. He found a family in Turkey living with the Hamam caretaker's family but he hasn't any in Italy although being married 3 food as a metaphor of the joy of staying together as a tool to welcome other people and strengthen relationships with them hospitality is an important concept in southern cultures. All these themes are just hinted in this movie but they are fully developed in Le fate ignoranti probably his masterpiece. Even if immature I love this film and here you are 3 reasons why it's worth seeing 1 the topic is interesting and well developed 2 Istanbul is well portrayed in a very nontouristic way3for girls Alessandro Gasman is so handsome in this film";

	schema:reviewBody "Hamam tends to keep one's interest through its presentation rather than its actual content. Nothing much happens of significance but the director has his characters exchanging furtive glances knowing expressions and shoots his scenes in a mysterious manner. The feeling is that something significant is going to happen at any moment it doesn't really until close to the film's end. Indeed the director has taken a pretty lame script and made it appear like a minor suspenser. The characters do not say much of anything important just a lot of small talk and petty attentions. Yet a kind of sensual atmosphere is created by use of the lush color photography and atmospheric Turkish music and scenery. How one enjoys this film will depend on individual tastes. I saw this as part of an international film festival and simply appreciated an opportunity to sample a Turkish contemporary film nicely subtitled.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening scenes of the film had an immediate impact on me. Clever editing as the film cut to and fro between Istambul and Rome with the urgent sounds of noisy Turkish drums was indeed a haunting introduction. Unhappily married Francesco Allesandro Gassman has just received news that his aunt has died and left him some property in Istambul.  Believing it's a house he sets forth to sell it only to find it is a hamamTurkish bath.  As a guest at the house where his aunt once boarded he becomes aware of the differences in the Italian and Turkish cultures..  Annoyed at the bickering and haggling business procedures re the price of the hamam he decides to refurbish it using his skills in interior decorating.  The family and neighbours welcome his decision and include him warmly into their family circle. Francesco becomes attracted to Mehmet the son who happens to be a photographer of some talent. The Turkish people are noted for their hospitality and this is clearly portrayed through the various characters in the film. For me I was completely entranced by the wooden buildings of old Istambul the narrow shaded streets the strange interiors and the steamy hamams now losing their popularity. Into this dreamy atmosphere comes the wife Marta demanding answers for the long delay in the refurbishment.  Marta Francesca d'Aloja seems unable to accept this different culture.  Marta and Francesco start squabbling again and one night Marta discovers that Francesco and Mehmet the son are more than just good friends. I enjoyed everything about this film...the measured pace the exotic location the photography the music the talented acting....a wonderful blend ensuring first class entertainment.  The story begins with a death and ends with a death suggesting that in some way the hamam is cursed.  But the daily life of the Turkish family and the progress of the refurbishment of the hamam is so convincing that we feel in the end that should we go to Istambul we would most likely recognize the hamam and the people who live there. At first I was puzzled about the motive for the knifing and then I remembered the advice given to Francesco Take care....she is a dangerous woman!!".

Then with little warning or rationale from the plot the lead character meets a violent end literally out of nowhere. The male love interest disappears and the cheating wife swoops in to claim the Turkish bath her husband had been restoring.

The male love interest disappears and the cheating wife swoops in to claim the Turkish bath her husband had been restoring. It's pretty obvious this is a tacked on ending to make the film acceptable to the censors and the audience in its country.";

	schema:reviewBody "Despite what many reviews say I really liked this. It may be dated in special effects and be crawling in flaws but it is a generally enjoyable movie. Sean Barker finds a strange alien mechanical looking device that merges with his own body turning him into a cyborglike superhero. When Zoanoids Werewolf like people that can turn into mutants appear and start chasing him down in order to obtain the device Sean uncovers Khronos Corp.'s evil schemes.Fans of the Guyver cartoon and comics may or may not like it. A lot of the best bits from the cartoon's storyline are involved in this movie but are done slightly differently. While the action and Zoanoidsmonsters seem like an adult version of the Power Rangers and some of the tongueincheek gags almost take over the Guyver's story something about the movie is just irresistible. The problem is it's impossible to put your finger on what it is.Reminiscent of a lot of the late 80s to early 90's action comic inspired movies the movie never takes itself too seriously. Weather that's a good or bad thing is your decision. There are times where the comic relief or purposely amusing action scenes can start to become annoying as any fan of The Guyver is obviously looking for some serious action and gore. It does have it's moments in that department however.The movie covers most of the main Guyver story apart from the actual origin of the Guyver. A sequel The Guyver Dark Hero spawned from thisalthough it can be watched on it's own and understood especially if you have seen the cartoon or read the comics which takes The Guyver much more seriously and uncovers the origin of the Guyver whilst at the same time throws constant violent action at you.Casting is good in the means of appearance Mark Hamill as a CIA agent must have boosted the sales of the film and Michael Berryman makes the perfect mutant with his bald head and evil stare but the acting could use some work.Hardcore fans of the cartoon or comics may be iffy about the tongueincheek humor used in this movie but as long as it's not taken too seriously it can be a great movie to watch. The important part is that it FEELS like The Guyver. If you don't want to put up with lots of flaws and comic relief gags then go for The Guyver Dark Hero which is much more similar to the cartoons and comics.".

The movie is in fact actually somewhat based off the anime pretty well. The movie is pretty much the first episode of the anime just tweaked to America and aging the characters and well rushing the end of the anime to the liveaction. Although the budget is under a million dollars the SFX are actually pretty good. Those rubber suits have never looked better! Plus there's a good Jaws parody that results in the death of J.J. Walker!The movie makes me laugh sometimes intentionally and sometimes not but I had fun the while way thru so give a 10!".

It is extremely corny EXTREMELY however the creature designs are actually original and cool and make the Guyver worth watching. The Guyver itself is awesome. The movie does have its moments I am the Guyver though. The main reason I am commenting on this mediocre movie is the presence of Jeffrey Combs. He plays Dr. East and all Reanimator fans will get the joke there. Also Dr. Hill from Reanimator plays the villain once again.

Lisker AKA Guyver 2 in the animemanga series is reduced to a simpering idiot of a zoanoid. And Jimmy 'J.J.' Walker as a zoanoid? What are they thinking?If you are a fan of the Guyver Anime and Manga rent Dark Hero Guyver 2. It's a much much better film and is more truer to the original story. If they make a 3rd one bring in Guyver 3 and Masaki Murakami! This would improve the series!!!".

But there is one distinct problem with this concept translation. This was during the 90s and people weren't sure how seriously to take anime yet a problem which translates into this film which has no idea what kind of tone it's going for. Firstly the positives the fight choreography in this movie is nothing short of fantastic combining martial arts and wirework with really cool powers the look of the Guyver and the Zoanoids is really really well done the music is intense and energetic and the acting ranges from over the top and goofy to good Mark Hamill is in this film as a cop trying to solve the mystery and he is great as always. But the film is completely ruined by it's tone there are two movies going on here a goofy over the top fun film and a serious gritty film the two mesh HORRIBLY and so the film ends up being no fun at all Give it a miss.".

There are tons of awesome transformation effects but the bad thing is we get to see a few frames of them briefly and many times none at all.

	schema:reviewBody "...And that was because I was 12 and hadn't read the original Yoshiki Takaya Manga Biobooster Armor Guyver back then. 1992's The Guyver was the first American adaptation of Takaya's original Japanese work which had already been made into a 12episode OVA on its native soil.The original 12episode OVA condensed much of Takaya's material thus eliminating a lot of the deeper scifi themes and moments for the characters to develop beyond simple comic book caricatures. The 1992 Guyver film boasts some incredible creature effects coollooking monsters and a formidable cast of Bmovie talent but it didn't do much to really further Takaya's reputation in the United States since like the first OVA a lot of themes in the movie were shed and replaced by typical scifi monster movie elements and the camp humor present in most American Bpictures.Perhaps the blame falls on the codirecting team of Screaming Mad George and Steve Wang and screenwriter Jon Purdy. They bring much of the camp of American Bmovies to an amazing piece of Japanese art that was better known for its deep characters chilling nearapocalyptic themes and brilliant scifi narrative not for any stupid camp humor. Of course this undermines the seriousness of and shows an utter lack of respect for Takaya's original material even though I'm not a stickler for accuracy when it comes to adaptations but these sorts of changes really bugged me.The first liveaction film features some of the same basic elements of the story including characters and history but that's about it. In Los Angeles a lab scientist is tracked down and killed by the Chronos Corporation's legion of Zoanoids human mutants that have the ability to transform into monster footsoldiers at will. The scientist had stolen the guyver unit an alien suit of armor from Chronos's lab and had planned on delivering it to CIA agent Max Reed Mark Hamill.Balcus the late David Gale is the head of Chronos and has instructed his Zoanoid henchmen including original The Hills Have Eyes Michael Berryman as Zoanoid chief henchman Lisker and Jimmy Walker as Zoanoid footsoldier Striker the latter of whom provides much of the comic relief to go out and search for the missing Guyver unit by first starting with the scientist's daughter Mizki Vivian Wu. But it has already fallen into the hands of college student Sean Barker Jack Armstrong who accidentally activates the unit after being attacked by gang members and is transformed into an exponentially enhanced mechanized warrior with an awesome array of powers and weapons. Now he must use the Guyver's abilities to fend off Chronos and its legion of evil Zoanoids.While The Guvyer does boast some incredible special effects you can also see some of the attempts at mimicking the mood of thenrecent comic book adaptations like Batman 1989 or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1990 much rather than its own source material. But the camp humor destroys much of what could have been really good about the movie. The acting is pretty poor the dialogue hokey and Bname heavyweights such as Mark Hamill and Jimmy Walker don't really seem to have a lot to do although there is one oddlyplaced comic scene where Striker crashes in on the set of a monster movie and is confronted by scream queen Linnea Quigley they don't call her a scream queen for nothing you know.Better to save the best for this film's 1994 sequel Guyver Dark Hero and the 2005 26episode OVA series both of which are not only better but are more serious more violent and more faithful to the Manga.410".

The acting was below par and even the appearance of Mark Hamill who is NOT in fact the guyver as portrayed on the cover couldn't save this movie from the lunatic director who made the barest nod to the original story or setting.The costumes were good and even some of the fighting was passable but that's where the praise for this movie ends.

For a start the script  I don't know who Jon Purdy is but he's crap  is just TERRIBLE. The relationship between Sean and Mizky is ambiguous stilted and generally unsatisfying while the presence of Sean's aikido instructor at Mizky's home is not explained very well that particular scene is maybe the most poorly written in the film.SPOILERThe plot itself is thin Sean gets guyver  guyver is killed  guyver regenerates and kills villain basically it covers the highlights from the first Guyver book albeit names settings changedwith a flimsy love story stretched across its surface. The acting by and large is poor and overdone  Jack Armstrong as 'Sean' does okay but isn't great Jimmy Walker's character should have been cut from the script Balcus was too silly at times Lisker was the best of the bad guys but overacted when in human form and Mizky? well I can safely say that she is one of the biggest reasons as to why this film sucks. Vivian Wu is a really horrible actress yes I know the dialogue was poor but every time she shouted not spoke a line I thought how much better almost any another actress could have said it  'Liz Hurley' for example!!This film should not have been called GUYVER or MUTRONICS it should have been called HOW TO F UP A DECENT ACTOR'S CAREER the decent actor being the 'star' Mark Hamill. I think that Hamill was screwed by Wang and Mad George  they fronted him as the star of the film which he wasn't and used his name to promote it by showing on the poster that he was the guyver when he only had a secondary part. They followed by killing him off in a hideous and pointless way. Of course the pair of 'directors' did this to show us just how SICK and EVIL Chronos are and how GOOD Wang and George are at showing SICK and EVIL things.

	schema:reviewBody "Without trying to offend anybody I have to agree with another reviewer in that an explanation for the bad reception of this film among the nonSpanish speakers reviewers was exactly that Spanish is not their first language and this is sometimes as another reviewer has pointed out a difficult film to understand if you are not a native speaker. A full understanding of the dialogue would help to clarify some of the bizarre scenes in the film. It might not be the best script written by Rafael Azcona without any doubt one of the best scriptwriters in the history of Spanish cinema but at times it is hilarious. A better grasp of Spanish history and culture would also come quite handy. So what else can you say about Penelope Cruz in the scene where she dances and sings for Goebbels?. As one her shoe is missing she unintentionally imitates Goebbles as she approaches him in a frontal shot who is lame.Jokes on the Spanish fascist are more than just clichs. For example the cuckold Spanish ambassador played by Juan Luis Galiardo and his nymphomaniac wife played by Maria Barranco. And the wisecracking remark made by the profascist Spanish troupe leading man Jorge Sanz wooded by his German counterpart Yo doy todo por mi patria menos mi culo he would give anything for his country except his ass. They are both an amusing pisstaking on fascist patriotic macho culture. This subject of patriotism being a hot issue right now in Spain where the rightwing government of Aznar is endorsing the notion of Patriotismo Constitucional or Constitutional Patriotism developed by the German philosopher Jrgen Habermas. Unashamedly the film upholds the necessity to produce espanoladas. As the film director Blas Fontiveros played by Antonio Resines remarks that the life of a Spanish hero has more relevance to Spanish audiences as they feel more identified than for example Al Capone's. 5 Spanish espanoladas films were in fact made in Nazi Germany. Two starred by Imperio Argentina and another 2 by Estrellita Castro both stars of the cine folclorico espanol.As already remarked by some reviewers the film copies scenes from other films the most obvious being its final sequence which is a rip off of the end of Casablanca but to suggest that it is a carbon copy of such and such a film is pure overstatement and a rather facile critique of the film. Yet its politics are not at all convincing not to say rather nave. The introduction of the Russian Jewish character signals the fall of the film into sentimental humanism and vacuous romantic trifle from where the film does not recover. Nevertheless La Nina de tus Ojos has its charms too and I found it extremely funny. The cast is excellent Penelope Cruz playing an andalusian a role she had already done in Almodovar's  Todo Sobre mi Madre as a prostitute. Resines and Sanz are a surprise as well as Santiago Segura. But special mention deserves Miroslav Tborsk playing Vaclav the interpreter. Subtle looks at Macarena tell of his unrequited love for her. His increasing fascination with Macarena moves him away from his noninterventionist stand to resignedly accept his fate by the end of the film along with Fontiveros who is Macarena's lover at the hands of the Nazi. Yet this is never overdone as the change of views underwent by the other characters towards the Nazi regime in particular the case of Julian Torralba. This little subplot of the film is quite moving rather sentimental and its quiet essence contrast sharply with the bombardment of dialogue coming from the rest of the cast.".

Besides the problems of any movie set  add to the tensions  a drama about Jews  as Nazis use Jewish and Gypsy prisoners Karel Dobry as extras to give an Andalucian look  the director Antonio Resines is sleeping with his main actress named Macarena Granada Penelope Cruz with no intention of leaving his spouse  and Macarena cooperates with this Nazi objective in hopes of freeing her daddy from one of Franco's prison . Soon some problems start to arise when Goebbels Johannes Silberscheneider himself plies her with favors the filmmaker and the rest of the crew Jorge Sanz  Neus Asensi  Rosa Maria Sarda  Loles Leon Santiago Segura  Jesus Bonilla encourage her to sleep with him for the good of the filming . This is an Award Winning picture by Fernando Trueba  the director of Belle Epoque .

La Nia De Tus Ojos results to be other of the innumerable stories to deal with deeds regarding Spanish Civil War  but including jealousies  antics and sexual escapades  being set in Nazi Deutschland  too . A familiar theme about the global horrors of a fratricide war  impossible to forget to our cinema . Based on true events during the filming of Carmen 1938 and Nights in Andalucia 1938 both starring Imperio Argentina . An agreeable story plenty of amusing moments  moving feelings and fun finale . It is a light  wistful comedy  easy to watch  and easier to love . It is as beautifully filmed as it is written and acted . This is one of those rare gems that does not stray from its purpose  to be a celebration of love and romance  and comic tale of a company who suffers several dangers and funny situations in another country during a hectic time  including the sad Kristallnachat 1938 being splendidly recreated . This is an tragicomedy that blends tragic elements  humor and irony . A seriousironic film about xenophobia  racism and Jews brutal persecution . Director Fernando Trueba  also writes the interesting script along with prestigious screenwriter Rafael Azcona  Luis Garcia Berlanga's usual and David Trueba  Fernando's brother . Filmed in his usual formal and luxurious style  without leaving a trace the joyful themes  in terms of fun and narrative excitement . Unforgettable Penelope Cruz who though plays a Folkloric player  Imperio Argentina lookalike  she parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching Penelope who gives one of the best screen acting . Very good secondary cast formed by Spanish familiar faces such as Rosa Maria Sarda  Neus Asensi  Santiago Segura  Jesus Bonilla  Maria Barranco  Juan Luis Galiardo as the Ambassador and many others . Evocative and jolly musical score by Antoine Duhamel  including various Folkloric songs marvelously sung by Penelope Cruz . In addition  a spotless pictorial cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe and a willingness  almost perfect of the elements of each shot  every sequence  every space  being filmed in Prague  Czech Republic . Aguirresarobe subsequently would make a prestigious career in Hollywood such as Fright night  The twilight saga eclipse The road  The others and many others . The picture is entertaining and well worth your time . The film is light and never somber no small accomplishment from Fernando Trueba and his team.This simple delightful motion picture was well directed by Fernando Trueba . His first success was pera Prima 1980 following the style of the Madrid comedy. He had major success with S Infiel y No mires Quin 1985 also known as  Be Wanton and Tread No Shame  starting a longer collaboration with the producer Andrs Vicente Gmez . He went on directing numerous successes such as Coarse salt  Too Much  Milagro de Candeal  Year of Enlightment  The Girl of Your Dreams  Calle 54  Embrujo De Shanghai  Chico and Rita and recently  The Artist and the Model . Trueba was President of the Spanish Academy of Motion Picture Arts and he received the 1994 Oscar for Best Foreign Film to Belle Epoque 1992 .".

The DVD I rented had two versions in Castillian Spanish and Mexican Spanish with English subtitles which was interesting when the characters spoke in German as that was not translated unless a translator actually did it in the film. Actually there was even a little Russian. The supporting cast gets a little slapstick at times but I found the film well worth it as a Cruz vehicleshe is quite a beautiful actress. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two years ago the European Union was voting on its Constitution. While in Madrid I asked a friend why Europe had finally decided to unify when Hitler wanted the very same thing and failed. He said You can't force people but you can pretend to give them a choice and they will go with the flow. That is what The Girl of My Dreams is about. Made in 1998 joining the soontobeformed EU was topical. Is this movie a warning by contrasting present with past? Was Spain once again going with the flow? Although the flow in 1940 Spain was Franco or death and unlike the fall of Nazism Franco's regime lasted 40 years. What most people don't realize about Franco's Spain is how inbed the dictator was with the Nazis despite his neutrality. Over 10000 Spaniards were sent to Nazi concentration camps. Survivors and their families are now attempting to repatriate hoping to receive social security. And now we learn from this movie that Spanish cinema became a small part of the Nazi propaganda machine. What other movie has given us this Spanish perspective? A troupe of Spanish actors head to Germany in a coproduction effort which has failure written all over it. The set and extras are subpar until Goebbels gets involved and falls for Macarena Penelope Cruz. Although Goebbels was a mastermind a monster and a womanizer I can believe he would fall for such a beautiful woman. He too was human.The naive troupe soon learns first hand the horrors of Nazism. Spain is known for its gypsies and its persecutions of its natives and the gypsies and Jews are the extras in the movie. The comparison is not lost on Macarena. Her sympathy for Vclav Passer the Russian Jew is a parallel of her father's plight. How could she not empathize? How could they not save each other? Any other ending would be tragic.Maybe Francoism isn't so bad after all they think. All of them desperately want to go home. Throughout the troupe acts like Spaniards. To the untrained eye the viewer may think they are being trite or ridiculous acting out a farce. I disagree. These are Spaniards being Spanish in a German world. There is a crucial scene where the troupe sits around a table and swears allegiance to Franco but in name only. Their body language says otherwise which you'll miss if you're reading subtitles.The subtitles don't do justice to the dialogue or the actors. The ensemble cast is a who's who of Spanish cinema. And Penelope is affecting an Andalucian accent that is a joy to listen to. This is a very funny film with dark overtones much like Life is Beautiful although not so tragic and yet the comedy works. Also there are nods to great films and period pieces. Don't be fooled dear reader in thinking Spanish cinema is so trite as to try and rip off Casablanca. How could anyone think that? It's called a nod. Not to mention how else do you escape Goebbels? The only way to watch this film if you are not fluent in Spanish is to watch it twice once for the dialogue once for the acting. Penelope has powerful scenes where her body language and tone should not be eclipsed by understanding her words. Goebbels doesn't speak Spanish but understands perfectly which shows what a monster he is. Don't let his limp fool you.Give the movie a chance and if you are disappointed it's not the movie's fault. You missed something crucial and historic. Go back and watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK I've never been a great fan of Penelope Cruz but I was going to take my Spanish exams two weeks before I watched this film and I thought it would be good practice. I was pleasantly surprised! The movie takes place in 1938 and shows the story of a Spanish film crew one that is funded by Franco which is invited by Goebels to Germany to make a Spanish and a German version of the film La Nina De Tus Ojos freely translated into something like The Girl Of Your Dreams. And when they arrive at the studios of UFA the mayhem begins! First of all I would like to note that this is a great production. It's obvious that plenty of money were thrown into it a thing that is obvious in some scenes. There are some scenes that are very funny and some characters in general make you laugh from the moment they appear on screen. Personally I will never forget that dog in the beginning! You will know when you'll see it.Trueba's directing is very good. Although I had heard his name before I hadn't had the chance to watch some other movie of his before this one. I will try to in the future. He managed to keep the whole thing running never making the viewer get bored at a single moment. And well at those moments when the plot had started getting a bit slow he threw in Penelope Cruz's breasts! What I didn't like was the political statements this movie tried to make. They seemed completely out of place and most of them were childish. First of all all those arguments about the Jews that Cruz's character made hardly had anything to do with what was going on at the moment and they seemed as if they were forced. In fact I can't understand why the Jewish character was there. He is the only one among the gypsies that were brought to the studio or at least they don't show us any more. But the Germans didn't place Jews and gypsies in the same concentration camps! Anyway... Some times it just felt as if the producers hoped that they could sell this film to Hollywood I hope you understand the connection. And of course the way they portrayed Goebels was way too cartoonish. Of course I know this is a comedy and Goebels had indeed some very ridiculous things going on about him and yes he did sleep with many actresses but well they show him way too silly most of the times...But if you set aside the moments where the story tries to make itself look really serious this is a good and very enjoyable film. In fact sometimes you will be surprised by the skill Trueba shows here. Spanish cinema has been giving us many gems in the last few years and I hope it will continue this way!".

	schema:reviewBody "A rather unusual Spanish film to say the least an Andalucan theatre group go to Nazi Germany to make a film and get swallowed up in all the nasty things going on there which in itself is rather cute given all the nasty things that had been going on back in Spain.The mixture of drama with a quizzical farcical touch of Spanish black humour thrown in does not quite work with me I'm afraid. Fernando Trueba as ever has done his job well. The scenesetting is truly exceptional the dialogues at times are really good but at others tend to jar on the ear making me wonder if this is the same Rafael Azcona Logroo 1926 as in other far better scripts and hearing Penlope Cruz with an Andalucan accent is definitely something not to be missed at any price.!!

	onyx:emotionText "A rather unusual Spanish film to say the least an Andalucan theatre group go to Nazi Germany to make a film and get swallowed up in all the nasty things going on there which in itself is rather cute given all the nasty things that had been going on back in Spain.The mixture of drama with a quizzical farcical touch of Spanish black humour thrown in does not quite work with me I'm afraid. Fernando Trueba as ever has done his job well. The scenesetting is truly exceptional the dialogues at times are really good but at others tend to jar on the ear making me wonder if this is the same Rafael Azcona Logroo 1926 as in other far better scripts and hearing Penlope Cruz with an Andalucan accent is definitely something not to be missed at any price.!!

Of course what else was Germany putting out back then?Naturally you can predict the rest of this story.  The group is ignorant to the Nazi atrocities and as they slowly discover what's happening they cannot help but be affected by it.  Yes it's the same old story told so many times before and in much better films.The story is sometimes comical or at least it attempts to be.  There is a series of cliche events that are simply not funny.  A homosexual actor makes advances at Spain's leading man.  The Nazi's are guntoting buffoons a la Hogan's Hero's.  And the women are bitchy to the point of being just plain silly.  There is little redeeming about this film.  I did like the set design for some of the scenes.  The colors were great.  But this stuff has all been done before.  Scenes are literally stolen from other 'great' films.  You will see Casablanca and To Be or Not to Be in several scenes. Penelope Cruz offered the most energy in this picture.  It is her character that first comes to terms with what is going on around her.  The problem is the character is not smart enough for me believe it.  Sorry Fernando ... but The Girl of Your Dreams is a forgettable nightmare.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Beck";
	schema:reviewBody "There's comedy there's drama and then there's rock music in a heady mix you may think it's a Masala film with all ingredients put into a melting pot and coming off deliciously entertaining. It's a story about the coming together of five individuals who share the common love for rock and for the fictional band Dying Breed before circumstances led them to form their own band to create their brand of music to move the world. It's the tale about the struggle of an indie band in the cutthroat world of the music industry where rules aren't always fair to begin with and often experiencing being muscled out from the bigger players who live to engineer sounds like hotshot producer Ran Shido Nakamura responsible for rival band Belle Ame versus those that play and create from the bottom of their hearts.From the tale of the individual character perspective it's about Koyuki Takeru Sato almost overutilizing his bug eyes when blindsided an oft bullied schoolboy who finds himself learning to play the guitar under the guidance of a master Takanori Takeyama before teaming up with fellow schoolmate Saku Aoi Nakamura where both find themselves propelled into the more adult world of performing under the auspices of a real band in real gigs rising from obscurity in school to having their own groupies and having fellow band members protect them from incessant bullies at school. For Ryusuke Hiro Mizushima it's about forging a name for himself coming from USA to Japan to do just that breaking away from his exband due to his attitude and animosity setting up some real competition. Chiba Kenta Kiritani the loud mouthed rapper who provides most of the comic relief as the impetuous frontman who knows a thing or two about rousing a crowd and Taira Osamu Mukai the bassist modelled after Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea completes the band BECK.Most of the subplots take us through the emotional roller coaster of the various characters especially that of Ryusuke Chiba and Koyuki as they deal with demons from the past envy and worry and romance respectively the latter having a relationship with Ryusuke's filmmaker sister Maho Shiori Kutsuna who is also being pursued by rival band Belle Ame frontman the actor turned singer Yoshito Yuta Furukawa. While all the cast members forming BECK share some incredible chemistry as a tight outfit these three characters and the cast playing them stand out especially with screen time dedicated to their struggles. I would have preferred a little more insights to possibly the most mature band member in Taira while Saku has a very fleeting romantic angle coming from an ardent BECK supporter Hiromi Sari Kurauchi.For its almost 2.5 hours runtime toward the ultimate goal and closure for the usual genre strategy of having to perform on the biggest stage possible we journey with the band toward the Grateful Sound Festival which is the fictional version of the real Fuji Rock Festival and the punchy pacing allowed for a lot of plot devices and elements getting squeezed effectively into the film such as the dark history of Ryusuke's guitar Lucille that comes with six bullet holes in its body jamming sessions with Blues legends and even guitar picks become objects used to emote through music. You'll also find yourself rooting for BECK throughout celebrating their inching toward success and crying when pressure builds and cracks starting to appear and threatening band longevity.But of course what is a film about a band if there's no rocking music to stomp your foot to? BECK provides this by the bucketloads although of course three signature tunes of the titular band stood out especially since we bear witness to their creation and practice sessions primed for that all important make or break performance. There's the rock tune Evolution with Chiba in his prime but making way quite surprisingly to Koyuki who is responsible for the slower English numbers and here's where some may be disappointed.We're made to believe that Koyuki while he can't understand nor converse in English can actually belt out English songs with plenty of heart even though he knows those lyrics by rote. And his innate ability is to move mountains and part oceans each time he opens his mouth to sing. Now this being a Japanese film and I suppose it's quite clear that the actor Takeru Sato may not be able to confidently emote and cause audiences to break down as per those on screen Yukihiko Tsutsumi came up with deliberately muting his voice. This may not go down well with some audiences but I thought it was a rather creative way to allow one's imagination to run wild into how Koyuki does actually sound like when singing and how awesome his voice would probably be judging from the supporters and fellow band members' reactions. It also played out almost like a running joke leaving you literally begging to hear some singing voice so I have absolutely no qualms about that.The last film involving Japanese rock music to form a premise was Fish Story also an excellent film that was one of my favourites in 2010. BECK belongs to the same charming vein that makes this a highly recommended film  and in my books one of the most entertaining film so far in 2011 for rock fans and nonfans alike. Clearly a favourite in my books and a contender as one of the best. Don't miss this!".

	schema:headline " Engaging Drama From Pat O'Connor";
	schema:reviewBody "The lives of two brothers living in a small town in Illinois are profoundly affected by an alleged incident which took place even before one of them was born in Inventing the Abbotts' directed by Pat O'Connor.  The Abbotts are one of the wealthiest most respected families in Haley Illinois Lloyd Abbott Will Patton is a successful businessman who along with his wife Joan Barbara Williams has raised three daughters the oldest of whom Alice Joanna Going is about to be married while the youngest Pamela Liv Tyler is about to graduate from high school.  The Holts on the other hand are from the other side of the tracks and Helen Holt Kathy Baker has had to raise her boys on her own.  John Billy Crudup the oldest was twoyearsold when his father was killed in an accident while Helen was pregnant with his brother Doug Joaquin Phoenix.  There's no mystery about what happened in the accident the bone of contention concerns what happened afterwards at least in the eyes of John even all these years later as he is about to enter collage.  John and Doug's father it seems had been business partners with Lloyd Abbott but after his death a patent that Mr. Holt owned somehow ended up in Lloyd Abbott's name making him a wealthy man while the Holt's ended up in their current state of affairs not exactly poor but barely making ends meet.  And since his youth John has been fixated with the Abbotts especially their daughters and one in particular Eleanor Jennifer Connelly.  But as with most things involving an obsession it only put John on a lifelong emotional road to nowhere.Told from Doug's point of view the story becomes a lesson in life when to leave the baggage of things best forgotten behind and move on.  Phoenix gives an affecting performance as Doug who has an onagainoffagain relationship with Pamela the one sister who is Just there' as she says according to her Alice is the good' one Eleanor the bad'.

	onyx:emotionText "The lives of two brothers living in a small town in Illinois are profoundly affected by an alleged incident which took place even before one of them was born in Inventing the Abbotts' directed by Pat O'Connor.  The Abbotts are one of the wealthiest most respected families in Haley Illinois Lloyd Abbott Will Patton is a successful businessman who along with his wife Joan Barbara Williams has raised three daughters the oldest of whom Alice Joanna Going is about to be married while the youngest Pamela Liv Tyler is about to graduate from high school.  The Holts on the other hand are from the other side of the tracks and Helen Holt Kathy Baker has had to raise her boys on her own.  John Billy Crudup the oldest was twoyearsold when his father was killed in an accident while Helen was pregnant with his brother Doug Joaquin Phoenix.  There's no mystery about what happened in the accident the bone of contention concerns what happened afterwards at least in the eyes of John even all these years later as he is about to enter collage.  John and Doug's father it seems had been business partners with Lloyd Abbott but after his death a patent that Mr. Holt owned somehow ended up in Lloyd Abbott's name making him a wealthy man while the Holt's ended up in their current state of affairs not exactly poor but barely making ends meet.  And since his youth John has been fixated with the Abbotts especially their daughters and one in particular Eleanor Jennifer Connelly.  But as with most things involving an obsession it only put John on a lifelong emotional road to nowhere.Told from Doug's point of view the story becomes a lesson in life when to leave the baggage of things best forgotten behind and move on.  Phoenix gives an affecting performance as Doug who has an onagainoffagain relationship with Pamela the one sister who is Just there' as she says according to her Alice is the good' one Eleanor the bad'.  He captures that sense of being at an age when uncertainty is the only absolute and you feel his need to search and seek out that toehold on life that is often elusive to the young.  There's an understated ring of truth in his portrayal that adds that depth which makes his character credible and one to whom it is easy to relate.Crudup delivers as well with a performance wound in introspective tension so tightly that there are moments when it seems almost tangible.

I recently viewed Inventing the Abbotts on a TV pay channel. I was so astounded by the emotional power of the film that I went to my Leonard Maltin guide curious to see what the reviewer there had to say about it. I was astounded to find that he had pretty much dismissed the whole thing as flaccid and disappointing. I could not help but disagree most emphatically. Maybe it is all a matter of taste but I loved the performances by all of the principal players. The cinematography and production design are terrific. I felt that the director had crafted a constantly engrossing moving film. The script which Maltin's reviewer called dull struck me as having a fine ear for strong dialogue all of which seemed very natural and effective to me. There is so much that is poignant and insightful and deeply touching in this entire piece that I would say that anyone who favors dramas with powerful romantic elements and thoughtful examination of the forces at work in society should make every effort to see this film. I do not know why it did not attract more notice when it first came out.".

Maybe it has got something to do with Joaquin Phoenix's presence in the movie in my humble opinion he is one tremendous actor and I love him and I saw this movie because he's in it. Or maybe just maybe Inventing the Abbotts is simply a sweet little romantic movie that I enjoyed very much. There is just something about the movie that touches me. I do agree that the best kind of love is the nomatterwhat kind and seeing it displayed so genuinely through Doug Phoenix and Pam Liv Tyler just did it for me. Not only was Joaquin brilliant as Doug his character is let's face it an allround good guy someone you'd feel comfortable with comfortable enough to let him meet the parents. And although there were some scenes where Liv Tyler didn't quite deliver the chemistry between the two of them is obvious and it helps to make their romance more possible than it already is.Billy Crudup plays the more interesting Holt brother Jacey and is thoroughly convincing in his role. Jennifer Connelly is beautiful and like most of the supporting cast is solid in her role. Special kudos must go to the actress who played Doug's mom her name eluded my memory. She handled her role with delicacy and care and turned what could be a fairly boring character to an interesting one. I love the exploration of family relationships and I was glad to see a solid relationship between Doug and his mother.All in all Inventing the Abbotts is a splendid movie that somehow teaches you to love no matter what.".

Now upon rewatching it for the first time since that fateful day ten years ago I see why. Because I was a pervert. Clearly I didn't enjoy this movie for its sweet message or its fine actors. Ugh.Let me gripe from the beginning.Alright so first we're introduced to actors that are far too old to be playing their characters. That's fine though  I grew up watching Saved by the Bell  I can deal with that. Then as we get to know the characters a little better we realize that well we really haven't gotten to know the characters at all. Other than Doug drawing breasts on a picture in school that's how we find out that he's a rebel and Pam saying that each sister is the good the bad or the one who gets away with everything we get nothing. There is literally NO character development. At times it seems like the director might have tried...then no by the end you just find yourself angry because you invested two and a half or whatever hours into a movie about people and you do not care in the slightest about any of the people.But what about their acting you say? Well that was just as terrible as the trite and obvious dialogue they were forced to spew. It's amazing when you see brilliant actors in earlier roles when they are give almost nothing to work with. Joaquin Phoenix is perhaps the most surprisingly horrid. Liv Tyler is cute  when isn't she  but she has nothing to work with and to be honest her acting was far from perfected has it ever been though? She plays this innocent rich girl to a tee but she still doesn't give us much of a reason to like her. And why does she like Phoenix's character Doug? Because of that rebellious drawing? Geesh. Give us some credit here.Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly were good I can't complain about their acting. But Jennifer Connelly disappears after the first twenty minutes in a ridiculous scene with a ridiculous reason.I could go on for hours. The secret behind the Abbotts and the death of the boys' father is pathetic. The attempt at sympathy for Lloyd Abbott falls flat. Maybe it wasn't intentional. Actually I hope it wasn't.Inventing the Abbotts keeps the viewer guessing what's going to happen from the getgo. It might be a Romeo and Juliet story it might be a romantic comingofage as the synopsis suggests. Unfortunately though it actually turns out to be such throwntogether nonsense that the viewer wishes that their idea had been what happened. Instead they're left with a characters they don't care about doing things they don't care about and offended sense of romanticism and a bad taste lingering in their mouths.".

The performances and the dialogue are not only believable but carry a certain weight that simply wracked my emotions.  It is a beautiful intimate story and many scenes are simply unforgettable.  The lines are not false or corny in any way.  And although it uses a few unoriginal plot devices it gets away with this by acknowledging that they are unoriginal i.e. the mother's death.

	schema:reviewBody "Inventing the Abbotts was one of those late night movies I had the opportunity to catch last night on HBO when I couldn't sleep due to nerve damage in my leg. Excellent cast and storyline. I had never even heard of it. It came out in 1997 and I amwas a movie goer. I don't even remember ever seeing previews on this one. I definitely would like to see it from the beginning although I don't think I missed too much. Joaquin Phoenix is an excellent actor even when he was nine years younger.

I came from a small town on the Gulf coast of Florida and this movie was something that I could really relate to as to how people in small towns are no matter where in the USA they are located just different names and faces.

Excellent cast and storyline. I had never even heard of it. It came out in 1997 and I amwas a movie goer. I don't even remember ever seeing previews on this one. I definitely would like to see it from the beginning although I don't think I missed too much. Joaquin Phoenix is an excellent actor even when he was nine years younger.

It has a Forest Gump kind of charm but a lot less humour. It also reminded me of the early soap operas like Peyton Place in the way it portrayed 1950's America. The unfolding of the family story is well spun out so that you only gradually come to appreciate the tensions involved and indeed some of the scenes are only understood after later revelations show up a new significance. The characters were believable and the twist in the tale of the story sufficiently unexpected but predictable in retrospect that you kick yourself for not realising. A family film with little to worry the censor other than some mild fisticuffs and a small amount of what might have been referred to in the film as fooling around. The interplay between the leading roles is exceptional both between the two brothers and between Liv Tyler and Joaquin Phoenix.".

It also works very well as a characterdriven film and there's plenty of symbolism in Ken Hixon's screenplay giving the film in combination with the score and beautiful cinematography a lyrical feel.'Inventing The Abbotts' boasts of a wonderful ensemble. The Abbott sisters are played by beauties Jennifer Connelly Joanna Going and Liv Tyler while the Holt brothers are played by Billy Crudup and Joaquin Phoenix. Tyler does a decent job while the rest of the actors are excellently cast. Phoenix portrays Doug's recklessness frivolity and growth with conviction while Crudup demonstrates Jacey's obsession and resentment with lan. Connelly as the wild and tragic sister Baker as the quiet strong and fragile mother Patton the ruthless father and Going the doomed sister are superb.O'Connor has successfully captured the look of the 50s and 60s. The art direction is splendid. There are some beautiful shots of breathtaking landscape.In the end 'Inventing The Abbotts' is a very human story. It stresses on human flaws the perception of them and how it can lead to ones destruction and how 'loving no matter what' can help overcome any obstacle.".

You watch the film and you wish you were there  the setting of 50s Midwest America is gorgeous and it provides an appropriate summer feel to the movie. The older members of the supporting cast also provide good solid performances  particularly Kathy Baker as the Holt boys' mother and Will Patton as the Abbott father. The main reason for watching the film is Joaquin Phoenix. He is gorgeous with those huge hungry green eyes and dark smouldering looks. Joaquin Phoenix and Billy Crudup  could you ask for better looking actors to appear as brothers? And then Jennifer Connelly Liv Tyler and Joanna Going as sisters?

Now early on in the movie the narrator an older Doug says that if the Abbotts had not existed Jacey would have had to invent them. Yet this is never illustrated only repeated randomly throughout the story which travels through unprovoked love anger and forgiveness.The acting is definitely marvelous especially considering that the characters are not well developed. People fall in and out of love pretend they're in love and cause serious problems because of love. But the audience does not follow in many key situations I felt betrayed by both the characters and the screenwriters. Why would a character do something no person alive would ever do nor would any person in his situation? If you're big on movies that revolve around aphorisms this is the one for you.

One can't help wondering why it took till 2000 with GLADIATOR that he became a well known actor Liv Tyler  I notice she has bags under her eyes but apart from that she's strikingly beautiful . Some people claim she's not much of an actress but I was too overcome by the view to notice Jennifer Connelly  Sexy just doesn't even begin to describe Ms Conelly Joanna Going  So many beautiful actresses so little time to watch movies You hear what I'm saying ? The cast of this movie are so hot the audience might just get incinerated but it's the story that's important to a movie  if the story isn't compelling then a film will fail as entertainment and the problem with INVENTING THE ABBOTS is that that the story is basically two lower class brothers trying to court two middle class sisters who have an authoritarian patriarch as a father in 1950s middle America . Despite some screen burning sex appeal the production values are very similar to a TVM  Strangely another movie ITV broadcast the same night THE HAUNTED HEART suffered from the same problem  which makes a slow paced story even less involving  though perhaps this movie was made for a female audience in mind".

However the film has absolutely no depth most of the characters were one dimensional. The only one that seemed to be real was the mother played by Kathy Baker. All the other characters seem to exist only as plot elements.The movie doesn't even seem to know the outside world existed. No music from that era How about some Buddy Holly? or even Perry Como? the only pop culture reference was when Mr. Abbott mentioned Jack Paar. Come on were they too cheap to pay rights to the music? As for the story well others have described it two families one rich one poor three sisters two brothers. One brother wants revenge on the other family by screwing the sisters the other brother truly loves one of the sisters. The Jacey character should have gotten his butt whup really hard he deserved it. Mr. Abbott's conversation with Doug should have been longer and it would have carried more weight if somebody more attractive played Mrs. Holt. Don't get me wrong Kathy Baker is a great actress and she gave the best performance in the movie which really isn't saying much but what Mr Holt said to Doug would be more understandable if she looked like Kim Basinger.My main problem with the movie is that it is SSSLLLOOOWWWW. A faster pacing certainly is needed by this movie it just seemed to drag on and on. Some of the conversations were so slow I lost interest in what they were talking about. Likewise with Far from Heaven a similar paean to the '50s melodrama the pacing is just too slow. The actual movies were faster paced and were easier to watch.Note to other film makers I know that there are filmmakers who actually appreciated those 50s Melodramas and would like to make tributes to them.

However I had never seen a judo movie before so I decided to give it a try.First of all the action scenes in the movie are great. I think people who are knowledgeable about ground fighting eg Brazilian jiujitsu or judo will appreciate the fight scenes. The fight scenes display both takedowns throws and trips when the fighters are standing up and ground fighting joint locks and chokes when the fights go to the ground. The transitions between the judo moves also flow very well. The actors in the movie even demonstrate proper techniques to break their falls when they get thrown to the ground.In addition to the fight scenes I love how the characters all have obstacles in their lives that they must overcome. I love how judo is used as a metaphor for the lives of these characters. When practicing judo a person will fall many times and find it hard to continue. To be successful the person must get up after falling down and continue to train. Similarly a person will experience hardships in life and often find it difficult to continue living. Despite these hardships one must put in his best effort and continue doing what he has to do.If you're expecting this movie to have actors flying in the air like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon you might be disappointed.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Throw Down";
	schema:reviewBody "Throw Down from 2004 is slightly different retaining the technical qualities his films are known to exhibit but having a storyline with themes that are more personal and in essence a shout out to anyone found struggling with whichever aspects of life at a point in time. There are no guns nor weapons galore nor are there cops and clear cut villains who are baying for blood. While it's about Judo don't come to expect a fightaminute film because this is not that movie with action sequences kept to a bare minimum though it does boast a scene which I thought was pandemonium done poetically with wonderful choreography that looked like a Judo free for all tournament is in progress set within the confines of a crammed pub premises that spilt over to the sidewalk and roads outside.Amongst the various Asian martial arts I never really come to understand the spirit of Judo and thus was my least favourite of them all until this film. Almost every martial art would have found a representative film to promote the art or the sport version and I haven't seen one that focused on Judo until Throw Down came along and the metaphor couldn't be more pronounced. In essence it may seem like a series of throws to get your opponent off balance and gaining an upper hand but it's truer of its spirit and intent. the message of dusting oneself off the ground when one gets defeated to get up on one's feet and try again. It is this spirit of perseverance and encouragement that is very much alive through the protagonists in the film a spirit that To explores in this movie.Written by Yau NaiHoi Au KinYee and Yip TinShing Throw Down follows the story of Sze To Louis Koo a one time Judo champion who decided to abruptly call it quits and now manages a karaoke pub and lounge spending his time wasted in drink and gambling void of the zest of life. Nobody knows the real reason behind this sudden change and it is we the audience who will journey with him down the trodden path of redemption. I think this film also marks Aaron Kwok's rare acting tutelage under Johnnie To as he plays the youngster Tony a Judo enthusiast who seeks out SzeTo for a genuine challenge and decided to stick around when he doesn't get the quality of challenge he's looking for. And Cherrie Ying rounds up the protagonist trio as Mona a cannotmakeit singer wannabe from Taiwan who tries hard to make it to the entertainment scene ending up at SzeTo's pub looking for a job.Each character is vastly different and encapsulates the different approaches toward this journey we call life. In SzeTo we see someone zapped of zeal and spirit giving up on what he does best and going through the motions nary wanting to lift a finger to help his one time master Cheng Lo Hoi Pang to continue his legacy and fight in an upcoming tournament much less helping anyone else. In Tony comes optimism forward looking and almost always seizing the moment be it the bouncer at the door or a formidable opponent he knows of just to spar for the sake of sparring to improve himself broken arm notwithstanding  where he even designs his own onearm wrestle. And in Mona's case one who simply never gives up even with the realization of a void of talent determined to want to breakthrough no matter what and seeking out her own opportunities to do so wherever it make take her home or abroad.Perhaps this film had remained Johnnie To's underrated best in terms of very focused characters each who will emerge quite differently by the time the final act rolls by given the active metaphor of Judo sparring throughout the narrative of being thrown down hard onto the ground yet finding strength from within to pick oneself up again. And To doesn't feel the need to be verbose about everything preferring to let the long takes with minimal dialogue allowing the music and the basic mood and feel of each scene to tell the story where even a key plot element has to be figured out that provides the answer why SzeTo acts the way he does and his reason for quitting while at his prime providing a sort of a mystery for the audience to unravel themselves.And the technical strengths of this film is very Milkyway gorgeously photographed by Cheung Siu Keung in both the interior shots and the outdoor ones that romanticizes the streets of Kowloon with plenty of light and shadow play being very pronounced in the film highlighting the state of mind each character find themselves in at any particular point in time. The Judo spars and fights are vividly designed to be real sans wirework and mats coupled with an engagingly punchy soundtrack that consistently accentuates the mood of the entire film. A superb support cast like one third of The Grasshoppers Calvin So as an outright homage by Johnnie To to Akira Kurosawa Eddie Cheung as a ruffian who talks to himself under his breath spewing insults and Tony Leung KarFai as a mean dojo owner with a menacing single Judo technique make this journey a classic one to undertake and definitely one of Johnnie To's best works in his filmography that deserves to be widely seen. Highly recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "Throw Down from 2004 is slightly different retaining the technical qualities his films are known to exhibit but having a storyline with themes that are more personal and in essence a shout out to anyone found struggling with whichever aspects of life at a point in time. There are no guns nor weapons galore nor are there cops and clear cut villains who are baying for blood. While it's about Judo don't come to expect a fightaminute film because this is not that movie with action sequences kept to a bare minimum though it does boast a scene which I thought was pandemonium done poetically with wonderful choreography that looked like a Judo free for all tournament is in progress set within the confines of a crammed pub premises that spilt over to the sidewalk and roads outside.Amongst the various Asian martial arts I never really come to understand the spirit of Judo and thus was my least favourite of them all until this film. Almost every martial art would have found a representative film to promote the art or the sport version and I haven't seen one that focused on Judo until Throw Down came along and the metaphor couldn't be more pronounced. In essence it may seem like a series of throws to get your opponent off balance and gaining an upper hand but it's truer of its spirit and intent. the message of dusting oneself off the ground when one gets defeated to get up on one's feet and try again. It is this spirit of perseverance and encouragement that is very much alive through the protagonists in the film a spirit that To explores in this movie.Written by Yau NaiHoi Au KinYee and Yip TinShing Throw Down follows the story of Sze To Louis Koo a one time Judo champion who decided to abruptly call it quits and now manages a karaoke pub and lounge spending his time wasted in drink and gambling void of the zest of life. Nobody knows the real reason behind this sudden change and it is we the audience who will journey with him down the trodden path of redemption. I think this film also marks Aaron Kwok's rare acting tutelage under Johnnie To as he plays the youngster Tony a Judo enthusiast who seeks out SzeTo for a genuine challenge and decided to stick around when he doesn't get the quality of challenge he's looking for. And Cherrie Ying rounds up the protagonist trio as Mona a cannotmakeit singer wannabe from Taiwan who tries hard to make it to the entertainment scene ending up at SzeTo's pub looking for a job.Each character is vastly different and encapsulates the different approaches toward this journey we call life. In SzeTo we see someone zapped of zeal and spirit giving up on what he does best and going through the motions nary wanting to lift a finger to help his one time master Cheng Lo Hoi Pang to continue his legacy and fight in an upcoming tournament much less helping anyone else. In Tony comes optimism forward looking and almost always seizing the moment be it the bouncer at the door or a formidable opponent he knows of just to spar for the sake of sparring to improve himself broken arm notwithstanding  where he even designs his own onearm wrestle. And in Mona's case one who simply never gives up even with the realization of a void of talent determined to want to breakthrough no matter what and seeking out her own opportunities to do so wherever it make take her home or abroad.Perhaps this film had remained Johnnie To's underrated best in terms of very focused characters each who will emerge quite differently by the time the final act rolls by given the active metaphor of Judo sparring throughout the narrative of being thrown down hard onto the ground yet finding strength from within to pick oneself up again. And To doesn't feel the need to be verbose about everything preferring to let the long takes with minimal dialogue allowing the music and the basic mood and feel of each scene to tell the story where even a key plot element has to be figured out that provides the answer why SzeTo acts the way he does and his reason for quitting while at his prime providing a sort of a mystery for the audience to unravel themselves.And the technical strengths of this film is very Milkyway gorgeously photographed by Cheung Siu Keung in both the interior shots and the outdoor ones that romanticizes the streets of Kowloon with plenty of light and shadow play being very pronounced in the film highlighting the state of mind each character find themselves in at any particular point in time.

It's more about the spirit of competition and getting back on your feet after you've been knocked down no pun intended.To me the film excels in its visuals. The film is shot beautifully with vivid colors that set the mood perfectly for each scene. And the finale? A duel in the windswept grass! How oldschool is that?!

This movie has deep characters all with different motives and ambitions. Although the martial arts sequences are not that long I think that they were filmed nicely Although it is a little dark to see sometimes. The parts where Tony is training with Szeto made me remember my training when I was younger and that really got to me. After finishing this movie I had a new sense of renewed vigor and excitement. I immediately went back to all my Judo training books and began practicing again. I haven't felt this good in years and I even arranged for a trip to Japan to observe Judo in it's homeland.I'm not saying that this movie will have the same effect on you but if you're a martial artist you just may appreciate what this movie has to offer. If you are not I think you can still see the message trying to be portrayed in the film  You can do anything you want in your life but it's all up to you".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been 7 years since I last watched this film and like red wine it gets better with age. Back then I didn't appreciate the full perspective displayed by the evergreen Johnnie To. Throw Down is a film that uses the show not tell principle to perfection. It does not use words or flashbacks to tell the audience what happened but rather uses raw emotions close facial expressions brutal desire to pursue a dream a warm brotherly embrace and the simple innate human nature of will power to continue on in life. It is a powerful film that makes the audience works hard and ultimate the result is a film that involves and emotes the senses of the audience.

	onyx:emotionText "It's been 7 years since I last watched this film and like red wine it gets better with age. Back then I didn't appreciate the full perspective displayed by the evergreen Johnnie To. Throw Down is a film that uses the show not tell principle to perfection. It does not use words or flashbacks to tell the audience what happened but rather uses raw emotions close facial expressions brutal desire to pursue a dream a warm brotherly embrace and the simple innate human nature of will power to continue on in life. It is a powerful film that makes the audience works hard and ultimate the result is a film that involves and emotes the senses of the audience.

And to make it even more unique is a very cheeky sense of silliness  only once or twice does Throwdown take itself seriously and contrary to just about every other Hong Kong movie I've ever seen the drama doesn't get confused or overblown to the point of embarrassing melodrama in the translation. At times it's very subtle again alien to most Hong Kong movies I've seen and poignant in addition to sometimes being very funny.And as for the acting I don't believe I'd seen Louis Koo act before but I think this was a fine introduction. The same goes for Cherrie Ying who nearly steals the show with her performance that's in tune with Faye Wong's in Chungking Express read so cute you just want to wear her as a hat. And Aaron Kwok I believe I'll have to reevaluate my apparently unfair opinion of him. He was excellent  both funny and intense and fully convincing as a brawler let's see an American pop singer get the same review.Anyway if you expect a somber action movie I can see where you might be disappointed. Personally I'm very pleased to know of a movie that's so relentlessly fun and charming.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have gone into this film very excited as I have become a Johnnie To fan only recently. After seeing both Election movies and PTU I have been totally amazed at the quality of director he is and how good his films can be. Throw Down continues my fanship of Mr To in style. I have always felt that wires and stunt doubles ruin films no matter what the genre and this is something Mr To seems to share with me. The fighting style of Judo is perfect for the physical aspect of the film. The actors can get close and throw each other to the ground without need of propelling themselves over bamboo trees which is great.The three main leads SzeTo Tony and Mona are pretty good. Though Mona seems to aimlessly wonder through the film and really only serve as a third wheel at times she is a nice enough support for the muscle of the film. Louise Koo is amazing as SzeTo the former champ turned club owner. His drunken and dazed followed by angered and determined emotions are all portrayed brilliantly. I was even surprised by Aaron Kwok who is great as the eager Judo fighter travelling from fight to fight and spurring SzeTo into his renewed sense of fight.The photography is spot on. The massive fight in the club is so perfectly filmed and cut with the Japanese vocal that it was a joy to watch. Even the simple scenes of clubs night life computer games room restaurant are all magnificently shot. And then as if the film were not good enough already the soundtrack sound editing production design such as the Ext Judo Championship scene and the screenplay are all as good as you could want. The first hour and ten minutes had me on the edge of my seat. The following twenty minutes had a more mysterious what can happen now feel but it is all just perfect.If you haven't seen a Johnny To film this might be a good starting point but be warned he makes no excuses and feels no obligation to explain anything about anything it's often left to the viewer to determine the why and the how. This for me is what filmmaking is all about.".

The DVD I purchased from Pacific Mall had no English Sub Titles but I didn't mind a whole lot. After all I did want to see this movie for the action initially. But unfortunately the action scenes where all under a minute in length and where filmed mostly at nighttime. The movie was the most disappointing film of the year for me and yes I have seen the socalled cinematic masterpieces Johnny To did earlier in his career. I was waiting for Johnny To to redeem himself with one of his upcoming films but sadly that never happened. Now that I think about it I shall change my rating and give Breaking News a 2.5. It's probably his best movie and that's not saying much. I despise this Director for his films never deliver what they promise. I think of him as US's Michael Bay and Joel. S. He is the poor man's John Woo Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam. The Action I list the fights. I don't go in to Detail. But I do mention the Length. So read at your own risk but I wouldn't consider it to be such extreme Spoilers. Hmm but I do sort of Spoil the end fight... So choose wisely.1st Hour Fight in the street between two main charactersIts about a minute in length and the second best fight in the filmTable Being Flipped OverI consider it to be an action scene Very ShortJudo Match ShortTraining Scene  Very Short2nd Hour Another Short FightA Very promising Fight Inside A Night Club ruined by the darkness and bad Camera Work. Thank you Johnny To for thinking of the audience.This Scene is made up of 3 fights. There are cuts in between them but I still consider them to be one. It starts of with a very short Training scene followed by a Darkish Fight then A Roof Top Fight. All very short. I mean like 10 seconds at most. And it ends with a Judo match that was the best fight in the movie. A great scene but not very longAnother Judo Match followed by a Short Training Scene  Overall very good but once again very very shortThe last fight is amusing. A blindfolded character faces a teacher in a cornfield. At night We as the audience don't see a thing. Maybe one or two attacks. Very disappointing fight. The best lit fights very probably the Judo scenes and the street fight. P.S Well what does this movie deserve I shall give it a 15. And I am still being generous I feel.".

The judo fighting was film pretty impressive and enjoyable. Cherrie Ying for some reason does not look hot in this movie but her appearance scene where she eating noodles and the owner keep throwing her stuff out the house was special.

Well Paul a man of science knows better and never takes the seer's advice.

She is a shy woman who has a car problem. She is in danger of losing her insurance as the traffic cop keeps writing her up for speeding. When Paul tells her about his discovery she decides to experiment with one of the monkeys in her lab. Little prepares her for the results. Diane takes matters into her own hands and suddenly she is a popular girl who even attracts Prince Geoffrey a hunk who falls for the new woman.Dale Launer a screen writer with a lot of hits directs this mildly funny comedy we never had seen before but which turns out to be a harmless way to spend an evening. Mr. Launer knows what he wants and he goes after it. He was lucky in casting the two talented principals in roles that with other actors might not have been as funny. Sandra Bullock appeared in this film before she made a splash in Speed and While You Were Sleeping. She plays the nerdy scientist with great panache. She goes a total transformation and we see her beauty that was hidden inside of what looked a homely girl. Tate Donovan also does good work as the nerdy Paul. Anne Bancroft is seen as the gypsy woman who can see the future. The rest of the cast do excellent work for Mr. Launer.Watch the film the next time it is shown on cable and let it work its magic on you.

I love Sandra Bullock and seeing her in this film made me smile because she is one of my favorite actresses and even though there wasn't anything to highly praise it was very cute and edgy and overall I liked the movie for what it was.

If anybody is looking for those usual Sandra Bullock movies this is not one of them. And the male actor is perfect. I think some people reviewing this just expected something similar to a romantic comedy they have seen in the years. Its not. It something different. The fact that there is a potion and the female uses it to seduce rich guys and the male uses it to break into a sorority house is pretty much on point. I think where people have a problem with the was the blonde who steals everything. She had a really long part in the movie and for most people that didn't fit in. But I see where they were going with this. They wanted somebody semi attractive in crappy clothes to look like a hooker who takes advantage of the male cause he was irresponsible with it. Meanwhile the woman wasn't irresponsible another male used it on her irresponsibly. But honestly for the movie it was a must see to me. Something you can watch on a Sunday and be fine. I kept watching it and wanted to keep watching it. So anything less than a 6 is by far too low to me. I will say I gave it a 7. The blonde hooker was a little too much for me. They could have used her in such better ways. Plus it was too clich of the 90's to use that type of looking hooker. But the plot was good and the acting was great. And it was funny. Especially the part where hes trying to convince his buddies to join in. Once again the blonde hooker comes and that should have been left out.".

This girl's single no way she's got a beautiful smile. I'm crushing pretty hard on Sandra right now. This movie's really good. O M holy G.....";

But this film is not as bad as some are portraying it being. It's okay for a gentle laugh.Of course the film is based on the old hit record of the same name...a song I always liked. Admittedly the film is not as good as the song. It actually has a decent premise but it sort of loses something in translation from song to script. It almost tries to be too cute for its own good. The sap she almost marries...well they don't develop that character at all which was a mistake. Perhaps the best part of the film is seeing Anne Bancroft as the gypsy! Somehow while watching the film I thought it would have been a decent premise for an episode of The Big Bang Theory...imagine Sheldon and Amy discovering such a potion...or Raj.Sandra Bullock who hadn't yet had a hit film  and this certainly was not one either  actually does fairly well here. Tate Donovan...well he soared to become one of the great superstars after this film...didn't he? Ahem. Although he does okay here too...but I kept thinking this is not leading man material. Perhaps better as the leading man's best friend.So if you've got a little time to waste sit down for a little laugh. Otherwise pass it by.".

The film isn't really funny at any point even if it has a sort of lackadaisical relaxed humour to it that makes it have the air of a comedy if not the laughs.  Looking at the plot and delivery I can see that it never wanted to be a spoof more an amiable action movie on a tvm budget.  The scenes are mostly watchable despite the fact that the low production values of the film show in almost every regard. The script is clichd and the action rather stilted and ATeamlike but it is still watchable.The main reason the film is just about watchable is that Belushi is quite amiable in the lead role.  His character is dumb and I think he knows it  however he doesn't take it too seriously and is enjoyable despite everything else.  Ferrer is good as the main villain doing essentially what he normally does in secondrate films.  Boyle has a minor insignificant role and doesn't make much difference.  Jefferson is quite cute but is just one big female sidekick' stereotype.Overall this is a pretty poor film that will annoy most of those who tune it to watch it.  It must be said that a film who's main selling point is James Belushi is in real trouble and that is the case here.  It's watchable if you are really looking for something that can be on in the background while you do chores in another room but as entertainment for 90 minutes? Forget about it!".

The lame plot has Belushi's topsecret unit being disbanded and several of its members turning renegade and plotting to steal nuclear weapons to sell to drug dealers and Belushi has to stop them for some reason this plan is revealed fairly early in the picture you know that Belushi is going to succeed at stopping them which pretty much kills whatever suspense there might have been. A good supporting cast Miguel Ferrer Peter Boyle and a few bursts of action towards the end of the picture don't really help it much. The script is flat the direction is workmanlike but nothing more the location shooting in Eastern Europe is depressing apparently the entire region looks like the industrial section of Jersey City and there's really little suspense style or anything else that might break the monotony.

There's a lot of propaganda here too and let's just not get into the number of coonskin hats. There's also plenty to offend modern sensibilities today as almost every North American stereotype of Mexicans is displayed as is Douglas Fairbanks...in blackface.That said this first feature film a fivereeler about the Alamo the very first Alamo film came out four years earlier but has been lost tells us a lot about how people less than 80 years after the event and less than 70 years after the end of the MexicanAmerican War remembered it. Bowie Travis and Crockett are there of course but the viewpoint character is actually Deaf Smith here called Silent Smith.I didn't recall hearing about Deaf Smith before but after looking him up on the Net realize just how important he was in that struggle. The chief reason for his importance  his marriage to a Latina and the contacts in both American and Mexican circles that enabled him to earn the nickname The Texas Spy  isn't in the film but at least they acknowledged his presence at the scene and the importance of his role then. The resemblance between his portrait and the actor who plays him Sam De Grasse who Fairbanks fans will remember fondly for his portrayal of Prince John in Robin Hood is also remarkable.The camera techniques are excellent too and must have been groundbreaking in 1915. There are two challenges here scenes where large numbers of actors including soldiers on horseback must move through small spaces the streets of San Antonio without overwhelming the audience as well as battle scenes where a wide open expanse of land and sky has to be filled up with an attacking Mexican Army. They solved the former by imaginative camera angles of the big picture interlaced with multiple quickly moving closeups of various important characters in the street during the crowd scenes. They did the best they could with the latter including a fisheye view with wide borders during some of the charges on the Alamo but they really could have used more actors out there to convey the overwhelming numerical superiority of the Mexican forces. Considering it was 1915 though what they did was very impressive.I like the way the end after Santa Anna's men have broken into the fort is filmed as a series of separate fights that fade into darkness. One should point out though that in the real battle Santa Anna did let all the women and children go.At the very end they also do something interesting with the flags that reminds me a little of the way a modern movie about the Civil War Gods And Generals opens.I saw the print that is available at the Internet Archive httpwww.archive.org. It's not of the best quality with some but not all of the title cards at the end of the original reels still in the picture and also with some breakup at the end. It also has a good sound track that's generally very epic and powerful but it isn't tied in to what is showing on the screen. Something more in sync with the film's scenes and with a few lighter human melodies and country refrains reminiscent of the era probably would enhance the experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "The historical accuracy of the films of D.W. Griffith is negligible to say the least! His films seem to portray history the way Griffith wished it were instead of how it really was. In Griffith's world the South was glorious and slavery an honorable institutionand this is pounded home in many of his films. The public ate these movies up and people thereby became ignorant of American history. His most famous film BIRTH OF A NATION is an amazing film to watch but as a history lesson it's pure junkas are many of his lesser films such as ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Here with MARTYRS OF THE ALAMO Griffith once again plays very fast and loose with facts. The main one you may notice when the film began is his retelling of the reasons for the Texas rebellion. While it's true that Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna was a horrible leader they didn't come much stupiderread up on the Pastry War and how the Mexicans lost Texas at San Jacinto to see what I mean one of the main reasons for the war was than many Texans wanted slaverywhile this was expressly forbidden by Mexican law. So at least some of the reason for this war was less than noble and Griffith not surprisingly ignores the evils of slaverysomething he did is a much grander fashion with BIRTH OF A NATION. As for the Mexicans in the film they are pretty indistinguishable from the Black people in BIRTH OF A NATION. In other words many of them are Americans of European stock who were painted up with dark dye to look Mexicany and some behaved like jerks and sexual perpetrators! The Black people in the film were also painted like this though they didn't really do much of anything other than sit back and watch or in an odd twist help the Texans! Now if you aren't looking at the film as fact and look at it from a film history point of view it is an incredible film. For 1915 it is one of the best costume dramas made in America up until this time and Griffith always had a knack for filming spectacular battle sequences. The costumes look much better than you'd see in contemporary films though I doubt if so many of the Americans wore coonskin caps. The Mexican troops were pretty appropriately dressed and the guns were not repeating rifles like I've actually seen in a couple films set in the 1830s they weren't invented yet or those few examples that existed were very very rare and were mostly only test models. The sets weren't bad though the Alamo in the film looked nothing like the actual building and there were a lot of trees and bushes where there shouldn't have been any.So overall the film looked great and was highly entertaining for 1915. While not as patently racist as BIRTH OF A NATION also 1915 the film is a mess historically as many of the details of the film were wrongthough this is true in some later films as well.By the way you may recognize the man who played Santa Ana. It's Walter Long who starred in several Laurel and Hardy films and he was a rather prolific actor during the 1930s.I actually found it one YouTubechopped into pieces and shown in low resolution. Despite these problems believe it or not the sound track was excellent and the opening prologue which was recently added was very goodthough I have no idea who the guy is who introduces the film. I also just checked and it's also available from NetFlix and if you are a member I suggest you try there first.".

	schema:headline " Birth to Texas";
	schema:reviewBody "The Birth of a Nation was the most influential film in this art form's history and its impact on subsequent pictures can be seen in those released shortly thereafter to those made many years later but few other films so markedly demonstrate that influence than this one Martyrs of the Alamo. This is seen from the opening subtitle The Birth of Texas as well as in its structure filming and editing of battle scenes its racist depiction of Mexicans and its glorification of white Americans and white women's virtue. Like the director of Martyrs of the Alamo Christy Cabanne most of the film's actors were Griffith veterans too. Fred Burns Sam De Grasse Allan Sears Tom Wilson and Walter Long all worked on The Birth of a Nation and Alfred Paget had also been a Griffith regular. Griffith himself probably didn't directly have much to do with this one concentrating mostly on his own films but it was one of the many Triangle pictures that he oversaw in a supervising capacity.Like The Birth of a Nation Martyrs of the Alamo is also historically inaccurate. Many of the inaccuracies seem to be made to imitate Griffith's narrative. Others such as the oddlooking Alamo and frequency of coonskin caps are less accounted for. One of the main impetuses for the Texas Revolution is ludicrously proposed to have been to protect the virtue of the American female settlers. One title card reads Under the dictator's rule the honor and life of American womanhood was held in contempt. This is augmented by scenes of loafing Mexican militiamen harassing female American settles and disrespecting the menmostly by not moving out of their way when they're passing by. Likewise in The Birth of a Nation when blacks took control they legislated interracial marriage which was a euphemism for black men raping white women with the KKK then depicted as the saviors of the white woman's virtue. On the issue of race there are also a few characters in blackface but they're mostly in the background of Martyrs of the Alamo not surprisingly the film makes no mention of Mexico's prohibition of slavery and the opposition to that by American immigrants to Texas.This film is also highly derivative of The Birth of a Nation and other Griffith films in its adoption and imitation of his grammar for filming battle scenes. It's that the imitation isn't bad that makes this picture entertaining. The editing is nicely fast paced although occasionally choppy. There's extensive focus on individual skirmishes and crosscutting between those scenes. Varied camera positions are employed including iris long shots. These sequences aren't nearly as good as those in Griffith's mature work which were aided by cinematographer G.W. Bitzer and editors James and Rose Smith but they're better than some other later derivative battle scenes in addition to preGriffith filmed battles. Nevertheless Cabanne and his crew really don't do anything innovative it's copied from Griffith and his coworkers. One slight exception in differing style might be the extensive use of fades in Martyrs of the Alamo but they're uneven in length and purpose and often contribute to the sense of choppy editing.Some of the acting and characters in this film are rather amusing for 1915.

	onyx:emotionText "The Birth of a Nation was the most influential film in this art form's history and its impact on subsequent pictures can be seen in those released shortly thereafter to those made many years later but few other films so markedly demonstrate that influence than this one Martyrs of the Alamo. This is seen from the opening subtitle The Birth of Texas as well as in its structure filming and editing of battle scenes its racist depiction of Mexicans and its glorification of white Americans and white women's virtue. Like the director of Martyrs of the Alamo Christy Cabanne most of the film's actors were Griffith veterans too. Fred Burns Sam De Grasse Allan Sears Tom Wilson and Walter Long all worked on The Birth of a Nation and Alfred Paget had also been a Griffith regular. Griffith himself probably didn't directly have much to do with this one concentrating mostly on his own films but it was one of the many Triangle pictures that he oversaw in a supervising capacity.Like The Birth of a Nation Martyrs of the Alamo is also historically inaccurate. Many of the inaccuracies seem to be made to imitate Griffith's narrative. Others such as the oddlooking Alamo and frequency of coonskin caps are less accounted for. One of the main impetuses for the Texas Revolution is ludicrously proposed to have been to protect the virtue of the American female settlers. One title card reads Under the dictator's rule the honor and life of American womanhood was held in contempt. This is augmented by scenes of loafing Mexican militiamen harassing female American settles and disrespecting the menmostly by not moving out of their way when they're passing by. Likewise in The Birth of a Nation when blacks took control they legislated interracial marriage which was a euphemism for black men raping white women with the KKK then depicted as the saviors of the white woman's virtue. On the issue of race there are also a few characters in blackface but they're mostly in the background of Martyrs of the Alamo not surprisingly the film makes no mention of Mexico's prohibition of slavery and the opposition to that by American immigrants to Texas.This film is also highly derivative of The Birth of a Nation and other Griffith films in its adoption and imitation of his grammar for filming battle scenes. It's that the imitation isn't bad that makes this picture entertaining. The editing is nicely fast paced although occasionally choppy. There's extensive focus on individual skirmishes and crosscutting between those scenes. Varied camera positions are employed including iris long shots. These sequences aren't nearly as good as those in Griffith's mature work which were aided by cinematographer G.W. Bitzer and editors James and Rose Smith but they're better than some other later derivative battle scenes in addition to preGriffith filmed battles. Nevertheless Cabanne and his crew really don't do anything innovative it's copied from Griffith and his coworkers. One slight exception in differing style might be the extensive use of fades in Martyrs of the Alamo but they're uneven in length and purpose and often contribute to the sense of choppy editing.Some of the acting and characters in this film are rather amusing for 1915. James Bowie and Davy Crockett are played like a buddy duo from their introduction and Paget he also played Prince Belshazzar in Intolerance and Sears also good in Sold for Marriage as two of the better character actors of their day never overdramatized their parts. Long however hammed his part the most which I think helps to deflect some of the inaccuracies and bigotry of the film. In addition to having played the Mexican leader Santa Anna here Long played Gus in The Birth of a Nation the black villain who tried to rape Mae Marsh's childlike character.

	schema:reviewBody "As we know The Birth of a Nation 1915 directed by D.W. Griffith justifies the institution of slavery and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction as the need to protect white women from Negro lust. Later that year Griffith also produced Martyrs of the Alamo which reveals that the war in which Texas declared and won its independence from Mexico was brought about by Mexican lust for white women. So many white women were being accosted by the Mexican soldiers it seems that the white men finally had to take up arms to protect them. When Santa Anna and his troops come in to put down the rebellion the Texians took refuge in the Alamo and we all know what happened next.As an example of how cruel and ruthless the Mexican soldiers are we see a scene in which a little boy is bayonetted his body picked up and flung out of the way. And when the battle is over Santa Anna has anyone that survived the massacre executed except for goodlooking white women of course. We see an old woman being taken away for execution while a young pretty blonde is spared. The intertitle notes that Santa Anna is an inveterate drug fiend known for his shameless orgies. Right after that we see him grabbing the pretty blonde but she slaps him and gets away from him. By the way Santa Anna is played by Walter Long the same man that played Gus in The Birth of a Nation the black man that tried to rape Flora.We have all heard how the Mexican soldiers were caught off guard when Sam Houston attacked at San Jacinto because they were taking their siesta. But in addition to that according to this movie Santa Anna appearing somewhat stoned is busy having women dance for him while a Mexican guard watches the show himself instead of watching for such things as an advancing army of Texians. So Mexican lust not only was the cause of the Texas revolution it was also the cause of Mexico's defeat as well.".

At the time of the liberation of Paris in World War 2 women who had been suspected of horizontal collaboration i.e. fornicating with the Nazis had their heads shaved in public  we see that in this film too. The film is overlong for my tastes and there is a rather soporific Opera spectacle which wasted a good few minutes. Nevertheless it has the merit of having been made and seen by the French public. I happened to be in France in 1974 when the film came out and remember all sorts of protests about it by the Chinese population in France !! It would't be possible to bring out such a film now as it would be attacked as being racist or some other similar rubbish.

	schema:reviewBody "Two Women was screened before 1500 moviegoers in a sold out house at the 4th Annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival in April 2002 at the Virginia Theatre in Champaign Illinois.WriterDirector Tahmineh Milani flew from Iran to be Roger Ebert's guest at the film festival showing of her most outstanding movie.Following the showing T. Milani received a standing ovation as Roger Ebert escorted her on stage where she answered questions about her life and the making of this true life Iranian story.She explained about the customs of the Iranian people pertaining to the freedom of Iranian women in that country. This movie was a true story of one of T. Milani's friend's life.  Ms. Milani stated that currently about 50 percent of her country's male population believes that way.There were two wonderful female stars in the film. Niki Karimi played Fereshteh and Marila Zare'i played the role of her friend Roya. These two female Iranian actors showed superb acting ability and dedication to their acting craft.  This movie was by far so different than other formula movies cranked out by the movie industry.  While other movies may be hard to remember years later this film will remain on the moviegoer's mind for time to come.  It was that powerful and intense.The movie was spoken in Farsi speech with English subtitles but that did not diminish from the understanding of the film. One gets absorbed into the film and easily follows the story line.A crazed maniac character Hassan played by Mohammad Reza Forutan was menacing scary and believable. You would not want Hassan stalking you as he stalked Fereshteh. He is a fine and scary actor!Atila Pesiani played Ahmad Fereshteh's arranged marriage husband. Ahmad is traditional and jealous of Fereshteh trying to have a personal life of enrichment. Although a good man in his heart he follows the old Iranian customs whereby a women cannot do anything in public by herself and must have a male family member with her wherever she goes.Reza Khandan played Fereshteh's traditional father who arranges his daughter's marriage to an older man. Fereshteh's father displays a false pride and shame of everything that his daughter does.The enlightenment comes to the audience when we learn that traditional Iranian men seem to be ashamed and feel dishonor no matter what their female children do. Always worrying what the neighbors will think Fereshteh's father keeps her in a virtual prison of the home until he marries her off to Ahmad who in turn also keeps Fereshteh homebound until her sanity becomes jeopardized in the end.This is a great film. And Director Milani is to be praised in spite of the political and judicial liability hanging over her for making this film. Tahmineh Milani has given the world a frank and realistic look into the way women are treated in Iran.This magnificent foreign film is an undeniable 10!  It is available on VCR and DVD.  Check it out truly!".

Ms. Milani stated that currently about 50 percent of her country's male population believes that way.There were two wonderful female stars in the film. Niki Karimi played Fereshteh and Marila Zare'i played the role of her friend Roya. These two female Iranian actors showed superb acting ability and dedication to their acting craft.  This movie was by far so different than other formula movies cranked out by the movie industry.  While other movies may be hard to remember years later this film will remain on the moviegoer's mind for time to come.  It was that powerful and intense.The movie was spoken in Farsi speech with English subtitles but that did not diminish from the understanding of the film. One gets absorbed into the film and easily follows the story line.A crazed maniac character Hassan played by Mohammad Reza Forutan was menacing scary and believable. You would not want Hassan stalking you as he stalked Fereshteh. He is a fine and scary actor!Atila Pesiani played Ahmad Fereshteh's arranged marriage husband. Ahmad is traditional and jealous of Fereshteh trying to have a personal life of enrichment. Although a good man in his heart he follows the old Iranian customs whereby a women cannot do anything in public by herself and must have a male family member with her wherever she goes.Reza Khandan played Fereshteh's traditional father who arranges his daughter's marriage to an older man. Fereshteh's father displays a false pride and shame of everything that his daughter does.The enlightenment comes to the audience when we learn that traditional Iranian men seem to be ashamed and feel dishonor no matter what their female children do. Always worrying what the neighbors will think Fereshteh's father keeps her in a virtual prison of the home until he marries her off to Ahmad who in turn also keeps Fereshteh homebound until her sanity becomes jeopardized in the end.This is a great film. And Director Milani is to be praised in spite of the political and judicial liability hanging over her for making this film. Tahmineh Milani has given the world a frank and realistic look into the way women are treated in Iran.This magnificent foreign film is an undeniable 10!  It is available on VCR and DVD.  Check it out truly!";

If you regard movies as psychocultural mirrors of their places of origin then it becomes evident that the spark of positivism is due to the more liberated Iran and consequently the anguish portrayed in this film is also a reflection of the Iranian women's agony.But in this black night of tragedy brilliant stars of hope appear and glimmer for a while but not long though. The movie even begins with an ominous phone call by a desperate woman. It then unfolds flashbacks sandwiched between the main story. This way the movie never lets go of the suspense while on the same time it unravels new things for the viewer.It seems quite strange for me that such a movie could pass the beardstrokingshariainhand ayatollahs considering the fact that it is very feministic and portrays women as careerists and independent. Maybe this is another sign of the more open Iran mentioned above. There are however implications from the men in the movie that the women should stay home and do the traditional chores around the house i.e. giving birth and cooking food.All of the actors in this movie are very good particularly Niki Karimi who should get an Oscar or at least a Palme D'or for her breathtaking perfomance on the stairs reflecting her life and my favourite Mohammed Reza Foroutan who plays the somewhat shy and misunderstood maniac very well compare this roll with the one in Zire Pooste Shahr and you'll see what a great actor he is.".

	schema:reviewBody "DHAAI AKSHAR PREM KE is a hopelessly contrived and overly melodramatic musical romance from Bollywood yet it deserves attention because of its central performance by the reigning queen of Bollywood Aishwarya Rai. The beautiful Rai is seen to much better effect in such exemplary romantic spectaculars as HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM TAAL and DEVDAS but she is quite compelling here playing a girl hopelessly in love with a man pining for someone else and ultimately forced as she is in so many films to marry a man she doesn't love.A perennial staple of the melodramatic form is the misunderstanding that escalates to a point where it becomes too late to tell the truth and straighten things out. Here a young college girl from a traditional family Sahiba Rai is rescued first from attackers and then from a suicide attempt by Karan Abhishek Bachchan a young army captain on leave. He takes her home to her family's rural estate and is assumed to be her new husband and welcomed enthusiastically by all the relatives but the girl's angry father Yogi Amrish Puri who had opposed her going away. With each heartwarming ritual and ceremony Karan becomes more and more a part of the family even though he is in love with a girl back home and eager to get back to her. Gradually Sahiba grows to love him and eventually tells him so and begs him not to go.To make a long story 167 minutes short Karan runs out on Sahiba only to learn that things at home are not what he thought they were. He returns to Sahiba's home to reclaim her only to find her about to be married to the son of one of Yogi's business partners. Things take a particularly egregious melodramatic turn when two characters resort to some oldfashioned villainy all that's missing are twirling mustaches including tying up two of the protagonists to posts in a factory which is then set on fire. Having proved himself a man of action battling terrorists in the film's opening sequence Karan gets an opportunity to be a twofisted pistolshooting hero again in the film's implausible finale.With the exception of a magnificent ceremonial number performed by Rai and a number of ornately dressed backup dancers at the film's midway point the songs are rather simply staged and consist largely of fantasy duets performed by Rai and Bachchan against exotic Indian backdrops and such farflung locations as Scotland and Switzerland. The abrupt changes in setting and costume are rather jarring and tend to break the mood of the film and slow down the narrative.The film remains worth seeing for Rai's moving portrayal of an anguished village girl who is both eager to break out of her traditional family structure yet is clearly nourished and empowered by the strong support she gets from her mother grandmother aunts and uncles. Rai's expressive eyes and mouth convey in heartbreaking fashion the gradual buildup of love for the man who rescued her and her anxiety at the prospect of him leaving. Even amidst the outlandish turn of events on display here Rai proves what a superb film actress she is expressing a full spectrum of emotions from joy and contentment to fear and suicidal despair never once striking a false note.".

The problem is that hero changed his heart for another girl too 'naturally' after his unspoken love failed. True someone's loss is someone's gain. Yet what a condescending gain for the poor girl who didn't get his love in the first place. Most of the dancing scenes are imaginary and quite senseless.Aishwarya Rai was good at playing such poignant role for sure but she needs more colorful characters to enrich her performance experience.".

Special mention must go to the fact that this is so far the only movie and there never will be another in which you get to see Abhishek Bachchan Aishwariya Rai AND Salman Khan together. Yes you read it right. The title song of the movie which has approx 4 versions is quite nice on the ears. Anupam Amrish Shakti and all the other supporting actors are quite good. Abhishek made this movie in his flop period before he was successful but you can see that he is a chip if the old Godly block".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow...I sure was shocked by the incredibly low score of 3.8 for this film! While the film is far from perfect it IS still very good and well worth seeing and I cannot understand the hatred viewers have for this film.Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke is a very unusual film. It's very much like taking a traditional Indian love story complete with song and dance numbers and combining it with While You Were Sleeping as well as RamboI kid you not! It begins with Karan Abhishek Bachchanon some sort of mission for the Indian army. His exploits in this opening scene would make John Wayne look like a sissy!! He is THAT macho as he kills dozens of AK47armed killers with just his semiautomatic pistols. Heck he even catches the Indian flag in the process! He is in many ways like an Indian Rambo! He then is given leave from the military and this Captain heads back to a girl he loves. However on the way he is pulled into the life of a damsel in distress Aishwarya Raiwho later became Aishwarya Rai Bachchan when she married Abhishek in 2007. She witnessed a murder and is about to be killed to keep his secret but supermacho Karan comes to the rescue. Now you'd THINK that that would be it but soon Karan comes to her rescue again. It seems that Sahiba is depressed and doesn't care if she lives or dies. Why? Because her family has disowned her for refusing to marry the man they picked for her. So being an allaround swell guy Karan agrees to accompany her home and pretend to be her boyfriend. The problem is that the family assumes he is her new husband!! And like in While You Were Sleeping the little lie steamrolls into a huge and occasionally funny predicament. So what's next? Well much of it is very predictable and formulaicyou KNOW by the end of the film that Karan and Sahiba must fall in love. But how they get there is kind of crazyand once again very Rambolike! So is this odd film worth seeing? Absolutely. While the story IS very predictable in some ways it also kept me guessing and was quite enjoyable as well. Why the strong dislike for it? I don't really know. Perhaps these folks who scored it low are a lot more familiar with Indian films than meI've only seen about a hundred as the films are still not that readily available here in the States but it IS getting easier each year. Regardless I liked it.By the way if you do see this one don't be surprised if in some of the song and dance numbers that the folks suddenly appear in other countries such as Switzerland and Scotland. I've seen this several times before such as in Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's I Have Found It and it's apparently not all that uncommon for Bollywood pictures. Weird huh?!".

It's pretty much unpleasant from beginning to end from prostitution to fratricide and not in the least lifeaffirming. Everyone from the psychopathic realtor played by Slater to the morally vacuous and weakwilled groomtobe is grotesque. However I venture to add it IS funny and it IS clever.Not merely as Americans like to say 'gross out' funny but morally satirical. One of the darkest moments of the film is where the practising Jew character the most morally developed of all in the movie has an attack of conscience as the group are preparing to dispose of the bodies of a prostitute and a security guard out in the desert.He says they must observe the Jewish practice that requires the bodies to be interred as complete which provies impossible as both have been hacked up wrapped up in plastic and distributed amongst four suitcases. What follows is a gruesome jigsaw puzzle of body parts culminating a great sight gag of them lying out neatly arranged.There is a more serious premise behind the story of how five apparently ordinary guys who start out on a bachelor weekend are drawn progressively into more and more despicable acts. One of the great moral questions from the time of the Greek moral philosophers to our own experience of the holocaust is how men come to do evil.Are there just some evil men waiting for their potential to be awakened or is there the potential in all of us if we are given the excuse and the opportunity? Or is all that is required for evil as the axiom states that good men do nothing? Certainly in the early part of the movie when the first death is down to an accident resulting from a series of misdemeanours the more moral and sympathetic members of the groups are crucially transfixed by the possible damage to themselves from coming clean at that point.It's at that point that Slater's character the charming functioning psychopath he does them so well is able to seize the initiative provide what appears to be a practical and just about morally palatable solution to their problem and a path back to normality.This is the true moral junction of the film everything beyond that is a satirical commentary on their inability to do the one good thing required of them  come clean at the outset. Trying to read the film as totally naturalistic beyond that point doesn't work  it becomes increasingly absurd and unpredictable for comic purposes.This is a very wordy movie. The script is subtle and complex and a large part of that is given over to Slater and his persuasive speeches on why a particular course of action should be taken at a particular time.In the beginning he exhorts the group that they should cover up the prostitute's death and provides practical arguments to support this seizing on the upcoming wedding as a moral defence for the actions they are going to commit. The movie's absurdity lies in the ever more extreme and disproportionate acts the group are prepared to commit simply for a wedding to take place.But there is a serious point underlying this. One common facet of 'organised evil' by apparently normal moral individuals is the belief that unpleasant acts are necessary for a greater good. This becomes a device to obscure the badness of the bad things because the intent remains good. Should we judge acts by themselves or their intent?The film suggests in contemporary society we've descended even lower. We are obsessed by the appearance of morality rather than the actual practice of it. A society obsessed by symbols ceremony and rituals rather than the truths they are supposed to represent. And Cameron Diaz is a wonderful exemplar of that ideal as the ruthless bride who steals the last 10 minutes of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am positive that at least 50 of the people seeing Very Bad Things for the first time are going to hate it outright. They are going to be offended by the sensationalistic violence by the sociopathic behavior of the principals and by the portrayal of women as harpies and of men as buffoons and clowns. They will hate the way the movie portrays marriage and family and children. They will hate the vulgar language and the drunken maundering and the utter charmlessness of almost every character in the film. And they will especially hate the excruciating progression of the plot. In the tradition of Hitchcockian films like Shallow Grave A Simple Plan and Dead In the Water the events in the plot start out with a of a bad mistake compounded by the worst aspects of human nature... and then motives of greed and fear cause more mistakes things start to spiral out of control and finally one mistake piles onto another until things are so awful that suicide seems like an easy way out...and in fact an amazingly large number of people end up dead. That can be hard to watch and it isn't every body's cup of tea. I fall into the other 50 the group who enjoy this kind of savage meanspirited humor. I am of the opinion that Berg made exactly the film he wanted to make and that he left it up to the audience to take it or leave it. I think that Berg wanted to hit a top note of wicked glee right away and to sustain it for as long as he possibly could. And I think that the actors  Favreau Slater and Stern especially  came through with hysteric overblown performances that make the movie exhausting and hard to watch in spots. But there is JUST enough believability to their performances that you feel as if that could be you stuck in their place. Special kudos also go to Cameron Diaz for being willing to play such a narcissistic twit somewhat of a stretch from the sunny happy All American Girl types she has done so well over the last few years And to Jeanne Tripplehorn as the baffled and angry wife of one of the brothers who knows something is wrong and can't be deflected until she learns the truth.The final shot as Diaz's character runs screaming out the dream hometurnednightmare to collapse gibbering in the street is priceless and serves as kind of a cosmic punchline to all the mayhem murder and malice of the presetting 90 minutes and leaves me with a guilty grin on my face and a huge sense of relief  my life looks so good compared to what just went on in the movie that I want to dance like a white guy! The proper reaction to Very Bad Things probably ranges somewhere between a horrified giggles and the drunken bray of startled laughter you would make after hearing a really good dead baby joke for the first time.".

But it was given the circumstances the smart play. Robert BoydIf anything Peter Berg's Very Bad Things triggers a response regardless of the nature. My initial reaction to the dark disturbing parody was bleak and unpleasant. The movie displays sick demented behavior and despicable annoying characters. It's not humanly possible to like anyone in the movie. Christian Slater's character is cruel and selfish. Cameron Diaz displays a whiny obsessive portrayal. I needed an aspirin during this unfunny mess.I viewed the film a second time surprisingly my opinion differed greatly. I liked all the same parts but this time my attitude changed. I watched with more of an open mindthe film is advertised as a dark comedy butalthough a few explosively funny moments occurthe film seldom provokes laughs. It's important to watch abstractly with no remorse or guilt for enjoying the unholy revelation of events. Everything that happens here makes perfect sense under the circumstances. If you don't expect a light hearted laugh a minute comedy then Very Bad Things fulfills a longneeded niche in Hollywood.Very Bad Things is like the tagline notes a very savage comedy. It does not paint a happy portrait of our societyit's a scathing satire on American values. It's needlessly racist sexist and vulgar. It depicts a gross portrayal of modern families the delicate but perverse male mindset disgusting bachelor parties and even the happiest day of many livesthe wedding day.Cameron Diaz plays Laura Garrety a selfish whiny bridetobe. She's getting married in three days to a handsome fellow named Kyle Fisher Jon Faveau from Swingers. She isn't happy with his decision to travel to Vegas with his friends for a bachelor party. They include two bickering brothers Adam Daniel Stern and Michael Jeremy Piven who stepped into the role after Adam Sandler stepped out to make The Waterboy. as well as an organized but cruel real estate agent named Robert Boyd Christian Slater and a quiet mechanic named Charles Moore Leland Orser.Once they arrive in Vegas a stylistic montage sequence shows the five friends gambling snorting cocaine and drinking lots of alcohol. They settle in for the night at a fancy hotel where a stripper Carla Scott arrives and lap dances the guys into a frenzy. Michael takes her into the bathroom for sex but accidentally drives the stripper's head into a towel hook instantly killing her. The rest of the men panic and want to call for help but Boyd has a better idea. He wants to bury the body in the nearby desert. The intrusion of a hotel security guard complicates the issue. Boyd kills him with a corkscrew during a particularly unpleasant scene. The rest decide to use a chain saw to cut up the bodies and carry them to the desert in suitcases where they do indeed put the unfortunate souls underground.Although not for the easily offended Very Bad Things takes us on a roller coaster ride through immorality and its consequences. It's fun watching the sequences of events the bodies piling up and the exaggeration of our most improper impulses.  A great cast demonstrates their fine acting abilities. The script also by Peter Berg features very smart witty dialogue. Berg directs the chaos with an engaging styleespecially during the scenes in Vegas and keeps the momentum throughout the movie. If the filmmakers played the material as straight drama it might have worked even better but as it is Very Bad Things is a joy ride through harsh satire.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're expecting a pleasant Howard Hawksian comedy you rented the wrong damn movie!  So don't say I didn't warn you.  Besides the videoDVD cover shows Christian Slater holding a chainsaw.  How much warning do you need? First of all Very Bad Things works out better if you don't treat it as a straightforward comedy.  It's basically a mix of suspense and comedy. Almost like Fargo.  Now before you jump on me VBT is nowhere near as great as Fargo but the two films are practically equal in tone. At least the film contains one element that some comedies lack  the characters AREN'T acting as if they're in a comedy!  When the characters panic and do foolish things they're not contrived comic moments.  People do the most absurd things when they panic.  It's hard to explain what exactly it is that makes the film funny.  You just have to watch the film.  But people really really mean it when they label this as a dark comedy.  Writerdirector Peter Berg tries to keep a somewhat quirky tone though.  There are some slanty camera angles and the soundtrack conflicts with the tone of each scene.  Don't worry it's done intentionally.  Berg who's known mostly as an actor in films like Cop Land and The Great White Hype makes a fine directorial debut though there is some improper pacing.  Finally the actors are what make this film most worth seeing.  I've always been a fan of Christian Slater and believe him to be an underrated talent. He seems passionate about every character he plays and spouts out every line of dialogue like it's poetry.  His character is very interesting as he seems to keep his cool in every situation no matter how tragic or violent. Daniel Stern's another underrated talent since he mostly does lightweight family comedies like the Home Alone flicks and does a great job at playing his constantly paranoid character who's the complete opposite of Slater's.  Cameron Diaz gives a fine comic performance as the tightlywound hottempered wife of Jon Favreau.  I think this is one of her most unique performances uptodate.  I think this was before she became such a sex symbol.  Now fame has gone a little bit more to her head starring in such throwaway flicks as the Charlie's Angels films and The Sweetest Thing. She is in fact a very talented actress but this movie most proves that she's more than just a pretty face.  Speaking of pretty faces Jeanne Tripplehorn also gives a fine comic performance as Stern's tightlywound wife.  I consider myself an admirer of dark comedies but any type of film can fail.  This one doesn't.  It made me laugh and kept me in suspense.  And it has a great share of profanity violence and nudity that Asian stripper was deliciously hot!!!.  Very Bad Things is not for the straitlaced or faint of heart but for the rest of ushave fun!!!My score  7 out of 10".

Meanwhile Laura organizes the wedding party and during the rehearsal Michael and Adam have a serious argument and Michael decides to hit the minivan of his brother. Adam tries to protect his minivan and is accidentally murdered by his brother. Soon Lois finds a note written by Adam and presses the group to know what happened in Vegas. What will happen to them?Very Bad Things is one of the darkest comedies ever. The storyline of a group of friends that accidentally kills a woman is not original and has been used many times for example the 1997 lowbudget Stag. However Very Bad Things by Peter Berg has improved the story and is little gem of black humor. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Uma Loucura de Casamento A Crazzy Wedding".

It's uncomfortable and it's fascinating.Very Bad Things is a cautionary tale about the war of the sexes the battle of consumerism. It's about collateral damage Friendly fire is liable to take out just about anyone in the suburbs if a wedding is at stake! It's about people who have lost heart who have forgotten what's really important.Five male friends are off to Las Vegas for a stag party. The bride stays home to continue the wedding preparations to plan her day of days. Accidentally the boys kill a prostitute in their hotel room and decide to hush it up bury her in the desert to avoid the unpleasantness of an investigation. And then the body count mounts.The boys and later just as viciously the bride take the pragmatic road. That same let's get on with business people don't matter sort of morality that will allow a President to lie to Congress and get away with it cricket champions to cheat and then be made Captain politicians to sacrifice their citizens for the sake of overseas companies and murder to be acceptable as long as no one finds out about it. It's not how you play the game but you must win.The boys are pretty average types really except for Robert Boyd Christian Slater who was let out of prison to do the shoot!!!. Robert Boyd is a Men's Support Group graduate. He's into self fulfilment and asserting himself but is also the catalyst that tips these average men into horror. The other dominant personality is the bride Laura played by Cameron Diaz There's Something About Mary. Her single mindedness is astounding. Cameron Diaz is an astounding actress! Watch her eyes.But what is  average in these suburbs. And what about the pressures that go with paying the mortgage and keeping the wife happy? Very Bad Things finishes with a slow overhead shot of the suburb that has become hell for this lot. The tones are dirty grey. The mood is bleak and hopeless. The residents have sold their souls for a white minivan and a posh wedding.  The pressures of keeping up with the Jones have had casualties.There are continual references to being 'a loser' in the film. Even Kyle's Dad in the Toast To The Groom at the wedding refers vividly to his son's dismal failure as a school football player. The men are liable to crack.Very Bad Things is about the pressure cooker male bread winners are living in.  The fear of failure is lurking menacingly near by. The men in the film appear to be doing reasonably well from a fiscal point of view but when the pressure rises the girl in the hotel room dies horrible things happen with Boyd egging them on.The editing is ferocious the characters are vivid and the mood is very wry indeed. Don't expect to laugh much but hell paying the mortgage isn't much fun either.Men have been reacting to the mess they are in in the 90's but I would say that writerdirector Peter Berg doesn't think much of Men's self help groups. Slater's Robert Boyd has twisted self assertiveness to his own ends. These suburbanites commit horrendous crimes but still we should all consider what the men in Very Bad Things are up against.The phrase you do love me don't you from the women in their lives has never sounded more manipulative.".

Why does that suck?? 1st off not everyone dies. Some live to WISH they died but everyone dies in lets say Reservoir dogs and that movie is BRILLIANT!!I think what most people's problem with this movie was that it made them uncomfortable. If you dislike movies that make you stir in your seat not cause it blows but because the content is subversive then stay away. If you like dark comedies with an allstar ensemble and tense gruesome yet strangely funny scenes then watch this. You will not be let down.The only comment I will say is the yelling and screaming scenes got to be a bit much at times but it's excusable considering what's happening to these people as the movie plays it totally straight faced.8.5 out of 10".

Granted Tanya's acting ability at this time in her life needed a lot of work. I'm sure the producers knew this going in and didn't care. They knew the attraction would be to watch Sheena doing her thing in her jungle outfit. Tanya was the perfect choice considering the reason for the film.

Granted Tanya's acting ability at this time in her life needed a lot of work. I'm sure the producers knew this going in and didn't care. They knew the attraction would be to watch Sheena doing her thing in her jungle outfit. Tanya was the perfect choice considering the reason for the film.

This is a family adventure film that is most of all fun where the children seem to enjoy it equally as well as the adults.  Children like things that are pretty and this includes people so Tanya Robert's natural beauty is appealing to children too on a more simpler level.  Yes there is a little violence of the adventure film variety but not grotesquely frightenly or sickenly so. The same can be said about the display of skin which is never shown to be associated with sex or violence.  What a concept!  Thank you!  Yes there are two scenes where Tanya Roberts is fully nude one of Sheena showering under a waterfall and another of Sheena walking across the screen to bathe in a pond.  But they are so natural and appropriate especially for children that I have to applaud the screenwriter for creating these two scenes in lieu of the usual stupid reasons movie makers have to include nude scenes.

They must have gone to some length to get all of the animals into this film so that may explain the lack of budget for anything else. Like maybe some bad guys that can shoot straight. Watch it for Tanya and pretend the rest doesn't exist it's hard but try. The leading man is horrible. He is not even likable in the least. There was a nice Range Rover in the movie and the befuddle side kick of a camera man was slightly entertaining but that was it. Why go all the way to Africa to film this schlock. Just put Tanya in some tight leather and let her be Beastmaster of Iowa or something.".

This version of Sheena the story closely analogous to Tarzan was not done very well in 1984. Soso dialog unconvincing love scenes truck and helicopter crash and burn scenes.  It would be interesting to see Sheena made in the 21st century with good writing and directing. It could be a good film although Tarzan has been done so well so many times what's the use? There is only one reason to see Sheena and that is to appreciate Tanya Roberts very striking and not a bad actress at all.  I don't understand why she never got good roles.".

However with the acting I just don't know if that was her natural abilities shinning through because it seemed to be taking a lot out of her with her constant head grabbing. No that's right she's telepathically communicating with the animals ala The Beastmaster. As for the film itself of epic proportions. Director John Guillermin kind of shoots himself in the foot. The material tries to be fashionable with it's comicbook origins that's based upon S.M. Eiger and Will Eisner's comic strip books Sheena Queen of the Jungle but transcends into campy goofiness and lazy storytelling with an awkward sexual allurement. I don't know who this was aimed at. It pushes the boundaries of juvenile silliness that seems to be aimed at children but its free flowing ta thankyou to a nekid Tanya rules out that possibility. But how this one has a family feel to it. The action setpieces are often poorly staged and eyeboggling with a rough around the edges quality coming through. Other than Roberts being pretty much eyecandy the stunning Kenya locations managed to give the film a sense of place with Pasqualino De Santis' handsome widescreen photography being smoothly protracted. On the other side of the coin Richard Hartley's music score was relatively hamfisted and outofplace. Even the script tackles many issues in a tacky forced onenote mode that's quite ribtickling or painstaking depending on the mood of the viewer. The romance between Roberts and Wass is pitiful. Starring opposite of Roberts is Ted Wass who's capably charming in his role. Donovan Scott is given free reign in the comic part. I don't think this film is that awful as its made out to be but it has quite a few bad elements that'll give it a hard time in trying to fight off that stinker tag. At least the laughs keep on coming. Unintentional or not is the question?".

Vic joins forces with Sheena and does his best to keep Otwani and his invaders from turning Z'kuru into a desolate wasteland. Tanya Roberts looked ravishing she puts Tarzan into shame. And the way she uses her mental power was awesome. The countessFrance Zobda was a little more greedy than Otwani. The flamingo scene was outrageous and beautiful at the same time. Vic knows the truth about the soil that healed him from the wreck At least he also know about respect about the country it came from. Saving life is one thing saving a country is another. He would not exploit Sheena or Z'kuru to outsiders because there will be greedy people wanting to get their hands on the land. Probably greedier than Otwani. Despite the nudity Sheena is a good movie. maybe not for young kids that could be watch as a family though. A very powerful movie as well. A real gem there! 5 stars!".

	schema:reviewBody "This often maligned movie is my personal film classic. I saw it in 1984 at a drivein theater and now you've got to take my country into account. South Africa with its Draconian censorship laws still in full force with the emphasis on force so there was no nudity. There were lots of promotional photographs of the bikini beauty in the press when it was released but the poster was relatively subdued bikini beauty yes but mostly an adventurous image rather than something pinup. Anyway I went to see the pretty girl and got to see a fun movie with likable characters. Okay so there are the corny bits such as Sheena's callingtheelephants stance. But it's all wonderful fun! And that theme music! Okay so what if it's a striped pony? Hell I didn't come to see a zebra. Hell if you are after a real zebra might I suggest National Geographic? Off you go then!That scene where she wakes up next to him the next morning wow can anybody ever be that perfect in real life? I had it copied onto VHS and became even better friends with the guy who did it for me as a favor. We shared similar tastes. He was by the way the projectionist at this drivein. I then discovered through this video rental the nude scenes. But it was a muchabused original and my copy of course looked weak.Years later and after an initial struggle I have it on DVD. I well remember it was Sunday 22 January 2010. Movie night! Finally SHEENA! In all her splendor! First as a child !! Wow pretty kids! Really pretty wellchosen children but very surprising all that nudity not that I myself see anything wrong with that quite the opposite it is healthy and natural BUT WE ALL KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE and I suppose there were at least some outcry in the Puritanical regions. Then gloriously Tanya Roberts all golden mane and long legs and curves everywhere one stunning example of young maidenhood and now fully exposed on equally glorious DVD! I could have wept with happiness!I have since also obtained the Gena Lee Nolan TV series and will be reviewing that in the near future but Tanya Roberts is my particular favorite. Granted if Gena Lee 'didn't waste her time on BAYWATCH' not that I really really mean that for she was the best bird of the lot and if SHEENA the TV series came along sooner she'd have been in her absolute prime. But that's for another review.The action scenes are well done and that military convoy looks great on the screen. Oh that old toothlesslooking circus lion was a letdown and the chimps corny as hell but who really cares when you've got such a feast of Grade A eyecandy? I also loved Sheena's way of talking. 'The water the wagons drink' 'his fermented buffalo milk will be your fermented buffalo milk' 'I see my death in your eyes' 'Vic Casey you are a giant' the list could go on and on. Tanya Roberts is by all accounts a difficult actress to work with and she really got canned for A VIEW TO A KILL but the initial haughtiness of her Sheena really made the character all the more tangible.The theme music during the opening credits and the dramatic climactic showdown deserves special mention. I have a huge TV with powerful stereo sound brag brag  and I go full blast!Please somebody Find This Healing Earth In Real Life?Go for it. Just leave your twobit movie critic attitude at the door. There are clearly many mistakes there was room for improvement but what was filmed remains well worth watching again and again to this day!Update 7 April 2017. Some thoughts on the Sheena subject after I've spent a considerable part of last month downloading pics of Sheena on DeviantArt. I will be forever divided in two here. For Sheena it goes Lean scantilyclad blond goddess the glorious animals the wonder of nature. Against it goes any muscular depiction which ruins it for me completely. My thoughts went back to the movie and I had the warmest warmest regard for Tanya Roberts. Even watched INNER SANCTUM. Say about her what you like you bunch of detractors out there I'll always judge her on what was delivered on the screen and The Lady Is A Goddess. So feel free to mock this 1984 title ridicule it all you want but of course as Wikipedia says the box office bomb had its success on home video in the privacy of people's homes yeah of course. I rest my case. I will take it even further though. I will go as far as to say that there is something about the JeepLandroverwhatever  zebra chase scene with the bow and arrow and that music that is just... words fail me... it will just stay with me forever. If a bit of nudity caused people to turn against it a la SHOWGIRLS then all the more reason for it to be seen in a more enlightened age. The kind of nudity here is pretty as a postcard. If anybody is offended by it I AM OFFENDED MUCH MORE DEEPLY BY THAT KIND OF PERSON.What a relief to have this funfilled jewel on DVD despite the bickering hordes bringing it down.".

	onyx:emotionText "This often maligned movie is my personal film classic. I saw it in 1984 at a drivein theater and now you've got to take my country into account. South Africa with its Draconian censorship laws still in full force with the emphasis on force so there was no nudity. There were lots of promotional photographs of the bikini beauty in the press when it was released but the poster was relatively subdued bikini beauty yes but mostly an adventurous image rather than something pinup. Anyway I went to see the pretty girl and got to see a fun movie with likable characters. Okay so there are the corny bits such as Sheena's callingtheelephants stance. But it's all wonderful fun! And that theme music! Okay so what if it's a striped pony? Hell I didn't come to see a zebra. Hell if you are after a real zebra might I suggest National Geographic? Off you go then!That scene where she wakes up next to him the next morning wow can anybody ever be that perfect in real life? I had it copied onto VHS and became even better friends with the guy who did it for me as a favor. We shared similar tastes. He was by the way the projectionist at this drivein. I then discovered through this video rental the nude scenes. But it was a muchabused original and my copy of course looked weak.Years later and after an initial struggle I have it on DVD. I well remember it was Sunday 22 January 2010. Movie night! Finally SHEENA! In all her splendor! First as a child !! Wow pretty kids! Really pretty wellchosen children but very surprising all that nudity not that I myself see anything wrong with that quite the opposite it is healthy and natural BUT WE ALL KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE and I suppose there were at least some outcry in the Puritanical regions.

Often sequels seem like a cheap way to extract more life out of popular characters by forcing the through fresh adventures which they either do not fit without contrivance or which merely copy their previous escapades. 'Internal Affairs 2' however is an exception. The first movie in this series was a complex thriller that was presented as the end game in a long battle between the Hong Kong police and criminal gangs but the back story was only hinted at. This movie actually a prequel tells tells that story in such a way that it stands completely alone and remains interesting although the audience already knows the ultimate ending indeed is arguably even more interesting because we know where the tale must end. One reason it works is because the film has different ambitions to its predecessor that was a straightforward thriller of the highest order whereas this film no less good is more character driven and takes a wider perspective on Hong Kong society in general. Although the first movie was compared by some to Michael Mann's 'Heat' in fact it is this film that better bears the comparison as a tale of adversaries on opposite sides of the law and it stands up to that comparison well the subtle behaviours of the heroes and villains alike more interesting than the macho posturings of the gangsters and cops depicted in American movies. The only disappointment is the absence of Tony Leung from the original cast but it's rare that two movies in a series are as complementary and as good as these two.".

One reason it works is because the film has different ambitions to its predecessor that was a straightforward thriller of the highest order whereas this film no less good is more character driven and takes a wider perspective on Hong Kong society in general. Although the first movie was compared by some to Michael Mann's 'Heat' in fact it is this film that better bears the comparison as a tale of adversaries on opposite sides of the law and it stands up to that comparison well the subtle behaviours of the heroes and villains alike more interesting than the macho posturings of the gangsters and cops depicted in American movies. The only disappointment is the absence of Tony Leung from the original cast but it's rare that two movies in a series are as complementary and as good as these two.";

	schema:reviewBody "After phenomenal success of Wu Jian Dao 2002 or IA for short a lot of hypes generated around when next two movies in the series are announced. I tend to ignore them and do not expect anything about IA2. Before I got into the cinema how would the screenwriters present this timeand how would they connect the characters between them?. After the movie I would say I am not disappointed.Like IA this is also a drama about clashes of characters not in the form of breathtaking kung fu  wirework actions we find in traditional Hong Kong cop movie but starting from their own desire intentions hate and positions. If you are looking for a nonstop action flick I am afraid IA2 would not fulfill you.But unlike last year's blockbuster the main theme of IA2 is about the rise and fall of a great gangster family Ngai other than about the police. The difficult part in making a prequel lies in the fact that as audiences all know too well the new appearences would dropout one way or the other and the characters from IA must be okay. So the story does not waste efforts in describing most of the adventures rather concentrate on how these events shapes things to come. It is sure to the scriptwrites' credits and this alone casts a strong contrast to prequel movies like Star Wars Attack of the Clones 2002.Moreover it is not surprising for many audiences relating this with similar movies like The Godfather.  I am not comparing them here but rather I would point out that the actor Francis Ng who plays the new gangster head of Nagi family runs the show.  He plays a young welleducated coolcalculating witted cruel cunning  and unpredictable leader. As some critics say a CEOstyle triad boss. On the other hand he successfully shows Ngai is actually a passionate man whose family comes first. On the other hand late gang leader is screened for one shot only pun intended his character is only reflected not by flashbacks but by short monologues recited by Ng. It is a quite demanding job and I would say Ng has done a really good job here.Speaking of characters another drift from IA and many other traditional movies in the genre female character actually plays real effects. Mary played by Claudia Lau is the closest girlfriend of Sam Hung. She is not just a powerless declorative character. Like many female in the course of human history she is the ignition point of the whole storm.If the audiences has not forgotten IA actually hints that Inspector Wong played by awardwinning Anthony Wong and Sam Hung played by also awardwinning Eric Tsang have known each other for a long time. IA2 unveils their longtime mutual respects and how all these change as the story flows along. Anthony Wong still delivers a high standard of acting just like in IA and how he plays the 3 upsanddowns of Inspector Wong is simply terrific. On the contary gangster Hung Wong's archenemy in IA is much lighter and more human.  As with Wong this character experiences changes which shapes of what to be seen in IA. However I find the last party scene is unnecessary and does not seem to connect with the firece and uncanny Hung we used to know.Relatively the other major characters seems week. Mainland actor Jun Wu plays another inspector who is a close partner with Wong. I could see the actor tries. Unfortunately Wu's character is just too flat. His friendship and his clashes with Wong could not mark strong impressions among the audiences. I have a probably false feeling that this character is created to be destroyed and it is a waste of Wu's talents.The actors portriating the young Wingyan Chan by Shawn Yu and Kinming Lau by Edison Chan would be the weakest link in IA2. Except for a few scene Edison puts up a regular expression of somewhat between arragonce and anger. For example towards the end of airport scene Lau would have a mixed feeling of guilt anger loss and vengence. This is an important scene for Lau's selfcentered character however the actor simply fails to convince me.The same goes to Shawn. He fails to play as someone who is torn between his role as a policeman and a triad member his loyalty and duty.  Most of the time he just plays plain and flat faced. To be fair he gets a tad better towards the end of the movie as his character begins to merge with the character in IA.Nonetheless young actors weight must less as the others.Speaking about continuity IA2 does not fail in providing bits and pieces about the backstory of IA. And it is not hard for anyone to catch the images of other minor characters from IA. However I have a few issues.First in IA we see Hung was an ambitious and man of vision that is why he implants many moles in the police department in the first place. However the initial character of Hung seems too soft and passive. Why does he stand by Ngai in the time of crisis?  We could not see his importance rises afterwards. Why didn't he use the chance and take out his opponents or expand his influence in the triad then? Was he just covering himself for his longterm plan?Also why Wingyan Chan remains in the end even in light of his wellknown ties with the Ngai family? How come does he becomes a subordinate of Keung? In IA the position of Keung and Yan seems to have switched.Apart from some goofs accuracy of shooting from a paper bag ignorance of emptied handgun and way of corspes could be burnt to ashes the run of the movie stops rather abruptedly twice as timeline transits from year 1991 to 1995 and from 1995 to 1997. The effects on and changes of characters are not appearent so it leaves the audiences with a lot of imaginations and mental exercises. Not that I hate mental exercises it is rare for Hong Kong movies to make me enjoy doing so I think the director could handle the storytelling a bit better smoother and tighter.Despite of cliches IA2 delivers a more powerful drama than the original. The acting directing and many other technical aspects are top notch. The scriptwriters are very clever in telling from the other side of the theme and breaks away the shadow casted by the successful predecessor.Looking forward to see the real final this December.810".

	schema:headline " Deserving prequel";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers Warning !!!Infernal Affair created a box office miracle in Hong Kong last year not because it is a particularly brilliant film but because of the lame comparisons that went on before. Still I.A. is a solid piece of work which coupled with the hype that has been building up becomes quite an act to follow. For I.A. 2 the scriptwriters' task is to strike a good balance of giving a life of its own and yet preserving an adequate link with the first one. The challenge is compounded by the fact that this is a prequel dictating that the audience would know that the people they've seen before are not going to die here a rather irritating handicap for a crime story.The scriptwriters met this challenge with a combination of strategies. First borrow the main plot of underworld feud from The Godfather. Next add a story line of an entrancing woman and cast an entrancing actress for the role. Then package the story into an ensemble type of performance arena where the audience can enjoy watching a good number of different roles major as well as minor. Finally move the story towards a monumental backdrop the return of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. The result an immensely watchable movie and a deserving prequel to the first Infernal Affair. While I.A. 2 does not pretend to be a Godfather' the movie does earn our respect right from the opening shots by demonstrating the meticulous efforts put into its production. Anthony Wong seems to be delivering a monologue but is actually talking with Eric Tsang in a spartanly furnished room. Facing Wong on the far wall hangs a clock. As Wong's is shot from various angles the tictoc sound of the clock moves around the cinema left right front and back in relation to the angle of the shot. This is the technical aspect. This opening dialogue is also of paramount importance as it underpins the main theme of this prequel. What Wong says here explains his dark side not seen in I.A. 1 in a startling revelation later. In the brief synopsis that follows I'll continue to use the performers' names instead of the characters' for simplicity.synopsis startsThe story happens in three time slots 1991 1995 and 1997 aptly correlated with the size of the mobile phones seen in the movie. Young Edison Chan's assassination of an underworld boss makes a blood bath seem unavoidable in sparkling a feud among four lieutenants. However thing are swiftly brought under control at the emergence of the victim's son Francis Ng who skilfully manipulating the four put them in their place again. There is actually a fifth Eric Tsang who has been most loyal to the dead boss. The irony is that the killing has been ordered secretly by his woman Carina Lau who thinks that Tsang should really be the man at the top. On the law enforcers' side Anthony Wong sets up Shawn Yu Tong Leung in I.A. 1 as a mole in Ng's gang knowing that Yu is actually Ng's halfbrother but trusting his intention to be a good man'. At the same time Chan Andy Lau in I.A. 1 joins the police force as the gangster's undercover as we have already seen in I.A. 1. Fast forward 4 years we see Ng ready to clean up his house by getting rid of the four' taking Tsang into his confidence. A startling revelation is now made to the audience while Lau ordered the assassination 4 years ago she had a corroborator inspector Wong. Ng has actually found out about this and vows to revenge his beloved father's death on both Lau and Tsang even though he knows that the latter was really innocent. On the pretext of sending Tsang to Thailand to set up some cocaine business Ng intends to send him to meet his death. Simultaneously by a brilliant double play he eliminates the four' and at the same time reveals to the police evidence of Wong's conspiracy in killing his father. We then see Tsang in a tight spot in Thailand but are not shown what eventually happens. In Hong Kong Chan who has all this time been a secret admirer of Lau shields her from Ng's revenge Ng does not know that Chan is the actual killer of his father. But when he fails to win her heart Chan betrays Lau sending her to her death in the hands of Ng's gunmen.In 1997 approaching Hong Kong's historical moment Wong is pardoned by the police as they need capable men like him to continue combating the underworld. He goes to Thailand to see Tsang whom we find had not been killed after all. In this prequel they are friends despite being in opposite camps and have a common enemy in Ng. Back in Hong Kong they continue to try to spin web around Ng but find that all they have been able to lay their hands on will only put him behind bars for a few years which is clearly not enough for Tsang for avenging his woman. Without going into details it suffices to say that Tsang manages a plot that corners Ng getting him eventually killed by the police.synopsis endsIn this brief synopsis I have left out a lot of details as well as some characters such as To Manchat who plays a less comic role here than in I.A. 1 and Wu Jun mainland Chinese star playing Wong's partner and buddy. I want to mention also Roy Cheung one of the five gunmen in Johnny To's masterpiece The Mission' 1999 who without a single line here has such a screen presence that leaves quite an impression.I mentioned at the beginning that the main challenge of this movie is to strike a balance between having its own life and yet maintaining a link with I.A. 1. Let's look at each of these two aspects.The new life is in the two new characters who could easily have been in a different story. The beauty is that they can be killed off and they both ended up exactly that way and the audience would expect some deaths in a crime yarn. Ng's story line as mentioned is primarily from Godfather. Ng well known for his explosive screen image is a completely different man here composed calculating and it does not take a film critic or movie reviewer to see the resemblance to Michael Corleone. His story fuels the main plot of I.A. 2 giving it a life independent from the first one. Complementing this independence is Carina Lau who adds glamour as well as femininity to enrich the movie's content. The scantily depicted but genuinely felt love between the visually most unlikely pair of Lau and Tsang is actually quite moving.As to the link with the first one the 4 key characters  Wong Tsang Chan young Andy Lau and Yu young Tony Leung  have received varying treatments. Unlike before or afterwards if that make more sense to your temporal awareness Wong and Tsang are friends here. I think this arrangement is quite deliberate for the obvious reason that watching them in the same old conflict as in I.A. 1 wouldn't exactly be a thrill to the audience. Tsang plays a much more passive and subdued role throughout most of the movie. It isn't until after Lau has been killed by Ng that he fires up. Wong on the other hand is much more controversial displaying a dark side of his character which the movie tries to explain in his opening dialogue about witnessing on his first beat the violent death of his superior under the hands of a mobster. The situation reminds me of the old Hollywood westerns in which the invariable commandment was thou shalt not take the law into thy own hands' no matter how evil the criminal is. Wong gnawed by the torturing frustration from seeing the killer freed after just a few years does take the law into his own hands. Of the two young ones Edison Chan has considerably more to do in depicting the formation of Andy Lau's character. Chan has displayed a maturing selfassurance particularly in that charming almost childlike smile behind which hides a chilling soul. Shawn Yu on the other hand does not leave that much of an impression.One more point and I'm done. The makers of the movie spared no pain in employing a staggering variety of background music. Choral chants are used lavishly as are solo piano and guitar. Pulsating strings and urgent percussions are employed as usual in building up climaxes. Even the harmonic comes into play and this one actually on screen at the conclusion of the extermination of the four'. If I seem to make it sound as though background music has been over used this is not my intention. Rather they are employed skilfully and tastefully contributing considerably to the success of the movie.".

	schema:headline " Interesting  a very different movie from the first film but sadly an inferior one too";
	schema:reviewBody "Set before events in Wu Jian Dao the murder of the head of the Ngai family see his son Hau stepping up  immediately upsetting the power balance in the region. Small time boss Sam has a close relationship with officer SP Wong both of whom wish to see the Ngai family removed from the scene. Meanwhile triad Lau Kin Ming is sent to infiltrate the police force and gradually work his way up with help from Sam while Wong sanctions Chen Wing Yan the half brother of the Hgai family to infiltrate the triads and work his way up to Hau.I approached this film wondering what it would do  how would it manage to be interesting given that we already know from part 1 how it goes. I also expected it to be roughly the same as the first film in terms of being an enjoyable thriller  however this was not the case and it was hard to get into the film for what it was. The story is not really about Yan and Ming so much as it is about the leading figures behind them  this film belongs to Sam Wong and Hau and this was a bit of a surprise but one I was able to get over quickly and settle into a pretty interesting story where we see the shift of power in the HK crime families  unsurprisingly framed by the shift of political power from Britain to China. However interesting it is the film lacks in several areas. Firstly the praise for the first film seems to have got to the makers' heads and part 2 is a much more overblown affair that injects every scene with a sense of overblown drama that it tries to create as oppose to earn. This is a little tiring as it seems to be forcing us to accept the film as some sort of epic where it would have been much more effective to underplay the story and let it stand on its own. Making this more annoying is the fact that the script doesn't really help the audience much and only the sharpest viewer will make it through the first 20 minutes without struggling to get hold of the story and work out who everybody is. In stark contrast to the tight thriller of part 1 this film is a much bigger story and as such occasionally struggled to keep me emotionally involved. Sure the politics of crime were interesting and produced plenty of good stuff but only occasionally did I get behind the characters and struggle to know who to support like I had in part 1  in fact the film could have easily lost Yan and Ming without losing much story. However it is still worth seeing as it does manage as a bit of a twisty crime story but not a thriller but even as this it doesn't really stand out as being that great. The loss of the great performances from Lau and Leung is a massive hole that neither Chen or Yue ever get close to filling  the fact that the material gives them no help either is not their fault. As before Wong and Tsang are both good and they benefit from being the focus of the prequel. Ng is a good addition as Hau and he is suitably professional cold and has a powerful presence suiting his character  it also helps that he was very easy on the eye too! As with the prequel the female parts are pretty thin and the potential to use Lau's Mary better is not taken.Overall this is not a bad film by any means in fact it is an OK story of crime between the ruling families as shown by a few individuals however the film hurts itself by trying to force itself into the shape of a 'sprawling crime epic' when nothing in the material actually justifies this aim. The poor use of Yan and Ming is a problem that is only slightly helped by the increased focus on Sam and SP Wong. An OK film but not a scratch on the original and not even necessary viewing to enjoy that better film.".

The beginning was a complete mess strange new faces appearing all over each seemingly important but felt like a total stranger.

	schema:reviewBody "INFERNAL AFFAIRS 2 the prequel to the popular film from 2002 is a bloated movie trying to make its way into epic status. The film runs almost 2 hours long is at least 30 minutes too long and too many characters are introduced leaving the original two leads  the two people the film is supposed to be exploring  standing in the background with nothing much to do. One of the main character commits a murder in the beginning that sets off a gangland war but other than that the two main characters could have been excised completely from the film. In a nutshell INFERNAL AFFAIRS 2 is THE GODFATHER 2 but with Chinese actors and triads instead of mafiosos. Narratively the two films are identical and the writers of IA 2 even reuses elements and sequences made popular in that other film. It's not very hard to spot but I guess we can count is as homage rather than theft. Perhaps.In any rate IA 2 is a good enough movie but in truth it really shouldn't have been called IA 2 or a prequel to the far superior INFERNAL AFFAIRS. As another movie entirely without relations to INFERNAL AFFAIRS IA 2 would have been quite a terrific film.

	onyx:emotionText "INFERNAL AFFAIRS 2 the prequel to the popular film from 2002 is a bloated movie trying to make its way into epic status. The film runs almost 2 hours long is at least 30 minutes too long and too many characters are introduced leaving the original two leads  the two people the film is supposed to be exploring  standing in the background with nothing much to do. One of the main character commits a murder in the beginning that sets off a gangland war but other than that the two main characters could have been excised completely from the film. In a nutshell INFERNAL AFFAIRS 2 is THE GODFATHER 2 but with Chinese actors and triads instead of mafiosos. Narratively the two films are identical and the writers of IA 2 even reuses elements and sequences made popular in that other film. It's not very hard to spot but I guess we can count is as homage rather than theft. Perhaps.In any rate IA 2 is a good enough movie but in truth it really shouldn't have been called IA 2 or a prequel to the far superior INFERNAL AFFAIRS.

While there were action scenes and a lot of shooting it did seem hard to follow with no real continuity between the scenes. What I gathered was that this movie begins in 1993 and leads up to the hand over of Hong Kong to the Chinese where it ends though this event is only in the background.This movie follows the story of a police officer whose goal is to bring down the triad family the Ngai before the handover of power but in doing so sees many of his colleges killed. However within the Ngai family the patriarch has died which has left the family in a vacuum and the various sons are all wrestling for control. While this is happening one of the sons is expelled from the police force due to his family connections but is then recruited by another officer to infiltrate the family and collect evidence and his reward is a position as a police officer.As mentioned this movie was quite confusing difficult to follow and seemed to have too much going on at once with too many characters. While things do become clear as one gets to the end of the film the movie does drag on quite a bit and once the end arrives you feel glad that it has.".

	schema:reviewBody "Infernal Affairs 2 was a completely unnecessary prequel to the fantastic Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. While the story is quite good it suffers in many ways. First the two leads from the original film are not in this film though many of the other actors are. Second because you've already seen Infernal Affairs there is no sense of suspense and you KNOW how the big battle between the mob bosses must end. And third it does nothing to further the story from the first filmjust fill in some missing pieces that were just as well left missing.This story picks up as the two leads from the first film Inspector Lau Kin Ming and Chen Yan enter the academy. However Inspector Lau Kin Ming is NOT a major player in the film at all...he's there in a few scenes but not much more. Instead it follows the path of Chen through the mob and shows the big shakeup that leaves Hon Sam in charge as he was in the first film. The only really interesting element is how Superintendent Wong Chi Shing mistakenly thought he could work with Hon Sam....something he'd regret by the end of the film.So you have an interesting story that is completely unnecessary if you've seen the previous film which almost all viewers probably have. It's well written and an interesting gangster saga....but I can't see how it was necessary for anything other than to suck more money out of the public who loved the first film. Perhaps I'll think more of the third film as it picks up just after the firsta much more logical place to begin.".

So I decided to sit down and watch it and it seems to me that they wanted to tell anything BUT an Infernal Affairs prequel and more of a cop drama about taking down a leader of the triads.The plot is that in 1991 after Lau Kin Ming from the first movie kills a man... Wait WHAT? Isn't the point of his character in the first movie supposed to be that he has no criminal record so nobody would suspect him? Anyway his son becomes a triad boss who can dig up every bit of personal information at the drop of a hat. Years later he begins to seize more power as Superintendent Wong from the first movie tries to stop him and put him away for life.Okay this movie goes way overthetop. Whenever some people die in this movie there's that music that means they want you to feel sad almost like you're meant to feel shocked that extra 12 got shot... Now with the first movie the deaths that were portrayed in that light worked because they were completely unexpected you got to know the characters even a little bit and they were major and memorable characters plus even though some might consider them as overthetop they at least fitted.Then there was the continuity errors. I said one being that Lau committed criminal acts in this one when the reason why he was chosen to be a mole in the Police Force was because they wouldn't suspect him among others. For example Wong and Chan's had a conversation that established that the only other person who knew his identity retired... YEAH! by being blown up in a car explosion. There are inconsistencies like that in this movie.I think this movie would have been a whole lot better if it was just a cop drama where the cops try and take down a triad leader. I know it would have been clichd but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it didn't have the Infernal Affairs name on it. I would say go watch it. There is a good movie behind the complaints I raised but the inconsistencies and how overthetop things are just drag it down.".

One of my Chinese friends who suggested the trilogy to me gave me part II first and said I could watch that before the original film but I waited until I could buy the entire trilogy and watch them all in order. As it turns out I may as well have listened to her. The premise is pretty much the same a police officer working undercover for a mafia godfather while the godfather has a trusted lieutenant working as a successful police inspector. Like the first film it is an interesting play in the space between breaking and protecting the law as each side is simultaneously living life as a criminal and law enforcement agent which is clearly a difficult task.There is an interesting backdrop of the film of the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 the 10 year anniversary of which I experienced here in central China last June. And let me tell you these people are really happy to have Hong Kong. They don't mess around with fireworks. For the Chinese New Year for example fireworks are set off almost nonstop for WEEKS. Trust me. I'm literally hearing the last of it outside my window at this very moment. None of this 30 minutes just after midnight nonsense!It's true that the sequel is slightly lesser than the brilliant first film but it is an engaging crime drama especially impressive because of the performances of Police Inspector Wong Anthony Wong and the gangster Sam Eric Tsang who were in charge of placing the moles on the opposing team you might say. They are good friends and seem to have an easy relationship except that each pretty much knows what the other is doing they just don't know everything. And like in the original this is a recipe for a pretty absorbing crime film.".

It does show that gangsters can be people too  even the most ruthless of them. I suppose that the only complaint that I have is that while the Andy Lau or will be Andy character looks a lot like him the Tony Leung character does not. I have to say that the screenplay for this film as it the case with the first one is very strong and deals with the character development in a way that I've not seen in any other Chinese movie. I actually cringe at what Scorcese might make of this series. He's a fine teacher but as a director he's been doing junk for quite a while.".

A huge fan of Humphrey Bogart Allen soon looks to an imaginary incarnation of Bogie to guide his fearful and clumsy voyage back into the single life.  He is aided by his best friend Dick and his wife Linda Woody regulars Tony Roberts and Diane Keaton who assist him in setting up one disastrous date after another.  Soon enough Woody discovers that sometimes you actually find true love but it doesn't always work out the way you wish.Personally I don't care too much for the whole Bogartasmentor thing.  I spend most of the film cracking up at Woody's clumsy gestures and neurotic naysayings.  As usual in an Allen film Keaton gives a sweet selfeffacing performance.  Because the film was directed by Herbert Ross the typical rambling dialogue and backandforth editing is toned down a bit so for an Allen vehicle the movie feels more mannered and has more of a narrative strength than Woody's other wacky 70's productions.  Still Woody has never made me laugh harder  ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "What could be cooler than having a screen legend hanging out with you offering you dating tips? This classic 1972 comedy written by and starring Woody Allen gives him two one the specter of Humphrey Bogart the other a young Diane Keaton just working her way into film.Woody plays Allan Felix a film critic who has just been dumped by his wife and sets off to fill the hole in his heart. I'll get broads in here like you wouldn't believe he tells himself. Swingers freaks nymphomaniacs dental hygienists. But when even the nymphomaniac complains about his getting fresh he realizes it won't be so easy. Enter Bogart appearing in a series of fantasy sequences and Keaton very much a part of his real life as onehalf of the married couple that jumps in to help Allan out. Alone amongst women she can see Allan as a worthwhile guy especially with their shared love for apple juice and Darvon.Play It Again Sam is a bit of an anomaly for an Allen comedy. It's set in San Francisco not New York and is directed by Herbert Ross rather than Allen himself. But it's very funny kind of poignant and a clever way of examining the foibles of hooking up circa the 1970s. A number of comic vignettes examine the various ways seeking out the opposite sex can go wrong on the dance floor in a Chinese restaurant in a bar. My favorite has to be the museum hottie with the pneumatic voice Only an Allen movie would have its best punchline be about committing suicide.The central point of the film as brought out by another apparition only Allan sees his exwife is that the world is broken up into watchers and doers and Allan the film critic is too much the former. Bogie gives him much the same advice but Bogie and the exwife don't exactly get along in Allan's daydreams leading to awkward moments. Don't listen to him! Don't listen to her! Fellas we're in a supermarket.Besides as Allan notes it's one thing for Bogie to get slapped another thing for him Your glasses don't go flying across the room.Other than Annie Hall and Sleeper this is the best of the early Woody Allen comedies another way of saying the best of Woody Allen. Ross's unpretentious style keeps the focus on the humor and the performances and even makes Allen seem a gifted physical comedian which he isn't. Keaton is a terrific foil for Allen both platonically and as it turns out otherwise while Tony Roberts as her husband this being his first of many Allen films too makes for a wry straight man with his constant phone calls and his appearances in some fun fantasy sendups the best of them in Italian.You really like the characters in this one. Empathy can be a powerful weapon in comedy something Woody apparently forgot as he moved into his Bergman phase. The ending is neat without being satisfying the dream sequences aren't used to their full potential and some of the rape jokes sound really bad all these years later. But you laugh a lot watching this film a nice vehicle for Woody's observational humor and for seeing the game of love played in its most ineptly enjoyable form.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of Woody Allen. While his films often have something wrong with them you can always count on a good time and a laugh while you're watching  and that's certainly what you get here! Woody Allen films are always best when Woody himself stars in them his neurotic persona is a great base for laughs and he certainly delivers in this film! For some reason Woody Allen chose not to direct this film himself and Herbert Ross has got that job. Due to the cast and Woody's script however this is very much another Woody Allen flick no matter who is in the director's chair. This film also features the first screen pairing of Allen and Diane Keaton who would of course go on to make Allen's masterpiece 'Annie Hall' along with Tony Roberts who also costars here. The plot of the movie plays out like a tribute to Casablanca and it sees recently dumped Allen falling in love with his best friend's wife all the while under the watchful eye of the great Humphrey Bogart whom he sees in his daydreams.The humour in this film is awesome and also amazingly funny. Scenes that see Woody Allen blunder his way through dates are hilarious and Allen's dialogue is at its dry and witty peak. The scene in which he tells of a fight he had with two 'hairdressers' being an excellent example of his writing. Allen tends to play the same sort of character in all of his films and the one here shows him doing that again. This would be a problem if he weren't so amazingly good at it. As the man festers in his own pathos we can really believe it and this gives the film a great sense of believability and also offers up a prime example of Allen acting at his best. The film isn't a complete oneman show however as the underrated Tony Roberts along with Diane Keaton also give grand performances. The movie tributes in the film are many with most pointing to the great Casablanca  and this is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. On the whole this is an intelligent entertaining and hilarious movie from one of cinema's best comedians. Highly recommended!".

His friends Linda Diane Keaton and her husband Dick Tony Roberts try to help him finding available acquaintances to date him. Allan is advised by his alter ego Bogart Jerry Lacy how to behave with women but Allan is too weird and the women never go in a second date with him. Soon Allan finds that he is in love with Linda but Dick is his best friend and he does not want to make a move despite Bogart advices. Play It Again Sam is one of the best romantic comedies by Woody Allen in the beginning of his successful career. I saw this movie for the first time when I was still discovering Woody Allen and last time I had seen was on VHS on 12 November 2000 and I have just seen it again on a DVD recently released in Brazil. The neurotic Allan is hilarious and his discussions with Linda about neurosis and medicines and his jitters with his dates are very funny. It is curious also to see the typical New Yorker Woody Allen filming in San Francisco. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Sonhos de um Sedutor Dreams of a Seductor".

One of my favorite scenes is Woody trying to meet an attractive woman at a museum.  She turns out to be a little more unhappy than he is but is also very funny in her darkness. The very best is Woody getting set up on a blind date with Jennifer Salt. His nervousness will stay in your mind long after the movie is over.".

It may be advisable to watch it before seeing Allen's film mainly due to the frequent references and the story itself is a homage. Obviously the director's a big fan of Humphrey Bogart and perhaps he sees a lot of himself in the moviestar.The whimsical narrative structure follows Allen's usual style. The characters have also been witnessed in Allen's other films. Allen himself plays his signature neurotic persona rambling on about psychosexual stuff. Tony Roberts does a fine job as Linda's fianc who's usually absent when Linda needs him. Diane Keaton is outstanding. She looks stunning and her performance is excellently natural. Jerry Lacy does a good job of mimicking Bogart. In addition I liked the soundtrack and enjoyed the playful cinematography.This film is classic Allen a delight to watch.

Allen is playing has patented neurotic character but I've always found him funny and his disastrous dates are just great. Also him Keaton and Roberts always worked well together and it makes their relationship seem very believable.

	schema:reviewBody "This is Nancy Allan's exwife speaking and such a fascinatingly intriguing line that it totally distracted me from the breakup the belittling comments on Allan's sexual merits and all the pathos plunging Allan in the seminal state that forged the legend of Allen's characters hence the merely disguised similitude between the two names. Anyway I kept repeating in my mind one of life's great watchers.These words powerfully echo the opening scene when Allan is watching the legendary ending of Casablanca. His mouth agape makes you wonder whether he's mesmerized by the film or envious of the manly confidence Bogie exudes towering a weepy Bergman. When the lights of the theater are turned on and Allan gets back to the bitter reality his apartment gives the answer. It's a filmgeek's paradise full of Bogart's movie posters all about Bogart the screen star and macho icon everything AllanAllen is not.And this is the core of Allan's existential torments he loves movies because they vehicle the very emotions and feelings he wants to awaken in women. The constant hallucination of a Bogie with his legendary trench coat walking along Allan great impression by Jerry Lacy shows how predominant the Bogartfigure is in his life. The expression in Allan's face in the theater is of a young frail little boy who fantasizes about being the blonde stud getting the girl. The process works in reverse when he imagines Nancy Susan Anspach going in a motorcycle with a blonde and muscular biker the 'Nazitype' as he says.The core of Allan's insecurity is his total disillusion he knows a Bogie he's not ... or maybe he can try by watching films to grab some little bits of Bogie's aura play it like Bogart could have worked as another title and see if it works. Naturally the film is mostly funny when it doesn't.If not women Allan has two friends Dick Tony Roberts a fitting name for the workaholic real estate agent whose only running sometimes irritating gag consists on giving the phone number on each place he's in and Linda Diane Keaton a gentle and sensitive soul driven by a sort of maternal care toward Allan. Both try to connect Allan with their female acquaintances but the dates turn out to be totally disastrous. From an excessive use of Canoe perfume a nervous grunt meaning 'Hello' his lamentable attempts to impress by showing a sports medal he bought 20 or the unforgettable record thrown in the furniture the date is probably one of the funniest scenes from any Allen's films.Indeed Allen is never as hilarious as when he tries to impersonate what he's not and the more he tries to 'play it like Bogie' the funnier it gets. The film is pure Woody Allen in his most delightful selfloathing humor. And there's more than that if Play it Again Sam provides some good moments to laugh at Woody Allen it also vehicles the idea that he's never as 'attractive' as when he's natural granted he tries to find the right girl. And the story leaves some sweet hints of a genuine chemistry between Allan and Linda believable for the simple reason that with Linda he's being himself never tries to seduce her and therefore reaches the level of quiet and tacit appeal to make jealous any wannabe Bogie.As a romance and a comedy Play it Again Sam is a real gem. All the bits are unequally hilarious and we kind of see the ending and some other plot devices coming but they're continuously punctuated with hilarious oneliners. I reject before being rejected. It's a way to save time and money is one of these quotes that would make you laugh harder if they didn't touch a real sensitive chord. It's all about the quest of our own equilibrium on seduction without compromising ourselves on hiding our weaknesses while remaining true to our souls. When Allan finally gets to play the role of his alltime idol Bogie replaying the climax of Casablanca he precisely achieved his dream because he wasn't trying to be Bogie the arc was closed.Play it Again Sam is adapted on a Woody Allen's play and appropriately features all the Allenian trademarks selfderision ethnic references a cute and tender romance that foreshadows the best coming between Allen and Keaton in a way Play it Again Sam is like the ancestor of Annie Hall. And the more I watch Allen and Keaton's pairing the more I realize that the couple has nothing to envy from Bogart and Bergman Keaton has this incredible intellectual appeal that makes believable such a beautiful woman would be insecure. She doesn't overexpose her beauty and instead exudes the feeling of a fragile flower waiting to bloom on a man's heart the stuff that inspires Allan's own sensitivity.Herbert Ross who directed the film diluted his style into Allen's spirit using the town of San Francisco as the only unAllenian element of the film providing its rich and unique atmosphere. And as usual beyond the gags there's the eternal dedication of Allen to Cinema. I mentioned in Take the Money and Run that Cinema was the ultimate geek escapism. By playing it like Bogie Allan finally reconciles with his own selfesteem the point is that he learned that Bogart isn't a character it's a state of mind a readiness for having the guts to follow heart and instinct and sometimes even appease them for the right reasons.When he impersonated Bogie Allan was pathetic when he embraced his state of mind he was no more a loser. Maybe that's the greatest gift of Cinema providing some models not to impersonate but to inspire ourselves. I also believe that Cinema is the stuff dreams are made off and as one of 'life's great watchers' I sometimes wish I could have the same hallucinatory relationship with Michael Corleone.".

From an excessive use of Canoe perfume a nervous grunt meaning 'Hello' his lamentable attempts to impress by showing a sports medal he bought 20 or the unforgettable record thrown in the furniture the date is probably one of the funniest scenes from any Allen's films.Indeed Allen is never as hilarious as when he tries to impersonate what he's not and the more he tries to 'play it like Bogie' the funnier it gets. The film is pure Woody Allen in his most delightful selfloathing humor. And there's more than that if Play it Again Sam provides some good moments to laugh at Woody Allen it also vehicles the idea that he's never as 'attractive' as when he's natural granted he tries to find the right girl. And the story leaves some sweet hints of a genuine chemistry between Allan and Linda believable for the simple reason that with Linda he's being himself never tries to seduce her and therefore reaches the level of quiet and tacit appeal to make jealous any wannabe Bogie.As a romance and a comedy Play it Again Sam is a real gem. All the bits are unequally hilarious and we kind of see the ending and some other plot devices coming but they're continuously punctuated with hilarious oneliners. I reject before being rejected. It's a way to save time and money is one of these quotes that would make you laugh harder if they didn't touch a real sensitive chord. It's all about the quest of our own equilibrium on seduction without compromising ourselves on hiding our weaknesses while remaining true to our souls. When Allan finally gets to play the role of his alltime idol Bogie replaying the climax of Casablanca he precisely achieved his dream because he wasn't trying to be Bogie the arc was closed.Play it Again Sam is adapted on a Woody Allen's play and appropriately features all the Allenian trademarks selfderision ethnic references a cute and tender romance that foreshadows the best coming between Allen and Keaton in a way Play it Again Sam is like the ancestor of Annie Hall. And the more I watch Allen and Keaton's pairing the more I realize that the couple has nothing to envy from Bogart and Bergman Keaton has this incredible intellectual appeal that makes believable such a beautiful woman would be insecure. She doesn't overexpose her beauty and instead exudes the feeling of a fragile flower waiting to bloom on a man's heart the stuff that inspires Allan's own sensitivity.Herbert Ross who directed the film diluted his style into Allen's spirit using the town of San Francisco as the only unAllenian element of the film providing its rich and unique atmosphere. And as usual beyond the gags there's the eternal dedication of Allen to Cinema. I mentioned in Take the Money and Run that Cinema was the ultimate geek escapism. By playing it like Bogie Allan finally reconciles with his own selfesteem the point is that he learned that Bogart isn't a character it's a state of mind a readiness for having the guts to follow heart and instinct and sometimes even appease them for the right reasons.When he impersonated Bogie Allan was pathetic when he embraced his state of mind he was no more a loser. Maybe that's the greatest gift of Cinema providing some models not to impersonate but to inspire ourselves. I also believe that Cinema is the stuff dreams are made off and as one of 'life's great watchers' I sometimes wish I could have the same hallucinatory relationship with Michael Corleone.";

Woody Allen One of Woody Allen's best films precisely because it is directed not by Woody a visually inept director who thinks verbally more than visually but by Herbert Ross a director who lends some pace style movement and energy to Allen's charming and funny screenplay Play It Again Sam also marks the point at which Allen's films moved away from broad Marxbrothers inspired comedy to more introspective supposedly serious territory.The film stars Woody Allen as Allan Fellix a morose neurotic whiny inhibited nerdy angsty articulate cynical wormy socially and sexually maladjusted loser. He's your classic Woody Allen schmuck perpetually trapped between the musings of the mind What's the point of anything!? and the lusts and longings of the body Why won't she love me!?.Divorced from his wife and desperate to hook up with another woman Allen spends the film bouncing from one bungled romantic date to the next until he realises that he's in love with a character played by Diane Keaton wife of his best friend. Much of the film references Humphrey Bogart's Casablanca Allen's meek and dysfunctional brand of masculinity compared with Bogey's suave debonair demeanour. Poor Allen just wants to be a hero like his on screen idol a chance which the film sets up in its Casablanca inspired climax only to swiftly undermine. He'll always be a loser. But this reassures us as the all pervasive sense of failure Woody brings to almost everything he does makes even the smallest victory and every morsel of hope both a triumph and inspiration.The film was seen as being fresh and unbridled in the early 70s loosening up and destroying what many had previously thought of as romantic comedies. The tone is breezy the style somewhat experimental as most of Allen's films are and the script wild and devilmaycare though filled with wit and observation. Much of the humour is improvised and on several occasions Ross' camera catches the unscripted crackingup of characters as they laugh at Woody's unexpected improvised antics.Yes today Sam's overall plot may be regarded as formulaic Allen's brand of humour having long found its way into countless movies and TV sitcoms but the jokes still hold up. Virtually every minute is packed with humour wit clever one liners and both smart and silly jokes. Like most of Allen's films during this period he essentially mingles old school farce and physical comedy with high brow humour silliness CamusSartre inspired existentialism and Kierkegaardian Absurdism.This sweet spot in Woody's career would end with Interiors when he began drifting away from his standup roots and began doing rifts on arthouse directors. In this regard his Interiors becomes a rift on Bergman's Cries and Whispers his Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy becomes a farcical version of Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night whilst Wild Strawberries becomes Allen's Another Woman. Meanwhile Fellini's 8 12 becomes Stardust Memories Amarcord becomes Radio Days and Fellini's section in Boccaccio 70 becomes Allen's short in New York Stories.Most of Allen's scripts have some clever experimental metaconstruction. Here every character is an observer looking in on Allen and sharing their observations. Allen himself plays himself looking and commenting on himself as Allan Fellix.All the film's female characters are airheads except Keaton who plays a neurotic woman with a low self esteem ie easy prey for the equally maladjusted Allen.8.910  Worth two viewings.".

	schema:headline " First AllenKeaton Pairing Retains Its Laughs and Shows Signs of Great Things to Come";
	schema:reviewBody "I have a special fondness for this lightweight 1972 romantic comedy from the pen of Woody Allen. Directed not by Allen but by Herbert Ross it represents the noteworthy first pairing of Allen and Diane Keaton and the combination of their unerring chemistry and Allen's clever often hilarious script makes for great viewing after all these years. Allen plays his usual nebbish character this time a film critic named Allan Felix whose freespirit wife leaves him for being a boring observer of life. He seeks solace from best friends Dick and Linda Christie he a workaholic stockbroker and she a model. They set him up on a series of hysterically bad blind dates which Allen plays out with physical abandon. Whether inadvertently flinging an album across the room or swinging spastically at a discotheque he is a master of slapstick a gift he has too rarely displayed since. Eventually the inevitable happens when Linda and Allan fall in love.What makes the predictable premise unique is the way Allen celebrates classic movies mainly Warner Brothers melodramas and has the characters reenact famous scenes to move the story along. He even the spirit of Humphrey Bogart act as his adviser when he faces romantic complications since Bogie always knew how to treat his women. It's all deftly acted by an expert cast. Beyond Allen Keaton shows the first signs of her unmatched comic prowess as Linda though for the most part she is called upon to be the conflicted leading lady. Tony Roberts another Allen favorite especially as the best friend plays Dick in his typically sharp manner. Jerry Lacy does a reasonable impersonation of Bogie and the long missing Susan Anspach plays Allen's wife with spacey vitriol.While the film obviously lacks the emotional depth and improvisational style of Allen's later films the obvious comparison being 1977's Annie Hall starring the same three leads it still has a quaint charm to go with its romantic comedy conventionality. Its riskaverse nature is what makes this film an invaluable addition to the Allen filmography as it shows how far he has come as a film auteur. Credit should also be given to Ross for bringing Allen's pictureperfect screenplay to life and also to cinematographer Owen Roizman for capturing the picturesque San Francisco locations while evoking classic Hollywood in key scenes. The DVD has no extras.".

While I like the extreme silliness of these earlier starring films I also see this as a welcome change and his most personally engaging filmit really has a lot of heart.Woody plays a nerdy guy what else? who is obsessed with Humphrey Bogart films. He loves them so much that Bogie himself often stops by to give him advice! These moments are wonderful and the actor imitating Bogart is spot on! Well for some odd reason his wife doesn't like Woody and leaves gee he sounds like the perfect guy huh?. His married friends Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts come to give him support and try to set him up with various ladies none of which comes even close to working out. However over time it becomes obvious to everyone except Woody and Diane that THEY would make a great couple. Even Bogie comes to tell Woody to make the moves on his friend's wife! Well here is where the plot begins to look more and more like CASABLANCAa natural considering Bogie's in this film too! Well I'll stop my review here because I DON'T want to spoil the picture. It's cute coherent and well worth seeing.PSa great scene involves Bogie having a showdown with Woody's exwife. It's a riot though in general this movie has more subtlety and less laugh out loud laughs than his previous films but it all works together so well it's not a problem.".

Play it Again Sam changed my mind! This is a lighthearted comedy that I found to be his greatest film. Woody Allen plays the same character he always plays in his movies but I actually found him to be quite funny in this one. The whole idea of Humphrey Bogart teaching him how to get women was just hysterical to me also. Jerry Lacy was a wonderful Bogart and the onscreen chemistry between Keaton and Allen was as wonderful as in Annie Hall. Overall Play it Again Sam was a wonderful quirky comedy but defiantly contains Woody Allen humor.I highly recommend this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie shortly after watching Annie Hall and I enjoyed it a bit more than the more celebrated later movie. Maybe that says more about my taste than the quality of the respective movies! Some of the comedy in Play it Again Sam is a lot broader than Allen's later movies but he also deals with the themes of relationship difficulties and infidelity that became a staple of his work later in the 70's and in the 80's.Allen does not direct the movie though it is based on a stage play of his. The story is about three close friends. A married couple played by Tony Roberts and Diane Keaton and their recently divorced friend played by Allen. Roberts' character is always busy with work and the other two spend a lot of time together and gradually realise that they have feelings for each other. The twist is that Allen's character a film buff occasionally gets relationship advice when Humphrey Bogart appears to him.There are plenty of really funny scenes such as when Allen finally tells Keaton how he feels about her. The ending is also very satisfying. As usual some of Allen's writing is brilliant.A must for anyone who wants to see Allen's best work.".

Woody wrote this brilliant comedy based on his own stage play and starred as Allan Felix a neurotic of course film critic that after being dumped by his wife is constantly visited by the ghost of his idol Humphrey Bogart Jerry Lacy. Bogart's ghost characterized as Rick Blaine from Casablanca gives Allan advice about how to win over beautiful women but our hero seems too clumsy to find the right lady. The only woman who seems to be ideal for Allan is Linda Christie Diane Keaton a close friend and also the wife of Allan's best friend Dick Tony Roberts.I think Play It Again Sam is easily one of the best comedies ever made almost in the same level as the classic Annie Hall. It's so good that I'm looking forward to seeing it again. If you don't laugh watching this you're very ill. 10 out of 10.".

Little Sam grew up to be a cop like his adoptive father and now as an adult Quinn he looks to follow in his father's footsteps on the L.A.P.D. But an evil unhinged brain surgeon aren't they all? named Karl Glock Lynch is using unsuspecting normal citizens and using them for his sick twisted experiments. He makes them believe all cops are supernatural grotesque monsters so when they see them they snap and start killing them. Now trying to figure out and combat an amorphous confusing threat before more boys in blue get killed Staziak must tap into his scanner abilities which have caused him nothing but pain in the process. But too much scanning can lead to insanity and sensory overload. Dr. Joan Alden Fluegel is helping but truly only Sam can come to terms with who he is and stop Glock in the process. Will he do it before it's too late for the L.A.P.D.  and himself? Find out today! Much like we said in our Scanner Cop II 1995 review not being scifi fans we weren't going in expecting much. But there is more to Scanner Cop than you might think and there are plenty of interesting ideas at work here that raise the level of enjoyment considerably. You can tell the writers actually thought about the plot a lot which goes a long way and is much appreciated. The intelligence and serious downbeat tone would surely do Cronenberg proud. Just the idea of a scanner cop is rife with possibilities and the movie thankfully capitalizes on them. We couldn't help but wonder why movies about other scanner professions never materialized scanner firefighter scanner teacher scanner professional boogieboarder  the options are endless.After a long career as a writer and producer this was director David's directorial debut. He'd worked with fellow Canadian Jeff Wincott a lot as he was a writer on Mission of Justice 1992 and Martial Law II 1992 and produced Marked Man 1996. David clearly learned a lot during his time doing other roles on film sets because it has a professional look and you'd never know it was his debut. While the humorless somewhat bleak approach he took was a good one this time around to sell the bizarre subject matter some levity would have helped and as David did not return as director for part II seemingly a little more fun was had the second time around.The cast is plentiful with Bmovie stars fan favorite Richard Lynch does his classic baddie thing Brion James is in it for about 2 seconds Hilary Shepard of Peacemaker 1990 fame plays Lynch's assistant named Zena predating Xena by a few years Cyndi Pass of Mission of Justice is here too and Billy Sly Williams plays a drug dealer named Eightball among other names in the cast. While Richard Grove did a fine job as Harrigan we can't help but think Stacy Keach would have been a nice cast addition in that role. He even played a similar part in Irresistible Force 1993. But maybe that's why he didn't do it.The Scanner Cop series was big on cable and in video stores at the time and while that doesn't seem that long ago to us clearly it is because in the movie characters smoke cigarettes indoors and in government buildings. Which tells us intelligent wellthoughtout scifi or any types of movies for that matter are getting farther and farther away in the past. Just compare this to the syfy channel's original movies. The difference is crystal clear. As with its sequel Scanner Cop is far better than you might think.".

Little Sam grew up to be a cop like his adoptive father and now as an adult Quinn he looks to follow in his father's footsteps on the L.A.P.D. But an evil unhinged brain surgeon aren't they all? named Karl Glock Lynch is using unsuspecting normal citizens and using them for his sick twisted experiments. He makes them believe all cops are supernatural grotesque monsters so when they see them they snap and start killing them. Now trying to figure out and combat an amorphous confusing threat before more boys in blue get killed Staziak must tap into his scanner abilities which have caused him nothing but pain in the process. But too much scanning can lead to insanity and sensory overload. Dr. Joan Alden Fluegel is helping but truly only Sam can come to terms with who he is and stop Glock in the process.

	schema:reviewBody "This surprisingly enjoyable Bmovie is a cut above most efforts from the early 1990s thanks to a plot which takes the series in a new interesting direction plenty of gore and violence and some decent acting. It's a movie with no pretensions which really packs in the groceries when it comes to gory action  I've never seen so many policemen get violently murdered in a single film! You know exactly what you're going to get with a film like this and it doesn't disappoint.The opening is admittedly cheesy with a scene where a hallucinating man sees lots of little screaming faces appear in his forehead nice effects but there's something just too rubbery about it. After this arresting sight things slow down in pace as we are introduced to the film's main hero played by Daniel Quinn. Quinn is very charismatic in his role of the cop torn between wanting a normal life and using his special powers as a method to fight crime. In fact I really liked his performance and most of the performances in this film  some like Richard Lynch's are deliberately over the top yet still highly amusing. Hilary Shepard is an alluring femme fatale while Richard Grove provides solid support. Only the introduction of Darlanne Fluegel as an unnecessary love interest rings false  her character is completely worthless to this film's development.The film focuses on a series of violent murders committed by members of the public who have been programmed to kill officers on sight. The unwilling murderers hallucinate that their worst fears are in front of them bugs gang members etc. leading them to attack with extreme violence. Of course this is just an excuse for the special effects guys to show as many different monstrous beasties as possible. All of the classic 'scanning' action is saved for the film's finale where the grue really flies.One clever scene has our cop hero scanning a dead woman  and following her soul down into hell. This scene is actually pretty highbrow for a simple film like this. There's a grand total of one exploding head which is nice and meaty and lots of disturbing imagery of asylum patients abusing themselves. The buildup to the ending is rushed and full of plot holes including one of those staple moments from the Bond films and many others where the chief villain traps the hero and leaves them to a fate worse than death only for the hero to escape in the nick of time. However the final hospital battle is an intense one with full of gooey bits and even some brief effective stopmotion thrown into the brew. It finishes with the baddie's metal headplate blasting from his skull in a spectacular fashion. SCANNER COP may not be an epic but it sure is a lot of fun.".

The script by John Bryant  George Saunders takes itself very seriously moves along at a nice pace  is as much a thriller as it is horror. It's a surprisingly decent film with good character's some nice scenes  overall the whole concept bizarrely works rather well. Samuel isn't presented as some sort of superhero  the film manages a nice balance between someone vulnerable with problems  someone with a unique gift which makes him powerful  frightening. On a disappointing note I didn't think there were enough exploding body parts I mean the fabulous exploding head is the scene everyone remembers from the original  the other two previous sequels as well I suppose but the original in particular  it's equivalent here is very weak by comparison  seems to be there for the sake of it blink  you'll miss it! I also didn't like the eventual reasoning behind the cop killings just one single person out for revenge against one cop just felt far too small in scope  throughly routine.Director David does a fine job Scanner Cop isn't going to win any awards for artistic merit or anything like that but it's competently made throughout. He keeps the story quite tight  he keeps it moving along. The special makeup effects are not too bad but sort of average as we get some bulging veins a few creatures  a scene where little faces pop out of someones forehead. The obligatory exploding head is less than spectacular  overall the gore level isn't that high.Technically Scanner Cop is OK  it's generally well made. The acting was alright although Quinn looks a little nervous at times. There are a couple of familiar genre faces here even though he is listed quite high in the opening credits Brion James appears for less than one minute Aliens 1986 actor Mark Rolston is here veteran Richard Lynch plays the villain  Hilary Shepard as his sidekick.Scanner Cop isn't a half bad film it's certainly better than a lot of low budget horrorthriller's that clutter video shop shelves. I think it's well worth a watch if this is your type of film  I personally prefer it to Cronenberg's dull as dishwater original. A sequel Scanner Cop II 1995 was made the following year.".

After his meeting with the police Alex decides to speak with Vivienne's mother. Upon arrival at her home Alex discovers that the mother Linda is a highly functional autistic woman who convinces him to stay long to take out the garbage the day after the funeral he agrees to arrange.

There was no point at which I doubted the authenticity of the character's experiences.

I can't really tell you more without giving it all away  go and see it! Snow Cake is both poignant and ribachingly funny in parts.We were also fortunate to meet the writer the director and the autistic woman who coached Sigourney Weaver. Absolutely fascinating.

	schema:headline " A film that makes you look at things in a brand new way  in a word dazlious!";
	schema:reviewBody "Snow Flake is a tale of insulated lives thrown into contact of insights that that are almost but not quite incommunicable of the power of unusual friendships of people defying what is expected of them and sometimes of what they would expect of themselves and of finding a strength in themselves and others as a result. And if that sounds clichd you have to go and see it to believe it.Sigourney Weaver is from a different world one not unlike our own. She's not battling Aliens or living in a sectarian timeshift Village but the world into which she brings us is as weird and dazzling enough for my jaw to drop after watching her for just a few minutes. Her presence jumps off the screen with such vividness that even though I had read the storyline I knew it was going to surpass my expectations. Her character is fascinated by things that sparkle can juggle numbers with unnerving rapidity inhabits a universe of extreme precision that brooks no infraction and no uncleanliness and she's only barely tolerant of your world. This is the world of Linda Freeman highfunctioning autistic.There are two sides to Linda the world she lives in is undoubtedly extraordinary  her version of Scrabble leaves Alan Rickman's character Alex Hughes looking severely unevolved  but it is balanced by her lack of empathy for 'normal' people. What makes Weaver's performance so remarkable is that she conveys the logical certitude of Linda's position with such force that we like Alex start feeling a bit dumb. Why do we go through such irrelevant teaandhamsandwiches rituals after a death? Why can't we feel the joy we felt as children when we discovered snow in our hands or the thrill of a trampoline as our body is launched into space? Why do we struggle to remember simple facts? The drawbacks of Linda's world apart from most people not being able to reach it is that she cannot cope with the imperfections that the rest of us would shrug off. If the dog leaves a stain on her carpet she will have simply have to 'move house' and the only kind of job she can get is one where her obsessive need for order can find a simplistic outlet she stacks shelves in a supermarket with mathematical precision and attention. If Rain Man was the goldmedallist of autism Linda Freeman is simply a nonglamorised regular sportswoman and in that she conveys a more real person than any Hollywoodised supercharacter.Alex Alan Rickman opens the film flicking poignantly at a small photo as he sits out a long flight. We have no clue as to who the person in the picture is or why he seems to be encased in his own intense thoughts. Later we see him in a transport caf approached by a bubbly young girl who is determined to break down his wall of silence. She wants to write a book and make loads of money  by finding the right areas of pain and suffering to focus on. Her apparent insensitivity is quickly tempered when she admits she admits she needs a lift but has picked the loneliest looking person because she really thinks he needs to talk. Alex reluctantly gives her a lift. She is soon singing the 70's rock song All Right Now at the top of her voice but things are far from all right. One car crash and an added truckload of emotional baggage later Alex is arriving on Linda's doorstep and destined to be her guest for more than a few hours. Our storyline is further complicated by the seductively attractive Maggie CarrieAnn Moss who has her eye on Alex. He first assumes she is a prostitute she reminded me of the classy callgirl Inara from Serenity but accepts a 'neighbourly' invitation for dinner.Rickman is at his best. The wry tongueincheek humour seen in many of his films gives way to a sardonic realism that is even funnier because it is more true to real life. A very down to earth script ensures the laughs are grounded Love Actually but without the unbelievability even if in most cases Rickman is principally a foil for other characters such as when Linda likens eating snow to an orgasm or Maggie breaks off dinner because she hates having sex on a full stomach.We soon realise that Linda's childlike behaviour thinly disguises a penetrating intelligence but her intelligence doesn't enable her to solve everyday problems such as putting the rubbish out. She has emotional insight even consideration but her world is as isolated from ours as ours is from hers even with her ability to reel off facts and figures. One is reminded of a recent study that suggested that emotional intelligence may serve people better in the workplace than a Mensa certificate.Rickman's character struggles with Canadian distances in a typically British manner. It didn't look far on the map he exclaims hopelessly. He is out of his depth geographically and emotionally but obsessed with his own inadequacies is open to seeing things differently. The landscape whiteness at first cold and unwelcoming starts to seem beautiful. Maggie allows Alex to open emotionally whereas Linda through the intellectual effort he makes to reach her enables him to rationalise the process and come to terms with his feelings. Linda is a doorway to seeing things differently  I'm half outside half inside she says as she hovers on the porch and we puzzle whether she is being dippy or intentionally defusing a difficult situation. The mathematical way she describes needing a hug reassures us that she is human but by then we have learnt a whole new attitude of respect. Snow Cake is a very personal film not a blockbuster but a few more films like this could enrich the way we see ourselves.".

'Snow Cake' much to my surprise and delight turned out to be an exhilarating sexy poignant movie that was full of love redemption and healing. And no don't worry the sex wasn't with the autistic character! I had heard about this movie the other day on BBC Radio 4 when Sigourney Weaver was interviewed on 'Women's Hour' I think it was. Whatever the radio show even that interview made it sound a bit 'well meaning' and earnest. And that makes for one dullass movie! Therefore while the interview raised my desire from zero to maybe 35 percent I still was hesitant to go and see it.I wish I had proper words to describe what a masterpiece this is. And it was a masterpiece perhaps because it was NOT obviously 'arty' or 'important'. It was about people. Real people. Wounded people. Alan Rickman delivered what is perhaps the best role of his career. Sigourney Weaver's performance as the lady with autism was so seamless that if I didn't know better I'd think she WAS autistic. And the young woman who played the daughter Emily Hamspshire I think her name is she was a refreshing dose of realism. We should watch for her as a rising new star. And CarrieAnne Moss was fantastic as the sex interest.This movie is simple and straightforward. Yet nothing was predictable either. I just loved it. This is exactly the kind of movie treasure that movie lovers usually can only dream of finding. And to think I only saw it 'accidentally' because I had already seen everything else at the cinema.I am SO glad I went! The movie I promise is NOT about autism or how we treat sufferers or any other boring PC diatribe. It is about ME. And YOU. It's about all of us and our hearts and the inspiration and healing and good luck that we all yearn for and we all deserve. Now after this movie the picture of what is possible is bigger clearer and stronger for me. Now THAT is a gift to me! Thank you cast and makers of 'Snow Cake'!".

I was worried that she won't like it. But my worries were gone as the film flows I smiled I laugh and even got tears in my eyes. I left the screening with a smile on my face and a warm and cosy feeling at heart. Even me friend loved it. This movie has depth yet makes you laugh and smile. And Now I am dying to watch it again.Alan Rickman is wonderful as usual his talent deserves an Oscar nod someday. Signourey Weaver is pretty good though some of you said that her portrayal of autistic people is inaccurate I am not sure. Carrie Anne Moss is cool but well I guess it is hard for her to outshine Alan and Signourey . I love the script the lines are funny and thought provoking at the same time. It makes you think AND laugh.All in all impressive and beautiful.".

Alan Rickman was of course his amazing self. his presence on the screen always pleases me no matter what he is in. this film however was again different from any other. unlike the usual Rickman character of which you can expect sarcasm such as in love actually or close my eyes and a deviousness such as harry potter or robin hood  or even a warm loving character such as colonel Brandon.this time we are presented with an all round character in which Mr Rickman's talents shine unbelievably and i believe that you can see a contentedness in his acting. the character is lovable curious devious hilarious sentimental and of course understandable. his actions are understood by all. the scenery in the film was amazing and the music sublime. the atmosphere was just perfect for a film with such hard hitting lessons. the meaningful statements from the deceased Vivianne and the innocent and wise statements from Linda are truly memorable and made me think. instead of leaving the cinema with an over powering sense of wow and over the top excitement usually collected from a Hollywood motion picture such as in a false star wars or lord of the rings i left with a sense of questioning and self analysis. i felt comfortable to stay silent in thought and express little of my emotions. i did not feel the need to over emphasise its greatness until i had thought about it thoroughy.anyone who reads this. please please please please go see snow cake if it is on near you as this amazing movie needs and deserves complete recognition form all of us fellow film viewers. totally amazing!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Snowcake is a slightly offbeat movie in the same vein as Sideways and Broken flower offering a good mix of humour and poignancy as well as thoughtful insight into human nature. It leans towards being out of the ordinary but does not go overboard to be bizarre. It takes place in Wawa Ontario a small town population of several thousand that reflects the rugged beauty of North of Superior see IMDb listing. Prominently featured in several scenes is the 28foot tall sculpture Canada Goose that marks the entrance to the town. I have not been to Wawa but had once come within a hundred miles from the Sault St. Marie side.One of the three main protagonists is an outsider Alex Hughes Alan Rickman who picks up a hitchhiker teenager Vivienne Freeman Emily Hampshire on her way home to Wawa. Aspiring to be a writer she approaches Alex with the belief that since he looks so lonely he must have a good story of his life to tell. Tragically Vivienne never gets home as their car gets into an accident which leaves Alex unscathed but kills her. The rest of the story happens in the ensuing week in Wawa where Alex tries to help Vivienne's autistic mother Linda Sigourney Weaver arrange the funeral. Through interaction with Linda and other inhabitants of this town Alex finds absolution from a guilt that has been weighting heavily on him. The number one key character of Snowcake however is unquestionably Linda.Rather than getting into all the details that should be left for the viewers to enjoy I would just mention some of the interesting aspects of this movie. The biggest challenge is to make Linda believable. An average moviegoer is not expected to have much experience with an autistic person. The closest impression one gets is probably the Rain man version. If Dustin Hoffman was good enough with his performance to win an Oscar Weaver certainly is also for Snowcake. At her first appearance at her doorstep answering Alex's knock Linda does not appear to have been grieved acknowledging almost in a matteroffact manner that she heard about the death of her daughter two hours ago. It isn't until towards the end of the movie after we have spent a considerable amount of time with Linda that we begin to understand that perhaps she can retain in a corner of her mind a much more solid picture of her lost daughter than a normal person can. This becomes clear in the dancing scene at the postfuneral gathering at Linda's place. In a sense she has not really lost Vivienne.Linda doesn't do socials as she explains to Alex right at the beginning. At times she seems closed to everything around her but she is not entirely unreachable. At times especially on important things she is more sensible than normal people such as in the way she deals with her daughter's death. At other times she is irritating or even exasperating but endearingly so. Sounds absurd but just watch Weaver make this character believable  it's a Sigourney Weaver you've never seen before.Also never seen before is CarrieAnne Moss playing warm hearted neighbour Maggie with sensuousness in such a mellowed sort of way that will make you gasp. All of a sudden you realise that watching too much Alien and Matrix has blurred your perception to what these two wonderful actresses are capable of. I am not too surprised that so many people go to see Snowcake just because of Rickman. They will of course be delighted to get a lot more than Rickman but he alone is a good enough reason. Although not quite to the extent of Murray's minimalism in Broken Flowers Rickman plays a remorseful man with subdued hesitancy. It's when Alex interacts with Linda that they both come to life. In addition to those three there is an excellent supporting cast particularly Emily Hampshire.One final word somewhere in the middle of the movie there is one moment when the audience of the show I attended broke out in spontaneous thunderous applause. You should have no problem recognizing it  Rickman was speaking  and you'll probably get the same reaction in your show anyway.I am not sure when Snowcake will be screened commercially or go to the film festival in your city. But when it does don't miss it.".

The principal characters were as diverse as they were interesting and the audience immediately cared what happened to them  always a sign of a good film. Alan Rickman was just perfect as Alex  the role needed someone who could carry the weight of his past while dealing with this latest hand thrown to him by fate. I loved the way he came to care for Linda by the end of the film. I think that this is definitely one of Mr Rickman's best roles since AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURESigourney Weaver was amazing  she played her part in such a way that her Autism bothered everyone else a lot more than it did her. Is this a common feature of Autism  I am sorry to say that I have no idea. The fact that she is unable to outwardly show her grief for her daughter serves to underline how vulnerable she is and this coupled with her childlike enjoyment of life warms the heart of the audience.The setting too is magnificent. Especially the setting sun scene at the lake.I would urge anyone who likes something as different as it could be from the Hollywood blockbuster to go and see this classy film.".

I think that this is definitely one of Mr Rickman's best roles since AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURESigourney Weaver was amazing  she played her part in such a way that her Autism bothered everyone else a lot more than it did her. Is this a common feature of Autism  I am sorry to say that I have no idea. The fact that she is unable to outwardly show her grief for her daughter serves to underline how vulnerable she is and this coupled with her childlike enjoyment of life warms the heart of the audience.The setting too is magnificent. Especially the setting sun scene at the lake.I would urge anyone who likes something as different as it could be from the Hollywood blockbuster to go and see this classy film.";

The performances of the actors of Rickman in particular are outstanding and the characters are showed with intimacy and delicate attention to details. The close ups face Carrie Anne Moss a kind of unrealistic femme fatale in the middle of nowhere gently whispering in dim light are worth the ticket. But i didn't completely buy the script. Shouldn't it be more difficult for Alex to get into Linda's house? Shouldn't a man which such a traumatic past behave like an eighteenth century English gentleman? Morever as far as I know about psychiatry Linda is a mixture of mental disease stereotypes more than an actual autistic.

Shot in Canada and pretty much released directtovideo Snow Cake is one of those odd characterdriven films like Transamerica and Broken Flowers that entrusts a decidedly nonmainstream screenplay to an offtheradar director and a coterie of accomplished actors with remarkably satisfying results.I love discovering films like Snow Cake and am thankful that talents like Weaver Rickman and Moss are willing to tackle them. I love enjoying the work of journeymen like cinematographer Steve Durham County Cosens who fruitfully labor outside the limelight of celebrity and deliver results that match or exceed those of their more famous counterparts. Most of all I enjoy experiencing the fruition of efforts by talented unknowns like Ms. Pell.This is not to say that Snow Cake has no faults script or otherwise. At times the fadesedits clearly indicate a narrative structure adaptable to commercial television presentation. The score by Broken Social Scene is often overtly manipulative if not downright cloying. Some of the premises of the film seem a bit forced cf. the RickmanMoss romance. Nonetheless Snow Cake has far more to recommend it than not. The three leads are at the top of their game disregard any comments you see that claim Ms. Weaver is acting rather than being the storyline is engagingly peppered with quality dialog that actually has something to say and I'm hard pressed to recall a film in which the significance of the title is revealed so late in the plot and yet carries such resonance throughout.There's nothing here for action fans to see move along please. Snow Cake is a lovingly realized character piece wellcrafted despite whatever weaknesses it may have and easily worth the several hours spent with it by openminded viewers. The DVD features include deleted scenes most for obvious reasons and trailer. Recommended to all who enjoy lifeaffirming tales that refuse to condescend.".

	schema:headline " There will be no feeling cold after this film a rare gem.";
	schema:reviewBody "Here is a film that sets an example in the field of attention to detail. This film has probably had its concept born its idea written down the idea then transformed into a screenplay and then that screenplay has been rewritten a couple of times to include every single tiny meaning and attention to detail possible some the audiences will notice and some who will not as they're either too quick or they're just caught up in the brilliance that is the rest of the film.When I say attention to detail I mean the indepth study of characters. I was asking several questions as to why certain characters were acting the way they were towards others and just when I thought there's something the film has done wrong it went back and answered my question twenty minutes later. Without giving anything away I couldn't work out why Alex Rickman was so antagonistic towards the truck driver but the film answers the question near the end when Alex's past tragedy becomes clear also the attention to the characters in particular was outstanding. Vivienne Hampshire has the interesting quirk of putting her McDonalds fries in her burger and then eating it Linda Weaver is able to identify that Alex is wearing her 'third favourite sweater' and all throughout the film sounds and noises in the background of dogs barking birds chirping and distant traffic puts us there.I got the feeling that before every take whilst shooting the filmmakers thought of everything they possibly could to either hint at past and unseen events or just ask themselves 'this situation has arisen  what would happen' and this is where the script being rewritten and thought through on such an impressive level comes in that it's hard to think of another recent film that is as impressive as this. I loved the way the film actually restarts after about fifteen minutes following an action that even I was surprised by I loved the way that during Alex and Vivienne's journey we are given time out to see side shots of massive trucks suddenly blur by emphasising the seemingly random and unnecessary. It seems ironic that the film has that certain 'snowy' look to it and the exterior shots that feel like absolute white allows you to actually 'see' the cold rather than feel it since if we're watching a film in a warm room we can't feel what the characters are feeling.Another strong point is the cast. Having Alan Rickman Sigourney Weaver and CarrieAnn Moss away from trying to either blow up John McLane fight off Aliens or box a bunch of Agent Smiths is a real treat and you quickly forget who's who  these are really recognisable faces in a film you don't expect them to be in and for me to forget who they are and just accept them as characters is really impressive. The film uses an impressive array of techniques to get across its effectiveness  the first proper interaction between Alex and Maggie Moss is in a room full of red signalling danger  there are red curtains red candles they're even drinking red wine and what with Linda already labelling her a prostitute we are suddenly weary. I especially liked the way that Alex and Maggie's lakeside conversation was intercut with shots of melting ice coming apart as Alex himself describes how his life melted away and came apart when he suffered his past tragedy  again attention to detail is the key here as a seemingly straight forward conversation has been thought through with shots of melting ice.Snow Cake is the sort of film you watch and allow yourself to get wrapped up in. It is an emotional journey with powerful acting and many many effective scenes  effective because they're well shot and thought through but effective because they make you feel during the film. Really well written really well directed and really well acted by Weaver and Rickman as the two leads  memorable film.".

Having Alan Rickman Sigourney Weaver and CarrieAnn Moss away from trying to either blow up John McLane fight off Aliens or box a bunch of Agent Smiths is a real treat and you quickly forget who's who  these are really recognisable faces in a film you don't expect them to be in and for me to forget who they are and just accept them as characters is really impressive. The film uses an impressive array of techniques to get across its effectiveness  the first proper interaction between Alex and Maggie Moss is in a room full of red signalling danger  there are red curtains red candles they're even drinking red wine and what with Linda already labelling her a prostitute we are suddenly weary. I especially liked the way that Alex and Maggie's lakeside conversation was intercut with shots of melting ice coming apart as Alex himself describes how his life melted away and came apart when he suffered his past tragedy  again attention to detail is the key here as a seemingly straight forward conversation has been thought through with shots of melting ice.Snow Cake is the sort of film you watch and allow yourself to get wrapped up in. It is an emotional journey with powerful acting and many many effective scenes  effective because they're well shot and thought through but effective because they make you feel during the film. Really well written really well directed and really well acted by Weaver and Rickman as the two leads  memorable film.";

Many people will compare Sigourney Weaver's performance with Dustin Hoffman's in Rainman which is unfair because the characters do not share the same handicap at all. I have not been around a lot of autistic individuals. In fact the only autistic person that I ever met was my best friends niece whom I saw a lot growing up. She was probably more highly functioning than the Siguorney Weaver character but Ms. Weaver's acting was Oscar caliber. I would be blown away if she gets an Oscar nod and although I have not yet seen the Queen Helen Mirren probably has a lock this year but I hope this performance is seen and remembered at awards time.Alan Rickman plays a tortured soul like no other actor and gives a moving performance. Carrie Ann Moss wears no makeup and comes off ten times sexier than she does in Matrix leather and that is sexy.At some point this film will be compared to The Curious Incident of the Dog at in the nighttime which is supposed to be filmed by Steven Kloves and should pose a great challenge to translate from book to screen. And what a wonderful book that was as well. I probably liked that book even better than this film but I will be greatly surprised if the Kloves film captures what this film managed to do. Angela Pells has written a moving script. At times hilarious frequently touching and one of the best little films that I have ever seen. Don't miss it.".

	schema:headline " Weaver is great as a fully functioning adult autistic woman despite other characters with standard 'hearts of gold'";
	schema:reviewBody "Snow Cake is a Canadian film which had many more favorable reviews than negative ones. I believe there is little argument that it was Sigourney Weaver's performance that drew people to the film resulting in all the accolades. And I would agree that the single most compelling aspect of the film is the multilayered character that Weaver plays 'Linda' a fully functioning adult autistic woman. Linda seemed pretty believable to me as Weaver captures both the childlike simplicity of the character as well as the torment. The screenwriter Angela Pell certainly knows something about autism since she raised an autistic son.What's fascinating about Linda is that her emotional life is so bifurcated. On one hand she's a simple child who is intimately connected to naturethe snow cake symbolizing the connection she feels to the earthperhaps her greatest joy is to experience the snow melting in her mouth. But on the other hand as an adult she's unable to let herself be intimate with anyone who seeks to get close to her. She creates boundaries such as not allowing anyone into her kitchen and like all those who suffer from severe obsessivecompulsive disorder resorts to maintaining order in the environment in order to avoid contact with those who attempt to form a relationship with her. Even when she allows someone to touch her when for example she asks Alex to 'hug' her she insists that he wrap his arms around her without using his hands. There is an additional aspect that makes Linda such a rich character her creativity. One of the most enjoyable moments in the film is when she plays scrabble with Alex using only madeup words.Vivienne Linda's daughter is also another fascinating character who we only meet briefly at the beginning of the film as she's soon killed in the accident. Rather than viewing Vivienne as having been damaged by the lack of a 'normal' mother figure she's actually a young woman who's learned to cope in the face of a difficult upbringing. What's more she's incorporated the positive creative aspects of her mother's personality that makes her so endearing. Another very powerful moment in the film is the father's eulogy of Vivienne in which he conveys the strength of her character and the enormous sense of loss as a result of her tragic death.Pell is less successful with the other characters in her film. Alex is also supposed to be 'damaged goods' as we eventually learn of his back story he killed the man responsible for the death of the son he was on his way to meet for the first time. It's obvious why Pell has the emotionally stunted Alex on his way to a first meeting and not having met the son before by depriving Alex of meeting the son he loses his mind and kills the victim a drunk driver in a fit of rage. I wanted to find out more about Alexinstead  he's pretty much depicted as a onenote character severely depressed due to his earlier loss of control as well as guilt over the death of Vivienne.Alex overcomes his depression by reaching out and helping Linda. But he also moves forward through his relationship with Maggie perhaps the least convincing character in the film. I just didn't get why Maggie would jump into bed so fast with Alex or why she's attracted to him at all. After all it's not like she hasn't had other men in her life. What's more she has no idea who this Alex character is. On the surface it's obvious he's depressed. Maggie is the artificial love interest that also serves as an impetus to repair Alex's damaged soul. Indie dramas are littered with these saintly characters with their perennial 'hearts of gold'!Aside from the saintly Maggie and Alex along with Linda's loving parents most of the rest of the townspeople come off as wholly unsympathetic as they feign tolerance and sympathy for Linda but behind her back secretly have contempt for her. In one of the deleted scenes on the DVD a woman comes up to Alex in a McDonald's and compliments Alex on the good job he's been doing with her Alex turns around and slyly tells the woman that Linda is his wife! I'm not sure why the scene was deleted but perhaps the director sensed that it was too didactic the 'moral' Alex must teach a lesson to one of the uncaring townspeople. The idea of a collective group of uncaring townspeople as the films' collective 'antagonist' doesn't work precisely people are much more complicated and nuanced as the film's scenarist suggests.This might seem odd but the thing that bothered me most about 'Snow Cake' is the screenwriter's failure to explain the nature of the accident. Why is everything left so vague when the truck driver piles into Alex and Vivienne? Wouldn't the circumstances of the accident have been broadcast on the nightly news? By leaving the nature of the accident vague this allows Alex to act with hostility toward the truck driver barring him from bringing the flowers to Linda. But had Alex knew what really happened he couldn't have used that as an excuse to be angry with the truck driver. The confrontation between the two seems forced and sets up the sentimental scene in the church where Alex 'forgives' the driver which he has no right to do since presumably the death of Vivienne was an accident!.As a psychological portrait of a fully functioning adult autistic woman and her quirky but vibrant teenage daughter Snow Cake hits the mark. But most of the rest of the Snow Cake characters particularly Maggie and Alex never rise above the level of caricature. For all its wellmeaning sensitivity Snow Cake is more a fairy tale than a story that could actually happen in real life.".

I had an extra twelve dollars on hand saw it on the shelf of the local Best Buy and thought Oh what the hell. I had been going on a recent Alan Rickman fling so I decided to annex this unknown film to my collection. To be honest what made me pick it up was the picture on the back cover of Alan being restrained by the police. It seemed rather intense. I bought it took it home and then around midnight I popped it into my laptop expecting something pretty good. I did not expect something truly spectacular.Lately I've been telling people that this is my alltime favorite movie and I haven't changed my alltime favorite movie since Silence of the Lambs came out. Let me tell you Snow Cake deserves the number one slot. It is undoubtedly the peak performance of both Alan's and Sigourney's careers and if they manage to pull off something even more impressive I will hale them as the greatest actors of our generation  though I have already bestowed this title upon Mr. Rickman. I have shown this movie to dozens of friends and each of them said the same thing of Alan's abilities in Snow Cake he acts as if he isn't acting at all. In every one his movies but in this one in particular he has this innate skill of making you believe he IS the person he plays. There is no falter in his performance no moment when you question him. His emphasis in empathy with the audience is truly stunning. Mr. Rickman's portrayal of a flawed Alex Hughes is utterly flawless in and of itself.From what I have read the most controversial aspect of Snow Cake is in Sigourney Weaver's performance. It seems to me that you either love her or you hate her. I most definitely fall into the former category having an autistic but highly verbal brother myself I very much appreciated the obvious research she put into her role. I have watched this movie with my mother and every time she displayed a new compulsion or tic we commented on how we had seen these exact same expressions from my brother. I'm very appreciative that Ms. Weaver studied her part so thoroughly whereas some actors would have not done nearly as meticulous a job of getting into the mind of an autistic person.I've watched Snow Cake five times even within the past three days and I have yet to tire of its breathtakingly moving performances beautiful artistic cinematography and heartwrenching storyline. I have never been so appreciative of such little aspects of movies as I am in Snow Cake such as tiny quirks of the eyebrow from Alan or the subtle inability to meet other's eyes from Sigourney. There isn't a single part of this film that I would alter and as a film fanatic this is quite the accomplishment. Go out and find this movie You will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not having seen this movie for over twenty years and stumbling across a video of it recently I said why not? The stars of this movie provided outstanding acting. Joe Regalbuto as the FBI agent in London of 1939 was a bit wooden in the part. However I try not to blame actors as they may have been directed to act the way they do. Also the part called for a naive and inexperienced federal agent. The thing that occurred to me is why would the US Government send an inexperienced agent all the way to London for such an important job and no senior partner to guide him? He wasn't a bad actor it was bad writing he just didn't seem to be into the part. Other than that the top actors and actresses did a fine job. Tom Sellick brought his usual suave good looks and easy manner to the part of the professional jewel thief. The local London police official Bob Hoskins  later of Roger Rabbit and other fame hated the thief. I don't think it was ever explained why he had such a virulent hatred. One thing is for sure though he was very believable and made a name for himself. Lauren Hutton was the twisted Nazi female so scary that I tipped my hat to Selleck during the movie for even getting close to her. But he had his job to do and never lost his confidence. Hutton played the part to the hilt. Her watch dog was played by Nazi Gestapo badman Warren Clarke and brother was he tough. Excellent job Mr. Clarke. Ed Lauter played Lassiter's friend the car thief and the man who taxied him around town. I've seen him many times and he is always a steady addition to any cast. In the top parts that brings us to Jane Seymour. She has played so many wonderful parts it is difficult to say which was best. But this much is true  she may very well be one of the most beautiful woman of our time. I mean truly beautiful. Sure she had a nude scene in this movie and what a lovely bottom. However I'm talking about her face with delicate features that slender down to the chin past sensual eyes nose and lips. Not quite perfect yet nearly so and all coming together into a delicate oval shape. Nevertheless she has handled demanding roles like Dr. Quinn the first Battlestar Galactica movie and Somewhere In Time to mention just a few. In this movie she was Selleck's lover and a local dancer. She took a part that might have been on the minor side for other actresses and turned it into a vehicle that increased her value. Lassiter has so many neat things that might be missed like the period costumes antique automobiles motorcycle dinning car in a train casino interior Nazi guns and guards a high wire escape probably by a stunt man and kudos to the two boxers Clive Curtis and George Lane Cooper who gave a real knockemdown performance. It is a movie made of the good stuff of old fashioned entertainment. It wasn't perfect but it had danger love sex gambling fist fights gun play boat explosion diamonds intrigue and treachery. Be sure to catch this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lassiter has all the ingredients of a great film a great caper good leads an interesting setting action and romance.  What it didn't have was a budget to do the production justice and an overabundance of tv actors.Lassiter is basically an attempt to cash in on Tom Selleck's fame on Magnum PI and his loss of the role of Indiana Jones.  The film is set in the same time period as Raiders of the Lost Ark with the same villains the Nazis. Instead of a swashbuckling archaeologist Selleck is a slick jewel thief Nick Lassiter.  Instead of being recruited by the government to recover a treasure he is blackmailed.  However this is no ode to the Republic serials no this is an ode to the caper films of yesterday with a little To Catch a Thief thrown in for good measure.Selleck's Nick Lassiter is an American jewel thief living and operating in London.  When not stealing from high society he enjoys the good life. Selleck looks good in his period costumes like he belongs.  He brings charm and humor to the role the perfect blend for a gentleman thief.Jane Seymour is his love interest a dancer.  Seymour is beautiful as always and makes the most of a limited role.Lauren Hutton gets the juicier role of the Nazi courier and kinky assassin. Hutton plays this decadent role to the hilt if a bit over the top.Finally Bob Hoskins is a London cop who concocts the frameup that forces Lassiter to attempt to steal Nazi diamonds.  This is one of Hoskins earlier film roles and he easily steals the movie.  He's not a likable character but he keeps your interest.The rest of the cast is filled primarily with tv actors like Joe Regalbuto and Ed Lauter.  They are fine actors but don't bring the same level to their character roles that the better film actors do.  Their appearance has more to do with budget than talent.The film was cofinanced by Raymond Chow of Golden Harvest which explains the low budget.  Had this been a bigger studio picture with stronger supporting characters it could have been a great hit.  Instead it is an entertaining minor film which appears to steal from James Bond and Indiana Jones.  It looks like it was made for tv and works better on the small screen.  The music is of the period and makes a welcome change from more modern music.  The end credits feature a song from Taco.  For those not acquainted with 80's New Wave Taco was an odd performer who mixed New Wave sounds with Cole Porter and other Jazz Age songs.  He had the perfect voice for those songs but the end result was more amusing than memorable.This is a fine film to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon or when sick in bed.  It brings a smile to your face as long as your expectations aren't too high.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Selleck best known for the 1980s cop TV show Magnum P.I. and of course for his signature mo. But in the middle of that series he starred in a classy oldfashion crime caper which sees him as jewel thief Nick Lassiter working in London in the 1930s but one day he's arrested by Scotland Yard and blackmailed into stealing a large quantity of diamonds that's kept in the heavily guarded Germany embassy and is looked after by Hitler's cruel but seductive secret agent Kari Von Fursten. What made the film for me were the performances. Selleck is fitting in the main role as Lassiter suave but dogged. Who really stood out though were the ladies Jane Seymour and especially Lauren Hutton. A hypnotic Seymour brought a sweet innocence to her role as Lassiter's dancer girlfriend while the very seductively edgy Hutton was the opposite in her kinky femme fatal part. In support there were solid character actors Joe Regalbuto Bob Hoskins Ed Lauter and a burly Warren Clarke as a German bodyguard. Watching how the breezy story unfolds is predictable although clever in its schemes and throwbacks but the engrossing script Whom playing whom character interactions and plannedout scenarios numerous instances of caught between a rock and a hard place are enjoyably digestible and humorously sharp. The direction is trim but fashionably tailored with good locations and period details. Catchy theme song during the end credits too.".

	schema:headline " Slick period caper film done in by dull lead";
	schema:reviewBody "Convincing period settings highlight this uneven film inspired by some of the caper films of the 1930s focusing on a suave cat burglar in London blackmailed into service for the Allies. He is tasked with trying to break into the imposing German Embassy and stealing some gems in an attempt to foil a Nazi plot.A fun concept somehow goes astray and never realizes its full potential. Director Roger Young and company take an oldfashioned plot dress it up in dandy clothes add some dashes of modern sex violence and nudity but their final effort falls apart long before the conclusion and at least in one case it is not hard to see why.A plot this simple should move with fleet feet but the pace instead moves in fits and starts. The bones of a great film are here but they are never fleshed out enough and some convoluted plot additions do not help. The film drags on long past the point it should have concluded and contains at least one too many conclusions.The production looks great and sports a fine supporting cast. Bob Hoskins is on hand as a sputtering British bobby who does not like giving the elusive Lassiter a getoutjailfree card for his efforts. Jane Seymour is as pretty as a porcelain doll as Lassiter's girl Friday. Lauren Hutton has a field day as the sexually voracious and deadly German courier whom Lassiter must romance in order to scope out the interior of the German Embassy. Unfortunately after presenting Hutton as a truly deadly nemesis the film completely bungles their final confrontation and fails to show us their love scene which one would imagine would have been wild indeed.The film's biggest problem lies with its leading man. Obviously the character of Lassiter conjures up the likes of a George Sanders David Niven or Cary Grant. In short it requires someone charismatic urbane debonair yet able to pull off the physical action required. After having bored us to death two years previously with a similar period adventure in High Road to China actor Tom Selleck now torpedoes another period piece. Where debonair is called upon Selleck gives us dull. Where suspense and action are called for Selleck gives us lifeless. He comes off as little more than a goodlooking prop who can barely summon the energy to move from point A to point B on the set. I would say he is wooden but I am afraid to libel a tree. He never seems much of a match for Hutton proves a dismally lacking romantic foil for Seymour and comes off as little better than a stunt man in the action scenes. We have no rooting interest nor concern in what happens with this character and that is largely the fault of Selleck's lackluster performance. By the film's conclusion quite literally the ONLY memorable thing that Selleck has contributed is in briefly baring his best asset while exiting Hutton's bed in the nude. This stellar contribution is offset moments later when a guard catches him lounging around in Hutton's frilly robe and a scene where the actor could have demonstrated a light comic touch is instead played as if a humorless mannequin inhabited the part.Rarely have I seen an actor whose lowwattage on screen personality so completely sabotages a film Rob Lowe's hohum performance in Masquerade comes to mind but that film was strong enough to overcome him as what Selleck does here. Hollywood was and is teaming with a lot of goodlooking leading men so why filmmakers would choose to fill such a role as this with an actor of arguably no charisma or life is a real headscratcher. In all honesty in some scenes Lassiter could have been portrayed by a chair and the end result would offer no difference than what Selleck contributes here.".

That's because Hoskins is just itching to nail him if something goes wrong. There are two prominent female parts Jane Seymour as the good girl and Lauren Hutton doing her best Marlene Dietrich imitation as full time Nazi seductress and a real man killer literally.Jewels is his game and a fortune in gems the Germans are known to keep in their embassy is what the British want. They say the sale of the swag will finance all kinds of subversion. Selleck might have alternate uses in mind.Playing a small but very key role is fellow expatriate Ed Lauter who used to be a bootlegger in the States along with Selleck but left for the United Kingdom where the cops don't carry guns and therefore not likely to shoot you. Lauter is a wheel man and that fact plus the fact that their police don't carry weapons is key to how Selleck pulls the caper off.Lassiter is a lighthearted caper film and a caper pulled against the most evil of villains is something always the audience will like.".

	schema:headline " Very good Freudinspired movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is an interesting psychological study of a young lady obsessed with the memory of her dead father. Freudiantypes would love it as it explores what is termed 'the Electra Complex'. According to the sexually obsessed Freud girls ALL go through a period in which they are in love with their fathers but they eventually work past this and grow to normal adulthood don't blame methis is FREUD'S theory not mine. This tale is about a girl who never works past this emotional milestone and is completely devoted to living in the past even though her father has been dead for a long time. This girl June Allyson has been depressed and trying to keep her dad's memory alive. Claudette Colbert is her stepmother and in a different way she too cannot let go of the memory of this dead man.The film begins with Colbert moving both her stepkids to their oceanfront home which they had not been to since the husband's suicide a decade earlier. One of Colbert's old flames Walter Pidgeon lives nearby and it immediately becomes apparent to the viewer that June Allyson is in love with Pidgeon. She sees him as a substitute fatherfigure and neither Pidgeon not Colbert notices this. In fact this is all very very creepy because he is twice June's age and she is symbolically dating her father! In addition to this weirdness Claudette NEVER told June the truth about her father's death. The man was NOT the 'saint' June envisions but an alcoholic thief! How this and the infatuation are resolved is what you'll need to see for yourself. I'd tell you more but it would really spoil the ending.An odd and wellacted psychological film worth your time but probably not to everyone's taste.".

I was thrilled to learn it was going to be shown on Turner Movie Classics the other night.I had correctly remembered the story including some dialog Dr. Rossiger Your daughter is in love with a ghost which means she's on the brink of disaster! and the central role of the music. The composer Bronislau Kaper skillfully used the Liszt Piano Concerto 1 throughout the film including during the climax scenes. I had actually studied and performed this piece with a symphony orchestra at the age of 19 how stunning to hear the orchestra's opening chords under the MGM lion followed by the piano's imposing solo entrance as the film's title appears. The Chopin Nocturne in Db my personal favorite is the romantic piece played in the film by both Penny and her father Kaper also used its theme creatively in his underscoring. I'm unable to identify the other more mournful piece that runs through the film.I remember being smitten with June Allyson when seeing this film as a child. The other night it was interesting to realize that 45 years ago I hadn't noticed the stunning Claudette Colbert!Thanks for sharing my reminiscences. Here's hoping that MGM might see fit to release The Secret Heart on DVD.".

June is a talented pianist but she's increasingly withdrawing from the world citing a heart condition that cardiologists can't find a reason for. When Claudette sees psychologist Lionel Barrymore she tells Barrymore about her marriage with their late father Richard Derr and the tragic circumstances and gossip that surrounded his death.The cure prescribes Dr. Barrymore is to be found at their New England coastal farm where Derr died and this might unlock Allyson's psychosis. Of course a whole lot of the family's dirty linen gets an airing before the film concludes.Walter Pidgeon has not all that much to do but be the tower of strength as the best friend of Derr and the man Colbert was really secretly in love with. The film is carried by the leading women of the cast Colbert and Allyson. The two play well off each other especially Allyson. This was quite a change from the usual goodygoody girl next door types she was always cast. I should also single out Richard Derr who in the few scenes he has suggested a brooding melancholy that you will remember throughout the film. His performance has to be good in order to understand why Allyson is the way she is.The Secret Heart is a nice psychological soap opera with Claudette Colbert standing in nicely for Greer Garson.".

It's a June Allyson seldom seen and a long way from her usual bubbly roles. Still she handles the disturbed daughter's antics in effective fashion. Those scenes at cliff's edge bordering an eternal sea are eerily enchanting and a tribute to the production crew. This was a period following the war when movies with strong Freudian themes were popular including Bewitched 1945 and The Snake Pit 1948. .The acting is firstrate and I especially like Sterling as the upbeat Chase who furnishes a counterpoint of normality to the moody family atmosphere. Pidgeon too is suavely effective though his Chris seems a little dense about Penny's obvious designs on him. The version I saw TMC didn't include the narration by Hume Cronyn listed in the credits. Perhaps it's just as well since the movie works well enough without a voiceover. The ending is about what you'd expect from this Code enforced period and is way too pat for what's gone before. Nonetheless it's an effective little exercise that manages a shade of difference from other programmers of the period.".

Going to see Penny Chase notices that even though she's very happy to see her big brother she still very effected by her and Chase's dad untimely death ten years ago. The movie turns to Chase and Penny's stepmother Lee Claudette Colbert who we see at psychiatrist Dr. Rossiger Lionel Barrymore office discussing Penny's psychosis. After a long flashback about what brought her into this depression it's recommended by Dr.Rossinger that Lee should take Penny and Chase back to their old and discarded country home in Uxbridge MA. It's there where the two were brought up and where Penny can confront her severe psychological problems head on or else her condition as she gets older will become hopeless.The root of Penny's psychosis has to do with her father Larry Addams Richard Derr whom she was closer to then anyone else and died when Penny was only seven years old. Larry a gifted pianist was forced to become a banker by his strict father and that lead to Larry becoming an alcoholic. Having invested his clients money in a number of highrisk stocks the market suddenly crashed causing his investments to be wiped out leaving his investors bankrupt. Along with his heavy drinking Larry just couldn't face the music of being indited for letting down his clients as well as as it was indicated in a number of newspapers headlines embezzling them and just walked out to Banning Point on the tip of the Atlantic Ocean and took his own life by jumping to his death. Penny growing up thinking that her father died of a heart attack needs Dr. Rossinger tells Lee to face the hard truth about Larry's death in order for her to snap out of the fantasy world that she as well Lee built around her and the more that she delays it the more she'll become incurable. Early Hollywood look at mental illness and very dated now but the fine acting especially by both female leads Cludette Colbert  June Allyson as well as the both honest and brutal insight for that time about the subject does grab you and hold your attention for the entire length of the film.There's also Lee's former suitor Chris Matthews Walter Pigeon whom she left for Larry as the love interest of both Lee and Penny who mistakes Chris' caring and kindness for her as an adult love affair. Penny is later driven to suicide when she realizes that her mother not her is the object of Chris grownup affection. Penny later finds out from Chase that their father killed himself and didn't die of natural causes which just brought the shocked and bereaved young girl to the point of selfdestruction. Running hysterically to Banner Point the same place where her dad killed himself to end it all Penny is confronted by a tearful Lee who breaks the news to her that she kept from Penny for ten years about the real reason for her father death and like Dr. Rossiger told her. It was Lee's guilt feelings that's the reason of why she worked so long and hard all those years as a realestate agent never having time to pay any serious attention towards her by paying off the dept that her father left in order to clear his name and reputation as an honest man. That was the magic bullet that broke the spell that Penny was under all these years and not only prevented her from killing herself but also brought her back to reality as well the real world.".

Along with his heavy drinking Larry just couldn't face the music of being indited for letting down his clients as well as as it was indicated in a number of newspapers headlines embezzling them and just walked out to Banning Point on the tip of the Atlantic Ocean and took his own life by jumping to his death. Penny growing up thinking that her father died of a heart attack needs Dr. Rossinger tells Lee to face the hard truth about Larry's death in order for her to snap out of the fantasy world that she as well Lee built around her and the more that she delays it the more she'll become incurable. Early Hollywood look at mental illness and very dated now but the fine acting especially by both female leads Cludette Colbert  June Allyson as well as the both honest and brutal insight for that time about the subject does grab you and hold your attention for the entire length of the film.There's also Lee's former suitor Chris Matthews Walter Pigeon whom she left for Larry as the love interest of both Lee and Penny who mistakes Chris' caring and kindness for her as an adult love affair. Penny is later driven to suicide when she realizes that her mother not her is the object of Chris grownup affection. Penny later finds out from Chase that their father killed himself and didn't die of natural causes which just brought the shocked and bereaved young girl to the point of selfdestruction. Running hysterically to Banner Point the same place where her dad killed himself to end it all Penny is confronted by a tearful Lee who breaks the news to her that she kept from Penny for ten years about the real reason for her father death and like Dr. Rossiger told her. It was Lee's guilt feelings that's the reason of why she worked so long and hard all those years as a realestate agent never having time to pay any serious attention towards her by paying off the dept that her father left in order to clear his name and reputation as an honest man. That was the magic bullet that broke the spell that Penny was under all these years and not only prevented her from killing herself but also brought her back to reality as well the real world.";

	schema:reviewBody "I won't rehash the plot as many viewers before me have already done that for us. I will say that I enjoyed the film as I have always liked the work of June Allyson and Claudette Colbert.It was a nice change to see June in a different kind of a role for her. I also liked her in The Shrike. In that one she also turned in a very different type of role expected of her. The problem for some viewers is that they don't want to see June in anything else except Little Miss Sunshine. Now June may not have been Meryl Streep but she was a good actress.I think the whole cast was fine and Robert Sterling as Claudette's adult son was very good. He and Claudette as stepson and stepmother exhibited a loving and believable relationship. It was also fun to see Elizabeth Patterson Mrs. Trumble from I Love Lucy as the housekeepercook. As for Miss Colbert I had the privilege of seeing her in two Broadway shows The Kingfisher and A Talent for Murder. She gave me an autograph and we enjoyed a brief chat at the stage door. She was gracious sweet and still beautiful. As for the film she was very strong and believable as the determined mother to take on all she needed to in order to provide for her children and to clean up her husband's mistakes.The Secret Heart maybe a bit melodramatic at times but as a product of the 1940's it is an interesting film and well made.".

After his wife dies he marries Lee Claudette Colbert which also means she takes on his two young children Penny June Allyson and Chase Robert Sterling.Larry turns to alcohol and also steals from his company. One night he refuses to attend a party with Lee content to drink and play the piano at home. Lee has a great time dancing with their mutual friend Chris Walter Pidgeon whom Lee met while she was engaged to Larry. Chris fell for her but Lee went ahead and married Larry though everyone stayed friends. When she gets home from the party and a visit to a nightclub Larry is dead a suicide.Lee keeps the headlines about his embezzlement from the children and tells them that their father died in a car accident. She then sets out to work and repay all of his debts. Because of Penny's resentment of her Lee tells Chris that he needs to keep away from them and she devotes herself to the children.Penny as a teenager is quite disturbed still upset about her father's death and feeling that she is a lot like him. Lee seeks psychiatric help for her. The psychiatrist tells Lee that Penny should know the truth about her father.Lee's first move is to reopen their old farm which is right near Chris' which will make Penny happy. Her brother Chase home from the service introduces her to a young soldier friend Marshall Thompson and he becomes very interested in Penny. Chris starts coming around. It looks as though everything is going in the right direction. Except no one realizes that Penny has another interest.This is a good movie a little on the noir side and it's a chance to see June Allyson do something besides enthusiasm. I had seen her dramatic side before and knew she had a wider range but I imagine it is a surprise for some. Colbert is absolutely beautiful and does well as a lovely sympathetic woman who only wants what is best for Larry's children. Robert Sterling is amiable and attractive as is Marshall Thompson. Both of them found success in television a few years later.There's an aura of suspense around the film as well as a warmth thanks to Colbert and Pidgeon. It's an interesting story of how one man's deeds affect the next generation and the woman and friend he leaves behind.".

There are so many other strong versatile actors in this one it's a shame they don't show it more often. Penny June Allyson THINKS she knows the truth about her dead father and is living in her own world when reality hits her head on. With Walter Pidgeon Claudette Colbert Lionel Barrymore and Robert Sterling it's a showcase of so many strong actors. All charismatic versatile personalities. There isn't room here to describe the strengths and history of most of them so maybe it'll be easier to describe the film's weakness  Allyson. She is still playing the wideeyed innocent but wayoffbasedaughter ignorant to the realities of life and the dark side of it. Claudette Colbert Lee Addams could play ANY part and also showed up in so many ww II flicks. My favorite Colbert film is of course Imitation of Life the first Better version. Pidgeon who appeared in SO many big films had just been nominated for his role in Madame Curie. Here he is Chris Matthews friend to Lee in a smaller role. Still a great film but could have been even better with that casting change. Just my little opinion.".

As a matter of fact Courtney Thorne Smith becomes his love interest in this one. I like her as an actress but she lacks the spunk to be that interesting. Ostensibly Julia Montgomery turned down to reprise her role because she was supposed to have dumped Lewis and she felt it would have negated all the changes her character made in this movie. It was a wise choice. Followed by two more sequels that went STV. I would skip this one if I were you it provides you with no laughs and it's dull3.610".

Probably a good film to watch when you are not functioning that well because then you will not really have the opportunity to realise just how bad this film is in comparison to the many great films out there. Yet still there are many that are worse and let us not forget this film was made in 1987 when comedies in the same vein as Nerds were immensely popular.

They start off the trip very well but once they get to the hotel they are kicked out by the Alpha jocks and mocked constantly. But they hang tough but the Alpha's are not going down so they frame the boys and try to make sure that they cannot be at the big conference so that they can be expelled from all the other charters. But the nerds have had enough and are going to make sure that the Alpha's go down once and for all.Now guaranteed this wasn't the first Revenge of the Nerds but Revenge of the Nerds II Nerds in Paradise was still a lot of fun to watch. The boys are still a lot of fun to watch I just loved how Ogre kept saying nerds! every time they would walk into a room he was such a fun addition for the story. I really liked this sequel and I think people just need to cut it a break.

Shockingly only Ogre is around from the Alpha Betas this time.Lots of predictably stupid yuks come from Poindexter's bottle bottom glasses and overall clumsiness and Booger's extreme lack of couth. Lamar and Wormser are mostly just there with Lamar glittering himself up more than he did in the first movie.Of course the Alpha Betas manage to get the tri Lambs kicked out of their desirable hotel reservation and of course they end up at the only other hotel available a horrendous fallendown fleabag. There is also a weird scene at a zoo parkbar.The best part of the movie happens in the opening credits where 38 Special plays a snappy tune Take me back to paradise. From there it's all downhill including some embarrassingly bad camera work for a major feature. In too many scenes there is a proscenium arch camera angle with no other cuts or edits as if a college kid on an iPad filmed every scene in one take and said editing?

The nerds are back for the most part the originals but the story is written so differently from the first. This film attempts to be a bit more humorous than the first but it falls flat. The humor is this one is the lowbrow type of humor so common today. It is either sophomoric sexual innuendo slapstick or scatological in nature and it's just not funny. I loved the first flick and expecting this not to be quite as good was nonetheless quite disappointed in it. The story line in this is also somewhat similar to the first film and didn't seem very original to me. The acting is just as good as it was in the original film but the writing and storyline are just not up to par with the original so not even decent acting can save it. A 5 only.".

The nerds' arrival at their onestar hotel the Hotel Coral Essex was hilarious to me. Who among us hasn't found ourselves in lessthandesirable accommodations at one time or another? From the chickens roaming inside to the unswimmable pool to the Peep Show establishment sharing the building this is the embodiment of everyone's vacation nightmare a la National Lampoon's Vacation but even more so. The CubanAmerican front desk clerk and her fervent love of Ricky Ricardo was a real treat. Those who did not laugh at these moments are likely those who are less experienced in life. I enjoyed the Florida stereotypes which were not all insulting  Sunny was a nice typical Florida girl having traveled there myself as well as the blastfromthepast 1980s settingfilming. The stereotype of the flamboyantly gay man in Lamar's character was enjoyable and humorous to me and I hope other viewers saw it in the light way that it was meant to be taken as well. I also hope that other viewers were not offended in any way by the portrayal of the African American chapter of TriLambda because I found them to be the most upstanding characters in both this film and the original. I would have liked to see those characters featured in even more scenes. While the absence of Gilbert on the trip was a little disappointing it was great to see him for a few moments here and there. Lewis carried the other scenes perfectly well by himself. With his sensitive nature and good looks beneath his nerd costuming it is not too much of a stretch to imagine beautiful yet emotionally mature and smart ladies like Sunny falling in love with Lewis. Finally POSSIBLE SPOILER? ALERT! I couldn't have asked for a happier ending than the conversion of one of the Alpha Betas. Some extra features on the DVD such as outtakes interviews cast biographies etc. would have been welcomed  appreciated but one can't have everything I guess!".

As in the first film the nerds must try to figure out a way to make those pretty people understand them. Considering how much money the first film made I guess it's a little bit shocking that it took them three years to get a sequel made but after viewing this thing it's obvious they didn't take that much time trying to come up with a good screenplay. With very few exceptions sequels are just the first film slightly altered but what really sinks this one is that we get watered down PG13 rated jokes that are just poor copies of great jokes from the first film. I've never fully understood why studios think they need to water down jokes to try and bring in a larger audience. Going by the box office numbers it's clear the PG13 rating wasn't what the film needed. What it did need was a better screenplay because what we get here is pretty lazy as the majority of the jokes fall flat on their face. The problem with many of them is that the characters here are so poorly written that most of the time we just see them acting overthetop and this really goes against what their characters were in the first movie. The entire idea of them traveling to Florida for some conference is pretty weak story wise and one must wonder why something better wasn't thought of. Robert Carradine returns as Lewis and while the performance is fine you can't help but notice how hard he's having to work to try and make up for the screenplay. Curtis Armstrong is also back as are a few others from the first film but the screenplay does none of them any favors. Even worse is Donald Gibb who gets nothing to do except making dumb sounds as Orge.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1980 horror film TERROR TRAIN might best be described as HALLOWEEN on the rails.  In it a fraternity has a party taking place on a train speeding through the Canadian night.  And then one by one without anyone knowing it a situation made even more complicated by the fact that everyone's dressed up in disguises they all get bumped off in shocking and violent fashion by a maniac.  And as with HALLOWEEN and THE FOG the heroine at the center of this is none other than Jamie Lee Curtis.But unlike most HALLOWEENinspired bloodfests TERROR TRAIN does boast a lot of good things to lift it above the worst of an alwaysbad bunch.  The director here is Roger Spottiswoode who served as a film editor for some of Sam Peckinpah's films including his 1971 horror film STRAW DOGS.  The train's conductor is portrayed by veteran character actor Ben Johnson a stalwart of both John Ford and Peckinpah who won a Supporting Actor Oscar in 1971 for THE LAST PICTURE SHOW.  Even more the atmospheric cinematography of TERROR TRAIN is provided by the legendary British camerman John Alcott whose groundbreaking work for Stanley Kubrick including 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY and THE SHINING is legendary.  Furthermore the violence and bloodshed are surprisingly kept relatively down and while the revelation of who the killer is may not in and of itself be so surprising it does give the opportunity for both Johnson and Curtis to be heroes.TERROR TRAIN may not be everyone's cup of tea and it doesn't really compare to HALLOWEEN but for those willing to take a spooky ride it is well worth it.".

	onyx:emotionText "The 1980 horror film TERROR TRAIN might best be described as HALLOWEEN on the rails.  In it a fraternity has a party taking place on a train speeding through the Canadian night.  And then one by one without anyone knowing it a situation made even more complicated by the fact that everyone's dressed up in disguises they all get bumped off in shocking and violent fashion by a maniac.  And as with HALLOWEEN and THE FOG the heroine at the center of this is none other than Jamie Lee Curtis.But unlike most HALLOWEENinspired bloodfests TERROR TRAIN does boast a lot of good things to lift it above the worst of an alwaysbad bunch.  The director here is Roger Spottiswoode who served as a film editor for some of Sam Peckinpah's films including his 1971 horror film STRAW DOGS.  The train's conductor is portrayed by veteran character actor Ben Johnson a stalwart of both John Ford and Peckinpah who won a Supporting Actor Oscar in 1971 for THE LAST PICTURE SHOW.  Even more the atmospheric cinematography of TERROR TRAIN is provided by the legendary British camerman John Alcott whose groundbreaking work for Stanley Kubrick including 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY and THE SHINING is legendary.  Furthermore the violence and bloodshed are surprisingly kept relatively down and while the revelation of who the killer is may not in and of itself be so surprising it does give the opportunity for both Johnson and Curtis to be heroes.TERROR TRAIN may not be everyone's cup of tea and it doesn't really compare to HALLOWEEN but for those willing to take a spooky ride it is well worth it.";

The cinematography is slicklywell done. The music score is unique and beautiful especially Alana's theme heard mostly in the beginning of the end credits. The cast is also in good form. Jamie Lee is good as her likable heroine self. Handsome Hart Bochner does well as the twofaced frat leader. Veteran actor Ben Johnson is a welcomed addition as the train conductor. Even David Copperfield manages to be a little menacing in his role as a mysterious magician. All together Terror Train does well making for a good slasherthriller with a few tricks up its sleeves.

Hart Bochner plays the coward Doc annoyed me and glad he got his just desserts and once again Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as the lead heroine and gives the best chase scene in this movie which is the main highlight of this movie in my books.All in all Terror Train is an underrated gem and a highlight on Jamie Lee Curtis's glowing CV.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fraternity prank on a weakling of a student goes horribly wrong when the victim is emotionally affected by it and ends up in an institution. Now three years have past and the senior fraternity friends have decided to celebrate their final outing with a New Year's Eve costume party on a train. But an uninvited guest has managed to stall away on the train by killing off students and using their costumes to pose as that person to lure their next victim. After a death or two  Carne the train's conductor discovers the bodies and he goes into investigation mode along with one of the initial victims Elena.All aboard the train of death but you got to make some room for partying and David Copperfield! Wow let's break out the streamers as that sounds like a great time. Yeah it sounds like but it doesn't entirely eventuate. Being there would be more fun than watching it. Terror Train is a competent looking slasher by director Roger Spottiswoode but here we go again in the formulaic stakes which isn't too bad because it's slickly done with a different and claustrophobic setting. But I found too many aimless spurts with tired gags and constant drinking and dancing  instead of giving us the real good stuff and when it finally does it's not terribly worththewait. Damn even Copperfield gets enough screen time doing his bag of tricks that I was hoping he would magically disappear off the train! Sure his tricks are entertaining and what so but was it trying to distract us from the really unoriginal story telling and a lack of suspense and blood. The novelty behind the plot with a costume party aboard a speeding train is a good idea with many possible outcomes but the fractured script doesn't take full advantage of it and actually decides to display the usual ingredients vague characters and stale clichs. Even the mystery side of the story is poorly executed with red herrings that don't work. It's slightly entertaining but more effort could have gone into the story's structure and shock tactics. Most of the cutaway deaths are swiftly tame and slimpickings. While the film only goes for about 90 minutes it does feel longer because of some long dry spells of dull chinwag and tedious fooling around. There are some redeeming qualities in this faultfilled production. Firstly there is a richly thick atmosphere with the train being covered in shadowy patches and gloomy lighting that enhances the tight air. Sometimes it was that dim that a flare would have worked wonders. The film is filled with lush photography and a rattling score although the profound disco music can be quite sore on the ears. While the opening of the film was rather sleepy there are a few intense builds ups and an explosive showdown between heroine and killer in the final third. Spottiswoode's capable direction keeps the film level with some flair and the performances by the always watchable Jamie Lee Curtis who just reprises her signature scream queen role and Ben Johnson is decent in a minor sense. The rest of the performances are forgettable with the usual cheeky drunken frats and you got the stiff looking David Copperfield.Terror Train is a modest slasher affair all round that at times is a bit too convenient but while there are some restrictions it still mildly entertains.".

The film doesn't have the substance and art that Halloween or The Fog but one might find that Terror Train is an above average slasher film that like its fellow Curtis movies relies more on story and thrills than blood and guts. This movie truly puts others like Prom Night My Bloody Valentine Madman Happy Birthday to Me and Graduation Day to shame and one could easily argue that its better than the extremely popular Friday the 13th films.Terror Train is a little more complicated than most slasher fares. It is about a fraternity holding a New Year's Eve costume party on a train but someone has boarded the train with a vendetta against the college kids for an accidental prank that occurred several years beforehand. While on the train the killer takes on the costumed identity of whoever he kills so who is the killer and who is just dressed up. Its got a great plot and the movie delivers some as well.Jamie Lee Curtis and Ben Johnson are the stars of this movie but other big names are included as well. David Copperfield is one of them he does his job playing himself basically but the true acting chops go to Hart Bochner who plays the stuck up rude and mostly mean fraternity brother responsible for the accident years ago. Ben Johnson is of course good but his role is limited to a train conductor. Jamie Lee Curtis is pretty much playing yet another heroine in a horror movie and her performance is stellar but nothing special.Terror Train is a great slasher film recommended for slasher fans. It has its plot holes but overall its makes up for them with a good story some decent suspense and a great twist ending that you won't soon forget. It definitely doesn't fall off the tracks.Terror Train is available on DVD only on a simple DVD with just the theatrical trailer included. The impending remake may bring about a special edition.".

	schema:headline " Decent entry if not overtly spectacular";
	schema:reviewBody "Terror Train is one of the better entries in the slasher cycle.SPOILERSThree years ago Alaina Maxwell Jaime Lee Curtis humiliates the class nerd in college during a prep rally by accident. When the class takes a trip on a train as a graduation party she goes along with the others partying. Unknowingly the entire class is being watched from the shadows by an unknown person. The class members start dying along the route and the conductor Carne Ben Johnson is the one who keeps finding the bodies. He informs the class that a killer is on the train but when they can't find him after a sweep they demand to be let back on. Alaina finds that the killer is after her and tries to fight him off and stay alive.The Good News As the slasher cycle started getting it'd feet in the late 70s it was inevitable that the copycats would come out at some point. Fortunately this is a copycat but a really good one. The familiar clichs found in the genre make for predictable viewing but the way they're accomplished are what sets it apart. The film has some wonderful suspense moments that are courtesy of the spectacular camera work. After being locked out of her compartment a figure approaches down a darkened hallway. This leads to a short chase where it's revealed to be a false alarm but the idea was still there because of the camera work. The highlight though is the clever and downright creepy ending sequence where after a brief struggle a character locks themself in a compartment in the same room with the killer. After several attempts to break in the killer grabs a long pole and knocks out every light in the room rendering it totally dark. It sets up a brilliant series of shock jumps that is only due to the camera making sure that the darkened part of the room is the main focus of the sequence. It's a great sequence that really sticks out. The doubletwist with the killer's identity is nice as the first one is pretty easy to guess but the second one is a great one that does come from out of the blue.The Bad News There's really nothing in the way of gore here. A couple of aftereffects and finding some bodies with knives and other objects found in them but that's pretty much it. Considering that it has some deaths that needed some blood as well as a couple offscreen as well lowers the gore content pretty drastically. Considering the time it came out this should've been a little more gorier. Plus the film does fall into the slasher cannon of the time so it is fairly predictable and really offers nothing new.The Final Verdict Coming out at the right time in horror history didn't hurt it at all. It's Halloween on a train so that should really be the definitive response giving by this. Slasher fans with find a lot of good things here but nonslashers will pretty much find this to be another bythenumbers movie.Rated R Violence some Language and Brief Nudity".

	onyx:emotionText "Terror Train is one of the better entries in the slasher cycle.SPOILERSThree years ago Alaina Maxwell Jaime Lee Curtis humiliates the class nerd in college during a prep rally by accident. When the class takes a trip on a train as a graduation party she goes along with the others partying. Unknowingly the entire class is being watched from the shadows by an unknown person. The class members start dying along the route and the conductor Carne Ben Johnson is the one who keeps finding the bodies. He informs the class that a killer is on the train but when they can't find him after a sweep they demand to be let back on. Alaina finds that the killer is after her and tries to fight him off and stay alive.The Good News As the slasher cycle started getting it'd feet in the late 70s it was inevitable that the copycats would come out at some point. Fortunately this is a copycat but a really good one. The familiar clichs found in the genre make for predictable viewing but the way they're accomplished are what sets it apart. The film has some wonderful suspense moments that are courtesy of the spectacular camera work. After being locked out of her compartment a figure approaches down a darkened hallway. This leads to a short chase where it's revealed to be a false alarm but the idea was still there because of the camera work. The highlight though is the clever and downright creepy ending sequence where after a brief struggle a character locks themself in a compartment in the same room with the killer. After several attempts to break in the killer grabs a long pole and knocks out every light in the room rendering it totally dark.

	schema:headline " Pretty silly but you might enjoy it anyway";
	schema:reviewBody "As far as 80s slasher movies go Terror Train could easily be mentioned among the worst of them. It has a very silly story involving a fraternity that pulls a vicious stunt on a naive young pledge by getting one of their girlfriends Jamie Lee Curtis to lure him into bed with a corpse at a New Year's Eve party. It sends him over the edge and he goes to a mental hospital. Three years later the fraternity holds another New Year's Eve party this time on an old steam engine locomotive train. A killer slips aboard and exacts revenge on the partygoers. Is it the prank victim from three years ago and if so where is he? It's the kind of premise that only happens in slasher movies and not in real life. However Terror Train does have a few big things going for it and I was surprised at how much I liked it anyway. John Alcott does wonders with the movie's cinematography here and it helps that the train sets are very realistic and claustrophobic. Alcott plays some of my favorite horror film cards working movie magic with shadows and lighting. This is the main reason that anything in the movie works at all because Terror Train actually has very little suspense as far as the story goes. The kills are mostly unscary in and of themselves but the photography and the design of the shots really stretches the material as far as it will go. There are a couple of great boo shocks that might give you a thrill including a few wellorchestrated handgrabfromnowhere moments.The filmmakers were also lucky that they had some acting talent on hand. Obviously their trump card was Jamie Lee Curtis who was the number one box office draw for these types of films at the time. She is absolutely luminous in this movie especially since most of the other characters are completely flat. Watching this film you can really see why she became a star she was already light years ahead of the material and this was still near the very beginning of her career. Ben Johnson also turns out to be a major presence in the film as the conductor and if any real comparisons are to be made between this film and Halloween Johnson would be the in Dr. Loomis spot opposite Jamie Lee here.But comparisons to Halloween are mostly superfluous. The director wasn't going for John Carpenter here and he does have a nice sense of style. What brings the film down is a heavy sense of deja vu not to mention the huge lapses in logic which are right on the surface here. For instance there is a rather obvious conversation near the beginning of the film where the conductor reveals that the train has no radio. We also spend a lot of the movie wondering why Jamie Lee Curtis' character would be involved in such a mean prank. Of course the script dictates that she didn't know the extent of what was going on but we still question whether she's the good girl or not.The script isn't very sly in terms of its plot exposition and the murders themselves are unrealistic especially one victim who is smashed into a bathroom mirror. You also might wonder how the killer could manage donning all the different costumes in the film especially when his identity is revealed at the conclusion you'd have to have already seen the movie to understand but it involves a spoiler I would not dare give away because it is one of the big pleasures of Terror Train.David Copperfield is actually very memorable as...well as a magician. Ironically his illusions are way more interesting than this entire movie. A few of the tricks look like they were done with movie magic instead of real time but they're very entertaining nonetheless.Of course the goods come at the climax of the film where JLC must go up against the psycho killer alone. At this point her characters still hadn't learned how to actually finish the killer off with the first strike choosing instead to inflict what must be flesh wounds in hopes of warding him off. But the final confrontation is genuinely creepy if a little unbelievable.The violence isn't quite as graphic as other films of the genre. There is a severed head rather unconvincing and a few bloody scenes but otherwise it's fairly tame stuff. Nothing in the movie quite gels and I can't really say Terror Train is any kind of classic but its own relative obscurity actually works in its favor at this point. Aside from its initial cableTV run in the early 80s as well as a brief release on video  laserdisc shortly after the film almost disappeared into obscurity until its recent DVD revival. Therefore the few shocks it contains are not yet overexposed and the film isn't often seen. Even though it's not a great film and in many ways is quite stupid I did enjoy it anyway and I will probably be watching it again.".

The plot is a college fraternity hosts a New Year's Eve costume party upon a moving train. Simple enough and sometimes simple plots are the best kinds of plots to go with though the simplicity of Terror Train makes it seem dull and mediocre at times. I liked the very cool and unexpected twists this movie had though and even though sometimes the characters were annoying they were nicely done and they commingled with the type of atmosphere the film had perfectly.It tries to be more than it is at times but if you can appreciate BMovie horrors or are just a horror fan in all it is a good time though nothing to really praise. Overall Terror Train was very interesting and a nice edition to the slasher genre. There's not much I can really say about it but it's satisfying in a sense and I recommend it if you think you'll get any enjoyment out of watching it.".

It's the sort of thing you'd expect from Halloween. If more thought had been put into this flick we could have had a great slasher  Halloween set on a train.

	schema:reviewBody "Following in the wake of HALLOWEEN Jamie Lee Curtis found herself in a number of inferior slasher films inspired by that classic movie. PROM NIGHT and TERROR TRAIN are the bestknown examples. TERROR TRAIN is refreshingly different from the other slasher movies of the period inevitably they all follow a strict boring sexanddeath formula which quickly becomes tiring after you've seen halfadozen in having an interesting location on which the action is set but the question is whether this stops the movie being a runofthemill slasher set on a train.The answer is a resounding yes. Basically this movie has everything you need from a slasher plentiful gore cheesy and dated fashions a high death toll some stalkandslash sequences and even a is he dead or isn't he? finale. What comes as the biggest surprise is that this movie actually manages to be scary on the odd occasion on top of all this. Whether it's the killer's creepy Groucho mask or the suspensepacked sequence in which a victim searches for the murderer in his train compartment TERROR TRAIN is topnotch stuff which while derivative of HALLOWEEN still manages to feel fresh and entertaining unlike the later slashers that came in the mid '80s and rehashed tired formulas over and over.Oddly this movie keeps the identity of the murderer hidden until the end which is strange because to anybody who has seen the prologue it should be pretty clear. The deaths are all different so that they don't become boring and while they're not particularly graphic they cleverly make you use your imagination to think that you've seen more than you have for instance we see a body being crushed by a train briefly but hear plenty of yucky sound effects and in another instance we see the initial start of a boy's throat being slashed and the movie lets our imagination do the rest. Thus the film appears more gory than it actually is.The sequences in which the train conductor played by Ben Johnson discovers the bloody corpses are genuinely frightening and here it is that the movie resembles my favourite 'train' film HORROR EXPRESS. A bloody severed head provides a nice shock while Curtis  in her oneonone with the killer  manages to wound her attacker repeatedly with paininducing weapons! The finale sees a literally bloodsoaked Curtis battling with the murderer for a final time. This ending may be highly derivative of HALLOWEEN but it's done so well that you can't help liking it.The cast is made of the typical obnoxious teenage types Hart Bochner plays a particularly despicable character whose death is fully deserved with the exception of Jamie Lee Curtis who is as good as ever as the screaming heroine. Ben Johnson provides a touch of real acting and oldworld class as the train conductor whom you can feel safe with while a cheesylooking David Copperfield is on hand to perform all manner of cool magic tricks  and ends up being repeatedly impaled with swords for his troubles.The spooky score serves to add to the tension while good photography keeps the movie watchable  even in some of the overlong teen exposition scenes in which nothing happens. Director Roger Spottiswoode who lately did a Bond film I believe however shows a firm grasp of pacing wracking things up to nerveshattering tension at the end. The emphasis is on shadows and darkness which helps make the movie really frightening and even the payoff doesn't disappoint. If you can get over the fact that this is a HALLOWEEN ripoff you'll realise that it's actually one of the best of the bunch and a whole lot of fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Looking at the plot for 1980's Terror Train one could easily dismiss it off hand as a copy of Halloween1978 with the exception of it taking place on train. However for all the similarities between the two films there is something to be said for Terror Train and its ability to tell a fun engaging story. The film opens with a fraternity party prank gone wrong involving nerdy Kenny Hampson the too smart for their own good frat boys and an unwitting Alana Maxwell Jamie Lee Curtis. Fastforward a few years later and we find the same fraternity getting ready for a New Year's Eve costume party on boardthat's right you guessed ita train. Little do they know however that one of their companions has been murdered his costume stolen and now a killer stalks the drunk college kids taking their costumes after each murder so in order to confuse his victims! Will Alana and her friends figure out who the killer is before it's too late? A big part of the fun of Terror Train comes from the mystery and simple tactics used by the filmmakers. By giving the killer different masks and identities the producers here are able to incorporate a sense of mystery into the story. Who is the killer? What's his motive? Does this have something to do with what happened to Kenny Hampson? Another factor that adds suspense is where the film is set. Unlike in say Halloween you can't just run out of the house or building because on a moving train rolling through the dead of winter there's simply no where to run except to the next car and then the next until you run out of cars to run to. First time director Roger Spottiswoode does well in creating a claustrophobic atmosphere and it's obvious he watched and learned when he was an editor for the legendary Sam Pekinpah. As far as acting is concerned everyone here does an admirable job. Jamie Lee Curtis despite the fact she must of been tired of the slasher genre by now gives everything she has to the part and in typical fashion for her characters does an excellent job of playing scared but still turning out to be the heroine we all know she is. In addition to her we have character acting great Ben Johnson in the role of down to earth train conductor Carne who finds out he has a lot more to worry about than just drunken college kids! With his friendly demeanor and good old country accent Johnson is able to provide a beacon of hope and stability on the train ride from hell. And in what has to be one of the most random casting decisions ever David Copperfield Yes THE David Copperfield has a spot here as the mysterious magician hired to put on a show and does an excellent job both as an actor and of course in magic. He couldn't have been much older than twenty here but even then you'll wonder how he is able to do what he does without being endowed with supernatural powers. In short Terror Train is a film that was made during the time when slasher pictures still had some quality to them and for that reason no horror fan should pass up the chance to see it. So climb aboard enjoy the ride and watch your costumed friend very closely because you just never know who might be under there!".

Four years later the group of friends boards a Train on New Years Eve and Hampson is there ready to stalk and kill his former classmates. There is a costume party going on and Hampson wears several different masks as he slices his way through the group. Killings include impalement by sword Slashed throat decapitation to name a few. Alana Curtis the most innocent of the group since she didn't really know what kind of prank was being played is left for last. First time director Roger Spottiswoode uses moody camerawork from excellent cinematographer John Alcott and decent sets ups to raise Terror Train above a lot of the slashers being produced in the early 1980's. In many ways it is sort of the same old stuff but Spottiswoode's sets ups to the deaths and the closed confines of the train make for some good atmosphere. All thought there isn't any doubt who the killer is the masked character doesn't speak and is quite creepy. The movie bogs down in the middle with a crappy magic act done to disco music with real life magician David Copperfield who seems lost here and too many scenes of the kids dancing and partying. It makes up for it with a tense final 20 minutes as Alana is the last one left and is chased through the train. A certain highlight comes when Alana locks herself in a caged room with the killer trying to get at her! Jamie Lee Curtis is terrific as she shrieks and fights for her life in what is her best Scream queen role outside of the original Halloween. Ben Johnson as the conductor brings a professionalism the film needed and Hart Bochner is extra slimy as the head prankster Doc. Overall an above average slasher film from the golden age of the slasher.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jamie Lee Curtis electrifies the opening scene of Terror Train with her beaming toothy smile. She was a beautiful young actress. Sadly because of her trite label as the Scream Queen I believe she never reached her full potential. She was terrific in A Fish Called Wanda True Lies and even Halloween but she could've really been a talent. However she settled for something that may not be as prestigious but is just as remembered as an Academy Award being the face of a genre that always draws fans. She's very good in Terror Train although it feels like a very similar role to those she portrayed in Halloween and Prom Night there's something stronger about the character that makes Curtis work standout more.There are some stereotypical college partying scenes and generic characters but Terror Train is very entertaining. With movies such as this you can't judge them on a regular film rating scale that you would judge film such as The Godfather Taxi Driver or Citizen Kane with. Instead you have to look at what's in front of you. Terror Train isn't a film with ambitious goals to meet it's meant to purely entertain its audience and it does an acceptable job at that. It's a decent of the genre and for what it sets out to be. The exposition of horror films in the 1980s was dreadful all falling to the same fate. They barely involve the viewer in the characters or the story they keep them afar from the action. Terror Train has traces of that in explaining the characters besides the character of Jamie Lee Curtis and the train conductor. All the other indistinguishable characters are expressed to have no moral values. Other problems Terror Train runs into is the convenient plot devices working in the plot's favor the train used take has no radio...hmm?. Sometimes the screenplay has the characters do things just to say they did them without but the plot wasn't advanced by said action. The choreography of the final chase scene was so sloppy it was probably put together a few minutes before shooting.Setting can sometimes make or break a horror film and I love the setting in Terror Train! It's ominous spooky and gives a distinctive quality to the horror flick. Hitchcock used trains a lot in his films the setting serves as an homage to the legend in a way. The different color of lights are used to create mood and it's mostly effective. The villain works in Terror Train very well. It's a different take on the antagonist in a horror film the mask at the beginning was my favorite face of the killer. Terror Train holds the anticipation of the killings but its a film that rejects the graphic violent scenes. I'm not sure if it adds to retracts the film's overall quality but it's certainly noticed with each death. Is Terror Train bursting with originality? No. Does it use clichs of the 1980s horror films? Yes. It's not an expertly made film but I did enjoy the time I spent watching it. It's more entertaining than Prom Night but lacks Halloween's brilliance and insight. Rating 510Grade C".

	schema:headline " Great atmosphere but no great characters";
	schema:reviewBody "Terror Train starts off with young people around a campfire checking each other out. The scene is awkward and strange with kid's furtive glances over the big fire outdoors. We see a group of young guys teasing each other about sex which leads to a sick joke played on someone in the group. A scene that doesn't wrap up well. Later the same group is on a train for a Halloween party to end all. The interior car sets are excellent and the cars even rock back and forth while the characters party. A nice touch. The lighting the colors the costumes are all great. Oddly enough even though the cars are small and cramped at times the film doesn't seem claustrophobic just tight. The problem here isn't with the familiar 10 Little Indians story. The problem is with the characters. There isn't anyone likable here. Is that intentional so we don't mind if one by one they are all bumped off? At times it does seem like they focused on most of the unpleasant characters. Even the socalled hero of the film isn't really that likable. With that in mind there is sort of a lack of punch here. Even when it is confirmed who the killer is it isn't suspenseful. It is just creepy because of the way the actor portrayed his part. Heshe isn't likable either. So if a horror film is to be successful we are all told that there must be someone to root for and that isn't here. Other than that though the film has a unique atmosphere and isn't bad. I doubt anyone will want to sit through it over  over though like Halloween.".
