Hepburn had asked that Tracy and Gable be her leading men but looking at this film for all the chemistry that Tracy and Hepburn ever had and all the talent Gable had for acting in comedic farce I can't imagine either of them playing any of the two leading males that are after Tracy Lord's love. That Grant plays C. K. Dexter Dex Haven so perfectly well and his opening scene with Hepburn is the stuff of movie history only rectifies that. That Stewart embodies the essence of MaCauley Connors as if he were in fact the character just proves how strong an actor he was and one who didn't have to resort to extreme emoting to make his point. That the three make for the most memorable romantic triangle in film history is probably an understatement.Of course the story is old. Of course the character motivations are dated. THE PHILADELPHIA STORY belongs perpetually in its own time the late 1930s when it was written and performed on stage when sensibilities towards the rich were much different than they are today. The whole bit of the society princess being humbled to become a better person is really a thinly disguised fable that tells the story of how Hepburn who had made such a powerful debut in film with her appearance in A BILL OF DIVORCEMENT quickly established a personality so abrasive she wouldn't do interviews or cheesecake it is rare to find a Hepburn picture from the 30s where she is dolled up that it translated into boxoffice bomb after bomb and by 1938 she was all but washed up. Tracy Lord's return to humankind is really the story of Hepburn's return to the world of acting even if she retained her abrasiveness to her last days. And of course who better suited for this role than Hepburn herself who had done the role on stage and by the time Hollywood came reluctantly calling  they wanted Norma Shearer who in my opinion could have carried it off but differently  knew the part in and out and owned the rights to the play in a shrewd move. We can't imagine anyone else playing this role which is why when the inevitable musical remake was made in 1956 with Grace Kelly in the lead it misfires and no amount of Cole Porter could save it even if it was a commercial success.But regardless being dated maybe too talky for some what a movie. To see the utter craziness of the plot which backfires at least twice and creates a sense of really not knowing what will happen next even when we know on a certain level Hepburn and Grant will wind up in each other's arms is the stuff romantic comedy is made of.

	schema:headline " Great dialogue great performances and a real fun urgent pace to the material make this a delightfully fun film";
	schema:reviewBody "It is the wedding of the year with socialite Tracy Lord due to marry George Kittredge behind closed doors with no press allowed. However the editor of Spy Magazine is set to run an expos of Tracy's philandering father and a New York dancer and strikes a deal with her ex husband CK Dexter Haven if he can get a couple of journalists into the wedding and the reception. Keen to get back at Tracy Dexter agrees to help and escorts writer Mike Conner and photographer Liz Imbrie into the Lord home in the days before the wedding. With tensions high between Dexter and Tracy everyone playing games and relationships equally confused and confusing anything could happen and surprises are in store.Shot in about 8 weeks with a low number of takes and some impressive adlibbed and oneshot scenes this is a movie worth seeing even before you look at the cast list and the professional reviews. The plot is partly a comedy partly a character drama and partly a romance albeit a rather tidy one and each aspect pretty much works in tandem with the others. The comic tension between the characters is really well written and although it is a clich it does fizz and spark across the screen and is regularly hilarious and consistently a delight to the ears. With such superficial energy it would be easy to ignore the fact that it is interesting below this specifically I liked the character of Tracy and the way that parts of the film show her character being stripped back as she in particular learns something about how she comes across softening her character a little bit in later scenes. However to suggest that this has great depths is to give it more praise than it deserves because it doesn't run deep and it isn't a great drama. Likewise the romance isn't a main part of it but it does still work because it is all delivered at such a fresh and funny pace that it draws you in even to the point where I gratefully accepted the film's conclusion with a smile rather than a sneer.The cast are a delight but then that pretty much goes without saying and they work with the dialogue like a surgeon uses a scalpel. In fact that is a good example because the dialogue is normally almost as sharp as said instrument. Grant may have got top billing and the big money which he then donated away but it is very much a shared effort between the three stars with Grant in fact having the least showy character. If anything the film belongs to Hepburn who is a delight whether spitting back at her father with tears in her eyes or a barbed comment sliding in like a greased knife. Stewart is just as good and is reaction shots show a real comic timing but he also gives good dialogue and he is fun. Like Stewart Grant has a great chemistry with Hepburn which means that he can deliver convincing tension and trade insults without undermining the ending which otherwise would have maybe been an ask too far. Hussey is good and it is easy to forget that she must have felt a bit out of her depth but it never shows in her performance. Support is roundly strong from Young Nash Halliday and even Weildler.Overall this is a delightful film that is such fun and has such a good pace and spark that it is easy to buy into the weaker elements of the narrative and not only forgive them but get into them. The dialogue is sparky and funny while the delivery of same is just what the material deserved. The cast have chemistry and help inject urgency to the story that keeps it all moving forward. A wonderfully delightful film that is fun to watch and surprisingly engaging.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is the wedding of the year with socialite Tracy Lord due to marry George Kittredge behind closed doors with no press allowed. However the editor of Spy Magazine is set to run an expos of Tracy's philandering father and a New York dancer and strikes a deal with her ex husband CK Dexter Haven if he can get a couple of journalists into the wedding and the reception. Keen to get back at Tracy Dexter agrees to help and escorts writer Mike Conner and photographer Liz Imbrie into the Lord home in the days before the wedding. With tensions high between Dexter and Tracy everyone playing games and relationships equally confused and confusing anything could happen and surprises are in store.Shot in about 8 weeks with a low number of takes and some impressive adlibbed and oneshot scenes this is a movie worth seeing even before you look at the cast list and the professional reviews. The plot is partly a comedy partly a character drama and partly a romance albeit a rather tidy one and each aspect pretty much works in tandem with the others. The comic tension between the characters is really well written and although it is a clich it does fizz and spark across the screen and is regularly hilarious and consistently a delight to the ears. With such superficial energy it would be easy to ignore the fact that it is interesting below this specifically I liked the character of Tracy and the way that parts of the film show her character being stripped back as she in particular learns something about how she comes across softening her character a little bit in later scenes. However to suggest that this has great depths is to give it more praise than it deserves because it doesn't run deep and it isn't a great drama. Likewise the romance isn't a main part of it but it does still work because it is all delivered at such a fresh and funny pace that it draws you in even to the point where I gratefully accepted the film's conclusion with a smile rather than a sneer.The cast are a delight but then that pretty much goes without saying and they work with the dialogue like a surgeon uses a scalpel. In fact that is a good example because the dialogue is normally almost as sharp as said instrument. Grant may have got top billing and the big money which he then donated away but it is very much a shared effort between the three stars with Grant in fact having the least showy character. If anything the film belongs to Hepburn who is a delight whether spitting back at her father with tears in her eyes or a barbed comment sliding in like a greased knife. Stewart is just as good and is reaction shots show a real comic timing but he also gives good dialogue and he is fun. Like Stewart Grant has a great chemistry with Hepburn which means that he can deliver convincing tension and trade insults without undermining the ending which otherwise would have maybe been an ask too far. Hussey is good and it is easy to forget that she must have felt a bit out of her depth but it never shows in her performance.

This is called Katharine Hepburn's best role by many while I admit she is excellent in a number of scenes I think she tends to overact at times. Cary Grant is great here. Everyone else is Great but I believe James Stewart to be the standout. He is perfect for this role its a flawless performance that he deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for.The Script has wonderful dialogue thats delivered flawlessly by the actors. Even simple dialogue like Isn't that awful was delivered superbly by Katharine Hepburn. George Cukor made this project look like nothing he made many films which were womens films but he does a damn good job here.If you think Romantic Comedies of today are good look at The Philadelphia Story and they will pale in comparison. The Philadelphia Story is a very good film and worth remembering unlike the mediocre to crappy romantic comedies of today. The Philadelphia Story is highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "They say the idle rich is the devil's playground.  Well never has the playground been more playful or fun than in The Philadelphia Story.  It's so gratifying to know that vintage movies like The Philadelphia Story will outlive us all.  Playwright Phillip Barry certainly had an ear for sophisticated chatter and along with Bringing Up Baby and Holiday he singlehandedly defined the term screwball comedy in the late 30s.  And so it is fortunate for all of us that the screen adaptations of each of these classic Broadway plays are classics in their own right.Katharine Hepburn who starred with Cary Grant in all three of the aforementioned films plays society prig Tracy Lord a spoiled temperamental rich girl who owns a will of iron and a heart to match. What she wants more than life itself is to experience true love like a downtoearth REAL person but is she capable of it?  A stormy first marriage to C.K. Dexter Haven Grant has not taken the wind out of her sails so she decides to make a go of it again.  Announcing her forthcoming marriage to wealthy George Kittredge a rather staid uptight sort it comes off more like a match made in gold than in heaven.  However the stubborn Tracy is convinced she is in love this time.  Around to disrupt the wedding plans is Tracy's former husband who still has feelings for her and her family her estranged scandalridden father her young precocious sister and a posteriorpinching uncle.  Also hovering around the Lord estate is tabloid reporter Liz Imbrie and her photographer Mike Connor assigned to cover the impending nuptials and of course scout out any juicy gossip.With a deft ensemble and crisp intuitive direction George Cukor the dialogue blisters with furious fun courtesy of Oscarwinning scripter Donald Ogden Stewart with every character having his or her chance to bask in the limelight.  Hepburn who was considered boxoffice poison at the time revitalized her Hollywood career with The Philadelphia Story smartly buying the film rights to ensure her starring role.  Dripping with frillyedged sarcasm she makes full use of her clipped Bryn Mawr speech tones.  But her ultimate triumph is that her 'ice queen' demeanor never alienates the viewer.  We still root for Tracy to come down to earth rejoin the human race and live out that fairy tale ending.  Cary Grant is as smooth as silk pajamas as Tracy's first husband raring and ready to pull her off that mighty pedestal she's placed herself so high on.  Synonymous with elegance and style I doubt there is another actor who can handle martinidry banter the way he does.  He is flawless  in a class by himself.The real revelation however is Jimmy Stewart as the smitten photographer who is only too willing to keep Tracy perched on that pedestal.  Stewart who won the Oscar breaks from his usual aw shucks mode to show a surprising comic range.  His midnight poolside soliloquy with Kate is wondrous and lingers long after the closing credits.  Completing the romantic quadrangle is the wonderful Ruth Hussey who inherits the wisecracking Eve Arden role the goodnatured trooper who always seems to come in second manwise.  Hussey takes the ball and runs with it giving the ripest performance of the bunch.Additional praise must be given to Mary Nash as Tracy's flowery meticulous mother young tomboy Virginia Weidler an adroit little scenestealer for keeping up with the big folks and offering a wickedly smartassed rendition of Lydia the Tattooed Lady John Howard for his dour stuffy groomtobe and good sportsmanship as the butt of many a joke John Halliday who manages a couple of razorsharp scenes as Hepburn's reproaching father and Roland Young who played Cosmo Topper in the delightful Topper film series for adding his typical brand of bemused merriment as lecherous Uncle Willy.   From the opening classic bit with Hepburn and Grant squaring off to the church altar denouement The Philadelphia Story provides a wealth of entertainment.  It's a rare rich package even the Lord family can't buy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Katharine Hepburn my favourite actress gives the performance of her career as Tracy Lord a spoilt Philadelphia socialite. The movie is a triple treat with my other two most favourite actors Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart in the other lead roles Cary as Tracy's former husband C.K Dexter Haven and Jimmy as the peeved reporter who Kate falls in love with. Although there has been much written about Jimmy Stewart not deserving the Oscar that year if it was given for the Academy passing over his performance in Mr Smith Goes to Washington then it was well deserved. Cary Grant deserved a nomination and Kate definitely should have taken out the prize for the year. I could be going to extremes but I think this was definitely the movie that deserved to take home the statuette for Best Picture of 1940. I have seen both Rebecca and The Grapes of Wrath movies highly acclaimed that year but neither has ever come close to The Philadelphia Story. The first time I watched it I missed not only most of the witty oneliners but the whole point of the story. It was the first movie I watched with each of the three stars. Almost a year later after I viewed it again I couldn't believe how I could have passed over such a rare gem. As a fourteen year old I can't be pretentious in definitely knowing the real themes of the movie. Maybe something in the way of humility and degrees of acceptance I'm not so sure. I have thought about it a lot but have only reached the conclusion that it is one of those 'feel good' movies that is rewatchable. There are things about it even close to my tenth viewing that I am still picking up on. Lead by Ruth Hussey and Virginia Weidler the supporting cast of The Philadelphia Story is one of the finest I have seen. With Cole Porter songs and yet another star cast this movie was shockingly remade into the musical High Society in 1956. On all accounts Bing Crosby Grace Kelly Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm cannot match the sophistication and wit of the nonmusical cast. It seemed too much like recycled humour despite its attempts to modernize an immortal story.This movie is a slice of Old Hollywood that must not be sampled once to enjoy it. It should be taken in many times! Rating 1010".

In fact the strategic use of such innuendoes as 'intact' made me wonder if the GrantHepburn marriage had ever been consummated.

After all if the production's got this many illustrious names it's got to be a classic. For a revealing contrast catch the GrantHepburnHawks genuinely funny Bringing Up Baby made only two years earlier. At least Hawks knew how to edit a scene without letting it drone on and on.

	schema:headline " You know there's something wrong when a film makes you root for the 'bad guy' ...";
	schema:reviewBody "George Cukor's The Philadelphia Story was released in 1940 and starred the ultimate Hollywood trinity Katharine Hepburn James Stewart and Cary Grant. Being a romantic comedy we suspect she will end up with one of these two. And since she's about to marry a boring guy named George we quickly understand that she will not marry him and that the whole story will consist on leading us to that conclusion in two hours two endlessly and unstoppably long hours.I hate to use the word 'overrated' and 'overacted' so I guess the wrong mindset would be an inevitable obstacle between this movie and me. Being the average schmuck I am I couldn't relate to Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord a young and wealthy socialite praised adored worshiped by the other schmucks of her community. For my biggest displeasure I couldn't even relate to James Stewart because as much as I loved his roles in Capra films I didn't find any invitation for empathy in his character as Macaulay Connor the wannabe writer and tabloid journalist for a magazine fittingly named 'Spy. I could care about Cary Grant as C.K. as in 'CocKy Dexter Morgan the exhusband if only for the hilarious way he palms Tracy's face and pushes her down to the floor. But isn't it a bad omen when the film's most memorable instant happens within the first minute. But despite the brilliance of the gesture and the male charisma he naturally exuded in that particular film he seemed rather lifeless to me bored by the whole gossipy environment I can't blame him and only there to recite his lines to create a false impression of chemistry with Tracy. I couldn't stand his constant grin but not as much as Hepburn's trademark 'Bryn Mawr accent thanks IMDb that got quickly on my nerves this 'yawr' 'dahling' or this expression as if she wanted us to check if she had salad stuck in her teeth. But don't take my iconoclasm very seriously I'm an unexceptional reviewer. In fact I'm so mediocre compared to these icons I dare to criticize that I even rooted for John Howard's character as George Kettridge the target of a whole conspiracy from the director the writer and the actors. They spared no efforts to mock and belittle George he was a hypocrite an ambitious man but I have to see it to believe it after all neither Grant or Connor had better intentions and George seemed a rather decent man. Anyway they were all so meanspirited than my immediate reaction was to take his side. At least in usual screwball comedies it's one rival against another here the guy has no chance standing against the two men and his own fianc plotting against him. And watching the beautiful Tracy Lord swinging back and forth from Connor to Morgan like a tennis ball was embarrassing not to mention the ludicrous ending. Marry me Tracy she's reluctant because it wouldn't please his girlfriend photographer Liz Ruth Hussey. Naturally Liz doesn't mind being used as a Plan B nor does Tracy to get back to her precedent husband. Damn I'm almost glad Georgie got himself out of this mess. The film had its moments though I liked the part where Stewart pretended to be drunk and you could see at one moment that both him and Grant were trying not to laugh that was my favorite moment of the film it was genuine charming and innocent and it allowed us to forget about the intricacy of the plot.Speaking of that 'drunk' scene I'm not sure either that Stewart deserved the Oscar I know it was a compensation for his loss in 1939 but seriously was he better than Henry Fonda in Grapes of Wrath or even as a comedic performance was he better than Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator? I could concede anything to the movie maybe if I watched it a third or fourth time I will end up believing it's a masterpiece but I don't think I would praise Stewart's performance I didn't even think it was worthy of a nomination. The writing also won an Oscar but then again it's adapted from a play it has the kind of prefabricated wit that was overexploited in screwball classics but for some reason I don't think these kinds of artificial exchange fit the silver screen.Maybe it's the whole vaudeville thing but I grew rapidly tired of these dialogs where you get the feeling that each character is trying to outsmart the other and naturally George is the biggest target he receives them and seems incapable to say one word or two to Grant or Stewart. From funny it gets incredibly redundant and ruins the poignancy or the intelligent lucidity some scenes genuinely provides. Granted it's not meant to be realistic and people have to be entertained but at one point it's just words words words or like would say Hepburn wohds wohds wohds. And I guess I've seen enough classics not to feel guilty about this one.And please don't get me started on the socalled feminist undertones just because Hepburn plays a very strong and outspoken character. If one thing the film proves and quite realistically that a woman can be as strong as bossy as a bully as a man IF she's rich. It attacks the core of feminism which is the perpetual antagonism between men and women by showing that it's only a matter of rich vs. poor. It's funny how the film works better as a social commentary and it's only by realizing that she wouldn't live with a man who'd prevent her from freedom by letting her drink and loosen up that Tracy goes with the rich guy of course only rich can afford to be decadent. There goes George sings Grant to ridicule him just ignore them George you're the unsung hero of The Philadelphia Story".

Of course the results of all this is hilarious.Stewart and Hussey give ground breaking performances as the reporters. Besides this winning best picture Jimmy Stewart won a well deserved Oscar for best actor in his role. Of course a great comedy would not be complete without the beautiful charming hilarious Katherine Hepburn who never fails to impress. Gave yet another fantastic and unforgettable performance.Films like this aren't made nearly as well or even made anymore. All the more reason to treasure these wonderful works of art and history. Gerg Cukor does a fine and memorable job in directing but it's the acting and one of films finest screenplays that blows this film way ahead of most romantic comedies. It was originally a play by Philip Barry and turned into one of the greatest screenplays heard on the silver screen. The screenplay was done by the masterful Donald Stewart.

Maybe I was in the wrong frame of mind and need to see it again but I just didn't find it very funny and more often than not just thought it boring and dragging on too long.Cary Grant is alright but this is not his best role. Katherine Hepburn is a hideously ugly beast an annoying leading woman and her mouth belches out lines with a voice that would kill anything within earshot. How she is considered one of Hollywood's biggest star in this or any era is beyond me. Jimmy Stewart plays the redeeming character in this one and it helps that at times he comes across as a rambling drunk. His drunkness is not as great as Doc Boone's from Stagecoach but still notable.The actress who plays Dinah Lord Virginia Weidler is the hidden gem here. She appeared in 44 films over the course of her lifetime but probably none you've ever seen besides this one. I'm not sure how she managed to be in so many films but almost never in any successful ones. Whether that's her fault or that the casting director never picked her for the right roles I don't know.Until I see this one again which i don't plan on being soon I'll have to say it didn't thrill me and the only really lasting legacy of this movie is that Tracy Lord became the namesake of one of the world's most notorious porn stars.

	schema:headline " A turning point in Katharine Hepburn's career...";
	schema:reviewBody "... and IMHO just about a perfect romantic comedy. C.K.Dexter Haven Cary Grant had a short stormy marriage to Tracy Lord Hepburn. Now she is about to marry George Kittredge John Howard. Haven and Lord are old money elite. Kittredge is a guy who pulled himself up by his bootstraps...and he won't let anybody forget it. You never really know WHY Dexter agrees to help infiltrate and therefore sabotage Tracy's second marriage. You never know if he intended to try and get her back from the opening scene it seems their parting was pretty acrimonious. Or maybe he just knew that Kittredge was a drip and didn't want Tracy to suffer a lifetime of..well..being dripped on. At any rate he convinces the Lords into allowing two reporters from Spy Magazine to cover her wedding because the magazine publisher has a story all ready to go about Tracy's father's affair with a chorus girl if that coverage is not allowed. Since Haven although he doesn't need the salary works for the magazine too this allows him to get back into the Lord household and do his best to ruffle Tracy's feathers. Tracy's problem and the reason that her first marriage broke up was her inability to see her own moral weaknesses while pointing out everybody else's. Tracy is completely to the manor born. When she discovers that one of the reporters James Stewart as Macauley Conner has written a beautiful book of poetry she asks him why he works for a cheap tabloid magazine instead of writing his own material. His reply is that he has to eat and this answer rather stumps her. There are many complicating factors. Tracy's dad is off with his mistress so the Lords try to pass their uncle Wllly off as Mr. Lord to the reporters. When Tracy's dad returns unexpectedly they try to pass him off as uncle Willy. The two reporters Stewart and Ruth Hussey have some kind of low key romantic understanding but then Macauley begins to become attracted to Tracy. Add alcohol and almost code busting complications and insinuations ensue.It really holds up today as a genuine romantic comedy and comedy of manners in which everybody displays authentic behavior and reactions in spite of that pesky production code. The only thing archaic and even somewhat repulsive is how Tracy's father tries to make his affair with the chorus girl all Tracy's fault. He tells her that when a man has a daughter that loves him in spite of his faults he doesn't go looking for that in his golden years in another woman. I wonder if Chelsea Clinton ever had these problems? But I digress.Let me just say one thing about James Stewart's Best Actor Oscar. Stewart was wonderful as a working man captivated by a woman from another world who discovers that the rich are not all jerks but he was definitely not the lead. This was Grant and Hepburn's picture all of the way. The only thing I can figure is that the Academy felt that they did Stewart wrong the previous year by passing him over in Mr. Smith Goes To Washington and were making amends.I highly recommend this to anyone. If you are not into classic film and would like to be this is a perfect place to start.".

Remember this film debuted in 1940  only a year after the publication of Alcoholics Anonymous. So perhaps we can forgive Dexter for blaming his drinking problem on Tracy and forgive Tracy for accepting the blame.I have a harder time forgiving Seth Lord for blaming his infidelity on Tracy's lack of warmth. What a load of crap! Even if he was influenced by her coldness what's wrong with Dinah's love? In the end a spouse cheats because heshe wants to.I've watched this movie enough times to tell you everything that's wrong with it  politically morally in terms of continuity and so on. And I'll keep watching it because the great dialog and awesome performances make it worth it every time!".

	schema:reviewBody "THE PHILADELPHIA STORY is a great comedy directed by George Cukor. Despite the fact that the thematic framework already narrated and seen earlier this movie seems fresh. I think in this film everyone can find something for themselves. Humor is a varied and meaningful. See Grant Hepburn and Stewart in the same film is quite challenging. The script is very good and is followed by an even better acting. The Philadelphia Story is the story of luxury and elegance teasing sarcasm love drinking arrogance and generally a wide range of human qualities. The cellophane high society are seamlessly wrapped diversity that makes us who we are.Three men and three different characters are linked each in its own way with the rich ice queen Tracy Lord Katharine Hepburn. C.K. Dextera Havena Cary Grant is profound eloquent and charming exhusband. This character is a bit neglected but always in the right place and pronounce the keywords at the right time. Grant is excellent but I was a bit bored with the roles of exhusbands. Macaulay Connor James Stewart is forever unhappy writer who immigrated to write the yellow press. The voice of criticism and the voice of reason. The character who has something to say to everyone except himself. George Kittredge John Howard He was betrothed young rich and untouchable upstart who answer its her standards.Cukor with the help of the aforementioned scenarios exported tangle heated smart and wiggly dialogue spiced with romantic intrigue which no lack of questions. Antagonisms and friendship between the characters is another of the features that contribute to such receptivity of the film which are equally contributed by all.Stewart and Grant are the face and did a great job. However my sympathies were given ladies. Hepburn is in her crazy performance authentic of forcing a prude who does not forgive until the fine souls who want love and violations of their own unnecessary rules and countless prejudices. Ruth Hussey as Elizabeth Imbrie is paparazzo and wouldbe painter. She offered a lot of sarcasm beneath which hides their romantic thoughts. Always responds readily to prevent the drawer own feelings.An honest romantic funny and extremely sophisticated comedy who on my own joy is not a failure.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Philadelphia Story is a brilliant rom com. It's smart funny emotional romantic and so much more. Much of this comes from its brilliant screenplay its Oscar win was well deserved and the actors who make it come to life. The story is a creative twist on classic tropes for example rather than a love triangle it has an odd love polygon featuring three potential suitors competing for Katharine Hepburn's Tracy Lord and a subtriangle surrounding James Stewart's Macaulay Connors the dialogue is clever and witty and the humor works extremely well. It is a wild fastpaced joyride of a film but it manages to never get the audience lost along the way even through multiple faked identities and misunderstandings among the characters.  Much of the credit for the success of The Philadelphia Story goes to the actors. Its central figures are played Katharine Hepburn James Stewart and Cary Grant all undeniable titans of filmmaking. The manic pacing of the film presents a challenge to these actors as they need to be over the top to meet the demands of the script but going too far makes the film hokey and unbelieveable. Luckily the film delivers on the promise of its billing with each of the three leads delivering a stellar performance. The film is also stocked with scene stealing supporting players such as Ruth Hussey Roland Young and Virginia Weidler each one adding to the merits of an already excellent film. The Philadelphia Story fits into a number of subgenres. While it is most associated the remarriage subgenre in which a divorced couple rediscovers love much to the chagrin of their current romantic partners ex. His Girl Friday but it also fits into the wedding subgenre in which one of the romantic leads is about to get married to another person and the other lead has to break up the wedding ex. The Wedding Singer Made of Honor and the journalism subgenre in which one of the romantic leads is tasked with writing a story about the other and in doing so falls in love ex. It Happened One Night 27 Dresses. Ultimately this subgenre transcendence reflects one of the more fascinating traits of The Philadelphia Story it is a combination of a number of classic romcom themes. It explores the relationship between social class and romance definitions of manhood and masculinity the validity of marriage and female sexual agency to name a few. Dealing with so many issues often could dilute each of them however the confused and manic nature of the film makes this compounded exploration of issues successful. The hectic pace implies that all of these anxieties coming up at once is in itself an anxiety unto itself. To the extent that The Philadelphia Story doesn't get the attention it deserves it can only be attributed to the fact that it is often overshadowed by its central player's other output. Each of the three leads was incredibly successful both before and after The Philadelphia Story collectively appearing in films such on the level of Bringing up Baby His Girl Friday Mr. Smith Goes to Washington It's a Wonderful Life Vertigo North by Northwest and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner to only name films from the top of my head. However The Philadelphia Story is a phenomenal achievement and not one to be missed.".

	schema:headline " Fantastic";
	schema:reviewBody "What a delightful movie this is  loaded with star power clever dialog and a script that keeps us guessing. The first scene where Cary Grant is shown leaving his wife Katharine Hepburn with no words spoken sets the tone. As Hepburn plans to remarry Grant seeks to get revenge on her by sneaking a reporter Jimmy Stewart and photographer Ruth Hussey into her home on the wedding weekend. Stewart is brilliant in the role from beginning to end. He's upset over being there in the first place as he's a serious writer who has been asked to write a trashy tabloid story and he's not a big fan of the welltodo either. The scene early on where he examines the silver thinking he's alone and is confronted by the butler is hilarious. Later he dials up another room within the home at random and says This is the bridal suite would you send up a couple of caviar sandwiches and a bottle of beer? When asked who he is he then says This is the voice of Doom calling. Your days are numbered 'til the seventh son of the seventh son before hanging up. He has other comic scenes early on including asking the librarian Dost thou have a washroom? after sensing her formality.I just loved how the film wrong foots us as we expect it to go in a direction of these two being undercover spies with all sorts of similar antics throughout the weekend. Instead Hepburn immediately sees through the ruse and proceeds to hilariously torture the pair with questions of her own. Along the way an uncle will be assigned the identity of the father only to have the father show up unexpectedly himself. Hepburn's much younger little sister Virginia Weidler is part of the fun at one point going up to the piano with a gleam in her eye and busting out a raucous tune Lydia oh Lydia say have you met Lydia? Oh Lydia the tattooed lady. She has eyes that folks adore so and a torso even more so...Throughout all this madcap chaos the script is fastpaced and clever. For example in response to her mother asking if there's no privacy anymore Hepburn quips Only in bed mother and not always there. I also loved it when she referred to the poet Li Bai at one point There was a Chinese poet who was drowned while trying to kiss the moon in the river. He was drunk....but he wrote beautiful poetry. More importantly there are observations on character and love. The father John Halliday tries to explain an older man's attraction to a younger woman and even though he seems like a rake there's something to what he says. The film takes a serious turn when he and Grant both say some devastating things to Hepburn about her insensitivity and the hurt in her reaction shows her acting prowess. With all of that said I think it was really Jimmy Stewart who really made this movie special with two wonderful scenes. The first is where he's drunk and goes over to Grant's place which is an absolute classic. The scene was unrehearsed what we see was the first take and it includes a couple of improvisations  Stewart hiccupping and Grant quipping Excuse me. The look in Stewart's eyes really make us feel that he's drunk and that we're getting a glimpse at two friends the actors themselves having fun. In fact the way Stewart looks at people throughout the movie  the butler the librarian Grant and Hepburn  is just fantastic and still makes me smile thinking about it.The second amazing scene is when he and Hepburn who's also drunk realize they're in love. A magnificence that comes out of your eyes in your voice in the way you stand there in the way you walk. You're lit from within Tracy. You've got fires banked down in you hearthfires and holocausts he says. She answers I don't seem to you made of bronze? a reference to one of the cruel things that's been said to her and he responds No you're made out of flesh and blood. That's the blank unholy surprise of it. You're the golden girl Tracy. Full of life and warmth and delight.... When he kisses her she emits a beautiful golly and later before they dash off across the lawn she says put me in your pocket Mike. It's a wonderful romantic scene. Oh and I should say the lines they say to each other earlier in the evening  Hello you... You look fine I feel fine are just lovely too. It's for that reason that I have to say I was a bit disappointed in Hepburn's choice at the end. The evening before she does say The time to make up your mind about people is never and it is in the spirit of a reconciliation which grows but just doesn't feel right. Aside from her feeling the blame for her exhusband's alcoholism the nerve of her not understanding him better! the real passion and chemistry is with Stewart. With that said though it's a delightful movie and the story behind its making and Katharine Hepburn's resurrection is a real testament to her intelligence.".

In fact the way Stewart looks at people throughout the movie  the butler the librarian Grant and Hepburn  is just fantastic and still makes me smile thinking about it.The second amazing scene is when he and Hepburn who's also drunk realize they're in love. A magnificence that comes out of your eyes in your voice in the way you stand there in the way you walk. You're lit from within Tracy. You've got fires banked down in you hearthfires and holocausts he says. She answers I don't seem to you made of bronze? a reference to one of the cruel things that's been said to her and he responds No you're made out of flesh and blood. That's the blank unholy surprise of it. You're the golden girl Tracy. Full of life and warmth and delight.... When he kisses her she emits a beautiful golly and later before they dash off across the lawn she says put me in your pocket Mike. It's a wonderful romantic scene. Oh and I should say the lines they say to each other earlier in the evening  Hello you... You look fine I feel fine are just lovely too. It's for that reason that I have to say I was a bit disappointed in Hepburn's choice at the end. The evening before she does say The time to make up your mind about people is never and it is in the spirit of a reconciliation which grows but just doesn't feel right. Aside from her feeling the blame for her exhusband's alcoholism the nerve of her not understanding him better! the real passion and chemistry is with Stewart. With that said though it's a delightful movie and the story behind its making and Katharine Hepburn's resurrection is a real testament to her intelligence.";

That seems to be the case of this John Sturges' 1955 film Underwater! in which the curvaceous Jane Russell starred for the last time for Howard Hughes.The film is a curious one. We are introduced to Johnny and Dominic two underwater divers who are searching for those sunken ships in the Caribbean especially this one not too far from Cuba. As they stumble into the old Spanish galleon they find a man that appears to be a sort of pirate awaiting for them because it's obvious they are after those treasures.As Johnny and Dominic go back to Cuba we are introduced to Theresa Johnny's wife who is dead set against spending money chasing his dreams. But when Dominic meets Gloria by chance she tells him about the yacht she has been left with by a departing old flame. So the four friends and a priest who knows about those sunk ships go in search of the riches trapped underwater.The film doesn't bring anything new to this film genre. In fact it's pretty tame stuff we see in a predictable story we know how it will end. The best reward for the viewers of Underwater is the beautiful Jane Russell at her best. She was one of the sultriest women working in films during those days. The problem is the male stars who give by the numbers performances. Joseph Calleia is the only one that shows any spunk as the man who wants the riches from under the sea.".

	schema:reviewBody "Underwater was allegedly set in Cuba but actually photographed on the Kona Coast of Hawaii was the last time that Jane Russell worked for Howard Hughes. The mysterious industrialist would shortly be getting rid of RKO Studios and RKO itself would shortly go Underwater after that.The site of Jane Russell even in a conservative one piece bathing suit was enough to delight the male members of the audience with those twin weapons of mass destruction Jane sported.

It's then that Lady Luck struck him and Dom when looking to rent a 50 foot boat from this guy Robinson they finds that he checked out of town and left his boat over to his totally landlocked minded young secretary Gloria Lori Nelson who's more then willing to let the two treasure hunters use it.There's a number of unexpected event happen to the quintet with a local padre Father Cannon Robert Keith coming on board who's only interested in recovering a life size solid gold Virgin Mary statue studded with diamonds to be returned to her rightful owners in the little church in Panama where she originally came from. Later there's this boatload of shark hunters headed by the scuzzylooking Rico Joseph Caileialooking for garbage from John's boat to use as bait to attract the underwater predators. Rico smells a rat or a gold bar when John tells him he and Dom are only looking for underwater rocks to be studied by the professors and students at Havana University.The movie Underwater comes to it's very predictable conclusion when after reaching the underwater sunken treasure site Johnny is left by himself with Dom suffering from the bends. It's then when we finally get to see Theresa or actress Jane Russell who we earlier briefly saw in a swimsuit put on her bathing suit and dive underwater to help and possible save her husband Johnny from either drowning or getting eaten up by sharks. Theresa for all her efforts gets stuck in the sunken ships wreckage where we then have Johnny making it back to the boat to get her an extra oxygen tank. You wonder why all this was really necessary when Theresa has those two giant natural air supply tanks that can easily keep Theresa breathing for at least a week! With Johnny and Theresa as well as Dom who heroically came to both their aid risking his life doing it back on the boat their again confronted by the sharkhunters who were disarmed and left on shore by Johnny  Dom just a while earlier. We then have another boring battle between them and Johnny  Dom which ends with everybody shaking hands and becoming friends This happens when one of the shark hunters got very religious which quickly affected the rest of his crewmates over the the fact that all this violence was over a golden statue of the Virgin Mary the mother of the Prince of Peace!Nothing that you wouldn't expect or want in a movie like Underwater except hoping to see a lot more of Jane Russell in a tight swimsuit with a happy ending without anyone in the film getting killed.

So much for the film history because the video version I saw was in 1.331 format leaving a lot of the visual underwater spectaculars out of the picture. Not that it might have helped much the otherwise lackluster presentation. The underwater photography of scavenging a sunken treasure does look great and very well done for its time. But above the surface there are the all too static scenes made in a studio with painted skies and wind machines. The dialog and acting are stiff and more like posing instead of running smoothly along the story. Not that the plot is much of a help either. A bit more care for the script would have been needed for a working balance next to the well executed underwater scenes and such ambitious plans for marketing tricks like underwater screenings with aqualungs for the press. The whole story is very slow moving and largely without excitement until the final fifteen minutes. Only then is the movie finally able to fill some of the expectations that have been promised all along with claustrophobic mood shark danger and Jane Russell stuck in a favorable position in open red swimming suit. John Sturges was usually a very capable director but this time his skills have probably been too tied under the command of the producer Howard Hughes. I'm sure they didn't really mean the whole movie to sink like that.".

Wild are impressively still able to set sail for an enjoyable Adventure. Taking place a good amount of time under waterSturges and Wild give the scuba diving an impressive crisp atmospherewhere smooth side shots allow the viewer to clearly see the cast underwater and also to spot the shiny treasure in the underwater world.";

	schema:reviewBody "Here's a rare chance to see Jane Russell give a truly ridiculous performance as a sultry Latina with an unconvincing Spanish accent. She is married to deep sea diver Richard Egan who along with older Latin lothario Gilbert Roland wants to go down to the depths to collect the gold from a sunken ship in the Caribbean. Russell fills her performance with fury but she's not at all believable in her part where was Abbe Lane? so her presence becomes a distraction from the often dully plotted adventure yarn. The film opens on a fantastic note with the credits set underwater rolling over a very classical sounding version of Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White which Cuban bandleader Perez Prado made very popular in a mambo recording that has stood the test of time. The Prado version appears several times in the film once with Prado and his band playing it in a cafe sequence and another rather sultry sequence where Egan chases a playful Russell on the beach of the island that they along with Roland and his younger girlfriend Lori Nelson have a picnic on.There's the typical danger with both the risks of diving in these rocky waters and going into the hull of a much damaged ship that could collapse in on the divers at any minute and crew members who may have nefarious plans of their own. The film is narrated by the third billed Egan who is really the lead and at one point I had a chuckle over his line Capital is the least of my worries considering that his last acting job was as the wealthy patriarch Sam Clegg on the daytime soap opera Capitol. Technically this film is extremely well done with the photography breathtaking and almost 3D in nature but script wise it often becomes boring when the actors or stuntmen are not diving down to the depths to retrieve the gold and other treasures they find. I've been searching for this film for years ever since first seeing it when it came out on VHS in the early 1990's and while the second trip underwater was a slight disappointment I did find many things in it to enjoy. If only director John Sturges had gotten Russell some lessons in a proper Spanish accent where she didn't sound like a female version of Speedy Gonzalez!".

I suppose that once you graduated from Beach Blanket Bingo and started drinking rum and coke instead of Soda Pop Ricky's you started watching films such as this. More of a travelogue for snow bound Midwesterners in Detroit and Minot it shows a lot of tropical settings and Jane Russell.PROS AND CONS This isn't a great film but it is an interesting window into the past. The primary reason for watching is Jane Russell. One of those actresses that could ooze a lot of sex appeal without taking off a lot of clothes. She captures the audience in any scene she is in. Richard Egan as her husband is one of those 1950s stereotype leading men chiseled jaw deep voice good looking rugged probably gay. American virtue is on full display in this film. Love honor sharing fairness and no heavy plot twists or dark secrets. Everything is pretty much superficial.By today's standards this isn't good film making. Whenever there is a real change there is noticeable fading at the ends and beginning of the reels bad film to digital transfer?. Often times there are tint or lighting changes in the same scene when there is an edit. I loved the yacht that serves as their base for scuba diving in the film. On the outside it is a small slope that could probably sleep four adults. But the interior shots of the boat show it to be as big as the Queen Mary with 10 foot high ceilings. There is a lot of travelogue footage of sailboats at sunset and underwater scenes with bubbles and sharks which take up about 14 of the film. An obligatory dance scene in a dance bar with a smokin hot Latin band. All the usual stuff to make the folks in Peoria wish they were somewhere else in November 1958. An interesting look back to a simpler time when things weren't to complex.".

	schema:headline " What Gold Can Do to Men's Souls";
	schema:reviewBody "Johnny Gray his wife Teresa his friend Dominic Quesada and Dominic's girlfriend Gloria who just happens to own a boat are on a diving expedition off the coast of Cuba searching for sunken treasure. Teresa is supposed to be Cuban and some of her dialogue is in Spanish but Jane Russell does not attempt a foreign accent in her Englishlanguage dialogue. In particular they have dreams of finding a 17th century ship containing a life size solid gold Madonna with precious jewels. They realise however that even after they have found the wreck they will have to face many perils before they can recover the treasure. They also discover that they face competition from a group of local shark fisherman who are suspicious about their activities and who refuse to be fobbed off with their story that they are merely geologists collecting samples. The film was directed by John Sturges a director whose work could vary in quality but who at his best was responsible for some of the great classics of the fifties and sixties such as Bad Day at Black Rock Gunfight at the OK Corral and The Great Escape. Underwater! is not really in the same class as any of those great films. One of its main weaknesses is the casting of Richard Egan a rather stiff actor more notable for his impressive physique than for his acting talents in the leading role of Johnny. As Johnny is a complex character not a mere action hero the film would have been better with a stronger actor in this part. The rest of the cast are rather better although I suspect that a lot of the film's appeal at least for male viewers was the chance to see Jane Russell showing off her own equally impressive physique in a swimsuit. Overall however Underwater! holds up pretty well today. On one level it is an exciting adventure story in which the treasurehunters have to battle sharks moray eels and other underwater dangers. In this respect it is far superior to something like The Deep which attempted to tell a roughly similar story some two decades later. A film shot underwater must have been something new and original in 1955 these scenes were not actually shot under the sea but in a specially constructed tank. On another level however it is a parable along the lines of Treasure of the Sierra Madre about what gold can do to men's souls although it does not have quite the dramatic power of John Huston's masterpiece and lacks its tragic ending. Johnny becomes obsessed with the quest for the statue to such an extent that he is quite prepared to sacrifice his own life or the lives of his companions to find it. In the conflict with the fishermen it is Johnny who is the aggressor. It is notable that the cast includes a Catholic priest who acts as a sort of moral compass for the rest. These two layers of meaning help to keep the film watchable nearly sixty years after it was made. A bonus is the attractive musical score based around the popular hit tune Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White. 610".

There are prejudices much worse even now  I was amazed that one person actually compared this wonderful film to Crash give the world a break!! If Crash...Ugh!...proved anything is was to reassure EVERYONE racism is still America's cancer.I am from Biloxi Mississippi  along the Gulf Coast.

Mathew Mc was astounding and Sandra Bullock's performance was exactly as it should have been as an activist little rich girl Southern gave a true performance of a alcoholic lawyer Sam Jackson was masterful and expressed the difference in being white and black Kevin Stacy's portrayal of a Southern lawyer with all the connections right on I can think of no one who wasn't brilliantly cast.Missed by many people who made comments this film is a statement that today we are brutally MEAN to one another Crash restates this fact although it is not nearly as poetic. Do I own this film? You betcha!! I'll most likely have to buy another and it will be money wellspent. Grishom knows how to get our attention and A Time to Kill clearly demonstrates all who were involved in its making were determined to keep his story pure.

	schema:reviewBody "Courtroom dramas are well known for providing thrilling films and that is exactly what 'A Time to Kill' thrives on entertainment value. It is clear that the film in spite of having some very potent themes puts most of it's focus on being entertaining and it's actually not a bad film for it. Sometimes films that want to be entertaining and have themes fall down because they're too entertaining and the themes get left by the wayside but A Time to Kill puts its cards on the table from the start and it's always clear what this film wants to do with itself. The plot follows a man who after his daughter is raped and almost murdered decides to take the law into his own hands. However this man is also a black man living in a white supremacy state and so the film injects a racism theme into it's plot which is always going to mean that it will have some sort of social commentary within it. However that isn't the most interesting comment that the film wants to make as that plaudit falls to the idea of justice and exactly what justice is.The film based on a novel by crime writer John Grisham presents an impossible situation to the viewer and central characters what do you do when justice will prevail whatever the verdict? The viewer and the characters must then make a choice between the law and general morality and it is there where the film draws it's most interesting plot point from. While as mentioned it's always clear that this movie is meant to entertain you it's always nice to be given something to think about as well. A Time to Kill benefits immensely from an absolutely fabulous cast which includes the likes of Samuel L. Jackson Sandra Bullock Kevin Spacey Kiefer Sutherland his father Donald Sutherland Ashley Judd Chris Cooper and more all of which are lead by Matthew McConaughey. It is the lead that most lets the film down as although McConaughey can definitely act he's not quite charismatic enough to deliver a lead performance in front of that cast. Still the movie is definitely very decent and although you probably wont hurt your brain watching it it will entertain you.".

	schema:headline " Glossy legal thriller with a rotten core";
	schema:reviewBody "A Time To Kill is based on the John Grisham novel  in Mississippi two drunken rednecks brutally rape and attempt to murder a young black girl. Her father Carl Lee Hailey Samuel L. Jackson in his grief and anger shoots both men as they enter the courthouse for their pretrial hearing and faces a trial that could lead to his execution if he is found guilty of their murder. An ambitious young lawyer Jake Tyler Brigance Matthew McConaughey takes on his defence no matter what the cost to his family and friends who are under threat from the Klu Klux Klan.The problem with the central premise is that Carl Lee Hailey guns down the two men before their trial so we don't know for certain they are going to get away with their terrible crime  and with the evidence against them it would be a racist jury indeed who found them innocent. This takes away a lot of the empathy for his plight as he clearly premeditates the killing and he is prepared to leave his family destitute if he receives life imprisonment or the death penalty. The only defence really offered is that it is racist to consider his actions unjustified even though he manages to badly wound a police officer leading to the amputation of his leg  clearly an accident but firing guns in crowded rooms is bound to cause that kind of mishap. The direction and editing do not help with pointless scenes such as those that set to prove that Lee Hailey killed the men  a fact that wasn't in doubt. The handling of the whole racism issue is clumsily handled as we are frequently told that the area is racist and yet they elected a black sheriff.Brigance is hardly a sympathetic character either spending the evening before the start of the biggest trial of his career getting drunk and flirting with one of his helpers while his wife is out of town. The cast of the film is hard to fault with even minor roles portrayed by famous artists such as Sandra Bullock Kevin Spacey Donald and Kiefer Sutherland and Patrick McGoohan. This tends to be a distraction as very few of the supporting cast have much to do. There is a strong script and fine acting all round though McConaughey in his breakthrough role is somewhat overshadowed by the rest of the starry cast. The script is strong in particular the closing speech of the trial is very powerful as it describes in greater detail the full horror of the actions of the murdered men. However the script in the main is heavily biased towards a very specific agenda and is highly manipulative.Overall the film left a bad taste in my mouth when the credits rolled as the message it seemed to be delivering was that it is okay to be a vigilante and anyone who thinks Lee Hailey deserved punishment for his actions is a racist. While I felt sorry for him and did not think he deserved the death penalty allowing him to get away scotfree was going too far in my opinion. Not having read the novel I am unable to say where exactly the fault lies but the cast despite their best efforts are unable to raise the material beyond its limitations.".

The 90s weren't as polite as the late 50s early 60s when we were riveted by To Kill a Mockingbird a book and film that author John Grisham credits as an influence to this story. Two Good Ol Boy racists go on a redneck spree disrespecting all things Black...men women and children. Their beer guzzling binge culminates in the rape and near murder of a 10 year old black girl. Samuel L Jackson plays her father...and he goes out for revenge killing the two miscreants and seriously wounding a deputy sheriff in the process. The film thereafter revolves around the very basic points  A. Can a Black man receive a fair trial even in the socalled New South after killing two white men...even though their crime was and is considered reprehensible by every decent human being? And B Will the Black man receive competent legal representation and receive justice irrespective of his vigilante action which appears to many to be justified? What will be the fallout? Matt McConaughey's performance as the lawyer is slightly reminiscent of Gregory Peck in Mockingbird. He has a moralistic reverence for the law and endures the taunts of the townsfolk and his other encumbrances with fortitude. Sandra Bullock is convincing as the law student who wants to chime in and lend a hand for the experience. Don and Keifer Sutherland deliver solid support...the elder being a disbarred lawyer who is ready with advice the younger playing a racist Klansman out to get revenge for the two dead rednecks. The atmosphere hinges on the explosive as the racial tension builds and it is a movie that is worth watching with a message worth pondering and remembering. See the film.".

Sandra Bullock is convincing as the law student who wants to chime in and lend a hand for the experience. Don and Keifer Sutherland deliver solid support...the elder being a disbarred lawyer who is ready with advice the younger playing a racist Klansman out to get revenge for the two dead rednecks. The atmosphere hinges on the explosive as the racial tension builds and it is a movie that is worth watching with a message worth pondering and remembering. See the film.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are other reviews here expressing similar views but I still feel impelled to add my comments. The film is generally wellmade from a technical point of view apart from possibly being too long. The acting is mostly very good although Kevin Spacey isn't given much space to explain his character's motivation apparently ambition rather than racism and Sandra Bullock's only function seems to be as eye candy which she admittedly manages very well.At a fundamental level the film's heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism and I get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it. However it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew I haven't read the book so I don't know how much of that is down to Grisham. The biggest problem as many others have said is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice. Aside from the fact that I don't agree with that position I don't think that such a view actually helps the antiracist cause at all  it's more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims. At the end the prosecutor invites the jury and the audience to imagine that the raped girl was white  but follow that through and imagine the defendant to be a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end the message seems to be that it's OK to kill someone as long as you hate them enough. It's also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real case.Samuel L Jackson gives an excellent performance but unfortunately this also undermines the plot  he comes across as someone with considerable integrity but it's hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity plea and indeed he doesn't when push comes to shove. We're presumably supposed to think that it's because he faces the death penalty but in fact at one point he's offered a plea of manslaughter although if you blink you might miss it. Why not take it given that he must know his chances of acquittal are slim? Or if he wants to make a stand in court why plead insanity?There are less serious flaws too. The medical experts on whose testimony the case supposedly rests are jokes  both are discredited for highly implausible reasons and neither of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever they're asked to say and shouldn't be believed. The fact that the injured policeman supports Jackson is moderately plausible but still a bit convenient and what if he had died? I find it hard to believe that the KKK would march down the street in broad daylight. Other apparently serious crimes riot arson kidnapping attempted murder go by without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. And the scene where the dog comes bounding back is ludicrous.My final reaction is to be left feeling rather dirty  as though I must be a racist because I disagree with the resolution. It may be that the film intended to explore different viewpoints and leave the audience to decide but if so they seem to have forgotten it by the time they got to the end. The film did make me think about my views read what other people thought here and add my own opinion so at some level maybe it succeeded  but I worry that it may have reinforced highly illiberal views in some people which I hope is the opposite of what it intended.Final thought  try watching Law and Order it covers issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!".

We have an underdog lawyer McConaughey battling the big bad system to save his client. And oh by the way the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi complete with hooded KKK men burning crosses.In other words we're supposed to sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. We're supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist allwhite jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime. We're supposed feel like we're standing alongside the people chanting Free Carl Lee.But the racism issue is a smokescreen and the whole thing is contrived. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante.

This would have been true no matter what his skin colour or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter the judge the jury or anyone else.And what's so heavyhanded about this film is that it paints anyone who believes Carl Lee should have been convicted is a racist.

	schema:headline " A socially irresponsible film2 out of 4 stars.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have not read A Time to Kill by John Grisham and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better. But perhaps not. I hear this is the most faithful Grisham adaption yet and if that is true I can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when Grisham introduced it as his first work.A Time to Kill is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. It wants to be a suspenseful crowdpleasing thriller and at the same time a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions. Let's face it those two types of films do not go together in Hollywood which is why Dead Man Walking had to be made independently.The story involves a young lawyer named Jake Matthew McConaughy out to defend a black man named Carl Samuel L. Jackson from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter. The day before the rapists' trial Carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building he charged out and shot both of them dead. To help out with the defense Jack accepts the help of a former law student Sandra Bullock who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary and put in the film only for marketing purposes.Meanwhile one of the rapist's kid brother Kiefer Sutherland was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge. All of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse a kidnapping a brutal beating and race riot.  I'll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film in addition to the courtroom scenes. What I later objected to was the film's handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot.The main question that the film constantly asks over and over again is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. Sure they can but that doesn't mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair. This film however doesn't seem to think so. Besides that there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences. For example there is an unknown character called Mickey Mouse who is a member of the Klan and for reasons unknown is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the Klan. After Bullock is kidnapped by Sutherland and company and left for dead in the wilderness this unknown person comes and saves herand we NEVER find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing.And speaking of the Sutherland character's reign of terror it's amazing how witless the police and the Bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film. There's a scene when Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake as he comes out shooting one of the guards instead. Now you'd think since there are dozens of police around it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. No such luck. From what we could see no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose. Even after Bullock was rescued by Mickey Mouse she never ever mentioned who her kidnapper was nor was it even questioned. Why was this? Simple. The Sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense although logically he should have been out of the picture.Besides Bullock's character there another thankless character. He is Jake's assistant played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movieto supply a number of oneliners for the audience. In my opinion oneliners show a major weakness in serious films when used. It demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film.But enough of the film's many minor problems. What about the film's message here? It is clear that Carl is indeed guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. The lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity etc that caused him to kill. In desperation Jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement. After describing everything that took place he adds on one final line...The girl is white. We then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes.In the very next scene a girl comes out yelling He's free! He's free!. Wait a minute! Do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts? Most of all why weren't  there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off. I'll tell you why. They couldn't show the delibertion because NO JURY could acquit a man of such a crime no matter how much the defense's closing arguements touched their hearts. What is the message? That someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them?This film should have had the courage to say that murder is NOT OK in this situation because in reality there would not be an acquittal.

	onyx:emotionText "I have not read A Time to Kill by John Grisham and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better. But perhaps not. I hear this is the most faithful Grisham adaption yet and if that is true I can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when Grisham introduced it as his first work.A Time to Kill is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. It wants to be a suspenseful crowdpleasing thriller and at the same time a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions. Let's face it those two types of films do not go together in Hollywood which is why Dead Man Walking had to be made independently.The story involves a young lawyer named Jake Matthew McConaughy out to defend a black man named Carl Samuel L. Jackson from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter. The day before the rapists' trial Carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building he charged out and shot both of them dead. To help out with the defense Jack accepts the help of a former law student Sandra Bullock who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary and put in the film only for marketing purposes.Meanwhile one of the rapist's kid brother Kiefer Sutherland was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge. All of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse a kidnapping a brutal beating and race riot.  I'll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film in addition to the courtroom scenes. What I later objected to was the film's handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot.The main question that the film constantly asks over and over again is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. Sure they can but that doesn't mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair. This film however doesn't seem to think so. Besides that there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences. For example there is an unknown character called Mickey Mouse who is a member of the Klan and for reasons unknown is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the Klan. After Bullock is kidnapped by Sutherland and company and left for dead in the wilderness this unknown person comes and saves herand we NEVER find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing.And speaking of the Sutherland character's reign of terror it's amazing how witless the police and the Bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film. There's a scene when Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake as he comes out shooting one of the guards instead. Now you'd think since there are dozens of police around it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. No such luck. From what we could see no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose. Even after Bullock was rescued by Mickey Mouse she never ever mentioned who her kidnapper was nor was it even questioned. Why was this? Simple. The Sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense although logically he should have been out of the picture.Besides Bullock's character there another thankless character. He is Jake's assistant played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movieto supply a number of oneliners for the audience. In my opinion oneliners show a major weakness in serious films when used. It demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film.But enough of the film's many minor problems. What about the film's message here? It is clear that Carl is indeed guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. The lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity etc that caused him to kill. In desperation Jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement. After describing everything that took place he adds on one final line...The girl is white. We then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes.In the very next scene a girl comes out yelling He's free! He's free!. Wait a minute! Do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts? Most of all why weren't  there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off. I'll tell you why. They couldn't show the delibertion because NO JURY could acquit a man of such a crime no matter how much the defense's closing arguements touched their hearts. What is the message? That someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them?This film should have had the courage to say that murder is NOT OK in this situation because in reality there would not be an acquittal. But since dollars were at stake the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences' feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message. If people start killing as a form of revenge the makers of this film should be held responsible. What a socially irresponsible film this is!";

This kind of oversimplification doesn't really solve anyone's problems black or white. But liberal Hollywood has been employing this approach ever since TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. And it's not hard to see why. Because if racism is simply a matter of the poorest most ignorant whites committing open acts of violence then the rich whites who run the film industry and the legal profession and the media are inherently on the right side of the issue. And every other issue too.In the end it's not really about racial justice it's about class prejudice and liberal hypocrisy. And this is not just a southern problem.For example some years ago there was a deplorable racial murder in Bensonhurst an Italian section of Brooklyn. And famed liberal columnist Anna Quindlen who is half Italian wrote a very frosty column essentially dismissing the entire neighborhood the entire class as ignorant Goombahs who should all be in jail. Evidently when you go to college and move to Manhattan you become one of the good guys. And it doesn't matter whether you send your kids to exclusive private schools and associate only with affluent whites  at least you don't hunt black children from pickup trucks or club people with baseball bats.

	schema:headline " Repulsive and dangerous";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a truly repellent film and one that is all too representative of the deeply pernicious influence that John Grisham has wielded over cultural life in America. It attempts to paper over its rabidly rightwing approach to justice with the usual flabby softliberal posturings over race. Ironically however its racial attitudes are almost as objectionable as its unabashed endorsement of vigilante violence here patronising smugness is taken to new lows. This film is in the notsoproud Hollywood tradition of stories about heroic white men riding to the rescue of noble but ineffectual black men and seldom has this tradition been affirmed as explicitly as it is here. In the form of representatives of the N.A.A.C.P. black people do indeed offer their support to Jackson's character but this is rejected in favour of Matthew McConaughey's bland young lawyer. In place of the political clout and legal expertise the N.A.A.C.P. are able to supply Carl Lee Hailey Jackson instead sticks to the inexperienced idealism of the crusading Caucasian protagonist. Know your place black folks! Don't you know there's a dashing photogenic white hero in the building? Move along now and leave the rescuing to this poor man's Atticus Finch. Good white people do battle with bad white people and the only appropriate place for black people in all of this is at the sidelines looking stoical and dignified. Another point to make against this odious trash is that the assertion of the individual's right to seek violent retribution is not so different from the basic assumptions of the Ku Klux Klan the villains of the piece. But such subtleties are hardly the type of stuff that the likes of Grisham and Schumacher can be expected to trifle with. It beggars belief how the former can have had the audacity to accuse Oliver Stone of encouraging violence when that is precisely what this dangerous rubbish does. Films like 'A Time to Kill' which champion personal vengeance no matter how bloody contribute to the kind of political climate in which leading politicians can express sympathy with crazed loons who murder judges. Apart from its warped values the film is shoddily written lamely paced and atrociously acted with one of the worst collections of hammy 'Southern' accents ever assembled. The cinematography is nice.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a truly repellent film and one that is all too representative of the deeply pernicious influence that John Grisham has wielded over cultural life in America. It attempts to paper over its rabidly rightwing approach to justice with the usual flabby softliberal posturings over race. Ironically however its racial attitudes are almost as objectionable as its unabashed endorsement of vigilante violence here patronising smugness is taken to new lows. This film is in the notsoproud Hollywood tradition of stories about heroic white men riding to the rescue of noble but ineffectual black men and seldom has this tradition been affirmed as explicitly as it is here. In the form of representatives of the N.A.A.C.P. black people do indeed offer their support to Jackson's character but this is rejected in favour of Matthew McConaughey's bland young lawyer. In place of the political clout and legal expertise the N.A.A.C.P. are able to supply Carl Lee Hailey Jackson instead sticks to the inexperienced idealism of the crusading Caucasian protagonist. Know your place black folks! Don't you know there's a dashing photogenic white hero in the building? Move along now and leave the rescuing to this poor man's Atticus Finch. Good white people do battle with bad white people and the only appropriate place for black people in all of this is at the sidelines looking stoical and dignified. Another point to make against this odious trash is that the assertion of the individual's right to seek violent retribution is not so different from the basic assumptions of the Ku Klux Klan the villains of the piece. But such subtleties are hardly the type of stuff that the likes of Grisham and Schumacher can be expected to trifle with.

In a courtroom drama the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury.  This basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl.  I for one find this very insulting. As for the rest I found the acting reasonable with the exception of Sandra Bullock who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self doesn't really work in a courtroom drama but what's the point when the film's message is as poor as this one.  It tells you that vigilante justice is fine and accuses you of racism if you disagree.".

Someone who always has a plan someone who made loafing off an art form someone who could fall in a barrel of youknowwhat and come out smelling like a rose?All he wants to do is take a day off from school and enjoy the day in Chicago  simple enough but he must also try and convince his best friend Cameron Ruck and his best girl Sara to join him and in the process learn to enjoy what life has to offer.Naturally there is a tyrannical school dean Jones who is determined to catch Ferris in the act of hookey and Ferris' own sister Grey prenose job who has it in for her brother the trousersnake. There are funny situations throughout the movie and the characters are ones that grow on you especially Ruck's worrywart portrayal of Cameron Frye constantly fretting about his dystalic cursing his father and nearly drowning in a pool all in the name of friendship.Sara has less to do but she plays the object of desire well and Ferris' passion for her is understandable. At least he thinks about the right things like what their lives would be like after high school.All the way from beginning to end this movie is a great trip in search of fun relaxation not taking life too seriously and how to sing Wayne Newton songs in the middle of a parade.

	schema:reviewBody "My friends knowing that I'm a huge film buff asked me to come up with a list of my favorite movies of all time when it came down to number one there was one film that stood out in my head that I knew I could watch over and over again and never get sick of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. One of the best comedies of all time Ferris Bueller is a movie that just stands the test of time. How anyone could not love this film is beyond any of my understanding Ferris Bueller is my hero among many others. John Hughes is usually remembered more for The Breakfast Club which is an incredible movie as well but I think this was his masterpiece. He said in an interview that this was his childhood getting his wife and best friend and skipping out on school to go down town and just have a good time. If you are a Chicago citizen you've pulled a Ferris Beuller's day off too it's like a law here lol if you haven't I pity you. The reason that this movie works is because of it's outrageous story that everyone wants to live Matthew Broderick there was no other choice he is who everyone wants to be Ferris Bueller.Ferris Bueller is a teenager who fakes out his parents on being sick even though it is his worst performance of being ill somehow it works and his parents let him stay home. He takes the gorgeous day outside takes his really sick best friend and his girlfriend and goes into beautiful Chicago for a blast of good times. I'm not kidding fellow Chicagoians this is the best Chicago movie! Ferris has two problems though his principal who is sick of being made a fool of and decides to bust Ferris on his fake illness. And his sister Jeanie who cares more about Ferris's life than her own and just wants to prove that he's faking it.Even though you have to admit that it's a bit unrealistic that it is broadcast throughout Chicago that Ferris is dying and no one notices that he's singing in the Chicago parade on a field trip to the Art Institute with an elementary class getting snootie with a waiter at Chicago's finest restaurant and catching the Cub's home run ball at Wrigley Field you just have fun and cannot stop laughing. Plus you have got to love Edward Rooney the obsessed principal who is actually sicker than Ferris in one way of putting it. He goes through the whole city to find him just so Ferris doesn't make a fool of him but he fails on all levels because Ferris is just that awesome. The scene between him and Grace when Cameron prank calls to get Ferris' girlfriend out of school is just too hilarious and will have you in stitches. I don't know what else to honestly say other than this movie is the best comedy to watch if you are looking for a great laugh. So sit back and enjoy because life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and take a look around once in a while you might miss it my philosophy. I will love Ferris Bueller till the day I die.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Ferris Bueller's Day Off is the funniest 80's movie EVER! I can list some reasons why I liked this movie so much.1. Matthew Broderick brings such joy to us playing Ferries Bueller a character no one would hate. Ferris NEVER gets caught is an expert at fooling his parents everybody likes him and nobody can avoid his favor and all. I want to be just like him!2. Cameron a geek friend of Ferris is someone that portrays everybody's weakness. He is afraid of his parents negative and also very sensitive of his father's favorite car. This actor who plays Cameron was very very good.3. The principal who tries to prove that Ferris is not innocent and also kind of jealous of Ferris is the most hilarious character in this movie. He sorta reminds me of my principal at High School.4. Jennifer Grey plays Ferris's annoyed sister. She was great and her bad attitude was somewhat hilarious.5. Charlie Sheen's cameo of a guy in police station was absolutely funny.6. This is John Hugh's BEST flick ever. 7. Mia Sara was sweet she played Ferris's pretty girlfriend.8. The most memorable scene was Twist and Shout scene where all people dance in this song with Ferris lipsynching.9. Cameron's speechless and hopeless stare was excellent.10. After watching this movie I am planning to take a DayOff of my own!Overall I give A for being the best teenage movie.".

	schema:headline " My Favorite Movie Of All Time!";
	schema:reviewBody "I think it is only fitting that I dedicate my first movie review to my favorite movie Ferris Beuler's Day Off.This movie got me through High School.. and much of my adult life as well. That is until Office Space came along but that is another review.Ferris Beuller Matthew Broderick was the kid in High School who never got caught had fun doing whatever it was and was popular with everybody. On this particular day in the movie Ferris decides he is taking the day off. After all How can anyone be expected to handle school on a day like this? Ferris calls his best friend Cameron Frye a young Alan Ruck who is always sick and tells him to pick him up. After all Ferris does not have a car. He wants to show Cameron a good time before High School is all over and wants him to have something good to remember about it. Also Cameron is Ferris's phony caller voice. Whenever Ferris needs a call made such as from a police officer or another parent Cameron is the man.Eventually Ferris and Cameron gets Sloane Peterson Mia Sara excused by using the dead grandmother excuse. Ferris is always one step ahead of his adversary Principal Ed Rooney Jeffrey Jones. Rooney is portrayed as a hard ass principal who does not let anything get by him. He sets off to catch Beuller in the act and put a permanent mark in his record and hold him back another year so as not to have other Ferris Beuller wannabes for years after Ferris's departure. Jones was perfect for his role as Rooney and I do not think that role will ever be surpassed for him.Most of the movie is spent with Rooney looking for Ferris and as mentioned earlier is about one or two steps behind him. He comes very close to catching him but never gets the job done. Rooney is the stooge in the movie that every teen and even the adults enjoy seeing him beaten and outsmarted by his young student. I don't think anyone has expected otherwise.All throughout the movie it pokes fun at the boring and tedious high school classroom. Ferris will say something like If we played by the rules right now we'd be in gym class and then it cuts to an exaggerated look at a gym class which more resembles a boot camp. Ben Stein will forever be remembered here as the extremely boring economics teacher.There are many more characters to this movie that make it great. There is Grace Rooney's secretary Jeanie and the rest of Ferris's family the parking garage guys the snooty waiter Charlie Sheen and others. My friends and I still quote randomly from the movie in our everyday situations. That is how much of an impact this movie has made on many lives.There are so many great parts and quotes from this movie they are too numerous to list in a review nor would I want to ruin it for anybody who has not seen it although I can not fathom why you haven't. If not it is a must see.".

	schema:headline " Ferris Bueller is an asshole.";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a big fan of high schoolcomingofage movies I had high expectations from this film. Everyone says it's one of the best comingofage comedies out there and it's maintained that title for nearly 3 decades now. The movie starts off very promising immediately setting itself apart from a sea of derivative titles in the comingofage comedy genre with its rather original protagonist. Most conventional high school films are about an unpopular kid's rise to popularity despite numerous challenges popular kids bullying and rejecting them etc. Ferris Bueller on the other hand is already popular. He's handsome. He's got a girlfriend. All the things that the protagonist has at the end of most high school movies Ferris Bueller starts his day off with. However I now understand why kids like him are usually the villain because Ferris Bueller is just an unbelievable asshole. He fakes sickness to get out of school something we've all done and can relate to but then he drags his actually sick friend Cameron out of bed using all kinds of manipulation not because he enjoys hanging out with him but because he needs a ride. He then pressures Cameron to steal his dad's Ferrari drives to school with the henceforth stressedout Cameron to pick up his girlfriend effectively turning him into the third wheel for the remainder of the day. In fact they barely talk to the guy from that point. Oh and he doesn't return the car after all this instead he drives recklessly for a while to yet further worried protest from Cameron that goes ignored then takes it to a garage and hands the keys to a random guy who also proceeds to drive recklessly with it. He then spends the rest of day doing the weirdest crap. He could drive around in the Ferrari for example or go do drugs or smoke or drink like normal kids do when they skip school or maybe use his popularity and his confidence to get Cameron a girl as well but instead he uses his day off to dine at a fancy restaurant and go to a museum. What high school kid ditches school to go to museum? Oh and apparently he is so popular that he can use his citywide influence to be the star of a whole parade. I'm all for the antihero approach to the otherwise overtold high school story but Ferris Bueller is not a good antihero. You can't relate to him and you don't root for him except only when the school principal develops a strange obsession with exposing Ferris Bueller's whole plan and only then because the principal is an even bigger asshole. The story is mostly not so believable and none of the characters are very layered or developed. From the weirdly adult choice of entertainment to the variety of strange and hardly believable events that unfold such as the principal's obsession or Cameron entering a catatonic state at some point to the parade scene the film feels like a collection of random events sparsely unfolding between a lot of silence or uninterestingunfunny dialog. A big portion of the film is just kinda awkward. In my opinion what makes most teenage movies great is how relatable they are to all of us and to our own adolescent experiences. As teenagers they helped us get through our own lives and as adults they make us laugh at who we used to be. In my opinion Ferris Bueller's Day Off fails in this regard. Maybe if I was myself still a teenager or kind of an asshole I would appreciate this film more. To its credit it doesn't look like it's a movie that hasn't aged well though that would at least explain why such a bad movie is so highly spoken of.".

	schema:headline " Genuinely Ingeniously Funny";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me say that this movie is genuinely ingeniously funny the watchittwelvetimesanditnevergetsold kind of movie. I myself have seen it seven and a half times and will probably view it again before the end of summer. The movie stars then 23yearold Matthew Broderick as 17yearold Ferris Bueller a high school student who would like nothing better than to be done with school. So he gives in to a strong temptation to cut class and go to downtown Chicago with friends Cameron and girlfriend Sloane who he gets out of school extremely cleverly and quite hilariously i might add!. It doesn't take long for principal Edward Rooney to catch on to Ferris's skipping so he tries as hard as he can to catch him but is going on about it quite unsuccessfully. All through the movie we learn of Cameron's struggles with his parents and life itself and through all the hilarity of the movie Cameron finds a part of himself that he hadn't been able to find before. The movie consists of several several fun scenes such as the German American Appreciation Day Parade in which Ferris climbs onto the Great Float and the paradegoers dance to Danke Schoen by Wayne Newton and TWIST AND SHOUT of course by the Beatles. Other very important characters are Jeanie Bueller his revengeseeking sister who can't seem to understand why Ferris gets away with everything and Grace the absentminded and honesttoafault secretary. There are so many left out parts and characters but to see them all you'll have to watch the movie you won't regret it!. Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while you could miss it. ferris bueller I give this movie 2 thumbs up if only i had more hands i could give it a higher rating....".

	schema:reviewBody "After liking''Planes Trains and Automobiles' and having taken into consideration the cult status this film enjoys i was expecting good things. What i got was an irritating little movie where the central conceit leave a bad taste in the mouth. The films message Take a break from the mundanetake a 'Day off'escape the banality of everyday life and find adventure. Whats wrong with that you might say? Well privileged little Ferris Bullers life is anything but mundane. He gets to drive around in a ferarri with a supermodel girlfriend in a world where he never has to take responsibility for his own actions then sits there earnestly telling us about ''life passing him by?'' I wanted to throw things at the screen. Hughes completely misses the point in the same way Ben Stiller did recently with his awful ''Secret Life of Walter Mitty'' these people seeking something more from life already lead perfect lives so its impossible to to relate to them or understand what they have to feel hard done by about. The film is not really a Bildungsroman it does not really deal with coming of age its kind of a bastard relative of the baby boomer movies from the 70s but made for the brat pack generation. We are expected to root for a spoiled overachiever who believes the universe revolves around him and as others have correctly pointed out seems to demonstrate sociopathic personality traits. That i can't do. Hated it.".

Even Charlie Sheen worked in this picture looking like a vampire from Twilight I could barely recognize him being that young I'm more used to his age in Two and a Half Men era. Main character is a sharpie guy that fools everybody and in the end gets away with murder. His sister a correct girl that does everything right ends up being labeled as the bad guy off the story. These scenes are at least useful to remind us that good people always end up being misunderstood. Obviously this film inspired many of modern teen comedies such as American Pie Not Another Teen Movie Road Trip among others. I confess that I enjoyed 1988's License to Drive much more than this one even thought that movie copied many aspects of this. Also Marlon Wayans' productions are much better in making you laugh. All in all it's an interesting movie for the time it was released but offers nothing different of modern comedies.".

I love the jealous sister who really wants to be more like Ferris but just does not feel like she could and I adored Charlie Sheen but still..The movie is filled with situation that are just not really believable.

But that 's not my biggest complaint is not that. I don't mind if movie lacks logic or realism as long as it is entertaining.My problem was that movie didn't live up to hype it got. I didn't find the movie as entertaining or funny as everyone on internet said nor I didn't find Ferris as cool or likable as everyone thinks.First let me talk about the movie. The movie was very dull boring slow and uneventful for me. Even the situation that happens are not so entertaining sometime. For example take museum scene. Sure setting a scene in museum is boring itself.But that is not a big problem. A good director can make a scene set in boring classroom interesting. What makes this scene boring is that characters do nothing. They do not do any mischief they do not destroy anything they do not do prank or the fact that do not give any witty remarks on any painting. They just stand and stare the painting. Instead camera shows the paintings. If I had to see the painting I would use my internet to Google some painting or if I don't have internet I would simply go to public library and read a book about painting. When fun thing actually happen i.e. watching baseball game  they don't show much. Only time I laughed was when Ed Rooney was humiliated.Now let me talk about Ferris Bueller himself. Even if I forget he lies and manipulate people who loves him the most I still don't like this character. I did not find him cool at all. There is no strong reason why he is the most popular kid in school who is worshiped by everyone. Only special thing about him is his unbelievable luck. I found him boring guy who keeps on explaining why is he cool.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think you have to be or have been a teacher to feel as though John Hughes' movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off is like a student scraping his nails across your blackboard for 90 minutes. When this movie was first released I happened to see it on a week where a student came tardy to my class cussed me out when I called him on it and then had his mother phone and tell me that I was overreacting for doing what was expected of me and tell me that she was praying for me. By the time I finished watching the movie Principal Rooney ployed by Jeffrey Jones who was intended as a figure of fun was a very sympathetic character to me.Anyway Matthew Broderick plays the title role an insufferable youngster who appears to have an angel of God at his side. Ferris concocts elaborate schemes for playing hooky from school yet he manages to endear himself to everyone except Mr. Rooney who can never quite catch Ferris in the act and his sister Jennie Jennifer Grey of Dirty Dancing who is justifiably annoyed at Ferris's liberties.One fine spring day Ferris again fools his parents into thinking he is on Death's doorstep. When they leave for work Ferris browbeats his downtrodden buddy Cameron Alan Ruck later of TV's Spin City into stealing his father's prized 1961 Ferrari hijacking Ferris's girlfriend Mia Sara from school and going on a joyride.The angelofGod analogy is particularly apt because the movie seems a latterday version of deusexmachina. And never has a movie seemed so stagy. When Ferris starts talking to the camera presaging similarly selfconscious '90s movies and TV shows expounding his theories on life and skipping school one halfexpects to read Based on a play by Neil Simon in the credits.What a great combinationthe selfrighteousness of John Hughes and the Broadway smarminess of Matthew Broderick. Two minds without a single thought.And the film in constantly at odds with what it tries to tell us. At one point Ferris tells us that you'll never get anywhere by kissing people's hindquarters. Yet he can't get anywhere without sucking up to people or manipulating them for his selfish whims.He also complains about his parents being weird. The poor kidall his parents have ever given him are everything he wants and more attention than his sister can hope to receive.And how is all of this massive manipulation possible? Because Hughes sets up cardboard characters and emotions. Mr. Rooney is essentially Wile E. Coyote forever chasing the Road Runner in vain.Ferris's parents are vapid dummies who don't care much about anything. And Ferris is supposedly made lovable by such acts as his hammy performance to get out of school an old bit when it was used in E.T. and his lipsyncing to a rock song which after Tom Cruise in Risky Business and Rodney Dangerfield in Easy Money was well on its way to become a modernday movie clich.All of the performances are execrable except for Ruck as Cameron the putupon friend. When Cameron vows to take a stand against his dad the scene almost works despite its utter gravity because Cameron has been such a likable dolt up until then. If only we could see a movie about a teenager like him instead of this selfindulgent vehicle about a selfindulgent brat. When John Hughesa Mel Brooks for highschool geekswas asked how he prepares his scripts he said I never start with the jokes. I look at an issue and try to find the story in it...To me 'Animal House' was a character movie. That's funnier than anything in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.".

Little sister Jennifer Grey was actually 26 two years senior to Broderick  but at least the girlfriend was only 19.

When this sort of nonsense is put into this type of film it had better be funny and this wasn't. Equally outrageous stupid and even less humorous if possible was Buehler's supposed duping the maitre d' in the swanky restaurant.

	schema:reviewBody "Austin Powers in Goldmember' provides us with an hour and a half of inspired silliness.  Not all of the film's elements work equally well of course  a seemingly common occurrence in even the best of comedies  but this third in the series of popular spy spoofs generates more laughs than almost any other movie released in 2002.  Prime credit goes of course to Mike Myers who both cowrote the screenplay and inhabits no fewer than four of the movie's main characters. By this time Myers has become so adept at his characterizations that watching him at work and at play here provides one of the prime pleasures of our viewing experience.  Also in attendance are the usual suspects  Verne Troyer as MiniMe Michael York as Basil Robert Wagner as Number 2 Seth Green as Scottie and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissinia.  Folks added to the brew this time around include Fred Savage Michael Caine and Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra a badass soul sister brought back from 1975  Afro hairdo and all  to help Austin rescue his kidnapped father and prevent Dr. Evil from yet again trying to destroy the world this time by using a giant meteorite to melt the polar ice caps and flood the earth.Cowritten by Michael McCullers and directed by Jay Roach the film has the good sense to throw caution to the wind and give Myers free rein to indulge himself in his own brand of inspired lunacy.  The film starts off with a deliriously clever and funny opening credit scene in which many of Hollywood's biggest names make surprise goodnatured cameo appearances. That sense of unbridled fun carries through pretty much the entire film although there are as to be expected ideas bits and jokes that seem less effective than others.  As with the two previous films this Austin Powers' suffers from the unfortunate tendency to both repeat and explain too many of its jokes.  Sometimes you do find yourself wishing that the writers would put a bit more faith in the audience to get the humor the first time around. Still there seems to be much less of that in this particular episode and there are plenty of laughoutloud moments to more than compensate for the occasional  though not all that frequent  clunker or lull that manages to sneak its way in there from time to time. Austin Powers in Goldmember' wallows a bit overmuch in the sordid moments the grossout gags the locker room and bathroom humor that have become alas the hallmarks of the modern comedy.  In short this is probably not the film to take the family to see if your family includes impressionable children andor easily offended adults.  The sexual and scatological meters run into the red zone rather often in this film.  Nevertheless Austin Powers in Goldmember' works well if you enjoy a comedy where the actors seem for once to have been actually having a fun time while making it.   Their infectious joy spills off the screen in a way that it doesn't in movies like Mr. Deeds' Men in Black II' or perish the thought The Master of Disguise' to name just a few of the comedic bombs that have been foisted upon the unsuspecting public this summer.  In contrast to the makers of those films Mike Myers knows how to deliver the goods and in the process give his fans their hardearned money's worth. Reserve us a seat for the next installment.".

That said the sets and costumes are still wonderful the soundtrack is groovy and the script is comedy gold with the cool catchphrases badtaste buffoonery and surreal slapstick.

	schema:reviewBody "While the first two Austin Powers films in this comedic series concentrated on spoofing the late '60searly '70s James Bond movies and concentrated on female anatomy in the process this one was centered on penises. I kid you not. Hence the title a playonwords from Goldfinger. I watched this film twice within two weeks of each as I showed a friend the second time. The first time I thought it wasn't as funny overall as the other two Powers films and was a bit too raunchy especially for the PG13 rating which is ridiculous. After the second viewing I changed my mind about the comedy not the rating it is just as funny if not more than the other two.A couple of the scenes were hilarious although very crude in spots but some of the crudeness is what makes it funny. However most of time I laughed more at the many subtle double entendres and all the double takes by Mike Myers who plays at least four characters in here...all of them very well.It's goofy stupid and nothing spectacular but definitely fastmoving and entertaining. If you've seen the other Austin Powers films you know what this basically is going to be humorwise.Beyonce Knowles who played the female lead didn't have the beauty or body of Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley stars of the other two films but she isn't bad. There are numerous cameo appearances in here starting right off the bat with Tom Cruise.Overall sick again but funny again.".

Mike Myers the comedic genius who made the phrases Yeah baby and the word Shag famous is back again in a movie that is superior to the Spy Who Shagged Me.While the original Austin Powers is better this movie focuses on intellectual jokes. Many of the people I know who didn't like it knowing them it was probably because they didn't understand it. There were a few references to movies even outside the James Bond series. I even remember one instance where Dr. Evil was speaking as though he were Hannibal Lecter in an obvious Silence of the Lambs reference.Beyonc Knowles has proven to be a worthy actress. I don't see what the problem is with singers doing some acting because singing is a form of acting... But I digress. Beyonc had a couple of punchlines much like Hurley and Graham but once again Austin's babe is just there for Austin's or in this case Minime's sex jokes.Goldmember was one of Myers' most creative villains. As simple as lines like I LIKE GOOOOOLD and I am from Sweden. Isn't that weird? sound the delivery makes Goldmember a oneofakind villain and I find him to be even better than Fat Bastard.Myers also cleverly planted some special appearances in that movie and when he does they do draw laughs.I will not compliment the end of this movie. While it was an unexpected plot twist Goldmember could have done better without the scene they closed the movie with especially since this is supposed to be the last movie of the series.If you watch one movie this year watch Star Wars. If you watch two watch the Godfather... but if you watch three watch Braveheart... Ah hell. We all see more than 3 movies a year. Just fit Goldmember in there somewhere!".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Austin Powers film was so fresh zany charming witty and  unique.  It took some time for many people to catch on hence it's legendary  video rental record but it was dazzlingly mesmerizingly adorable.  The sequel came out and rather tarnished the prior film by either  dumping or revising various story elements and especially by taking a  turn towards the crude and vulgar. Still it had it's share of  interesting moments and laughs. In this third installment the goodwill  is almost completely gone. What remains is a hopelessly indulgent  often foul and unfunny conglomeration of jokes and gags many based  on bodily functions or other offkey subjects. That is not to say that  the film doesn't still deliver quite a few laughs. It's just that by  now the whole enterprise seems very worn and familiar. There are  several truly funny sequences in the film but mostly it is saved only  by some surprising and right on star cameos and the fresh appeal of  Knowles. The typically ludicrous plot kicks off with Powers having to  rescue his father Caine from the title character by travelling too  briefly to 1975. Then the whole parade of series characters is  involved in either starting or stopping the world's total destruction.  Myers is undeniably brilliant at creating various characters and giving  them each a voice of his own. He succeeds in creating these people who  seem real unto themselves. Unfortunately he also is bent on catering  to what has to be a 13yearold boy target audience with endless  endless potty jokes and gross out gags. Some of them are very amusing.  Some of them are just gross. After a short while it becomes overkill.  Knowles who is certainly no actress comes across as very attractive  and surprisingly charismatic on film. Her character is mostly  decorative but she serves the purpose very VERY well. Her  takenoprisoners attitude is refreshing even if she is continuously  shown being kicked in the face. By now Myers is so much the whole show  that previous supporting cast members Sterling Green Wagner York  can barely get a word in. Who knows how much of their stuff was cut in  the hourplus of leftover material but certainly plenty of Myers was  left in. It's hard to imagine the lengthier cut because this one seems  interminable even with the bright spots. The opening sequence is  brilliant. The character named Dixie......hilarious full name. Other  creative and funny bits occur throughout but the film can not escape  it's pall of crudeness and alienating selfindulgence.".

The plot is pretty much the same old deal from the first two still spoofing old Bond movies. The acting is still pretty good. The characters are more colorful in this one I think. More developed perhaps. The sexual crude humor is still there and is better here than in the second movie I think. The first is still the best but if you only see one of the sequels I recommend you see this one. I thought the twistintheend was pretty lame but it didn't entirely ruin the movie as it didn't seem totally out of character or totally unbelievable. I'd recommend this to anyone who liked either or both of the first two movies. The humor is mostly the same and people who enjoyed the first two will most likely also enjoy this one. 710".

But then I don't like to write reviews on movies I haven't seen in awhile. This one being almost 7 years.This time out I got tricked. After being somewhat disappointed in Austin Powers The Spy That Shagged Me  comparatively speaking to the brilliant Austin Powers International Man of Mystery I was pumped up after the nowestablished opening dance scene. And I thought this would bring the series back on track. Unfortunately it only goes straight downhill after that.Austin captures Dr. Evil immediately in this chapter but learns through a Hannibal LecterMagneto meeting that another Mike Myers's creation Goldmember is on the loose to cause havoc. Austin must race literally back in time this time in the 1970's to thwart Goldmember's plans. Back to the year 2002 he goes and everyone's where they're supposed to be situated to make an Austin Powers movie.A few things have changed Austin's dad Caine plays an important role Scott becomes more evil while the alwaysscenestealer MiniMe loses some and more history of Austin and Dr. Evil's past is revealed.Sure the movie has its moments. Some parts I did laugh out loud. But for the most part it was definitely getting stale the jokes recycled and the newest uh member Goldmember was unbearable to watch. Yeah I know a lot of humor is grossout jokes but when he eats his skin sorry I never caught that spoofreference it's beyond nasty.Again it's worth maybe one viewing but I have to almost say skip this one and pray if they make a part IV they'll attempt to reboot the series back to its hilarious roots. At least come up with some new jokes.".

I found this movie hilarious and outrageous!  It had a lot of crude humor like Austin hiding behind Mr. Roboto's fountain.  But there was also a good amount of selfparody.  The best scenes included Dr. Evil's prison rap video and the suggestive subtitles in Mr. Roboto's office.  The several cameos were also enjoyable especially Ozzy Osbourne pointing out the joke carried over from The Spy Who Shagged Me.  The scene with Godzilla and its copyright was a relevant joke considering the MPAA's temporary ban on the use of the title Goldmember.  I did have a complaint about the continuity.  The difference in Austin Powers' trademark choppers was noticeable.

And what a great DVD it is. I wasn't the biggest fan of the film but history has taught me that the Austin Powers DVD's are always a top buy.Take for instance the special features. The deleted scenes as with the second Austin powers DVD shine through and present a series of cut sequences and gags which are quite frankly funnier than 90 of the scenes in the films. It's odd but these collections of gags seem almost to work better by themselves and show how strong when stripped down and without the need for a story Myers creations are.On top of that after the almost 15 mins of deleted scenes is a very funny selection of outtakes showcasing Myers talents at their best Dr EvilAustin Powers and worse Fat BastardGoldmember. Simply hilarious.The rest of the DVD  documentaries scene break downs and music videos are good also and prove how much the medium of DVD can shine when time and effort are taken with it.If your not a fan there's little here that will convince you otherwise but Austin Powers fans will rejoice in this DVD.

Simply hilarious.The rest of the DVD  documentaries scene break downs and music videos are good also and prove how much the medium of DVD can shine when time and effort are taken with it.If your not a fan there's little here that will convince you otherwise but Austin Powers fans will rejoice in this DVD. It the words of the man himself Yeah Baby Yeah!";

I only saw this movie because 12 hour work shifts get really long and we have a t.v. here at work... so what are you gonna do?? This movie was hilarious. I was never really impressed with Mike Myers from his Wayne's World lore but he certainly impressed me in Goldmember. The irony of it all is that the funniest things about this movie were the characters Mike Myers played besides Austin Powers. Austin Powers was humorous and had his place but Fat Bastard Dr. Evil and Goldmember were a riot. This movie was a great mix of subtle humor and in your face comedy. This movie propelled me to see the prior two but I don't think they were as funny.Goldmember was excellent and definitely a top comedy in my book.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some reviewers on the Internet have said that the opening scene of Goldmember is absolutely hilarious and likely the best part of the movie. From then on they said the film's jokes hit home less and less.The audience was silent through the opening scene of Goldmember when I saw it. They remained silent for the rest of the film. Those reviewers on the Internet were partially correct. The film did go downhill from the start but the start was terribly unfunny itself. I liked the first film and the second was mediocre. What is good about the third one Goldmember? The new female role is played well unlike the previous film. Verne Troyer gives a strong performance...well that's about it.

From then on they said the film's jokes hit home less and less.The audience was silent through the opening scene of Goldmember when I saw it. They remained silent for the rest of the film. Those reviewers on the Internet were partially correct. The film did go downhill from the start but the start was terribly unfunny itself. I liked the first film and the second was mediocre. What is good about the third one Goldmember? The new female role is played well unlike the previous film. Verne Troyer gives a strong performance...well that's about it.

Now while the ideas were good and it seemed strong it just didn't give.The beginning is classic and it seemed like this was going to be great. I mean we have Tom Cruise playing Austin Powers Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil John Travolta as Goldmember and Danny Devito as Mini Me in the Austin Powers movie! Just great and brilliant. But then the actual movie starts Felicity is not here for no explained reason and Austin is single. Leading him to Foxxy Cleopatra played by Beyonce and is way too stereotypical. Fat Bastard is also back and tries too hard with his disgusting jokes that fall flat.Dr. Evil is still pretty funny but again just loosing his touch. We have a brilliant idea of Michael Caine as Austin's dad but it's a hit and miss with Caine's dull performance. Goldmember also played by Myers is just too disgusting and tries too hard to impress the audience as another funny villain. Scott has now decided to take over the family business which takes his cool and unique style away.  Mini Me is push aside then from Dr. Evil and he joins up with Austin to try again for that shocking and ironic laugh of him now being a Mini Austin. The ending is just ridicules.I'm sorry this just didn't amuse me that much. The jokes were overused and not funny any more. There are too many stereotypical performances in here and the only thing worth watching is the beginning with the amazing cameo's. That was unforgettable but the rest is just a skip. So pass on this one guys it's not worth your time really.610and 4 points of that goes to the beginning!".

It contains all of the features that characterized the finest of his British movies and is as many others have commented a film often undeservedly overlooked amongst Hitchcock's large collection of classics.The actors would all be unfamiliar to most contemporary American viewers but it is a fine cast that does full justice to a good story and that responds well to Hitchcock's expert direction.  Derrick de Marney is engaging as the unjustly accused hero Robert Tisdall and his character is balanced nicely by good performances from the rest of the cast several of whom appeared in more than one of Hitchcock's British movies.As is often the case with Hitchcock's British pictures the title is capable of multiple interpretations.  At the least it could refer either to the hero to the heroine or to the overall atmosphere and themes of the movie. Young Tisdall is being chased by the law but we know from the beginning that he is innocent and his knowledge of that innocence enables him to remain upbeat and even playful despite the dangers and complications he faces.  Erica Nova Pilbeam his reluctant friend and helper is innocent in a different sense.  In the story she finds her youthful naivete especially the assumptions she has acquired in growing up as a chief police constable's daughter challenged by the real world  perhaps for the first time in her life.  Pilbeam is not a glamorous heroine and this may be one of the reasons why Young and Innocent is unjustly neglected but she was a good choice to portray the youthful earnestness and resulting moral dilemmas of her character.  Despite the film's short length it is filled with classic Hitchcock touches of detail artistry and humor many of which are more lowkey than those in his more familiar Hollywood films.  It is worth watching several times in order to catch and appreciate all of the details.  Three sequences are especially worth noting i the renowned tracking shot at the climax of the film which is not only a fine technical achievement but also an ideal way to set up the suspenseful conclusion ii the birthday party in the middle which encapsulates in very subtle ways most of the themes and contrasts of the movie and iii the sequence towards the beginning involving the hero's conference with his lawyer his court appearance and his escape a sequence which is filled with comic details too numerous to catch all at once including one of the director's most humorous cameos.Any Hitchcock fan should thoroughly enjoy Young and Innocent.  Beyond that any fan of thrillers who can look past an unfamiliar cast and who is willing to look for the subtle touches that characterized the great director's British work will also find the film a satisfying experience.".

Though certainly not as welldone as some of his more noteworthy movies I found it to be thoroughly captivating and entertaining with the blend of suspense and humor that one finds in say To Catch a Thief or Family Plot. Derrick deMarney as the romantic lead does a particularly fine job sort of a foreshadowing of the kind of thing Cary Grant later did so well. One thought is that the title is perhaps a bit of a double entendre we always associate the phrase Young and Innocent with a female but the story is really about the attempt of the lead character  a young man  to prove his innocence. Then again is he really the lead or is the story about the girl after all? I'm sure Hitch intended this  touch of ambiguity.Once again I have to thank American Movie Classics for bringing us another worthy movie from the past. Hitchcock fans should not miss this one come to think of it the only dog that I have seen from Hitch is The Paradine Case.".

Granted it may not be as sophisticated as his later films but few films from the 30's are. It has a certain charm and suspense that will hold your interest.This film is filled with Hitchcock's cadre of actors that he used again and again in his early films.....and what a group they are! Nova Pilbeam The Man Who Knew Too Much was a rather strange looking girl but is perfect for the part of the young woman who helps a stranger Percy Marmont Secret Agent as her father Mary Clare and Basil Radford The Lady Vanishes as the aunt and uncle John Longden Blackmail in his usual role as the detective......all these players are top drawer. Derrick de Marney is rather effete as the man on the run but is very effective in the part.Several scenes are particularly outstanding. The opening beach shots are beautifully done and the chase is on! You hold your breath in the sinking car scene even though you know that Miss Pilbeam won't be lost so early in the story unlike Janet Leigh in Psycho. But of course the long tracking shot in the hotel as it zooms in on the drummer man is the one that most people remember and talk about. It's dynamite.The rural setting is delightful and Hitchcock seldom used that slice of life in his films with the exception of The Manxman. That may be what gives the film it's more easy going pace it's more casual feel. Regardless Young and Innocent which is a rather awkward title holds up after 66 years as just another example of the artistry of the Master. Enjoy it....it's worth it.".

In this case accused of murder and the young man is a charming English actor Derrick De Marney. As the police begin their hunt he runs into the police chief's daughter played by Nova Pilbeam a tomboyish answer to Katherine Hepburn and the real star of the movie.This is a late British Hitchcock film and it feels slightly raw around the edges but it's so fast and likable and well constructed you have to love it. In fact the suspense of getting caught is balanced by some downright slapstick scenes that are brief and hilarious. And a reminder that this is a romp the whole thing a beautiful spritely entertainment. Never mind a killer is on the loose because if one man is innocent of murder another out there somewhere it not.This is 1937 and by 1939 Hitchcock has moved to the U.S. to do Hollywood movies including the amazing Rebecca in 1940 and so Young and Innocent and The Lady Vanishes which has a similar quaint feel wrap up his long British period. It says a lot for a movie to say I could watch it again not because it's technically astonishing but because it's just a joy and very sweet.

Were the films he made in England from 1934 to 1939 his best films specifically THE 39 STEPS and THE LADY VANISHES or were the films he made in Hollywood from STRANGERS ON A TRAIN through THE BIRDS his masterworks. I think most Americans favor the latter group and Englishmen favor the former. Certainly he had huge budgets to play with in the 1940s to 1970s whereas his budgets in England were terribly puny. But his basic themes got developed in his English films and he managed to achieve some great effects on those puny budgets.YOUNG AND INNOCENT is probably frequently confused with RICH AND STRANGE a really weird film Hitch made about four years earlier. That was about how a marriage survives an inheritance and trip around the world. This one deals with a mystery by Josephine Tey. In the 1930s to 1960s Ms Tey was the equal as a British mystery novelist of Agatha Christie Margery Allingham and Dorothy Sayers. This is based on A SHILLING FOR CANDLES but most people who remember Ms Tey recall her for two novels based on historical mysteries. One reset in modern times is THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR based on the 1753 mystery of the disappearance and reappearance of Elizabeth Canning in London  a case that literally split English society as equal numbers of witnesses placed her either in a farmhouse as a prisoner while others insisted she was living with a lover. The second and better recalled is THE DAUGHTER OF TIME which tackles the question of the guilt of King Richard III in the various crimes ascribed to him by Sir Thomas More and William Shakespeare  including the murder of his two nephews. Tey's usual hero Inspector Adam Grant concludes history lies the victors determine what is true and Richard is innocent. Although it's research value is dated in 2005 it is still a good place to start looking over Richard's reputation and case.Here the hero Derrick De Marney is suspected rather flimsily actually of having killed a young woman on a beach. He after all helped discover the body. From the beginning we are aware of another person who is more likely to be the killer but after a sinister opening we don't see him again.De Marney flees and his path leads him into that of Nova Pilbeam. She was an up and coming performer of that period in England appearing as the kidnap victim in the original THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH in 1934 and then as the illfated Lady Jane Gray in TUDOR ROSE in 1936. Here she is the daughter of the local police head Percy Marmont  he had been an accidental murder victim of Peter Lorre's in 1936's THE SECRET AGENT. She is convinced of De Marney's innocence and keeps helping him flee including a comic interlude at the home of her uncle Basil Radford during a birthday party. They keep looking up potentially innocentproving evidence and find one more ally Edward Rigby as a helplessly entangled hobo named Will.And they do find the killer as does Marmont and his police in the conclusion when they track him down to the drummer man  in the first really memorable use of a tracking shot by Hitch. He would next use it again in NOTORIOUS in the party scene. The man is in black face a racist element that was acceptable in 1937 unfortunately but we know the key to his identity  his twitching eyes possibly nervousness but also possibly by drugs. His eyes do twitch for the audience before they do for the others. And his nerves suffer the torments of the damned when he sees the police in the room and De Marney. Then he goes into a really wild drumming turn which his boss acidly comments on afterward  it is like a wild animal at bay symbolically.It is not THE LADY VANISHES or THE 39 STEPS but it an effective film for all that. Definitely worth watching.".

There are so many delightful scenes in this movie that it is hard to pick a favorite.  This film reveals all of the signs of genius that Hitchcock would continue to display for many years after this 1937 outing. Young and Innocent is said to be one of Hitchcock's personal favorites from the films that he made in Great Britain before his Hollywood era began.  In my estimation Young and Innocent is just a hair's width from being as good as the other two early directorial triumphs made by him in his British era which are considered classics  The Thirty Nine Steps and The Lady Vanishes.

It is another innocent man on the run story a plot he used often but a plot on which he has done several fascinating variations. In 'Young and Innocent' it is a chase through the English countryside with Derrick De Marney as the accused man Nova Pilbeam as the reluctant helper and the incomparable Edward Rigby as the gentleman of the road caught up in the plot.The visuals are wonderful a man blinking in the lightning storm a lifeless arm in the waves the chiaroscuro interior of a barn  the opening and closing closeups of two different women in different moods legs dangling past a window and of course the celebrated tracking shot towards the end that moves from a large view down to a telling detail. Pure Hitchcock.There are lots of good scenes mixing humour with tension the family dining scene discussing the murder the fight in the truckers caf the children's party where the two on the run find it difficult to leave. The last scene is strangely moving as the drummer goes over the top in more ways than one. There are familiar but good actors in the film such as Mary Clare and Basil Radford. The man playing De Marney's lawyer is perfect too. Nova Pilbeam is particularly effective. Not one of Hitchcock's ice cool blondes which is all to the better. 'Young and Innocent' is a valuable entry in the early Hitchcock canon worth seeing more than once.".

	schema:reviewBody "A young man Derek De Marney is accused of murder and jailed. His lawyer is a greedy nincompoop so De Marney escapes dragging along the innocent daughter Nova Pilbeam of the chief constable Percy Marmont. There follows the sort of comic yet thrilling Chase that Hitch's fans are familiar with from others of his film like Saboteur and The 39 Steps. Nova Pilbeam  great imaginative name by the way  realizes along the way that De Marney is innocent and she falls in with him as they track down the one or two clues they have to the identity of the real murderer. The chase takes them through a flop house run by a surprisingly young Torin Thatcher. There they meet the only man a bum or excuse me a vagabond who can identify the murderer. Not that the absurd character remembers what the killer looks like just that he had a spastic twitch in his eyelids.Their last clue takes the couple to a semielegant supper club with a band playing in the background. Fasten your seat belt because here comes one of Hitchcock's bravura shots. The innocent puzzled pair are seated at a table looking around the hopelessly crowded dance floor for someone with a twitch. The camera pans slowly over the mob of dancers as if they were objects stored in Citizen Kane's warehouse then droops down passes through the dancers approaches the band stand noses through the musicians in black face to an enormous choker of a closeup of the drummer's face. The drummer spots the investigators peering around. His eyes twitch spastically.The drummermurderer luckily is not one of Hitchcock's suave and unflappable villains not like the fourfingered guy in The 39 Steps. This murderer is a nervous wreck. It isn't that De Marney and Pilbeam discover who he is so much as that he gives himself away. He begins banging the drums and cymbals out of synch helplessly falling over the instruments collapsing while the other musicians stare at him. The police drag him away cackling maniacally. The end.The pursuit involves some suspenseful moments particularly a scene in which Pilbeam's old Morris is driven into the mine works and begins to sink as the floor of the shaft begins to collapse under the car's weight. I was happy she was saved. She's delicately appealing. I wouldn't have been broken hearted if the dog Towser had gone down with the sinking car though. But Hitchcock makes certain we see the dog escape safely. He had a weakness for dogs having once owned a Beagle named Philip of Magnesia. Dogs appear in several of his films. He seems never to have been much for cats and he was definitely down on birds.This is a good example of Hitchcock's British works from the 1930s the sort of thing that eventually saw him lured away to Hollywood.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aside from the suspense there are several notable scenes. Two minutes into things and a man opens a front door. Suddenly facing us just beyond the railing is a roiling wall of water an angry sea about to pour over us. I grabbed my seat cushion hoping it would float. Then there's the flop house full of snoring vagrants dead cockroaches and peeling paint. Right away I reached past my highball glass and took the wife's Coke. Topping that is the drive into the mine tunnel. It's a marvel of special effects and timing with an effect as stunning I believe as anything in today's digitally drenched cinema. Nonetheless I checked the garage to make sure my car was still on all fours. The final scene was a contrast since I'd just watched a 40's musical with wildman drummer Gene Krupa. Here it's like watching a windup toy slowly losing its mind.Nova Pilbeam is not exactly a glamor girl with her oversized brow and snub nose still and all for an 18 year old she's one heck of an actress. This is a pretty slender exercise for Hitchcock nothing terribly profound and a lot like The ThirtyNine steps of two years before. Too bad De Marney doesn't generate the kind of charisma or sympathy the Robert Donat part calls for. Hitchcock was to plow this furrow of racing against the law a number of times. Here it's Pilbeam going against her civic duty and constable father to help prove accused murderer De Marney's innocence. Their bond of trust grows over time showing once more that young love often sees what the law cannot at least as far as the movies are concerned.This may not be topflight Hitchcock. Still there are the usual humorous touches darkly suggestive moments and imaginative moves with the camera. So if you've got a spare hour and half see why England should never have allowed that funny looking fat guy an exit visa.".

He claims to have discovered the body and have been running for help but the police think otherwise Tisdall's missing coat and belt helping to convince them that he strangled Clay himself. It is the day of Tisdall's trial where luck and a bit of judgement help him slip away into the crowd and make a break for it. Tisdall turns to Erica Burgoyne for help and she reluctantly gives him a lift despite being the Chief Constable. Quickly he wins her over and against her better judgement she helps him as he tries to recover his missing coat and prove his innocence.This film opens with a wonder scene that is just one of the things that makes me love Hitchcock so much. As we look at the murder weapon the belt being pushed around by the sea it forms a near perfect question mark symbolising perfectly the mystery to be revealed behind this simple object. From here we are given a story that is similar to The 39 Steps in regards the innocent man turning to a female for help in fleeing the law. Unlike that film though I didn't think that this mystery gripped me as much as I would have liked and it wasn't till the final third where I felt that we were getting into it.It doesn't matter too much though because for the first sections it does have a solid pace and charm despite the lack of urgency that comes with these. It is perhaps a bit too slight for modern audiences but for me it was a delight to see Tisdall's wonderfully English escape almost apologetically slipping into the viewing gallery of the court and the way he almost carelessly flees across the country while flirting with Erica. It is enjoyable but I did miss the lack of mystery and was glad when we got into it near the end. Not only did it get more exciting but it also produced a brilliant reveal shot that deserves to be considered as one of Hitchcock's classic shot as we slowly go from a wide shot of a ballroom right into the eyes of the killer on the other side it is a brilliant shot and made all the better by having the cheeky Drummer Man being sung at the same time.De Marney struggles to inject urgency into his character in the same way as the material prefers the charming fun of the piece. He does fit the bill though  not as charming as Cary Grant for example perhaps but he is nicely English without being uptight or stiff. Pilbeam is a stunning woman. Her performance isn't brilliant but again it does just what the film requires and she works well with De Marney. Radford shows up in a solid supporting cast that includes turns from Marmont Rigby Clare and others.Overall a typically strong Hitchcock movie that as a total package doesn't stand up to his best films but it is enjoyable nonetheless and does have at least two scenes that should be mentioned when listing classic Hitchcock moments.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whenever one thinks of Alfred Hitchcock films it's almost impossible not to think about his famous Hollwood period where he directed a series of movies considered among the most important American films in history. Due to this powerful reason his early British work is sadly often forgotten despite of having an enormous importance in the development of his style and a quality sometimes as high as his American films. Of the films of that period 1937's thriller Young and Innocent is a very special case as despite being an excellent movie it's often ignored as is overshadowed by the movies that were done before and after it the popular Sabotage 1936 and the classic The Lady Vanishes 1938. Nevertheless Young and Innocent is an excellent thriller that represents another step in the development of Hitchcock's favorite theme the innocent man on the run.One morning writer Robert Tisdall Derrick De Marney is taking a walk along the seaside cliffs to clear his mind when he makes a gruesome discovery the dead body of actress Christine Clay Pamela Carme washes ashore. As he runs to call an ambulance he is seen by two young swimmers who begin to believe that he is the murderer and call the police. As he returns to the crime scene Tisdall is arrested as a suspect and taken to the station but while at first Tisdall is confident that it's all a mere misunderstanding soon he finds himself in a predicament he had met Christine Clay and she left him a large sum in her will giving him a motive to be the killer. Without any way to prove his innocence he escapes in order to find the real killer and clear his name. On the run he'll find Erica Burgoyne Nova Pilbeam a young woman who begins to believe him even when she is the daughter of Col. Burgoyne Percy Marmont the man in charge to find him.Written by Hitchcock regular collaborator Charles Bennett with Edwin Greenwood and Anthony Armstrong the movie is very loosely based on A Shilling for Candles one of the Alan Grant series of novels by Josephine Tey. The adaptation is not faithful as what happened was that the writers took only the chapters where Tisdall is a fugitive and built their movie from that it doesn't even include Tey's signature character Inspector Alan Grant. What is left is a similar story to The 39 Steps also penned by Bennett but where the romantic comedy elements and the relationship between the couple get a more prominent role than the adventure and suspense of the previous classic. The dynamics between the characters is what sets this movie apart as the main characters have remarkably well developed and have some nice jabs at some screwball comedy during the movie that gives it a charming tone.As written above Young and Innocent is essentially a thriller on the vein of The 39 Steps but while the tone of this story is considerably lighter the Master manages to shows off his dominion of suspense through the film. Brilliantly using the excellent cinematography by Bernard Knowles Hitchcock creates some of his best shot scenes among his British work with a very clever uses of camerawork and miniatures that make this movie one of his most visually pleasing films. However Hitchcock knew that in this story the characters were the star so while many of his camera tricks shine through the movie he never lets the visual effects to overshadow his actors and keeps an excellent balance between the action sequences and the dialogridden scenes. While it certainly feels a tad unpolished when compared to other movies from that period it has plenty of that special something that can only be described as Hitchcocknian magic.In a film like this based entirely around the personalities of the characters the performances by the cast are a key factor in the success of the movie and fortunately this cast doesn't disappoint. Derrick De Marney is quite effective as our innocent man on the run Robert Tisdall delivering his lines with a charming wit that forecasts the characters that Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant would play years later. However who really shines in the movie is the beautiful Nova Pilbeam as Tisdall's unwilling partner in crime Erica Burgoyne. Previously seen in Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much Pilbeam shows off her natural talent in one truly remarkable performance. Edward Rigby has a small yet quite funny role in the film and he makes an extraordinary display of his talent for comedy. The supporting cast is good too and includes nice performances by wellknown actors Percy Marmont and Mary Clare.While in many ways this movie could be considered a minor gem in Hitchcock's career it has enough interesting elements that make it an important movie. The film's blend of suspense and humor wasn't new to Hitchcock who always liked to spiced up things in order to break the tension but Young and Innocent took this one step forward and set the basis for many of the Master's future films. In fact in many ways Young and Innocent could be seen as the companion piece to The 39 Steps in the sense that many years later Hitchcock would take elements from both in his masterpiece North by Northwest. As many critics have already pointed out the witty figure of Derrick De Marney's role has a lot in common with Cary Grant's suave character from that movie. While definitely not a perfect movie Young and Innocent is a nice movie to watch as its charming wit never fails to be amusing. It certainly feels dated by today standards but despite its old age it still is a thrilling tale of adventure and comedy. Sadly neglected as a classic from this period Young and Innocent is definitely as good as most Hitchcock films. Fans of Hitchcock should not miss this one. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "Whenever one thinks of Alfred Hitchcock films it's almost impossible not to think about his famous Hollwood period where he directed a series of movies considered among the most important American films in history. Due to this powerful reason his early British work is sadly often forgotten despite of having an enormous importance in the development of his style and a quality sometimes as high as his American films. Of the films of that period 1937's thriller Young and Innocent is a very special case as despite being an excellent movie it's often ignored as is overshadowed by the movies that were done before and after it the popular Sabotage 1936 and the classic The Lady Vanishes 1938. Nevertheless Young and Innocent is an excellent thriller that represents another step in the development of Hitchcock's favorite theme the innocent man on the run.One morning writer Robert Tisdall Derrick De Marney is taking a walk along the seaside cliffs to clear his mind when he makes a gruesome discovery the dead body of actress Christine Clay Pamela Carme washes ashore. As he runs to call an ambulance he is seen by two young swimmers who begin to believe that he is the murderer and call the police. As he returns to the crime scene Tisdall is arrested as a suspect and taken to the station but while at first Tisdall is confident that it's all a mere misunderstanding soon he finds himself in a predicament he had met Christine Clay and she left him a large sum in her will giving him a motive to be the killer. Without any way to prove his innocence he escapes in order to find the real killer and clear his name. On the run he'll find Erica Burgoyne Nova Pilbeam a young woman who begins to believe him even when she is the daughter of Col. Burgoyne Percy Marmont the man in charge to find him.Written by Hitchcock regular collaborator Charles Bennett with Edwin Greenwood and Anthony Armstrong the movie is very loosely based on A Shilling for Candles one of the Alan Grant series of novels by Josephine Tey. The adaptation is not faithful as what happened was that the writers took only the chapters where Tisdall is a fugitive and built their movie from that it doesn't even include Tey's signature character Inspector Alan Grant. What is left is a similar story to The 39 Steps also penned by Bennett but where the romantic comedy elements and the relationship between the couple get a more prominent role than the adventure and suspense of the previous classic. The dynamics between the characters is what sets this movie apart as the main characters have remarkably well developed and have some nice jabs at some screwball comedy during the movie that gives it a charming tone.As written above Young and Innocent is essentially a thriller on the vein of The 39 Steps but while the tone of this story is considerably lighter the Master manages to shows off his dominion of suspense through the film. Brilliantly using the excellent cinematography by Bernard Knowles Hitchcock creates some of his best shot scenes among his British work with a very clever uses of camerawork and miniatures that make this movie one of his most visually pleasing films.

	schema:reviewBody "Sir Alfred Hitchcock England's stout goodhumored master entertainer elaborates upon a Josephine Tey story for another of his early snappishly paced exceptionally acted thrillers. Although it pines for the nerveshredding anticipation the feverish exhilaration of The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes this bridging piece between them has a more muted appeal that fulfills his intentions and ours practically as well.Hitch had the wicked gift of breathing dread into the ordinary. A tranquil English countryside under his gaze swiftly becomes murky and menacing. A railroad yard can be made as portentous and shadowy as Dracula's Transylvanian castle. A swarming dance floor in a hotel dining room turns out to be ominous and tense. When murder disfigures a sleepy English village Hitch can be relied upon to see that histrionic justice is restored.In this brisk retread of The 39 Steps a woman's corpse drifts ashore along with the belt of a man's raincoat to corroborate Scotland Yard's premise that she had been strangled not drowned. Her young charge is arrested swearing his raincoat was pinched in a pub one night. Hitchcock jerks his baton and allows the jailbird a getaway to provoke the concern of the chief constable's daughter. Together they trail the hunt for the stolen raincoat the old china mender and the mysterious man with the twitching eyes who gave the coat away.These are the sensational everyday things that the cinema's great producer of goosebumps has warped and laced into a tight pelt of escapades and melodrama. He is privileged in the avail of his coconspirators. Nova Pilbeam plays the constable's daughter with a freshfaced and surprisingly spontaneous allure and a pleasant effortlessness. Derrick De Marney as the wrong man is enjoyably lighthearted in the silhouette of the death axe but what really makes it a relentlessly moving adventure story is what it has in common with other Hitchcock pictures a committee of charming characters surrounding the leads.

	schema:reviewBody "When this film was released in the U.S. its title was altered to The Girl Was Young which implies that somebody in America misunderstood the significance of its British title Young and Innocent. The word young in the title refers not to a girl but to a young man and he is innocent not in the sense that he is naive which the phrase young and innocent normally implies but in the sense that he is not guilty of the crime of which he is suspected. The theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime was to become a familiar one in the works of Alfred Hitchcock and he had already used it in another film from his British period The 39 Steps from two years earlier. The two films in fact have many similarities although Young and Innocent unlike The 39 Steps or The Lady Vanishes does not deal with espionage. The body of a young actress named Christine Clay is washed up on a beach somewhere on the English coast. It is discovered by a young man named Robert Tisdall a friend of the dead woman who runs off to get help. Unfortunately he is seen doing so by two girls who assume that he is the murderer and call the police. Robert is arrested and things begin to look bad for him when it is discovered that Christine was strangled with the belt from an overcoat similar to one he once owned. To make matters worse it comes to light that Christine has left Robert a large sum in her will. Why she should have done this is never made clear given that the two were friends but not lovers. Presumably this detail was inserted to supply a plausible motive.Of course Robert is not the real murderer. Hitchcock generally did not deal in Agatha Christiestyle whodunits in which the identity of the killer is kept from the audience until the very end. Here it is made clear from the beginning that the real culprit is Christine's obsessively jealous husband who for some reason is not suspected by the police. The police in fact are here shown as bumbling and incompetent as they often are in Hitchcock's films. Robert's barrister proves to be equally inept so Robert decides that his best course of action is to go on the run in an attempt to find the evidence which will prove his innocence. Like Richard Hannay in The 39 Steps he goes on a crosscountry odyssey accompanied by a blonde young woman in this case Erica Burgoyne the daughter of the local Chief Constable whose men are searching for Robert. In both films the fugitive's female companion is initially forced to go with him against her will but later comes to believe in his innocence and falls in love with him. Like a number of Hitchcock's films Young and Innocent combines a basically serious theme Robert is after all accused of a crime which in 1937 could have sent him to the gallows with a good deal of humour. Some of this humour is satirical aimed at the incompetence of the police force and court system although there are other humorous scenes such as those involving Erica and her three younger brothers or the one at the children's party.Derrick De Marney is not a very charismatic hero not in the same class as Robert Donat from The 39 Steps or Michael Redgrave from The Lady Vanishes although the young Nova Pilbeam only eighteen at the time makes a fresh and charming heroine. Nova also played the kidnapped teenager in Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much from three years earlier although her acting career seemed to fizzle out in the forties and I often wonder what happened to her. She is apparently still alive. The film does not contain any great Hitchcock set pieces except perhaps for the finale in the Grand Hotel when the murderer is eventually unmasked. This scene has caused some controversy in recent years because of the presence of a dance band performing in blackface although this would not have been seen as controversial in thirties Britain. Overall I would not rate Young and Innocent as Hitchcock's greatest film from his British period but it is still a fastmoving and enjoyable light thriller. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Young and Innocent aka The Girl Was Young is rarely mentioned in the same breath as The 39 Steps or The Lady Vanishes but it is nevertheless one of the more underestimated films from the master of suspense with all the ingredients of a Hitchcock classic.Alfred Hitchcock loved the theme of a man accused of a crime he didn't commit and used this successfully in other films like The 39 Steps which preceded Young and Innocent and later Saboteur and North by Northwest.He wanted to introduce a fresh approach in this film with stars that were young and relatively unknown and cheap. Nova Pilbeam had featured a few years earlier in The Man Who Knew Too Much and was a fairly prominent childteenage actress and Derrick De Marney had had some moderate success but both actors were not well known overseas.Hitchcock added his usual array of interesting character studies which typified so many of his films. I always thought that he never wasted a character in any of his films with even the smallest bit part being used effectively. Young and Innocent is no exception with a couple of wonderful cameos from J.H Roberts as the myopic solicitor who advises his client We mustn't be depressed on a day like this after he has been accused of murder.George Curzon as the villain plays an aggrieved black faced drummer who has been two timed by his actress wife who he dragged out of the gutter to make a star. Curzon hams it up to the hilt complete with a twitch which eventually leads to him being exposed as the murderer.Edward Rigby is the quintessential tramp who dons an uncomfortable tux to enter the Grand Hotel in another fine cameo role. Basil Radford and Percy Marmont as the kindly Police Chief are also very impressive in their small roles.The film closes with one of Hitchcock's most impressive scenes from all of his films. He loved the concept of furthest to nearest with the camera moving slowly from a very wide shot through the hotel to finally focus on the drummer. He used a crane to achieve this in Young and Innocent and it must have been an extremely innovative and logistically difficult task in 1937. He used the concept again in Notorious and other films to great effect.Young and Innocent has all the charm and humour that typifies so many Hitchcock movies and is set in another world  country England in 1937.I have always thought that Hitchcock's English films from the mid to late 1930s produced some of his best work and this is a forgotten gem that helped progress him to Hollywood.Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many of Hitchcock's early films share story elements because he used the same writer Charles Bennett for the screenplays. So you find Young and Innocent sharing the beginning of Sabotage by immediately revealing the identity of the villainmurderer turning both films from mysterythriller into simple thriller. And it shares with The 39 Steps a hero on the run with a reluctant heroine as they work to clear his name they fall in love. A woman is found dead on a beach the police determine that she did not drown but was strangled with the belt of a raincoat. Robert Tisdall Derrick De Marney is the prime suspect in part because he was observed running from the scene and in part because he is known to have owned a similar type of raincoat. Robert's claim that his raincoat was stolen at a lorry station a few days before is not believed and his court appointed barrister does not inspire confidence. So he escapes and with the help of Erica Burgoyne Nova Pilbeam dashes about the countryside seeking the elusive raincoat in order to clear his name. As a further complication Erica's father is the chief constable.Like The 39 Steps the story has a lighter tone than most of Hitchcock's thrillers nicely blending comedy with suspense. It lacks that films interesting technical elements but does feature a nice climatic sequence where a continuous crane shot moves slowly over a crowded dance floor to end inches away from the twitching eyes of the murderer who has not been shown since the opening scene of the film. The film seems to be hacked up a bit jumping in and out of scenes at inappropriate times as if a poor job of trimming was done and incompletely restored sometime in the almost 70 years since the original edit. This is disconcerting but not fatal as the themes of disguise and visual impairment are still quite clear. Robert escapes from the courthouse by donning his defense lawyer's glasseswhich impair his vision Old Will dresses up in a new suit in order to infiltrate the hotel but is too concerned with the police to spot the murderer the murderer appears in blackface but has trouble seeing because of a nervous tick in his eyelids. Ironically it is the medication he takes for this condition that causes Erika to finally notice him. Hitchcock's skills in casting and directing actors is rarely mentioned but he had a amazing ability to select an actress at the perfect moment of her career for the performance he needed. Nova Pilbeam was only 18 during the filming but she had considerable experience as a child actress. This allowed her to play a confident and capable heroine and yet project a charming navet. Her resemblance to Kiera Knightley is almost spooky going beyond simple appearance into speech and mannerisms. This time the MacGuffin is the raincoat and it enables Hitchcock to have a double chase for most of the film as Robert pursues his raincoat he is being pursued by the police. For those who have never heard this a MacGuffin is Hitchcock's term for a plot device often used in thrillers that motivates the characters and advances the storybut has little other relevance to the story itself. Unlike other types of plot devices it is not important what specifically the object is anything that could serve as a motivator could be used. And from an audience perspective the MacGuffin is not the point of the story. Thus in Young and Innocent the hero and heroine pursue the raincoat only to discover than it will not be useful for the purpose they intended. It then goes from central focus to insignificance. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

Unlike other types of plot devices it is not important what specifically the object is anything that could serve as a motivator could be used. And from an audience perspective the MacGuffin is not the point of the story. Thus in Young and Innocent the hero and heroine pursue the raincoat only to discover than it will not be useful for the purpose they intended. It then goes from central focus to insignificance. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.";

We don't really care about WHO is guilty or WHY the crime occurred. These reasons and their clues are truly irrelevant. Quick now what were the criminal motives in Vertigo or NorthBy Northwest. Does anyone care? I was surprised to hear that so many British viewers prefer the British films to the American ones. Robin Wood certainly wouldn't agree with them there. There was more sunlight and music in this film and very little dark than in say The 39 Steps although there is humor in both. As a matter of fact there is black humor to be found in Psycho throughout the film for those willing to look for it. For the record although never shown specifically in the film Tony Perkins was popping candy corn in his mouth during the grueling encounter with Janet Leigh in the office of the motel and the stuffed birds on the wall!Curtis Stotlar".

	schema:reviewBody "The characteristics of British cinema back in the classic days tended towards a selfreferential sense of playfulness. There was exaggeration but not with the baroque weirdness of German Expressionism and Pinewood seemed to take itself a little less seriously than Hollywood. Take the thriller. All thrillers regardless of how highmindedly they ostensibly dealt with death and danger are essentially excuses for excitement. The British thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock are simply an open acknowledgement of that fact and no matter how gruesome or twisted their subject matter are always rolled out with a disrespectful sense of fun.Young and Innocent is a bit of an odd hybrid for the Master of Suspense. As with nearly all of his later British works it takes the form of a fastpaced adventure in which a male and female protagonist are thrown together by circumstance and is typical of the screenplays of crucial collaborator Charles Bennett. However it differs in that rather than being about spies and international intrigue the catalyst for the adventure is a murder something Hitch would have far more dealings with in his Hollywood career. This aspect makes Young and Innocent a very visually dynamic picture as the director gets to indulge his streak of morbid sensationalism. The picture opens with a series of startling sounds and images a couple arguing faces moving into the frame a closeup of seagulls screeching as the body is discovered. It's a classic Hitchcock murder  grisly fascinating but never tragic. This attentiongrabbing prelude pays off later on because once the adventure is underway the details of the slaying fall by the wayside and yet because of those closeups we are able to recall them easily when they become important again at the end of the picture.As the title would suggest youth and innocence are written upon the faces of the two leads. Freshfaced Derrick De Marney is both charming and trustworthy in one of his earliest lead roles making a likable if not exactly rugged hero. The one to watch here however is Nova Pilbeam who at eighteen genuinely was a youngster. Perhaps because of her youth she really embodies the sense of adventure and makes it seem completely plausible that she would gladly run off with a man accused of murder. In her one emotional scene she does not resort to the hysterics of many actresses of the time and her believable breakdown into tears reminds me very much of similar performances by Judy Garland. De Marney and Pilbeam are accompanied by Edward Rigby as a lovable old tramp. Rigby is not a bad substitute for Edmund Gwenn who normally got these roles and his appearance as Britishstockcharacterturnedunlikelyhero is really a joy to watch.And it is things like this Rigby character that are at the heart of Young and Innocent. You just wouldn't get that in an equivalent picture from the US. In Hollywood a bum is a bum and he wouldn't just start running round helping the goodlooking young leads unless of course he smartened himself up a bit like William Powell in My Man Godfrey. It's that goodnatured willingness to make your serious picture slightly undignified in the name of fun.".

This small gripe however didn't deter my enjoyment of the film.Much credit has to be given to director Jon Amiel Sommersby Entrapment for effectively capturing the atmosphere and tension prevalent throughout the film. In addition writers Ann Biderman and David Madsen deserve credit for a intelligent wellresearched screenplay. No clichs here just sharplycrafted dialogue. And Christopher Young's inspired score is brilliant just listen to the theme that plays early on as Helen calms down after a panic attack.Copyat may not be classic material but it's a strong entry in a genre that's too often consumed by formulas and gore.

Attacked in the bathroom she narrowly escapes death and becomes a social recluse in the years that follow  living through the Internet anonymously chatting on Internet chat rooms and so on and so forth.Until the terror begins again this time involving not only the expschologist Sigourney Weaver but also a cop played by Holly Hunter.Copycat was much better than I thought it would be. I originally saw it on TBS years ago I remember the ads claiming it would be on but for some reason the rights fell through and it didn't air for another month or so... through this time period I hadn't heard anything about the film but within the very first few minutes I instantly knew it was going to be much better than the standard Silence ripoff.I may be alone here and trust me I know it but I enjoy this more than Silence of the Lambs which kind of bores me at times. Copycat is dark and unexpectedly intelligent  it is also perfectly cast. Weaver is fine if unexceptional whereas Hunter's machofemale traits are put into play perfectly by her casting as a cop.The killer in the movie is played by Harry Connick Jr. and even he does a good job which is saying quite a lot.The movie has unexpected twists and is very clever in its own right. It is undoubtedly influenced heavily by Silence of the Lambs but is successful in the way it adds its own qualities to the mix  much like Se7en this is a serial killer movie cashing in on the success of Silence but not necessarily stealing its content.Very surprised. Catch it if you can.".

The murderer uses old photos and the books of Weaver to recapture the essence of each brutal killing.  Murders are done ala Albert DeSalvo Son of Sam Ted Bundy Jeffrey Dahmer and others.  The film is very fascinating and yet very twisted too.  The killer is played with such conviction by William McNamara. Another killer in prisonthe one that attacked Weaver is played with unusual repulsivenes by Harry Connick Jr.  The real star here is the script which has unusual intelligence for such subject matter.  There is a good deal of violence yet a subtle humour pervades much of the discussion between the cops and even Weaver and Hunter in a few scenes.  But the thrill aspect of the film...the raw suspense...steers the picture from beginning to end.

	schema:reviewBody "It all starts with Dr. Helen HudsonWeaver giving a lecture on serial killers little knowing that she's about to have an encounter with one. After her lecture is over she visits the restroom and is attacked by one Daryll Lee CullumConnick. Flash forward 13 months. We see Hudson yet again but this time she's confined to her apartment. You see she's now an agoraphobic having retired after that fateful day. At the local police precinct detectives M.J. MonahanHunter and Ruben GoetzMulroney are tracking a killer of their own played by William McNamara. He appears to be mimicing the MO's of various famous serial killers. Hudson hears about this over the radio and calls the precinct with some information. She speaks to Monahan who thinks it's a crank call. Monahan and Goetz pay a little visit to Hudson's residence carrying with them photographs of the recent crime scenes. Hudson determines the killer is indeed copying other serial killers. A while later an unseen visitor breaks into her apartment leaving the dress she was wearing the day she was attacked by Cullum neatly spread out on her bed. Her home is no longer safe. Monahan and Goetz have dragged her back into the world she tried to leave behind. Now Hudson must help the detectives catch the copycat before she becomes the next victim.Realistic in just about every aspect Copycat is right up there with Silence of the Lambs. Comparisons to Seven are not unwarrented but the plot here is more believable. A very good cast with Weaver giving one of the best perfomances of her career. Hunter and Mulroney are also excellent. The film is provided a very tense and terrifying atmosphere thanks to director Jon Amiel. It doesn't need to wallow in needless violence and gore because it has what every great Thriller needs suspense on an epic scale. The violence is kept to a minimum but what it contains can be a bit unsettling if for no other reason than because we get to know how the killer thinks. Along the same lines Weaver's portrayal of an agoraphobic is perfect. You don't have to imagine what Weaver is feeling when she steps out of her apartment or what the killer is feeling while he murders his victims. You feel every bit of it which is why this film succeeds so masterfully.Copycat is that rare film that comes along every other year or so that has the ability to pull you into it. It takes you on a most terrifying journey into the mind of a serial killer and the doctor that understands him. I can't say anything more except that I love this film. Hitchcock would've been proud.".

At the beginning you don't really know what the movie is going about and everything is build up in a good nonforced or overdone way. In the beginning its still a mystery who's behind the killings and it even is subtly implied that the killers could be one of the cops or one of the other characters in the movie. The movie however takes a twist when it fully shows the killer his preparations and his actions. The movie is at times told completely from the killers point of view. This works surprisingly effective and it doesn't ruin the tension or mystery of the movie in any way.What makes the movie effective and also in a way distinctive is that the main characters of the movie are two female characters. They are being portrayed by about the two strongest female leading Hollywood ladies of the moment Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. They are two strong and independently different from each other characters that know to carry the movie. The movie also has an excellent supporting cast with Harry Connick Jr. in a disturbing role Will Patton and the fairly unknown William McNamara as the killer of the movie. The fact that he isn't as well known as an actor perhaps makes his character work out all the better.I have yet to see a Jon Amiel movie that is original on its own. His movies always heavily 'borrow' from other movies in the same genre. He's a real 'copycat' himself you may say. Copycat is really no exception to this but it this case it didn't bothered me since the execution of it all was superb and effective.The movie is basically good and tense from start till finish due to a good pace interesting well written and developed characters and a good overall build up. The movie perhaps at the end turns into a bit of a formulaic and simple one but it doesn't really downgrade the movie in any way. It all makes this movie one of the better genre movies of the last couple of years. The movie has basically everything in it that is needed to make a good thriller.The movie is good looking with an overall nice visual style some nice cinematography nimble editing and a suiting musical score from composer Christopher Young.A simply great genre movie that deserves some more recognition and that holds up surprising well against other classic genre examples such as Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. 810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the BEST thriller ever made. I know everyone will crucify me for saying this but I was bored by much of Se7en. I think that Copycat is far superior. As for Silence of the Lambs comparisons  yes they are similar with one convicted killer aiding people in catching another killer at large and Lambs is naturally amazing it deserved its Oscar though it is not as scary as Copycat. For some reason Copycat struck the right chord with me. The small details of the killings are so clever and creepy and they add to the atmosphere wonderfully. Sigourney Weaver is in one of the greatest roles of her career though she is always fantastic as is the remarkable Holly Hunter who also provides some humor. Dermot Mulroney William McNamara and Harry Connick Jr. round out the fine cast. However in addition to the powerful female leads it is the story that drives this movie. I was so hooked by it and every twist had me on the edge of my seat. It is both terrifying AND wellmade. And the score! I can't even begin to say how beautiful and haunting the music is. This is one movie I am very happy to own.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is the BEST thriller ever made. I know everyone will crucify me for saying this but I was bored by much of Se7en. I think that Copycat is far superior. As for Silence of the Lambs comparisons  yes they are similar with one convicted killer aiding people in catching another killer at large and Lambs is naturally amazing it deserved its Oscar though it is not as scary as Copycat. For some reason Copycat struck the right chord with me. The small details of the killings are so clever and creepy and they add to the atmosphere wonderfully. Sigourney Weaver is in one of the greatest roles of her career though she is always fantastic as is the remarkable Holly Hunter who also provides some humor. Dermot Mulroney William McNamara and Harry Connick Jr. round out the fine cast. However in addition to the powerful female leads it is the story that drives this movie. I was so hooked by it and every twist had me on the edge of my seat. It is both terrifying AND wellmade. And the score! I can't even begin to say how beautiful and haunting the music is. This is one movie I am very happy to own.";

And the allknowing psychologist who surmises that he has technical lab job can't figure out that he has access to sperm samples and get police over to IVF labs? Really? The most unbelievable part of Copycat is that the Dr. gets attacked multiple times in her apt yet police put a singlebumbling officer outside her door time and time again. The movie has some suspense but it is not even close to top thrillers of alltime. Too highly rated on Amazon and by many here..".

Weaver's acting is sensational and as this was the first film I saw her in I am keen to watch other films she has appeared in. Holly Hunter maybe overshadowed throughout but is still able to maintain a dominant force within the police force as the lead detective. However I did have a few questions remaining at the end of the film which is somewhat an anticlimax. Also novices will find the twisting storyline and heavy information regarding deaths suspicions and lists of potential goings on and paste vents a little hard to follow and personally I felt some of it was a bit unrealistic and farfetched. Female representation. I personally thought it was great seeing two women as the two central characters in this film. It reflected a change in society and more equality in the workplace. Having two very strong actresses in Hunter and Weaver allows the film to be carried through them and is remarkable twist and turn of events the two have to go through letting us see their powerful sides but also their weak vulnerable sides. Direction. Worth mentioning as some scenes were simply breath taking watch out for the ending to see what I mean. i strongly recommend this film to anyone with a thirst for fast energetic plots and action.".

I highly enjoy its marvelous character development and the tense feeling this whole production generates.Sigourney Weaver portrays a criminologist who specializes in serial homicide. After years of lecture tours on the subject and the serial killers themselves she is attacked and traumatized so badly that agoraphobia takes a firm grip on her psyche. As time goes on the intensity of her condition increases to its worst degree.Now more than a year later she comes face to face with her worst nightmare a new incarnation of Daryll Lee 'Killer' Cullum. Ripped away from everyone she can trust everyone she has allowed even nominally close to her she is totally alone and at the mercy of her greatest fear. As her tormentor's plot develops you will find yourself literally on the edge of your seat.Killer Cullum is portrayed in a startling manner by Harry Connick Jr. His follower 'Peter Curtain Foley' is convincingly portrayed by William McNamara.While the cinematography of this production was little more than average the settings and scenery were creatively executed. You never get the feeling that they shot this movie in five rooms that they kept redecorating as you do in many films of this type. The direction was very well done and Sigourney Weaver is absolutely convincing as the 'pillpopping juicehead hyperventilating agoraphobic sshle.' Inspector M.J.

However the pace and excellent plot twists keep the movie from being a Copycat of other less dynamic movies. This is in the same vein as By the Sea only I think about 3x better. There is a double entrendre that ends up getting someone killed inside the police station that is not considered a plot issue however it leaves the viewer thinking there is more to the incident than what is portrayed.

Have we been so inundated with this type of graphic entertainment that we've all become virtual sadists?Well I have another theory. One supported by talking to other fans of such movies.In my experience a lot of women are fans of these films. Just look at the Lifetime Network which has spawned two spinoff networks one of which shows women in jeopardy movies almost 24 hours a day. Women who watch these movies will tell you it's not because they enjoy seeing other women being brutalized. In fact some of these movies touch on their worst fears things they hope never happen to them and would never wish on anyone else.I think the appeal of these movies is that in the end the bad guy the stalker rapist or serial killer gets punished. In real life where the villains often get away with committing unspeakable acts where right doesn't always win we like seeing a movie where justice whether at the hands of the courts or the victims gets done. And in a strange way when we are shown graphically how truly terrifying the villain is the true horror of his crimes it makes his eventual downfall even more satisfying.I think we watch action and even horror films for the same reason. Because we know that in the end the day will be saved and the bad guy will get what's coming to him. The good guys will win which isn't always a certainty in real life.I certainly know that my favorite parts of COPYCAT weren't the scenes where the serial killer claimed another victim.

If you're into serial killer lore like myself you'll love this movie a satisfying addition to the genre.

Yes I know that many of the reallife serial killers he copies were notorious for appearing normal and nonscary at first like Dahmer and Bundy but it was after they were uncovered that they became frightening. Right up until he gets shot McNamara didn't scare me at all. And as for that face he pulls when Weaver starts laughing at him in the bathroom it just makes him look like a spoilt child and almost made me laugh out loud.But if you try and tolerate McNamara then the rest of the cast won't disappoint.

The pace is incredible the characters are so well developed. Sigourney Weaver is great and has the flashy role of the film but it's Holly Hunter that delivers the most amazing performance she is very convincing and has such a grasp for the role. Dermot Mulroney gives a very appealing performance. Quite engrossing and intense. The taut direction by Jon Amiel is excellent he does a great job keeping the viewer interested. The plot is clever and intriguing. Good score well photographed. Impressively made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Screams of the victim deaden his pain. The act of killing makes him feel intensely alive. What he feels next is not guilt but disappointment. It was not as wonderful as he'd hoped. Maybe next time it will be perfect. Dr. Helen Hudson speaking on serial killers. Copycat is a firstclass psychological serial killerdillerthriller nearly undone by a conventional slasherthriller climax. The end works well enough but once you've seen one jumpoutandscareus sprayintheface lastminutesave clich you've seen them all. The only difference in the clichs is how close we get to the blade going in the skull cap blasting off and the last minute twist being irrelevant to the story. What makes Copycat so superior to the others can be summed up in two names Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. Weaver plays Helen Hudson an authority on serial killers in demand for lectures consulted by the police and a smart woman. That all changes when she is attacked by a serial killer and barely survives. The guy winds up in prison for life. Hudson winds up a prisoner too. Thirteen months later we can see that she's been so traumatized that she has turned her apartment into a fortress. She's too frightened to venture outside. She needs liquor to get through the hours and pills and paper bags to deal with the panic attacks. She trusts few others. She deals with life through her computer. She's still an authority on serial killers but her life has become a wasteland. She does have that terrific San Francisco apartment. Then she discovers that there is a new killer at work one who mimics the style of killing that other serial killers have used. When she tells the police that recent horrible murders are being committed by one madman that brings us to Holly Hunter who plays police inspector M. J. Monahan. Monahan is quick smart feisty small and yeah kinda cute. She's also tough enough to make big male cops nervous. She's friendly she's liked she's prickly and no one doubts who's in charge when she's on a case. Dead bodies don't bother her too much. Monahan is a pro. Between Hudson's knowledge of serial killers as wracked out as she is and Monahan's gritty persistence it's not long before we...then Hunt...then Monahan...realize Hunt has become the target for the copycat killer's affections. Now we're in the middle of a stylish murderous catandmouse game. Monahan working with the difficult isolated Hudson is determined to capture this man. And the serial killer is going to go after Hudson locked away in her fortress of an apartment. Copycat gives us every old favorite in the book...darkened hallways closed shower curtains empty bathrooms cops tricked off their assignments ingenious ways to kill...and they still work. In an added twist the current killer seems somehow to be able to communicate to the man who attacked Hunter and who now is in a secured slammer. The only real drawback if one doesn't mind too much the standard scares at the end is the movie's length...more than two hours. If the director had had the energy to lop off 20 minutes the way the serial killer lops off lives the movie in my view would have been even better. Even so Copycat is a fine intelligent movie made special by Hunter and Weaver and with effective performances by Will Patton Dermot Mulroney and a really unpleasant Harry Connick Jr. The score is lowkey and evocative. There's even a song by Sting and Andy Summers that the killer seems particularly fond of It's murder by numbers one two three  It's as easy to learn as your a b c  Murder by numbers one two three  It's as easy to learn as your a b c Now if you have a taste for this experience  And you're flushed with your very first success  Then you must try a twosome or a threesome  And you'll find your conscience bothers you much less Because it's murder by numbers one two three  It's as easy to learn as your a b c.".

It takes the help of Helen to come to the conclusion they had a copycat killer on their hands thus the name of the movie. This copycat killer was very specific copying crime photos down to the tee. It made the movie more interesting.Daryll Lee Cullum Harry Connick Jr. was the serial killer that attacked Helen which caused her to stay indoors and eventually copied by the copycat.Upon the first hour I thought the movie would be more of a whodunnit but we are then introduced to the killer and it becomes more of a How are they ever going to catch this guy? type of movie.Overall the cast was excellent. Connick played a convincing serial killer. Weaver was pretty good as the expert although I was a bit annoyed by her at times. And easily the best part of the movie was Holly Hunter. She was the stand out actress in this movie and it was her girlish charm that made her likable. At 2 hours I never caught myself looking at the time so that is a good sign for any movie. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "The Ring was made from the only screenplay Hitchcock wrote himself and it deals as many of his earliest pictures do with a love triangle. At first glance it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelitythemed morality comedies of Cecil B. De Mille but more than that it is the first really competent Hitchcock picture. Even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense.As well as being a student of the German Expressionist style the rhythmic editing style of Sergei Eisenstein had had its impact upon Hitchcock. But here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery. This is apparent from the opening shots where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo. And like Eisenstein the editing style seems to suggest sound  for example when a splitsecond shot of the bell being rung is flashed in we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring.There is also a contrast particularly with silent films from the US in that The Ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards. As much as possible is conveyed by imagery and Hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lipread or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters' speech. And it's not done by contrived symbolism or overacting it's all done by getting the right angles and the right timing particularly with pointofview shots as well as some strong yet subtle performances. There are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices particularly double exposures many of which were unnecessary but there is far less of this than there is in The Lodger.Let's make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors. First up the stunningly handsome and very talented Carl Brisson in the lead role. In spite of his talent I was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist! But that just goes to show how much I know as it turns out Brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting. Playing his rival is the competent Ian Hunter who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the 60s. The most demanding role in The Ring has to be that given to Lillian HallDavis torn between two lovers. She pulls it off very well however with an emotive understated performance and it's a shame her career never lasted in the sound era. And last but not least the great Gordon Harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role.The Ring's climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silentera Hitchcock. Martin Scorcese may have had his eye on The Ring when he directed the fight scenes in Raging Bull as his watchword for these scenes was Stay inside the ring. The fight in The Ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots but when the action intensifies Hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it with closeups and pointofview shots. Hitchcock's aim always seems to have been to involve his audience and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the character's fear or paranoia.The Ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known The Lodger. It's a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture and probably the best of all his silent features.".

	schema:headline " good early effort from Hitchcock";
	schema:reviewBody "Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original screenplays written by Hitchcock himself this film shows remarkable story structure. It kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ One Round Jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter. The movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack his girl and the professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men this time for the heavyweight crown. Even in this early film Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement.

	onyx:emotionText "Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original screenplays written by Hitchcock himself this film shows remarkable story structure. It kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ One Round Jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter. The movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack his girl and the professional boxer. The rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men this time for the heavyweight crown.

The sound editing is frequently sloppy and the sound quality varies widely but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here.This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest.

There is a lot of visual detail and symbolism that add meaning to a basically routine story about smalltime boxer Jack his girl and the champion who gives Jack his big break but who also tries to steal his girl.The opening sequence establishes the triangle amidst the colorful atmosphere of a traveling show where Jack takes on all comers inside a tent.  It is filled with a lot of detail especially the bracelet that Bob the champion gives to Jack's girl which is important as a plot element and as a symbol. This ring is one of several meanings of the film's nicelychosen title. Most of the plot that follows is predictable as it is clear from the beginning that someday Bob and Jack will have to square off in the ring with more than Bob's title at stake.  But if the story is routine Hitchcock's technique is not.  There are a lot of creative touches that develop the characters and story and that add humor and interest.  The cast is pretty good and some of the secondary characters from the traveling show are very funny in the earlier scenes.This is certainly an oldfashioned movie and won't be of general interest today but it's a nice little film.

When onlooker Bob Corby is reluctantly talked into going a round with Jack he knocks him out much to Jack's dismay and surprise.

Although relatively littleseen compared to some of the popular boxing movies Hitchcock's silent has undoubtedly had a great impact of the sport genre especially on Scorsese's Raging Bull. Hitchcock was fascinated with boxing  the idea of a physical and mental duel between two gladiators and also with the dirty feel of the arena.

	schema:headline " Fun With Circular Objects";
	schema:reviewBody "The fact this is Alfred Hitchcock's one sports movie may along with it being a silent film may put some Hitch fans off. That's too bad because The Ring presents a solid blend of romantic intrigue and comedy that shows the young director beginning to master his craft. Whatever your interest in the Master going in it's worth a view.One Round Jack Sadler makes a decent living as a fairground pugilist his gimmick being if a customer can last a round with him they get a prize. Few enough do so that Sadler can plan on marrying his sweetheart Mabel Lilian HallDavies the ring's ticket collector. But he's about to get a rude awakening when the big time comes calling in the form of Australian heavyweight champ Bob Corby Ian Hunter who likes Sadler's style but likes Mabel even more.Hitchcock makes you feel the sweat and sawdust of the fair in setting up the opening scene. He also does a clever thing with introducing Corby as someone who looks out of place and is apparently gulled into facing OneRound by Mabel's coy glances and comehither gestures. You actually worry for the guy until you and OneRound get the first of many surprises in this crafty movie.The title of the film means several things including the boxing ring OneRound's wedding ring and an arm bracelet that Corby gives to Mabel for which she shows much affection. There's also a ring of cards a spinning record glasses of champagne and a horseshoe that falls on a fortune teller's head angering her to throw up some early sparks. Hitch has a lot of fun playing with these and other optics like pointofview shots of besotted partiers.He also gets a great performance from Brisson who doesn't overact nearly as much as he did in Hitchcock's later The Manxman but instead plays his scenes with a balance of sympathetic hurt and anger not to mention the natural physical gifts of a reallife boxer. He projects a quality of amiable menace that moves us into his corner against the sly Corby whom Hunter underplays very well. When we see Mabel and OneRound marry there's a quick cut to Corby letting out a yawn that tells us everything we need to know about the character. Mabel may care for him but the feeling is only returned in a casual opportunistic way.The major weakness is Mabel. HallDavies does solid work with what she's given but it's hard to care for someone as fickle as she. To the extent we do it's because OneRound's happiness is tied exclusively to her affections. I wish the script Hitch's only solo effort in his film career did more with the ambiguity of her character. Designing women were a forte of Hitchcock's but later on.Still this is a classy fastmoving picture that gives us much flavor for the period and the sweet science in grittier days. You get plenty of fun moments many of them from Gordon Harker as OneRound's dogged grubby trainer. He serves a thematic purpose too. When we see him as best man at the wedding picking his nose before handing the minister the ring you have to wonder who would want to touch that thing. Something of that sordidness carries through the rest of the film.The climax won't surprise many but it's still great entertainment delivered with a visceral quality that puts you in the ring with One Round in the fight of his life. Like jennyhor2004 says in her September 2012 review this is a film for Hitch fans to see their man crafting his signature style but even without the name on the title The Ring makes for a worthy entry in the film canon silent or otherwise. There are finer boxing films even silent ones Buster Keaton's Battling Butler for one but The Ring stands up to the punches of time quite well.".

That's too bad because The Ring presents a solid blend of romantic intrigue and comedy that shows the young director beginning to master his craft. Whatever your interest in the Master going in it's worth a view.One Round Jack Sadler makes a decent living as a fairground pugilist his gimmick being if a customer can last a round with him they get a prize. Few enough do so that Sadler can plan on marrying his sweetheart Mabel Lilian HallDavies the ring's ticket collector. But he's about to get a rude awakening when the big time comes calling in the form of Australian heavyweight champ Bob Corby Ian Hunter who likes Sadler's style but likes Mabel even more.Hitchcock makes you feel the sweat and sawdust of the fair in setting up the opening scene. He also does a clever thing with introducing Corby as someone who looks out of place and is apparently gulled into facing OneRound by Mabel's coy glances and comehither gestures. You actually worry for the guy until you and OneRound get the first of many surprises in this crafty movie.The title of the film means several things including the boxing ring OneRound's wedding ring and an arm bracelet that Corby gives to Mabel for which she shows much affection. There's also a ring of cards a spinning record glasses of champagne and a horseshoe that falls on a fortune teller's head angering her to throw up some early sparks. Hitch has a lot of fun playing with these and other optics like pointofview shots of besotted partiers.He also gets a great performance from Brisson who doesn't overact nearly as much as he did in Hitchcock's later The Manxman but instead plays his scenes with a balance of sympathetic hurt and anger not to mention the natural physical gifts of a reallife boxer. He projects a quality of amiable menace that moves us into his corner against the sly Corby whom Hunter underplays very well. When we see Mabel and OneRound marry there's a quick cut to Corby letting out a yawn that tells us everything we need to know about the character. Mabel may care for him but the feeling is only returned in a casual opportunistic way.The major weakness is Mabel. HallDavies does solid work with what she's given but it's hard to care for someone as fickle as she. To the extent we do it's because OneRound's happiness is tied exclusively to her affections. I wish the script Hitch's only solo effort in his film career did more with the ambiguity of her character. Designing women were a forte of Hitchcock's but later on.Still this is a classy fastmoving picture that gives us much flavor for the period and the sweet science in grittier days. You get plenty of fun moments many of them from Gordon Harker as OneRound's dogged grubby trainer. He serves a thematic purpose too. When we see him as best man at the wedding picking his nose before handing the minister the ring you have to wonder who would want to touch that thing. Something of that sordidness carries through the rest of the film.The climax won't surprise many but it's still great entertainment delivered with a visceral quality that puts you in the ring with One Round in the fight of his life. Like jennyhor2004 says in her September 2012 review this is a film for Hitch fans to see their man crafting his signature style but even without the name on the title The Ring makes for a worthy entry in the film canon silent or otherwise. There are finer boxing films even silent ones Buster Keaton's Battling Butler for one but The Ring stands up to the punches of time quite well.";

As an almost brand new director there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why Hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career.Granted the film does start with among other things the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer and I use idiot in the definitive manner the way Stephen King so often does having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people. I suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then but I think it is one of the most offputting sequences in any Hitchcock film I've seen.The main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round but when he meets his match it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife's finger. So begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly.spoilers There is for example a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and just before going into the building she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss. This kiss is never explained and there is also the fact that even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband or at least ultimately chooses him they look into each other's eyes but do not actually kiss.The film is certainly beautifully photographed even more so than several films that Hitch released in subsequent years. There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as One Round Jack's trainer who in his stone faced expressionism reminds me quite often of the brilliant Buster Keaton. Hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous but this is a great sample of his early work.".

	schema:headline " A rare Hitchcock sports movie about a love triangle";
	schema:reviewBody "An early triumph for the young Alfred Hitchcock released in the same year as his better known The Lodger A Story of the London Fog the boxing film The Ring deserves its own accolade as one of his more technically accomplished films from the silent movie era. Already the film features much symbolism in its name alone there is the obvious reference to the boxing ring but the title also refers to a wedding ring a bracelet and the love triangle that is the movie's heart. Themes familiar to Hitchcock fans are not so much in evidence here and the major attractions lie in Hitchcock's increasingly confident use of editing montage the camera as voyeur and development of character through action and emotion.Jack Sander Carl Brisson works his way up as a boxer from fighting amateurs at country fairs to professional level. His main ambition is to succeed at boxing and earn enough money to marry the cashier Mabel Lillian Hall Davis. However Mabel meets another boxer Bob Corby Ian Hunter and falls in love with him. As Sander wins his bouts he marries Mabel and continues to fight but gradually discovers his wife is still attracted to Bob. He vows to keep on fighting to a level where he can seriously challenge Corby. Eventually the match is arranged and everyone in town turns up to watch the match. Can Gander beat Corby and win back Mabel? Who will Mabel choose?The story is hokey in its details but Hitchcock was more interested in the love triangle and the characterisation of Mabel the most developed character than in portraying boxing as a career in the 1920s. It's a given in many of Hitchcock's films that the main female character should be the most complex of the cast no matter what the plot and The Ring is no different here. Mabel is torn between the shallow funloving lifestyle that Corby as an established professional boxer can offer her and the plainer downtoearth and genuine life that is Jack's to give. The inner conflict that Mabel experiences is most vividly expressed in the climactic boxing scene where she is seen racing from Corby's side to Jack's side and back again. Hall Davis is quite effective as Mabel and has a lovely beauty in several shots. Unfortunately her career in films was shortlived the arrival of talkies cut short her success and she committed suicide in 1933. Brisson brings to his role an imposing physical presence and height and experience as an amateur boxer he's not much of an actor but he has a frank and open sincerity that makes him perfect as a wronged man. Ian Hunter as Corby hasn't much to do apart from playing suave and seductive he was to have a long film career that lasted nearly 40 years.The film shows German Expressionist influences in a number of scenes and although the plot can be quite involved it is skilfully relayed so as to rely on very few titles cards and the flow of the narrative is not disrupted as a result. Throughout his career Hitchcock never forgot his roots in silent film and a number of his later movies even famous ones made in the late 1950s and early 1960s like Vertigo North by Northwest and Psycho feature extended scenes where nothing is said. The boxing scene where Sander and Corby settle their differences once and for all uses clever edits and a dreamlike sequence simulating the effect of slight concussion to draw out and heighten the inner and outer conflicts of the two men they are fighting not only for their reputations and careers they are fighting for the love of a woman. There are scenes throughout the film where the camera is used as a voyeuristic device that lets us see how the rivalry between Sander and Corby develops and escalates.It is a slow film in its first half and doesn't accumulate pace and tension until Mabel's adultery with Corby becomes overt and Sander's anger at her betrayal threatens to get the better of him. Minor characters such as Sander's trainer provide light relief and pause in the tension. Overall The Ring is recommended to Hitchcock fans to see how their favourite director was refining his signature style.".

From being raw and enthusiastic Jack is almost knocked out  then between rounds reuniting with Mabel gives him the courage to triumph. The question is why would he even want her back  from the start she thought nothing of starting an affair with Bob  why wouldn't she do it again?The film is loaded with symbolism. Jack shaking hands with the promoter changes to Mabel's hands accepting a bracelet from Bob. When Jack puts the ring on Mabel's finger Bobs bracelet slips down her arm. At the end Jack sees Mabel's reflection in a ringside water bucket and that gives him the confidence to go on. This is an excellent film that will not disappoint you.Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "'OneRound' Jack Sander is called that because he's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience. If they can last one round they win a prizea popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago. Jack is in love with the ticket girl Mabel though her head is quickly turned when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack. What no one at the fight knows is that Bob is the champ so he's able to beat Jackthough it takes him some work. As a result Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit. Later Jack improves so much that he too becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly he works his way up the rankings until he's nearly ready to take on the Champ.In the meantime the Champ and Mabel start running around behind Jack's backeven though by now Mabel has married Jack. So when the final fight occurs between Jack and Bob it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will rise justifiable rage against Bob help or hinder his performance?

In fact in many ways this film is more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents THE MANXMAN also starring Carl Brisson as the wronged husband. So while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day it was not a radical departure for this great directoreven with its rather formulaic ending.Overall while a bit predictable and having Ian Hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly the film works well.

	onyx:emotionText "'OneRound' Jack Sander is called that because he's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience. If they can last one round they win a prizea popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago. Jack is in love with the ticket girl Mabel though her head is quickly turned when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack. What no one at the fight knows is that Bob is the champ so he's able to beat Jackthough it takes him some work. As a result Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit. Later Jack improves so much that he too becomes a legitimate boxer. Slowly he works his way up the rankings until he's nearly ready to take on the Champ.In the meantime the Champ and Mabel start running around behind Jack's backeven though by now Mabel has married Jack. So when the final fight occurs between Jack and Bob it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will rise justifiable rage against Bob help or hinder his performance? Tune in and see.This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mysterysuspense films back in the 1920s Hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote he did both for this film.

There are some overlong irrelevant scenes and some sloppy sound but The Ring is a good silent film that is more than just interest value. It is well made with great clever use of editing and camera work evidence of Hitchcock's distinctive style coming in even early in his career and some very powerful symbolic images that are open to interpretation in some way. The music is very fitting and wellsynchronised to everything else particularly good in the final boxing match. Hitchcock also writes as well as directs he directs with a very assured touch and he takes care in making the characters identifiable and not making the melodrama and lovetriangle too hammy or turgid. The final boxing match is very exciting getting increasingly rapid and intense helped by it being it cleverly edited and scored. In a way though the film does end on a slightly anticlimatic note. The acting is very good Carl Brisson is excellent even and Lillian HallDavies is charming and graceful. Ian Hunter is a strong commanding opponent and Gordon Harker brings some welltimed comic relief. In conclusion interesting watch and a good film in general. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "The Ring is a silent film about a love story shaped around boxing. 'One Round' Jack Sander is in love with a woman named Mabel and the two of them decide to get married. Jack is a very skilled boxer but one day he loses a fight to a man named Bob Corby at which point Mabel also starts to fall for Bob. As Jack learns more and more about Mabel's affair he attempts to work his way back up to the top in a boxing tournament. And in the end he believes that the fight with Bob will determine Mabel's love. So it's actually a pretty decent story about love which surprisingly works very well with the boxing aspect of the film.The acting is very good here with Carl Brisson doing an excellent job as Jack. He looks as concerned as anyone ever could about his wife and he truly looks motivated to make his way to the top in boxing. Ian Hunter does a great job as Bob the rich boxer who also tries to get Mabel. Now Mabel is played by Lillian HallDavis who also happens to do a truly excellent job. All of the minor roles in the film are also catered to perfectly.Each of the sets in the film are done pretty well with the carnival at the beginning and all of the boxing rings looking pretty realistic for the time. The hits between boxers are very good for the most part as it usually looks like they are actually making contact. The musical score for this film is one of the best that I've ever heard in a silent film and it truly leaves the viewer with a wide variety of emotions.With all of the praise that I just rained upon this film you may think that I'm going to say go out and see this film immediately but in reality it feels like less than the sum of its parts. The story is very good while not perfect the acting is excellent the special effects are pretty good and the music is truly stupendous. So not everything in the film is perfect but there really aren't that many noteworthy flaws. I'll say check out the film if you enjoy boxing love stories or Alfred Hitchcock. Score 710".

Apparently it didn't do much for the audiences in 1927 either because from what I've been able to find out about it despite being popular with critics it sank at the box office. Hitchcock not only directed but also wrote this boring melodrama a combination of two of my least favourite genres boxing and romance. The world of boxing provides the backdrop for this formulaic triangle between two competitors and the girl who loves them both but which man does she really want to marry? The title is good with several layered meanings in relation to the story. The fact that the film used few title cards was unique letting visuals tell the story by themselves. There are a lot of clever visuals by Hitchcock as we look up through the water of a pond at the two lovers placing the ring on her finger at the marriage ceremony only to have the bracelet slip down to her wrist reminding her and the audience of the other man girl sitting on hubby's lap glances across the room toward a mirror and sees reflection of the other man fingers flittering away on the ivories distorted  but the plot again written by Hitchcock himself was a routine melodrama which could hardly hold my attention.Beautiful slightly Gothic looking church in which the ceremony occurs is an asset to the film in its few brief scenes. Goofball comically blowing the suds off the beer then downing it and the film's subsequent distorted PointOfView shot is an amusing moment. Was this film released October 1927 the first to use POV shots?".

Ian Hunter is great as the cocky boxing champion on the prowl to make a conquest of another man's wife. It helps that this is a silent and we can't hear Hunter's distinctive voice. I can't imagine him playing this kind of part during his Hollywood years. Carl Brisson does a tremendous job making you feel for his character. Lillian HallDavis is probably the weakest part of the cast but her character isn't the most wellwritten or likable so maybe not all the blame rests on her performance.It's a good film although not for all tastes. The romance is a tough sell as is usually the case with love triangle stories. It's pretty straightforward and the basic theme is kind of timeless even if the way in which its presented may seem dated to some viewers today. The fight scenes are exciting and as with most Hitchcock silents it's a very attractivelooking film. Also worth a look for some behindthescenes windowintothepast stuff about early 20th century prizefighting in England.".

Though he means money Bob Corby Hunter is interested in the ticket seller Mabel HallDavis who just so happens to be Jack's fiance. Corby who's with his promoter James Ware Forrester Harvey is the Australian boxing champion though he doesn't let this be known when he accepts the barker's offer.Naturally Corby wins the bout with Jack in Round 4 upsetting Jack's trainer Gordon Harker. However after the fight Ware offers Jack the opportunity to be Corby's training partner which Jack and his trainer readily accept. Meanwhile unbeknownst to Jack his fiance Mabel has been kissing Corby. But after Jack wins a tuneup fight to earn the right to be Corby's training partner he and Mabel are married. The charming playboy Corby who's in attendance doesn't seem to mind.Their marriage is a sham though with Mabel spending all her time in the company of the champ Corby. After preventing a scene a premature fight in a restaurant between his two fighters Ware promises Jack the opportunity to fight for his wife provided he can climb the rankings and earn a title fight with Corby.So in typical boxing film fashion Jack's name moves up the boxing card until he finally wins the bout which secures his shot at Corby. When he returns home to celebrate with his old friends including the barker and his trainer Jack is surprised for some reason that Mabel isn't there to congratulate him. Eventually while they all wait for her return Jack's friends leave. When Mabel finally does return the couple finally has a falling out with Mabel leaving Jack to stay with friends.The bout between Jack and Corby dominates the film's final scenes. Naturally Mabel is there to watch. The fight goes several rounds and it appears as if Jack is down and out. However Mabel rushes to his corner between rounds and tells her husband that she's on his side. This of course inspires Jack to beat Corby and win the fight. After the bout is over though Mabel and Corby exchange a knowing wink.There are some scenes which would be deemed racist today the ridiculing of a black man at the carnival's dunking booth and even the use of the nword on one placard. The film's title is a 'triple' entendre referring to the boxing ring the wedding ring and a golden bracelet given by Corby to Mabel.".

The charming playboy Corby who's in attendance doesn't seem to mind.Their marriage is a sham though with Mabel spending all her time in the company of the champ Corby. After preventing a scene a premature fight in a restaurant between his two fighters Ware promises Jack the opportunity to fight for his wife provided he can climb the rankings and earn a title fight with Corby.So in typical boxing film fashion Jack's name moves up the boxing card until he finally wins the bout which secures his shot at Corby. When he returns home to celebrate with his old friends including the barker and his trainer Jack is surprised for some reason that Mabel isn't there to congratulate him. Eventually while they all wait for her return Jack's friends leave. When Mabel finally does return the couple finally has a falling out with Mabel leaving Jack to stay with friends.The bout between Jack and Corby dominates the film's final scenes. Naturally Mabel is there to watch. The fight goes several rounds and it appears as if Jack is down and out. However Mabel rushes to his corner between rounds and tells her husband that she's on his side. This of course inspires Jack to beat Corby and win the fight. After the bout is over though Mabel and Corby exchange a knowing wink.There are some scenes which would be deemed racist today the ridiculing of a black man at the carnival's dunking booth and even the use of the nword on one placard. The film's title is a 'triple' entendre referring to the boxing ring the wedding ring and a golden bracelet given by Corby to Mabel.";

Many years prior to this incident a group of eminent scientists led by Dr. Jeremy Stone Arthur Hill advocated for the construction of a secure laboratory facility that would serve as a base in the event an alien biological life form was returned to Earth from a space mission. Stone and his team  Drs. Dutton Leavitt and Hall David Wayne Kate Reid and James Olson respectively go to the facility known as Wildfire and try to first isolate the life form while determining why two people from Piedmont an old wino and a sixmonthold baby survived. The scientists methodically study the alien life form unaware that it has already mutated and presents a far greater danger in the lab which is equipped with a nuclear selfdestruct device should it manage to escape.";

Actually all the details that mark every scientific thriller by Crichton are there in the film. The Andromeda Strain doesn't have any dinosaurs it only has a small virus but overall it is a much better film than any of the Jurassic Parks.

	schema:headline " Great hardcore scifi. Crichton's best";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1970s were a time before some of the intelligentsia of American culture began to abandon rationality and reject science on pseudoethical grounds. Unsurprisingly then 1970s scifi is often better informed by science than the scifi of later decades and it is also often more thoughtful and intelligently written. The Andromeda Strain is one of the best hardcore sci fi epics from a decade which brought us such genre classics as 2001 Solyaris Silent Running and the original Rollerball. Unlike most of these films however Andromeda Strain does not strain believability beyond its bounds nor does it indulge in metaphysical tangentializing or philosophical moralizing.Developed from what I consider to be Michael Crichton's best book the Andromeda Strain takes its cue directly from the hard realism of that book along with its documentary style and scientific background research. Though aspects of the plot defy biological probability if not law almost the entire film is plausible. Also borrowed from Crichton's writing is the general point the film attempts to make  one which is present in nearly all of Crichton's work  that along with technological advance comes risk. Fortunately however this story does not reach the nearparanoid levels of technophobia which sometimes appear in later works.A great ensemble cast full of not easily recognized character actors represent a team of scientists called together to contain and manage a deadly viruslike organism which has arrived on a crashed space research probe. The virus has already wiped out an entire town and now the scientists must work at a breakneck sleepless pace to determine what the organism is how it spreads and grows and how it can be killed or contained. Their only major clues it seems are an old man and a baby who survived the initial outbreak. To avoid spoilers I will avoid any further details regarding the plot.The only aspect of the film which really seems dated is the strange electronic soundtrack which at times seems more derivative of 1950s scifi than more modern stuff. Suffice to say that this is one of the best uses of the 'asithappens' documentary filmmaking style. The entire film is delivered in a very refreshingly straightforward manner with believable dialog actors that look like real people and a pace that builds constantly from start to finish.Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " They wouldn't make it today";
	schema:reviewBody "It reminds me a bit of The Forbin Project in that it presents us with a puzzle that needs solving by intellectual means and with a problem that has momentous overtones.  They wouldn't make it today.  Look at the cast. Arthur HILL?  Kate REID?  They'd need DeCaprio and Roberts at least.  And angstrom units?  And not a single gun or punch in the mouth?  And the bomb doesn't EXPLODE?  No no no  all wrong.Well the movie IS dated true but not in ways that count.  I can handle the fact that clerks still use typewriters instead of PCs.  I can live with the awe that is supposed to be instilled in us when we watch somebody use the mechanical hands.  And the references to love ins and SDS and protest marches and the notion that the collection of deadly organisms from space may have been deliberately carried out by the DOD.  I forget who objected to that implication but I don't find it the least implausible not anymore.  The story proceeds logically step by step through the introduction of the characters with Kate Reid providing some welcome ThelmaRittertype comic relief the introduction of the organism if that's the proper word and the identification of its nature.  Never for a moment does the script lapse into mumbojumbo.  We're never lost.  We always know who's doing what and why.  And in the age of ebola AIDS and SARS I think we can forget about the fact that some of the technology is dated because the issue certainly isn't.On the other hand I wish the end had never come because the movie completely implodes during its last ten minutes or so by deus ex machina.

	onyx:emotionText "It reminds me a bit of The Forbin Project in that it presents us with a puzzle that needs solving by intellectual means and with a problem that has momentous overtones.  They wouldn't make it today.  Look at the cast. Arthur HILL?  Kate REID?  They'd need DeCaprio and Roberts at least.  And angstrom units?  And not a single gun or punch in the mouth?  And the bomb doesn't EXPLODE?  No no no  all wrong.Well the movie IS dated true but not in ways that count.  I can handle the fact that clerks still use typewriters instead of PCs.  I can live with the awe that is supposed to be instilled in us when we watch somebody use the mechanical hands.  And the references to love ins and SDS and protest marches and the notion that the collection of deadly organisms from space may have been deliberately carried out by the DOD.  I forget who objected to that implication but I don't find it the least implausible not anymore.  The story proceeds logically step by step through the introduction of the characters with Kate Reid providing some welcome ThelmaRittertype comic relief the introduction of the organism if that's the proper word and the identification of its nature.  Never for a moment does the script lapse into mumbojumbo.  We're never lost.  We always know who's doing what and why.  And in the age of ebola AIDS and SARS I think we can forget about the fact that some of the technology is dated because the issue certainly isn't.On the other hand I wish the end had never come because the movie completely implodes during its last ten minutes or so by deus ex machina. I mean here these guys are working like hell to solve a problem and when they're just about to do it the problem goes away by itself and is completely forgotten.

For the record the rest are Westworld' The First Great Train Robbery' Disclosure' Jurassic Park' Twister' and Congo' although I've never made it to the end of Congo'. Does this say something about Crichton's career or the state of filmmaking or neither?  Can't say.Whatever  this is pretty darned good science fiction.  Sure it has the vices we've come to expect scientists with a tendency to act like the crew of the Enterprise and central protagonists who begin the film by swimming through treacle and end it by leaping tall buildings in a single bound.  As for the former problem well it's not so bad here as it usually is.  As for the latter well it's easy to forgive because we're put through a very tense ride before our heroes crawl out of the treacle   even afterwards. They don't make films this tense these days.  Or at least this particular film would have been less tense if it had been made these days.  I don't think a modern director would have resisted the temptation to goof off at some point.THAT'S part of the charm.  The film's idea of how scientists behave is rather a silly one but at least the scientists aren't forced to act GOOFY in order to show that scientists are really human after all  as if there was any need to show this.  And I'll say this whatever the scientists were like the SCIENCE is much more intelligent than a modern public has any right to expect.  So far as I could tell not that I'm an expert in anything it only stretches into fantasy when it needs to.  Wise gives us information and plenty of it  not technobabble.I've heard people snicker at the thirtyyearold look of the film but I think they're nuts.  The art direction is wonderful.  In a way it does the same thing as the original Star Trek it creates a coherent claustrophobic world by force of sheer simplicity.  But to see The Andromeda Strain' is to see it done WELL.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on Michael Crichton's first novel THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN released in 1971 is a long but constantly intriguing science fiction drama whose concerns verge very close to science fact.The movie concerns a satellite that crashes back to Earth carrying with it an unknown but deadly organism.  All but two a drunk and an infant of the sixtyeight residents of the tiny town of Piedmont New Mexico have been killed by the organism.  It is up to a team of scientists working at an underground lab in the Nevada desert known as Wildfire to study and if possible eliminate the bug.Arthur Hill David Wayne James Olson and Kate Reid are the quartet of scientists who are given the task to learn more about this space organism. At Wildfire they have all the equipment they could possibly need including a nuclear device that is set to go off should the lab become contaminated. They learn however that the bug codenamed Andromeda actually works like a reactor changing matter into energy and vice versa.  This means that the nuclear device meant to destroy it would only enhance it and spread it all over so that the human race will never be rid of it.The nightmare they feared comes true as Wildfire becomes contaminated. With only a fiveminute delay between activation and selfdestruction Olson is given the task to get to a shutoff switch.  He struggles but manages to prevent the unthinkable...with eight seconds to spare.Brilliantly directed by Robert Wise whose 1951 film THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is one of the genre's all time greats THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is highly entertaining and strikingly intelligent with a suspenseful climax.  The four lead actors neither of whom were big names do extremely good work giving this film a realism not found in many other films of the genre.  The Wildfire lab is as accurate and realistic as anything today's production designers could come up with.  Furthermore the technology doesn't seem too terribly dated despite the film's obvious age.  This is because of the innovative special effects work of Douglas Trumbull 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY James Shourt and Albert Whitlock THE BIRDS.Rated 'G' though 'PG' would be more accurate some scenes are frightening THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN remains a significant film of the scifi genre as it confronts the increasing realities about biological war and contamination. Dated or not it is a very prescient piece.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember watching this film for the first time late one night with my father and younger brother.  I was five years old I already knew I was going to be a scientist and I was riveted to the show.  The next day I demanded that my mother take me to the library to check out the book. Despite having seen the movie I read the novel with as much excitement and anticipation as I watched the film.  I questioned every adult I knew who had any sort of science or medical background about the ideas I found in the story.For someone who considers selfawareness intelligence and rational thought the defining and redeeming qualities of humanity and the scientific method from chipping stone tools to putting a man on the moon the single greatest achievement of humanity thus far it has always appeared to me that the arts have been overwhelmingly negative in their portrayal of science.  The mad scientist and the evils of scientific progress the superiority and 'humaneness' of emotionalism and impulsiveness over rational thought and diligence all are staples of Western culture.The Andromeda Strain is different it is realistic in that good and evil are identified with people and their motivations.  However it is used science is powerful as a tool for learning understanding and interacting with nature.  Wildfire the facility where a cure for Andromeda is sought we learn was actually built for darker purposes.  Despite that it serves to help the team of scientists understand a radically different form of life a form of life with a unique origin.  The characters of the scientists also are real people brilliant in their areas of knowledge yet bearing characters flaws.  In the end despite arrogance irresponsibility quarrelsomeness it is their passion to learn to understand to solve a significant and meaningful problem which overcomes their flaws and focuses their talents.I remember this movie fondly and watched it any time it came on TV before the era of video tape.  I still have an oftenread paperback copy of the novel.  I recently viewed the movie on video and highly recommend it. There are a few isolated sections which are dated but they don't harm the film.  Since the film wasn't attempting to be futuristic I actually enjoy seeing the advanced technology of the time and contrasting that with current technology.  The special effects are still welldone.  The scientific realism is due mainly to Chrichton however Wise deserves credit for keeping faithful to the novel.  He doesn't add layers of glittery pseudotechnology and technobabble.If you want to inspire a young scientist or engineer or simply offer some counterbalance to all the scienceisevil sentiment that saturates both information and entertainment media read the novel then watch the movie. Show them that challenge and excitement can be found in constructive collaborative and intellectual activities.  I am doing that now with each of my children when they have all read the novel we're going to have an Andromeda Strain party and watch the movie together.

	onyx:emotionText "I remember watching this film for the first time late one night with my father and younger brother.  I was five years old I already knew I was going to be a scientist and I was riveted to the show.  The next day I demanded that my mother take me to the library to check out the book. Despite having seen the movie I read the novel with as much excitement and anticipation as I watched the film.  I questioned every adult I knew who had any sort of science or medical background about the ideas I found in the story.For someone who considers selfawareness intelligence and rational thought the defining and redeeming qualities of humanity and the scientific method from chipping stone tools to putting a man on the moon the single greatest achievement of humanity thus far it has always appeared to me that the arts have been overwhelmingly negative in their portrayal of science.  The mad scientist and the evils of scientific progress the superiority and 'humaneness' of emotionalism and impulsiveness over rational thought and diligence all are staples of Western culture.The Andromeda Strain is different it is realistic in that good and evil are identified with people and their motivations.  However it is used science is powerful as a tool for learning understanding and interacting with nature.  Wildfire the facility where a cure for Andromeda is sought we learn was actually built for darker purposes.  Despite that it serves to help the team of scientists understand a radically different form of life a form of life with a unique origin.  The characters of the scientists also are real people brilliant in their areas of knowledge yet bearing characters flaws.  In the end despite arrogance irresponsibility quarrelsomeness it is their passion to learn to understand to solve a significant and meaningful problem which overcomes their flaws and focuses their talents.I remember this movie fondly and watched it any time it came on TV before the era of video tape.  I still have an oftenread paperback copy of the novel.  I recently viewed the movie on video and highly recommend it. There are a few isolated sections which are dated but they don't harm the film.  Since the film wasn't attempting to be futuristic I actually enjoy seeing the advanced technology of the time and contrasting that with current technology.  The special effects are still welldone.  The scientific realism is due mainly to Chrichton however Wise deserves credit for keeping faithful to the novel.  He doesn't add layers of glittery pseudotechnology and technobabble.If you want to inspire a young scientist or engineer or simply offer some counterbalance to all the scienceisevil sentiment that saturates both information and entertainment media read the novel then watch the movie. Show them that challenge and excitement can be found in constructive collaborative and intellectual activities.  I am doing that now with each of my children when they have all read the novel we're going to have an Andromeda Strain party and watch the movie together.  We'll discuss what parts were realistic the social questions at issue when the movie was made biological warfare the space program the beginnings of genetic engineering and what science it actually about.  I hope it will be as inspirational to them as it was for me.";

As others have told the storyline I will not waste your time be regurgitating it.  The one change of Dr. Leavitt from male to female improves the film IMO.  It also adds some great humor.  It's also enjoyable to see scientists that look like scientists not hot studs and big breasted bimbos.  The story is realistic and as I said a perfect adaptation of his novel.  My only complaint is the thrown in narration explaining the piece of paper that had caused the machine to not ring its bell when the new messages came in.  Other than that it's a fabulous film.    I was able to get one of the few remaining copies of the now outofprint DVD widescreen version Go to an auction site and get it if you can..  Highly recommended!".

It's not a lowbrow action movie but an intelligent scifi thriller about a microbiological crisis initiated by an extraterrestrial! virus brought to earth by a space probe made long before Outbreak and the like. Fine acting and the thorough recreation of the scientific procedures described in Michael Crichton's novel on which the movie is based make this a first choice for viewers with an interest in scifi with more than a slight touch of reality. Hints at U. S. plans for biological warfare near the end also make this a political thriller of sorts! Only drawback The colors appear a bit pale nowadays as is the case with many 70's films but since most of the scenes are set in a sterile monotonous laboratory environment this doesn't spoil one's viewing experience. Watch out for the eerie opening sequence set in a small desert town where everyone was killed by the Alien virus except for an old drunkard and a baby!".

I haven't read the book but I remember what a phenomenon the movie was to kids of my age in 1971 I was 11. This movie gets played to death on cable here but I always end up watching parts of it even though I have it on DVD.What strikes me about the comments though is that nearly everyone describes it as dated as if in 1971 people should have known to use touch screens and the like. This is the first instance that I know of which used sciencefact technology instead of sciencefiction projection to tell the story and as such that's what made it so chilling. It's the grounding in things like typewriterbased computers that made it seem so real.In fact the production design is the true star of this movie as the story slowly leads us into the sterile spacestationlike world of the underground laboratory. We're taken on a tour of the Wildfire facility and each step is explained methodically and in detail in terms that the audience could relate to and yet still feel like it was a newly expanding universe.Such movies not only seemed entirely plausible in 1971 but also managed to condition us ordinary folks into the spaceage notions that anything was possible in both positive and negative terms. It was a time when we had just landed on the moon when computers were the size of rooms and the economy hadn't yet crashed but there was still great fear of the unknown. What if those moon rocks they brought back carried a virus that could wipe out all living things on Earth? That question was what prompted Crichton to write the original novel I would suspect.There's no doubt that Andromeda Strain owes a great deal to 2001 and it recycles that movie's slowness and fascination with sterile technology in a more mainstream style. I enjoy how Robert Wise looks for ways to open up his movies and I rarely mind the oldman sensibility he brings to so many of his later films. The fact that the principles in this are so unglamorous is a very smart and completely appropriate solution. It makes it all the more realistic in that Robert Wise sort of simulated reality. He really deserves a lot of credit for the sheer variety of films he directed. I think he was a national treasure.In retrospect it's great that this film holds up so well and is a tribute to Wise's carefully modulated sense of humor taste and style. Just trying to watch a few seconds of the remake demonstrates how subtlety and nuance and smart old people can trump pretty hacks at any time.".

Kathleen Turner his costar here played a similar role in another black comedy Serial Mom. There too she played a woman who appeared to be nice on the outside but was evil inside. Turner also liked to show a lot of skin in those '80s flicks which included Body Heat.I had remembered this as a strictly light comedy but was surprised when I viewed it again this year and heard all the sex jokes. Reiner turned out to be a dirty old man but he write and direct some very funny movies. It's unusual for a comedy to be rated R but that was the appropriate rating.

	schema:reviewBody "This is most indeed Steve Martin's second most wackiest comedy after The Jerk. Everything about this movie has zip craze and certain kind of frantic in the pace which makes for an absouloutley lovable comedy. The story centers round Dr Michael Hfuhruhurr Steve Martin spelt Haffar he is most probaly the worlds greatest brain surgeon he is rich and famous. But Michael has emotional problems and his wife died some time ago though lucky Michael ends up meeting the evil sexy and seductive Delores Kathleen Turner who is a gold digging Scum queen. They supposedly fall in love and get married though Michael sensing some problems  thinks it is going down hill and thinks a honey moon to Europe would help and so he and Delores go. The Man With Two Brains has two stories one involves what I said above and another takes place around Europe where Michael ends up falling in love with his research a human brain! It is Romeo and Juliet as their love is forbiden and Michael goes to extreme lengths to ensure they remain in each others arms okay that was a bad excuse. What makes The Man With Two Brains so great is the colourful eighties eneergetic look that adds the crazy wack to the movie. There are many comedic sets in the movie e.g the condo scenes in Hfuhrhurr 's hospital. Any movie in  which Steve Martin stars is bound to be watchable but what Martin did back here was he would overact a lot more he would not do his everyman thing he is indeed crazy his eyes in this movie shows a locked up genius with a crazy edge. The character of Hfuhruhurr is a very unlikeable person but with Martin playing him he is the good guy he makes you want to come out of this with his loved one. Kathleen Turner is also a comic delight as she does a little micky take of Body Heat. Screen play wise this is also one of Martin's best as it is witty and full of excellent scenarios. As with any classic comedy there has to be a funny scene that stands above the rest the scene at the beginning in the car is excellent Hfuhrhurr Can you tell me what you wrote I believe I may have sounded snobbish? Interviwer My research is the some of the greastest the world has ever seen and in that way will proably so ever plant my reputation as a great proffesor for all eterntity HfuhrhurrNo it didn't sound snobbish... Take out the probably though. Makes me sound wishy washy. Now that is excellent Martin he does it with every film not everyody would get that. Another hilarious thing about this movie is it's music it is so corny and cheesy but without sounding annoying it is just plain funny. Bottom line is this is one of Martin's landmark films a film which has visula look brilliant pacing trademark manic peformance by Martin and memorbale scenes that stick in the mind. Absoloutley wack crazy wild funny and hilarious.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie deals with Steve Martin a famous surgeon married to sexy and greedy Kathleen Turner but he meets a scientist David Warner who makes human experiments and falls in love with a brain in a jar with the voice of Sissy Spacek and he immediately begins searching a house for living . It's a silly remake to 1950 terror science fiction films and specially to Donovan's brain Curt Siodmak  even appear some frames on the movie .This is a film for Steve Martin enthusiasts but has the brand of his own humor  the comedy is crazy and savage . In the film there is tongueincheek  irony  wild humor  giggles  profanities and is quite entertaining and funny . This is the third of four films that actor Steve Martin has made with director Carl Reiner  the other movies are The jerk 1979  All of me 1984 and Dead men don't wear plaid 1982 . And second and final of only two ever produced screenplays that were cowritten by George Gipe who cowrote this film along with director Carl Reiner and actor Steve Martin . Here Steve Martin interprets in his peculiar style  as always . Kathleen Turner  recently her acting in Body Heat repeats the role as the evil and nasty loveless married wife . The picture is rated R for partial nudity  a little bit of violence and profanities . The motion picture was professionally directed by Carl Reiner . Rating  Acceptable and passable .".

	onyx:emotionText "The movie deals with Steve Martin a famous surgeon married to sexy and greedy Kathleen Turner but he meets a scientist David Warner who makes human experiments and falls in love with a brain in a jar with the voice of Sissy Spacek and he immediately begins searching a house for living . It's a silly remake to 1950 terror science fiction films and specially to Donovan's brain Curt Siodmak  even appear some frames on the movie .This is a film for Steve Martin enthusiasts but has the brand of his own humor  the comedy is crazy and savage . In the film there is tongueincheek  irony  wild humor  giggles  profanities and is quite entertaining and funny . This is the third of four films that actor Steve Martin has made with director Carl Reiner  the other movies are The jerk 1979  All of me 1984 and Dead men don't wear plaid 1982 . And second and final of only two ever produced screenplays that were cowritten by George Gipe who cowrote this film along with director Carl Reiner and actor Steve Martin . Here Steve Martin interprets in his peculiar style  as always . Kathleen Turner  recently her acting in Body Heat repeats the role as the evil and nasty loveless married wife . The picture is rated R for partial nudity  a little bit of violence and profanities . The motion picture was professionally directed by Carl Reiner . Rating  Acceptable and passable .";

With Steve Martin to really get his jokes you usually have to put a bit of thought into it .. kind of like Monty Python in that way. There is dumb surface humor and then deeper darker funnier humor for those who wish to dive in and retrieve it.I watched this movie several times in my life and keep wishing I could watch it again. It's that good and has that much going on in it. It would have been good without Steve Martin but with him in it soars from comic to comedic genius.".

The plain joy she gets from her libidoteasing cruelty is one of the funniest aspects of this very funny film. It's not that she needs to have sex with strange gardeners and bellboys you see it's just she so relishes the pain it will cause Dr. H when he finds out. But she wasn't prepared for Dr. H turning the tables on her when he comes across the telepathic brain of a gentle young woman he met in a blackmarket laboratory who shares his passion for singalongs of Under The Bamboo Tree.Why isn't Man With Two Brains more appreciated? Probably because at the time people thought Martin would keep doing silly comedies forever. He was still doing television specials in the early '80s like All Commercials and The Winds Of Whoopie and people took his madcap antics for granted. Who could have guessed that he would settle so soon after following the classic All Of Me into a comfortable middleaged rut of feelgood comedies relieved only once by the glorious excess of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels? It's high time pop culture rediscovered this glorious treasure and maybe reminded Martin what made him so special to begin with.Okay I could do without the music. There's also some sequences that are lamer than others like one near the end that references the pinballvideo game craze of the period. But even the dumber lines Leaping lizards! have a kind of madcap charm. Director Carl Reiner knows how to have fun and there are some sequences that are flatout brilliant especially the dialogue. I love the look inside Dr. Necessiter's condo amazing what a few throw pillows can do while Dr. H and his host have their big debate about the ethics of stealing brains.Dr. H The only time we doctors should accept death is when it's caused by our own incompetence.Dr. Necessiter Nonsense. If the murder of twelve innocent people can help save one human life it will have been worth it.Even the gratuitous nude scenes come with good jokes like the prostitute with the grating voice and love of Gene Chandler music. The best line in the movie is one I can't repeat except it involves the downside of putting the brain of the woman Dr. H loves in the body of a gorilla.You will laugh a lot watching The Man With Two Brains.

As a child of the 80's I can honestly say that this is a representative crosssection of every high school in North America. The geek the jock the outcast the rich prettygirl snob and the future criminal.  They all exist to some degree or another in the classrooms of every high school on the continent.What makes this film rise above the rest is the character development. Every character in this film is threedimensional.  They all change in one way or another by the end of the film.  Whether or not things remain the way they are long after this film ends is unknown and that adds to the rama.  The most important scene in this film is when the characters as a group all open up to oneanother and describe the hell that their daily school routines are in a personal fashion.  Nobody likes the role they must inevitably portray in the highschool scene but the fact is it is often inescapable.  This film gives the viewer some insight into how the other people around them might have felt during that particular time in their lives.Each of the main characters in this film shines but Judd Nelson John Bender and Emilio Estevez Andrew Clark rise above the rest.  Simply put these two actors each put their heart and soul into their respective characters and it shows.At the end of the film the viewer is left to make their own conclusions as to how things will carry forth.  And I'm sure that most people will do that. This is one movie that left me feeling both happy and sad for each of the characters and it isn't easy to make me care about a film in that way.

	schema:reviewBody "Ah the Breakfast Club. Although I am a child of the 80's I came along at the tail end of Generation X. The cast of The Breakfast Club were actors that I looked up to as a child and still enjoy as an adult. I remember my own mother was a big fan of this movie even though she was an adult with children.Of all the Brat Pack movies this remains my favorite. Even over two decades later the movie still holds generations of people captive and sends us all into deep thoughts of our own glory days when we thought that life was BS and that we had it tough. We were just a few years shy of seeing how tough life would be once we escape the protective circus tent known as high school. Over and over you hear people wishing that a sequel to this film had been made. I am very glad there was not one. Surely we can't imagine this would have been a happily ever after for these characters. They came together one day but like most high school relationships all good things must come to an end. The closest thing to a sequel for this movie would be St. Elmo's Fire and again.....all good things must come to an end.One thing that I loved most about this movie was the tell tale showing of intelligence in the least thought of places the school janitor. The movie portrayed the janitor as being a hell of a lot smarter than the assistant principal. I have found in my life's experience this is quite believable. It's also sad. I believe that those employed by the education system could learn a very important lesson about young adults and the way their minds work. Youth knows when it's elders have forgotten how to see things. Youth knows how to use that against them. The moral is simple stay young!".

	schema:headline " One of my personal favorite comedies. John Hughes strikes again!";
	schema:reviewBody "Parents have never understood the youth of the world. Elvis used to be evil. Now he's too tame for modern music enthusiasts. Just imagine how tame Eminem will seem years from now. And as a scarier thought who or what could be worse than some of the singers on today's market?John Hughes is locked in a time capsule still bearing the mind of a teenager and he is able to tap into these feelings of teenage angst. That is what separates The Breakfast Club from say The New Guy or one of those other stupid teen films of recent years.And the jerk played by Judd Nelson isn't meant to be cool. He is a jerk and if older viewers took the time to pay attention to the film they would perhaps realize that the point of the film from the very beginning is to establish that this socalled jerk is only acting like one to get attention. Because he is obviously shunned at home. He's an outcast. And unlike other films that refuse to establish their characters The Breakfast Club introduces him as a jerk and proceeds to explain why he is that way. This is what makes this movie tick.I knew a kid like Bender Nelson once when I was in school and generations of kids continue to go through the exact same things. Once they reach a certain age though it seems as though all adults suddenly break away from the teenage emotions. John Hughes never did I guess. Although he certainly tapped into adult behavior with his best film Planes Trains and Automobiles 1987 a welcome introduction to Hughes' adult comedy hinted at in Vacation 1981 which he wrote.The film opens with a quote from David Bowie that just about sums the entire film up. We are introduced to five kids spending eight hours of detention at Shermer High School in Illinois. They are Andrew the Jock Emilio Estevez Brian the Nerd Anthony Michael Hall Bender the Criminal Judd Nelson Claire the Princess Molly Ringwald and Allison the Basketcase Ally Sheedy. They are looked over by the school principal Paul Gleason who assigns them the task of writing a report on why they are here in detention and what they did to get there.To say that the outcome is predictable is an understatement. We know who's going to get together with whom from the beginning but getting there's all the fun. Watching the characters come to appreciate their differences and learn that they're more than just billboard examples of angry teenagers is more than half the fun.Teenagers are not as unaware of who they are as some people always think. John Hughes knew this and deliberately tapped into this state of mind as no other director has done before  or since for that matter. Sure they've tried. Hughes' Ferris Bueller's Day Off was just about the only other film that tried to show teenagers as something more than stupid hormonecrazy rambunctious adolescents but as young adults who were trying to grow up fast  the scene where Ferris and Sloane pretend their water is wine is good evidence of this.Hughes' teenage characters were not the clichs they are now when The Breakfast Club came out in 1985  this film has proved to be the steeple of teen clichs many of them poked fun at in Not Another Teen Movie which features a cameo by Ringwald. Think of 2001 or Halloween  the drifting spaceships and psycho killers chasing sexhungry teenagers is now routine but it wasn't then. The Jock The Nerd The Criminal The Princess and The Basketcase weren't clichd back then either  although Hughes purposely chose these references to the characters in order to let Brian The Nerd say that they were more than just that in the beginning of the film when he's reading his essay in voiceover narrative.I seriously doubt whether this film is any better than the work of Coppola Cortiz Kurosawa Scorsese Welles et al. If I were assembling a list of the greatest movies ever made I'd never include this.But sometimes the greatest films aren't just the films that are technically perfect but those that connect to you on one level or another. I know that my alltime favorite comedy Planes Trains and Automobiles may not be considered better than something such as Some Like it Hot but that film doesn't affect me the same way. I either don't connect with the story the characters the feelings or I just don't appreciate the film as a whole. I appreciate The Breakfast Club in many ways and for that reason it will always be considered one of my favorite films. Even if it is kinda sappy.".

	schema:headline " Five teenagers are forced to stay in a room together and we learn so much about them....";
	schema:reviewBody "Placing a small group of characters in a single setting for the entire running time of a movie is clever narrative technique  it forces them to talk to each other and through this we learn more about those people through their speech mannerisms and interactions with each other. The concept of The Breakfast Club is exactly that. Five teenagers from all walks of society are forced to stay in a room together and through this they bond and we learn so much about them. And it's also funny nostalgic and a movie that only John Hughes could have pulled off well.The five characters are high school stereotypes and I think there's one of them that each of us relate to. There's the jock the rebel the psycho the promqueen and the geek and they all think they're so different from each other. At first they argue and fight during their detention. Eventually though they realise that they're not so different and actually have a shared hatred  the authority which is keeping them in detention. We see them rebel together get high and reveal their darkest secrets. It manages to be charming and funny while never reaching clich. Where Hughes is a master is character development and he shows us how the characters are bonding and developing without being too preachy.The script and direction is very well managed with John Hughes tapping into the teenage mentality perfectly. What's odd is how timeless the film is with little having changed in school charactertypes over almost 30 years. The acting is also great with Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall giving especially strong performances. The film's focus on teenagers also gives a message about the problems of adults and the one major adult character in the film played by Paul Gleason is also one of my favourites. He is written really well as the antagonistic vice principal and Hughes succeeds well in allowing the teens to usurp him but not too easily.The one main flaw that the film has is in its single setting. It works for the majority but there are definitely times where it lags and feels trapped by the confines that it has set itself. There is not much action in some parts and the dialogue doesn't always carry it through. That said it's funny and enjoyable and an important piece of film for any adolescent to see. There's something for all of us to learn in the adventures of The Breakfast Club.".

	schema:headline " Never judge a book by it's cover.";
	schema:reviewBody "The main setting of The Breakfast Club is at Shermer High School specifically in the library on a Saturday morning. The library is an important aspect in the setting of this movie because it provides a parallel with the dialogue. The script of this movie is heavily laden with dialogue and the spoken story of each character similar to the books writing and words that fill the library shelves. Another important aspect of the library is the quiet nature of the space putting the focus entirely on the characters and their issues. With no other noise or distractions the central focus of the film is clear.An important character to consider that is often overlooked is the assistant principal Richard Vernon. Throughout the film he is portrayed as a villain of sorts out to get the group of students being punished that particular Saturday. Completely unable to relate to his students or any of their situations he only sees what is on the surface. It is pointed out by the janitor later on in the plot that while Vernon assumes the students are the problem in his lack of understanding the new generation he never bothered to look closer and realize it was he who had changed. This plays a major role in the overall theme of the movie which is the inability to see past the surface of a problem or character and judge solely by a look.A pivotal scene for the five students locked away in detention is the group discussion they have about why they came to Saturday detention. Although it is obvious that it is pivotal because they are opening up but it is also pivotal in the mood of the film as well. Before this scene many if not all of the interactions between the characters were cold and isolated making the movie seem tense. As the characters begin to open up the feel of the movie transitions to an easier lighthearted feel that pulls the audience in to the escapades that begin to occur. Not only has it changed the relationship between the characters but it changes the mood of the rest of the movie.The lunches that each character eats are representative of each of their respective parents. Claire eats a fancier meal than the rest Andy's food is loaded with carbohydrates and calories Brian's lunch consists of a crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich Allison's bologna which she discards to replace with candy and Bender who has no lunch. Each meal represents the parenting style of each teenager such as Allison's discarding of part of her sandwich signifies the way they ignore her giving her the freedom to do whatever she wants. The writing in this movie is realistic and plausible seeing as it is an everyday occurrence for us to judge others solely by what is on the outside. The slow reveal of the inner struggles and personal demons of each of the characters is realistic coming slowly and in pieces each filled with emotion. It is obvious that many of the characters do not wish to open up which is very typical of someone dealing with their own issues. The inserted lines of dry and sarcastic humor lighten the mood when it is necessary just as some situations require and easily remind us that they still are in fact teenagers. The writing is very symbolic of the things that can happen to every day high school students although perhaps not as extreme it serves as a guide for those moments that we all have had some sort of experience with.An aspect of grouping in this movie is shown by the colors of the characters. Red for Bender blue for Andy pink for Claire green for Brian and black for Allison. These colors play into the stereotypes that they are portraying further signifying the outer appearance contradiction that the characters struggle with. A smaller grouping is the group of teenagers and the adults. The stark contrast between the two age groups both physically separated and emotionally magnifies the generation gap and the lack of ability to understand one another.The aspect of judgment plays a large role especially in the beginning where each character has made specific judgments against their peers. Applying that to the whole judgment becomes the main theme that motivates them as characters as well as how easily judgments can be changed. In watching this I see media messages that have changed over the years. The message that this film delivers is one that can be forgotten easily but this movie is a nostalgic reminder to never judge a book by its cover.John Hughes was the king of successful movies in the 1980's with this movie being at the forefront of his laundry list of hit films. Seeing as how many movies were based off this movie and others like it The Breakfast Club is a teen drama that has become the stereotypical teen drama. The storytelling techniques such as the ability to show the progression of these characters in a single day and revealing character complexity is something seen even recently in shows like Community.The storytelling technique used by this movie was a unique choice one that is not often seen. It is easy to forget that sometimes and entire story can happen in just a matter of hours in your life not over a long span of time. This technique is adding to my ability to comprehend the realistic nature of cinematic storytelling by proving that you do not need to show weeks or month of passing time to have a story with impact.The Breakfast Club uses its title to emphasize the reason why it is so important not to judge something strictly by what you see.".

	onyx:emotionText "The main setting of The Breakfast Club is at Shermer High School specifically in the library on a Saturday morning. The library is an important aspect in the setting of this movie because it provides a parallel with the dialogue. The script of this movie is heavily laden with dialogue and the spoken story of each character similar to the books writing and words that fill the library shelves. Another important aspect of the library is the quiet nature of the space putting the focus entirely on the characters and their issues. With no other noise or distractions the central focus of the film is clear.An important character to consider that is often overlooked is the assistant principal Richard Vernon. Throughout the film he is portrayed as a villain of sorts out to get the group of students being punished that particular Saturday. Completely unable to relate to his students or any of their situations he only sees what is on the surface. It is pointed out by the janitor later on in the plot that while Vernon assumes the students are the problem in his lack of understanding the new generation he never bothered to look closer and realize it was he who had changed. This plays a major role in the overall theme of the movie which is the inability to see past the surface of a problem or character and judge solely by a look.A pivotal scene for the five students locked away in detention is the group discussion they have about why they came to Saturday detention. Although it is obvious that it is pivotal because they are opening up but it is also pivotal in the mood of the film as well. Before this scene many if not all of the interactions between the characters were cold and isolated making the movie seem tense. As the characters begin to open up the feel of the movie transitions to an easier lighthearted feel that pulls the audience in to the escapades that begin to occur. Not only has it changed the relationship between the characters but it changes the mood of the rest of the movie.The lunches that each character eats are representative of each of their respective parents. Claire eats a fancier meal than the rest Andy's food is loaded with carbohydrates and calories Brian's lunch consists of a crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwich Allison's bologna which she discards to replace with candy and Bender who has no lunch.

This was a very challenging thing to dorelease a film about teens just talking and relating to each other. It also was unjustly awarded an R rating for the frequent swearingbut that's how high schoolers talk!I was in college when this came out but I saw it with a friend who was still in high school. According to him the movie got everything rightthe clothes dialogue styles and music were accurate. He said it was one of the few movies that accurately showed how he felt. I felt the same way. I think any teenager can relate to this movie. The movie is somewhat unpleasant some of the kids really attack each other verbally but there's plenty of comedy mixed in too.The cast Estevez what ever happened to... is just great as the jock. He gives a very believable and moving performance especially in a speech about his father. Nelson however is horrible as the hood. He looks the part but he's way too eloquent and his acting was pretty bad. Ringwald and Hall are perfect in their roles but they WERE teenagers when this was filmed. Sheedy does what she can with a criminally underwritten role. John Kapelos as a janitor is hardly in it I'm assuming his part was severely cut and Paul Gleason a good actor is given a very 1dimensional rolethe evil adult. He does what he can with it.The movie isn't perfectparents are the root of all the kids problems there are annoying lapses in logic like how does Ringwald get to see Nelson at the end and Sheedys character wasn't assigned detention so wouldn't Gleason know that and there is a whole dance sequence squeezed in.Stilla truly great teenage movie.

	schema:reviewBody "The film The Breakfast Club reflects the recognizably flippant disposition that so many 1980's movies so vividly portrayed however it differentiates itself from such a post in several acutely creative aspects. Set in a Chicagoland north suburban high school it accompanied the artistic genre that so many film companies engaged in when using Chicago as an ideal filming venue during the eighties' movie era. Unlike so many films set in Chicago The Breakfast Club capriciously emanates a mandatory acrimony with every one of the main characters in this film! The one scene whereby all of the students commiserate with each other about their justified tales of woe became a scene which evokes a bevy of utterly human responses. At that juncture in this film these students were thoroughly aware of the fact that they could ill afford the luxury of pulling back any punches and it was incumbent upon them to ameliorate their socially awkward circumstances. Each one of them the student Anthony Michael Hall the athlete Emilio Estevez the princess Molly Ringwald the basket case Ally Sheedy and finally the criminal Judd Nelson became the precarious representative of the walk of life whom they represented in the high school which they were attending. The very last scene of Judd Nelson The Criminal was a significant trademark of the entire film's dynamic. Judd Nelson's agitation was manifested through his desultorily assembled attire. As a matter of fact each one of the major characters in this movie were flawlessly executed to exact the proclivities of a handful of teenage cultural stereotypes. Any director andor writer will tell you that articulating a perfect 10 character development with every one of the main characters in any given film becomes an insurmountable task which is neon impossible to successfully accomplish! The movie  The Breakfast Club managed to depict every one of their main characters with an uncanny cogency that puts this film in an auspicious category all by itself! The Breakfast Club was made in 1985 and it was partially responsible for laying out the existing paradigm for movies as well as high school students' attitudes in general for the decade of the 1980's. In 1985 Out of Africa won the academy award for best picture. Out of Africa is of course a fabulous film however The Breakfast Club is far more adept at sparking naturally human interaction into the scope of cinematic entertainment. A film like  The Breakfast Club accommodates the purpose of movie going which is often times to reemphasize the significance of delving into the tumultuous intricacies of faulted human nature. A grass roots recognition of our egregious inadequacies as individuals is an indelibly crucial component to stellar movie making. At such a level the film The Breakfast Club is virtually second to none in procuring such a coveted feat. Director John Hughes deserves one accolade after the next for his efforts in the wonderful production of this film. The acting was phenomenal! Subsequent to the making of the film The Breakfast Club all of these actors and actresses have gone on to be eighties icons as well as perennial top billing entertainers. It has always been a yearly ritual with me to see this film on the Saturday before Easter. Last night I watched The Breakfast Club once again and I thought it was better than I ever previously remember it to be from times before! It is an absolute must to see this 1980's marvel The Breakfast Club  Eighties Classic! An Ultimate Movie Treasure Extraordinaire! Five Stars!".

Even though a lot of people hated his previous works it doesn't matter since many people have flaws in their career once in a while. Well this is one of John Hughes's wellwritten classics The Breakfast Club. It follows a group of teenage kids who have done something to get them to have detention on Saturday!Bummer having to stay in that school on a weekend! Sounds pretty simple huh? Well later on the characters get to know each other thanks to the brilliant writing from John Hughes! Judd Nelson plays Bender who in the movie is called the Criminal and is a straight up asshole but in a cool way. The lovely Molly Ringwald plays Claire who attempts to hide things from people kinda like bottling her emotions. Plus there are other characters I wont get into. My favorite character is obviously Bender since he throws out the jokes which makes this movie funny. Now be warned! You may start tearing up because there are a lot of issues covered in this movie that relates to real life. The stories the characters tell are very poignant and moving and riveting. So don't be surprised if you start crying during the movie. This is a brilliant John Hughes movie that launched his career next to Sixteen Candleswhich is another good Hughes film. What makes this movie so great you say? The way the characters develop is genius thanks to the magnificent directing! The jokes are CLEVER unlike so many other comedies cough Meet the Spartans. However while this movie is great it does have some flaws. One is its a little too long for my taste and its tone is a little mixed up at times. Like is this supposed to be a comedy or a drama? But thats a minor thing for me since I can relate to this movie as a teenager next to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Plus there are so many memorable quotes in this movie! Go see John Hughes's finest written film! Sincerely Yours The Breakfast Club".

	schema:reviewBody "The Breakfast Club is a mark in cinema history? Yes. The so popular genre the teenager genre which explores the teenager world through stereotypes became widely popular in the 80s  and still is and the vast majority of the films in this particular genre shows Nerds being ridiculed and bullied by the popular guys...the 'bad' teacher....a girl that wants to be popular and date the popular guy...etc etc etc. And the great majority of these teenager films are comedies involving parties and lots of sexual references. Basically this is what the genre is about. But then we have Breakfast Club. The film is the examination and study of these stereotypes. There isn't one dimensional characters here. Its the anti thesis of the normal Teenager genre and I say the end of them all. We still have films about teenagers produced nowadays but we know that the genre ended when Breakfast Club was released back in 1985. A film that chooses to explain the characters instead of robotizing them.The Breakfast Club is for the teenager films what Once Upon a Time in the West was for the western genre. The definitive end. And what an ending. 9.010".

	onyx:emotionText "The Breakfast Club is a mark in cinema history? Yes. The so popular genre the teenager genre which explores the teenager world through stereotypes became widely popular in the 80s  and still is and the vast majority of the films in this particular genre shows Nerds being ridiculed and bullied by the popular guys...the 'bad' teacher....a girl that wants to be popular and date the popular guy...etc etc etc. And the great majority of these teenager films are comedies involving parties and lots of sexual references. Basically this is what the genre is about. But then we have Breakfast Club. The film is the examination and study of these stereotypes. There isn't one dimensional characters here. Its the anti thesis of the normal Teenager genre and I say the end of them all. We still have films about teenagers produced nowadays but we know that the genre ended when Breakfast Club was released back in 1985. A film that chooses to explain the characters instead of robotizing them.The Breakfast Club is for the teenager films what Once Upon a Time in the West was for the western genre. The definitive end. And what an ending. 9.010";

There is a main reason why I liked this movie and it's not because of the acting or the way it was made.I'm a high school graduateClass of 2003 and after high school you really take a look at what your years were like. Were you a jock cheerleader nerd weirdo junkie party girlboy pretty ugly skinny fat...? It goes on and on. Either one of these roles we were in high school and we did get harassed at least once by someone and all you could think was Why me?. This movie helps point out what the problems were everyone has their own problems and pressures and take it out on other people. While the kid who pulled a knife on you might go home and have his father beat him almost to death. The nerd you knocked the books out of their hands might go home to parents who are pressuring them to get the best grades they can and put their social life behind. It continues and high school is always going to be like that sorry to those who are still in school.What will happen? You mean on Monday? They whole time during that monologue between the kids at the end I kept on thinking and they'll go back to their regular lives afterwards.I will always recommend The Breakfast Club because you will have a true taste of what high school is like.910".

	schema:headline " The Breakfast Club";
	schema:reviewBody "The Breakfast Club a perfect display of the shenanigans and relative life stories of kids in an unsupervised detention. This classic 1985 film from director John Hughes shatters social barriers and cliques that still exist in schools today. This film not only teaches life lessons but also provides a good laugh. From the phenomenal storyline to the topnotch acting this movie receives a definite thumbsup.The story begins with five high school teenagers each coming from a different clique within Shermer High School spending an entire Saturday in detention together. There is Andy the jock Emilio Estevez Claire the princess Molly Ringwald John the delinquent Judd Nelson Allison the basketcase Ally Sheedy and Brian the brain Anthony Michael Hall. They all know nothing about each other and while in detention are expected to write an essay explaining who they think they are as people. Soon they realize that they are not really sure who they are and that even though they aren't from the same cliques they are more alike than they had originally thought.Each actor sells their role perfectly as a high school student. From their body language to their facial expressions they all suit the role of a teenage adolescent perfectly. Judd Nelson plays a great criminal in school with his extremely laidback body language giving even more support to his don'tcare attitude. Then there is Emilio Estevez playing the jock Andy and his macho man athlete status. Estevez's monotone voice and his ability to show no fear from his facial expressions contributes to his status of the big man on campus and that is a credit to Estevez as an actor. These are only two small examples as the entire cast does a wonderful job.Not only do the actors put on a superb performance but the plot of the film is excellent basically tearing down all social norms in schools in 1985 norms that are still present today. Stereotypically jocks don't get along with nerds and troublemakertoughguys like Bender don't really get along with well anyone. It's interesting in this movie to see how a little turmoil between characters can be solved with just a little conversation and of course with a little help from some marijuana smoked in the school library.This movie has it all laughs crazy antics and all the drama of high school cliques. With great acting and an amazing storyline it's hard to find a reason not to see this movie. It is so easy to relate to since most people already know the experience of high school and the certain social groups or eventually will know someday. The Breakfast Club is a prime example of how difficult it is to really know everything about someone and how closely people's lives can be related no matter where they come from. This film has a funny way of teaching valuable life lessons and also gives an idea of maybe how tolerance of others can help bring people together. There is no doubt that this movie is a mustsee and is absolutely worth the time.".

At the beginning of the movie when they all arrive at school they just figure it was going to be a day of sitting there doing nothing until principal Vernon told them that they need to write an essay about who they are. As the movie start you hear Brains voice giving a brief description of who they are. The theme of the movie is that no matter who you are and what kind of back ground you comes form we all have differences. Bender is always pushing the bottoms of the other to get things out of them on who there are. This brings them all together and they have became friends. The director made his point with different camera angle he would use close up in scene when a point was being made and how the music was tied in is the right point in the movie. The Breakfast Club is a movie that will always be watched. The pressure of being a teen ager will never change. They have become more then when the movie was filmed in 1985. Those pressures of using drugs having sex being forced by your parents to get all A's will never change. Just have to learn how to cope with them and not to judge people until you get to know them and you never know that you might have more then you know in common with that person. It doesn't matter if that person is a jock or a criminal it is just a stereo type of people and those you may think are a criminal might just be just like you and he is being judge by the way he or she acts. I would say that The Breakfast Club is a great movie the points made it the movie will never change in time. That is why people will continue to watch The Breakfast Club. For fifteen year the movie have never died and can be seen on TV this show me that the movie is a classic and the no matter when it is watch people can relate to The Breakfast Club.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this film five very unlikely students end up becoming friends during a Saturday detention. They end up opening up to one another and learning more about each other in one day than most learn in years of friendships. After the discoveries made throughout the day they decide to call themselves The Breakfast Club. With all these students learn and go through together it would be best said that it is a coming of age film with hints of judgment and stereotyping many things in which teenagers go through at this time in their lives.For Clair Molly Ringwald and Andrew Emilio Estevez they fall under the popular clique so they have had previous interactions. While the nerd of the morning falls on Brian Anthony Michael Hall. Then there is always that troubled one in the group whose home life make them the badass they get labeled is that Bender Judd Nelson. Lastly what group would be complete without that of the kooky member which falls to Allison Ally Sheedy. Without each of these roles the coming together the group may not have had as large an impact in how they end up by the end of this film. In some small way they take steps in no longer caring what others may think. Instead they think for themselves for the future.Everything occurs for the most part in one room of a school and with this simple setting using open lighting helps one put more focus on each character and how they change through out the day. Allison and Bender seem to have the most growth during the movie. Sheedy does an amazing job in the beginning showing off the eccentric side of Allison. While Bender keeps his hard edge. It makes it more understandable who he is and what he silently needs. He finds out those things in this group of different kids  people he never dreamed he could befriend. But in each other they all find what none of them could find before  themselves.In some ways no matter the decade I think this movie shows that you can find the best things in life in the most unlikely of places certainly these five students did. Every adolescent has felt or been in a situation where they could relate to one or more of these characters whether it was like the odd one out like Allison the nerdy geek like Brian the troubled like Bender or the popularjock standing like Clair and Andrew. Everyone is being judged by others that are different from them. It's a part of coming of age.".

	schema:reviewBody "So this review was meant to go after film's 30th anniversary in 2015 but I was not using IMDb so I am writing it now when I watched it again last night. Firstly  it's one of the films I can relate to every time as a teenager. Every 80s kid will tell you they got everything right. The characters rightly display the school life of children. The dialogues  what they say  what they mean and their feelings are honestly portrayed that's why it's one of the best. Modern movies have lost this touch and are far far far more clichd but this one is gem. It's one of those movies that you don't want to eat up going for direction  script and all but for it's very heart. As a teenager  the story about 5 high school students spending 8 hours of detention together and what happen between them and why they were there and how they got out is worth watching. It clearly displays the pressure society and parents put on children. My Home Life is UnsatisfyingIf you say you haven't you are a prude  If you say you have  you are a slut . It's a trap and many more dialogues like this capture what it feels like to be in high school.Especially the types which are perfectly portrayed with a message that no one is inferior. All the loners  this one's for you.It clearly states Everyone is bizarre  some are just good at hiding it. There is much more to this movie then I can ever write but I can say I will not forget those two hours as they serve a clear and honest reflection of my own life.It's honest.It tells what it is nothing more. Love  Friendship  comedy  relationship every thing is there and just in words which makes it more effective. Also It has Brenden whom you will never forget plus a whole lot of classic scenes like the dance sequence.".

It clearly displays the pressure society and parents put on children. My Home Life is UnsatisfyingIf you say you haven't you are a prude  If you say you have  you are a slut . It's a trap and many more dialogues like this capture what it feels like to be in high school.Especially the types which are perfectly portrayed with a message that no one is inferior. All the loners  this one's for you.It clearly states Everyone is bizarre  some are just good at hiding it. There is much more to this movie then I can ever write but I can say I will not forget those two hours as they serve a clear and honest reflection of my own life.It's honest.It tells what it is nothing more. Love  Friendship  comedy  relationship every thing is there and just in words which makes it more effective. Also It has Brenden whom you will never forget plus a whole lot of classic scenes like the dance sequence.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Breakfast Club was a breakthrough movie in the 80's. John Hughes wrote and directed this masterpiece about five completely dissimilar teenagers who are forced to spend 8 hours together in the library for detention. This movie can grab you in making you laugh or making you even shed a tear. The Breakfast Club is one of the best movies from the 80's and possibly the best teenage movie of the century.I always find some hilarious lines from John Bender Does Barry Manilow know you raid his wardrobe? and some great lines from Principal Vernon. The movie manages to make you laugh a lot. However for these five teens they may be dissimilar but they all relate to having parent issues. Somewhere between the arguing with them all they find friendships in their 8 hour endeavor which is shown in the last 30 minutes of the film. One of the best and funniest scenes from the film is where they gather to the back of the library and smoke weed. Although a very obviously wrong thing to do they manage to shield the pain through the drugs supposedly. It portrays how teens live their lives and when they need to get away from the abuse they might have. Emilio Estevez doing backflips across the library while the rest are stoned on the couch is an example of the comedic style and energy shown through adolescence. The first hour makes you laugh makes you root makes you wish for the 80's and makes you think. After all the chaos Arguing Smoking Escaping Vernon Laughing Crawling through the air vents.etc they gather on the top of the library and create one of the best and most wonderfully scripted emotional scenes to date.In the last superbemotional 30 minutes of the film They pour their hearts out to each other. Emotional topics such as suicide abuse and drugs are brought into the conversation caused by all of their parents. Molly Ringwald's character Claire doesn't believe their friendships will carry on after the Saturday of detention when Brian Anthony Michael Hall asks the question. They all eventually break into tears after they all admit the stress of life school and popularity.They end a legendary conversation with admitting that they care about each other and a laugh at Brian's expense although he eventually laughs with them too. After dancing to 80's pop music in happiness which i yearn to hear in movies again giving Allison a makeover and writing the supposed letter posed to be written to Mr. Vernon in the beginning about who they think they are They walk out of detention with pride and accomplishment. The film ends with Bender raising his fist to the sky on the school field as a freeze frame.Although i didn't describe every detail of the film Relationships Locker Scene Closet Scene Gym Scene.etc i summed up what the movie was about and it is a fun watch. It may bring you nostalgia but it always manages to bring a smile to your face at least for me. The Breakfast Club is a classic that will always be one of my favorite movies. Rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Ron Howard's actionthriller about two brothers Baldwin and Russell who have some differences but need to work together to find out whose causing recent arson fires in their district. THe film is done well good acting for the most part brilliant direction and a decent screenplay. I thought William Baldwin started out the first couple scenes with a bit of a constant smirk on his face but his acting seemed to improve or maybe grow on me he gave a satisfying performance. Meanwhile Russell was solid as well as his older brother who is an oldfashioned bitter fireman who takes too many risks. The female performances were rather average Jennifer Jason Leigh was decent as Jennifer a girl who helps Brian Baldwin. Rebecca DeMornay is not so great as Steven Russel's exwife. Robert DeNiro was great in his role as a fire department detective trying to solve the case. J.T. Walsh was also decent in his role which was similar but expanded in F. Gary Gray's THe Negotiator. The best performance of the film came from Scott Glenn who was great as a firefighter known as Axe. I haven't seen Ladder49 so this is my favorite firefighter movie as of now. The script had some problems as it didn't flow well but the actors managed to save it although i was particularly upset with one dialogue between jennifer jason leigh and william baldwin which seemed like a complete ripoff of the scene where Michael Corleone and Kay see each other again after Michael is back from Sicily in Godfather part 1. But for the most part the script was average not bad but saved by brilliant direction solid acting and great action. The music was done very well and suited the film props to Hans Zimmer for yet another great score. The cinematography was also very good especially in the fire scenes good job by Mikael Salomon. 810".

This movie did an excellent job capturing some of the emotions that flow through every firehouse in America today particularly after 911 we are a brotherhood in which the I gowe go mentality is a very REAL concept that most of us live by everyday.

	schema:reviewBody "It's weird to think that when I went to see Home Alone in the theaters Backdraft was advertised right before the movie came on. The whole thing is a little grimmer than we usually expect from Ron Howard. It focuses on mutually hostile brothers Stephen Kurt Russell and Brian McCaffrey William Baldwin both firefighters in Chicago having to put aside their differences to fight an arson outbreak.True it doesn't really sound like much of a plot but Howard knows how to keep everything going. Stephen is the sort of guy with a bad attitude whom you can't help but respect. Brian mainly shows that there was once a time when Alec Baldwin's brothers could act. As for the climax that is really something that is likely to shock you royally. But don't get me wrong. This is a good movie. Maybe not any kind of masterpiece but worth seeing nevertheless. Above all it's not a disaster movie the less said about The Towering Inferno the better. Also starring Robert DeNiro Donald Sutherland Jennifer Jason Leigh Scott Glenn Rebecca DeMornay and J.T. Walsh.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's weird to think that when I went to see Home Alone in the theaters Backdraft was advertised right before the movie came on. The whole thing is a little grimmer than we usually expect from Ron Howard. It focuses on mutually hostile brothers Stephen Kurt Russell and Brian McCaffrey William Baldwin both firefighters in Chicago having to put aside their differences to fight an arson outbreak.True it doesn't really sound like much of a plot but Howard knows how to keep everything going. Stephen is the sort of guy with a bad attitude whom you can't help but respect. Brian mainly shows that there was once a time when Alec Baldwin's brothers could act. As for the climax that is really something that is likely to shock you royally. But don't get me wrong. This is a good movie. Maybe not any kind of masterpiece but worth seeing nevertheless. Above all it's not a disaster movie the less said about The Towering Inferno the better. Also starring Robert DeNiro Donald Sutherland Jennifer Jason Leigh Scott Glenn Rebecca DeMornay and J.T. Walsh.";

	schema:reviewBody "Backdraft is one of those movies that stays on your mind after you've seen it. It is just so amazingly shot and the story takes you in. When I first saw this movie maybe five years ago I thought the fire sequences were extremely realistic and I still do. I thought that Ron Howard did an excellent job directing this film and the cast was superb.The story is about two feuding brothers Stephen and Brian McCaffrey both of who are part of the Chicago Fire Department. The story covers the reason behind the McCaffrey's feud the hardships and adventures of a firefighter's life and the consequences of the phenomenon known as a backdraft. Someone is also murdering people and covering their deaths with this phenomenon. The McCaffrey's discover that they have to work together to solve this unsolvable mystery.I thought that Kurt Russel was perfect as Stephen McCaffrey because he provided the toughness and grit necessary for the role. And William Baldwin was perfect as Brian the McCaffrey brother who is still searching for his place in the world and trying to fit into the role that both his father once played and that his brother Stephen is now playing. Scott Glenn is also perfectly cast as Axe.The film perfectly shows the life of a fireman the hardships the pains and the glory. It also shows that two people can put aside their differences for the greater good. I strongly recommend Backdraft to everyone. It is a very powerful movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Backdraft is a movie definitely worth watching from famous director Ron Howard who continues to show his skill as a filmmaker with this one. Kurt Russell William Baldwin Scott Glenn Jennifer Jason Leigh Rebecca De Mornay and Robert De Niro are great in the movie bringing to life these believable characters we see on the screen. The rest of the cast are admirable in their small roles including J.T. Walsh Jason Gedrick and Donald Sutherland. Its better to watch this movie without knowing too much about it because if you do than you're going to be in for a heck of a movie experience. The film tells story of two brothers Russell and Baldwin in the fire department whose bond is tested as mysterious murders begin to occur by a dangerous arsonist on the loose. Backdraft is an excellent story about fire fighters with realistic action for the most part suspense some humor and a little romance that make for an enjoyable movie to watch. The film did seem to drag a little near the end but its one flaw so the good more than outweighs the bad. If you're looking for an entertaining movie to watch that's worth your time and money then see Backdraft. You can't go wrong with this film. It's definitely one of Ron Howards best movies on par with Apollo 13 and A Beautitful Mind. It's really that good.".

The core of the movie the story of 2 feuding firefighter brothers played by Kurt Russell and Adam Baldwin. This part of the story may be cliched but the 2 actors do a good job in their roles especially Russell he plays the elder brother trying to protect his screwup younger brother from the dangers of firefighting. The other parts are less successful there is a subplot involving the wife of Russell's wife inabilty to deal with his risk taking in his job Rebecca DeMornay does what she can with a small role. The other subplot of the story is the one that doesn't work it involves the murders of financial experts hire by a city alderman to close down firestations for financial gain. This part of the story should have been scrapped it just chops up screen time and is never compelling. That leaves the action scenes they are spectacular. The fire scenes keep you on the edge of your seat. The special effects are great but even though the script is corny the actors made me care enough for what was happening to them. It is directed by Ron Howard who usually is more successful in the human side of the story he seems to have spent more time on the technical side of the story than the human side.

	schema:reviewBody "Although Backdraft got Oscar nominations for Best Sound and best visual and audio effects what drives this Ron Howard film is the performances he got from Kurt Russell and Billy Baldwin as the firefighting McCaffrey brothers. The brothers have a lot of distance in their ages as Russell practically raised McCaffrey after their firefighter father was killed on the job. Baldwin realizes he has a big legacy with the Chicago Fire Department and he's hesitant about it. After some issues with Russell Baldwin gets assigned to arson investigator Robert DeNiro.Which gets Baldwin involved in DeNiro's investigation of some strange arson fires that were set to Backdraft and cause homicides and there is a connection between three seemingly unrelated deaths.The fire effects were great and the location shooting in Chicago a definite plus. Backdraft is the kind of a film you just cannot make on a studio backlot which 50 years ago it would have been. I'm surprised some Oscar nominations didn't come for either Russell or Baldwin. Their performances are so good you forget they're actors and you think you are watching firefighting drama.And Donald Sutherland's bit role as the Hannibal the Cannibal of arsonists is one you'll remember. He has two scenes one with DeNiro at a parole hearing and later one with Baldwin as Baldwin seeks expert opinion on the arsonist's technique. In that scene Sutherland evokes Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter when FBI agent Jodie Foster seeks his expertise.And this review is dedicated to all the firefighters all over the world who take on that terribly important job to protect citizens from flame. After watching Backdraft you might get an insight into why the ancient cave people worshiped this phenomenon.".

Watching Backdraft will not only answer those questions but it will also open your eyes to a new perspective. This is one hell of a film to see. Never have I seen action scenes so intense. Adding to the strong action sequences are the powerful performances by the lead actors. Kurt Russell and upcoming star William Baldwin play two brothers who argue repetitively due to their troubled childhood. This issue is established at the beginning of the film which then sets the tone for the rest of the movie. What's even more amazing is how convincing these actors do this job. You actually look at the characters like they're real people and not just another actor on screen. The more you watch this movie the more you will become convinced that they do fire fighting for a living. It's that believable. Costarring with Baldwin and Russell are these wellknown actors Robert De Niro Donald Sutherland and Scott Glenn.So what is it about these action sequences? Well of course they're going to involve fires! But what makes these scenes work is how the fires are filmed. There are parts where you see flames creep along the floor in slow motion and there are other times where the fire fighters are engulfed by fire that there's nothing else on screen. Some sound effects in the explosions are different and intriguing as well. You would almost think for split second do raging fires really create that kind of sound?Even more profound is the soundtrack in this movie. The film score was composed and conducted by Hans Zimmer. Right from the beginning of the film he starts out with a song that brings such an honorable look at fire fighters and what they do. Along with its good cast and progression of bigger fire hazards it really makes the movie all the more influential. It's so good it may even inspire some viewers to join or volunteer their time to their local fire stationsquad.Backed by powerful performances big explosions and a moving soundtrack Backdraft is the fire fighter movie to see before all others. It will also give the viewer a better appreciation for their local career and volunteer men and women.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fantastic fire fighting film that's really moving and emotional with brilliant effects and outstanding performances!. All the characters are fantastic and the story is really excellent plus Kurt Russell William Baldwin and Robert De Niro are all simply amazing in this!. It really is quite a powerful film in my opinion as I didn't find it cheesy at all and the ending while excellent is extremely sad plus Russell and William Baldwin had wonderful chemistry together. Donald Sutherland has a really creepy role in this and while it has a couple predictable moments it surprisingly was able to keep me guessing for the most part plus it's extremely well made and pretty well written as well. The Fire effects really blew me awayespecially in the finale and The opening is also quite sad plus you are able to care for the two brothers Russell and Baldwin because you can tell they have had some problems with each other and have gone through rough times.One of my favorite funny moments in this film is when Baldwin Brian and Jennifer Jason Leigh Jen are making out at the top of the fire truck and then the fire team squad have to go stop a fire as I thought that was quite amusing and there is lots of suspense as well plus I think this should be a lot higher then 6.6 in my opinion. Some scenes were incredibly tense and if you wanted to be a fireman someday then you most definitely should see this movie plus I thought it was cool how Russell played 2 roles as the dadin the opening and the brother Stephen!. I was actually really surprised how good the story was as I as expecting a cheesy B type one and it has one of the finest casts ever plus I wish they gave De Niro more screen time because he had an awesome character. I would go as far to say that this is a minor classic and the person who was committing those fire's may not be as easy to guess as you think as I didn't expect it to be that person at all plus it had a very good score as well. This is a fantastic fire fighting film that's really moving and emotional with brilliant effects and outstanding performances and I say go see it now!.The Direction is fantastic!. Ron Howard does a fantastic! job here with brilliant camera work incredible angles adding some good atmosphere and did lots of other awesome shots as well plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace.The Acting is outstanding!. Kurt Russell is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable funny had wonderful chemistry with William Baldwin had an awesome character and I felt for him in a lot of scenes he also had some awesome emotional scenes with Baldwin as usual brought a lot of charisma and did a lot of courageous stuff I adored his performance! Russell Rules!!!!!!!. William Baldwin is also amazing here as Russell's younger brother Brain he was extremely likable vulnerable and had a haunted past as you will be rooting for him he is the only Baldwin I like out of the bunch as I was really surprised by how amazing he was here!. Robert De Niro is also amazing as always and is amazing here he had a roughgruff character but was a nice guy actually he brought his usual intensity and had a great character I just wish they gave him more screen time cause he is one of the best ever he also had some great scenes with Baldwin De Niro Rules!!!!!!!. Donald Sutherland is really creepy in his role and he was able to pull it off perfectly as it was a somewhat difficult role I Imagine he was awesome. Jennifer Jason Leigh is beautiful and does what she has to do very well which unfortunately wasn't much I wish they gave her more screen time. Scott Glenn is great as Axe he was intense I quite liked him he was especially good near the end. Rebecca De Mornay is beautiful and does fine in her role and had some good scenes with Russell however not enough screen time. Jason Gedrick is very good as the rookie Tim I liked him. J.T. Walsh is excellent as the sleaze ball Mayor I hated him. Rest of the cast are fine.Overall go see it now!.  out of 5".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a fantastic fire fighting film that's really moving and emotional with brilliant effects and outstanding performances!. All the characters are fantastic and the story is really excellent plus Kurt Russell William Baldwin and Robert De Niro are all simply amazing in this!. It really is quite a powerful film in my opinion as I didn't find it cheesy at all and the ending while excellent is extremely sad plus Russell and William Baldwin had wonderful chemistry together. Donald Sutherland has a really creepy role in this and while it has a couple predictable moments it surprisingly was able to keep me guessing for the most part plus it's extremely well made and pretty well written as well. The Fire effects really blew me awayespecially in the finale and The opening is also quite sad plus you are able to care for the two brothers Russell and Baldwin because you can tell they have had some problems with each other and have gone through rough times.One of my favorite funny moments in this film is when Baldwin Brian and Jennifer Jason Leigh Jen are making out at the top of the fire truck and then the fire team squad have to go stop a fire as I thought that was quite amusing and there is lots of suspense as well plus I think this should be a lot higher then 6.6 in my opinion. Some scenes were incredibly tense and if you wanted to be a fireman someday then you most definitely should see this movie plus I thought it was cool how Russell played 2 roles as the dadin the opening and the brother Stephen!. I was actually really surprised how good the story was as I as expecting a cheesy B type one and it has one of the finest casts ever plus I wish they gave De Niro more screen time because he had an awesome character.

	schema:headline " This movie is poor representation of modern firefighting!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was going in thinking it would be a awesome film but I got burn. It's no way realistic. I know it's Hollywood so there going to take some liberties but this movie has a ridiculous portrayal of firefighters. These firefighters are so terribly trained that they don't even know how to don their gear correctly. When Stephen Bull McCaffrey Kurt Russell goes into the 2 story building to rescue the child from a fire he has his coat wide open and no SCBA equipment. The smoke would have killed him in a matter of seconds as his lungs would be seared by the heat. If anybody was to run into a fire filled room with their coat undone they'd be cooked like a goose! Most of the characters would have died within the first 30 seconds of the film from having seared lungs smoke inhalation or extreme burns. I like how the fire can explode right in their face and they don't end up getting first or second degree burns. The amount of smoke that was in the fires if real life would have been blinding not clear. By the way what type of firefighters smoke cigarettes while cleaning up a burned out building after breathing in tons of smoke? I would be afraid to light up in a building that might have gases in it because it might start a fire again.As for the title of the film 'Backdraft'. It's very incredibly rare behavior of fire. Even if you were the evil genius arsonist setting these backdraft you would need to spend days creating just the right environment where a backdraft can occur. It's a easy task. Honestly the idea that an arsonist is creating backdrafts to kill certain individuals is preposterous to begin with. I'm not a firefighter and I know that it would be nearly impossible to do that and it would certainly be impossible to do it to the extent that the arsonist does here. The movie plot is suppose to just that. Firefighters trying to catch the arsonist but screenwriter Gregory Widen shovels one subplot on top of another and it becomes too much. There is the subplot about two brothers Stephen McCaffrey and Brian McCaffrey William Baldwin having a love and hate relationship with Brian living under the shadow of his heroic brother and father. The movie is very clichs with the firefighter heroics such in the case it becomes unrealistic. The first shot of Kurt Russell's Stephen is him walking out a burning building in a manly pose. This is follow up with a heroic slow moment of him rescuing a kid. It's so cheesy. Even the opening scene is over the top with the firefighters taking a child with them to fight fires. Who is going to babysit the kid while you are fighting fires? Is taking a child to a fire zone kinda dangerous? Director Ron Howard seeks to wring tears from the audience by having a fireman's helmet incredibly bounce out of a second story window in front of the kid and everybody slow motion moves around is just poetic stupid. The worst is the silly montage of Brian training under his brother with dripping his head in water as if a male model. Another subplot of the film is Stephen trying to get back with his estranged wife Helen McCaffrey Rebecca De Mornay which doesn't play no factor into the main plot. No honestly it's doesn't play into anything. It's just waste screen time that could have better been focus on finding the arsonists. The best scenes in the film are that of Brian teaming up with Donald Shadow Rimgale Robert de Niro a dedicated arson investigator looking for the backdraft killer. They even get help from Arsonist 'Silent of the Lambs' what a be Hannibal Lector Ronald Bartel Donald Sutherland. Donald Sutherland is pretty creepy in his role. A fire eats and breathes and hates. He quotes. Sorry but fires don't hate only people hate Ronald. Firs is not a living entity film. Robert de Niro is great in his role and get closer to closer to finding the murderer. Too bad Brian is rarely any help. Brian barely does anything in the film for the main character but gets in the way of better supporting characters. Rather than finding the killer he is having sex with Jennifer Vaitkus Jennifer Jason Leigh Brian's exgirlfriend and works for the city alderman who trying to cut back the fireman department budget. Her loyalties are torn between her job and Brian. I think making love on top of a speeding fire truck will get you fired in real life.William Baldwin is no Alec. His performance was horrible. The way he played puppy dog in an attempt to convey depression and selfpity it was eyerolling bad. Baldwin's role was originally written for Tom Cruise who would have given the movie some muchneeded star power. He is disappointing. The film tries way too hard to be cool instead of realistic which is a shame considering that a film about firefighters and arson could have been wholly intriguing while remaining believable had it been attempted properly. Instead this film feels so fake with the over the top action sequences. The factory argument in particular is awful. Rather than putting out the fire they waste their time arguing while the building is burning around him. Don't get me wrong the action scenes are impressive and the special effects are still rather extraordinary but it's scenes like that that makes me cringe. Han Zimmer's score is amazing in my opinion. The best thing to come out of this movie is Backdraft fire special effects show at Unversial Studios Hollywood and that's not saying much. It closed down in 2010 after 19 years worth of shows. Overall watch it if bored but don't think too much into it. It's just a pointless popcorn flick".

All I have to say is that they are right just like the action is the real star in a lot of movies. I mean wasn't the car the real star in Bullet? The car is sort of the star in Supernatural too isn't it...and besides how many movies have you seen that star fire and well it's so cool in a pyromania action adventure sort of way.They also say it is full of clichs and well they are right on that count too. BUT well a lot of other action movies are walltowall clichs and have cops and guns and are loved. This is the same thing only with fire and should be loved for the same reasons.At least clichs with fire is far more original than clichs with guns in the action movie trope.The acting isn't as melodramatic as people say. There are one or two scenes where yeah everyone has to admit that they are overthetop but on the whole we still see a lot of naturalistic acting.What you have here is just a fun movie...but it is a fun movie written by Gregory Widen and he really is a great screen writer with some truly original and fun ideas. You see his name attached as a writer and you know you're in for a fun time. It's just a shame the people that wrote the sequels to his films ruined his career.".

	schema:reviewBody "The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie Stand By Me a movie I have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it but for some odd reason he didn't like it. He lends me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me that he's shown it to many people and they loved it instead I hated this movie. I don't think I've hated a movie so much in a while how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me. I couldn't keep up with the five million stories here Billy Baldwin becoming a fire man the random sibling rivalry the random love storys the who's being an arson story the investigator the fire who has a personality of it's own. I just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories they didn't balance out well enough make the film interesting. I would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why.The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters two brothers. Stephen Bull McCaffrey the elder brother is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. Brian the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. He is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter. Donald Shadow Rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. He is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. .Martin Swayzak is an alderman on the City Council. He has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. Many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters. However Swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes.I just couldn't get into this movie I don't know how anyone else could it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong. I loved how they had every action clich in the book to match this action flick. I just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles Donald Sutherland great actor but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time. I know Ron was going for great quality but I think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film. I even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there I didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people I'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on.210".

Fire investigator Donald Rimgate Robert DeNiro is the man responsible for tracking the arsonist down.On paper this should have worked it has talented actors like Kurt Russell Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland on board and an interesting premise which to me seemed to suggest a mix of social commentary action and cat and mouse antics. To say that this film did not live up to my expectations would be a massive understatement because it didn't even come close....For a start Ron Howard suffocates the film with all kinds of different themes strained relations between brothers strained relations between spousesgirlfriends firefighting investigating. Usually I like films with a wide variety of themes as invariably they have depth complexity and give the mind something to chew on but here Howard introduces these themes but doesn't expand upon any of them. The two firefighting brothers don't get on why exactly? The younger brother disappeared for a number of years  where did he go and why did he disappear? The lack of clarity makes it very hard to care about or form any understanding of the brothers them both being so unlikeable doesn't help either neither did their continuous squabbling. The melodrama between the brothers and their partners was also tiresome and uninteresting and took up far too much of the running time.Even if we focus our attention on the action then Howard failed to really engage me in what should have been an open goal the action scenes are good at first but they become repetitive and I was never enthralled or interested at any point during the film. The investigative side of the film which should have been the real focus is very choppy and Howard failed to make it interesting or engage me in that aspect of the story.The acting is a bit of a mixed bag Kurt Russell has his usual cocksure swagger about him but he does at least make the film fun. William Baldwin is bland and De Niro is fairly lowkey aside from one scene where he gets to flex his acting chops. Donald Sutherland is convincing as a crazy guy but he felt more like an afterthought than anything else.However you look at Backdraft it is a poor film which has too much going on for its own good. I appreciate what firefighters do and think they are very brave so I do feel a bit bad bashing this film but I was never given a reason to care at any point in this film and if I'm totally honest I found it pretty boring.".

Ron Howard's direction manages to cover the minor flaws and carry the story.It does demand a bit of attention to follow all the details twists and turns in the plot but this makes it more enjoyable when you see it the second or third time e.g. Adcox McCaffrey senior's peer is the young firefighter that hugs little boy McCaffrey after his father dies. This same Adcox approaching retirement finds himself working for the older McCaffrey brother and their relationship is key to the story.Unless you are thoroughly bored by detective movies troubled relationships and firefighting this movie is well worth seeing but you have to watch closely or see it more than once to appreciate how well crafted it is.I gave it 9 of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This film goes very deeply into the problems that Children with the form of Autism know as Aspergers syndrome. The film uses glimpses of what seems to be a future interview with many of the characters to build a suspenseful atmosphere thru the whole film. The use of flashbacks thru out the film to explain Bens early childhood are extremely effective in conveying the listlessness that is felt by parents and children as they try and find out why their child is different. I will leave it to others to provide a plot summery but I will tell you something of the experience of the screening at the Montreal World Film Festival. Both the director Nic Balthazar and the actor who played Ben Greg Timmermans addressed the crowd that night before the beginning of the film. Nic Balthazar spoke to the crowd in fluent French and English himself with no translator leading to a booming applause as he talked of his joy at being at the festival and of working with Greg on his first film. Greg Timmermans then went ahead and spoke to us in passable French and English and talked of how nervous he was on that night. This is Greg Timmermans first film and he preformed beyond beautifully bring subtlety to his role rarely seen by seasoned actors let alone a brand new face. This is not to diminish the other actors and actresses all of whom preformed extraordinary well. I hope that this film recedes world wide distribution for it is one of the most pointed comments I've ever seen or heard of on the treatment that children with these types of differences receive from classmates teachers and parents. Though I say this the teachers while sometimes seeming exasperated and at a loss for what to do were never cruel intentionally or otherwise. This film ranked as the best film that I was able to see in my short time at the festival. Lastly I would like to say that as the credits began to roll the audience roared forth with applause that did not cease completely for a full 35 minutes.I left this film with my tears proudly displayed on my cheeks.Good luck in competition to the cast and crew of BenX. May you see wide spread distribution and happy lives. You have touched my heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was interested in this film as soon as I read about it because you don't see that often that the topic of games is incorporated in a serious film with relevant issues. I was interested in how they would blend in images of the game world and the real one. It turned out fine the movie is beautifully shot.From the beginning on the film makes you believe it's going to end in a predictable way but it had a good surprise ending. Of note are the well thought out monologues of Ben X using very little words to express what he feels something he cannot do towards others.The movie also kept it's integrity in showing how most autistic people would probably be towards girls mostly invisible. Although Scarlite plays an important role in the film she's mostly in Ben's mind. Ben is also not spared when the cruelties committed against him are revealed. There was definitely a statement in the film without handing out a clear solution.On a side note personally I think autistic people should be able go to special schools. They are in some ways very gifted and smart and should be cherished that way rather than treated as people with a problem that should constantly struggle to adapt.Back to the film all in all it delivered all you could want from director Nic Balthazar who I only knew as host of TV show Filmfan and I knew it would have integrity because he is clearly an honest and personable guy.There's also a lot of nice extra's on the DVD including the game Archlord itself overall a well thought out complete film package!".

Of note are the well thought out monologues of Ben X using very little words to express what he feels something he cannot do towards others.The movie also kept it's integrity in showing how most autistic people would probably be towards girls mostly invisible. Although Scarlite plays an important role in the film she's mostly in Ben's mind. Ben is also not spared when the cruelties committed against him are revealed. There was definitely a statement in the film without handing out a clear solution.On a side note personally I think autistic people should be able go to special schools. They are in some ways very gifted and smart and should be cherished that way rather than treated as people with a problem that should constantly struggle to adapt.Back to the film all in all it delivered all you could want from director Nic Balthazar who I only knew as host of TV show Filmfan and I knew it would have integrity because he is clearly an honest and personable guy.There's also a lot of nice extra's on the DVD including the game Archlord itself overall a well thought out complete film package!";

	schema:reviewBody "If you remember your high school experience you may agree that there is a widespread distrust of not just anyone different but anyone perceived as being intelligent. In Belgian director Nic Balthazar's Ben X Ben Greg Timmermans is not only highly intelligent but is different  very different. Ben has Asperger Syndrome a form of Autism that causes social isolation physical clumsiness abnormal speech patterns and limited areas of interest. With Ben we see it in the way he goes through his morning rituals of washing and dressing saying goodbye to his mother and the tense way he walks to school listening to his Walkman without expression as loud music booms in his ears.We also see it in Ben's obsession with the video game Archlord which he plays every morning before going to school. Called Frankenstein and the Martian at school in the computer game he is a powerful figure everything he cannot be in the real world  hero and ruthless slayer of enemies. He also has a love interest a virtual girlfriend named Scarlite Laura Verlinden who is his healer. Integrating scenes from the virtual world of online gaming into the main story the film blurs the distinction between the internal world of Ben's mind and the reality he faces daily and with Ben as the narrator the effect can be fragmented leaving doubt about what is real and what is not a situation that creates some confusion.Ben X is also the story of the struggle of Ben's mother Maijke Pinoy a woman relentlessly devoted to her son without receiving any affection in return. She suffers when Ben goes to school and is fearful when he comes home. She knows that school for Ben is a harsh reality one he never talks about. Although the film tells us that it is based on a true story and opens with an ominous warning that in video games and life someone always has to die we root for Ben and hope that he will discover a larger sense of self. However when classmates Bogaert Titus de Voogd Belgium's hottest young actor and Desmedt Maarten Claeyssens two of the most obnoxious bullies ever seen on screen pull his pants down in the front of the class while others stand around and watch or film it on their mobile devices we fear the worst.When this is posted on the internet for everyone in the school and in his family to see Ben downloads a document entitled 101 Ways to Kill Yourself creates a dagger in shop class and enlists Scarlite in devising an end game that takes the film in an astonishingly new direction. Ben X is visually stunning and the first featurefilm for Greg Timmermans who though he looks too old for the role conveys Ben's internal struggle with amazing authenticity. Based on the bestselling book Nothing Was All He Said that also became a play the film pulls no punches in its depiction of the extent of bullying taking place in the school with only passive concern from teachers and administrators. Balthazar has said that he hopes the film which will soon get a U.S remake will open discussions about bullying in a country where ten percent of teens admit that they have attempted suicide. That would be a most welcome end game.".

I saw over 200 films at over a dozen festivals in 2007 and don't remember it happening more than a few times. It hasn't happened at all in the last few I've attended. Well it happened tonight.

Firstly I was interested in the gaming angle and the whole escape reality online scenario. Secondly I recently discovered that the feeling that I was just wrong that I've had all my life is in fact Aspergers Syndrome. Ironically for an Aspie Ben X moved me like no other movie I can think of a couple of time I almost burst into tears. It does a great job of portraying the everyday logistical nightmare that is pretending to be normal as well being misunderstood by most people in general and also illustrates well some of the mental and physical traits that are part of an Aspies make up. I could identify with so many things in this movie the sensitivity to detail the overwhelming nature of the outside world and even overlaying a video game engine onto everyday situations. I felt validated by the film makers acknowledgements and portrayals of the Aspie ways. I also identified with some of the very dark places the story takes you as well. The story sometimes skips between being a celebration of the Aspie way and an illustration of the dangerous road travelled with naivete that can be the Aspies journey. As already mentioned the film sets up some very dark avenues making you aware of the potentials without actually showing them all to you. These situations are all too often only narrowly missed by people with Aspergers.The acting was very good as was the attention to detail the main character was portrayed very well the actors debut by all accountsand the story has a satisfying and heart rending conclusion...If you like your movies raw with the meat of human experience then you owe it to yourself to see Ben X....".

These situations are all too often only narrowly missed by people with Aspergers.The acting was very good as was the attention to detail the main character was portrayed very well the actors debut by all accountsand the story has a satisfying and heart rending conclusion...If you like your movies raw with the meat of human experience then you owe it to yourself to see Ben X....";

The director knows how to pull off an intense portrayal of a life between reality and fantasy.

What I went through as a child and as a teen is nothing compared to what kids today have to contend with. When I was young I did not have to worry about kids carrying weapons or selling drugs in the schoolyard or gangs. Kids being bullied today have it far worse than I did and it was unbearable for me way back then. Perhaps that might help to put bullying into perspective for some.

Thank God this wasn't true.It has been a long time since I've seen a movie that's this goodThe movie brings forth a quite realistic view of school youth and their cruelty. Secondly it also represents the world of a bully victim quite vividly. I can say this first hand. To complete this masterpiece it adds a very interesting twist in the end.Well worth watching. Captivating from the beginning to the end. In my personal opinion every school should show this to their classroom at some point.".

I saw that fear is and was the most difficult thing that Ben had to overcome. Imagine being lost in Autism and having to find your own way out. FEAR. Overcoming fear is the answer...maybe for all of us. Some of us don't have fear and are lost for nothing to overcome. Poor souls.

However I had forgotten that I thought The Fugitive was a useless remake of the TV series until I was dragged to it and founda fine suspenseful feature filled with a plethora of colorful characters. So I should have been tuned in more to my own personal history but so it goes.I now have watched U.S. Marshalls a number of times and I have to say the two companion films match each other in quality.The pacing is fast without being frenetic. The use of repetition i.e. recurring motifs such as Kimball diving off a dam to safety  Sheridan swinging down to hop a commuter train work well  though they could have been disastrous. The large cast is compelling down to the smallest roles similar to The Fugitive in that regard. Jones Snipes and Downey all show range in their partsDowney as always illustrates why he is one of the best of his generation. And some of the secondary roles shine in particular Tom Wood as Deputy Marshall Noah Newman. He receives more screen time than in the predecessor and he makes use of it well. He has one of those acting moments in a confrontation with Downey's character his intense expression of simultaneous fear  anger is a plum bit of acting chops. Like other IMDb readers I wonder what has happened with this good actor. No screen credits since 2000. Stage work? Left the biz? If the former and he's in NYC then we'll probably see him on a Law  Order episode one of these days! I recently found a DVD with tons of extras on it  but I have not as yet delved into them. I look forward to doing that as I do another viewing of the film.".

U.S. Marshals is the action thriller film and fan of the genre would drool over. The now Chief Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard is once again after an escaped fugitive. Mark Sheridan has escaped from a plane wreck and is on the run for a crime he did not commit and Gerard with his team is close behind. Sheridan must find a way to avoid the Marshals and find out who really committed the crime he has been framed for. The action is well placed coming in short spurts except for maybe the plane wreck and works exceptionally well with the story.The acting is exceptionally well done with Jones and Snipes giving some of there best performers in a long time. Tommy Lee Jones is quick thinking and likable in his role as Gerard and eventually works into be your favorite character. Snipes is only seen in short spirits until about the last 20 minutes which adds to the effect of him being evasive to the Marshalls. However in his short scenes he is able to fit into the role with relative ease.The action sequences as I said is very well done and never over done. They are fastpaced and well acted. The special effects are also quite believable. With the excellent acting gripping plot and fast paced action sequences the two hours fly by and make for a very enjoyable film.3 125 Stars".

It worked as Jones and company Joe Pantoliano and others are just as much fun to watch as they were in The Fugitive.There are many similarities to the latter especially in the first third of the film featuring some tremendous action scenes.

The only bit that irked myself and other hard core fans of 'the team' in this film is the fact that they killed off the always lovable baby faced Newman played by Tom Wood who is gaining a foothold in the acting business His death sparked a great deal of conversation FanFiction writing and an online 'funeral' held by the fans believe it or not!So if you are a great lover of the work that Tommy Lee Jones produces or you just like a cool action movie U.S. Marshals is a good step away from reality.

All the characters are fantastic! and the story is awesome! plus Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes are simply amazing in this!. It's quite underrated in my opinion and i thought Wesley Snipes made a very sympathetic fugitive in my opinion! plus The finale is surprising and very exciting!. A lot of people complained that Tommy Lee Jones was on auto pilot here i completely disagree while he wasn't as good as his Oscar worthy performance in the Fugitive he was still amazing and it's unpredictable throughout for the most part! plus the plain crash sequence was just crazy! and very exciting stuff. It started out a bit disappointing but then really picks up for the rest of the film and i thought Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in his role! plus the chase sequences were just excellent! in my opinion!. This is not as good as The Fugitive but it's still a fantastic sequel with tense and exciting action and 2 amazing performances from Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes! and i say Go see it now!. The Direction is fantastic!. Stuart Baird does a fantastic job here with awesome camera work fantastic angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The acting is wonderful!. Tommy Lee Jones is amazing as always and is amazing here he is very intense likable had some cool lines was fascinating to watch and despite what people say he was not on Auto pilot he gave it his all in my opinion and while he didn't deliver an Oscar worthy performance like he did in the fugitive he was still amazing! Tommy Lee Rules!!!. Wesley Snipes is also amazing as always here he played a very sympathetic Fugitive in my opinion was very likable smart and just did anything to survive he is also very charismatic and was perfect for this role! it's one of his best performances! Snipes Rules!!!!. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent in his role here he played it very low key but it worked and made his character mysterious and very interesting i loved him!. Joe Pantoliano is great in his role i liked him lots. Daniel Roebuck did what he had to do well which was not much. Kate Nelligan is excellent as the U.S marshal she was likable an had some good scenes with Tommy Lee i just wished she had more screen time. Tom Wood Dep. marshal Noah NewmanMarie BineauxSnipe's girlfriend Donald Gibb and the rest all do great with what they had to do!. Overall Go see it now!.  out of 5".

	onyx:emotionText "u.s. marshals was a very good movie  great performances by wesley snipes and especially tommy lee jones when hasn't he given an impressive performance??? cool fx and semisuspenseful action  but it's been done before and better in the form of the fugitive 1993. i am a big fan of the harrison ford flick and compared to that this film is trailing far behind. i particularly liked the cemetery scene and the chase scene in the senior's home but i didn't feel there was nearly enough suspense and intense action as there could have been like in the film before it. i liked this film a lot but i wasn't blown away like i was when i saw the previous. maybe it's because harrison is absent i don't know. it just didn't live up to my expectations. don't get me wrong it's a good film  much better than some of the slop that came out this year godzilla comes to mind  haven't seen it but i haven't heard one positive word about it  but i think it could have been much more suspenseful and also better writing would have helped.i give u.s. marshals 7 out of 10 for great performances particularly tommy lee jones's and cool fxchase scenes.mswelles";

It is definitely not as good or as original as The Fugitive but it is an action movie that has everything an action movie is supposed to have. It has action a bit of humour not bad acting actors and it is thrilling. If you like The Fugitive  you will probably like this one too but not as much as The Fugitive. In The Fugitive the actors are way better and it is a more original movie. U.S. Marshals is a sequel so you should not expect something great. I rated this movie 810.".

It seems like everyone was looking for a twist in the plot like E.T. coming back and Gerard running after him.  Get over it.  This was a great movie with a start middle and end.  That's it. Bringing back the original cast was a good idea.  The only downsize to this movie was the shooting and killing of someone very close to the Marshals' office.  A very cute one indeed.

I simply wasn't interested so I avoided it for years. Until one night when I saw it on television and it seemed wholly different than I thought it would be. I didn't get to finish the movie so I went and bought it at the video warehouse one Saturday. I watched and from the first scene I remembered what it was from t.v. it was superbly made.Samuel Gerard Joneshas been alerted about a new case. He and his crew are back on line chasing a different 'Fugitive'. Tommy for me the first time I remember him was in JFK. He played the old perverted business man Clay Shaw who was also Clay Bertrand. No matter how you can slice him he always ends up even! Tommy Lee Jones is a believable authority figure who seems fair and very balanced. Until he plays a maniac or something else then he is exactly that who ever he is put into. I truly enjoyed Wesley Snipes in this tail of 'trailing'. I'm not really too much a Snipes 'Fan' just a hand full of things he has done that I liked however he was the perfectly 'pitched' guy for 'U.S Marshals'. With Daniel Roebuck and Joe Pantoliano on the crew with him plus Noah NewmanTom Woodwho is a great 'Posse' member with Gerard. The funny thing is I can hardly stand anything that Robert Downy Jr. does. From all the trouble he is constantly into and the drugs etc. But for this role he was fantastic in it. I wouldn't see anyone too many other actors doing this character what it needed quite like Special Agent 'Royce' turned out! The director did a righteous job of putting these characters in perfect order and exacting development of them. The highline action that took place was quite a rush! I enjoyed the energy that the whole cast gave off as they tracked Mark Snipes through the 'jungle' of the city. He gave chase and the Marshals followed in heated pursuit! The film was a thing of beauty that seems for new film makers that it is becoming harder and harder to bring out a solid hit that will stand the test of years to come. I didn't like that we lost the 'kid' Tom Wood's character Noah in the shootout toward the end. I still had to give it a ten though. Even though I thought that Noah Newman should have been there celebrating with his team. But allinall Baird the director made a good choice in the way it all ended. I don't want to blow it for anyone not that I think that should deter anyone from enjoying outstanding performances from all thank you Stuart Baird as well! But through and through this was a real tough showstopping action extravaganza! Barnone.I recommend this to all Tommy Lee Jones or Wesley Snipes fans and to others looking for an intriguing story. Even if you just like him you'll probably love this! ".

	schema:reviewBody "Since I first watched it as a rented video on September 6 1999 it became a classic action Few movies have that rank in my book. Here the journey of Marshal Samuel Gerard continues yet with another fugitive. Most of Hollywood sequels are badlywritten pretty hasty and repeating its original at best. But this time it even outclassed its original. The Fugitive was wellmade entertainment however too long somehow uninteresting with Mr. Ford not to mention that I remember falling asleep in front of it at the first watching! While I have been hooked by U.S. Marshals for countless times.Tommy Lee Jones returns to the character that brought him the Oscar. That reminded me of Charles Laughton when he won the Oscar for portraying Henry VIII in The Private Life of Henry VIII  1933 then returned to the same character again in Young Bess  1953. There is a certain love for the Oscar's part I suppose. Yet aside from that I believe Jones loved to come back because how he and Gerard are very damn alike. The first always says I do not have a sense of humor of any recognizable sort Harrison Ford said once Acting with him is like having a fork in your back all the time and Will Smith has stated that He's my buddy but it's hard to be a friend of someone who doesn't lie at all !. So I think Tommy one way or another was playing himself. Or maybe he gave the character a lot of his own.I liked the character's reactions. When he was told He's dangerous armed welltrained what will you intent to do? he replayed simply and seriously  catch him ! not catch him badly or the son of bitch is mine or I'm the one who's going to learn this sucker the meaning of PAIN ! to the end of the Dirty Harry SuperCops I'm The Man dictionary in any other American action. Or when he was among the investigators in Irene Jacob's apartment notice well that he doesn't speak unless for harmless remakes looking the most kind or naive one in the bunch till the end of the scene. Or when he comes to his senses near the climax choosing not to kill the fugitive. Over and above Jones mastered some good physical efforts as well. However Jones is accused of repeating himself. While being a master actor every now and then he's forced to do the same thing again. For instance he was the man who chases the innocent till he catches him then convinces his innocence in The Fugitive. Then the same man yet with a love interest and a desire to avenge in U.S. Marshals. Then he sort of remade it again yet with a fugitive woman in Double Jeopardy. And he did it once more with less talk and more action in The Hunted ! It's full of perfect chases. The long sequence in the movie's middle is superb I don't remember anything like it in The Fugitive !. The problem is that the climax looks so pale compared to it. All the cast did their best. Yes Irene Jacob was nothing but the escapee's charming scared girl The way most of the American movies deal with talented European actresses. But what the heck it's an action and nothing wrong with seeing such a sensitive eyeful like her in it. OH MY GOD she looked uniquely sexy in that short black dress and that short black hair too. The dialog was close to spontaneous representing hot honest and funny moments all the conversations between Jones  Joe Pantoliano. This script was accurate. Even the idiot points such as arresting Wesley Snipes' character because of the medicine he takes have been presented fast enough so you couldn't glimpse. No wonder since director Stuart Baird was originally one of Hollywood topnotch editors for 2 decades before becoming a director in the mid90s.I recall the authentic poster in the video store back then. It had just small photo for Jones looking sullen and the rest of it was for Snipes jumping from the roof. I bet the movie makers were proud of themselves for make this astonishing stunt in specific. Although it got my admiration but I have to hate the fact that the movie gave up one shot in which Snipes salutes Jones sarcastically a la' military way while he's above the train I deem it the best finish to this outrageous sequence. Though you'd never find it unless in the movie's trailer !OK now for something magical. While I watched the movie 3 times already I didn't notice something that even at the fourth time my mom was the one who noticed it and told me after Jones discovered the truth of Downey. Jr he tricks him like adept magician emptying Downey's gun in front of him and us while no one is looking. The thing is how Jones was that charismatic to pull the trick off so I  a pro viewer I think  didn't observe this and for many times too ?! It seems that the director betted on Jones's presence and he clearly won.Finally I liked the movie's sense of honoring starting from the slightly strange title to the last scene with Jerry Goldsmith's tune crowns the victorious marshals. Yes it's a sequel straight action Hollywood stuff but not with the bad reputation of that. And Jones Gerard both were great.".

	schema:reviewBody "The sequel to the 1993 hit move The Fugitive couldn't get any better. U.S. Marshals is way more high octane than the latter yet the twists and turns get very interesting. Wesley Snipes plays the fugitive on the lam and Tommy Lee Jones is once again the man on his trail. Unlike the first one with Harrison Ford Wesley Snipes plays a exMarine who accused of killing two DSS Agents. However when they bring along Special Agent John RoyceRobert Downey Jr. the story goes deeper. Samuel GerardJones wants the fugitive alive Royce on the other hand wants him dead! The New York scene is what I like. I like the part where MarkSnipes escapes death when he fights Royce and Royce kills NewmanTom Wood before his death he sees that Royce is no good. And I liked the part where Mark swings on down to the train station on a cable. That's what I call an adrenaline rush. Imagine if Sam Gerard went out and killed Mark Roberts he would have sorry. Quickthinking came in handy when he found out about Royce and his hardcore hardnosed attitude saved the day. I'm very surprised that he forgave Mark for shooting him. If he didn't shoot Gerard he would've been still in jail. Well a sequel was worth making and it was a lot of fun to watch all the way through. Go for it and see it! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars!".

I had no interest in its existence and even less inclination to see it.

The remake not only captures and enhances the memory and feel of the original in many ways it is vastly better!

The time machine itself understandably with today's fx potential creams Rod Taylor's 1960 miniumbrella!  Mark Addy makes a great Philby very much in the style of Alan Young's original characterisation. Nice touch too having him cameo here as the florist!

Jeremy Irons' small but significant role comes off well too!I read complaints about the Morlock makeup? Hello?  any of you ever SEEN a Morlock? No???  well then kindly refrain from negative comment. These guys looked and moved way better than the little furry 1960 creations! I liked also the intent NOT to have Pearce able to reverse the death of his fiancee  that was heightened awareness on someone's part!Add to the above a superb musical score and if this doesn't all make for an entertaining and thought provoking film hey guys you're hard to please.

	schema:headline " GOOD ENTERTAINING FUN  but the 1960 Version is Still Tops";
	schema:reviewBody "This version of the H.G. Wells classic is quite different from the wonderful 1960 movie starring Rod Taylor. As such it remains entertaining but is rather more superficial. Nonetheless I enjoyed it. This one is set in Manhattan instead of London and the Wintry scenes of New York a century ago were nicely done.  Instead of bemoaning the current dismal state of the world as in the 1960 version our current hero wellplayed by Guy Pearce seeks to go back in time to prevent the untimely death of his beloved fiance. When he discovers this is impossible he seeks resolution in the future. The special effects of course are good as he moves into that future although the Geologic changes depicted could never have occurred in less than tens of millions of years.In the future 800000 from his present following a calamity involving the destruction of much of the moon that nearly destroyed Earth that in lieu of the nuclear holocaust in the 1960 version he discovers the Eloi now cliffdwellers who are indeed still there although now instead of looking like blonde blueeyed Aryans they are a nice Politically Correct cafe au lait color. Curiously there seems to have been no change or improvement in this species despite those 800000 years  evolution has apparently ceased. But that was how it was with the 1960 film in fact this type of Eloi is more intelligent and activeminded than the nearly braindulled zombies Rod Taylor discovered. They must have been more intelligent as they somehow got the steel handcuffs off our hero that had been placed there in the earlier scene in the past.This version is far kinder to the Eloi our hero never feels rage at how they squandered the knowledge and history of civilization. Yes books have crumbled but there is a photonic humanlike computer device a remnant of the New York Public Library which contains every shred of information ever collected. How its power source remains  up and running in a Stone Age world is never explained. Selfcontained power perhaps?!The evil Morlocks are still around and have evolved but instead of menacingly appearing at night or sounding sirens resulting in the Eloi marching catatonic and transfixed to their cannibalistic doom the Morlocks now attack in broad daylight  and they are very muscular and athletic. In fact we discover that those are just one type of Morlock  others include those who have emphasized their intellectual development instead of brawn and Jeremy Irons does a great job as the spooky albinolike head Morlock the uberMorlock. The scary hidden menace of night in the Taylor version in the world of the Eloi is missing from this film unfortunately.Our hero's final battle was quite different from the other versions and featured an altering of the futurepresent I still don't entirely understand. But it was compelling and dramatic.I missed the thoughtful tone of the 1960 film in which Taylor as George discussed Time as a Fourth Dimension and had a close relationship over the years with his friend Filby and later his son. The scenes where he stopped his Time Machine inside his old boarded up house seventeen years into the future are regretably gone  too slow for today's audience as perceived by the producers. It all created for me a nostalgic even elegiacal emotion I missed in this movie. The end scene where Taylor returned to bring back three books for his life with the Eloi is not in the 2002 film.The wellknown symbolism in the Wells' book and somewhat in the 1960 version of an Upper Class feeding off the labor of the Working Class cannot be seen at all in this current movie. That despite it being ably directed at least in part by his greatgrandson Simon Wells.The performances are generally quite good. Besides the wonderful Mr Irons Guy Pearce is excellent as Alexander Hartdgen. Samantha Mumba is credible as the the replacement for Yvette Mimieux's Weena  now called Mara. Her actual younger brother plays her film sibling. Although she is an Irish singer she is also half African thus satisfying the PC need for the correct complexion. Mark Addy is limited by the script as Filby in the 1960 version Alan Young was wonderful in that role.Scenery sets art direction and special effects are all quite good.This film was entertaining and enjoyable. I just wish it had also been also as thoughtprovoking for me as the 1960 Rod Taylor version had been. I know comparisons can be invidious but they can't be helped when remaking a classic. Nonetheless worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " 90 minutes of pure fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Judging from the initial reaction to THE TIME MACHINE it seemed official to me that people have forgotten how to have a good time at the theaters these days. But the surprising box office performance in the week following its release seems to now suggest otherwise.This is a really fun movie. It's a tad slow at first but since it's only a short 96 minutes things get going pretty quick. Guy Pearce is wellcast as the slightlynerdy mathmetician Alexander Hartdegen and the special effects were very welldone some were shown unfinished in the trailer and in the TV spots so don't let that deter you. Two of the best sequences are the two forwardtraveling sequences the first when Pearce begins his journey into the future with the change from Victorian era to the future flashing by before us during a terrific pull back from the time machine all the way out of Earth's orbit and around to the far side of the moon where a ship is coming in for a landing on a colony. The second is when Alexander is knocked unconscious by an explosion tremor in the distant future when explosives mining on the moon have knocked it from its orbit and have caused it to come apart showering the Earth with moonrocks and the time machine speeds forward into the very distant future. It's a terrific sequence in which we see the geological evolution of the area in a matter of moments from cliffside rock formations taking shape to environmental changes and everything in between. A truely aweinspiring moment that is one of ILM's finest effects sequences.I also liked how they kept a lot of elements from the original good friend Mr. Philby the spider making a web at the top of Alex's greenhouse the constantlychanging store window mannequin that appears in the building across from Alex's house the stop at one point in the future to discover that a disastrous incident is occuring nuclear war in the original the moonrock shower in this version and the entrance to the Morlock's underground lair. Even the talking rings in the original are sort of brought back though this time in the form of a holographic New York City public library computer Orlando Jones whom Alex first encounters in 2030 and again later in the film set nearly 800000 years later. The Eloi this time around are not all blonde and lifeless. In the original they calmly walk into the Morlock's lair when the horns sound. Here they run fearingfor the lives when the Morlocks come to hunt. And the Morlock's are no longer the lumbering bodybuilders with green body paint and white fright wigs. Here they are taller moremuscular deadly creatures with an animallike ferocity with incredible physical abilities and capable of fast speeds.I think this movie is a good example of what remakes should be. Keeping the concept and elements of the original while bringing to the material something new. Pearce as I said is wellcast as the time traveler who builds the machine first out of his desire to right a tragedy in his past then ends up traveling into the future. Samantha Mumba does a fine job in her first feature film role. I'm not too fond of singers who try to make the move to acting witness the debacles of Britney Spears Mariah Carey and countless rappers but Mumba was pretty good. I have a feeling we'll be seeing her more in the near future. Jeremy Irons' role was too brief though. Being the UberMorlock I was hoping for more screen time as well as a lengthier confrontation. But he was still good. If I didn't know it was him I never would have guessed it. Much to my surprise his performance is a very restrained one never exploding into one of those bursting overthetop speeches about wanting to overtake the planet. I was also expecting him to attempt to use the time machine to travel back to the past and take control in a time when there were more resources but that idea again much to my surprise and delight never even comes up. He seemed pretty content just doing things in the time he was in. Still I would have liked for him to had more screen time.I was also very impressed with the score by newcomer Klaus Badelt who has worked mostly in association with composer Hans Zimmer providing Additional Music from films liked HANNIBAL and GLADIATOR. His score here is full of action and emotion with a heroic main theme and a really nice African tribelike sound for the Eloi. I look forward to the release of the soundtrack and I'll be keeping a watch for his future projects. He sounds very promising.My only real complaint is that it all goes by too fast. A full two hours would have been great.In comparison between this one and the original film I suppose some people would say it lacks the charm of the first. The original despite some dated effects is still a good movie with the alwaysreliable Rod Taylor. I grew up with it on video so I consider it a childhood favorite. But I also enjoyed this version for the funfilled actionpacked piece of entertainment that it is.".

I look forward to the release of the soundtrack and I'll be keeping a watch for his future projects. He sounds very promising.My only real complaint is that it all goes by too fast. A full two hours would have been great.In comparison between this one and the original film I suppose some people would say it lacks the charm of the first. The original despite some dated effects is still a good movie with the alwaysreliable Rod Taylor. I grew up with it on video so I consider it a childhood favorite. But I also enjoyed this version for the funfilled actionpacked piece of entertainment that it is.";

	schema:reviewBody "Any movie version of The Time Machine' is destined to suffer from the structural inadequacies contained in the original source material H. G. Wells' 19th Century novel of the same name.  The previous 1960 George Pal version could not overcome them and neither can this current update written by John Logan and directed by Gore Verbinski and Simon Wells. Credit the filmmakers for resisting the modern temptation to transpose Wells' original tale to a contemporary setting.  The story still begins in the 1800's with scientist Alexander Hartdegen Guy Pearce replacing Rod Taylor in the role creating a machine with the capability of transporting him back and forth in time.  Unlike in the original film version however Hartdegen is not motivated by sheer scientific inquisitiveness alone.  The writer has provided him with an added personal inspiration for his endeavors in the form of a beautiful young fianc who is tragically murdered at the moment of their engagement.  Hartdegen's overwhelming desire to find a way to return to the past as a way of rewriting the future provides the necessary motivation to get the story rolling.  The structural problem alluded to in the opening paragraph boils down to the simple fact that The Time Machine' is by its very nature a tale in which the first and second acts will always far outshine the third although regrettably the third act always ends up taking the bulk of any adaptation's running time.  The story is at its most intriguing and compelling in the setting up stage and in the scenes depicting the actual time traveling experience this was the case in the first version and it is the case here as well.  We watch in awe as Hartdegen races across the millennia seeing life from a strangely spedup perspective the special effects here are very impressive.  We also enjoy the little side forays he takes into the early 21st Century where he visits a modernized New York City of 2030 and a few years down the road a world threatened by a disintegrating moon.  Less compelling is Hartdegen's eventual destination the world 800000 years in the future.  Those familiar with the earlier version will know all about the earth he ends up encountering one in which the peaceloving land dwelling Elois have become fodder for the cannibalistic subterranean Morlocks a grim product of evolutionary or should we say devolutionary development.  Just parenthetically one is struck here by just how heavily Pierre Boulle borrowed' from Wells when constructing his plot for Planet of the Apes.'  Given the obvious limitations of this rather hopeless final act the makers of this version haven't done a bad job bringing it to the screen since there really isn't much one can do with it but to turn the whole thing into an extended chase scene anyway.  The odd passivity of the Elois in acquiescing to their decreed nutritional fate was however captured to greater effectiveness in the 1960 version.  One felt caught off balance by the sight of all those people resigning themselves to the inevitable while affording no sympathy for the loved ones' who were the Morlock's victims.  As partial compensation for missing this intriguing aspect the new film does make the Morlocks appear rather more threatening than they did in the Pal version.  However Jeremy Irons as the representative of the intelligentsia' branch of the Morlock race comes in way too late in the story to register effectively and the climax of the film is both confusing and inexplicable to put it politely.  There is however a nice coda at the very end merging both time periods into a shared spatial dimension.  The least believable aspect of this current edition is the fact that the few Elois who still speak English 800000 years in the future  an absurd notion in its own right  could give Professor Henry Higgins a run for his money in the elocution department.  We should all possess their pitchperfect pronunciation command of diction and level of vocabulary.Guy Pearce isn't given much opportunity to act in this role and I must say that in his beardless state at least his gaunt countenance is almost frightening to gaze upon at times.  I don't know what might have happened to him in the year or so since he appeared in Memento' but someone needs to buy that poor boy a substantial meal from time to time.  In some of the early scenes in the film in particular he looks positively freakish.  I kept looking for signs of deliberate tampering by the makeup artists and wondered how some future alteration in his appearance might play a significant role in the narrative's development.  It never happened which leads me to wonder if Pearce might not himself be morphing into a Morlock.Special mention must me made of the superb art direction that adorns the film.  The sets depicting 19th Century New York City are particularly impressive.Overall The Time Machine' does a better job revisiting its source material than Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes' did last year.  That may indeed be faint praise  but praise nonetheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 2002 version of The Time Machine is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects. What a lousy uninspired bland story with no imagination. Why so totally rewrite such a wonderful scifi classic? Are today's movie audiences too hip for the H.G. Wells writing largely as is? The 1960 George Pal version told a much more endearing story even with clunky lowbudget effects beachparty looking Eloi and Morlocks that looked like Smurfs on steroids.The 2002 version must have H.G Wells turning in his grave1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old scifi clich. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara what happened to Weena?! that made the 1960 version so endearing. This sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant either he or his buddy Einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma  not have it dawn on him 800000 yrs in the future  from a Morlock no less Doh!! What's wrong with timetraveling just for fun  adventure  curiosity  as embodied in the 1960 version?2. Only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what Pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it. The George Pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of 'travel' though a 4th dimension.3. The director goes out of his way to make Pearce's character look geeky a worn out old stereotype of scientists. In the 1960 version Rod Taylor was a little nerdy too at least around Weena but managed to be swashbuckling playful and charming.4. Among the key themes of the 60's version  abandoned in the remake  is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Blowing up the Moon to destroy humanity is pointless  and doesn't do much for science literacy. For over 4 billion years the Moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes science fiction needs artistic license but this is just plain dumb and meaningless.5. Destroying the time machine is stupid too. Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is sort of a copout 'machina ex machina' Disappointingly Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends a key part of the Wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.6. Having Morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins H.G. Wells' wonderfully spooky ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night. A true cinematic opportunity lost. Also Wells depicted the Eloi as frail and childlike. These guys in the movie looked like they could take on Morlocks if they weren't such big baby wusses.7. The one smart Morlock  kind of a bleachedout Star Wars Evil Emperor  had potential but is so lame and aloof he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home ?! Boy what a dramatic high point! In the book the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it and fight to keep it.8. The goof ball hologram at the N.Y. Public Library is too much. It makes light of the idea of human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the talking rings that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind. Derailed evolution is serious stuff.Its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket  popcorn and go rent the DVD when it comes out soon no doubt at least you can fastforward thought the dull parts just like our time traveler.".

	schema:reviewBody "Problems with my health have meant that for almost five years I wasn't able to read books properly.  I used to love reading but eventually I had to accept that it was something I'd have to leave behind and I found instead a passion for film.  Earlier this year my health improved enough to get back into reading and The Time Machine by HG Wells was the first book I managed to get through.  For that reason it's a special book for me one that I'd recommend to everyone and defend against anyone who has a bad word to say about it.  Beyond what it means to me it's a masterpiece of science fiction from one of the genre's founding fathers.  For those reasons sitting through this adaptation was one of the most miserable experiences of my life.  I can't begin to express the utter contempt I have for this piece of garbage.Set in nineteenthcentury New York in the days before accents had been standardised this inane and inept adaptation takes Wells's genius and flushes it well and truly down the Hollywood bog.  It sees Dr Alexander Hartdegen tormented by a pointless backstory and driven to find a way of undoing the recent tragedy that only he cares about.  He invents a time machine powered by a dynamo attached to Wells's spinning corpse but finds he is unable to change the terrible past.  Helpfully mumbling exposition to himself he comes to realise that the only way to understand why the past can't be changed is to travel 800000 years into the future.  It was at that point that Mr Logic ran out of the cinema knowing he wouldn't be needed for the rest of the film.  I wish I'd followed him.Arriving in our distant future Hartdegen finds that the human race has evolved into two distinct species the peaceful beautiful Eloi and the evil subterranean Morlocks whose skin had longago turned into rather obvious latex.  Lazily  I mean luckily  the English language has survived 800000 years mostly intact and after a quick chat with one of the Eloi Hartdegen turns actionhero as he tries to free her people from the clutches of the Morlocks.This is a thoroughly useless adaptation one that leads me to believe that the screenwriter has never bothered to read the book but had instead just glanced at the plot summary on its back cover had a quick lobotomy and set to work on his screenplay.  Everything that made the novel so powerful has been lost.  The anonymity of the timetraveller has been replaced by a dithering scientist with a name and a backstory his parental affection for little Weena has been replaced with him wanting to do Mara the Eloi's laziness and lack of intelligence has been replaced with a paradoxical inventive and resourceful nature which throws up unanswered questions as to why they've failed to rebuild their society the Morlocks freed from the moral ambiguity that the novel had put forward are reduced to nothing but supernatural superhuman hissable baddies.  It was just horrifying to see a work of such genius simplified dumbeddown and turned implausible and lapped up by an audience of idiots including my own brother!  Adaptations don't have to be loyal and I understand that there are certain things that work in a novel that wouldn't work on screen but if things have to be added or removed the changes should at least be equal to the ideas they replaced. That just isn't the case here.And it's so Hollywood that the pursuit of science isn't enough Hartdegen can't invent a time machine simply out of the scientific curiosity it has to be motivated instead by a lost love.  And look at the difference between the book and the film in terms of imagination and invention  The book created a machine that could travel through time the movie has a holographic museum curator to dispense exposition.  The book was a powerful critique on the British class system the movie has a running joke about bowler hats.Even if you can see this as a film in itself rather than as an adaptation of another story it still fails.  It's ridden with plotholes crippled by the absence of logic and has a payoff that's so lazy it's a miracle it even bothered to turn up on time.  And while we see travel in the fourth dimension we only see characterisation in the first.  The leads are allocated one adjective each and accents that could be kindly described as welltravelled'.  The only real successes are the sweeping score by Klaus Badelt and the often stunning effects by the alwaysreliable ILM and Digital Domain.  Both were wasted in a  movie that was heartbreakingly bad.I've never been so upset by a film.  I've never spent so long with my head in my hands.  I'm sorry they did this to you Mr Wells.".

	schema:headline " Pretty Good Remake";
	schema:reviewBody "I was interested in seeing this remake simply to find out if it was as bad as a myriad of critics have suggested it to be . I did love the 1960 version and I am not keen on people remaking my favourite movies  but surely last years remake of HG Wells romantic fantasy wasnt going to be as bad as painted was it ?Herbert George Wells wrote the source novel so why not call the hero Herbert or George ? Its also a Victorian sounding name so whys the hero got a name that resembles Steve Martins character in THE MAN WITH TWO BRAINS ? This screenplay just like David Duncans from the 1960 version lacks an opening hook but it does speculate that even if time travel did exist it would be impossible to change ones destiny  an interesting thought . ScreenwriterJohn Logan adds a post modernist sequence featuring both HG Wells and STAR TREK . I didnt think the humour worked very well but I had to admire his cheek  and since everyone cycles everywhere Logan suggests that in the mid 21st century America has elected a president from the green party which no doubt caused civilisation to collapse . Like most other movies set in the far flung future there are illogical gaps in the screenplay . For example remnants of the present day would still exist . Put it like this  The pyramids of Egypt are a few thousand years old and at the present rate of degeneration they wont exist in a few thousand years but Alexander goes 798000 years into the future and the skeletal remains of 21st century New York still remain !  but as I said this is a common flaw in time travel stories as is the ridiculous notion that hundreds of thousands of years into the future people will still be able to understand and speak English  so this can be forgiven on the grounds of dramatic license . My only real criticism of the screenplay is that John Logan borrows a bit too much from Duncans earlier screenplay  otherwise this is a fairly good adaptation on Wells groundbreaking novel . Adding the ubermorlock is an inspired idea that works very wellIm in two minds who to credit  criticise as director . As you may know Simon Wells left the project days before the project was completed and was replaced by Gore Verbinski so for the purposes of this review Ill refer to the director simply as  The director   and the director does manage one show stopping moment as the camera pans out from Alexander at the end of the 19th century across an ever evolving landscape eventually stopping on a lunar colony . The most controversial aspect of the film seems to be the casting or more especially the casting of dark skinned actors as the eloi  but I fail to see what the problem is . The eloi live on the surface in bright sunlight so why shouldnt they be dark skinned ? Its also in keeping with the social darwinism of Wells novel . The eloi have evolved due to environment the same way as the ubermorlock has evolved  and social darwinism is totally amoral so theres no right or wrong  or good and bad involved . I do wish people would stop playing the race card . As for the ordinary morlocks theyre superbly designed with some great make up involved but the director throws a massive spanner in the works by having them running a hundred miles an hour and being able to jump great heights which suddenly makes them unconvincing which is a great pity  they would have worked better as men dressed up rather than CGI supermen . I did like Jeremy Irons as the scene stealing ubermorlock though . A word of warning for those of you who suffer from photo sensitivity  sadly once again this is a movie that heavily features strobe lighting . Im not epileptic which is just as well because I wouldnt want to risk a seizure watching THE TIME MACHINE . Sadly there seems to be more and more films being produced with this technique in style used and sadly Ive had to keep saying  Stop using strobe lighting in movies . Its totally irresponsible for directors to do this .To sum up the 2002 remake of THE TIME MACHINE was light years away from the debacle Id been led to expect . Its fairly good in its own right but not as good as George Pals 1960 version  maybe because it lacks the charm of the former  a charm that movie had in abundance  but this version is still pretty good as remakes go".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1960 version will always have a special appeal especially to those of us who remember the 1960s because we had not yet been bombarded by such time travel films as Back to the Future and others. I recall seeing it the first time with a great aura of fascination. Although based on the book the 2002 version does not try to follow it too closely.SPOILERS  In the current film the professor's incentive for perfecting the time machine resulted from his girlfriend's Sienna Guillory untimely death at the gun of a petty thief 4 years later he was determined to travel back and change the circumstances to save her and marry her. But when he does she dies in a different manner. Instead of going back and trying again shades of Groundhog Day he quickly figures out that one is not able to travel back and change history but he doesn't know why. So the rest of the film is his travel forward in search of that answer. Not sure why because knowing the answer may not change anything. Seems to me it would have been better to travel back 6 months or so marry his girlfriend immediately the travel back say 5 months everytime that fateful day approached so in theory they could live together forever that way! But I wasn't the director. HG Wells' great grandson was.More SPOILERS  So he travels forward. In 2037 he finds that a nuclear explosion on the moon went too far and it was breaking up and falling to Earth. An accident in his time machine knocked him out he inadvertently went forward 800000 years found the moon event had resulted in two races those above ground and the underground Morlocks who used the Eloi for food. There in a conversation with the Uber Morlock who knew everything about the professor he learned why he couldn't change history to be with his girl. The only reason he invented the time machine was because his girl was killed so if that event were changed then there never would have been a reason for a time machine so he could never have traveled back to reverse her death  a paradox that he could not ever overcome.The changes in the story are fine however the overall film could have been executed much better. In particular the Morlocks evolved into some vicious creatures that didn't make a lot of sense and their CGI movements were not realistic at all and the quality not consistent with the rest of the film. Still I found it a worthwhile 90 minutes of entertainment.  The DVD is fine there are several interesting extras.".

The movie and other versions of it I feel should all be seen. This is because I found it very intriguing seeing the advancement from how the world was when H.G.

Wells book but in my opinion that does not detract from the movie.  I thought the Orlando Jones character of Vox was quite interesting and amusing and Jeremy Irons definitely deserved more screentime as he is a superb actor in every role he takes on.  The character development was a little weak but it was tricky with the time travel aspect.  I found the special effects to be good it is difficult to measure up to some of the special effects that have come out recently and I think they did a good job.  With every new movie that comes out you have increasingly more spectacular visual effects especially with the higher budget films.  All in all I think that the actors did a good job and the movie kept me interested the whole time and was especially good in some parts.  I would definitely recommend this movie and I give it 8 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just don't get it I really don't.There's all kinds of things wrong with this movie. The plot is fairly nonsensical the story is disjointed the early scenes are dragged out interminably before anything really interesting happens a lot of the dialogue is cheesy and inane and the the Morlocks look like they were designed by a senile makeup artist left over from the original series of Lost In Space.So why the hell did I love it so much? Let's break it down.1 The special effects are very very good. The time travel sequences are worth the price of admission alone especially during the lengthy journey from the early 21st century to the year 800000. It's a shame Guy Pearce was unconscious for most of the trip because he really would have enjoyed the scenery.2 The music is also excellent especially the haunting Eloi theme that plays through much of the second half. George Lucas must be kicking himself that he didn't hire the same composer to do the Ewok music in Return of the Jedi although even that wouldn't have saved the unbearably stupid concept of a race of stone age teddy bears who can defeat a crack army of armoured guntoting soldiers by hitting them with sticks and rocks. But I digress.3 The reinvention of the Eloi as a tribe of noble primitives was a good move since a race of futuristic Aryans in togas would have A been terribly dated and corny and Bensured the arrival of James T Kirk in search of an easy lay.By the way I really want to live in that cliff village of theirs even if rolling out of bed in the middle of the night would be instantly fatal.4 Samantha Mumba is a babe plain and simple. Not only that but she also provides one of the better performances in the movie. I've read some damning comments about the acting ability of the divine Miss Mumba which I don't really understand. Presumably it's because her subtle thoughtful and believable performance is such a stark contrast to the shameless overacting of Guy Pearce Jeremy Irons and Orlando Jones. All three are brilliant actors to be sure but they don't half ham it up in this flick.Well alright Irons hams it up in EVERY flick.As a side note casting Mumba's reallife sibling Omero as her character's younger brother was a stroke of genius. Not only does it make their relationship believable but the boy's a better actor than many people twice as old and five times as famous as him. And his hairdo is frickin' awesome.All in all what should have been a really bad movie turned out to be one of the most entertaining flicks I've watched in a long time. And not just because of Samantha Mumba in skimpy clothing although that obviously didn't hurt matters.".

All three are brilliant actors to be sure but they don't half ham it up in this flick.Well alright Irons hams it up in EVERY flick.As a side note casting Mumba's reallife sibling Omero as her character's younger brother was a stroke of genius. Not only does it make their relationship believable but the boy's a better actor than many people twice as old and five times as famous as him. And his hairdo is frickin' awesome.All in all what should have been a really bad movie turned out to be one of the most entertaining flicks I've watched in a long time. And not just because of Samantha Mumba in skimpy clothing although that obviously didn't hurt matters.";

No doubt about it.Really this would have been a decent scifiadventure movie if it hadn't been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson.  I kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel. What resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardization.The novel is a great scifi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it probably because they read it when they're very young is that it's overflowing with social commentary.  The Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of Victorian England and the overall message of the film is that EVERYTHING DECAYS AND DEGENERATES a satiric jab at Victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever. There's no love story no romance with a beautiful Eloi woman....in the novel the Eloi are 3foottall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal.  The Time Traveler does befriend an Eloi woman but it's clear he thinks of her more like a pet and anyway she's killed before the novel ends.This movie first tries to give us a totally stupid backstory as to why he wants to travel through time.  The treacly romance and the Lessons He Must Learn are enough to make film fans vomit.The journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster.  OK not bad but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates as in the book.  More a reflection of the times I guess as the George Pal version had a nuclear war take place.The general story?  Ugh.  A total misrepresentation of the novel.  The Eloi are too competent and warlike.  The Morlocks are too intelligent.  The UberMorlock is an embarrassment and there's no setup.  He just shows up in time to be killed.  Yawn.Samantha Mumba does OK.  Guy Pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain.  Reportedly he broke a rib while filming this. He also looks unhealthy and overly thin as if he had been ill for a long time before making this.A sad sorry film version of one of the world's classics.  H. G.

	schema:reviewBody "I must confess that I march to a different drummer when it comes to this film. I enjoyed it for the most part and find it very clever in many aspects. The major drawback comes from the plot  it is far too simplistic for the elaborate care that went into both the visual aspect of the film as well as the nice touches at almost every turn.The plot is rather simple  Alexander Hartdegen a mechanical physics professor in turnofthecentury New York turn of the nineteenthintothetwentieth century that is has his head in his equations apart from one thing his love for Emma. When she is killed in a botched mugging yes New York at that time even had muggings in Central Park Hartdegen drops everything to invent the time machine he'd theorised in order to prevent Emma's death. He soon makes the discovery that it isn't possible to undo the past at least not that aspect of the past but becomes obsessed with finding the reason why. He speculates this is more likely to be answered in the future than in the past or present and thus goes forward in time. He makes a few stops along the way before arriving at a fardistant future nearly a million years in the future in which the human race has evolved into two distinct species  one on the surface and one below the earth.So far so good  departure from H.G. Wells' original classic a great piece of literature and from the earlier film but not beyond the pale. The effects here are truly stunning in many respects  the time machine itself is a marvel the DVD has a feature on the making of the machine and the time transformation scenes are very inspiring up to and including the zoomaway shot from the machine into the air all the way to the city on the moon. The Eloi city along the river is also a remarkable scene. The movie rightly won awards including the Academy Award for these effects. Unfortunately effects do not a movie make. This is where the plot failure comes into play.Hartdegen seems to give up far too early in trying to change the past and his relationships such as we get to see them in the future are very stilted. Jeremy Irons himself an Academy Award winner has precious little screen time to deliver what is perhaps the most anticlimactic resolutions I've seen in a long time. The overarching question should be 'why?' but seems to transformed into 'what if?' in an unclear way the deleted introductory scene available on the DVD helps to more firmly establish the question but alas it was deleted. Hartdegen remains in the future like Wells' and the earlier film's scientists albeit in a different way perhaps to help transform the future but we'll never know a sequel is not likely.Despite the thin plot what I found most enjoyable apart from the special effects were the clever touches here and there far too numerous to mention. When Hartdegen arrives in 2030 prompted by an advertisement proclaiming 'the future is now' he encounters a userfriendly library computer personified by Orlando Bloom with a real sense of humour and humanity. When Hartdegen asks about time travel the library computer even incorporates Star Trek gestures and sound effects into its discussion as well as the yetunwritten musical version of 'The Time Machine' by Andrew Lloyd Weber. One woman in the distant future speaks English now called the stone language for the stone engravings that remain from store fronts and the like but speaks without accent strange enough but even stranger that New Yorker Hartdegen sounds more British as does the Morlock leader Jeremy Irons.Indeed there are so many little pieces here is seems that the writers spent more time trying to incorporate bits of cleverness throughout the script than making sure the script as a whole had thorough soundness.Another piece I really liked was the music. The sombre brass tones the triumphant orchestral arrangements the folkmodern synthesis for the Eloi and the dramatic scoring really enhanced this film beyond measure. The DVD has bits of the score that replay on a loop sequence during menu screens and I've sometimes left these on to hear the pieces over and over again.The DVD has one of the better menu sequence setups I've seen simulating the machine effects in visuals and sound as well as incorporating score elements and special effects. DVD extras include the delete scene commentaries by many of the crew several pieces on the special effects including one on the time machine itself This is a fairly good film despite its flaws. Overall I would award it threeandahalf stars but will round up to four in honour of the effects the music and clever pieces.".

Wells.. he must be wearing grooves in his grave from all the spinning by now.About the only thing this film yet another attempt at an updated remake of George Pal's timeless 1960 feature has in common with his novel of the same name is tht there's a time machine in it the destination year of 802701 a race of people called Eloi another called Morlocks and hmm.. can't think of anything else!Pal's film is one of my favorites and as such this new one was a gross disappointment to me except for some very good effects sequences  the time travel and Moon shots.. in fact with a nice sharp pair of scissors I think I could edit this film down to about ten worthwhile minutes out of over two hours of padding and dreck.Wells' entire premise for his protagonist's time travel adventures is summarily thrown in the dumpster in favor of turning his driving motivation into a love story.  Fine make another movie out of that but it's not Wells' vision. SPOILERS AHEAD In Pal's 1960 classic Rod Taylor as Wells the time traveller was always VERY careful to lock his machine or remove its stick shift before leaving it.. here we have Guy Pearce getting out of his machine in 2030 and wandering through the NY Public Library for who knows how long leaving his machine in an alley way for anyone to stumble on and mess with.The device used to destroy humanity as we know it in the new film was a stunning idea but still it stretches the imagination to think that a 20 megaton bomb could split the Moon apart..Flash forward 800000 years and the Eloi this time around are a dark skinned race of shaved head tattooed jungle people whose most beautiful inhabitant is a Janet Jackson lookalike. Throw in a child actor for no good reason at all.And someone really has to explain to me how crumbled remains of New York could survive erosion winds the sands of time and glaciers for 8000 centuries while we watch rivers carve out entire valleys and mountains of rock blow away as so much dust.. if that isn't enough of a stretch explain to me how a holographic library docent could survive for 800000 years. Who was oiling his gears all that time? What was the power source that lasted that long?Even in the beautiful timetravel effects sequences nothing much makes sense.. as the scale of time keeps changing depending apparently on what the director wants you to dwell on.. if you're going into the future at such a rapid speed that you can see mountains erode in seconds you are not going to see individual trees spring up in a meadow.Okay so forget all that. Chalk it up to Hollywood not expecting its audience to ask such questions.  But why pollute Wells' classic story with new elements cut out of whole cloth and inserted for reasons we can only guess at?  There was no Uber Morlock in the book or the original film.And riddle me this  how did Pearce know what effect throwing his pocket watch into the gears of his time machine would have? Did he build a bunch of them and figure out ways he could make them explode back in 1900 first? The effects shot of him and Samba or Mumbo or whatever her name is jumping out of the blast field is nearly a direct ripoff of Arnold jumping out of the Predator's blast field at the end of that fine film.. Watch the bad guys get vaporized while the hero and his playmate barely escape.. sigh.. how many times have we seen this schtick?Some films are simply classics that do NOT need to be remade and 1960's The Time Machine was one of them.  Or if you're going to remake it at least be honest to the original like the 1980s remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers was.Otherwise please don't waste our time.Read the book and see the 1960 film if you really want to know what The Time Machine was about.".

Again most who attempt to stand on the shoulders of a great writer The wretched Planet of the Apes remake comes to mind stumble futilely. In this case there is a deeper message than the original story. The latter part of the movie drags a little bit before getting to that crux but it's worth it. As a product of the times H.G. Wells apparently sought out to write a story colorfully in order to voice his grievances against the inevitable idiocies of war. That message seems to still be an important one but this movie goes beyond that and says something about the human spirit and a thoughtprovoking perspective that makes fate not just war an inevitable result of the limitations of our own consciousness.There are also things which are done better in the original of course. This version gives the future a little bit too much hope and strays further from the original story than the 1960 version did. However that is just Hollywood's typical smudge...the story is still poignant. The soundtrack is also very good.One thing it could do without are a few line gimmicks like referencing Einstein just to illustrate the time traveler's intelligence...but again this is minute enough a detail that it is simply amusing and just shows the script was written dumbed down a little throughout which is typical.This remake is an exception because it adds something good to the original making them very similar yet very different such that both movies are compliments of each other.

His plan is relatively simple Two strangers each agree to kill someone the other person wants gone. For example Guy could kill his father and he could get rid of Guy's wife Miriam freeing him to marry Anne Morton the beautiful daughter of a U.S. Senator. Guy dismisses it all out of hand but Bruno goes ahead with his half of the bargain and disposes of Miriam. When Guy balks Bruno makes it clear that he will plant evidence to implicate Guy in her murder if he doesn't get rid of his father. Guy had also made some unfortunate statements about Miriam after she had refused to divorce him. It all leads the police to believe Guy is responsible for the murder forcing him to deal with Bruno's mad ravings.";

	schema:reviewBody "One would have expected Hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution.  Surely few expected his most riotous unrestrained film a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy exciting suspense mocking manipulation and astonishing flights of fancy.  But that is precisely what they got STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film.  Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life and hence the society he represents or is eager to join.  Guy is the archetypal American the workingclass boy made good moving in influential circles athletic successful handsome.  Bruno is his destructive opposite gay decadent 'European' he lives off his father in a Big House and just lounges about dreaming of murder.  Bruno's life is one of repetition circularity whereas Guy moves straight ahead.  It is Bruno's achievement to move Guy into his realm represented by the merrygoround and force HIM to transgress break the law hope for murder Bruno's.Bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy.  All the authority figures in the film are criticised  Bruno's father a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film especially in Aunt Clara's paintings  that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere Anna's incredibly Machiavellian selfserving father the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken.  Far from being the motherhater of legend Hitch as Robin Wood perceived is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy.Bruno's transgression turns the world topsyturvy.  This is Hitch's most surreal film.  Whenever Guy is in his plot he is filmed straight with conventionally romantic music.  But whenever Bruno intrudes the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque bizarre much more fun.  This is Hitch's first truly American film revelling in the primitive detritus of Americana.  Grown men puncture little boys' balloons or try to throw them off merrygorounds. Distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains.  Elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees.  Washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky like a haunting Dali painting.  There is one of the greatest and funniest scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless smiling Bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match an image worthy of Magritte.  Just look at any scene with Bruno in it and watch it derail into the bizarre.Phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations  check all those balloons Hitch had obviously just seen THE THIRD MAN  as well as in more staid environs Washington will never look the same again.  STRANGERS is also VERTIGO notwithstanding Hitch's most overtly sexual film  as well as the phalluses there is the sustained homoeroticism the remarkable play with 'riding' horses the gobsmacking fellatio joke when Hitch's daughter spills powder over the policeman.And yet Hitch doesn't stint on good old suspense.  In the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place.  Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates and Hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification willing Bruno into murder.  There is a hilariously painful sequence where Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame Guy down a drain.  The gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience I was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny slightly disturbing and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success.  And Hitch milks it with callous glee  listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously.STRANGERS is one of Hitch's five best films and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema.  The dialogue is so strange and brilliant I can't believe it wasn't written by Chandler.  Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful imp standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts Guy.  The fairground finale is a remarkable dizzying fusion of exciting tense setpiece black comedy and symbolic site.  If Bruno's final words condemn him to hell according to the Catholic precepts Hitch is supposed to embody compare with a similar ending in THE KILLERS we applaud his integrity infinitely preferable to Guy's debased serving of self.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time. One film that tends to get somewhat lost under the Vertigo's and the Psycho's is this film Strangers on a Train the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever made. The story follows Guy Haines a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the Senator's daughter if he can get a divorce from his current wife. One day on the way to see his wife he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall and one that could ultimately cost him his life.The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinema's most intriguing and thought provoking of all time. What if two people swapped murders thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime and rendering their motive irrelevant? Could this truly be the perfect murder? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is lead into could happen to any normal everyday person. Everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his? The chances of it happening are unlikely but it's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of Strangers on a Train and in this situation anyone could. Is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony any better than Robert Walker? The man was simply born for the part. He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in. The character of Bruno is a madman but he's not a lunatic he's a calculating conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable. His performance is extremely malevolent and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality. Unfortunately Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train and I believe that is a great loss to cinema. Nobody in the cast shines as much as Walker does but worth mentioning is his costar Farley Granger. Granger never really impresses that much but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against Walker. Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person and that is how it should be. Ruth Roman is Guy's wife to be. She isn't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression but she makes the best of what she has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter Patricia takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara the sister of Guy's fianc. She is suitably lovely in this role and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in.Alfred Hitchcock's direction is always sublime and it is very much so in this film. There is one shot in particular that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. Hitchcock's direction is moody throughout and very much complies with the film noir style. The climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting and I don't think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film. It's truly overblown and out of turn from the rest of the movie but it works. There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time and the reason for that is that he doesn't only use the script to tell the film's story but he also uses to camera to do so as well. Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. Its story is both intriguing and thought provoking and is sure to delight any fan of cinema. A masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strangers on a Train is a brilliant example of what Hitchcock could do best continually develop his plot and characters in an atmosphere both creepy and humorous. The film has great dialogue superb characters good acting and naturally superb direction from the master of suspense who is truly at his best here. Robert Walker's Bruno Anthony is a character few will forget he is creepy psychopathic and as M. Night Shyamalan says on one of the DVD's special features it is the fact that he has moral standards however unconventional and disturbed they may be that makes him such a dangerous man. Strangers is a truly involving film one that takes you on a ride you won't forget anytime soon it has one of the best examples of buildup you could find on film and as soon as it ends the film takes you on a journey that entertains and terrifies and even makes you laugh. This is a truly brilliant example of filmmaking every shot is drenched in suspense every cut is masterful every detail important every second exciting it never lets go till the very end and what an ending that is a delicious bit of humor that is perfectly in tone with the rest of this delightful masterpiece.Some have criticized Farley Granger's performance as Guy Haines but it really is quite perfect he delivered all his lines well and makes us feel honestly sympathetic towards him. Robert Walker is simply genius as Bruno Anthony a great character that wouldn't have been nearly as memorable without Robert Walker's devilishly evil portrayal of him. The supporting cast are good Ruth Roman Leo G. Carroll Kasey Rogers Howard St. John and Patricia Hitchcock all deliver good performances that enhance what was already a good film and make it a great film. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is as always sublime.What makes Strangers so good is the simple plot. It isn't a complicated story two strangers meet on a train and one comes up with a crazy plot You do my murder I do yours. One takes it as a joke and shrugs it off but the other takes himself seriously and goes on to commit the murder he offered to getting the 'good guy' into huge trouble. The script is adapted superbly well by Whitfield Cook from a novel by Patricia Highsmith.This is really one of Hitchcock's most interesting films from a technical perspective while also providing more than enough laughs suspense and thrills to keep just about anybody engaged.1010".

I finally watched it a few weeks ago and as always with any Hitchcock movie it not only stood up to the test of time it far surpassed most thrillers being made today. You can see the inspiration for future action movies here  the climactic ending with the outofcontrol merrygoround and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's Speed. Of course Strangers is over forty years older than Speed and contains no modern special effects but the visceral thrill is there  Hitchcock was a true genius.The notsosubtle gay side of Bruno Robert Walker in an amazing performance has taken form in many other psychostalkerfigures in future movies. Consider him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in Single White Female. He knows about Guy before he even meets him on the train  we almost get the feeling their contact isn't incidental  and is soon entirely obsessed with him.Hitchcock loved the Oedipial elements in his movies also see Psycho for more blatant undertones and there's a lot of that here. Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother. His effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951 when gays were not allowed to be portrayed on the screen  yet Hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see Bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very nonmasculine robe flirting with Guy and responding to his mother.The deep layers of this movie make it a fastpaced thriller than you can return to again and again  unfortunately it's being remade as a bigbudget Hollywood production but after seeing the original I honestly can't imagine anything surpassing the sheer whiteknuckle thrills of this movie.".

	schema:headline " One of his best";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a little known Hitchcock movie but I think it is one of his best. I like how he inserts humor into this crime drama. For example the small boy pointing a gun at the Bruno character at the carnival and the Bruno character popping his balloon with a lit cigarette. And there is the comic scene at the tennis courts where the audience in unison moves there heads back and forth following the ball except for Bruno who glances straight away at the tennis player. Hitchcock plays suspense masterfully as in the tunnel of love sequence early in the film. We know that Bruno plans to murder the woman and we 'see' that is why he  is following her into the tunnel. We hear a scream and think the deed is done when voila! the girl comes sailing out with her two admirers. Then there is one of the finest scenes in all movie history the final scene on the carousel. Hitchcock manages suspense on many nonstop levels the two protagonists fighting each other a small boy who nearly falls from the ride as it whirls at tremendous speed and the elderly man who crawls beneath the carousel to try and get at the brakes. Although I think the end of the scene was a bit over the top it was masterful to that point and I will never forget it.I was surprised to see Ruth Roman in the lead. Usually Hitchcock has blondes for his leads but the commentator on the TMC channel told us Hitch had to use her because she was under contract to the studio where he filmed it.I highly recommend this obscure Hitchcock masterpiece and give 9.99 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Overall Strangers on a train is a good movie with amazing cinematography suspense and a good plot. Obviously it is a classic which might be the reason why reviews here are so overly positive. Brunos character is well thought and acted out. The rest of the characters are a little flat and react as you would expect them to for most of the film. Yes the tennis scene might be a little long but then again the film was made a long time ago. By then films had longer shots and scene a slower pace no cgi and in general less graphic detail. So for its time I believe the tennis scene is brilliant at building suspense.But what really is the big big flaw of strangers on a train is that there continue to be scenes that don't seem to make any sense whatsoever and are quite disturbing to watch. Most people here didn't seem to notice that thoughIt already starts off a bit shakybut still relatively OK compared to what is still to come when Bruno kills the wife. For some reason he chooses a carnival as the crime scene. Lots of people light and not exactly great for an escape. He doesn't seem to mind following her the whole time by which point her company must have noticed him and would be great witnesses. Although his escape by boat may seem a little inconvenient he is lucky and nobody seems to mind that he just boats back from the island where people are yelling for help and he can just walk away from the crime scene.So then Brunobeing a crazy sob nearly strangles another woman to death at a party. However in a social group where just days a ago a woman was strangled to death again nobody really seems to mind this coincidence and Bruno is not a suspect.Then Bruno pushes Guy to kill his father so Guy breaks into the house. But then as sort of the twist Guy is not there to actually kill him but just to talk to him. At this point it really stops to make any sense. Why would he break into his house in the middle of the night and sneak around just to tell him that instead of calling him first like a normal person? Why on earth would he bring a gun?!But... the father is not there and instead its one of Brunos traps. So what is Guys first reaction? He puts the gun right next to the crazy person and actually tells him that he is crazy and will probably go to jail. Luckily Bruno is very concerned about mother so Guy doesn't get shot.However the showdown really takes the cake! The trained police men decide to open fire on the merrygoroundyou know the fast moving thing with all the kids! on it and kill the operator. So naturally the merrygoround turns into a killer machine and the little kids ride starts operating at highway speeds. Next a crazy old dude crawls under the merrygoround as the only hope of stopping this monster machine because there simply seems to be no other way to turn it off. By this point we are already in far too deep and returning to sanity would be a little confusing. So the next logical step is ... of course... an exploding merrygoround!! The villain dies tragically and Guy is again the good straightup guy. Not exactly much of an ending.Overall a good film with a lot of very big flaws. I was a little disappointed at times.".

Robert Walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase really convincing  giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times.  His costar in here Farley Granger is okay but is no match for  Walker either in acting or in the characters they play.   It's the typical Hitchcock film with some strange camera angles  immoral themes innocent man gets in trouble etc. Unlike a lot of his  other films I thought this one was a fastmoving story with a very few  dull spots. Being an extennis player I enjoyed his footage of some  excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies.  Hitchcock's reallife daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique  minor character role in here. She didn't just get the job because of  her dad she can act. Also of note the DVD has both the British and  American versions and there were some differences in the story. This is  a classic film that is still referred to in modernday films even  comedies such as Throw Momma Off The Train.".

Also of note the DVD has both the British and  American versions and there were some differences in the story. This is  a classic film that is still referred to in modernday films even  comedies such as Throw Momma Off The Train.";

He was finally offered a sevenyear directing contract by producer David O. Selznick. His first project was supposed to be a film about the Titanic but Selznick scrapped the project because he couldn't find a boat to sink. Selznick assigned Hitch to direct Rebeca 1940 instead which later won the Best Picture Oscar . Later on  Hitchcock shot Strangers on a train.Tensesuspensemystery abounds in this thriller from Hithcock who combines the elements of intrigue with romance drama and action . Thrilling and interesting screenplay based on a Patricia Highsmith novel and coscripted by novelist Raymond Chandler and uncredited the prestigious Ben Hecht .

In a lot of his films more noticeably in the early black and white American films he used to create more shadows on the walls to create suspense and tension . Hitch hated to shoot on location  he preferred to shoot at the studio where he could have full control of lighting and other factors. Rating  Above average  well worth watching . This good thriller by the master himself who preys on the senses and keeps the suspense at feverish pitch . Worthwhile seeing thanks some Hitch's touches .".

	schema:headline " Hitchcock's compelling and original suspense masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry. It is likely a sign of how ahead of his time Hitchcock was always attempting to push the envelope and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining but always with a deeper more poignant motive on his mind. Strangers on a Train one of Hitchcock's first and more underrated hits is a perfect example of these traits  an entertaining and suspenseful story even when viewed over 50 years later yes but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique. Arguably one of the pioneering suspense thrillers Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 if perhaps slightly less shocking. The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick careful editing are what really make the film stand out drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audience's focus even in slower scenes. If there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion. Sadly enough there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing  Bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film's most tense and engaging scene. These are only brief moments but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film.But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise. As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid cliche after cliche it's wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original. Sure it's fairly straightforward but the concept of swapping murders is simply one that would not fly in films of today's day and age which makes it all the more entertaining to watch the film's brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while. One can't help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well especially the concept of darkness in humanity's heart demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder as well as Bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour Bruno popping a child's balloon with his cigarette is priceless and irony shooting suspenseful scenes in happy easygoing environments such as the iconic carnival scenes to create an even more eerie atmosphere. This may be a suspense thriller yes but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable. The antagonistic figure of Bruno essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker sadly in his last film role but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable as the character is a marvel to behold. Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems. Rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment Bruno is a calm controlled psychotic mess. He speaks of murder in such an offhand tone yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people. Bruno could seem to represent the Id as Freud would put it the inner darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind. It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure Guy Haines and how bland and uninteresting he seems almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing. Yet despite this implied message Hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome. It's a testament to actor Farley Granger's talent that despite Robert Walker's villain easily stealing the show Granger's hero still comes across as sympathetic still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character. Superb support is given by Ruth Roman who manages to overcome the cliche and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guy's horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife and Patricia Hitchcock proving that she is far more talented than being simply the director's daughter would imply. The superb cast headed by a simply wonderful Walker really bring the film to life adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcock's breathtaking stylistics. All in all Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers but it's still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems considering it was released half a century ago. Once again Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique and the film's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience! 910".

Granger is dating a politician's daughter with hope of becoming a politician himself and is divorcing his prettier but unfaithful wife who got herself pregnant by another man. Walker proposes the possibility of killing the unfaithful wife which Granger shrugs off as crazy talk.Later Granger tries to get his wife to sign some papers but she reveals her evil plan to make it look like HE was cheating on HER and will try to pass off her illegitimate child as Granger's odds are the other man left her. Granger is NOT happy. Later the wife goes running around having a good time at a carnival with two younger men and she is stalked by Walker. After a lot of build up black humor and creepy imagery Walker sneaks up on the wife and strangles her to death.Walker then goes to Granger and tells him he killed his wife. Granger wasn't exactly fond of his wife but he's appalled to learn that she's been murdered and that Walker ow expects Granger to murder his father who suspects Walker of his devious doings whereas his unsuspecting mother does not in return for the favor. Thus begins a battle of wills wherein Walker torments Granger his girlfriend and the others in his life while concealing that he has Granger's cigarette lighter which could incriminate Granger in his wife's murder if he places it back at the murder scene.Like many of Hitchcock's films this features the usual assortment of distorted relationships between men and their mothers badly portrayed authority figures creepy imagery black humor flawed but essentially innocent men and lots of observations about the darker side of human nature. An interesting film but there are some lulls. Not that Hitchcock was perfect but this one has more lulls than some of his other films which when combined with the lack of star powerbig name actors that this film had starring in it may attribute to why it is largely forgotten in light of films like Rear Window To Catch A Thief North By Northwest Notorious The Man Who Knew Too Much Vertigo Psycho and what not.Still Walker is memorable as the film's killer with his fey voice and intense gaze. At the time he actually had the potential for a big career he turned in some other less threatening performances in other films but alas fate was not on his side. One memorable image includes the murder being reflected in the wife's glasses. The climax on the merry go round is overkill though.One of my favorite quotes from the film comes between the girlfriend's sister and their father. Upon hearing of the wife's murder the sister played by Hitchcock's real life daughter calls the wife a tramp which may have been true and the father reprimands her with She was a human being. Even the lowest of us are entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The daughter retorts She pursued it in five different directions.".

After managing lunch with him Walker strikes up a conversation about criss cross murders two men kill people who are enemies of the other man. Granger is dating a politician's daughter with hope of becoming a politician himself and is divorcing his prettier but unfaithful wife who got herself pregnant by another man. Walker proposes the possibility of killing the unfaithful wife which Granger shrugs off as crazy talk.Later Granger tries to get his wife to sign some papers but she reveals her evil plan to make it look like HE was cheating on HER and will try to pass off her illegitimate child as Granger's odds are the other man left her. Granger is NOT happy. Later the wife goes running around having a good time at a carnival with two younger men and she is stalked by Walker.

	schema:reviewBody "A wonderful rich and entertaining film. It manages to be just about all things to all men a noirish thriller but with plenty of humour a matine feature with iconic set pieces the tennis match and the final fairground showdown and a handsome cast led by an unspeakably beautiful Ruth Roman. The acting is good and to some depth. Robert Walker's schemer Bruno Anthony sets the standard the others follow. Farley's tennis chump sic Guy Haines a character he's recycled from the earlier Rope is likable but bubbleheaded enough to maintain the suspense I also liked Patricia Hitchcock's Bobbie soxer sister to Roman a good foil for Farley's character and reminiscent of Barbara Bel Geddes' homely Midge opposite James Stewart's Scottie in Vertigo.What I hadn't expected is the homoerotic character not only explicit in Walker's Bruno but also throughout the action as a strong concurrent subtext. Once I had the idea in my head that Hitchcock intended the film as a homosexual tragedy I found it difficult to shift. Of course it's no more than subtext albeit a pervasive one it's 1951 after all but the psychosis of the queer character moves fluidly between the surface action and the implication of his relationship with Haines. It also serves as a way of explaining Haines' perplexing procrastination in involving the authorities  perhaps Bruno's behaviour is that of the sexual blackmailer. As I say such readings breed themselves. Anyway any sympathy that Hitchcock might have been seen to be harbouring towards the orientation of Bruno if not the character himself gets tied up neatly at the end with Haines decisively removed from the 'danger' and getting the girl.Hitchcock seems imperiously in control of his ideas and technique in this film. I was particularly taken with a sequence at a party. He successfully shows five different welldeveloped characters all benighted to different degrees and coming to their own conclusions without any need for dialogue both racking up tension and pushing the drama forward. There's very little to take issue with here. 810".

Farley tells him about his chronics and casually stranger offers a very compelling proposal that I kill yours and you kill mine. And that the point where Hitchcock captivates his audience.

Though Granger is repulsed by the idea one of the beautiful things about this film is that you can see in the performance he gives that Granger just might submit to temptation.In fact when Walker kills Laura Elliot Granger's wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man he expects that Granger will in turn murder Walker's father so that Walker can inherit his estate. Today Walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that.Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career role ironically in his last complete film. Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished. Hitchcock does not do too bad by Farley Granger either. Of course when Granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him the tension. Strangers On A Train is also characterized by great editing first in the tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and waylay Walker before he plants evidence convicting Granger at the crime scene. And also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger.Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at his best it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing.".

	schema:reviewBody "In short here is how I feel about watching this movie due to it's tempting synopsis I was conned and I wish I had seen the negative reviews on this movie before I actually watched it.The setup of the movie was perfect exactly what I was anticipating two people on a train who are completely random strangers are talking one of them being a society's typical norm of a menace Bruno approaches the society's typical norm of a law abiding citizen Guy sort of speak. The menace goes on to tell the guy that he would kill the other guy's wife in exchange of the other guy killing his father. And the story goes on based on that idea.Guy's wife was being accompanied by two men in an amusement park they then lose her in a dark place for  at most  two minutes in which Bruno kills her by strangling her. Thing is the two guys have noticed Bruno following them a few times yet after knowing she was murdered they had given no statements of Bruno whatsoever? This point was not even reviewed in this so called mystery genre movie these two guy's statements literally never existed in the movie just completely ignored by the plot writer. And this is what I hate about this movie OH DID YOU THINK THIS WOULD WORK? HAHA NO BECAUSE IM GOING TO NOT MAKE IT WORK. I think that 's exactly what was in the mind of the plot writer as he went through with it he kept making so much points and then invalidating them that the movie was a practical bore and annoying how can you enjoy a movie when every important point becomes suddenly disdained because of a coincidencial event? Too much coincidences occur that at one point of the movie I thought I fking hate this movie and I went for a smoke here is a list off the top of my head of points that were made then disdained because the writer simply wanted to1. The murder Two guys were watching Bruno follow Guy's wife in the park yet somehow did not give their statements this was previously explained hence I won't go into details.2. The alibi Guy's alibi was that he was speaking to a professor at a train during the time of the murder. He was able to recall the name of the professor and the professor was actually called to the station yet somehow had forgotten the man that he had JUST MET yesterday. Also the fuss over him not having a proper alibi was because He might have seen the man and then caught a later train hence having enough time to murder his wife.. Question is how did he know the man's name through his face? Does the tennis player know a list of professors who live in different citiestowns?3. The lighter Goodness gracious! Really? This? First let me explain why this was so important Bruno says he would take the lighter to the police station and say that this lighter he was asked by Guy to pick up from the murder scene so that his name would be clear which would work because Guy has been seen talking to Bruno after the murder. However a simple This guy is a menace he said he would kill my wife in exchange of me killing his father. He read about me in magazines and actually killed my wife and is now pushing me to kill his father. I did give him the lighter in the train. I can even prove that he's the killer I'm sure someone must've seen him in the amusement park.. I mean anyone with one digit IQ would have been able to say that right? Now the heartbreaker the whole movie revolves around this. I had to watch around 100 minutes with this point being the main point in the plot it is incredibly annoying and sad to watch such a weak motive become the main point.4. The mother of all clichs the tennis match and the lighter falling in the sewers Guy's plan was to finish the tennis match by winning 3 sets in a row to get to the park just in time to meet Bruno there and confront him then take his lighter from him. Seriously this was the mastermind Guy's plan to overtake Bruno. Guy loses his third set and starts losing time BUT WAIT Bruno somehow drops the lighter into the sewers and attempts to grab hold of it subcliche 1. Guy keeps losing and time keeps passing BUT WAIT Bruno pushes the lighter deeper unintentionally subcliche 2. Guy then wins the match and Bruno retrieves the lighter.5. The final fight in the amusement park Many many things are wrong here. Police shooting in a carousel with children in it and killing an innocent man? Bruno trying to kill Guy yet after when the fight is over they do not even try to guess why they literally don't even ask Why were you fighting him? or Who is he?. Or when the lighter drops from Bruno's hand and then suddenly everyone believes Guy their opinion changes so fast I could swear the only reason why that happened was because they didn't have enough tape to shoot.And another very important thing that I hate most How on earth does someone who wishes murder for someone else get the happy ending like Guy was for his wife's murder? And if anyone would think he wasn't happy for her death I'd ask you this What was Guy's reaction to know his wife was killed?It's a waste of time people. Unless if you're willing to know how a plot shouldn't be made.".

Guy keeps losing and time keeps passing BUT WAIT Bruno pushes the lighter deeper unintentionally subcliche 2. Guy then wins the match and Bruno retrieves the lighter.5. The final fight in the amusement park Many many things are wrong here. Police shooting in a carousel with children in it and killing an innocent man? Bruno trying to kill Guy yet after when the fight is over they do not even try to guess why they literally don't even ask Why were you fighting him? or Who is he?. Or when the lighter drops from Bruno's hand and then suddenly everyone believes Guy their opinion changes so fast I could swear the only reason why that happened was because they didn't have enough tape to shoot.And another very important thing that I hate most How on earth does someone who wishes murder for someone else get the happy ending like Guy was for his wife's murder? And if anyone would think he wasn't happy for her death I'd ask you this What was Guy's reaction to know his wife was killed?It's a waste of time people. Unless if you're willing to know how a plot shouldn't be made.";

Then I saw Strangers On A Train and his performance in that film changed my mind and how!! His dark perverse character is the epitome of evil with a smiling face. He oozes through this film like a bad dream and is your worst nightmare. The story from the book by Patricia Highsmith is well adapted from the original and may even be better. I read the book after seeing the movie and I was biased by the images from the film that kept popping before my eyes. Farley Granger who never was one of my favorites is all wrong for the part of Guy Haines. Hitchcock insisted on using him see Rope....he obviously saw something in him. His personality is so unattractive that it makes you wonder how Ruth Roman could ever be in love with him. He is the perfect victim for Walker and is a weakling who won't even go to the police when the murder swapping scenario begins. Some of the images in this film are quite striking.....the reflection in the victim's glasses the tennis match where everyone is watching the ball except Walker and the fingers groping in the drain for the lighter. Pure Hitchcock. Poor Robert Walker never got the chance to follow up this wonderful performance due to his untimely death and the promise he showed here as a villain may have taken him to greater characterizations. This may not be one of Hitchcock's best films but it certainly should be on everyone's list as a mustsee.".

It is a black and white classic chock full of vintage cars clothing mixed drinks and scenes so calculated you can hear the clockwork go tick tock tick tock. Its implausible premise an obnoxious heir Bruno Antony Robert Walker meets Guy Haines Farley Granger a tennis pro on a train and without so much as a howdoyoudo tells Guy that he wants Guy to murder his Bruno's father. In exchange Bruno will murder Guy's wife so that Guy can marry his hot girlfriend the senator's daughter Anne Morton Ruth Roman. Guy's personal life is known to Bruno because Guy is a sports celebrity.In real life of course anyone with a three digit IQ would simply say to Bruno the madman Excuse me stand up and walk away. Guy does not and the movie never offers any interesting reason why Guy loyally sticks by Bruno as if they were old army buddies and Bruno had once saved Guy's life. This total lack of any plausibility makes the movie boring for the viewer seeking insight into human behavior.Hitchcock's films are always implausible. No one believes that Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint could really walk across the faces on Mount Rushmore as they did in North by Northwest. As Hitchcock liked to point out North by Northwest isn't even a real compass point. The whole point of that movie was not to tell a real story but to put a very handsome and charismatic star Cary Grant in tensioninducing settings none of which you can ever really believe but all of which you can enjoy.With Strangers on a Train though Hitchcock's signature implausibility and style are there but there's nothing enjoyable to watch on screen  unless  and it is a big unless  you are a misanthrope and a misogynist who harbors murderous tendencies and finds people too stupid to be endured. If you can identify with Bruno and if you like to fantasize about killing people and if you think that other people are so stupid that they deserve to be murdered by you and that they aren't smart enough to realize what you are up to I think this might be your favorite movie. Guy's complete idiocy would strike you as convincing. That Bruno can all but strangle to death an idiotically smiling and nodding society matron at a blacktie party just a short while after he strangled Guy's wife in an amusement park a murder that has not yet been solved and that no police would arrest or even interrogate Bruno after he strangled this matron in full view of the important people in town would strike you as completely believable.The fun for Strangers on a Train's fans is watching Bad Boy Bruno do bad things and in watching the rest of the population let Bruno get away with doing bad things because they are too stupid or too passive or too lazy or too bewitched to intervene. You have to have a very dim view of humanity to find that convincing or even a good time.An unexpected pleasure in the film Ruth Roman. Ruth Roman's celebrity has not outlasted her career even fans of Golden Age movies are unlikely to worship at her shrine selecting more obvious goddesses like Bette Joan Katharine Greta or Marilyn. Roman starred mostly in B pictures and no one movie is all hers. She is very beautiful and also quite fascinating here though as if visiting from a far better movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "As in the case of many of Alfred Hitchcock's best films this is a story about an innocent socially respectable individual who suddenly discovers himself as an unwilling victim of malevolence and depravity. Bruno Antony Robert Walker stalks tennis pro Guy Haines Farley Granger and utilizes Haines' miserable highly publicized marriage in order to implicate him in a twisted double murder plot to which Haines never consents. The success of this movie hinges upon three key elements 1 the riveting portrayal of Walker as a demented psychopath in the best performance of his all too short acting career 2 the extraordinary artistry of my very favorite director Alfred Hitchcock and 3 the outstanding technical skills of cinematographer Robert Burks.Observe at the beginning of the film how Bruno's shadow eclipses that of Miriam and her friends in the boats as a very dark forewarning of what is to follow. In general the merrymaking of the revelers at the carnival serves as a stark contrast against the dead seriousness of Bruno's purpose at the scene. In fact he is even dressed in a formal business suit which is an oddity in that setting by itself.No matter how many times the famous shot of the reflection in the eyeglasses is explained to me I will never understand how that was photographed so effectively. The sensational carousel scene in which Guy is literally ensnared into Bruno's trap must be seen to be believed. No description in words can give it justice. This is Hitchcock's craft at his very best.Among the weaknesses of the film is Dmitri Tiomkin's often overbearing musical score which awkwardly occurred in another Hitchcock classic Dial M for Murder about a very different tennis player. The tennis match also ran far too long and was all too reminiscent of the prolonged symphony near the end of the remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much 1956. Even Sir Alfred isn't always perfect.These momentary flaws are more than compensated by the movie's many dramatic and cinematic strengths. The image of Bruno sitting in the stands of the tennis match with his head fixed dead ahead while all of the spectators around him are following the ball demonstrates just how seriously discordant he is with the rest of the world. I also noted how Hitchcock made Miriam Guy's loathsome unfaithful wife so disagreeable to me that I found myself actually approving of her violent strangulation. In this regard was I any less sinister than Bruno in my consent of the murder of another human being no matter how objectionable that human being might be? Once again as a passive spectator I felt very successfully tricked by the master of manipulators. It wasn't the first time and it surely won't be the last.".

Part of the problem occurs when the liveaction segments are shot too closely to the target. There is a sequence in a car and it took me ten seconds at least to get adjusted to the 3D. These are not problems that occurred in vista shots.The CG work was fantastic and the 3D involving it was equally as impressive. I saw Meet the Robinsons in 3D this spring and am eagerly awaiting whatever other 3D offers there are in store like Beowolf and Avatar.I hate to keep ragging on the liveaction elements but the acting was wretched too. Apparently it is difficult finding somebody who will have all of 30 seconds of screen time and maybe 20 words of dialogue to not sound like they're reading off of a teleprompter. It is nice to see and having a 5year it is nice to be able to show and explain to him how we can and do know these things about creatures that died out millions of years ago but with such wooden acting it makes me just sit and wait until the CG behemoths come tearing across the screen again.".

It is nice to see and having a 5year it is nice to be able to show and explain to him how we can and do know these things about creatures that died out millions of years ago but with such wooden acting it makes me just sit and wait until the CG behemoths come tearing across the screen again.";

The word Monster in the title is a bit deceiving as most of the creatures are the sea form of dinosaurs. The 3 D experience is absolutely outstanding. I found that sitting toward the front of the theater produced the best 3 D experience. This movie may be a little intense for small children but all other ages will love it. The one positive thing for children is the forty minute run times that seems to fly by. National Geographic should have a hit on their hands as more and more people travel back in time to check out the Sea Monsters.".

It's like mediocre daytime drama taking place in the ancient ages with the constant kill or be killed. No real informative aspects on the creatures depicted in here. The animation is probably the best aspect from this film but even this one is not particularly great. And the staged sections with the archaeologists in the 1970s are just pretty cringeworthy to watch to be honest.

It's clear that England is in a pretty gloomy state and ruled by a humourless zealot Mary the ubiquitous Kathy Burke who is hellbent on converting or murdering Elizabeth My sister was born a whore of that Ann Boleyn.Cheery Mary rules a poor remote island that is very likely to become the next possession of the growing empire of Spain. She is surrounded by rebels who want to place the Protestant Elizabeth on the throne. So Mary gets her trusted Lord Norfolk Eccleston cuts an impressive presence you can imagine this man swishing on the battlefield to arrest Lizzy and dispatch her to the Tower of London.The camerawork and the pace of this film are breathtaking.

Two scenes in particular reek of the Mafia masterpiece one in the Vatican the other a succession of assassinations sparked by the majesty's demand let it all be done. Pure Pacino.If you shimmy past the slightly silly inclusions of the likes of Eric Cantona the IKEA School of Acting and Angus Deayton and the fact that Dickie Attenborough plays a fussy sidekick who sniffs the Queen's bedsheets and claims her body belongs to the State is starting to resemble an Ewok the acting is otherwise splendid.Cate Blanchett not only resembles the great lady but imparts her with enormous affection her love of Lord Dudley played by Fiennes is tenderly dealt with and delivers her lines with a steely intelligence I do not see why a woman must marry at all and I'm no man's Elizabeth . Her performance is a revelation and if it weren't for Geoffrey Rush she would have stolen every scene. However the Shine star playing her demonic sidekick Walsingham delights in creeping in the shadows and pulling the devilish strings. A positively Machiavellian turn and worthy of another Oscar.This is a history film made at its very finest and the equal of A Man For All Seasons. Elizabeth could have unfolded in front of me all day and I would have remained enraptured. Intoxicating imagery English blood on French colours the wicked Mary of Guise Ardant proclaims naughty shenanigans dastardly deeds an epic tale and a superb cast. Stunning cinema.".

A positively Machiavellian turn and worthy of another Oscar.This is a history film made at its very finest and the equal of A Man For All Seasons. Elizabeth could have unfolded in front of me all day and I would have remained enraptured. Intoxicating imagery English blood on French colours the wicked Mary of Guise Ardant proclaims naughty shenanigans dastardly deeds an epic tale and a superb cast. Stunning cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say first that while I loved this movie for Cate Blanchett's great actingfor the visuals and even the soundtrack I can't help but wonder how filmmakers can so blatantly reinvent history! I saw this movie in the theaterand had to literally bite my tongue all through it not to shout out loud at the totally fictive events strangely telescoped time line and juggling of names and characters.It's not like Elizabeth I is some obscure figure in English or world history. You would think SOMEONE involved in the production of this movie might have bothered to look something anything!!up!I can only conclude that the makers of this film had NO intention of portraying Elizabeth's personality intelligence forcefulness and political acumen accurately let alone the events of her life and reign.The portrayal of her as faltering and weak in the beginning is hard to swallow as she was politically subtle and well versed in the arts of intrigue from the cradle.Although so many socalled historical films are not accurate or portray history through a particular bias this one must be called total fiction. It's much quicker to name the parts that ARE correct. Let's see there was this Queen of England named Elizabethand..well that's pretty much it!They did sprinkle a lot of her famous quotes throughout though at completely the wrong times and in the wrong situations. Alas!And did anyone realize that the filmmakers had the wrong Duc D'Anjou? The Duc who liked to crossdress was the older brother of the Duc who was proposed as her suitor. He had previously held that title but was King of France at the time of his younger brother's and present Duc D'Anjou's suit for Elizabeth.Close but no cigar.I found especially ridiculous the implication at the end of the story that she was through with Robert Dudley after his fictionalbetrayal of her. Any biography of Elizabeth is replete with references to the huge part he played in her life both politically and personally.I needn't go on I can't go on! The inaccuracies are legion and have been mentioned in other reviews. If you don't give a tinker's damn about even approaching anything like historical accuracy this is the movie for you. Otherwise see Elizabeth R or better yetread a book about her.".

	schema:headline " One of the finest historical dramas in years.";
	schema:reviewBody "As far as Academy Award recognition is concerned 'Elizabeth' was unfortunately released in the same year 1998 as the much slicker more crowdpleasing 'Shakespeare in Love' a fine comic film but as much overpraised as 'Elizabeth' was overlooked. It certainly borders on the absurd if not the criminal that Gwyneth Paltrow's simpering onenote performance as Viola was handed the Best Actress Award over Cate Blanchett's truly magnificent performance in the title role of 'Elizabeth' a film whose tracing of Elizabeth's transformation from teenage frolicker to commanding 'Virgin Queen' presented an enormous challenge of acting range that Blanchett met with aplomb. Curiously 'Shakespeare in Love' and 'Elizabeth' not only share the presence of Elizabeth I as an historical character albeit at opposite ends of her nearly 50 year reign but also two prominent cast members Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush. Although Fiennes' role as the Earl of Leicester Elizabeth's lover prior to her Virgin Queen persona days is smaller and far less winning than his lead role in 'Shakespeare in Love' he again cuts a convincing figure in 16th century costume. On the other hand Geoffrey Rush's performance as Sir Francis Walsingham Elizabeth's utterly ruthless yet completely loyal bodyguard and Machiavellian tutor is endlessly and hypnotically fascinating  a performance that steals movies in movies whose leads are less arresting than Ms. Blanchett. Yet in an ironic reversal of Hollywood's usual denigration of comedy in favor of 'serious' drama it was Rush's much smaller comic performance in 'Shakespeare' that secured him the 1998 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ordinarily I'd applaud such recognition of comic art and talent but in this instance it represents another miscarriage of justice. Rush's tone and bearing as he delivers line after line of bloodchilling dialog make Walsingham a character I expect never to forget. 'You were Norfolk' he responds to the protests of the insufferably arrogant Duke of Norfolk Elizabeth's chief nemesis as he leads him away to the Tower 'the dead have no titles.' Of course Elizabeth gets off many a great line of her own as in her unforgettable final rejection of Leicester 'I am not your Elizabeth. I am no man's Elizabeth. I shall have one mistress here. And no master!' A little later she gives license to Walsingham to proceed with the political cleansing of the realm with a laconic transcendence of her 'womanly' emotions 'let it all be done.' Still another memorable line marks the final stage of her political education and her departure from the wishywashy diplomacy represented by Lord Burleigh her former chief minister finely played by Sir Richard Attenborough in his final film role 'Observe Lord Burleigh I am married  to England.' Elizabeth ultimately forges a political philosophy that combines elements of Walsingham's cynical wariness with an ideal of selfabnegating service to England 'my people'. She envisions a strong secular England capable of rising above the internecine religious strife initiated by her father's departure from the Roman Catholic Church and depicted in graphic horror in the film's opening sequence. In so doing she succeeds in mapping out England's course toward a stable advanced society whose history would include a lengthy period of world domination. This film does full justice to the dilemmas of churchstate conflict to the complex character of the queen herself and to the rich historical milieu that produced her. It is one of the finest historical dramas to have appeared in decades.".

	schema:headline " A very good try";
	schema:reviewBody "As soccer legend Eric Cantona's former colleagues might say this is a film of two halves. Despite an intimidating opening scene the first half soon settles down to establishing who everyone is  the bad guys drip malevolence while the good guys dance in gay meadows. It is not until the second half that the politics and intrigue really get going.The film opens in England circa 1550s. The country is divided half of the population pledging allegiance to the childless catholic Queen Mary who is dying while the other half attempt to place their protestant liege Elizabeth on the throne.Mary dies before providing an heir so the monarchy automatically passes to Elizabeth. However she inherits a rebellious court keen to see her removed and a catholic monarch installed. Fortunately for Elizabeth there are not enough candidates for the job. While the evil Duke of Norfolk plots to put himself and Mary Queen of Scots on the English throne Elizabeth's supporters rush around trying to find her a suitable international king.The crux comes when she declares she is only interested in her English lover Lord Robert Dudley. When her enemies learn of this they try to drive a wedge between them. And from this premise the real intrigue flows.In terms of characterisation the film scores some hits and some misses. Some curious casting decisions undermine a few of the characters  working class mainstay Kathy Burke moves to the opposite end of the social spectrum to play Queen Mary Brit comic Angus Deayton has an unnecessary cameo while Eric Cantona seems an odd choice although his performance seems adequate.As to the main characters Elizabeth Cate Blanchett is well charted from gamboling youth to icehard queen. The black loyalty of Sir Francis Wolsingham Geoffrey Rush is tested time and again and never found wanting allowing him to grow from mistrusted bodyguard to Queen's adviser.Unfortunately the Queen's enemies are so numerous it is difficult to focus on one. Michael Hirst the writer chooses the Duke of Norfolk as the chief villain but we never really learn why  or what his plans beyond unseating Elizabeth are. Christopher Ecclestone plays the Duke with the right amount of menace but we are never truly intimidated by his smouldering glare. Lord Robert Joseph Fiennes is an equally confused character. Is he guilty of the crimes he is accused of? Does he love the queen? Some of his behaviour suggests he does not yet he constantly returns to her claiming he does. The uncertainty generated by Lord Robert is compounded by the fact that Joseph Fiennes does not belong in this film.Beyond the characters many of the films finest moments come in the form of the brightly coloured set pieces  when the court takes to the boat lake the arrival of the french prince and the coronation. Some of the blacker scenes also serve very well  the aftermath of the battle the plotting in the Vatican.Despite the fine art direction what we are eventually left with is a sumptuous well made film let down by a slow start and a few undefined characters.".

	onyx:emotionText "As soccer legend Eric Cantona's former colleagues might say this is a film of two halves. Despite an intimidating opening scene the first half soon settles down to establishing who everyone is  the bad guys drip malevolence while the good guys dance in gay meadows. It is not until the second half that the politics and intrigue really get going.The film opens in England circa 1550s. The country is divided half of the population pledging allegiance to the childless catholic Queen Mary who is dying while the other half attempt to place their protestant liege Elizabeth on the throne.Mary dies before providing an heir so the monarchy automatically passes to Elizabeth. However she inherits a rebellious court keen to see her removed and a catholic monarch installed. Fortunately for Elizabeth there are not enough candidates for the job. While the evil Duke of Norfolk plots to put himself and Mary Queen of Scots on the English throne Elizabeth's supporters rush around trying to find her a suitable international king.The crux comes when she declares she is only interested in her English lover Lord Robert Dudley. When her enemies learn of this they try to drive a wedge between them. And from this premise the real intrigue flows.In terms of characterisation the film scores some hits and some misses. Some curious casting decisions undermine a few of the characters  working class mainstay Kathy Burke moves to the opposite end of the social spectrum to play Queen Mary Brit comic Angus Deayton has an unnecessary cameo while Eric Cantona seems an odd choice although his performance seems adequate.As to the main characters Elizabeth Cate Blanchett is well charted from gamboling youth to icehard queen. The black loyalty of Sir Francis Wolsingham Geoffrey Rush is tested time and again and never found wanting allowing him to grow from mistrusted bodyguard to Queen's adviser.Unfortunately the Queen's enemies are so numerous it is difficult to focus on one. Michael Hirst the writer chooses the Duke of Norfolk as the chief villain but we never really learn why  or what his plans beyond unseating Elizabeth are. Christopher Ecclestone plays the Duke with the right amount of menace but we are never truly intimidated by his smouldering glare. Lord Robert Joseph Fiennes is an equally confused character. Is he guilty of the crimes he is accused of? Does he love the queen? Some of his behaviour suggests he does not yet he constantly returns to her claiming he does. The uncertainty generated by Lord Robert is compounded by the fact that Joseph Fiennes does not belong in this film.Beyond the characters many of the films finest moments come in the form of the brightly coloured set pieces  when the court takes to the boat lake the arrival of the french prince and the coronation. Some of the blacker scenes also serve very well  the aftermath of the battle the plotting in the Vatican.Despite the fine art direction what we are eventually left with is a sumptuous well made film let down by a slow start and a few undefined characters.";

One fact regarding Elizabeth and Dudley was glaring in its omission. If this movie renders anyone with a desire to read historical information on this much celebrated queen excellent. Hers is a story worth learning. I have read a few books on Her Majesty and much enjoyed Glenda Jackson's portrayal in the BBC mini series. That is why I checked this movie out certainly withholding any expectation of quality and accuracy as presented by the BBC. I am so glad I saw this fairy tale before I actually paid money for it. It was a pretty film but seeing how it was so far off the mark historically I can't even say that the acting was exceptional. Oscar worthy?

	schema:reviewBody "I was a big fan of the BBC series Elizabeth R starring Glenda Jackson so I was intrigued to see how this movie was going to portray Elizabeth's reign. What I found was a dark violent and ultimately inaccurate portrayal of one of my favorite periods of history.The movie covers Elizabeth's treatment under her halfsister Mary's reign her subsequent ascension to the throne upon Mary's death and the early years of her reign. Information about these people and events is readily available from a number of sources so one wonders how Michael Hirst managed to put together such an inaccurate portrait of this period. Mary Tudor was not the doddering old fool she is portrayed as here even though most of her actions as queen were misguided. Neither was Elizabeth as uneducated in the ways of court as she is presented to be. And while Dudley was certainly a favorite of Elizabeth's she never slept with him there is a reason she was called the Virgin Queen after all. Also she knew him well when they were in the tower together during Mary's reign. She knew he was married. It was what saved his life. Her discovery of this fact wouldn't have been a shocking betrayal because there was nothing to discover. Likewise he would never have plotted against her. He knew where his bread was buttered. Walsingham was a trusted adviser but not the only one Elizabeth could turn to nor was he the murderer he is made out to be in this film. And Cecil left her service for his own reasons not because she tired of him and banished him.Visually the film is quite dark. Many scenes take place at night or in secluded places shut away from the light. Even those in the daylight have a furtiveness about them that gives the whole film an element of paranoia which is quite distracting. While the violence is true to the times it is excessive and we could live without seeing the beheading.The cast does a good job with the material they are given. Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth is a bit naive but still charming. Joseph Fiennes' Dudley is charismatic. Geoffrey Rush's Walsingham is a cipher as though Rush were unsure whether to portray Walsingham as trustworthy or menacing and ended up doing neither very well. Christopher Eccleston's Norfolk bristles with evil and menace. Lewis Jones' murderous priest is so over the top that you can't wait for him to get his. Also over the top although far more entertaining is Vincent Cassel's Duc d'Anjou. Fanny Ardant strikes the right balance with her portrayal of Mary of Guise. Richard Attenborough's Cecil is quite noble.Clearly Hirst sacrificed accuracy for entertainment's sake. He did have some success in this as it is an entertaining film. But if you really want to learn about this period get the first two episodes of the BBC series Elizabeth R and watch those. They present a far more accurate picture of the beginning of the Elizabethan period.".

This often requires dangerous adventure on the part of the artists concerned most necessarily the director. Rarely does it occur in Britishmade historical costume drama. That's because they are constrained by a stuffy notion of the static observance of important events.' In such dramas the character displayed has to hold our interest all else particularly in costuming adds a reverent poise.This is better than that. Elizabeth is an important figure for sure certainly among the few most influential to my life. She broke the back of Catholic meddling in civil affairs establishing the first albeit fragile and oft submerged notions of statesponsored freedom of religion. She was the first postrenaissance monarch to elevate plebian arts as much responsible for Shakespeare as the writer himself. She was a master at coopting religious archetypes to manipulate the masses. All of this is the matter of this film. She also tacitly encouraged Thomas Harriot in inventing what we now know as algebraic logic but that's outside the scope of this film which deals with the simpler forces of war and brutish Papism.But that's not what entrances. Instead it is a combination of the director's commitment to highlight destiny as the focus and the art of Ms Cate in projecting infusing her personality into her surroundings.This director is unknown to me. He seems to be of that swelling class of competent selfaware directors without pretense. There's no dogma here only knowing craft especially in the eye of the camera. His DVD commentary is very good  listen to him share his notions of the eye even to the eyes on her bedroom lace the eye of the crossshaped windows the schizophrenic eye the scheming eye. He's not a master but he is better than what he attempts. Compare this to the stagestruck eye of MerchantIvory.But the key ingredient here is Cate Blanchett. This woman lives in her surroundings. She is as vulnerable to fate and as open to voyeuristic examination as Emily Watson but she is as commanding when needed of her environment as say Pacino to pick an extreme case and so flawed. Compare this to the imperious Dench and many others to see how important is that former quality. There must be an Australian acting coach that teaches this as others from Sydney show this awareness.The director sees this and has been adept at building wonderful surrounding characters.See how Rush lobbies for a closed soul. He is perhaps our most celebrated closed actor. Many others are closed like Freeman and Hackman but Rush has depth that they do not. He ultimately wins and we grieve a little. His surrogate is played by the quiet method actor Frain. See him in Titus.' where he shines because of this.See how the completely open actor Fiennes tries to lure her into simple emotional acting. He would succeed the next year with the malleable Paltrow  with Rush providing the same contrast. His surrogate in this film was the explosive intuitive French suitor.See how the ultraminimalist Norfolk threatens with his theatrical intensity the traditional theatrical style of acting opposing her filmic style. In fact much can be said of how film style undermines superficial religion which is why Pat Robertson invests billions in cooptation. His surrogate is played by the inestimable Geilgud in a minimal part.See how the master Cecil is played by the grand master of British film. Watch him try to guide her through destiny with a vision greater than the other characters but less than us as viewers we are given control over both the camera's eye of fate and the knowledge of how things turn out.' Lord Attenborough's presence catalyzes Cate's and he is outgrown. Cate's mirror is the famed Fanny Ardant who does not close off herself and so dies. Her acting style is also external intuitive flamboyant.Blanchett is a wonderful talent here with all the support she needs. How lucky for her  and for us.

Cecil was not the milksop portrayed in the movie.Third many of the cast looked like members of a 1990's Los Angeles street gang instead of characters from 16th century England.I believe the high overall ratings given the film are a result of ignorance of history.";

The basic intention of any movie is to tell a story and the story that is told in Elizabeth is not only inaccurate it is also dull and boring.  Historical accuracy means little to me when watching a film as long as it can be comprehended.  But this movie is not and too many times fails in telling the story of the Virgin Queen.  I felt like reaching into the screen and asking why certain scenes were portrayed in the fashion that they were the disconnected plot and movable characters defeat the purpose of telling a story about perhaps the most formidable monarch in English history.Cate Blanchett is an exceptional young actress who can be appreciated for her portrayal of Elizabeth a woman who was confronted with suitors and questions regarding her faith.  But in my opinion continuity in the film was completely missing and limited Cate's ability to bring her character to life.  The lack of intensity in the film is startling when considering the subject matter and how important it was at the time.  Many times it seemed as if the actors were begging to be allowed to act to their full capacity while the script dictated that they could not.With all the above said it remains a fact that all of the actors in the film are exceptional and make the best of what they are given. Geoffrey Rush steals the show as Walsingham who seeks to do all he can to protect his Queen.  Joseph Fiennes as Dudley shows a man who loves Elizabeth but cannot ever marry her.  As told in the movie we learn that Elizabeth never knew he was already married.  While in reality she did know this fact does not harm the intrigue the two of them have while Elizabeth tries to secure her throne while loving Dudley at the same time. Kathy Burke does a great job as Mary Tudor the miserable Queen who sought to convert her halfsister Elizabeth before she could ascend to the throne to replace her and her religion.  Richard Attenborough as Cecil is limited by the character he is given but stresses the reality of the time once you become King or Queen you are bound to your state.  In the end when Elizabeth declares herself the Virgin Queen and her service to England Cecil's once trivial line becomes reality.  The Duke of Norfolk's service to Mary Tudor and intrigues to overthrow Elizabeth are well portrayed by the commanding presence of Christopher Eccleston who in the end signs away his life trying to take Elizabeth's.After reading all of the praises I have for the acting in the movie we must return to the reality that the film could have been better if told by a different director and with a different script.  There is no denying the costume design setting and music are all well crafted and help to tell the intended story.  But too many times the audience is left to imagine what could have been and this is what I feel makes many label Elizabeth as a great movie.  Too much is forced into this telling of the legendary Queen of England and many people see it for what it could have been not what it is actors without direction or a wellcrafted story to tell.".

Director Kapur brings the air of corruption and betrayal to life in a story that is rich in detail and story.  The story is full of action and wonderful characters and holds the interest from beginning to end.  Kapur gives plenty of modern touches to the drama from comical touches of Elizabeth rehearsing her speech in very quickly edited sequences to filming her through a redveil shortly after a murder that was authorised by her.  It is good to watch a period drama that is so very vibrant and colourful.Cate Blanchett is great as Elisabeth but the supporting cast are roundly fantastic  Joseph Fiennes Geoffrey Rush Christopher Eccleston the list of quality actors goes on goes on.  This is also completed by UK TV actors such as Cathy Burke and Angus Deayton.

This sequence completes a dialectic which very much concerned  Elizabethan England in the film between the human body and the body politic Elizabeth is a symbol of.This is a historical epic you think Foucault might have approved of  indeed 'Surveiller et Punir' wouldn't be a bad subtitle.  There is a Foucauldian cynicism about the machinations of State here where religious ideals are only so much murderous politicking the scenes with the Pope and his envoy are frighteningly convincing where a church is seen as a perfect setting for regicide.  Kapur impresses on us the monumentality of the world against which Elizabeth struggles male power figured in forbidding stone buildings and huge shadowy chambers where human activity is obscured by the decor or veils framed by crucifix crosses that have nothing to do with religious trauma. The film opens with Catholics burning Protestant 'heretics' in front of a mob and ends with a 'Godfather'like massacring of Protestant Elizabeth's Catholic enemies whose threat is not religious but one of power. The most repeated visual motif in the film is an unmotivated long shot from deep above a building's rafters looking down on the dotted political players a terrifying reminder of surveillance and omnipotence an expression of power that doesn't depend on its human agents that will always be there to circumscribe human endeavour.  Is it the perenially observing Walsingham Elizabeth's darkly charismatic advisorcumsecretpolicehenchman given one of the great entrances in modern cinema?  Or is it the God so godlessly invoked by these monsters?Pedants have complained that 'Elizabeth' is historically inaccurate as if cinema was a medium for plodding out facts.  'Elizabeth' is not a recreation of Elizabethan England and its modes of cultural expression  the film would be more formalised ritualised set as a masque rather than just featuring some.  Kapur's modern techniques his psychologising his narrative pace his restless camera his often overegged visual effects all capture the instability of a period that tried to cover it up with pomp and ceremony. This does not mean that the historical colour  the music the pantomimes the boat rides the dances aren't in themselves delightful it's just that they're imbued with narrative and character value 19th and 20th century values rather than symbolic ones.  This can be seen in the anachronistic use of Elgar and Mozart towards the end the latter's Requiem especially as Elizabeth becomes the Virgin Queen in effect killing herself as a woman. In the most bizarrely eclectic cast ever assembled in movies mixing comedians footballers TV quizshow hosts with 'proper' actors  Vincent Cassel is hilarious and Geoffrey Rush is outstanding proving after the falsestart of 'Shine' that he is truly one of the most remarkable figures in film.".

Better known to buffs of the odd the obscure and the strange as Daughter of Horror in the tale as told we are witness to the unraveling of a mind. Like Eraserhead the best of this subgenre it is difficult to tell where the madness starts and where reality ends or indeed if any of what we see on screen is real at all. It is hard to get any sense of what is occurring from the Gamine's point of view. Are the events happening to her? Is she dreaming? Hallucinating? The viewer or at least this viewer is always a little off balance while watching this movie and I think that that is what the director was aiming at.I would go so far as to say that within the budgetary constraints imposed this movie is a masterpiece. As stated in the synopsis this is a dark movie with no sympathetic characters no attractive locales no hope. Were it just a Film Noire murder story it would still be a very good movie. As a descent into madness it excels.".

The jazzy score and accompanying vocal renderings accent the weird mood perfectly.

Since the re release was shown  the film itself has pretty much disappeared and only terrible prints on the 1957 version have been available  giving a brief glimpse of what this film could have been. But now the full version has been released by Kino Films on DVD. The print is stunning compared to the previously available anything would be preferable and the restoration of the nightmarish jazzey score is fault less. Dementia and Daughter of Horror it was given a more salatious title to get audiences in are both on the disc...with some great extras its worth a look. The story itself is a livingdreaming nightmare  the boundaries are jarred from the first scene as we pan in from the empty street into the apartment window and track up to the bed. The Gammin wakes and looks as if she has just had a bad nightmare  she gets up and walks over to a drawer  opens it and pulls out a switchblade  she looks down and sneers  pockets the knife and goes out into the night. From here on we either know that she it totally insane or that she is out to protect herself or both. We follow her journey into bars and meetings with pimps and flower sellers. I wont tell you anymore about it  otherwise it will spoil the fun of finding out for yourself but this film is a must and belongs on any serious collectors shelf.".

Some of the nighttime black and white photography of the Gamine being pursued through city streets is right up there with THE THIRD MAN and many of the images especially the hacking off of a dead man's hand are shockingly indelible.

Finally at the library of arts at Lincoln Center in New York I found the history including the alternate title Daughter of Horror.  I finally got a copy of the film about 6 years ago. Still one of my favorites. Particularly because of the music and the fabulous singing of Marnie Nixon voice of Maria in West Side Story and other films.  A brilliant film by John Parker  who may actually be Bruno Vesota. Unknown piece of information. He of course is famous for such classics as The Brain Eaters and Attack of the Giant Leeches.

	schema:reviewBody "Nearly everyone has seen the classic low budget Fifties science fiction movie The Blob with Steve McQueen. The hero's pals go cruising on a weekend night and head to the local theatre to see if they can pick up girls at the midnight spooky show. Not many viewers know the name or content of the scary picture the movie audience is watching except that the title Daughter of Horror appears on the theatre marquee. This odd little independent chiller has been rediscovered in recent years by movie cultists and Fifties horror movie fans. It exists in two versions the Daughter of Horror version is better known in its 1957 rerelease with the narration by Ed McMahon added to the original silent 1953 version known as Dementia. The original is more impressive but the narrated version is still okay if you can't find the original. I won't say much about the plot because you should see it without preformed ideas if possible. The plot almost defies analysis anyway. SPOILERS AHEAD the movie is a slow dreamlike depiction of a solitary morose woman living alone in a cheap hotel in a rundown part of a large city. She seems to wake from a nightmare and proceeds to light a cigarette. She takes a large switchblade knife out of a bureau drawer and tests itsnapping it open with an air of familiarity. Her hair is short and she wears a mannish suit. It is implied that she is a lesbian. She leaves the building and goes out into the night to encounter a weird series of adventures. She is menaced by drunks and ambiguous characters whose true identity is hard to be sure of. Since there is no dialogue the viewer has to interpret the visuals according to their own ideas. At one point she reads a newspaper headline about a recent stabbing death and a creepy smile crosses her face. Has she committed a murder? She apparently is mistaken for a prostitute by a sleazy pimplike character and a rich man but seemingly agrees to their proposition though not actually a hooker in reality. You can't be sure about anything in this movie including whether she is a victim or a dangerous mentally disturbed person who kills casually for fun.The movie veers from bizarrely humorous moments to a creeping atmosphere of enveloping dread and hopelessness that is more intense than any film noir you've ever seen. The movie ends where it began and one is unsure just how much of what we've seen was real or a nightmare. The performance by nonprofessional actress Adrienne Barrett is amazing she was supposed to have been John Parker's secretary and told him of a dream she had had which then became the basis for the screenplay.The whole movie isn't much more than an hour and has a sort of Twilight Zone crossed with film noir feeling about it. It raises questions without giving clear answers about family violence domestic abuse women as pawns and playthings for men alienation and isolation loneliness and despair. It inspires a feeling of pity for the tormented heroine while keeping us aware of her capacity for violence and coldblooded murder. The eerie vocal effects of Marni Nixon add immeasurably to the unnerving atmosphere along with the drab nighttime scenes most of which were filmed on nearly deserted streets in rundown parts of Los Angeles. This film is a must see for anyone intrigued by psychological horror and independent productions.It is haunting unique and unforgettable.".

I have never been so assaulted emotionally psychologically and intellectually by a movie.  If you are looking for a fun and scary horror moviethis is NOT what you are looking for.  This film is very disturbing.  It is not gory or overly graphic just disturbing.  The aesthetics of the film stretch back to early German Expressionism to 70s psychedelia.  It is a bizarre mix of many things most of which work perfectly.  As you watch it it's very easy to start judging the movie and go Oh God it's doing this or that.  There are definately times when the movie borders on badness.  But it is always one step ahead of itself and one step ahead of you and one step ahead of any other movie I have ever seen.  The things the director does are amazinghe does things that were so ahead of his time.The portrait of the main character is amazing.  I've never felt so close to a character who completely freaked me out as I did to her.  She is SCARYand so human in a wierd way.  And that's why this movie was so good. It is not a black and white horror movie.  It's not a slasher flick.  It is definately trying to tell you something.  Whether the final message is feminist or sexist is up for debate.  This film is so well done that it's hard to tell whether it's being purposeful or exploitative.  It's pointless to write more.  You just have to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dementia is one weird film! To sum it up in a nutshell I'd say it's kind of like a longer and somewhat more macabre version of The Twilight Zone! The film doesn't include any graphic scenes  although this didn't stop Dementia being banned upon its release in 1955. The film creates it's horror through atmosphere rather than violence and the result is rather effective. It has to be said that the narration courtesy of Ed McMahon is more than a little bit cheesy  some have even compared the film to the 'works' of Ed Wood in that respect I personally wouldn't go that far  but his voiceover does have a horrific vibe to it and it certainly benefits the film. Dementia is not exactly plot heavy and we simply focus on a woman whom we are told is insane. We then follow this woman throughout the night as she gets involved in a series of activities  things such as encounters with various unsavoury characters and other happenings on the dark streets.The film contains no dialogue and the only speaking part belongs to the narrator. This sets the film apart on it's own as very few films work in this way and that only adds to its originality. The film achieves it's genuinely unsettling atmosphere via the way that every single character in the film is completely loathsome. It's not hard to see why this film offended the censors back in 1995. There are a few macabre scenes though most of the violence is implied rather than shown and this serves Dementia rather well. The film is very surreal and a lot of it feels like a nightmare  which is definitely to the film's credit. Watching the central character drift through John Parker's nightmarish dreamscape is entirely captivating and this is of huge benefit to the film as it completely relies on this in order to succeed. Dementia is unlikely to appeal to everyone due to its frankly odd nature but it's definitely a film worth seeing. Atmosphere is important in horror films and this one is PURE atmosphere  highly recommended viewing!".

It used to be called DEMENTIA and was made by a guy named John Parker at approximately the same time as Ed Wood made GLEN OR GLENDA  they even employed the same cinematographer.In fact the two films have a lot in common being both very personal cinematic statements and also sharing the kind of ineptitude that some critics favor. Of course Ed Wood is basically just a sweet transvestite from Transylvania.The idea of casting Lugosi as the genetic puppetmaster is really a stroke of genius. It is also absolutely hilarious.The sight of this once great or at least adequate actor having no idea what he's saying with his usual thick accent is nothing less than a revelation  what a wonderfully absurd way of expressing your doubts and fears and what a catharsis it must have been for the director leading up to the supreme moment when as a token of love and understanding his partner hands him the comparatively innocent article of clothing symbolizing the more discreet pleasures of the Lumberjack Song! So what if the audience has no idea what's going on? DEMENTIA is altogether less endearing. The director's heart may or may not bleed for his psychopathic lesbian gamine  another euphemism but the film basically comes across as a homophobic treatise.Or is the director a homosexual himself torn between his sympathy for the plight of the protagonist and his disgust with her whole sex? We shall never know but it's fun to guess.Which I might add does not mean condemnation since any sexual deviation is a testimony to the wonderful diversity of human nature  unless you're a Fascist. In fact condemnation seems to be what's wrong with this young woman rather than her occupation she's a prostitute or sexual orientation as we are invited to share her disgust in a series of cuts between the rich man who  although inexcusably fat and perspiring  looks as if he's enjoying his dinner and the face of our heroine which is a mask of hate.Also the fact that her pimp is being characterized in the credits as the evil one may lead you to suspect that the filmmaker is not a complete stranger to the idea that the problems of modern society is best solved by Charles Bronson. Many critics will undoubtedly prefer Parker to Wood the former exhibiting a style as familiar as it is primitive.Criminals being followed by floodlights instead of being arrested or surrounded by maniacally laughing crowds instead of being lynched may not make a lot of sense but I'm sure you'll find it in the curriculum of every motion picture academy in the world and of course the inclusion of a jam session does not in any way justify a comparison to a beach monster movie. The young woman isn't pretty nor is she very happy about herself or anybody else for that matter so I suppose it has to be a serious work of art in spite of the crawling severed hands  personally I much prefer to enjoy it on the level of hilariously bad filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dementia 1955  out of 4 Interesting mix of film noir horror and German Expressionism has a young woman struggling to make it through one night on skid row. The movie features no sounds with the exception of a new sound effects so this is clearly a throwback to the silent days and more in point the German classics of the era. This is a rather interesting little film due in large part to the brilliant look and the downright bizarre setup. We're treated to various visuals which make little to no sense but I believe that was the point. I was shocked to see that the wonderful cinematography was by William C. Thompson who was pure poverty row as he worked on films like Maniac Glen or Glenda? Plan 9 From Outer Space and other Ed Wood movies. Adrienne Barrett is very good in the lead and Angelo Rossitto of Freaks fame has a small role. Technically the film is brilliant but the story doesn't come off as well.The most interesting thing about this film is its troubled history which included being banned by the New York Censor Board. The film had to go in front of this board eleven times before it was allowed to be shown only once. The film couldn't get released so it was reedited and narration by Ed McMahon was added. The film was then rereleased as Daughter of Horror and clips from this version can be seen in the 1958 film The Blob inside the theater where the teens are watching it.Daughter of Horror 1958  out of 4 Alternate version of the above film has a couple scenes edited out but the biggest change is the added narration by Ed McMahon. As with other silent films that are given sound the atmosphere and overall mood is certainly altered here but it's rather neat hearing McMahon's narration because he sounds so incredibly different than what we're use to hearing.".

The film was then rereleased as Daughter of Horror and clips from this version can be seen in the 1958 film The Blob inside the theater where the teens are watching it.Daughter of Horror 1958  out of 4 Alternate version of the above film has a couple scenes edited out but the biggest change is the added narration by Ed McMahon. As with other silent films that are given sound the atmosphere and overall mood is certainly altered here but it's rather neat hearing McMahon's narration because he sounds so incredibly different than what we're use to hearing.";

The only part with the sound that actually works for this gem is the dancing scene about 15 minutes in.It isn't really that spooky. It doesn't really offend or even challenge the senses much in my opinion as some have said. There are a few parts that remind me slightly of Eraserhead.In the end I'm not even sure what has happened whether it was ALL a dream SOME of it was a dream or only certain parts were a dream. I ask that because hands don't really move hours after they've been removed DO they? The most interesting scene is where a wave comes over her and the bits of water look like human fingers going over her which is shown a few times at the beginning and a couple of times near the end which seems to relate to the hand that was removed during the crime.It also seems that the director has a hatred for people who like jazz by making them all look like confused and unstable buffoons. This part actually reminds me a lot of Reefer Madness.710 for weirdness. Nothing at all for the ridiculous amateurish narration which basically ruins it and keeps it from having a more spooky flow from start to finish. Again turn the volume completely down the first time you watch it. Trust me on that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like the rest of the Englishspeaking world I've recently succumbed to pokermania and started wasting some of my spare cash in amateur Texas Hold 'Em games.Due to my newfound interest in cardplaying and my appreciation for old movies I picked up The Cincinatti Kid on DVD. And I sure wasn't disappointed. The movie's awesome on so many levels. As you might expect the poker scenes are incredibly tense and from what little I know of the game they're pretty realistic. But other aspects of the film are great too.The New Orleans location shooting is gorgeous. You get to see a lot of the city so I imagine the crew must've spent a fair amount of time there. There's plenty of cool jazz numbers and some nice French Quarter atmosphere. Director Norman Jewison manages to imbue New Orleans and the movie as a whole with an atmosphere that's both sleazy and glamorous at the same time.The strong cast is another highlight. Steve McQueen is understated yet compelling while Joan Blondell hams it up in a highly entertaining fashion I love how she keeps teasing Lancey Howard about his age. Edward G.

And  this is the best part  the movie also features the sweetly beautiful Tuesday Weld and the painfully sexy AnnMargret. You just can't lose with a multigenerational cast of stars and babes like that.Some commentators have complained that The Cincinatti Kid is slow particularly during the scenes that don't feature poker. I can't say that I agree. The McQueenWeld romance is sweet and it doesn't really take up that much screen time. Sure the movie may seem a little plodding if compared to contemporary films but then again even Aliens is plodding compared to contemporary films.The theme song's catchy too. What more do you need? This movie's a miniclassic.".

	onyx:emotionText "Like the rest of the Englishspeaking world I've recently succumbed to pokermania and started wasting some of my spare cash in amateur Texas Hold 'Em games.Due to my newfound interest in cardplaying and my appreciation for old movies I picked up The Cincinatti Kid on DVD. And I sure wasn't disappointed. The movie's awesome on so many levels. As you might expect the poker scenes are incredibly tense and from what little I know of the game they're pretty realistic. But other aspects of the film are great too.The New Orleans location shooting is gorgeous. You get to see a lot of the city so I imagine the crew must've spent a fair amount of time there. There's plenty of cool jazz numbers and some nice French Quarter atmosphere. Director Norman Jewison manages to imbue New Orleans and the movie as a whole with an atmosphere that's both sleazy and glamorous at the same time.The strong cast is another highlight. Steve McQueen is understated yet compelling while Joan Blondell hams it up in a highly entertaining fashion I love how she keeps teasing Lancey Howard about his age. Edward G. Robinson one of my favorite character actors radiates class and even a little menace as Howard. And  this is the best part  the movie also features the sweetly beautiful Tuesday Weld and the painfully sexy AnnMargret.

	schema:headline " A poker classic with suspense realistic characters and a stunning cast";
	schema:reviewBody "Steve McQueen who was deservedly called Mister Cool plays the young upcoming poker player already said to be among the best in the business. But there is one he hasn't played against The Man Lancey Howard played by the great Edward G. Robinson. With the help of his friend Shooter they set up the big fight. While having a high suspense factor in the poker scenes the nonpoker ones might get a bit boring at times especially in the love story between the Kid and his girlfriend Christian. But when it comes to playing this gets almost perfect. McQueen has the ideal poker face and so has Robinson and they both play their parts realistically and brilliantly. McQueen was said not to be a real actor just a poser they said he didn't act he only looked but he proves it wrong here. His facial expressions are perfect and he plays the young hotshot player convincingly.Needless to say the cast is the really stunning cast. Next to the afromentioned McQueen and Robinson there's the always reliable Karl Malden as Shooter. Malden has the most developed character in the picture and he does a great job. And the women oh my god two stunning young ladies are here in all their glory. AnnMargret plays the cheater the femme fatal the sexy beast who's married to Shooter but wants the Kid. Surely one of the most attractive actresses of her time actually all time Ann is presented here in all her glory and beauty and sex appeal. Her seduction of McQueen early in the film is incredibly sexy and played brilliantly. They say Ann learned to act during Carnal Knowledge in '71. but that's not true she already was a versatile and talented actress here. Watch her face during the cockfight scenes or her cheating while doing a jigsaw puzzle she acts naturally and does a great job. And those tight dresses she wears with lots of cleavage are eye candy in its best form. One of the sexiest performances ever. Definitely shows you can be looking divine and having acting talent at the same time.Tuesday Weld plays the good girl the girl from the country Christian and while not as pretty as Ann she's quite a looker too and she's also a talented and natural actress. The supporting cast is rounded out by Joane Blondell Rip Torn Cab Calloway and Jack Weston all great actors who all do a fine job. Music score by Lalo Schifrin is good too and so is the title track sung by legendary Ray Charles.As for the oftenmentioned oftencriticized last hand it's Hollywood only Hollywood not a poker documentary. The film needs a strong climax and gets it. Norman Jewison is a fine director and especially the poker scenes and headshots are well directed. Not much action not much character development but it's not much of a problem. If only Peckinpah had directed now that could have been something Jewison is a great substitute but I like the thought Peckinpah could have even improved it.".

He has the opportunity when the best ones get together in New Orleans for a marathonlenght poker party. It's obvious that the final party would be between The Kid and Lancey Howard very cool Edward G. Robinson. It's a fine classic like almost all Steve McQueenmovies. McQueen is the king of cools and the supporting cast is good too. Tuesday Weld is pretty but AnnMargret is the most seductive chick in town. The cockfight scene and the final poker party is fantastically photographed and wonderfully edited by Hal Ashby who later directed the 'Coming Home'. And the music! Lalo Schifrin is a master and Ray Charles' song is simply fantastic and fits to the set and mood of the movie. The ending is unusual and unpredictable but in my opinion it's very fair. Norman Jewison must have been liked his actors very much. The only flaw is the women hairstyle. But it's an usual thing mostly in the films from the 60s like 'Doctor Zhivago'. Although it's regarded as a classic the wide audience don't  recognize and respect it  'You just not ready for me yet.'".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie isn't boring but it's nowhere near exciting or suspenseful either. It's biggest problem is what's the point? Steve McQueen waits for the game he plays the game he loses the game. The end. 2 hours after I started watching the film my life ain't changed a bit. I wasn't even particularly moved by the Kid losing everything as his opponent's character was classy and sympathetic and Lancey's win also meant Slade's betting money going down the drain. I don't find poker exciting at all so the game itself didn't deliver any suspense and to top it off its outcome was as predictable as they come. The Kid losing all the money in one hand kind of symbolizes the film's failure as nearly all of the drama is supposed to be in the poker game.The film has some more problems. As other reviewers point out the anachronisms are insulting to the viewers intelligence  unless like myself one didn't read that the movie was supposed to take place in the 20's or 30's beforehand. The movie was released in 1965 and most of the settings costumes hairstyles etc. look pretty much like the 60's. The only things hinting at the 30's are black people exclusively staffing all the lowwage jobs bellboy waiter shoe polisher and Kid taking a bus to visit his girl a successful American gambler in the 60's would flytaxi or drive instead. In fact I had found these things as anachronistic before I educated myself reading the forums after the movie ended.Cincinnati Kid concentrates so much on the poker game that a whole bunch of interesting possibilities are ignored and left unresolved. What's Cincinnati about the Kid? What's the meaning of Lancey's presumed illness? What's the card trick about? What experience causes The Man to recommend to a fellow player not to bond with a woman? More issues while I'm on it the movie treats us to a bloody graphic cockfight that serves no purpose at all talk about pointless violence Pulp Fictionbashers. The Shooter character is supposed to be noble and respectable while coming across as weak neurotic and eventually succumbing to a blackmail what Slade had on him anyway???. Additionally we're supposed to believe that a funloving hottie in Melba would fall for and marry this strawberrynosed boring old guy. The movie generally drags and the characters don't develop enough to really empathize with them although you can feel the potential is there.A strong redeeming quality of the movie is the acting. Ed Robinson is perfect as always Steve McQueen does his usual blueyed subtleness and both Tuesday Weld and AnnMargret deliver good performances as well as extremely good looks plus a sweet voice on part of Tuesday. Rip Torn does the best one can do with an onedimensional villain role and similarly Karl Malden with his annoying incoherent character.Generally good actors turn this movie from a waste of time into a fairly engaging experience. Watch for Steve McQueen or sexy AnnMargret but don't look for the advertised drama here..".

These men are gamblers which means the ground rules encompass a desultory and lethal contention of all or nothing. The Cincinnati Kid establishes a dire genre of happenstance adversity that relegates the protagonists to a sink or swim situation. This is carried off in this movie with a very convincing callousness. Steve McQueen is sensational in this movie as is Ann Margaret and so too is Edward G Robinson. Director Norman Jewison does a tremendous job at depicting a scenario whereby life is literally reduced to the luck of the draw.. Suddenly the jack of diamonds stares Steve McQueen in the face and life as he knows it is over. Norman Jewison the director of this film The Cincinnati Kid had a different idea of how this picture should end. Executive producer's wishes for the type of ending this film should have emerged victorious over Jewison's and mollified the catastrophic outcome of this flick.

Robinson at his own game stud poker. McQueen is ever confident while Robinson has seen it all and will not be surprised or scared by anything that he sees on the card table.As in all great movies there is a very strong supporting cast in this film. Led by Karl Malden as the Kid's' confidant Shooter and a trio of strong supporting actresses AnnMargaret Tuesday Weld and Joan Blondell. AnnMargaret portrays Shooter's wife Melba with great flair she sees her husband as a loser and as a weakling. She openly commits adultery and talks down at him in front of anyone. Her characterization appears to be the role model for Fredo Corleone's wife Deanna in The Godfather Part II.'Beyond the obvious supporting roles is one of the best supportingcharacter players of all time Jack Weston. He appears in many films in the 1960s and 1970s often as a person who gets in over his head with people and situations he cannot handle. In this movie he plays Pig' the first victim of Edward G. Robinson at the big card game. Pig thinks he is a pro but quickly and thoroughly gets gutted by the Man.' Weston portrays a similar character in the original Thomas Crown Affair.' Nobody sweats on camera like Jack. His type of adept characterizations can be seen in more recent settings for example William H. Macy's Jerry Lundergard' in 1996's Fargo.'Al in all this is one of the all time classics and by far is my favorite of any of the serious gambling movies such as The Hustler' The Gambler' and The Color of Money.'".

Where its mythology falls short I think stems from the absence of a mentor for the lonely Eric Stoner The Cincinnati Kid.

By inference the only honorable people are either black urbanites seen here either shining shoes or playing jazz music or country folk.

	schema:headline " A classic film about a great game";
	schema:reviewBody "Steve McQueen's answer to Paul Newman's huge success with The Hustler isn't quite as good as the earlier classic but it's still a damn fine movie. Poker is a fascinating game and it therefore makes a great base for a film. The Cincinnati Kid capitalises on that fact and it draws all of it's excitement from the game at it's centre. The type of poker played in this movie is 5 card stud and as a Texas Hold'Em fan I was a little disappointed by this as stud simply isn't as good but poker is poker and 5 card stud is still an admirable base for a film. As implied the film is at it's best when we're watching the action on the table and it's easy to liken the structure of this movie to that of a disaster movie in that it's central theme is the focus and the plot is then bulked out by human drama. The drama side of the story follows Eric Stoner McQueen a gambling man who's been honing his skills and working his way up to a game with 'The Man' Edward G. Robinson. However things are never that simple as when there's money involved there's always someone willing to force it to go their way.Steve McQueen makes a great leading man. His cocky swagger and charisma are always a delight to watch but this combines with his offscreen personality and when watching him I cant help but think about his big headedness when it comes to film billing and the like. However he's not the star of this movie in my eyes as it's Edward G. Robinson that takes that honour. Robinson is a fantastic actor and one that rarely gets his dues when it comes to deciding the greatest actors of all time. Here he adds great believability to his role as the top poker player and he ensures that the atmosphere around his player is one of confidence and authority. And that's how it should be  he is the man. The Cincinnati Kid is exciting throughout but never more so than on the build up to it's conclusion. The ending is one of my favourite of all time and Robinson's line shortly after the end stands up with the greatest lines ever written for cinema. While this film is no Hustler it's still a damn good movie and one that I hugely recommend. Especially if you're a poker player!".

Robinson's suave gambler is also an appealing figure in this movie. There's also some good use of traditional New Orleans jazz but also some nasty obvious strings on the soundtrack as well reminding one of the equally ugly music in director Jewision's 'In the Heat of the Night' made at around the same time.There are obvious parallels between this film and 'the Hustler' but while more modern this film is also simpler in construction there are some sideplots but ultimately the characterisation though strong is static and it all comes down to the cards on the table.

	schema:headline " Woulda coulda movie full of problems";
	schema:reviewBody "This might have been a better and more profound film about maturity and honor had the script dealt more thoroughly on the only two characters who really matter The Kid Eric Stoner Steve McQueen and The Man Lancey Howard Edward G. Robinson. This is their story and there isn't enough of it. Ultimately after the big poker shootout we're left to wonder what it was all about. It ain't just cards and money is it?The script credited to Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern from the novel by Richard Jessup is too much hereandnow. Why is Howard The Man among stud poker players and why is Stoner held in such high regard by the New Orleans gamblers?. Robinson is his usual professional self and does well with what script he has but I wanted to know more about him  e.g. what happened in his earlier years to lead him to tell Stoner to avoid a longterm relationship with a woman? Same for The Kid. Aside from the opening sequence McQueen the action figure has little to do in The Cincinnati Kid. I don't recall ever hearing what he had to do with Cincinnati either but that early sequence  a fight with a sore loser in a smallstakes poker game  does hint at the Kid's origins. It would have been nice to know more about how he acquired the skills needed to take on The Man. McQueen is one of my favorite film actors and he's not bad here. But the The Kid is a younger man mid20s rather than md30s talented and capable but not as entirely confident in himself as McQueen usually came across.Other than the shallow script The Cincinnati Kid has some other serious flaws. Aside from a few old cars and some of the costumes it would be difficult to place this film in the 1930s I'm guessing it's supposed to 193536. McQueen Rip Torn and some of other males look like they've just done a fashion spread for a 1964 issue of Esquire. Anachronistic art direction and costume design were common problems in 1950s60s Hollywood movies set in the 1920s30s though that would change drastically two years later with the work of art director Dean Tavoularis and costume designer Theadora van Runkle on Bonnie and Clyde. The filmmakers here give us some vague notion that this is The Great Depression and of course everyone is supposed to know that the times were tough but there's little of that desperation conveyed on the screen. By way of contrast check out another film set in Depression New Orleans Hard Times Walter Hill's first directorial achievement from 1975 to see the impact of Bonnie and Clyde.The writers put some interesting supporting characters into the film. Tuesday Weld really steals the picture as the girlfriend McQueen loves but can't commit to. Jeff Corey and Cab Calloway have quirky little roles as gamblers but others  Joan Blondell as washedup female cardshark Jack Weston as a greedy overconfident gambler  are predictable and stereotypical. Rip Torn does the villainous decadent Southerner bit that he was turning into a career. AnnMargret was a big star at the time and seemed to revel in playing the sexkitten but her presence in the movie seems more calculated for boxoffice appeal than for logical casting as Karl Malden's greedy wife a rather secondary role at that. Malden has been a good actor for certain types of tough masculine roles but I couldn't believe that his Shooter  a middleaged gambler with integrity but without much charm or future  would attract into marriage a hedonistic and unprincipled babe like AnnMargret's Melba. Shooter is an important character in the film  Stoner's trusted friend who is blackmailed into betraying The Kid's desire for an honest and straightup confrontation with The Man. We need to know more about how Shooter and The Kid got together and came to trust each other.As noted elsewhere this film tried to trade off the popularity of The Hustler as well as the boxoffice appeal of McQueen and AnnMargret. The poker game is the climax of The Cincinnati Kid of course a prolonged shootout in which no blood is shed but a lot of people get hurt. I am no poker player but the game held my attention down to the last hand. One guy has to lose youthful talent or aged experience? And when it's over what of it? The Cincinnati Kid offers only a glimpse of the loser's future and a rather predictable one at that. Most viewers will find The Cincinnati Kid entertaining enough for one look but it is not the kind of film you'll want to see often unless you are a diehard fan of McQueen Robinson or fivecard stud.BTW The French movie that Tuesday Weld's character talks about early in The Cincinnati Kid is a real flick  La Kermesse heroique The Heroic Village Fair which was released in the United States as Carnival in Flanders. This 1935 film a hint to the historic timing of The Cincinnati Kid was directed by Belgianborn Jacques Feyder from a story by Charles Spaak and was highly honored winning the Grand Prix du Cinema Francaise and the Best Foreign Film awards from the New York Film Critics' Circle and the National Board of Review in the United States. It was warmly praised as a satire on European militarism and politics in the 1930s  Nazi Germany at first approved of it then banned it when World War II started  but also came to be seen by some during and after the war as an endorsement of collaboration with an occupying enemy. The Kid's question to his girlfriend What good is honor if your dead? might have come right out of Feyder's film which I finally got to view in 2009.".

	onyx:emotionText "This might have been a better and more profound film about maturity and honor had the script dealt more thoroughly on the only two characters who really matter The Kid Eric Stoner Steve McQueen and The Man Lancey Howard Edward G. Robinson. This is their story and there isn't enough of it. Ultimately after the big poker shootout we're left to wonder what it was all about. It ain't just cards and money is it?The script credited to Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern from the novel by Richard Jessup is too much hereandnow. Why is Howard The Man among stud poker players and why is Stoner held in such high regard by the New Orleans gamblers?. Robinson is his usual professional self and does well with what script he has but I wanted to know more about him  e.g. what happened in his earlier years to lead him to tell Stoner to avoid a longterm relationship with a woman? Same for The Kid. Aside from the opening sequence McQueen the action figure has little to do in The Cincinnati Kid. I don't recall ever hearing what he had to do with Cincinnati either but that early sequence  a fight with a sore loser in a smallstakes poker game  does hint at the Kid's origins. It would have been nice to know more about how he acquired the skills needed to take on The Man. McQueen is one of my favorite film actors and he's not bad here.

	schema:headline " Devastating Blue Eyes";
	schema:reviewBody "I had heard of this movie but only just saw it tonight on TV in Tokyo interspersed with the most hideous Godawful commercials that you could remotely imagine. I always liked Steve McQueen even more so since I met him when I was 13 and he was so nice to me a real gentleman. So I looked forward to seeing this movie with great pleasure.As the plot has been discussed here often I'll just give my impressions.Steve McQueen had the most devastatingly beautiful blue eyes I believe I've ever seen on a man and for the most part they were lit within an inch of their stone cold beauty for the majority of the film. You could just sit and watch his eyes for two hours and be mesmerized. But most of us need more... and I'm not sure this movie offers that. We learn that the Kid Mcqueen is really named Eric  although we don't find that out until he backtracks through his life to go check in on his girlfriend Christian Tuesday Weld. Yes she was called Christian and sometimes Christie. And she doesn't seem to have any other life whatsoever except to exist for the Kid. This was sad that such a pretty young woman would hang her star on a man who was going nowhere fast.What was consistently distracting about this film was everyone calling Mcqueen Kid. Although he was only about 35 years old when he made this film he looked much much older and calling him Kid seemed bizarre.Certain scenes such as the cockfighting scene please get your minds out of the gutter were totally gratuitous and did absolutely nothing to further the story but did make all of the characters seem absolutely heinous.The most interesting person in the film was AnnMargret who stars as Melbaobviously the hottest girl in town. She was at the peak of her beauty and sexuality and she goes for every moment including a scene where she's hardly wearing anything and she reaches for an apple and takes a big juicy bite out of it. She oozes sensuality and knows it and flaunts it. But she too seems to serve absolutely no purpose except as a cocktease now you can put your minds in the gutter and inexplicably as Karl Malden's gal pal... except if you had a gal pal with creamy white jugs spilling out of tight tops you wouldn't ignore her the way Karl does. But then Melba calls Shooter Karl's character a loser which he most definitely is. And Karl! Come on there is no way in hell that I can believe that 1 Karl would play someone called Shooter 2 that he had a reputation for being honest in the gambling business? and 3 that he could possibly allow the Kid to overpower him considering that Karl was bigger than Steve and throw him against a door. I didn't buy his character for one moment. The most interesting moment in the film is when Rip Torn as Slade who obviously is a wealthy white Southerner who's got his fingers in a lot of dirty pies is in bed with a black female of course prostitute and after he finishes his phone call she tries to snuggle with him and he says Don't touch me!  it's all the more interesting when we meet his real wife Midge Ware who is the picture of Southern hospitality and his two fake kids one who looks like she could be his daughter the other who looks like some blonde boy chosen from an adoption agency and who is forced to wear some girlish pink pajamas unless the boy was a girland if so she looked miserable and unhappy for her two minutes on screen.It's fun to see familiar faces Joan Blondell Edward G. Robinson Jack Weston and the story is easy to follow since there are constant announcements throughout the film to make clear we know what is or what might happen. But after they took their third break during the marathon poker game I thought to myself You know what? Maybe I'll hit the 'john' as Joan called it and get myself something to eat and then go to sleep too! The only action in the movie comes near the beginning when one of the men the Kid is playing with accuses him of having marked cards. This results in the Kid escaping from a bathroom window and somehow being close enough to a train transfer track that he can jump on the train walk along the side of it and jump off on the other side. It's actually a great scene... but after that there ain't no action unless you call the Kid swatting Melba's ass action. There are several moments in the film especially during the bathtub scene with Tuesday where Steve seems like he forgot his lines and he actually looks away from Tuesday and for a split second it seems like he's looking at a cue card so he knows what to say next. This is a fun movie if you have absolutely nothing to do some night and you want to see what some of the greats looked like. Yeah there are some fun shots of all the eyes being lit just so as they watch the final round of the poker game and it's fun to see Edward G all dressed up in the fiercest purple smoking jacket I've ever seen but other than Steve's blue eyes and Ann Margret's incredibly sexy bust and creamy white skin and sexy vibe you aren't missing much.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw an interview with director Norman Jewison in which he was asked why he would make a movie about a card game. Where would the excitement come from? Jewison basically said that the excitement came from watching people lose everything. That's a paraphrase of course but accurate enough. Personally though I think the interviewer was correct. Aside from the last hand when the winner of the card game was decided I found precious little to get excited about with this movie. That was a bit of a disappointment. The cast is good. Steve McQueen Karl Malden and Edward G. Robinson are the leads. McQueen is the title character a cocky young player who's out to prove his worth by taking out the veteran Lancey Howard Robinson in a game dealt by Shooter Malden. AnnMargret and Tuesday Weld as the love interests of Shooter and the Kid respectively don't add much to this except some pleasant scenery to be frank and the issues in the respective relationships give a bit of a soap opera feel throughout. In an attempt to add a bit of a subplot there's even some crookedness going on in the game under the direction of Slade Rip Torn. To me though it didn't work. There was no particular reason to like any of these characters  or for that matter to dislike any of them. They came across as surprisingly bland and colourless. I'm not one who thinks that a movie has to be actionpacked to be interesting but for whatever reason this one just didn't grab me. For good performances and a bit of suspense at the end  410.".

I still like the film but can see now its flaws in characterisation plotting and depiction. It's been said before that this is McQueen's The Hustler like Newman's character before a young there's no better word for it hustler with eyes on the prize the top stud poker player around. To achieve this he has to take down The Man Edward G Robinson's Lancey Howard. Culminating in a tense faceoff between the two rivals McQueen's Kid finds out if he has what it takes to be the man or whether he has to accept second best. In actual fact for me the screen relationship between the two lead characters mirrors that of the actors themselves young punk McQueen trying to upstage old established Robinson and it has to be said that the outcome there too is in favour of the older man. Whilst I'm an admirer of McQueen he at times appears to be putting on his coolness whereas with the veteran Robinson it's all effortless poise. Solid dependable Karl Malden does his solid dependable thing in the main supporting role as the carddealer too obviously on the Kid's side but you can never believe that Ann Margret as the sexy young harpy could ever have married him or that he'd be stupid enough to encourage McQueen to chaperone her around. Tuesday Weld is very lightweight as McQueen's real love interest as the curiously named Christian who lives up to her name by improbably forgiving her man's transgressions at the film's conclusion. You sense director Jewison straining for that naturalness between the two that Newman struck up on a pedalbike with Katharine Ross raindrops falling on their heads in Butch Cassidy but the lovers' pastoral scene fails to convince and simply passes by. There are a few attempts to place the movie in its milieu of 30's America but again they seem false not helped by the fact McQueen doesn't even look as if he's wearing the correct clothing for the age. After a fine opening sequence where McQueen engineers a thrilling escape from gamblers he's bested the movie fails to really lift again until the cardplaying climax. In between there are too many uninvolving subplots but the showdown itself is well executed leaving McQueen at the end familiarly slouching into a crouch a la The Great Escape's Cooler King but this time in abject defeat rather than spirited doggedness. In conclusion a film that has dated poorly not helped by a tricksy soundtrack and can't really be placed in the top rank of the best movies of the 60's but a good watch nonetheless particularly for Edward G's performance.".

There were no casinos in those days the '30s. The story takes place in New Orleans.Robinson as Lancey Howard has made a few enemies in his day notably Slater Rip Torn who in these '60s films reminds me of Bradford Dillman. Slater is determined that when Howard hits town he loses to The Kid. Toward that effort he bribes one of the dealers Shooter Karl Malden. The two men finally meet in a poker game one which has breaks  you can't play nonstop for 30 hours. During one of the breaks The Kid tells Shooter that he knows the deal is rigged and insists on a clean game saying that he doesn't need help to win.Subplots concern Melba Shooter's gorgeous wife AnnMargret who is after The Kid and The Kid's romance with a local girl Weld.The poker game is great. It's tense and exciting although the hands are statistically nearly impossible to appear in the same game.McQueen does a lot with a little  a look a stare a smile He was a master of subtle acting plus he has natural presence and sexiness. He died way too soon. The versatile Robinson who could be a downlow crook or a mogul is charming and elegant here.The location the period and the dialogue lend themselves to the atmosphere created. And the cast is terrific  Joan Blondell as a replacement dealer Jack Weston as a fellow player Torn as the angry Slater AnnMargret in top form in looks and sex appeal Malden as the frustrated Shooter  all are excellent.Considered one of the best if not the best poker movie of all time. It's also a wonderful example of how action can take place without car chases and bombs going off.".

What does it mean to win or lose or be the best in this context? The movie doesn't really make sense on its face. Further weaknesses include the dialog which is awfully arch and grating in a pseudopoetic tough guy kind of way and McQueen's performance which has its moments but suffers from being poorly drawn generally his choices in the final third in particular are enigmatic to say the least. It's also kind of a crying shame that two of the most beautiful actresses of that era Weld and Margaret aren't allowed to do much at all.I still sort of liked this mainly because I have a weakness for Hollywood melodramas of that era with all of the soap opery plots and throbbing strings and women in low cut bodices and underscored emotional moments. It's like the cover of a Fiftiesera paperback cover come to life. There are good moments to be had especially from Robinson who brings a lot of shading to his aging gambler. But here we run into scriptconception problems again it doesn't make sense to have your adversary be more appealing and understandable than your lead.

	schema:reviewBody "Has the same improbability clause of other flicks in the same genre. Notwithstanding Chain Reaction has excellent lighting and set design. There is overall a strong dependency on team acting and multiple scene rotations. This gives the film a docudrama effect in the beginning. The fast paced scenes may obscure the plot for some. For me the cinemagraphic effects and acting are A1. Obviously the writing and direction are good or this film would not hold together at all and it does. Because there is little character development the focus is on scene development and approaching plot. This sort of editing technique and direction does not happen by chance and must be recognized as a valid concept. Most certainly a film with character and merit which can be enjoyed by those looking beyond a breadcrumb plot and a gingerbread house script. Good music score odd but good with good sound effects. Forget the trailer which has little or no correspondence to the film itself or maybe it does. This is a rather strange film where one has to believe a group of people with unique ideas came together and produced a rather odd film with value. I enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eddie Keanu Reeves works on a scientific team that is searching for lowcost energy sources that are good for the environment too.  One day it seems that such a discovery has been made.  Soon after however the chief scientist is murdered and the invention stolen.  Eddie and fellow team member Dr. Lily Sinclair Rachel Weisz are suspects in the murder and are forced to go on the run.  Naturally the police and the FBI are in hot pursuit.  Another team member Paul Morgan Freeman may have some secrets to hide as well.  Will the truth come out and will the fleeing duo be captured?This movie is mostly a chase picture and a moderately successful one. Much of the action is centered on the capture of Eddie and Lily.  There is an impressive scene for example where Eddie is trying to avoid seizure by climbing a raised bridge.  Unfortunately not all of the scenes are as effective.  The scientific elements are quickly rushed over causing some confusion as to what has transpired.  As for the romance between Reeves and Weisz it is nicely subdued.  It's there but only manifests itself in a few embraces.  Although the ending is quite exciting the overall effect of the movie as an action flick is only partly realized.  There are some missing plot elements that would have raised it to a higher level.  Recommended as a fairly good action motion picture Reeves fans certainly will enjoy it.".

But under the circumstances of the story there was no time to establish the love story.This movie for me was a character study. The characters in this film were well developed and convincing. The ambiguity of Morgan Freeman's character was interesting.  For instance I never knew where Morgan Freeman's character was coming from or what his intentions were with Keanu. And the elevator scene close to the end shocked me. And he was smoking his cigar the entire time. I liked seeing Keanu play a simple guy. Being a hero accidentally fell on his shoulders to me. When he and Rachael are running from the bad guys whoever they were and they go on the ice sled machine he starts the machine up and it goes out of control for a minute. When she questions him he replies The best I can. Now I don't know about you but that's impressive for a man to be real and unsure of the shaky circumstances that were dealt.

	schema:reviewBody "OK let's start the movie with a physics professor lecturing a huge class about combining hydrogen and oxygen a chemical reaction which produces water and referring to it as nuclear fusion or at least talking about getting fusionlevel energies from a blatantly chemical process.Ah where do we want to go from there? Unfortunately the writers of this tripe decided that changing direction and going up was out of the question. I guess they had mud in their ears from digging that preposterously deep hole which prevented them from hearing the question at all.From there people do remarkably stupid things and fail in remarkably stupid ways and allow SuperKeanu to save the day!!!. This is what is called the idiot plot. The only reason the plot advances is because every single character involved is a complete and total idiot so that not one of them can figure out the one thing out of many million one things which would stop the nefarious villains in their tracks!! If you failed sixth grade science and never looked back then you might enjoy this movie. If not you will probably find more pleasure from watching Manos Hand of Fate and drinking a shot of whiskey every time 3 minutes of washedout scenery pass by on the screen and smiling with the inward knowledge that by the end of Manos you too will be able to write a script which is better than the one at the heart of Chain Reaction.I ask you Am I the ONLY person who is capable of thinking of hiring a bright highschool tech geek to vette scripts for oh 500 a pop for blatantly imbecilic science errors? Especially if the scripts are supposed to center on science basics? This movie was going to be bad no matter what but for cryin' out loud at least get the parts correct that you can get correct for cheap!".

	schema:reviewBody "My Take A formulaic action movie with some impressive set pieces marred by lackluster writing.Student machinist Keanu Reeves is framed for murder and sabotage of a research laboratory he works in and is forced to run for his life while trying to prove his innocence. This is not another sequel to THE FUGITIVE it's actually CHAIN REACTION a techno chasethriller from director Andrew Davis who also directed THE FUGITIVE. Like in that superior film Davis displays his skills at staging perfectly exciting yet quite plausible action sequences. Unfortunately the script this time is built around the action rather than vice versa.The film's plot about the discovery of water as a main component for creating a cheaper source of energy is almost abandoned for most of the film in favor of a fairly ordinary chase thriller that has Reeves running from the FBI after being suspected for sabotage being the only person alive after the explosion of the lab. And boy does he run! The chase moves from jumping from a bridge to chases in snowmobiles or helicopters. In fairness Davis stages action very well and the stunts here are just what we expect from the man who perfectly staged the train wreck scene in THE FUGITIVE. Unfortunately the movie stops being thrilling when it becomes a bit too predictable and rather pointless. It's just one chase after another as Reeves and companion Rachel Weisz dodges the feds for 107 minutes until they unmask the true saboteur which I suspect the audience may have already found out halfway.Morgan Freeman is pretty good in a role that demands more of him and Reeves is once again more impressive in the action rather than in the acting. But unlike in other movies like SPEED Reeves fails to even display charisma or exhibit any chemistry with his female costar Weisz or is it because their characters really just doesn't have enough time to connect?. And when it all finally comes to a close it didn't feel quite like the end of a movie but the end of a really long chase of chase. As cinematic junk food goes CHAIN REACTION is harmless and watchable but even other mindless action movies have more meat than this.Rating 12 out of 5.".

Freeman's character is deliberately ambiguous and he does a good job at keeping us guessing. Handsome Keanu Reeves not really a great actor is nevertheless not a bad actor either so he is able to hold his own.I don't mind a film being derivative but my basic problem with this one occurs at the beginning. For me there just wasn't enough setup.

	schema:reviewBody "Eddie Kasalivich is a student machinist working on a project at the University of Chicago to obtain energy from water when he discovers the secret of a process by which lowcost energy can be obtained from burning hydrogen leaving only water as a residue. The exact science is not always clear but this appears to be some sort of nuclear fusion. Someone however obviously wants to sabotage Eddie's discovery and one of his colleagues is murdered and the laboratory is destroyed in a massive explosion. Eddie and another colleague Dr. Lily Sinclair are questioned by the police and the FBI and quickly realise that someone is trying to frame them for both the murder and the explosion. They are forced to go on the run to try and clear their names and to expose the true culprits.It is not just the science upon which the film is based that is unclear the plot too is often overelaborate and difficult to fathom. We eventually learn that the real villains are agents of the Government and of Big Business who are desperate to suppress Eddie's discovery because they fear that a new cheap environmentally friendly source of energy would make oil obsolete force all oil companies into bankruptcy and lead to economic depression and social chaos. In fact capitalism is rather more adaptable than the screenwriters imagine a new energy source of this nature by dramatically reducing industry's energy costs would more likely lead to an economic boom and huge profits for those companies who could exploit this lucrative new technology. Existing energy companies would probably be among them just as many stagecoach owners made a fortune from the invention of the steam train by reinvesting their money in railway shares. The only people with a vested interest in preventing such inventions reaching the market would be the governments of those countries which possess vast reservoirs of crude oil and very little else but the filmmakers doubtless thought that in paranoid conspiracythrillers like this one the United States Government makes a better villain than do foreign ones.Keanu Reeves's performance as Eddie is adequate but not outstanding. Rachel Weisz as Lily in her first starring role in a Hollywood film is rather muted and gives little indication that she would later develop into a major talent. Probably the best acting comes from the generally reliable Morgan Freeman as Paul Shannon Eddie's old mentor who may have a sinister agenda but Chain Reaction is not one of the really great Freeman films like Glory Unforgiven or The Shawshank Redemption.The film does have some better qualities. The director Andrew Davis has been praised by his visual sense and Chain Reaction is visually very attractive. The action takes place in winter and there is some striking photography of a wintry snowbound Chicago especially the scenes set in the grim industrial districts and around the astronomical observatory which plays an important part in the plot. The action sequences are exciting fastmoving and well handled.Davis has a reputation for specialising in thrillers. His films tend to vary in quality but he has at least one very good one to his credit The Fugitive one of the best thrillers of the nineties. That film also dealt with a man forced to go on the run after being falsely accused of a crime. Chain Reaction is not in the same class as The Fugitive but it is a watchable thriller with some points of interest. 610".

Reeves is his usual monotone self Weisz is a complete drip and Freeman now looks pretty clichd in his natty Malcolm X looking 90's suit and hat.

The supporting talented cast like Fred Ward Kevin Dunn Brain Cox Joanna Cassidy Chelcie Ross and Tzi Ma are wasted here. Some moments in the movie it feels like a watereddown remake of The Fugitive. Which director Davis also made that excellent film. But the director keeps us fairly entertained with the action chase sequences and the performances of Reeves Weisz and Freeman are fine if nothing special. If the screenwriters worked hard on the script this could have been a great thriller. Reeves and Weisz worked together again in the actionhorrorfantasythriller Constantine. Chain Reaction is a true mixed bag of a movie.  ".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great thinking man's Action film that's action packed through with a very cool story and fantastic performances!. All the characters are great and sure it may be a bit confusing to follow at times but i still really enjoyed it plus Keanu Reeves and Morgan Freeman are simply amazing in this!. Reeves and Rachel Weisz had awesome chemistry together and Brian Cox played a cool bad guy plus the finale is simply excellent!. I thought Reeves acting was fantastic! and it had some cool plot twists as well plus i really dug the opening as well!. Fred Ward is no Tommy Lee Jones though even though he did a good job and i thought the finale was very exciting! plus you really root for Keanu and Rachel throughout the film!.The chase scenes are simply awesome and i thought it was exciting and suspenseful throughout plus it's very underrated as well. Yes it's extremely similar to the Fugitive but it also has it's own ideas as well and i thought the ending was really cool plus one of my favorite scenes is the chase scene on the Bridge. This is a great thinking man's action film that's action packed throughout with a very cool story and fantastic performances i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Andrew Davis does a great job here with very good camera work stunning angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is fantastic!. Keanu Reeves is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable fantastic in the acting department is very charismatic had very good chemistry with Rachel Weisz is an excellent leading man in my opinion and was just very focused and on top of things he was amazing. Reeves Rules!!!!!!. Morgan Freeman is also amazing as always and is amazing here he had a very mysterious and interesting character added a lot of presence was quite likable intense and was just amazing overall! Freeman rules!!!. Rachel Weisz is excellent here she is very beautiful vulnerable had great chemistry with Reeves and was just very convincing i liked her a lot.Fred Ward is awesome as the FBI agent and while he is no Tommy Lee Jones he still did an awesome job i really liked him. Kevin Dunn is OK as Ward's partner and did what he had to adequately. Brian Cox is great as the main villain and was quite menacing. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. 12 out of 5".

The screenwriters obviously tried to make an intelligent script about using hydrogen as a source of energy but it just doesnt make much sense.

After some celebrating he and Rachel Weisz return to the laboratory only for it to go up in flames. Reeves and Weisz are framed for a murder and must clear their names while Morgan Freeman confronts police. Production is nothing new and despite Andrew Davis being able to shoot action scenes he is basically reciting what worked much better in his masterpiece The Fugitive. Keanu Reeves spends nearly the whole film running and unfortunately he didn't run far enough because he still found his way back on the set. Morgan Freeman should leave the oneliners to the comedians. Weisz is there because the script called for a female and she obviously fits the description. Like Reeves she spends nearly the whole film running and getting nearly blown to bits. Fred Ward plays a cop on the scene which is pretty standard and Kevin Dunn plays his partner. Together they are unable to rescue these roles from the avalanche of clichs. It is a pointless action driven disaster that should be used to test fire crackers on. Score 1  10".

It could have come out of Screen writing for Dummies. There is intrigue and suspense in the story but only enough of a plot to link the violent episodes together or the chase scenes just as there's enough plot in a pornographic movie to bring the performers physically together.The casting and direction are able to clear the same very low bar. The evildoers look ugly. The wellmeaning but confused FBI guys look wellmeaning but confused. The two innocent leads are beautiful. Not a single opportunity is wasted in pumping up the adrenalin of the viewers. If a hero is being chased across the Michigan Avenue drawbridge and it begins to open he must reach the very end of the tilted structure and dangle from it. If he and the heroine run through a tunnel while being pursued he must hold her hand and pull her along behind him. They can outrace exploding fireballs.Why go on? It's an effective chase thriller if that's what you're looking for. And Morgan Freeman gives an outstanding performance saddled as he is with lines like The world isn't all that simple Eddie. What's most bothersome is that the problem that should be at the heart of this heartless movie is almost entirely dispensed with. Homo sapiens' place in the ecosystem in which he plays such an important part is hardly dealt with  not even in passing. Our place in nature seems to be too important to be used as a Hollywood gimmick a device to hang an uninspired plot from. I don't mean the movie has to be full of gravitas. But even comedies have done a better job of dealing with the kinds of questions this film raises. See The Man in the White Suit for an example.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Everything You Always To Know About Sex' is probably the last time Woody Allen really fooled about and made an ass of himself with minimal artistic pretenses and given the mediocre quality of recent disposable duds like 'Melinda  Melinda' and 'Anything Else' it's quite refreshing. True this 1972 collection of extremely lewd skits isn't quite as impressive and thoughtprovoking as some of Allen's best works like 'Annie Hall' 'Manhattan' or for that matter even the followup 'Sleeper' yet there's an energy to 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know' that Allen has not shown for at least a decade and in that light it's still entirely classic.If anything the film is closest in its spirit to early Allen films like 'Bananas' and 'Sleeper' but it actually feels more like a British comedy and is clearly influenced by shows like 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' and 'The Benny Hill Show' in it's chaotic and rude humor. Still Allen's mark is all over the skits even when he isn't in them. One of the best of the bunch in fact is the skit titled 'What Is Sodomy' which stars Gene Wilder. Influences of both Monty Python and Mel Brooks can be felt in it but it's entirely Allen and still it's Wilder that makes it perfect. Even more Pythonish is the fabricated gameshow 'What's Your Perversion'.The best and most memorable is the last skit entitled 'What Happens During Ejaculation' in which Allen does a wonderful portrayal of a sperm and we catch a glimpse of the action in the control room of a man's body during sexual intercourse. The skit is brilliantly satirical and ranks with Allen's best moments nearly overshadowing the rest of the film. Still it's not without it's unforgettable moments other than Wilder also worthy of special praise is John Carradine who is wonderful as the ultimate parody of a mad scientist and let's not forget Woody Allen as a fool in the Middle Ages misquoting Hamlet and getting his hand stuck up the Queen's chastity belt and his wonderful performance as an Italian Casanova.So no it's not quite one of Allen's best films but it's close. The humor is dirty yes but not childish Allen's intelligence is there but it's much lighter than 'Annie Hall' or other classics and like a Monty Python or a Mel Brooks it bears multiple viewings. A movie that's funny as hell essential for Allen fans and recommended for all.".

Here Allen's filmmaking approach is more selfserving than ever before casting himself as a medieval standup comedian a heroic leading man and a sperm yet still finding time to feature in a lengthy satire on earlyseventies European cinema.  The reason it all comes together without succumbing to selfimportance is down to the simplicity and stupidity of most of the set pieces.The more interesting segments come at the beginning of the film and if seeing Woody trying hopelessly to unlock Lynn Redgrave's chastity belt and missquoting Shakespeare to form a condemnation of T.B. doesn't bring a smile to your face then the sight of Gene Wilder in the throws of foreplay with a sheep will probably do little to convert you.  Humour for the most is juvenile puerile and immature but carried off with such hilarious comedic style that the Farrelly brothers should really reassess their careers. Allen is as likable as ever in his many surreal incarnations  appearing in fifty percent of the sketches  his ultimate triumph being the oily Italian playboy causing a stir when he and his frigid girlfriend partake of a little outdoor nookie.  And even if he is less confident when trying to be sociosatirical as in the molestation game show Woody still manages to inject a wit and ingenuity to the proceedings always carrying off the gags to his trademark selfdeprecating style.However despite technical assuredness the finished product borders on the same hit and miss territory that befalls most anthology films however it has to be handed to Allen for making a genuinely intelligent movie that basically celebrates boobgags and outbursts of rampant misogyny.   The best policy with 'Everything you always wanted to know...' is to ignore the false starts of the later segments and howl at the sight of Woody fighting a giant breast Don't worry I know how to handle tits.  Nevertheless if your idea of sophisticated humour doesn't include bestiality orgasms transvestism homosexuality ejaculation perversion or Burt Reynolds then feel free to give it a miss.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everything You Always Wanted to Know... is frequently looked down upon as it fulfils its promise completely. That is it contains a lot of sex.To downplay the film on such a level is to do it a disservice what may be overlooked is that apart from the subject matter and the brevity with which such a topic is treated this is shot extremely well.A notable example of this is Allen's technique of having actors speaking with their backs to the camera. A very European style of filming and one which understandably is most brought into play during the third vignette a pitchperfect satire of continental cinema. Also look out for the grandscale surrealism that occupies the last two sequences a 400foot breast rolling down a wellshot hillside or a giant tongue may seem crude in context but looked at solely for cinematic technique this is pure Fellini. This may seem to be overstating it but never has a bawdy slightly crass comedy vehicle been so well conceived for the big screen. Even the opening sequence involving a multitude of white rabbits is shot with the screen in mind a twitching nose and red eye the only objects punctuating an effective white counterpoint for the introductory credits.And so to the content itself which doesn't match the quality of the production and sags in the middle. The first three sketches are quite wonderful the third as mentioned is exquisite and the scenes with Gene Wilder romancing a sheep may not be as sophisticated but are probably the funniest. The first sketch sees Woody as a medieval jester paraphrasing Shakespeare though the gags really don't get any better or more tasteful than T.B. or not T.B. that is the congestion. For this is a film that has no limits and its content flirts with notions of bestiality transvestism the female orgasm ejaculation and sex in public places. Not all of these are carried off particularly well the transvestite sketch falling resolutely flat. There is also evidence of Woody's homophobia casting himself as a sperm dreading being ejected during a homosexual encounter. In fact an eighth sketch was filmed which suggested homosexuality arises as a direct consequence of fear of women. This was cut not on bounds of taste but due to the fact that Woody couldn't think of a good enough punchline.Worst point of the film though has to be the What's My Perversion? segment. While extremely satirical this one leaves an extremely bad taste in the mouth as Woody seems to be going fullout to offend with this piece. While the basic idea could cause some amusement seeing a panellist quizzing a contestant as to whether he's a rapist or a child molester is several stages beyond funny. Simarily the sketch ends with a Rabbi's wife on her knees eating pork. An unnecessary addition to the film.However it is of importance in terms of Woody's screen character. The rough edges arrogance and pseudointellectualism of his midseventies work onwards has yet to emerge and here we still have Woody very much as he was in Casino Royale  ie. a bit of a nerd and on the losing end of life. Amazing to think that in just two years time he was writing himself as a lothario who was exceptionally good in bed.In conclusion then a worthwhile view if you're a student of film or a fan of Woody's but if you're watching this one for the comedy then it's purely hitandmiss.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex is a success for Woody Allen if only for him being able to go through a whole host of satirizing that is always if not hilarious cleverly crafted and impeccably cast. Certain scenes I would mark as some of the funniest I've still ever seen from Woody Allen. But like a Monty Python sketch movie ala the Meaning of Life you may or may not get all of the scenes consistently on edge and classic. But in terms of experimenting with form it is one of the very best that Woody has come up with at a time when he was making his early funny movies.The highlights for me include the climactic err maybe pun intended end sequence showing the inner workings with Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds present in the control room of intercourse the faux game show involving sexual questions and yes that is Regis Philbin with a truly bellylaugh of a finale involving a Jewish mother best is the Gene Wilder sheep scene which was my favorite when I first saw the film as a kid. Interestingly enough even when there are segments that aren't as funny as the others the scifi spoof with the giant boob or the opening segment sent in medieval times it does become a little more humorous in future viewings. One that really did become funnier seen in my older years is the foreign film spoof where Italian mixes with god knows what almost deadon spoof wise.Is the film on the brilliance level of Manhattan or Deconstructing Harry? Maybe in spots but on a very different level. I could almost see myself recommending the film to those who are new to the Allen filmography. It's unpretentious and very keen on the subject matter at the peak of the sexual revolution something that might've inspired the ZAZ team for their Kentucky Fried Movie. Or at the least have wondered what it's like when Wilder puts SM garb on a sheep it's worth a viewing some of his dialog with the sheep is a killer every single time I see it. Cute opening titles by the way.".

	schema:headline " That was really something. I never thought it could be like this. Never in my wildest imagination.";
	schema:reviewBody "Forever unwilling to go with the flow of conventional movie making Woody Allen went to the off limits topic of sex with his 1972 feature Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex  But Were Afraid to Ask. Bringing together an allstar cast including Gene Wilder Burt Reynolds and Tony Randall in a way only Woody Allen can in a series of vignettes to explore the book by David Reuben of the same title. Seven separate episodes make one movie and the only thing they all have in common is their subject matter and the fact that they were excerpts from Reuben's book.In the first episode Woody Allen acts as a jester trying to seduce the queen in an effort to find out if aphrodisiacs work. The second segment delivers Gene Wilder as a medical doctor dealing with a man who brings the confession to him that he is in love with a sheep only to fall in love with the same sheep. The third segment again features Allen as a married man who is having trouble giving his wife an orgasm unless they have intercourse in public. The fourth segment involves a married man who is a cross dresser at a dinner party who just can't stay out of his wife's dresses. The fifth segment involves a game show where people share their deepest sexual secrets with a panel of celebrities trying to guess what they are. The sixth episode features a team of scientists and a runaway breast. The final vignette features Allen again this time as a sperm to illustrate for the audience what happens during ejaculation. Each scene of course with the brilliant comedic writing of Allen is a joy to watch no matter how guilty you feel watching it.This film reminds me why I love Woody Allen. Really is there a better comedic writer than him? I was happy to see Gene Wilder's segment early on. It's tough to watch anthology movie just to see one actor so his being early on was a nice treat. Even though I started out watching this only for Gene you'll stick with it for Woody Allen. I love his brand of humor just above the brow and wish more comedies of today could be like this. Wilder's performance as an M.D. who falls in love and starts a relationship with a sheep shows his range as an actor. He was funny and serious when necessary and illustrates his comedic acting abilities! The most incredible part of his performance was the 24second scene that showed his reaction to the man in his office confessing his love for a sheep. That reaction is something all actors should aspire to and needs to be required viewing at film schools and the like. Watching Gene Wilder in a Woody Allen film is enough to make one nostalgic for what could have been if only the two had more pairings. Of course the collaboration between Wilder and Mel Brooks was incredible likewise was the joining of he and Richard Pryor but I wish there had been more AllenWilder films. Maybe it's not too late these two legends are still with us and although Wilder is retired from acting perhaps a great Allen script could be the one to bring him back. I'll hold out hope while enjoying the film they did make.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the late 1960s one Dr David Reuben released a book entitled EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK. Woody Allen's 1972 movie adaptation uses the questions of Dr Reuben's questionandanswer format as the titles for 7 comedic sketches all on sexual themes. This was Allen's third conventional film and his growing importance in Hollywood is evident from the film's allstar cast.The opening Do Aphrodisiacs Work? set in medieval times has Woody Allen as a court jester who seeks to seduce the queen. Most of the humour here consists of anachronism the jester's jokes are too bad for even a borscht belt comedian and the dialogue consists of Elizabethian stylings mixed with sexual terminology and crude slang from the present.The following sketch What is Sodomy? is for many viewers the very best. A New York City general practitioner Gene Wilder is visited by an Armenian shepherd who begs the doctor to restore the magic to his relationship with a cherished sheep. What ensues with the doctor descending ever deeper into madness is made hilarious by Wilder's committed performance and the dialogue is immensely quotable. Another high point of the film is Why Do Some Women Have Trouble Reaching an Orgasm?. Shot in black and white and with an Italian dialogue the segment is Allen's homage to the cool ambiance of Antonioni and Fellini. Allen plays a suave sunglasseswearing film director who cannot manage to satisfy his wife played by Louise Lasser until they begin having risky sex in public places. The fun comes not only in the challenges the man must face in making his wife happy but also in Allen's ridiculous accent while speaking Italian.In Are Transvestites Homosexuals? Lou Jacobi plays a man who sneaks upstairs while at a dinner party in order to wear his hostess' clothes and subsequently gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble. It's humorous enough but one wonders if this segment were stronger when the film was first released. Judging from its high frequency in big Hollywood films of the 1960s and early 1970s crossdressing must have once been a much funnier concept in that era. The following What Are Sex Perverts? is a parody of the game show What's My Line? where a panel of minor celebrities try to guess the perversion of a contestant who wins 5 for every wrong guess. This is quite funny but far too brief as the concept could have been stretched out a bit more.Are the Findings of Doctors and Clinics Who Do Sexual Research and Experiments Accurate? is a Frankenstein parody where Allen and Heather MacRae play recently acquainted sex researchers who meet a great sexologist John Carradine only to discover that he's a diabolical madman. The first half of this segment is pretty funny as Allen and MacRae make their way through the doctor's castle of horrors. But the second half when the pair seeks to defeat a giant breast ravaging the countryside is some of the lamest humour I've seen in some time.The characters of the last segment What Happens During Ejaculation? are personifications of the organs as a man goes on a date with a woman. The brain is depicted as a NASA mission control with Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds struggling to coordinate bodily functions. They call down to the stomach men carting off a newlyarrived load of fettucini and the genitals bluecollar joes working an enormous pump as well as other places. Much here will make you chuckle such as the captured saboteur of the man's sexual ambitions his conscience depicted as a priest in a Roman collar and Allen's performance as a sperm cell terrified of making the leap into the unknown. All in all however I find this quite dated as well.While my overall impressions is that EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX is quite dated it's funny enough and the portions with Allen as an Italian lover and Wilder as a befuddled doctor make it worth seeing at least once.".

As said most of the segments work apart from two Are Transvestites Homosexuals? is completely unmemorable dialogue and gagswise and the ending may leave a bad taste in the mouth and What Are Sex Perverts? has a clever idea that completely runs out of steam quickly and is very tasteless. Do Aphrodisiacs Work? is too long drags a bit and a touch forced at times but is very quotable Allen is endearing even with his character's intentionally awful jokes and Lynn Redgrave is great.

The sheep's adorable as well. The highlight segment is What Happens During Ejaculation? it's the most quotable and most consistently funny of the seven and with its surreal quality is visually the most imaginative as well. In conclusion uneven but of the seven segments only two are misses the others are either ones with shortcomings but have enough to make them work or strong hits. 7.510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Though it is all about sex Woody Allen's EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK is really all about movies. Taking Dr. David Reuben's book a pop culture phenomenon of the late 1960s Woody uses it only as a starting point for indulging in his second greatest passion filmmaking. Indeed he tosses aside most of Reuben's selfhelp nonfiction sex manual and only quotes chapter titles as inspiration for his various vignettes each designed to parody some aspect of our pop media. What the book and the movie do have in common however is that they are products of their time postsexual revolution prepolitically correctness and as such their outlook on their common topic is a bit dated.SEX the movie is best thought of as being seven individual short films a few that are hilarious or at least clever and a couple that just fall flat. The ones that stray most from the movies as their source come off worse. For instance Are Transvestites Homosexuals? is second rate sitcom Middleaged man is caught trying on dresses while visiting his daughter's new inlaws. It is a onegag skit though burly Lou Jacobi makes the most of the material as the giddy crossdressing poppa. Meanwhile What Are Sex Perverts? begins with a clever concept but is defeated by its own awkward attempts to be outrageous. Staged as a 1950's TV game show  grainy blackandwhite images and all  What's My Perversion? looks authentic but tries to trivialize sexual deviancy for dubious comic effect. Scattered throughout Woody's filmography are tossedoff asides trying to find snickers in wisecracks about rape or child molestation or incest and other sundry unfunny sexual tragedies and invariably such unnecessary pseudoad libs land with a resounding thud. What's My Perversion? is made up mostly of such discomforting quips and builds to a joke about a rabbi getting off by watching his wife eat pork. I think Woody is the only person who ever finds such cheap jabs at rabbis even remotely funny.Fortunately the rest of he skits come off much much better. The vignette Do Aphrodisiacs Work? makes fun of Shakesperean dramas and other similar costume epics while simultaneously paying homage to one of Woody's screen idols Bob Hope. Like Hope Woody contributes wisecracking anachronistic oneliners as a lustful Court Jester with the hots for his Queen. The bit isn't well written with Woody relying far too heavily on intentionally awful puns but playing Allen's low camp humor about chastity belts off the hightoned pomposity of Elizabethan drama somehow makes it work decently.The two best vignettes also work well because Woody plays them close to the style of their inspirations. Are the Findings of Doctors and Clinics Who Do Sexual Research Accurate? mimics cheesy gradeD drivein horror movies of the sixties with mad scientist John Carridine hamming it up gleefully in a calculated selfparody. The absurd premise involving a giant mutant female breast terrorizing the countryside The cream slowed him up and the milk killed him! builds to the most awesomely silly climax in any Woody Allen movie. The segment is topped however by What Happens During Ejaculation? which takes the phrase mechanical sex to its most logical extreme. The segment mimics the Kubrickian coldness of contemporary scifi portraying the male human body as a giant and notparticularlycoordinated space station on a carnal mission to boldly go where other men have apparently come and gone before. With Woody taking a small role literally as an anxious sperm awaiting for his first and only mission the segment is silly yet true enough to almost be worthy of inclusion in a basic biology class.Yet from a somewhat a different perspective the remaining episodes might be the most intriguing. They are What is Sodomy? and Do Some Women Have Trouble Reaching Orgasm? the former being about a doctor Gene Wilder who has an affair with a sheep and the latter about a woman Louise Lasser who is aroused by sex in public places. Both are amusing in their own right but the added consideration is that Woody uses them to parody the types of films he would soon eagerly try to imitate. Sodomy though hilarious in its deadpan way is not all that different in stilted tone or pretentious theme from Allen's later efforts like INTERIORS ANOTHER WOMAN or HUSBANDS AND WIVES. And as such the aloof ennui that he mimics from Bergman and Antonioni for Orgasm would reappear with deadly earnest in those same films. It is curious that Woody would eventually embrace stylistics that he had first found so easy to ridicule. Maybe that is why he so ardently avoided any trace of humor in those later films he realized just how easily they can lapse into selfparody.With its leering bawdy approach to sex the film reflects little of Reuben's glib simplistic text and instead has more in common with the pseudosophisticated raunchiness of the Playboy magazine of the era. Yet in its juvenile way there is something almost innocently naughty about the movie that makes it almost quaint  especially when compared to today's standards of vulgarity. As such EVERYTHING YOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX is something of a period piece reflecting a time when being outrageously tasteless was something unique and not something tiresomely routine.".

The quality ranges from horrible to hilarious.In the first Allen plays a court jester who uses an aphrodisiac to seduce a queen Lynn Redgrave. Unfortunately she has a chastity belt on! Very funny and we else can you see Redgrave wearing a chastity belt? The second has Gene Wilder as a doctor falling in love with a sheep! Don't worryit's not explicit. It's OK. The third is a funny parody of foreign films complete with subtitles where Allen has trouble getting his wife Louise Lasser to orgasm. Good idea but it has no ending. The fourth is easily the weakestit has Lou Jacobi who loves to wear womens clothes. The fifth is a parody of the old TV game show What's My Line. It's shot in bw and is called What's My Perversion. It has a very young Regis Philbin in the cast! The sixth has John Carradine as a mad scientist what else? who accidentally invents a giant breast that roams the countryside drowning people with milk! The last is the bestit shows what happens in a man's body during sex. It has Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds in the mind and Allen playing a nervous sperm!Tasteless to be sure but even the bad skits have some great lines. The content isn't THAT badexcept for the breast there is no nudity but there is a lot of frank sexual talk. If you can deal with sex and laugh at it you might like this movie. Otherwise stay away.

All contain brilliant one liners and all can provide a joke or two. It's just a shame that some are consistently funnier than others.As an early work there are definite signs in this film of Woody Allen's future potential. Sadly though with a film which has not aged well and which is not regular enough in it's humour this is not one of Allen's finest films. Watch the following year's Sleeper instead it's much more entertaining.".

One of his earliest films was another tale of older manyounger woman amour fou called One Wild Moment which was remade in America as Blame It on Rio with Michael Caine in Marielle's role. And speaking of older men and younger women Emmanuelle Seigner is the young woman who bewitched rakish director Roman Polanski when she was only 17 and he's been married to her ever since. This movie was right after her incredible performance in Polanski's Bitter Moon andwhile it's perhaps not saying a lotthis is one of her best performances in a nonPolanski film.Naturally this film has no English subs but it's fairly easy to follow even if you don't really speak French besides there's always the international language of a hot French girl getting naked.

	schema:reviewBody "Now You See Me has a stellar cast a fun and intriguing premise and themes showdown of rival magicians combined with a heist delightful smartassery and cunning tactics  especially in those scenes dominated by Jesse Eisenberg or Woody Harrelson. Oh and it has quite dazzling action sequences. All the best parts of this film are wellpackaged and sold in the gripping theatrical trailer.I took someone I loved to Now You See Me and expected the payoff of a perfect night of entertainment.I'm not impossible to please at the movies and I actively wanted this to be a good time. I went out for entertainment and leisure and in good company and high spirits not at all for the purpose of writing a critical review.What's more I'm a big fan of all of the raw ingredients in this film. I enjoy magic and I could watch Morgan Freeman or Michael Caine in almost anything now proved. I fully enjoyed a much better film called The Prestige which might be regarded by some as a predecessor.But what happened here?After several fun scenes and a promising opening sequence that made me want to care about the characters I discovered a film in search of a plot and utterly lacking intellectual integrity and respect for the audience. The twists and reversals weren't just surprising they were completely unbelievable. You didn't see it coming but not because of skillful misdirection the art of magicians so often implied. Rather you didn't see it coming because the explanations were crooked and cooked up and merely expedient.Especially by late in the film when they start tracking backward to earlier events to show you how you were fooled and what was really going on the whole time  the explanations presented are less convincing than simply believing in real magic.!!!Spoler Alert Stop reading here if you would like to watch this movie without knowing anything about the late scenes reveals and reversals!!!For example the Four Horsemen stage the death of one of their own by perfectly orchestrating a highspeed traffic accident on a crowded bridge. It's imperative that the car he's apparently driving flips and tumbles several times and ultimately bursts into flames. But it's equally imperative that the pursuing detective can retrieve a stack of papers from the wrecked car. He must be able to retrieve the papers but not the body all while getting away with his own life or else the plot begins to unravel. The timing is of course worked out impeccably and it's carried out with no other fatalities on the bridge. And somehow the magicians have stuffed a replacement body from the morgue into an identical car just before turning it into a timebomb. The audience knows emotionally that the Dave Franco character shouldn't really be dead as I heard one person exclaim loudly during the closing sequence when Jack Wilder shows up again but the way his death is apparently faked would defy an unlimited budget and dozens of trained stunt drivers and coordinators  unless of course you close the bridge to public traffic. Yet it's just one more miracle that the Horsemen carry out with aplomb at a frenetic pace and onthefly with less than halfadozen total team members empowered by an unlimited budget and a mystery benefactor.All the while apparently real traffic zooms along with presumably untrained and unprepared public going about normal business.We are expected to believe that the way Hollywood makes a highspeed accident occur without killing anybody can be done by a handful of highly motivated professional stage magicians read amateurs to road stunts and somehow this can be accomplished without completely controlled surroundings.This elaborately and improbably faked highspeed death scene is just one example of the film jumping into an explanation of how it really happened that seems less probable and less believable than anything you could have guessed before being told.And the plot problems go much deeper than buying into deathdefying scenes that require an elimination of anything random in a busy public space. I couldn't buy the ultimate reveal about the real identity and motives of the Mark Ruffalo character either. It seemed incongruous. It felt like a cheat. The way he is planted in relation to earlier events seems like an afterthought. And I couldn't buy that underneath his deliberate blundering and willful ignorance was someone not only much smarter than he appeared but someone so capable of perfect planning as to be damned near omniscient.The total impression is of a promising film idea that fell on its own very expensive sword. I don't know what happened but it looks like it got battered and morphed around and rewritten by multiple teams of writers. The total feeling is that the story got killed and Frankensteined back together multiple times. And it looks like the final edit came after the director and all concerned were out of steam and over budget. I felt intellectually raped to put it bluntly. I felt like the director was content to dazzle us with action and effects and to take our money while demanding our total credulity on the plot points using the angle provided by magic in a rather disingenuous way.This instead of providing a coherent narrative that would allow an adult audience to cheerfully maintain a willing suspension of disbelief. The storyline turns into a madhouse of improbabilities and then rationalizes its real business like a pathological liar. What a travesty to the promising themes of magic and old rivalries treated so well in other recent films. And what a waste of a beautiful allstar cast so entertaining as individuals in the early scenes.".

	onyx:emotionText "Now You See Me has a stellar cast a fun and intriguing premise and themes showdown of rival magicians combined with a heist delightful smartassery and cunning tactics  especially in those scenes dominated by Jesse Eisenberg or Woody Harrelson. Oh and it has quite dazzling action sequences. All the best parts of this film are wellpackaged and sold in the gripping theatrical trailer.I took someone I loved to Now You See Me and expected the payoff of a perfect night of entertainment.I'm not impossible to please at the movies and I actively wanted this to be a good time. I went out for entertainment and leisure and in good company and high spirits not at all for the purpose of writing a critical review.What's more I'm a big fan of all of the raw ingredients in this film. I enjoy magic and I could watch Morgan Freeman or Michael Caine in almost anything now proved. I fully enjoyed a much better film called The Prestige which might be regarded by some as a predecessor.But what happened here?After several fun scenes and a promising opening sequence that made me want to care about the characters I discovered a film in search of a plot and utterly lacking intellectual integrity and respect for the audience. The twists and reversals weren't just surprising they were completely unbelievable. You didn't see it coming but not because of skillful misdirection the art of magicians so often implied. Rather you didn't see it coming because the explanations were crooked and cooked up and merely expedient.Especially by late in the film when they start tracking backward to earlier events to show you how you were fooled and what was really going on the whole time  the explanations presented are less convincing than simply believing in real magic.!!!Spoler Alert Stop reading here if you would like to watch this movie without knowing anything about the late scenes reveals and reversals!!!For example the Four Horsemen stage the death of one of their own by perfectly orchestrating a highspeed traffic accident on a crowded bridge. It's imperative that the car he's apparently driving flips and tumbles several times and ultimately bursts into flames. But it's equally imperative that the pursuing detective can retrieve a stack of papers from the wrecked car. He must be able to retrieve the papers but not the body all while getting away with his own life or else the plot begins to unravel. The timing is of course worked out impeccably and it's carried out with no other fatalities on the bridge. And somehow the magicians have stuffed a replacement body from the morgue into an identical car just before turning it into a timebomb. The audience knows emotionally that the Dave Franco character shouldn't really be dead as I heard one person exclaim loudly during the closing sequence when Jack Wilder shows up again but the way his death is apparently faked would defy an unlimited budget and dozens of trained stunt drivers and coordinators  unless of course you close the bridge to public traffic.

The fbi guy did he base his whole career on this single moment? That is determenation and planning out of this world. But I guess its a whole lot easier to say its just distraction and magic that did it all.

Flashy loud with bells and whistles and big personalities an exciting premise... illusionists rob banks using supposed magic but the four horsemen are just puppets in a game but the hype is more than the substance of the film itself.You'd expect suspense twists intelligent plot misdirection and all sorts of thrilling viewing? No. This film tries to be a lot more intelligent than it actually is. Like Atlas Eisenberg says Always be the most intelligent person in the room or something similar this film thinks it is being intelligent but actually it's not challenging enough. It gives too much away isn't as unpredictable as it should be really you couldn't see that ending coming? and just isn't as clever as it promises. The tricks I really wanted explaining weren't... the ones that were more obvious were explained. The ending actually isn't a denouement as it's been laying clues all along  and anyone who's seen a lot of films can see the twists coming a mile away. I focus on the twists and reveal because as a heist movie the end is the big reveal. But unlike Oceans Eleven for example it has more or less handed it to you on a plate already.The actors were good. Morgan Freeman and Woody Harrelson stealing the show of course with Dave Franco doing a bang up job with some incredible physical acting stunts and so forth. I'm afraid Jesse Eisenberg didn't convince in his character and was annoying after a while Franco rather underutilised really. Isla Fisher was good but clearly the glamour rather than a serious character which was a shame as she was good.This was supposed to be a big blockbuster film big back drops epic stunts and huge crowd scenes but it failed to deliver. As heistmagic genre films go it's not that great and The Prestige was far more cerebral and gripping. Entertaining to a point but I got a bit bored and some of the scenes were too long  chases etc. If you are a fan of heist films or magic you'll enjoy it or are a fan of particular actors or will just enjoy it for what it is and don't want to be challenged intellectually it's a great film. I think Hollywood endings are just too commonplace. 610 for me.".

A movie review show said this was less than impressive and the writeups in print were lukewarm but when the missus said lets go watch a movie I wanted to give it a try because the cast was impressive and come on who doesn't like magic tricks???? Let's begin with the positives. It runs for 115 minutes which compared to The Long Ranger and anything Peter Jackson hands in is almost preview length so that was good. Unless the result of decent editing is a lack of character depth then perhaps it wasn't.... but we'll get to that shortly.The cast were good.

Whilst I liked the actors I don't like any of the characters... actually that's unfair I don't dislike them I just don't know them. The film makers spent ten seconds giving us a back story for the main protagonists therefore giving me no cause to support their scheme. BUT THEY WERE RIGHTING A WRONG FROM A LONG TIME AGO I hear you scream!!! And this is true but we're not meant to know this until the final reveal......unless you worked it out as soon as Morgan Freeman mentioned it in which case the whole movie failed as a mystery and you were left to decide whether to finish your coke before your popcorn or keep a little to wash out those annoying bits that get stuck between your teeth....but I digress.I had also hoped to enjoy some magic tricks but these were all achieved with CGI so like Star Wars III  III I'm left wishing the director refused to take the easy way out of disguising a less than competent script with colour and movement.A couple of quick lessons from this film. One when you pretend to kill off a character in a car accident get at least one of their friends to look like they're upset distressed or just annoyed that they have to feed their cat while they're in hiding. No one cared when the young bloke was blown up in the car crash so we knew he had to turn up again.The second suggestion is to paraphrase Mr Eisenberg's line during questioning the first rule of movie making is don't try to be smartest person in the room if you're not. It just turns into a shallow mess.I also read with some interest that the film makers were working on a sequel which unless it's just the director and writers apologising for this effort then I won't be attending.

Each of the four magicians is drafted in for their individual talents however these aren't really highlighted or explored during the film in any detail. In fact there is no character development at all which is more disappointing given the fact that the cast includes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman among others. So a few minutes in and they perform their robbing a bank trick the FBI man and the Interpol girl who are somehow teamed up are flummoxed so they take the magicians in for questioning. This doesn't go well for the FBI as the magicians use their mindcard tricks to outwit them and in the end they are let go. So the FBI calls in the help of Morgan Freeman whose job is working out and explaining how tricks are done to help. He has clearly seen this all before and explains the bank robbery within seconds. This is where i kind of lost interest in the film. Anyway there are some attempts at this stage to add some depth to the movie but these all fail. The confrontations between Caine and Freeman are tired and they both just seem to be going through the motions. The love interest between the FBI man and the Interpol girl is forced and comes from nowhere. Basically she is hot and they are working on a case together so they fall in love. Even the main four cast members have no chemistry or likability. So moving on a couple more tricks are performed and the cat and mouse game with the FBI continues. I wont ruin the disappointing end but let's just say there are a few twists that anyone who has seen a movie before would have worked out by now and then the film ends. All in all the worst film I've seen in a long time and shame on Woody Harrelson for following his excellent performance in Seven Psychopaths with this garbage.".

Much of the story and the tricks are based upon screwing the one percent. If you aren't a Wall Street occupier or are greater than 12 years old I recommend skipping it. Come to think of it it's too violent for viewers 12 or less.";

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing the trailers for this and I thought it really looked great. Reading some of the reviews on here many of them claim that people with a low IQ dislike the film. Well I don't mean to toot my own horn but I don't think I'm a stupid individual and I've seen thousands of movies...more than your average joe because I love movies. However this was a stone cold dud. Decent cast some real twists and turns but a blatantly complicated plot line that makes little sense and tries way too hard just to be complex. A truly smart film can be smart and tricky without trying SO hard. Now You See Me just throws in all kinds of tricks and twists without any build up or thinking about whether or not it makes sense. It was a very interesting experience when the big final twist of the movie was revealed and everyone in the theatre I was in gasped and then that was immediately followed by many people whispering That's dumb That doesn't make sense. They are exactly right. The big twist has no groundwork laid for it and makes no sense at all but by that time you are so completely lost in the silly story that you won't care that it doesn't make sense.The cast certainly is not the issue for this film. The cast is actually pretty good. I'm just surprised they actually signed on to this but then again it is making okay money at the box office. I didn't much care for Jesse Eisenberg's character. That's not to say he didn't do a good job I just didn't like him much. His character is smug and egotistical but fits the role nicely and carries the cast well. I thought Woody Harrelson was excellent in his role as a mentalist that can hypnotize. He was probably my favourite character and yet there wasn't a lot done with him which is unfortunate. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco I lump together because while they were good they were mostly underused and sort of the sidekicks to Eisenberg and Harrelson most of the time. I think if I was making a film like this I would ensure the four of them share an equal amount of screen time and have strong characters. But they do well. Mark Ruffalo is the FBI agent trying to get to the bottom of the group of thieves. Ruffalo is good shows lots of intensity and the appropriate amount of angst for cop vs robbers. Unfortunately for her I thought Mlanie Laurent was very near pointless. I suppose she was there to give the audience yet another possible suspect and also to give Ruffalo a romance but both those angles were completely unnecessary and her monotone line delivery was enough to put you to sleep. Finally we have two legends Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. The best scenes in this movie easily are the ones with just the two of them on screen because their chemistry and on screen charisma is enough to carry any scene. However they are definitely blatantly used for their name power and the weak script does nothing for them.Given director Louis Leterrier is a talented director I'm surprised at really how bad the film was shot. Were there some nicely shot scenes? Yes there was but few and far between. I have actually seen all of Leterrier's films and this was by far the worst of them. I will give props to them in the opening scene when they play a magic trick that actually worked on me...they picked the car that I picked...I wonder if it works on everyone? After that the film falls into a complex web of lies and deceit and completely silly twists and turns that make little to no sense. Perhaps there are two many hands in the pot. There are no less than five screenwriters and story artists on the film. Its hard enough to find two writers that can jive and work together let alone five. Basically Now You See Me was a huge disappointment for me. In a summer of blockbusters you need something better than this. 410".

You hardly get any background info about them and what drives them to do what they do. The makers try to add romance action suspense drama and all of it fails. It went to the point where you just wait for the movie to end. Lots of good actors and all of them have been made to play cartoonish roles in a movie that takes itself quite seriously. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The street tricks on TV are way more fun and enjoyable. At least there you know the magicianillusionisttrickster is doing it to entertain or make a name for himself and a quick buck unlike this movie which tries to show them off with personalities like superheroes.

It was wooden inauthentic and the sort of dialogue that was so obvious that a child could figure it out from the context in the film. If they needed to say have the dialogue that was being said in this film weeeeeellll you're doing it wrong. Subtext anyone?Characterisation Again really lazy. Every single character in the film was one dimensional with not even a HINT of a human variability or individuality. If some is a 'baddie' all he does is bad things. The 'romantic interest' runs around after our protagonist lovingly. The Four Horsemen magicians also I couldn't have cared less for. Worse still I didn't care about a single thing any of them did.Plot I thought about this on the way to my car after leaving. Few major flaws. One there was no tension at all for pretty much all of the film. You had the Four Horsemen magicians running about like Robin Hood and you were kinda rooting for them somewhat. Then two you had Ruffalo and the French lady running around trying to catch them who you were also kind of behind too. There was only one real 'baddie' in Michael Caine but he was a cursory villain and not the main event really. Ruffalo's 'revenge' against the safe maker whose faulty safe killed his father was pulled out of nowhere. Even at the end there was no alteration in the states of our characters. The good guys stayed good just like they'd been at the start why did I watch this film again?. Cinematography This wasn't as bad the elements above but there was definitely a spot when Ruffalo was in New Orleans standing street level among cars when I probably physically squinted and thought 'sweet lord what is this film trying to do to me?'.Overall I'd say avoid this film. Weak writing weak performances from great actors who i don't blame pointless plot. Worst film I've seen in a while. Sorry ".

Is Now You See Me as successful as the aforementioned films? Not necessarily but it's a fun movie that deconstructs the acts of modern magicians.The story follows four Vegas magicians known as the Four Horsemen who rob a bank in the middle of one of their shows. What follows is a catandmouse thriller where the FBI chases after these magicians always one step behind trying to figure out how they did it.Where Now You See Me works best is when Leterrier creates cinematic sequences showing us how these magicians used reallife magic tricks to befuddle and dupe both their victims and the FBI. As well if you want a film with twists and turns this one will not disappoint. While most of the major twists can be found out before revealed there is still a joy in watching those twists unfold thanks to Leterrier's Sherlock Holmes' style of visual deduction. However the script often falters in one of the most crucial areas that of character.Leterrier and company are constantly trying to balance the breakneck pace with the large cast of characters and it just leaves the characters hanging out to dry. Character development is sorely lacking in Now You See Me to where I never really cared about any of the characters. Part of this is because the film is constantly shifting points of view. The first thirty minutes follow our Robin Hoodlike magicians and then it switches to the FBI agents tracking them down but then the film has the magicians constantly one step in front of the FBI to the point that it makes the FBI often come across as buffoons and I find it hard to care for characters who are so easily fooled. Ultimately I feel that had the film focused entirely on one set of characters like the magicians or the FBI the film would have been stronger and been easier to find a focal point but as it is the film's core is often muddled.While Now You See Me may not be a grand slam it's still entertaining thanks to the thrills and visual style of the film. Bottom line if you're a fan of the heist genre you'll like this movie. For me though it just lacks a further script rewrite to have become one of the best examples of the genre.I give Now You See Me an 8 out of 10!".

There's nothing subtle about the tone of the movie. You're constantly reminded that there is a mysterious element that you are not seeing. And when it is finally revealed at the end there is hardly any surprise at all. Worst of all there are too many things that happen in the movie inexplicably. You find yourself waiting for information that never comes. Questions are posed that leave you wondering why something happened but then they're just abandoned and never reexamined. This movie made me angry. I felt like it was condescending to me the entire time. Fast talking quick witted characters using dialogue spoken so fast with convoluted vocabulary camera shots that were shaky and always moving. It was trying to confuse me with smoke and mirrors to make me think that it was exciting intriguing and thrilling but realistically it was not.".

When the director keeps showing me something and then saying that wasn't what happened it doesn't take long for me to stop caring about what just happened. The result is a film that's much too long and takes far too long to get to the point so that when the final twist did happen I just didn't care anymore.I was intrigued by the great trailer for this film but it oversells the actual film which was very disappointing.".

No weak points actingwise great job on casting.  It's fastpaced the action never hits any dull parts. And even the small romance scenes don't drag on long enough to take away from anything. You're pretty lockedin from start to finish.  Particularly great scenes between Eisenberg Ruffalo and Harrelson in the first half of the movie.  Great ending if you've been paying attention. Cons  You wish there was more dialog between Eisenberg and Harrelson.  The 2nd half of the movie might move a bit too fastagain pay attention.  Somebody thought this was a Marvel movie for like 5 seconds and had The Hulk fighting Gambitwaitis that a bad thing?...Overall this movie is a solid flick with some great actors that you shouldn't sleep on.

Disappointed ashamed repulsed and the feeling of blatantly being deceived. Can I get my money back please?";

I love the allusions to Mozart all throughout from the opening with Einstein playing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star on the violin to him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ testing of the Ed Walters.  I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career an especially unique situation for the 1950's the time in which this movie is set.  I myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children so please don't think I am some staunch women's libber. It's wonderful how a man who is only a grease monkey is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as Catherine's fiance a clinical behavioral researcher.  The message to me is that we are not what we do but who we are is defined by so much more  no labels.  There are so many little gags and oneliners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully.I did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene when Ed Walters is to speak at symposium there are 3 instruments protractor ruler etc. hanging on the right from the chalk ledge.  In the next camera shot there only 2.  In the credits on our video it lists Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters not Bob Rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on Imdb.I highly recommend this movie.  It may be a piece of fluff in some estimations but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. Not only that what a great cast is assembled here.  Watch it and enjoy!".

	schema:headline " You don't need a high I.Q to get this movie. It's pretty entertaining. It's a wunderkind.";
	schema:reviewBody "I.Q was the Big Bang Theory of the 1990's. This romantic comedy directed by Fred Schepisi is a very charming film. The film is about friendly garage mechanic Ed Walters Tim Robbins who is trying to impress a smart Princeton University mathematician Catherine Boyd Meg Ryan by acting a newly discovery genius with some help with Catherine's Uncle Albert Einstein Walter Matthau and his buddies fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht Joseph Maher Kurt Gdel Lou Jacobi and Boris Podolsky Gene Saks. The casting for Albert Einstein's friends almost were originally going to be Peter Ustinov Barry Humphries and John Cleese. No matter who was cast they see Edward as someone who would be better suited for Catherine rather than her stiff and fussy English fianc experimental psychology professor James Moreland Stephen Fry. Things get heat up when the science community heard about this 'wunderkind' genius work on Cold Fusion power rockets and seek Edward to help the American take back the space race from the Russians. I have to say everybody is just charming. Tim Robbins is a fine actor who is believable but he was a bit difficult during filming I heard. He said in the '90s nobody would like a character who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie. That's the whole premise of the film. In my opinion I didn't mind it but I think Tim Robbins was right because not a lot of people end up going to see this movie. Meg Ryan is a hot smart woman who looks wonderful in the poodle skirts. She looks really young in this role. Stephen Fry was pretty good and at less the filmmakers didn't make his character too unlikable. Last I have to say Walter Matthau fit the part. He did a great job to the point that it seem like Albert Einstein was playing himself. For dramatic reasons I.Q. fictionalizes the lives of certain real people. Albert Einstein did not have a niece by the name of Catherine Boyd. Kurt Gdel was famously shy and reclusive so he probably wouldn't be hanging out with Einstein and Boris Podolsky. I like how the movie didn't play it safe by over explaining the calculations of the physics theories. If you don't get the jokes. It's alright. I didn't get some of the things they were saying too. Plus I study physics before coming into this film. I love to do my research and I think I learn a lot from this film. I never heard of Hamiltonians iambic pentameter zeno paradox and others. The odd humor might leave some people scratching their heads but overall most of it was pretty simple to understand. The comedy works as well. I love the debate scene about if time exist or not. The whole I.Q test was funny but a bit unrealistic. The Spike Jones music scene was pretty odd. The Marlon Brando impression was great. By the way people the impression was from 1953's Wild Ones and 1954's On the Waterfront not 1972's the Godfather. I love the movie soundtrack very much from Jerry Goldsmith. The violin melody of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star was amazing to hear. Other songs heard was the Alphabet song and some classical music from Wolfgang Mozart and Joseph Haydn. Some critics didn't find the movie great because Einstein in their eyes seem too silly or dumb. I doubt Einstein was such a hard head scientist. Einstein reportedly was playful and fond of jokes that could be seen by some as childish but in the movie he was indeed sound smart with all the terminology. I love how they got away with the PG rating with all the sexual innuendos down speaks and euphemism. There was a lot of dark humor as well like example the man stuck in a box without a sense of time. Minus the historic accuracies this film is fun to watch. This romantic comedy is full of wahoo!".

	onyx:emotionText "I.Q was the Big Bang Theory of the 1990's. This romantic comedy directed by Fred Schepisi is a very charming film. The film is about friendly garage mechanic Ed Walters Tim Robbins who is trying to impress a smart Princeton University mathematician Catherine Boyd Meg Ryan by acting a newly discovery genius with some help with Catherine's Uncle Albert Einstein Walter Matthau and his buddies fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht Joseph Maher Kurt Gdel Lou Jacobi and Boris Podolsky Gene Saks. The casting for Albert Einstein's friends almost were originally going to be Peter Ustinov Barry Humphries and John Cleese. No matter who was cast they see Edward as someone who would be better suited for Catherine rather than her stiff and fussy English fianc experimental psychology professor James Moreland Stephen Fry. Things get heat up when the science community heard about this 'wunderkind' genius work on Cold Fusion power rockets and seek Edward to help the American take back the space race from the Russians. I have to say everybody is just charming. Tim Robbins is a fine actor who is believable but he was a bit difficult during filming I heard. He said in the '90s nobody would like a character who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie. That's the whole premise of the film. In my opinion I didn't mind it but I think Tim Robbins was right because not a lot of people end up going to see this movie. Meg Ryan is a hot smart woman who looks wonderful in the poodle skirts. She looks really young in this role. Stephen Fry was pretty good and at less the filmmakers didn't make his character too unlikable. Last I have to say Walter Matthau fit the part. He did a great job to the point that it seem like Albert Einstein was playing himself. For dramatic reasons I.Q. fictionalizes the lives of certain real people. Albert Einstein did not have a niece by the name of Catherine Boyd. Kurt Gdel was famously shy and reclusive so he probably wouldn't be hanging out with Einstein and Boris Podolsky. I like how the movie didn't play it safe by over explaining the calculations of the physics theories. If you don't get the jokes. It's alright. I didn't get some of the things they were saying too.

If I could fault the film for two reasons they would be a weak script and lack of chemistry between Tim Robbins and Meg Ryan. On the positive side Walter Matthau was perfectly cast as the elderly Einstein who became Ryan's guardian when his brother died. The scenery and evocation of small town 1950's New Jersey including numerous vintage cars of the era was very well done. I thought the motorcycle ride was one of the highlights of the film. Tim Robbins' character seems to change abruptly when he undergoes a fashion and hairstyle makeover. Whereas before this he was confident and assertive through the rest of the story he seems troubled jittery and low in selfesteem. Something about Meg Ryan's character bothered me and I never really bought into the notion that this intellectual would be seriously interested in Robbins. Also I think Einstein's three wacky buddies are in way too many scenes for the amount of corny humor they actually provide.

	schema:headline " Joseph GordonLevitt delivers a Stinging Critique of Modern Relationships";
	schema:reviewBody "Don Jon was very wellreceived in its regional premiere at the Paramount Theatre during Austin's SXSW Film Festival. The film was written directed and starred Joseph GordonLevitt. He did a really fine job for his writing and directorial debut but he may have been trying to do too much. The acting by GordonLevitt Scarlett Johansson Julianne Moore Tony Danza Glenne Headly and Brie Larson is quite good. I think it is GordonLevitt's script that leaves something to be desired. His character Jon is a very successful ladies' man who is also heavily addicted to masturbating to internet porn  numerous times daily. Many people will find the film to be quite funny and enjoyable. However the graphic use of porn will not be to everybody's taste and may be offputting to viewers  particularly female viewers. I'm also wondering whether the extensive use of porn will lead to the MPAA giving it the kissofdeath NC17 rather than an R rating.JGL's script is wellintentioned and he is trying to make the point that many people become so selfabsorbed that they lose the ability to interact with others on a human level. Jon is deadened to real romance by his reliance on porn. His girlfriend has an overly romanticized view of relationships based on watching too many romantic movies. They are both so selfabsorbed and selfish that they can't really build a real relationship. Still it was often difficult to figure out what JGL's point was and in many ways became clearer listening to him during the QA after the film. JGL is attempting to raise profound issues about human relationships in the modern era but he hasn't quite figured out how to do that as a writer and director.

	onyx:emotionText "Don Jon was very wellreceived in its regional premiere at the Paramount Theatre during Austin's SXSW Film Festival. The film was written directed and starred Joseph GordonLevitt. He did a really fine job for his writing and directorial debut but he may have been trying to do too much. The acting by GordonLevitt Scarlett Johansson Julianne Moore Tony Danza Glenne Headly and Brie Larson is quite good. I think it is GordonLevitt's script that leaves something to be desired. His character Jon is a very successful ladies' man who is also heavily addicted to masturbating to internet porn  numerous times daily. Many people will find the film to be quite funny and enjoyable. However the graphic use of porn will not be to everybody's taste and may be offputting to viewers  particularly female viewers. I'm also wondering whether the extensive use of porn will lead to the MPAA giving it the kissofdeath NC17 rather than an R rating.JGL's script is wellintentioned and he is trying to make the point that many people become so selfabsorbed that they lose the ability to interact with others on a human level. Jon is deadened to real romance by his reliance on porn. His girlfriend has an overly romanticized view of relationships based on watching too many romantic movies. They are both so selfabsorbed and selfish that they can't really build a real relationship. Still it was often difficult to figure out what JGL's point was and in many ways became clearer listening to him during the QA after the film. JGL is attempting to raise profound issues about human relationships in the modern era but he hasn't quite figured out how to do that as a writer and director. I expect that he is going to become as fine a director and writer as he already is an actor. He has a fine future ahead of him.";

Sort of like 500 Days of Summer on steroids. No pun intended. In fact it may be even safe to say that Don Jon is the next chapter in the 500 Days saga albeit with a different character. Perhaps one made cynical by the events of JGL last romance comedy outing.Don Jon has graduated beyond puppy love certainly and onto full blown adult fun. But the movie is very biting and sort of tears apart his selfserving agenda.A lot of people seem to be caught up in the porn aspect of the movie but honestly the porn is a metaphor no more important to the gymtanlaundrysexualized commercials.There are only two real female characters in the film Esther and Jon's quietexceptforonepowerfulline sister. The sister in fact almost makes the movie as they use her small character to incredible effect.The movie does a nice job of tricking the audience into rooting for Jon and Barbara of course it's all a ploy. They even set up Esther as a sort of antagonist. She is enticing yet feels all wrong for Jon. Older sort of run down maybe a bit of a predator of weak men the movie isn't very clear about her at the start. She runs completely counter to the stereotypes of women as set up by the film. She is far from perfect but Moore makes her believably beautiful. I truly doubt many other actresses could've sold this role in the way she did. While her age played right into the character she probably was right for the character for mostly other reasons.I don't think the movie is overall that outstanding. Many of the jokes fall flat and some of it is tedious. In fact the vast majority of it could be considered filler but the end is so incredible it does a great job of tying all these scenes together in a way that makes perfect sense and delivers a powerful message. Without completely ruining it the end embraces the typical clich but flips it on it's head. What results is a very mature version of what audiences have come to expect from these types of movies. The same but also very different.I would expect JGL will have continued success as a Director and actor.The guy truly gets it.".

It isn't really a guy film even though technically it tries to look at sex from a guy's perspective. It may actually best be called a chick flick but one they would see alone rather than with a date. At the screening I saw ALL the raucous laughter was coming from very obviously female voices  falling out of their chairs laughing over what they viewed as stereotypical male behavior  and even as the supposed 10 played by Scarlett Johansson reveals herself to be the kind of demanding insert the word for a female canine here who a very stupid  make that excessively immature  straight boy like the one played with supreme lan by authordirector GordonLevitt would make a fool of himself over! The film heavily satirizes stereotypical straight New Jersey Catholics  the easily offended of which should probably stay away along with anyone who expects a slick date night romantic comedy that doesn't require them to THINK  but it IS a beautifully structured and polished first directorial effort and very funny in its way. Man or woman though it is not your usual DATE film to see with the opposite sex. The litmus scene for the film was probably when Johansson Barbara confronts GordonLevitt Jon over watching porn! Foolishly trying to evoke simple reason he accurately tells her that EVERY guy watches porn  and that anyone who says he doesn't is lying. The theatre got absolutely quiet there for a moment in any section where dates were sitting as each side wondered what the other was thinking. What YOU may think in that scene will determine a lot about how you view and react to the film. You may enjoy it regardless of what you think of that for the film core issue but you sure won't want to see it with anyone who you can't comfortably talk about it with.The home scenes with Jon's family and Barbara's are probably excess baggage but they give the central characters broad context the broadest performance in a very stylized film is probably Tony Danza's performance as Jon's father  and set up the one totally human moment in the film when Jon's silent sister defines what a good sibling should be when she finally has a line! Ultimately there is one unexpected rational woman Julianne Moore giving a remarkable imitation of Susan Sarandon! who Jon meets in the night class Barbara insists he take who not only gets him but broadens his horizons for the kind of growth any central character in a good film must have.Don't expect a pat happy ending or a cheap thoughtfree throw away comedy and DON'T make it first date material with someone you don't know yet! and the open minded will have a wonderful time. My takeaway image is really of a few years ago at the first Broadway preview of a Tony winning musical called AVENUE Q. Just before it started a student of mine at the university where I teach came over to introduce his mother who was seeing the show too sitting in front of each other all the way over at the side. Midway through the show there was a very funny very outrageous musical number called You Can Be As Loud As You Want When You're making Love. I glanced over to see how my student and his mother were taking it and as you can imagine my student sitting in front of his mother was sinking onto the floor with embarrassment. What he couldn't see was his mother rocking with laughter both at the insouciance of the number and her son's embarrassment! I think my mother who as far as I know probably doesn't approve of pornography or my minister would be howling with laughter at DON JON too  but they probably wouldn't want anyone they knew to see them doing so.Recommended  but with noted reservations.".

Don Jon is also like Blier's film in the sense that Jon finds his 10 yet he's still unsatisfied. Both films are very different in tone aesthetics and geography but they delicately touch in the realm of our own emotional misconceptions and immaturity.

Levitt sharply illustrates this issue by way of porn addiction it might be crude for some but he manages not to fall into excessive vulgarity or toilet humor.Also featuring the always wonderful Julianne Moore in an important role plus Glenne Headly I've missed her on the big screen Tony Danza and Brie Larson as Jon's parents and sister respectively Don Jon is worth the visit.

The former child star has turned into quite the upandcoming young actor as he's worked to rebrand himself as something more than that kid from 3rd Rock From the Sun. Over the years he's starred in such films as Brick The Dark Knight Rises and Looper and has proved to be the type of actor whom everyone loves  and who actually deserves that love. However his most impressive performance to date might just be the one he gave behind the camera with Don Jon.The film marks Levitt's first time writing and directing a feature length film and it makes one hell of an impression especially because he tackles the lead role as well. Don Jon is one of those movies that has plenty of laughs and a few heartfelt moments and it's certainly entertaining. But it also touches on a few interesting social issues. I think I'll just go ahead and say it but Joseph GordonLevitt gives away a few trade secrets much to the horror of men everywhere Don Jon touches on that dreadfully embarrassing fact that every guy is terrified will come out. What secret is that? Well it's probably best to put it in the words of the protagonist Jon himself Every guy looks at porn every day.Well that last part might be a bit of an exaggeration but Don Jon does bring up the point that pornography has become so readily available through the internet and even television that it's just simply within arm's reach at every single second of every single day and every guy now and then reaches out to take a handful. However society still treats it as something shameful and embarrassing rather than a fact of life.Don Jon doesn't treat the use of pornography as something that should destroy relationships or cause significant others to fly off the handle in fits of jealousy. In fact the movie seems to indicate it's a habit that's probably pretty healthy. That isn't to say that Jon has a healthy habit as he's reduced to having to look at pornography constantly throughout the day even after sex but you know that's an extreme example.Then again maybe it isn't. Maybe the film offers a bit of a warning about how a little pornography is perfectly normal but a lot can create a monster. Too much porn can make it so that it's nearly impossible to connect with someone else on a meaningful level. After all watching too much sex can create expectations that are as unrealistic as the ones the romantic comedies create.What really impressed me about Don Jon though are the performances that Levitt pulls out of his costars. I've honestly never seen Scarlett Johansson give a better performance than she did as Jon's trashy New Jersey girlfriend Barbra. She's absolutely despicable as she slowly begin to reveal her true intentions and tries to paint Jon as the bad guy when she discovers his addiction. On top of that Tony Danza gives a sidesplitting performance as Jon's hotheaded father who gets into dickmeasuring contest with his son every Sunday night figurative people come on.However the most impressive of them all is Levitt himself who has repeatedly proved that he is one hell of an actor and one who has earned my trust as a moviegoer. The role is something so far from what I would have ever pictured him portraying but he pulls it off beautifully as he plays the scumbag goodguy stereotype.Now for the hard part. I really enjoyed Don Jon. It strikes as a solid balance between art and entertainment it's filled with lots of laughs and it touches on a sensitive topic in a way that doesn't seem preachy. The ending is a little weak but everything up until that is golden. However I'm not sure if it's what one would call a date movie since it will probably lead to inquisitive stares during a quiet car ride home afterward. And honestly that's really too bad. For the people that are willing to embrace the fact that everyone looks at porn this movie is well worth the price of admission. However I'm not sure if most of its value comes from the first viewing. It's no Shame but there's really no shame in that.".

	schema:reviewBody "New Jersey guy Jon Joseph GordonLevitt only cares about a few things in his life his family friends church and porn. After many onenightstands he finally decides to settle down with a dime named Barbara Scarlett Johansson. But not even this relationship can compare to the happiness Jon has when alone with his pornography. When he realizes his porn may be too influential on him he begins to change his lifestyle and beliefs with help from an older woman Julianne Moore.Stories of sex addiction aren't new having been dealt with most recently in 2011's Shame but Don Jon feels different. Jon loves porn he says it many times in voiceover and is consistently shown getting up in the middle of the night to go watch porn after just having sex in real life. He doesn't see it as an addiction saying It's porn. It's not heroin as his excuse. To show the media influence on sex the film opens by crosscutting many sexualized commercials film scenes and television clips over the credits while actual pornography clips are spliced throughout. But unlike Shame which treats this topic in an intense dramatic way Jon keeps it light funny and tries to show how easy it is for someone to unknowingly fall into this addiction in today's sex obsessed culture.The film also tackles an exploration of today's relationships. Barbara's own porn is romantic Hollywood films that Jon hates. These films have influenced Barbara's ideas on dating she yells at him to stop cleaning his apartment because it's not sexy and enforced her beliefs that typical gender roles are the only means to a happy relationship. This film speaks truths about ideas young people may have about dating in today's culture and while spinning these topics in a mostly comedic light it is still interesting to consider how much media pertains to our understanding of the world.Don Jon succeeds in most areas and one large part is due to its cast. Tony Danza is really funny as Jon's father and Scarlett Johansson and her hilarious Jersey accent steals every scene she in. The film offers up a good amount of laughs and the purposeful repetitive narrative works in showing Jon's changing lifestyle. Most of the film is so upbeat and fast that the last twenty minutes may feel like its dragging but it can be considered necessary due to Jon's sloweddown new lifestyle.The fact that this is the first film by writerdirector GordonLevitt is extremely impressive. Don Jon flies at a mostly fast pace has a fun cast and gives a great commentary on sex relationships and addiction.".

If you offend easy then avoid this. Also the first five minutes are the raunchiest in terms of dialog so if you can make it past that you should be OK. As far as the movie goes I did enjoy it but the thing about this movie is the abundance of sex and porn will distract from the true meaning of the movie. The movie isn't necessarily about addiction but more about watching a man trying to connect with a human in a way he never has before. There are some very funny scenes in this one but it does have a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch. Acting is great but all of this won't be given a fair chance because of the in your face porn aspect. That is a shame.

	schema:reviewBody "Don Jon 2013  12 out of 4Joseph GordonLevitt wrote director and stars as Jon a twentysomething man who loves women but what he loves even more is watching porn. He meets Barbara Scarlett Johansson who demands that he gives it up for her. DON JON isn't the greatest film ever made but I will say that I don't recall ever watching a movie that was so confident. Confidence is something most people lack and even most brass movies lack it but DON JON certainly isn't afraid to say what it wants to and stick by it. Having a romantic comedy that says watching porn is better than being with women and then tells you why that's the case is something incredibly rare. What's even rarer is that this type of subject is usually just played for cheap laughs but here there's a complete story wrapped around it that asks a lot of questions gives a lot of answers and as I said is 100 confident about itself. The confidence just really jumps off the screen unlike any movie I've ever seen and that's where the original aspect of this film comes. There have been countless movies that downplay women but this one here just does so in such a fresh and original way that you can't help but enjoy it. It also is very smart about guys their mentality on sex and various other issues. GordonLevitt does a wonderful job all around but especially in the acting department. As the writer he certainly knows this character very well but it still takes a very strong performance to get that to the screen and the actor does a fabulous job. Johansson also turns in her greatest work outside of a Woody Allen picture and Tony Danza is very memorable in his supporting bit as is Glenne Headly and Julianne Moore. The screenplay is certainly dirty and covers a lot of topics but the film never crosses the offensive line. The main reason it doesn't cross the line is that it remains smart no matter what it's saying and how dirty it's being said. DON JON is certainly a refreshing film that should get one excited thinking that GordonLevitt could turn into someone to keep your eye on not just as an actor but as a writer and director.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first half hour of this film makes you feel quite uncomfortable I saw a prescreening with my girlfriend and It made me feel a little tense as I wasn't able to gauge how she was perceiving what she was watching.There are a lot of sexually orientated scenes cut scenes from porn movies scenes of our protagonist Jon getting off with a hell of a lot of women. Scarlett Johansson's arrival doesn't slow any of this down despite her being cast in the archetypical female role. That being the girl Jon is going to give up his wicked ways for. I won't spoil how this ultimately pans out. Around this point the humour kicks in and I must say there are quite a few laugh out loud scenes. Jon's relationship with his family in particular and just his strange character in general provide a good comedic vibe. This film will not be for everybody. Those faint hearted souls who wont be able to stand anything more offensive than the solitary use of the F word well you guys should certainly pass this by. Overall the F word is used in excess of 120 times in this picture for starters. For me as the film plays out the sexual cut scenes begin to have more substance. They start to mean more than just the showing of perverse acts I believe what JGL was trying to show was an insight into how modern day men perceive women and relationships. How expectations are raised by pornography and advertising to create an image that will never be fulfilled in normal life. In some ways the film ends a bit of a damp squib despite being an enjoyable ride there is somehow a lack of conviction in the ending. Our 'hero' does see the error of his ways but it could have been done more convincingly in my opinion. All in all though this is a solid directorial debut from JGL there seems to be a real pace about the film from beginning to end. The way the dialogue is delivered and the temperament of the characters keeps things running steady and keeps you hooked.Definite recommendation from me.".

	schema:headline " Don Jon";
	schema:reviewBody "Don Jon was a film that I had to be a little patient with. What first started as a vulgar raucous and teen oriented film having little more than jokes involving perverseness and sexual humour and was something that I figured I had wasted my money on turned out to completely surprise me and ended up as one of my favourite films of this year. Yes the film does have a lot of sexual humour and content in it but it has some reason to seeing as the film is dealing with addiction to pornography. And what may have seemed immature and like teenage humour for the first little bit of the film soon went away and it became one of the most insightful and intelligent films of the year. I have heard the comparisons to this film from 2011's Steve McQueen directed film Shame which is also about sexual addiction. Unfortunately I have not seen Shame yet. I missed it at theatres and every time I go to the library to rent it it is out so for obvious reasons I can not compare the two of them. Don Jon did have a lot to say both about young men and women sex and relationships. It's the kind of film you would almost want younger teens to see in order to learn something and perhaps plan their own lives and future relationships a little more differently. Here the internet pornography sites serve as a form of escape for this main character and while he likes being around women he can not connect with them in the same way as he feels he can with things he sees on the computer. This further complicates things for himself because what we see on the internet and in magazines often times are things that are made to look perfect beautiful and however you want to put it but other than just looking at it there is no real connection or relationship to it. It is hollow and empty and void of any emotional connection or feelings to another person. Perhaps that is why this character can not relate to real women. Everything up to now has been completely empty and void of any feeling or connection and in his mind if he doesn't have to attach himself in any way to a real woman he wonders what the point of that is. Throughout the course of the film our lead character Jon meets two very different women who will both change his outlook and outcome of his way of handling relationships and finding truer meaning to both himself and others as well. The film while crude and a little graphic at times is far more into psychological and character study than one may think and it is one of the most insightful and accurate looks at young or basically any type of relationships that I have seen in a long time. Jon is with one woman who seems to be his dream woman but right from the start we do not really like her or at least I didn't. She herself had an unrealistic view of relationships that was more about status symbols and image than about real love for one another as well. The other woman we meet knows more about relationships and more about Jon himself than he may want to admit or care for her to know but there is a whole different type of connection and intimacy level there. The film shows that so often young men treat women as sexual objects and fantasies and actually how we can be so demeaning and almost sexist towards them. At the same time this selfish attitude hurts other people and ourselves because we can not truly ever find anything that is real if we continue on this way because everything has to be perfect or just like it is on movies magazines or the internet and it gives us a false distortion of reality relationships and other people. The film is the first film written and directed by actor Joseph GordonLevitt whose acting has impressed me over the years especially in films like Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin. Now he shows that he can not only act but write and direct as well. The film has moments of laugh out loud humour but it also has a tender and emotional side to it as well. It examines these people and what is really behind them and the hurts or the things they have been through and it is honest both about men women and relationships in general. As the film ended I could totally understand the way the film ended and why Levitt decided to do it in that way. It felt realistic for his character but at the same time also connected to beauty and happiness. I enjoyed the screenplay and direction immensely as well as the performances were all quite good as well. I liked the quick jump cut editing and the film's use of music in certain scenes I felt worked really well also. I know some viewers will be turned off by the material and subject matter but it really is a film worth seeing if you are in a relationship or even if you are not and this is a film that definitely has something to say. I look forward to future writing and directing projects for Levitt and as it stands Don Jon is one of 2013's best and maybe most misunderstood films as well.".

The film while crude and a little graphic at times is far more into psychological and character study than one may think and it is one of the most insightful and accurate looks at young or basically any type of relationships that I have seen in a long time. Jon is with one woman who seems to be his dream woman but right from the start we do not really like her or at least I didn't. She herself had an unrealistic view of relationships that was more about status symbols and image than about real love for one another as well. The other woman we meet knows more about relationships and more about Jon himself than he may want to admit or care for her to know but there is a whole different type of connection and intimacy level there. The film shows that so often young men treat women as sexual objects and fantasies and actually how we can be so demeaning and almost sexist towards them. At the same time this selfish attitude hurts other people and ourselves because we can not truly ever find anything that is real if we continue on this way because everything has to be perfect or just like it is on movies magazines or the internet and it gives us a false distortion of reality relationships and other people. The film is the first film written and directed by actor Joseph GordonLevitt whose acting has impressed me over the years especially in films like Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin. Now he shows that he can not only act but write and direct as well. The film has moments of laugh out loud humour but it also has a tender and emotional side to it as well. It examines these people and what is really behind them and the hurts or the things they have been through and it is honest both about men women and relationships in general. As the film ended I could totally understand the way the film ended and why Levitt decided to do it in that way. It felt realistic for his character but at the same time also connected to beauty and happiness. I enjoyed the screenplay and direction immensely as well as the performances were all quite good as well. I liked the quick jump cut editing and the film's use of music in certain scenes I felt worked really well also. I know some viewers will be turned off by the material and subject matter but it really is a film worth seeing if you are in a relationship or even if you are not and this is a film that definitely has something to say. I look forward to future writing and directing projects for Levitt and as it stands Don Jon is one of 2013's best and maybe most misunderstood films as well.";

But it can be more serious than that. And Don Jon proves that in a very comical way. Where Michael Fassbender went on and played it like a drama equally good at least in Shame this movie is lighter in tone most of the time. Still having drama to sit through but the comic moments make this an easier film to watch. If you don't mind the sexual theme it has you will get a powerful movie about the Downfalls of addiction".

A very talented actress for her young age and she is simply stunning never noticed her great body until this movie!.Overall a very entertaining film with few flaws that I enjoyed very much and it also tickled my 'gray matter' making me think about my own situation.I was a singer for most of my younger life age 18 to 35 or so having lots of casual sexonenight stands mostly with equally shallow sex bombs that only wanted onenight stands with the frontperson of the band but never met the 'woman of my life' longest lasting relationship with a woman lasted about 2 years and I feel something is definitely missing from my life now that I have a 'regular job' and have settled down.

He was a captain of a large ship while she was a maid on that ship so I realize I still have time to form a family but that time is running out... Time to do something about it!

We all know him for his stellar performances as an actor in movies such as Mysterious Skin and Looper as well as the Nolan masterpieces Inception and The Dark Knight Rises. he has a great career going on there as he has repeatedly proved to be one of Hollywood's most versatile performers  he can play the villain he can play the mastermind he can play the sweetheart here he has chosen to mime a dumb incredibly superficial Don Juan of the 21st century. The main character Jon is certainly not on the bright side. he keeps his life restricted to the same patterns and the same schedule as ever working as a bartender hitting on attractive women and getting them to bed working out at the gym going to church and confessing his sins and watching a lot of internet porn. It is the lastmentioned occupation that this movie revolves around which is kind of revolutionary in itself. How do you make a movie about a topic as sordid and yet ordinary as internet porn? You have to give it to JGL  he had had an idea there and explored it thoroughly to come up with a film that investigates the consequences of excessive porn consumption. For Jon it has become unquestioned everyday routine to raid the internet for porn whenever he feels the need. Thus he jerks off multiple times every day and even does it after he banged a hot girl. When he gets emotionally involved with particularly attractive Barbara played by Scarlet Johansson he is  for the first time  confronted with the idea that his porn addiction might be something bad. But not only Jon clings to stereotypical images his girlfriend has a hard time challenging her own romantic ideals which are basically epitomized by corny Hollywood tearjerkers. This is a clever arrangement by JGL which endows the movie with a depth and reflectiveness you would not expect from a comedy with this plot line. The logical synthesis that transforms Jon into a decent human is represented by Esther fabulously played by Juliane Moore. Jon comes across her during his evening courses at university and is clearly not interested at first because she is much older and probably not attractive enough for him. However the lady does not let go of him and tells him truths he cannot stand to hear . at first.After the first viewing one may not really appreciate the complexity that is underneath the surface. Initially the main characters Barbara and Jon embody clichs  he is the testosteronefilled alpha male who cannot bear criticism and she is the little princess who expects her boyfriend to do everything she wants. While Jon is gradually made to question his ideals Barbara is not. As a consequence Jon has changed at the end of the movie while Barbara hasn't. Another compliment to JGL for his unforced handling of a delicate topic. This is an actor who clearly does not shy away from sexual performances. He treats the topic in such an honest and relaxed way that the movie transports its message to all viewers. highly recommended.".

A dark man has been visiting them hurling religious epitaphs at them. Like a family house guest he doesn't want to leave and is even more bothersome than a Fuller Brush salesman or a religious solicitor. Does this strange figure intended to harm the Freelings or is he a person from the family's past?A scary sequel. Not bad if you want to follow the exploits of the Freelings then this movie is for you. Poltergeist II is a worthy sequel. I enjoyed it very much.

My favorite movie of all time is the original Poltergeist and this movie is a respectable sequel.  I like it because of the character Kane for one who gives the movie another ghostly dimension.  Julian Beck was wonderful in the film as Kane.  Also the children remained good actors especially the late Heather O'Rourke who played Carol Anne.  This is another strong performance by the young actress and would have gone on to be a wonderful adult actress later in life had she lived.  All in all I give it a 7.5 out of 10.".

Some of this movie's editing is really poor and it's a shame because the movie is actually pretty good and only really falls apart at the end when you can see how bad a hack job this movie really received.

	schema:headline " A relatively poor sequel that is void of tension and suspense";
	schema:reviewBody "The Freeling family has survived the intense ordeal of the supernatural from the first movie. They move into GrandmaJesshouse hoping to wipe the slate clean with everything and start fresh. When GrandmaJess abruptly passes away things begin to go downhill. Carol's abductor from the first movie shows up as a ghostly apparition Reverend Kane He's a religious nut that is responsible for many deaths. With the help of a mysterious Indian Shaman named Taylor Will Sampson The Freeling's are forced to battle evil once more. I saw this years ago and remember being thoroughly underwhelmed by it. It turns out that this was the case on my second viewing as well. The first movie wasn't perfect but it was an extremely well crafted film that knew how to entertain. Steven Spielberg's presence is sorely lacking in this one and everybody just seems to go through the motions. With all due respect to director Brian Gibson he doesn't have the flare or vision of Spielberg. Like a lot of sequels that are here to make cash it feels awfully contrived. The emotion I felt from the family is nowhere to be found in this movie. One of the reasons the first movie worked so well is the cohesiveness of the family. It felt genuine and I believed them. The cast tries their hardest in this movie to make it feel real but I wasn't buying into it this time. Spielberg is fantastic with family drama in his movies and Gibson isn't able to pull that off. We get some lame boo scares that pale in comparison to the first and there is no tension to be found. It lacks humor something the original did very well as well. I know those that are reading this may be getting annoyed at me comparing this sequel to the original with so many things but I can't help it. Any praise for this film? A few things. I did like the continuity from the first movie. The effects certainly hold up well. I won't spoil it but wait until you see the braces moment involving Robbie and the tequila worm. The acting is great definitely not their fault. JoBeth Williams is solid as the mother putting her all into the part. Craig Nelson is excellent too. I didn't like how his character shrugged everything off for a while. He was in no position to disbelieve things after the first movie didn't make much sense. I also felt they didn't go far enough with his possession storyline. That was really dark and had the ability to be something memorable. It's too bad it was so halfassed. Heather O'Rourke is one of the best child actors I've ever seen. She came through like a champ for her age. Zelda Rubenstein's presence wasn't needed in this movie. She gets on my nerves to begin with and her small part felt inconsequential. Julian Beck is one of the scariest horror villains in history. If this movie wasn't so disappointing I truly believe Julian would get the credit he deserves. You won't find many things creepier than Reverend Kane. Will Sampson is OK. Geraldine Fitzgerald has a mere cameo but added class to it. The storytelling is very jumbled at the end and left me feeling very confused at some of the events that transpired. This movie isn't horrible but it lacks the spectacle of the original. I haven't seen Poltergeist III in many years but I remember it being worse than this movie. This is worth a look if you've seen the first movie but you're better off sticking with the original. This movie had potential but failed to capitalize on it in a big way5.210".

However the first film wasn't all that great and this one isn't a complete washout either. The story is modified somewhat from the first episode so that now the source of the poltergeist unrest is attributed to the dead followers of a cult leader as opposed to the dead disturbed by unscrupulous property developers. The change has really only been made so that they can have a sequel to be perfectly honest however it does mean that the series is able to introduce the evil Reverend Kane. Kane is probably the best character in the series and his scene where he confronts the Freeling family on their front porch is the scariest and most wellcrafted moment in any of the films. Julien Beck is excellent and unforgettable as the skeletal preacher. The rest of the cast play it strictly by numbers although once again Heather O'Rourke is fab as the little girl. The other daughter is completely written out of this film with no explanation. Although it's a well documented fact that the actress who played her Dominique Dunne was murdered shortly after the first film was released I still don't think it would have trashed her memory to have explained her absence quite the opposite in fact.The Poltergeist series was perhaps most famous at the time for its spectacular visual effects and this film is no exception. The demon Kane is a well rendered creation and there are a number of cool 80's effects throughout. Unfortunately though it all ends in a somewhat underwhelming finale where the family enter some vortex or something. I think it would have been better if they had cut back on the specialeffects here and simply reintroduced Reverend Kane as he was much scarier. But I guess having a big effectsladen ending is one of the inbuilt rules of the Poltergeist movies sadly.Overall there's good stuff in this sequel but it's ultimately squandered on a rubbish ending.".

This movie is not real bad like most people say it is I did like some of it but it's not real good either. Poltergeist II takes place in Arizona which is where the Freeling family now resides. But no matter where you go you can't keep a nasty ghost down and those pesky spirits are back to terrorize the family once again. Where the first film was scary with a great sense of humor the second film comes off more funny than scary. Not a good sign for a horror film where you're expected to be scared. And there isn't much scares this time around. Plus the special effects this time around aren't as effective as they were in the first film. Nevertheless the effects received another Oscar nomination which to me was surprising. If there's anything to like about Poltergeist II it's the acting. JoBeth Williams Craig T. Nelson Heather O'Rourke Oliver Robins and Zelda Rubinstein are all back reprising their roles from the first film with a few new faces add to the cast. The new cast members add some spark here. Will Sampson is very good as the Indian medicine man who also happens to be an exorcist and comes in to help out the Freelings Julian Beck makes a strong presence as the evil preacher who happens to be the leader of the illmannered ghosts Beck was reportedly very ill when he made this and it shows on the screen he died right after filming completed and the great veteran actress Geraldine Fitzgerald has a nice small part as Grandma Freeling.

	schema:headline " Another Curiously Frustrating Horror Film Sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "JAWS 2 HALLOWEEN II THE RAGE CARRIE 2all of them horror film sequels that I can only label as curiously frustrating in that there's enough in them to like but just as much to be skittish about. This is also true of POLTERGEIST II THE OTHER SIDE the 1986 sequel to the highly acclaimed and highly successful 1982 Steven Spielberg coproducedcowritten horror film classic that Tobe Hooper of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE fame directed and which ranks with THE SHINING as one of the few true horror classics of the 1980s.The film picks up one year after the events of the original as the Frelengs led by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams have now moved off to a desert suburb of Phoenix Arizona while trying to get a new start living with Williams' mother Geraldine Fitzgerald. Nelson is having a rough go of it trying to be a vacuum salesman he had been in real estate but the Cuesta Verde incident left him out in the cold. When Fitzgerald passes on however it lets open the door for some literal ghosts of the Frelengs' past to haunt them. They become terrorized all over again and this time getting in contact with both the famous medium Tangina Barrons Zelda Rubinstein and an Indian Will Sampson well versed in the supernatural they figure out why. Back in the 19th century a group of White settlers were confronted by Indian warriors in what was to become the Cuesta Verde Estates resulting in a horrific Sand Creektype massacre that resulted in a mass graveyard that Nelson's former employers had built Cuesta Verde over. The spirits of those survivors including especially a deranged preacher named Kane Julian Beck have come back to snatch O'Rourke and to lead them to the Light because they are still not at rest but they seem to have no intention of bringing her back. Rubinstein and Sampson insist that the Frelengs must return to Cuesta Verde to confront Kane and his minions by entering the Other Side that netherworld between life and death that Williams and O'Rourke crossed in the original. In between though they are confronted with a whole host of horrific things including a Vomit Creature and a supernatural chainsaw that threatens to tear Nelson's station wagon apart as they head out for Cuesta Verde.Unlike a lot of horror films POLTERGEIST II maintains a good solid position of having five of the principals from the original film Dominique Dunne however had been killed in real life shortly after the original film had been released plus the solid special effects work of Richard Edlund who had worked on the original. What POLTERGEIST II lacks however is the effective and incisive direction of Hooper and both his and Spielberg's understanding of the genre and of family. Mark Victor and Michael Grais though they cowrote the original's screenplay with Spielberg somehow fail to grasp those concepts of the original and Gibson who directed the 1980 film BREAKING GLASS and later did 1993's WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is not really in Hooper's let alone Spielberg's league. The mayhem may very well have been accelerated from the original but that doesn't necessarily mean it's better.Two additions however do work quite well.

	onyx:emotionText "JAWS 2 HALLOWEEN II THE RAGE CARRIE 2all of them horror film sequels that I can only label as curiously frustrating in that there's enough in them to like but just as much to be skittish about. This is also true of POLTERGEIST II THE OTHER SIDE the 1986 sequel to the highly acclaimed and highly successful 1982 Steven Spielberg coproducedcowritten horror film classic that Tobe Hooper of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE fame directed and which ranks with THE SHINING as one of the few true horror classics of the 1980s.The film picks up one year after the events of the original as the Frelengs led by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams have now moved off to a desert suburb of Phoenix Arizona while trying to get a new start living with Williams' mother Geraldine Fitzgerald. Nelson is having a rough go of it trying to be a vacuum salesman he had been in real estate but the Cuesta Verde incident left him out in the cold. When Fitzgerald passes on however it lets open the door for some literal ghosts of the Frelengs' past to haunt them. They become terrorized all over again and this time getting in contact with both the famous medium Tangina Barrons Zelda Rubinstein and an Indian Will Sampson well versed in the supernatural they figure out why. Back in the 19th century a group of White settlers were confronted by Indian warriors in what was to become the Cuesta Verde Estates resulting in a horrific Sand Creektype massacre that resulted in a mass graveyard that Nelson's former employers had built Cuesta Verde over. The spirits of those survivors including especially a deranged preacher named Kane Julian Beck have come back to snatch O'Rourke and to lead them to the Light because they are still not at rest but they seem to have no intention of bringing her back. Rubinstein and Sampson insist that the Frelengs must return to Cuesta Verde to confront Kane and his minions by entering the Other Side that netherworld between life and death that Williams and O'Rourke crossed in the original. In between though they are confronted with a whole host of horrific things including a Vomit Creature and a supernatural chainsaw that threatens to tear Nelson's station wagon apart as they head out for Cuesta Verde.Unlike a lot of horror films POLTERGEIST II maintains a good solid position of having five of the principals from the original film Dominique Dunne however had been killed in real life shortly after the original film had been released plus the solid special effects work of Richard Edlund who had worked on the original. What POLTERGEIST II lacks however is the effective and incisive direction of Hooper and both his and Spielberg's understanding of the genre and of family. Mark Victor and Michael Grais though they cowrote the original's screenplay with Spielberg somehow fail to grasp those concepts of the original and Gibson who directed the 1980 film BREAKING GLASS and later did 1993's WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT is not really in Hooper's let alone Spielberg's league. The mayhem may very well have been accelerated from the original but that doesn't necessarily mean it's better.Two additions however do work quite well. Sampson a reallife Native American who starred in films like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES is extremely good as the Indian shaman who along with Rubinstein assists the Frelengs in their confrontation with the ghosts. And Beck is incredibly grisly and frightening as the deranged preacher out to permanently possess O'Rourke he comes off as a supernatural version of Robert Mitchum's role in the 1955 classic NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.The most welcome return on POLTERGEIST II besides Edlund's special effects is Jerry Goldsmith's intense orchestral score.

The rest of the family is back though headed up by stoner parents JoBeth Williams and Coach a.k.a Craig T. Nelson who is painfully bad in this who both have really bad hair.

The annoying Native American guy who sits around their backyard speaks in halfassed proverbs and does nothing for about an hour of screen time? Or the sillybeyondwords Reverend Kane who sings asinine bible songs at the top of his lungs? Who cares? You'll be too busy laughing at this film's unending parade of goofiness.The first movie was really good it held your attention had interesting effects and had some very scary eerie sequences. It wasn't perfect but it was an enjoyable movie. This flick is ridiculous. It has a few okay moments whenever the main monster shows up He first appears after Coach vomits him up!.  He's pretty cool looking but you don't get to see him much. The rest of the movie's effects sequences are completely preposterous. In one scene a kid is attacked by his own braces. Then Coach sits on a ghost. That's about it.Pointless scenes drag on filled with boring dialog about the family's power when they work together blah blah blah and the characters all become so annoying that you'll wear out your fast forward button. If you make it to the end you'll be treated to an absurd sequence where the family goes into the spirit world and floats around like Christopher Reeves' Superman. These scenes are so incredibly goofy I simply cannot do them justice here. If you think you know goofy just wait. The movie A Goofy Movie wasn't as goofy as this movie. The key word here is goofy.You will laugh at this movie but not with it. This movie tries very hard to be funny but fails miserably. Take for instance the classic closing scene Annoying Native American guy and Coach look at Coach's car. Coach says How can I make the car happy? Annoying Native American guy says It wants to go home with me! So Coach gives him the keys and he drives away but then the family realizes that they need a ride home! D'oh! They chase after the car as the credits roll. That's the film's stinger the scene they thought would cement this movie in the hearts of film goers everywhere.

Add to this mix is an Indian played by Will Sampson who tries to protect the family. If this sounds jumbled you should see the movie. The major Problem with this movie is a complete lack of any suspense whatsoever. Any decent horror movie worth its salt has suspense or tries to utilise it because that is what terror is all about the long silences waiting for something to happen the build up to it... Poltergeist 2 simply does not even try in this areaFor example when carol Anne sees Kane at the mall menacing and staring at her in order to build up the tension Director Brian Gibson didn't need to show us that Kane was a ghost any director with any idea of suspense would have let us make up our own minds as soon as we see Kane walking through people and things we know straight away what he is and any suspense vanishes. as a result pic becomes predictable and boring the effects are hammy and aside from Julian Beckwho gives the movies only high point with a terrifically creepy performanceJobeth Williams and Craig T Nelson look bored to death. It says an awful lot that i rated the 3rd instalment higher than this drivel and believe me that was no classic by any means.".

	schema:headline " A depressing mess of a movie";
	schema:reviewBody "There are so many things wrong with POLTERGEIST II that it's not worth listing all of them. Suffice it to say I find this movie very depressing mainly because of Heather O'Rourke and her untimely death after making POLTERGEIST III. It's difficult to watch a movie about evil characters trying to kill Heather when you know she died as a kid in real life. The other depressing aspects are everything else in this movie story  script acting special effects etc. It's bad and nothing works. The scene when Craig Nelson vomits that monster is stupid. The horror elements are totally disjointed and don't make any sense at all. But the worst thing about this sequel aside from the scenes taking place on the other side is the fact that this big budget movie is only 87 minutes long and yet if feels like it's three hours long. Such a short running time for such a big studio project is ALWAYS a bad sign a lot of stuff must have been edited out and in this case it's true. Take away the time for the opening and closing credits and the movie is probably 77 minutes long. That's only 1 hour and 17 minutes. Avoid this mess.".

Suffice it to say I find this movie very depressing mainly because of Heather O'Rourke and her untimely death after making POLTERGEIST III. It's difficult to watch a movie about evil characters trying to kill Heather when you know she died as a kid in real life.

The result is that the story is too silly and some of the events are recycled and the movie leaves an overall needless impression.Another example of how the movie relies too much on the first movie is the fact that the brought back the character Tangina Barrons. It is understandable why they did it since her character has grown into a well known movie character but I don't know for some reason I feel that the movie would had been better off without her.And poor Craig T. Nelson. He tries very hard to make the unbelievable story line's and ridiculous dialogue's believable. It was a shame to see him struggle with the line's so much. He does his very best but the end result isn't always successful.Another problem I had with the movie is that it wasn't scary. Main reason for this is that there now is a main villain in an human form. Granted the the actor Julian Beck who portrays him is one scary looking guy but he seemed more like a psycho than a creep from another dimension. Yes Julian Beck acts very well and even though he isn't the right villain for this movie he was still one of the highlights. He also really seemed to be in serious pain by every line he delivered I don't know if this has anything to do by his decease which claimed his life or if it just is his way of acting. But it doesn't really matter with this worthy last role he played the part of his life.But is this movie a complete disaster? No far from it. There are some nice special effects and with Jerry Goldsmith composing an horror score you always have a winner.But anyway overall another needless sequel that only might be recommendable if you also liked the superior first movie.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Not even Heather O'Rourke may she rest in peace could save this franchise. Tobe Hooper'sStephen Spielberg's joint collaboration on Poltergeist made it my favorite movie ever unfortunately the success of the first movie is the only reason the next two movies were made. Not even the acting was immune to the switch in directors Brian Gibson utterly destroys the oncestellar performances of both Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams as Steve and Diane Freeling so much so that the two wisely failed to show up for the third and thankfully last installment. Gibson then gave up to hand the failure to director Gary Sherman who carried the same desperate storyline of Reverend Kane into Poltergeist III and who did only a slightly better job than Gibson incidentally the actor who played Kane in Poltergeist II Julian Beck also jumped ship. Both sequels rely on cheap jump gags bizarre and unexplained twists disjointed subplots tedious dialogue and weird and boring gore. The music in Poltergeist III which is itself poor lets you know everything before it happens and Nancy Allen's performance greatly underscores the performance she gave us in Robocop. There is even a hanging thread in the third movie we never know what happens to one of the characters. Yawned throughout both. Total junk if corny fright is what you're after you'd be better off with a traditional slasher.With regards to the Reverend Kane plot it was invented solely so Gibson could continue the franchise. To Gibson's credit it would have been hard to pick up the story believably anyway as the conflict in Poltergeist had been completely resolved by the end of the movie in typical Spielberg fashion and possibly even as a warning by Spielberg to any wouldbe successors to leave the story alone. Gibson however could have worked harder to integrate the original and riveting antagonist with his sequel instead of shall we say booting it retroactively out the door. I'm sorry but you can't rewrite a movie as huge as Poltergeist like that and expect its fans to accept you for it.Whereas Poltergeist was nominated for three Oscars won a BAFTA film award won the Saturn Award in three categories along with three other nominations and was nominated for a Young Artist Award Poltergeist II was nominated for only a single Oscar and two Saturn Awards I can only imagine out of pity it won the BMI Film Music award presumably as a postfacto nod to composer Jerry Goldsmith who didn't manage to clinch the Oscar for best music and original score in Poltergeist and who like almost all of the other talent with the exception of flagship Heather O'Rourke didn't stick around for Poltergeist III. Poltergeist II is also the first movie that received a nomination for a Razzie and again a Young Artist award nomination for Heather O'Rourke. But Poltergeist III simply got the cold shoulder with just two nominations a Saturn Award for Zelda Rubinstein's decent performance and a Razzie Award for the same. Game over.While Poltergeist III could be interpreted as more inspired and creative than Poltergeist II with only modestly worse acting a slightly faster plot and a single quip by a sideactor that actually made me laugh it was scorched by viewers and pundits presumably because everyone was now simply disappointed and tired. Heather O'Rourke aged twelve knew the original Spielberginspired ride was long due to be over too when she said I hope to do a different character some day. I'm tired of this one kind of. If there is a sequel a 'Poltergeist IV' I hope it's the last. Out of the mouths of babes.".

There is just something about this movie that is so unique in every way.The characters in this movie are so fantastically unique quirky and lovable. It all just came together for a greater unity. The role of Louis Ives played by Paul Dano was the quirkiest of all struggling to find his place in life dealing with his sexuality and the admiration of Henry and trying to find acceptance. And I must admit that Paul Dano portrayed his character in a very good way he was awesome in this movie. And his resemblance to a young Liam Neeson is just uncanny.Moving on to the role of Henry Harrison played by Kevin Kline well his role was eccentric and strict. But as usual Kline put on a magnificent performance. He is very charismatic and have a good voice. He is indeed one of the better actors of recent times.And also not forgetting the strange character of Gershon Gruen played by John C. Reilly was also very memorable and lovable especially his voice.In all fairness then this movie worked so good on all levels. However I think that a share of people might be put off by the movie as it does have that certain epic cinema moment to it and also dealing with and I use this term in lack of better sexually deviant behavior. For me I found that aspect of the movie to be one of the driving factors because it showed how Louis Ives was struggling to find himself and dealing with his needs.The movie is very beautiful in more than one way. The story is beautiful the cinematography is beautiful the music is beautiful and so forth. This is one of the better movies I have seen in a while. It is a fresh breath of change in the movie scene for me. Nice with a movie that stands out from the mainstream comedies and dares to be so unique as it is.If you haven't already seen The Extra Man then you owe it to yourself to do so especially if you are like me a lover of the cinema and movies. This is a story that will stay with you for a long long time.Thumbs up way way up from me!".

It is a confusing tale to watch but has moments of comedic insight and a cat of well known actors that help to make the film entertaining  if a bit of fluff.We meet English teacher Louis Ives Paul Dano after a prelude of daydreaming the three factors that characterize Louis  his obsession with classic literature of the 1920s his untrained perception of how to relate to people 'awkward' would be a kind term and his penchant for fantasizing about cross dressing. He is dismissed from his school 'due to budget cuts' read 'having been discovered trying on a bra and being caught by the headmaster' yet his inappropriate response is one of glee at having been given the opportunity to move to Manhattan to become a writer. Once in New York City without connections he answers an ad for an inexpensive apartment sharing  the ad having been submitted by one very strange Henry Harrison Kevin Kline an older down on his heels writer and playwright who supports himself teaching college level literature and who considers himself an aristocrat serving as an 'escort' for older wealthy women. After an uncomfortable interview Henry consents to allow Louis to be his roommate after weighing his options Louis accepts the room in the flea infested filthy apartment and begins trying to get to know the secretive and zany Henry.Henry provides companionship for one Vivian Marion Seldes and eventually Louis is brought in as an 'extra man' to provide companionship for one of Vivian's friends Celia Watson. In the meantime Louis finds work as a telephone salesman for a Green magazine meets the pretty but unavailable Mary Katie Holmes begins to encounter Henry's entourage of loonies such as Henry's bearded and dirty repairman Gershon John C.

	schema:reviewBody "This little gem is structured and unfolds like an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel complete with continual Gatsbyesque references to Hamptonslike settings which we are informed at the very beginning when the two principal characters Kline and Dano are introduced as lovers of and teachers of Gatsby period literature. I don't quite understand some of the negative comments in other reviews since this offbeat character study is wellscripted and certainly well executed with Dano Kline and Riley. The only problem I can see is the lack of a back story at the beginning that explains the many quirks upon which rest the narration and the character development. SPOILER Are we so jaded by Hollywood banality that we can't wait till the end of the film to see that Kline's character Henry has been telling the truth about himself all along that he is a Rosenkavalier the theme is underscored by the subplot whether or not the young Louis will marry the old rich woman's niece? The end in fact cleverly establishes the ambiguity that seems to dominate the movie but in fact is a precise and welltargeted resolution. In fact it is the contrast between the apparently shallow lifestyle to which he aspires with all his parasitical schemes and his brutal honesty throughout for example admitting that he is manoeuvring his roommate DanoLouis Ives merely to get a ride is what carries the psychological mechanics of the movie. This is made clear at the end by several scenes and twists which I won't reveal here. In the end we see that the socialite salon society to which the Extra Man aspires extra as in making up the balance in the boygirl equilibrium of dinner parties is not really lampooned nor the subject of parody but is in fact a viable space where people can be just as real as anyone else who wears jeans and baseball caps  vain and narcissistic yes but also generous honest selfsacrificing and especially capable of living according to a strict code that obliges selfhonesty in the midst of meaningless rituals of chivalric obligation and politeness. This film can also been seen as a kind of Bildungssroman a voyage of exploration of a young acolyte at the hands of an older mentor with a twist of course since the young man in this case explores sexual paths not sanctioned by the older Kline. Yet in the end we are not sure if the older mentor or the younger disciple or even the court jester Riley is the motivating force for selfawareness. The film works on many levels obviously and this in large because the minimalist script is very efficient and in part because the actors are great. Worth the time and intellectual investment helps to watch at least partly aware and awake. Kline should be applauded for an intelligent performance that transforms quirks weirdness and eccentricity into a believable portrait of warped but very real idealism.".

If you are going to see this movie I suggest you do not read this or any other reviews and go and see the movie for yourself. Spoilers.The first problem was that I walked into this film with high expectations. With Kevin Kline John C. Reilly and a classically clich but always amusing plot line as per the previews of an outdated aristocrat teaching his trade? How could it go wrong?Well the plot that I expected was completely lost in the film's actual theme which was repressed sexual deviations in people who actually desire to live normal morally upstanding lives. It followed the tune of Russian literature thematically taking a psychological aspect of a person and exploring it to the point at which the characters become the trait that they are created to express resulting in the creation of purely ridiculous scenarios. And that sort of thing can be done well. But Paul Dano's character was apparently intended to act out the part of a crossdressing dead fish which he did admirably. His acting was horribly overblown but it actually served to make his character a little like a stuckup version of Michael Sera. And after two hours of watching this on screen I was glad to leave the theatre. Katie Holmes...I don't even know what she was doing up there. She acted a girl who had a relatively normal caring but sometimes insensitive boyfriend. And that didn't take much acting. I still don't understand why her presence in the film was even warranted as her character...was superfluous. Hers amounted to little more than filler time. I suppose the only way in which this film surpassed my expectations lies in the fact that it surprised me in some way. It wasn't the cheesy 'coming of age''studentteacher' movie that I expected. But I'd have been happier if I'd been right because a simpler plot might have allowed the actors to figure out what the hell they were supposed to be conveying to the audience at any given point in the film. As it was Kevin Kline still managed to bring some humor to the table making what would otherwise have been a dreary piece of work somewhat less so. John C. Reilly did as well for about five minutes. It's a shame that's all the time he was given. Granted it's a better film than most mainstream behemoths. But it wasn't nearly as entertaining as the majority of those and it ultimately left me asking not 'Where are we?' as suggested by the film but rather Why am I here?".

He seems to be confused about whether or not he wants the experience of being with women or BEING a woman his hidden fetish is cross dressing and there are several ambiguous questions about both his and Kline's sexuality that are never fully resolved. It would appear that at the film's end he's achieved some enlightenment about himself but what that enlightenment is I certainly couldn't tell you.Dano is pretty good despite limitations in the material Kline is merely serviceable. The film also stars John C. Reilly and Katie Holmes who shows some spunk as a coworker of Dano but whose role feels oddly truncated.Grade C".

Unfortunatelythe script was not quite up to snuff. I found the characters unlikeable. Poor J.C.R. had to resort to a silly gimmick to make his character even interesting. Mr. Kline did the best he could with a very weak script. It was obvious that he was improvising quite a lot. The younger character had a few interesting parts but overall it was very unorganized.

Natalie Portman's character upon introduction is guessed to be a love interest that will transform correct our young protagonist. But that is too easy and not what THE EXTRA MAN is about.

A comparison can be made to John Irvings books and characters though therein the characters seem outofplace in their setting and almost apologetic for their bizarreness. Here the movie ends with absolutely no apologies and in the only place it could end the milieu of NYC.The major fault of the film is that it may appear to be offered as a comedy. There are chuckles but THE EXTRA MAN is not particularly funny. The film would have been better presented as a drama. THE EXTRA MAN is most surely not mainstream material and one of those projects that is lucky to have been made. I'm still on the fence with Paul Dano. I wouldn't flunk his performance but some one more earnest e.g. a young Andrew McCarthy would have been a better fit.".

He is also remarkably blessed in his cast with Lockwood and Redgrave possessing considerable chemistry and Dame May Witty particularly endearing in one of the character roles at which she so excelled the supporting cast is also particularly memorable.Hitchcock guides them all with never a misstep through a complex script that progresses from very lighthearted to extremely sinister and then back again and the result leaves audiences with both the satisfaction of a wellmade thriller and the glow of a romantic comedy. Although it lacks the subtle tones of his later work THE LADY VANISHES is among my own favorites by Hitchcock and fans who have never seen it are in for a real treat. Highly recommended.Gary F.

	schema:headline " An early view into Hitch's genius";
	schema:reviewBody "From 1938 The Lady Vanishes is clearly where Hitch was getting comfortable in his trade. Starting slowly it soon revs up with mystery and intrigue. But I think that was the whole point. A seemingly innocuous day can lead itself into adventure.Starting in some remote European village a woman meets a little old lady. Getting on the train the next day the old lady vanishes without a trace while she is asleep. When she asks about the lady people say that there was no old lady. The mystery then ensues as our leading lady tries to uncover the plot behind a woman she knows was there.The main aspect of this movie is the everyday humor that is applied. The two English fellows who are only looking for the latest cricket scores score themselves some remarkable laughs. Our hero that comes to the leading woman's assistance is funny and charming himself. The time spent at the beginning in the hotel may seem to be off topic making a viewer wonder where the mystery is but the point is that the viewer becomes acquainted with the characters and are much more believable to the viewer. Again I think Hitch was showing us our next door neighbors and how they can rise up against unusually dangerous circumstances. I think my analysis of Hitch would be his championing the moral fiber of everyman. I think that is why Hitchcock films still stand today as some of the best ever made.This movie receives my major recommendation. Not done yet. I got more to view and review. What fun!".

But I think that was the whole point. A seemingly innocuous day can lead itself into adventure.Starting in some remote European village a woman meets a little old lady. Getting on the train the next day the old lady vanishes without a trace while she is asleep. When she asks about the lady people say that there was no old lady.

Cecil Parker Mr Todhunter has his own reasons for keeping quiet as he does not want his illicit affair with Linden Travers to become public knowledge. Several other passengers on the train have seen Miss Froy but do not want to be involved which confuses our heroine and places her in grave danger as the journey progresses.Shame about the fake model shots at the start of the film but this aside Hitchcock skilfully keeps the suspense at a high level and the witty script by Sidney Gilliatt and Frank Launder is both entertaining and enthralling.

Merely a very subjective image.Although The Lady Vanishes is one of Hitchcock's very early black and white British films 1938 it anticipates the future expertise skills and talent of this accomplished director and is well worth viewing. If you are waiting to spot Hitchcock's regular cameo appearance this doesn't take place until the closing minutes of the film so settle back and enjoy the plot then watch out for Hitchcock smoking a cigar at Victoria Station almost at the end!

	schema:reviewBody "Before Alfred Hitchcock struck gold with such well known films as Vertigo and Psycho he made films in his native country England. It was in the UK that he filmed such 1930s classics as The 39 Steps The Man Who Knew Too Much and Sabotage. Among these was another slightly forgotten classic 1938's The Lady Vanishes. It starts as a cheery lightweight romp it becomes a suspensefilled mystery and it ends as an engaging thriller. Most movies nowadays get stuck in a rut and become nothing more than a runofthemill action extravaganza set in a simple plot which serves as the way to get the characters on screen. Hitchcock did something else He cared about the plot stretched it out and made it elaborately intriguing and then filled it in with the characters afterwards.There's a mastermind behind this and it belongs to that big horror master himself. The Lady Vanishes is one of his best early films and it would be his last British film a true sign of what was to come in the later years of his life. It was remade in 1979 with Elliot Gould and Cybill Shepherd but lacked the freshness and striking narrative that the original contains.In Germany prior to World War II a young woman travels cross country in a train with an eccentric woman known as Miss Froy Dame May Whitty as a companion. Froy is a short little woman who reeks of naivety and innocence. But perhaps not everything is as plain and simple as it seemsafter falling asleep on the train for a short time period Iris Margaret Lockwood the young traveler awakens to find Miss Froy absent from her seat opposite herself.The worst thing of all is that no one recalls having seen a little old lady aboard the train. Iris looks like a delusional loony and she even starts to doubt the story herself when odd clues start to turn up throughout the train. Enlisting the help of Gilbert Redman Michael Redgrave a goofy man who is crazy enough to believe Iris' story the two search in a frantic race before their train meets its arrival and Miss Froy is unloadedif she's even still on the train.The fundamentals of the story lie in its plot and also in its characters. They're all lovable from Gilbert to Caldicott Naunton Wayne and Charters Basil Redford two traveling men looking to get back to England for a cricket tournament. After the train is stopped towards the end of the film and a band of Germans tries to board the plane one of the men quips to the other something to the effect of We'll never be back for the cricket match now.It's interesting how so many mysteries make so much sense by the end but you can't for the life of you guess the ending ahead of time. Sometimes this is not the case I guessed the surprise ending of Identity from the trailer especially nowadays with each mystery film being a retread of The Sixth Sense. But back in the Hitch days most every mystery was a complex one that had a totally unexpected climatic ending. Filmed on an extremely low budget The Lady Vanishes surprisingly boasts some amazing special effects in some areas at least for the decade the movie was filmed in. One of these is when Gilbert climbs the exterior of the train and on the opposite tracks another train swooshes by knocking him backwards. You find this type of lowbudget effect nowadays in homemade movies but then it was quite good.But other scenes are not quite as exquisite. The opening scene post credits in which the camera swoops down into a small German village is filmed well but the background and foreground are both models. If you look closely you can see that the village folk walking along the street aren't actually walking at allthey're miniature figurines! Look for the little toy car that drives by behind the buildingstuff like this is classic! But even with a horrible budget Hitchcock manages to control the scene the way he wants. It shows that even with a minimal amount of money he still tried to make everything intriguing and mysterious.And that he did. Not only is The Lady Vanishes one of the best mysteries of all time it's one of the best films of all time too. It takes a while to start but once it does does it ever! It's low budget yes but not nearly as hard to make out as The 39 Steps one of Hitch's earlier British films. There are a lot of Hitchcock fanatics out there and they may not have even heard of some of his earlier lesser known films. Plus they may be turned off by how hard it is to make out dialogue and scenes. The Man Who Knew Too Much is notorious for being hard to understand. And so for interested Hitchcock fans your journey starts here.Note Towards the end of the film look for a quick Alfred Hitchcock cameo. He's the man at Victoria Station who walks by with a cigarette.55 stars.John Ulmer".

	schema:headline " A Million Mexicans Can't Be Wrong!";
	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock was noted for his light comic touch but history records only one attempt at a fullout comedy 1955's The Trouble With Harry. The real trouble with Harry is it's not funny but fortunately Hitchcock did leave us with a much surer and defter comedy in the guise of a thriller. Enter The Lady Vanishes.The opening scene gets a lot of hackles from people as we find ourselves in a mountain valley where after the credits roll the camera glides over what is obviously a miniature train set. We even see a toy roadster glide by as the camera closes on the exterior of a model house.Why it's so primitive and fake! exclaim viewers accustomed to Matrixstyle FX.But they miss the point and not just because they fail to take account of the time when the film was made. Here's what I think Hitchcock shot the scene with a deliberate nod at the hokeyness of it reminding his audience from the start that this is not the real thing but playacting to be taken as such. He knows it looks a bit phony though the arresting panandzoom would be the sort of opening other directors would imitate as soon as the technology let them. The focus of The Lady Vanishes is not politics or even mystery. It is fun in the same noncritical way as a child's entertainment. In this Hitchcock succeeds and creates no mere time capsule but a vessel of entertainment that has withstood decades of changing fashion because it is first last and always fun.The Lady Vanishes is the sort of film that works on pace craft and charm. The plot is well thoughtout provided you yourself try not to think about it much. There's really no reason for the story to go down the way it does and once the movie is over you begin to see the holes. Why is it necessary for British intelligence to go through so much trouble for info that could be just as easily delivered by telegram or diplomatic pouch? Why if you coldbloodedly swipe a woman from a train do you leave a witness behind to blurt out that there's been a disappearance? How come a name written on the inside of a train compartment window is erased by a blast of locomotive smoke across the outside of the window? But the engaging plot does what it is supposed to keeping you interested and wondering what will happen next rather than why it is happening the way it is.The storyline of The Lady Vanishes is unlike any Hitchcock film. It's so light and airy that it reminds me more of a Tintin comic book with the mythical Slavic nation of Vandreka the sort of simultaneously quaint and suspicious setting Herge would stick Captain Haddock and the Thompson Twins. Leave aside your sophisticated Dashiell Hammettfed expectations for a moment. If you let yourself go you will be transported and quite entertained. Hitchcock never meshed comedy so thoroughly in the body of a story as he does here. Even North By Northwest has its serious spots but The Lady Vanishes features a tense fight in a baggage car that's right out of Abbott  Costello and a climactic shootout that pauses for jokes between Caldicott and Charters the cricketmad pair who are a nonstop font of humor.Margaret Lockwood is an effective plot vehicle as doughty Iris who refuses to believe a knock on the head made her imagine the presence of the title character Miss Froy. Michael Redgrave Vanessa's pop is a revelation as Gilbert the folkmusic scholar who halfhumors halfbelieves her strange tale until a stray scrap of trash converts him to her cause. He has a wonderful Errol Flynnlike quality with his toothbrush mustache and his way with a quip.Speaking of quips the dialogue in this movie sparkles throughout as when the barrister tells his mistress The law like Caesar's wife must be above reproach and she replies Even when the law just spent six weeks with Caesar's wife? Or when Iris asks how she was supposed to have replaced Miss Froy's face with that of the sinister Madame Kummer and Gilbert replies Any change would be an improvement.Interesting also for the opening which ambles on for about 20 minutes before it starts to go anywhere establishing the characters and the comic tone without offering a whiff of what the mystery might be. The close too with villains who seem oddly detached once the story is resolved 'Jolly good luck to them' Paul Lukas observes enigmatically. But that's for film scholars to muse over.Hitchcock was never as agreeable a companion as he was here. And few films will put the kind of smile on your face like 'The Lady Vanishes' no matter how long ago it was made.".

He knows it looks a bit phony though the arresting panandzoom would be the sort of opening other directors would imitate as soon as the technology let them. The focus of The Lady Vanishes is not politics or even mystery. It is fun in the same noncritical way as a child's entertainment. In this Hitchcock succeeds and creates no mere time capsule but a vessel of entertainment that has withstood decades of changing fashion because it is first last and always fun.The Lady Vanishes is the sort of film that works on pace craft and charm. The plot is well thoughtout provided you yourself try not to think about it much. There's really no reason for the story to go down the way it does and once the movie is over you begin to see the holes. Why is it necessary for British intelligence to go through so much trouble for info that could be just as easily delivered by telegram or diplomatic pouch? Why if you coldbloodedly swipe a woman from a train do you leave a witness behind to blurt out that there's been a disappearance? How come a name written on the inside of a train compartment window is erased by a blast of locomotive smoke across the outside of the window? But the engaging plot does what it is supposed to keeping you interested and wondering what will happen next rather than why it is happening the way it is.The storyline of The Lady Vanishes is unlike any Hitchcock film. It's so light and airy that it reminds me more of a Tintin comic book with the mythical Slavic nation of Vandreka the sort of simultaneously quaint and suspicious setting Herge would stick Captain Haddock and the Thompson Twins. Leave aside your sophisticated Dashiell Hammettfed expectations for a moment. If you let yourself go you will be transported and quite entertained. Hitchcock never meshed comedy so thoroughly in the body of a story as he does here. Even North By Northwest has its serious spots but The Lady Vanishes features a tense fight in a baggage car that's right out of Abbott  Costello and a climactic shootout that pauses for jokes between Caldicott and Charters the cricketmad pair who are a nonstop font of humor.Margaret Lockwood is an effective plot vehicle as doughty Iris who refuses to believe a knock on the head made her imagine the presence of the title character Miss Froy. Michael Redgrave Vanessa's pop is a revelation as Gilbert the folkmusic scholar who halfhumors halfbelieves her strange tale until a stray scrap of trash converts him to her cause. He has a wonderful Errol Flynnlike quality with his toothbrush mustache and his way with a quip.Speaking of quips the dialogue in this movie sparkles throughout as when the barrister tells his mistress The law like Caesar's wife must be above reproach and she replies Even when the law just spent six weeks with Caesar's wife? Or when Iris asks how she was supposed to have replaced Miss Froy's face with that of the sinister Madame Kummer and Gilbert replies Any change would be an improvement.Interesting also for the opening which ambles on for about 20 minutes before it starts to go anywhere establishing the characters and the comic tone without offering a whiff of what the mystery might be. The close too with villains who seem oddly detached once the story is resolved 'Jolly good luck to them' Paul Lukas observes enigmatically. But that's for film scholars to muse over.Hitchcock was never as agreeable a companion as he was here. And few films will put the kind of smile on your face like 'The Lady Vanishes' no matter how long ago it was made.";

Sir Michael Redgrave also is wonderful as the obvious love interest of Lockwood. The film is truly filled with Hitchcock's stamp all over it. He takes a simple story and makes us not only intriguing but entertaining as well. They remade the film again in 1978 more than 40 years after this film debuted in British cinema. This classic film should not be mixed up with that one. I enjoyed this film. It had its humorous moments. I think this film is really wonderful to watch without being too much. Nowadays filmmakers can take note by Hitchcock's genius and talent. You do not need grand special effects today to create a memorable film but great actors and decent writing. This film is a great film about a good old fashioned mystery without deterring the audience. This film is good old fashioned movie making at its best.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the best of the early Hitchcock films.  The plot is absorbing the dialogue clever and the cast great.  Whether or not this was the first of the director's films to place its principal action on a moving train I cannot say but it's a theme that would come back again in his later work most notably in Strangers on a Train.The film gets off to a somewhat rocky start with the camera panning over an Alpine inn and a train halted midjourney by an avalanche.  I agree with the review who observes that we've become spoilt by more sophisticated special effects.  A Lionel half buried in a heap of bleached wheat flower just doesn't cut it nowadays.  Think also of the stick figure engulfed in the munitions factory explosion in Saboteur.  I suppose directors of that era had to do with whatever was available.But after this point the film really takes off and one scarcely recalls the unpromising opening.  Viewers always look for the chemistry or lack thereof between actors.  Well Lockwood and Redgrave definitely have it.  One cannot help but enjoy seeing how the initial sparks flying between their clashing characters develop into true love by movie's end.  As the two are making their way through the train trying to locate Whitty they move from one barely plausible predicament to another.  But we love it as one witty exchange turns quickly into another.  For example Lockwood is asked to describe the missing Whitty and launches into an extremely detailed portrait that leaves not a single button unaccounted for.  Then she ends by saying That's all I can remember.  Counters Redgrave dryly Well you can't have been paying attention.Much of the film's action occurs in the fictional country of Bandrika which seems to be a thinly disguised standin for nazicontrolled Austria so recently annexed by Hitler's Germany.  As an amateur linguist I found myself trying to make sense of the madeup Bandrikan spoken by the natives but of course was unable to do so.  What could it be?  A FinnoUgric language?   Most of the time the identity of Hitchcock's villains remains deliberately vague except in Notorious and Torn Curtain where they are nazis and communists respectively.  It works better when he leaves us guessing.As an amateur musician I loved Hitch's macguffin namely the secret formula encoded in a song which the protagonists had to memorize and carry to the Foreign Office in London.  I should think however that a genuine secret message might translate into something more like Schoenberg's twelvetone music than a central European folk song but of course that would hardly work in a film. The early Hitchcock seemed to like shootouts as seen also in the first version of The Man Who Knew Too Much. But shootouts are an ineffective way to convey suspense and this is perhaps the one thing that dims what is otherwise a masterpiece.It's too bad the director lived long enough to see this film remade in 1979. Cybil Shepherd is no Margaret Lockwood and it's pretty unpleasantalmost embarrassingto see her shrieking her way through each scene.  Couldn't they have waited a few years until he had passed on?  They ought to have let him die in peace.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lady Vanishes is early Hitchcock. It was made when he was still finding his feet and style as a filmmaker. It is nevertheless a cracking thriller and a hugely entertaining film. Quite different from a lot of Hitchcock's thriller the film doesn't throw you in at the deep end at the beginning. Hitchcock takes a good twenty or so minutes setting up the characters before even boarding the train. It seems to me that the plot of the lady vanishing is the McGuffin of the film and the main plot is the relationship between the main characters. It is also in the first twenty minutes when we see the typical Englishness of the piece  complaining about weatherboard and talking cricket. The Lady Vanishes was Hitchcock's penultimate British film before leaving for America and it is up there with The 39 Steps as one of that era's best.When the film does board the train it turns into thrillermystery mode and Hitchcock shows an expertise in mystery and tension building worthy of his later more famous thrillers. The train as Hitchcock knows all too well makes a great setting for a thriller. The tight environment multiple carriages and constant movement allow for mystery suspense and excitement  view Hitchcock mix then all up when Redgrave's characters nearly gets mashed by an oncoming train as he attempts to move to another room by the outside.Hitchcock had a great talent when it came to casting his films. He filled his main and supporting characters with likable charismatic people who were right for the roles. The Lady Vanishes is no exception in this regard. Lockwood and Redgrave have fine chemistry between them and create a duo which anchors the film. For a plot like this it would be essential for the main duo to be likable so the audience can follow them through their detective work and they do a great job in creating a likable duo. The snappy repartee between the two is perhaps the film's highlight.The film's editing is excellent. I find that in a lot of film like this the last act tends to drag as I become increasingly restless in wanting to know what the big secret is. The Lady Vanishes doesn't fall into this trap and runs very smoothly and doesn't outstay its welcome. The cinematography is also excellent. Although the shots are apparently fairly simple one should consider the complexity of trying to get these shots done in such a tight enclosure and keep up the appearance that it is happening on a moving train. I haven't read or heard anything from experts about this film so I don't know whether Hitchcock used a real train or a stage with rear projection or something similar. But in the film itself I couldn't see any goofs that would ruin the film's illusion.You won't see this film top many best Hitchcock list because it isn't as artistically sound as a lot of his later works but the film was made in 1938 just as international relations were reaching boiling point and there is certainly some subtext in the film about it. One can look at the scene were a man refuses to fight despite the enemy steadily approaching the train as an attack on the appeasement of the Nazi. Or the cricket chaps concern about their own trivialities and their refusal to get involve in the bigger more important issue.The Lady Vanishes is a gripping yarn that is sure to absorb one's attention and excite as much or even more as any film made today. It doesn't trade off characters for action. It has an intelligent script with witty dialogue and distinct memorable characters. The film does have a fair few plot holes like a lot of Hitchcock's thriller but they don't matter while watching the film as he never gives your breath to think about them. He forces you to move along with the engaging plot. Whether one looks at the film as mere entertainment or as a commentary on the times it is sure not to disappoint.".

At the film's beginning we see a town model  very nice but just a model  of a snowy village in a fictional country somewhere in Eastern Europe. I still opt for Austria the uniforms we later see certainly appear like AustroHungarian military uniforms of World War I even though that war is long past. Anyway inclement weather has forced train passengers into a hotel run by a harried manager. Many are stranded English citizens eager to return home for a variety of reasons. We are introduced to Caldicott and Charters Naunton Wayne Basil Radford two buffoonish Englishmen whose main interest is leaving the wretched country to return in time for the Test Match cricket. As the game is their only concern nothing else is of interest. Caldicott and Charters are quite the superficial characters and they will be with us with their dry humor throughout the movie. They are lucky to get a room in the overcrowded hotel but it is the maid Anna's room. She still needs to change there and she no qualms of undressing with the two men present. Caldicott and Charters have no choice but to share a bed and pajamas. Iris Henderson Margaret Lockwood an attractive but bratty socialite is on a ski holiday with her two friends it is her last bachelorette fling before her loveless wedding in the upcoming week. What else can she do as she feels she has done everything that she wants? Money talks and the three young women get a nice room. Eric and Margaret Todhunter are traveling incognito they are not married but on a tryst cheating on their spouses. Of course Eric had told Margaret that he would divorce his wife to marry her of course he has no intention of doing so. He values his judgeship more that is if he can get the position. Miss Froy Dame May Witty an elderly and kindly old English governess dressed in a tweed outfit is the key personality. At a dinner table she tells Caldicott and Charters that she loves the nation that they are in for it is a musical country. There are other persons of interest on the train including Signor and Signora Doppo. Mr. Doppo has a dopey smile as a circus performer he has an act called The Vanishing Lady. In the evening the three gals are unable to sleep because the people in the room above are dancing to a clarinet. The main character in the upstairs room is raffish music scholar Gilbert Michael Redgrave. Because these people do not stop their rumpus the manager removes Gilbert later he retrieves his room. Miss Froy is on her hotel room balcony listening to a street singer below when the latter is strangled. She does not notice but hums the tune that he was humming. The next morning all of the folks are jampacked together waiting for the train getting ready to leave. While Froy is bending down to get her luggage a flowerbox from a second floor window apparently aimed for her misses and strikes Iris on the head instead dazing her. She still manages to get on the train and wave goodbye to her two girlfriends. Before long Iris still lightheaded has tea with Froy. She does not get Froy's name clearly because of surrounding noise so Froy spells it out on the passenger car window condensation. Iris soon passes out and when she awakens cannot locate Froy. She questions the train passengers and train stewards but none seem to recall Froy at all. The lady has indeed vanished. Actually Caldicott and Charters certainly remember her as they had sat together at the same dining table the previous night. But as the men want no possible interruption of a train search that will interfere with their precious cricket match back home they feign ignorance. Eric Todhunter too has lied because he wants to avoid any attention to his affair with Margaret.On the train is Dr. Hartz Paul Lukas a suspicious brain surgeon from Czechoslovakia. Although he seems willing to help to find Miss Froy it is obvious that he is actually doing the opposite. And he says that Iris because of her slight concussion may not be thinking clearly. There is no Miss Froy there never was a Miss Froy. Merely a very subjective image. Meanwhile at the next train stop a heavily bandaged patient on a stretcher is let aboard. Dr. Hartz says that he will operate on him at a hospital at the next train stop. Now a nun assists the patient. Iris becomes suspicious as she wears high heels. But the only one willing to help is Gilbert who had earlier repulsed her with his hotel shenanigans. But Iris has nowhere else to turn. As our two heroes investigate they become friendly with each other. They eventually discover that not only is Miss Froy aboard but also is in danger. Will Iris remember Froy's name on the car window? Maybe Froy is indeed the patient on the stretcher! Here the situation directed by the movie master really begins to build tension. There are neat clues. The pace quickens. Note how the main characters react when they realize that they are in the middle of a menace. Is Doppo involved? The pseudonun? A German Madame Kummer malevolently looking in tweed who appeared unexpectedly? Dr. Hartz? No spoilers will be given here but there will be a train diversion and an exciting shootout. Caldicott and Charters may have a use after all.Alfred Hitchcock in all of his quickwittedness has poised himself to begin making some of the greatest movies in world cinema history in the upcoming decades.

	schema:reviewBody "The Lady Vanishes 1938A Hitchcock movie filled with mystery but lacking suspense. Which is quite fine turning The Lady Vanishes into a fun movie with lots of wry jokes and clever twists. You can't take it any more seriously than Hitchcock did and he famously had fun with his ideas. That's one reason why they are recognizably Hitch.This is a transitional movie for the director in many ways. For one thing it was hugely successful in Britain and then later in the U.S. and Hitchcock soon moved to Hollywood where his stellar string of successes for over 20 years began. But that said this is a film filled with provincial humor that was a joke in case you are Britishthat is you need to have a feel for British humor and for the style of joking and making witty remarks constantly of the time. It's a hilarious movie. When you aren't laughing you're still tickled.Which is what disappoints some viewers expecting Psycho or something. Nope. But you'll recognize the director's hand here mixing regular people who are misunderstood if not quite accused of something they didn't do and who end up having to solve the problem themselves. And so it goes and they do rather well for a couple of ordinary folk.When I say there is no suspense I mean it even when there is uncertainty. The biggest twist of the whole plot not to be mentioned here! is only kept from the viewer for a short while. Then the actors tell you! Yes you are let in on the secret and yet the movie goes on from there. That isit's not about worrying and trying to figure it out. It's about watching the main characters work together and piece together their way out of a sticky situation. And of course eventually fall in love.You forget sometimes that the key element in nearly every Hitchcock movie is a love story. After all that's what matters to most of us or all of us? day after day so he zeroes in on that even as the world is threatened by uranium 235 Notorious a murderer in the apartment complex Rear Window the ghost of a previous wife Rebecca and so on. Of these Psycho is an interesting exception. So watch what is actually a romantic comedy with a dash of international intrigue in the ominous year leading up to WWII which hasn't happened at the time of filming. Great stuff.".

	schema:headline " Delightfully absurd comic thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock is fond of telling the story of one man fighting against staggering odds. The man is often falsely accused as in The Wrong Man or The 39 Steps. Or accidentally enters into a world of horrors that they can't escape as in The Birds or Psycho. And sometimes the lead accidentally becomes part of a large conspiracy in which they are forced to participate as in North by Northwest and The Man Who Knew Too Much. Hithchcock is fond of the reluctant hero or heroine people who fall into impossibly difficult situations that they did not choose for themselves. In this way his movies even those that would not be labeled horror films are like nightmares. The protagonist wants to scream out this can't be happening but barely has time to think as the rogue crop duster bears down on him trying to slice him in half. We tend to identify with the Hitchcock hero who is often ordinarythough still very much movie starswhether they be Cary Grant living at home with his mother or hardworking family man Henry Fonda.The Lady Vanishes is the other type of Hitchcock filmthe type where two wouldbe lovers throw themselves into intrigue partly out of boredom and partly as a means to romance one another. As in Rear Window where a crippled photographer played by James Stewart and a pining Grace Kelly become voyeurs and then detectives Lady features brideinwaiting Iris Henderson Margaret Lockwood on a journey to meet her fiance where she begins to tussle and then solve a mystery with arrogant joker and folk musician Gilbert Michael Redgrave.While on a train journey through the fictional European country of Mandrika Iris notices that Miss Froy the kindly old lady who was sharing a compartment with her doesn't seem to be on the train anymore. Partly out of a need to forestall the doldrums of an unwanted marriage and partly because of the needs of the script Iris throws herself wholeheartedly into finding the missing Miss Froy. Gilbert seeing an opening joins her in a quest. The plot thickens when other passengers claim to have never seen the little old English woman. We are then asked to contemplate whether Iriswho did suffer a blow to the head earlier in the filmmight be imagining Miss Froy or whether some sinister conspiracy is actually at work. A similar question is at the heart of the ludicrous not very funny but highly watchable Jodie Foster thriller Flightplan.Vanishes while ostensibly a mystery is just as much a comedy. Like Nick and Nora in The Thin Man series Iris and Gilbert trade bon mots and blows with bad guys while trying to figure out the mystery. The mystery is a device upon which to hang a comedy of manners. Joining Iris and Gilbert in their comic quest are two stoic British gentlemen who are more concerned with returning to England in time to catch a cricket match than with the increasingly bizarre plot going on around them. Their continued stoical perturbation in the face of mystery and violence is a running joke throughout the film. This joke reaches a glorious comic crescendo when the bullets begin to fly in the film's climax.And what a climax it is as the train's British passengers are faced with a showdown at high tea. The nation of Mandrika confronts the English on the train and they though repeatedly denying Iris's claims and need to take action find their backs against the wall. Among them is a pacifist who as the action heightens becomes cowardice embodied. It is in this climax that the film becomes unexpectedly political. The Lady Vanishes released in 1938 between the two world wars is a comment on the coming conflict and the necessity of war. British who are not willing to enter the fray are naive or foolish.As they are in other Hithcock films the women of Vanishes are smart brave and resourceful. They frequently lead the charge in the film while the men try to keep up. Hitchcock reportedly had testy relationships with his female costars but he frequently provided them with meaty roles. Most movies even contemporary ones are likely to relegate female stars to weak supporting roles where they anxiously stand by while male costars do the fighting. But The Lady Vanishes turns on the actions of several strong female characters.Vanishes is above all a comedy and this intentionally or not takes the edge off the suspense. We are pretty sure all will work out in the end because the barb trading leads need to end up together. It could be argued that the film goes off the rails in the final third when the absurd plot drives the film toward a violent tone shifting climax but I found it in keeping with the delightful absurdity on display throughout the film.In fact each of the film's three acts have there own unique tone. In the first the cast is stranded by snow in a small railside hotel and each is introduced in short comic vignettes. In the second the mystery is afoot. By the third act the mystery is largely solved but a violent conflict erupts. The film under the steady hand of Hitchcock successfully fits these disparate pieces together. While not Hitchcock's best it still is a fun unique film that will keep you entertained.".

The characters are all extremely unique and the acting is amazing. This is a very fun mystery that is surprisingly funny at times especially for a film made in the 30s! There are many layers to this and is a great movie to talk about after viewing it. As you probably know Hitchcock made a brief cameo in the majority of his movies and if I'm not mistaken it happened at 133.35 in this one. Look for a man walking across the train station with a cigarette in his mouth. There is much more to say about this but just go watch it and write your own review at how good this movie truly is.

Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave were great as the two main protagonists and the witty banter between the two was equaled only by the two dry cricketobsessed Englishmen who provided so much of the humor of the film. I found this movie to be similar to Rear Window no wonder I enjoyed it so much as there are many subplots among the minor characters that are almost as interesting as the main story.I firmly believe that this is the best I've seen of Hitchcock's early movies. It has everything from shootouts to nuns in high heels. The Lady Vanishes will convert you to being a fan of Alfred if you're somehow drugs? not already.".

	schema:reviewBody "No need to echo consensus points or recap the plot.Behind the shady doings and mysterious characters I think lies a political subtext appropriate to the time 1938. War with Nazi Germany is on the horizon while things are heating up all over Europe. Yet in the movie's treatment of its British characters England appears woefully detached from the menace. Of course the whimsical Comstock and Charters Wayne  Radford characterize this detachment most obviously in their nearcomical preoccupation with cricket a pasttime identified with English sports. As a result the pair pays little attention to the sinister intrigues going on around them. Equally oblivious are the Todhunters Parker Travers absorbed as they are in running away from their spouses. For the most part they remain closed up in their compartment bickering as if they're not a part of the larger world of the train. Then too Todhunter turns out to be something of an unreliable pacifist once the intrigues engulf him. Even our two stalwarts Iris and Gilbert Lockwood  Redgrave appear on the frivolous side when first we meet them. He's uncaring that his folk music is annoying other guests of the hotel while Iris appears an innocent off on a European getaway. At first his attentions to her appear no more than a flirtatious attempt at exchanging humorous barbs but gradually deepen as the plot thickens.Of course such isolation from the deadly game posed by the sinister Germansounding Dr. Hartz Veidt eventually compels the Brits to break their selfabsorption and engage with the menace that threatens them all. In a sense the film thus serves as a warning to British audiences of the threat posed by the German buildup on the continent. In short England remains vulnerable unless its people pay attention to the wider world the train represents.Of course the subtext as I've suggested is conveyed with typical Hitchcockian style and humor. Then too the cast is flawless especially old gal Dame Mae Witty whose ageing Miss Froy suggests a greater amount of political sophistication than her British compatriots. She's at least old enough to recall the intrigues preceding WWI which may account for her crucial and rallying role.Anyway the movie is plenty enjoyable apart from the conjectures I've offered. I don't claim that either Hitch or the writers intended my interpretation. Instead I suggest it as one way of looking beneath the compelling surface. Nonetheless no matter how you look at it the movie still counts as one of Hitch's best.".

The two leading actors are Margaret Lockwood and Michael Redgrave. Lockwood as Iris Henderson is the spunky and determined friend of an affable governess and as it turns out a secret agent known as Miss Froy who suddenly vanishes from a train as it travels through the Alps. Played by Dame May Witty the governess becomes an unlikely pawn in an espionage game. Michael Redgrave in one of his funniest roles is a musicologist known as Gilbert with a love of folklore. He runs afoul of Iris early in the movie but Iris's beauty and her devotion to her older friend win him over. The two of them become allies as they try to foil a trainload of accomplices in the crime against Miss Froy. We see some great shots from the window of the train as it chugs through the Alps. There is some wicked humour in the filmmaking such as the rabbits peeking out of a magician's hat to view one amusing altercation. Then there is the mute nun who accompanies a patient on board the train. It turns out she is an English woman with a cockney accent and not lost for words. The two sporting enthusiasts who want to get home at all costs to take in a cricket match are amusing if a bit ridiculous but prove useful in the critical moments at the end. All in all a fine movie and a mustsee for Hitchcock admirers.".

	schema:reviewBody "My rule when rating movies is to review it all by itself....don't compare it to something else that's completely different from itself. That's the mindset you have to have when watching Legally Blonde the movie that Reese Witherspoon managed to get a Golden Globe nomination out of. No kidding here. It's really an adorable movie that is appropriate for any age....a very light PG13.Elle Woods 2006 Oscar Winner Reese Witherspoon has it all....the perfect boyfriend Warner who is handsome charming and driven the perfect life awesome friends and a really cute dog. But all of this seems minuscule to the fact that her boyfriend has just dumped her because she is not serious enough and he wants a girl that is well received by the public when he begins his political career. So Warner enrolls at Harvard University leaving Elle it sounds like the letter 'L' disheveled and sad. Then 'going where no blonde has gone before' good use of tagline right? Elle decides to work extra hard to enroll at Harvard to win her man back. Well Elle funny rhyming there achieves the requirements in tests and community service and sends in a very interesting video essay and gains entrance to the prestigious university. She quickly finds out that not only is her dream man already engaged to another woman Selma Blair but Elle is not widely liked around campus. She finds her calling in law and with the guidance of a friend the likable and funny Luke Wilson proves to be a talented prospect in the field.The film is a very watchable film from start to finish as the movie's opening theme song Hoku's hit song Perfect Day is catchy and likable. Reese Witherspoon's performance is so great and hilarious yet so true to herself as a person. She shines like the sun in this movie. It can be a little silly at times not to mention a tad unrealistic and dragging but Witherspoon's ability overshadows those unfortunate facts. The supporting cast is also good with Selma Blair and Luke Wilson leading the bunch. Also in there is 'Waiting...' star Alanna Ubach Matthew Davis Jennifer Coolidge NBC's 'Joey' Ali Larter Victor Garber as Elle's law professor and 'ScoobyDoo' star Linda Cardellini.This is the ultimate 'girl power' movie that every person without a Y chromosome will love.

	onyx:emotionText "My rule when rating movies is to review it all by itself....don't compare it to something else that's completely different from itself. That's the mindset you have to have when watching Legally Blonde the movie that Reese Witherspoon managed to get a Golden Globe nomination out of. No kidding here. It's really an adorable movie that is appropriate for any age....a very light PG13.Elle Woods 2006 Oscar Winner Reese Witherspoon has it all....the perfect boyfriend Warner who is handsome charming and driven the perfect life awesome friends and a really cute dog. But all of this seems minuscule to the fact that her boyfriend has just dumped her because she is not serious enough and he wants a girl that is well received by the public when he begins his political career. So Warner enrolls at Harvard University leaving Elle it sounds like the letter 'L' disheveled and sad. Then 'going where no blonde has gone before' good use of tagline right? Elle decides to work extra hard to enroll at Harvard to win her man back. Well Elle funny rhyming there achieves the requirements in tests and community service and sends in a very interesting video essay and gains entrance to the prestigious university. She quickly finds out that not only is her dream man already engaged to another woman Selma Blair but Elle is not widely liked around campus. She finds her calling in law and with the guidance of a friend the likable and funny Luke Wilson proves to be a talented prospect in the field.The film is a very watchable film from start to finish as the movie's opening theme song Hoku's hit song Perfect Day is catchy and likable. Reese Witherspoon's performance is so great and hilarious yet so true to herself as a person. She shines like the sun in this movie. It can be a little silly at times not to mention a tad unrealistic and dragging but Witherspoon's ability overshadows those unfortunate facts. The supporting cast is also good with Selma Blair and Luke Wilson leading the bunch. Also in there is 'Waiting...' star Alanna Ubach Matthew Davis Jennifer Coolidge NBC's 'Joey' Ali Larter Victor Garber as Elle's law professor and 'ScoobyDoo' star Linda Cardellini.This is the ultimate 'girl power' movie that every person without a Y chromosome will love. Not all men will like it but I enjoy it whenever it's on television. It's not something I'd buy but one that is a great rent for the whole family. Also a word to the wise watch this one and this one only for the sequel is probably the most disappointing sequel in history.710 spy";

I rarely go to actual movie theaters to see a film I usually rent videosDVDs but I got an advance on this one and I was kind of sad it had to be this film I was going to see but I had been invited along with two other people to see it and I wasn't going to say no for no reason. So I went. One of the persons I went with just wanted to see Reese Witherspoon in a Playboy bunny costume so I figured I was in for another average run'othemill sex comedy. But I was very surprised with the outcome.So many girlpower comedies these days are made just for the sake of trying to prove a point that women are equals to men I suppose that's the message behind itwhat else was Now and Then made for? andor support for women. Fortunately the 2001 hit Legally Blonde is not only a pleasant surprise but an intelligent film as well. Sorry that was my main gripper for this review and I had to leave it in. Reese Witherspoon plays California sorority girl Elle Woods. Unlike other people her age that are worrying about grades in school Elle only worries about what toilet paper is the softest. But after her boyfriend dumps her and goes off to Harvard Law School Elle is determined to go to Harvard and get her man back. So after putting together a very shallow video for the chairmen of Harvard they accept her into the prestige college because of her innocent sexuality no doubt as we see them gaping at Elle in a bathing suit on the video and she packs her bags and heads off to Harvard with her little dog Bruiser as the ads say Boldly Going Where No Blonde Has Gone.Legally Blonde doesn't give up on the plot and completely divulge into dumb blondesex jokes. This film not only has a funnyif ridiculousplot but the jokes are surprisingly NOT crude sexual jokes. This film is not another Scary Movie made for teens It has divinely orchestrated comic timing. Sometimes the plot gets a bit too heavythe whole teacherhittingonElle thing is a bit stereotypical for a film like thisbut in the long run it seems to break away from the typical girlpower comedy.Reese Witherspoon tends to play the same characters a lot but hey if she can pull them off good for her. I don't mind if all her characters tend to be the same to a certain extent because they tend to be quite funny and cutewho can't laugh at her Elle Woods persona? The film has a very nice costar cast Victor Garber Titanic Sleepless in Seattle Luke Wilson Blue Streak Charlie's Angels and Selma Blair The Sweetest Thing A Guy Thingpretty much anyTHING.In the end not only does Legally Blonde come off very funny but also very witty goodnatured and sweet One of the most pleasant surprises of 2001 indeed.45 stars John Ulmer".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't judge a book by it's cover.  An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore.  But it does mean something and it's important and before we proceed go back and read it again.  In fact let me help you  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything take a couple of hours and check out Legally Blonde' a comedy with some real teeth in it directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods Witherspoon who instead of getting the long awaited much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend Warner Matthew Davis finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle it seems just doesn't fit the ohsoserious somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her frivolous' curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing positive beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the serious' of the upper crust' elite.  So because she looks good and enjoys her life Elle is given the gate and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears. With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it she enters Harvard Law herself initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important about the way things really are about people and about herself as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any shallowness' around it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And for the viewer right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest because her triumph whatever it may be or however it comes out is going to be one you share right along with her.Make no mistake this is one funny movie in fact it's downright hilarious at times.  But beyond the laughter it evokes there's a flip side to the same coin.  Because beyond all of the comedy there is some serious issues at the heart of this film and anyone who's ever been subjected to trials and tribulations simply because they didn't happen to fit a certain mold' or coincide with someone else's opinions' of the way things should be will be able to identify with Elle's situation.  And it's something you have to be aware of because even while you're laughing at the funny stuff at the same time it's almost painful to watch Elle endure the senseless heartless unnecessary and unwarranted acts that are perpetrated upon her. At the core of the matter is not only the need for tolerance and understanding but the necessity and importance of keeping an open mind about everything that transpires around you.  Who knows what monumental contributions an individual is capable of making in this imperfect machinery we call society if they are prejudged into oblivion?  So there's a lot more to this film than meets the eye dumb blonde' jokes get nipped in the bud and by using a comedy format the filmmakers here have produced a film that is not only entertaining but thoroughly thoughtprovoking as well.Reese Witherspoon opens herself up and gives a dynamic performance here as Elle she conveys such a fulloflife spirit that it is easy to empathize with her and when the hurt comes you feel it with her.  And through it all the way she takes it on the chin then moves on with her life makes her a role model for those who may find themselves in a similar situation.  On one hand when Elle finds solace by getting a manicure at the local beauty shop it makes for a fallingonthefloor moment of hilarity and yet you're always aware of that other side of the coin as well.  And it makes you root for her all the more.  Witherspoon has a perky vibrant screen presence that makes her perfect for this part and she makes Elle a flawed and therefore very real person.  When she gets knocked down you feel for her and then there's that feeling of triumph when she gets back up and stands her ground. There's no question that this is Witherspoon's movie and it's one of the best performances of her career.The supporting cast includes Luke Wilson Emmett Selma Blair Vivian Victor Garber Professor Callahan Jennifer Coolidge Paulette Holland Taylor Professor Stromwell Ali Larter Brooke TaylorWindham Jessica Cauffiel Margot Linda Cardellini Chutney Alanna Ubach Serena and Oz Perkins Dorky David with a special appearance by Raquel Welch as Mrs. WindhamVandermark.  An entertaining accessible film that should be embraced by a wide audience because of the clever way in which it gets across it's message Legally Blonde' can be enjoyed by just taking it at face value and soaking up the jokes but offers even greater rewards to those who really delve into it and see it as an examination of human nature. Not always but occasionally a movie is so much more than what it appears to be on the surface and this is one of them.  What makes it so good is the fact that it can really make you laugh while at the same time it's subtly telling you that there is no place for cruelty within the realm of human relationships.  It's a film that's worth seeing many times over and that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 910.".

With that wonderful combination of charm and guilelessness Reese Witherspoon has created an endearing character one she's already done a sequel film with.She's nicely aided by Luke Wilson as an attorney and crony of one of her law professors. Another performance that I liked was that of Holland Taylor as a feminist law professor who's initially put off by Witherspoon but gradually comes to appreciate her worth.

	schema:reviewBody "As a middleaged bloke a ditzy frothy blonde who dresses in designer pink and who has as a pet a Chihuahua who also dressed in pink would have me running for the hills screaming and violently pulling out my own fingernails.Unless it's Reese Witherspoon for whom I do have a soft spot for especially when she's exactly like Miss Elle Woods here. The story itself is really rather farfetched but even this aspect is sort of sorted by some generous bending of unwritten rules and smart legal jargon.Legally Blonde will always work better for me when Miss Woods is gaily arranging sorority parties and being just ridiculously OTT about fashion choices and tartly responding when others try and make her look ridiculous. This comic timing is perfectly suited to the bubbly and vibrant Witherspoon and she remains a tonic throughout.The court case that she falls into defending might be essential to the story of how she gets her legal qualifications and to prove all her doubters totally wrong but for me this plays second fiddle to the comedy I mention. The romance angle an essential premise as at the start her boyfriend Warner who she was absolutely sure was going to propose to her dumps her essentially because she's a 'dumb' blonde.He's off to Harvard and so naturally Elle scrapes through the preliminaries with the skimpiest of appropriate qualifications majoring in obscure fashion for example so that he could no longer hold that reason against her. He though is already dating the surly Selma Blair.I've probably seen Legally... three times now. The sequels don't command any great affection for me but this original is one that is both a great comedy and has a real feelgood factor too without resorting to the grossout and toilet humour that's unfortunately seen as an essential ingredient in today's US comedies.".

The main character is extremely likable and you can feel sorry for her plight  once you get over her superficiality she appears to have at the beginning.  I am not usually a fan of such movies but found this one to be acceptable.  Then again maybe it's because I watched the horrible All the pretty horses just before viewing this and anything would have looked good.".

And I enjoyed the acting Reese Witherspoon is really beautiful and charming not to mention funny in the title role while the supporting cast especially Victor Garber and Selma Blair is very nice.Overall this was a surprising film in a good way too. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I love this everything about this movie including its storyline actors actresses and so on. I think this movie is very sweet. Why do I think so? There are some reasons.First of all Reese Witherspoon who is acting the heroine Elle Woods is very cute not only cute but also her fashions are so charming. Secondly I like Elle's character. She is always positive with everything even if she faces serious or difficult situations. My favorite scene is that where Law School students including Elle Elle's old boyfriend Warner and his girlfriend Vivian are taking a class. As Elle's opinion is praised by professor and her opinion is better than Warner's Warner and Vivian look each other with chagrined face. When I saw the scene I felt refreshed and I wanted to say to Elle that You did it Elle!I really like this movie! The storyline all of fashions are cute and actors as well as actresses are suitable for their characters. This movie is not only sweet charming and delightful but also Elle Woods told us that a lot of important things for human's beings. In particular I want many ladies to see this movie but I recommend this movie to to everyone including young boys!!".

	schema:headline " Deep down it's shallow";
	schema:reviewBody "The heroine of this film is Elle Woods an undergraduate studying fashion design at a Californian university. Elle is rather cruelly dumped by her ruthlessly ambitious upperclass boyfriend Warner Huntington III who has just been accepted by Harvard Law School and intends to be a Senator by the time he is 30. Warner considers that Elle is insufficiently serious and intellectual to marry a man like himself as he puts it I need a Jackie not a Marilyn. What Warner fails to consider is that with Marilyn Monroe as a potential First Lady JFK might have been elected by a landslide instead of having to rely on highly contentious results in Illinois and Texas to put him in the White House.Actually Warner's misgivings about Elle seem to have some foundation in reality as she gives the impression of being a shallow superficial airhead concerned about little except her appearance and her clothes. Elle appears to be from a wealthy family I found myself wondering whether her character was modelled on Paris Hilton especially as like Paris she has a pet Chihuahua. Elle however is determined to win Warner back and applies to Harvard Law School herself. Surprisingly she is accepted largely because she impresses the male admissions tutors by wearing a skimpy bikini while making her admission video. Once at Harvard Elle discovers that Warner has now got engaged to Vivian a snobbish upperclass brunette. After a difficult start however she finds herself coping surprisingly well with her academic work wins an internship with a prestigious Boston law firm and even helps to defend Brooke an old college friend charged with murdering her elderly husband.James Berardinelli said of Legally Blonde that it takes a talented performer to make a dumb character likable as opposed to irritating an opinion from which I would not dissent. Reese Witherspoon is of course a very talented performer as evidenced by her welldeserved Oscar for Walk the Line. Even she however and here I would dissent from Mr Berardinelli's view is unable to make Elle a character one can warm to. The script might tell us that beneath Elle's shallow exterior there is a highly intelligent and resourceful individual. Ms Wetherspoon however seemed unable to show us this her demeanour her ridiculously overdone dresssense her constant changes of hairstyle and worst of all her irritatingly highpitched voice only served to reinforce the impression that beneath Elle's shallow exterior was an equally shallow interior.Elle is the sort of character who in the eighties or nineties would have been played by Melanie Griffith the film indeed has certain similarities with Griffith's Born Yesterday another film about a seeminglydumb blonde with hidden depths. Griffith has always struck me as a much less versatile actress than Witherspoon but in Born Yesterday she succeeded where Witherspoon failed making her character Billie Dawn surprisingly likable.Moreover for a film which ostensibly has a don't judge a book by its cover message there was a surprising amount of sexual stereotyping going on. According to this film lesbians are all plain dowdy and politically radical gay men are all camp narcissistic and hysterically overemotional. They also apparently know everything there is to know about fashion designers a subject about which straight men are woefully ignorant. Indeed with the exception of the token good guy who becomes Elle's new boyfriend straight men do not come out of this film any better than gays. Apart from the arrogant and selfobsessed Warner there is a male law professor who turns out to be a creepy sexual predator an unattractive nerd who cannot get a date without Elle's assistance and a poorwhitetrash deadbeat living in of course a rundown old trailer. With the exception of Brooke's oddlynamed stepdaughter Chutney all the female characters are portrayed sympathetically. The formidableseeming female professor turns out to be more decent than her male colleague and even Vivian who is initially portrayed as a social and intellectual snob and a prize bitch goes through a change of heart and becomes Elle's best friend.Legally Blonde is essentially a onejoke film the joke being that although Elle might look dress and behave like a dumb blonde bimbo the sort of girl who as Pamela Stephenson said about Kate Bush needs an intellect like she needs a hole in the head underneath the surface she has hidden qualities not only academic intelligence but also kindness and strength of character. The problem with the film is that unlike its heroine it has no hidden depths. The dialogue is flat the humour is forced and the characters are all stereotypes with whom I could not sympathise. Deep down it's shallow.".

Even though I had that negative thought about her throughout most of the film I thought this film was really funny charming witty and sweet. It was especially funny during the trial of Brooke TaylorWindham Ali Larter. Also even though Elle Reese Witherspoon acted a little crazy at times I thought she did indeed have a lot more legal savvy than she thought she did.

It tries to claim that women are just as powerful and smart as men which I really don't need convincing of but this film actually made me question that idea instead of support it. The only statement that it makes is that women have to manipulate and lie to men in order to succeed. Sure Elle may have gotten into Harvard without doing so which of course is possible but the film makes it seem impossible especially with the stereotypical Harvard students that she meets and cannot manage to get along with. The worst part is that she works so hard to get into Harvard for all the wrong reasons. In the end it tells young women that they can succeed in life even if they live inside of a little bubble that disregards all other life forms even their own pets.I almost ripped my own arms off during the 'bend and snap' scene in which Elle teaches a beauty salon full of women a move that is sure to catch the attention of a nearby man to get him to talk to you. So in a film that is 'more than just another Girl Power Film' the main character teaches other females how to get a man's attention by showing off her breasts and butt. How innovative.I live in Southern California and if I see another dog dressed up and being carried in a purse I am going to move to Sri Lanka. To anyone who thinks that that is cute please see South Park episode 812 which features Paris Hilton's dog committing suicide.In all this film obviously appeals very well to young women and I can maybe even see why many would like it but it also contributes to the growing number of messages the mass media is sending to young women that make me worried about the future. I suppose however if it does encourage young women to aspire to achieve something or inspires them in any way to better themselves then it is a good thing just as long as they aren't going to prove something to their exboyfriend. Do it for yourself what's so hard about that?".

Do it for yourself what's so hard about that?";

It teaches you how to stand for what you want in life and to never give up. What I really like about the movie is that Elle Woods never changes her personality or her being she is the same person and adapts herself to every problem she has so it can be solve in her way classy and chic. It makes girls look powerful not for being girls for the power in the decisions. It make look like a silly movie but it's not. Totally recommended for when you are down and want some inspiration. No more to say about Reese she a queen. The sequel is really good too.".

	schema:reviewBody "That's what William Wyler said about making good pictures and according to him nothing else mattered. And here we have great actors but with a lousy script.First let me note the historical issues that might have caused me to dislike this film it was missing for about eighty years then turned up in the Czech Film Archives about 2000. A video copy was made but it runs at 56 minutes with several cuts that indicate the film broke  I guess Czechoslovakia was the end of the circuit ninety years ago  and the big 'Meet Cute' between Mary Pickford and John Bowers is substantially missing. In addition the original titles are gone with the current English titles being translations from the Czech.Even bearing this in mind this picture is a stinker of a programmer with only a few minutes of Mary's clowning in the middle to relieve the foolishness. Most of this can be blamed on poor writing.For example Mary and her brothers have just landed on the dock at New York where uncle meets them says I'll be right back and is promptly run over by a truck. He's in the hospital for a month. They're succored by a nice lady. When uncle gets out of the hospital a month later there's no sign of worry about what's happened to his Dutch dependents. They don't seem overly upset at his absence either even if they are happy when he finds them because at a news stand right outside the hospital he finds a magazine with a cover drawn by John Bowers' character of Mary Pickford's character.Happens all the time.For another annoyance at the end Mr. Bowers' father is about to be thrown out as president of the railroad unless he can get a right of way from Mary's uncle  he doesn't know the relationship. He wires his estranged son  John Bowers of course  and tells him that if he seduces the niece and gets the uncle to sign the papers he'll remember him in his will. Where this assumption of character came from.....Why was Mary Pickford Paramount's biggest star in such a stinker? Because every time Charlie Chaplin cut a deal for a bigger salary for a studio of his own for his own distribution system Miss Pickford according to her autobiography batted her eyes at Adolph Zukor and got more money. And in order for Paramount to make money on her contract they had to put her in more movies. Paramount would do this over and over again sometimes working their stars to death but more usually turning out so many movies that the public became tired of them  at one point you could find six Marx Brothers movies running simultaneously in Manhattan from the nabes for a dime up to firstrun houses for 50 cents  and no one would pay to see them for fifty cents when you could see them for a dime and so DUCK SOUP tanked.Anyway I digress. The technical aspects of this movie are fine for 1916. No money was spared for the production. The actors do their best. But it's still 90 you need a great script and so this one is a lousy Pickford film. Even in Czech.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another lost film found! 'Hulda from Holland' surfaced in Czechoslovakia's National Film Archive in Prague in 2001. The original credits and intertitles are missing as are several insert shots of handwritten letters and a telegram all replaced with Czech text. Under the guidance of Hugh Munro Neely the Mary Pickford Institute have supplied new English translations of the Czech titles sadly these read like translations from Czech and are surely very different from the original Famous Players intertitles. Many individual frames are deteriorated. The actual 'meet cute' moment  when John Bowers finds Pickford in his rooms  has survived in this print but the sequence that sets this up bringing Pickford into Bowers's rooms is indeed lost. I wish that this print had lost a disgusting and unneeded sequence in which the youngest Dutch boy wallows in jam.SPOILERS THROUGHOUT. Mary Pickford got up here in a woodenshoe Katrinka costume like the Old Dutch Cleanser logo is a Netherlands orphan raising her three younger brothers who look like the Dutch Boy Paints logo. All four have blatant patches on their cozzies so we'll know they're paupers. The boys have no distinct personalities and the youngest is disgustingly twee ... or just disgusting full stop. This story would have worked better with only two younger brothers or even one. All four travel to New York City where she meets Bowers and they fall in love.The plot suffers from two separate coincidences both of them jumbo deluxe. Bowers gives a good performance but his character is that annoying clich the scion of a wealthy family who is offered a solid position in the family firm yet prefers to starve as a sensitive bohemian ... in this case drawing pictures of kittens. I've encountered this trope in dozens of stories and scripts yet I've never accepted it as real. Can't this guy seek the muse at weekends while earning a good living the rest of the week? This time round for once the artist eventually decides to work for his wealthy father after all.Mary Pickford playing here a more mature version of her 'Little Mary' character gives a much better performance than this script deserves. She has several excellent pantomime setpieces and performs them with subtlety and grace.The film benefits from some excellent New York City location shots including one of Pickford's standin encountering the Statue of Liberty and some good period details. A shop advertises prime rib for 12 cents a pound. When a street accident occurs the policeman must summon aid by going into a nearby drugstore to make a phone call.The early scenes set in Holland feature stereotypical costumes with a windmill that I could have sworn was fake. I've now been told by Hugh Neely that this is an authentic windmill near Bridgehampton NY. There's no particular reason why the heroine had to be from Holland nor even an immigrant. This being a silent movie the issue of Dutch girl Hulda's ability to communicate with New Yorkers is never raised.There's an unpleasant and unnecessary scene featuring an unsupervised goat that dies from poisoning. The poor kid had no nanny.This is one of those movies in which the railway tycoons urgently covet some poor farmer's land. For once this plot gimmick is resolved intelligently. Apparently in this case there's no law of eminent domain to force the sale. There's some originality in 'Hulda from Holland' but also two very long coincidences some clichs and that disgusting little boy. Mary Pickford's excellent performance wellsupported by John Bowers raises this movie to 6 out of 10.".

This is stylized Harlem guys.I do not think Murphy set out to break ground plotwise. Its meant to be a very traditional good vs. bad mobster movie. In this rare case we get to see the other side of tracks version. Why not??This movie is a rare joining of a classic team of talents including Richard Pryor Della Reese and Red Foxx.

This is stylized Harlem guys.I do not think Murphy set out to break ground plotwise. Its meant to be a very traditional good vs. bad mobster movie. In this rare case we get to see the other side of tracks version. Why not??This movie is a rare joining of a classic team of talents including Richard Pryor Della Reese and Red Foxx. Della was my favorite and her rapport with Foxx is classic.";

	schema:reviewBody "The most common thing critics said to trash Harlem Nights was that it was too profane to be set in 1938. Well this statement here was completely without logic. Two points to back myself up1. In almost every 1930's40's50's gangster movie the charactersare very profane. Look at any movie directed by Martin Scorcese and starring Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci for evidence of this2. What do you expect from a movie starring Richard Pryor Eddie Murphy and Redd Foxx? If you expect these three men to watch their language you are truly a stranger in the ways of their materialAs for the movie's sexist feel I cannot dispute this. However I can defend it. I am not a sexist young man despite being onlytwentyone years of age. I feel that women should have the same rights as men. However I think Eddie Murphy was young and dumb and only felt the way he did because he was not mature enough to understand women. Now he is happily married and expecting his fifth child so I think he is a little wiser today.As for one review I read that said every white man was a bigot in this movie. Guys come on it's Harlem in 1938!Despite all of this the movie is a wellmade wellcharacterized entertaining film. It was taken too seriously when it was first released and I'm glad many people here seem to agree with me.The plot concerns Sugar Ray Pryor who was sadly the only disappointing performer here and his adopted son Vernest Brown a.k.a. Quick Murphy owners of the hottest nightclub in Harlem. It becomes the target of gangster Bugsy Calhoune an impressive performance by Michael Learner and his buddy Sgt. Phil Cantone A terrific Danny Aiello. They plot with their employees to scam him out of his money by placing a fake bet on a boxing match and leave Harlem.The movie is not without plot holes and the occasional bad line of dialogue but other than that it's funny and entertaining. A particular highlight are Foxx's nearsighted Bennie Wilson and Reese's Vera Walker who exchange profane banter throughout the film which is hilarious. A cameo by longtime Murphy friend Arsenio Hall whom I usually dislike as a crybaby mobster is also very funny. Don't listen to the critics this movie is funny as hell!".

	schema:reviewBody "...Thats right the best. This movie was a hallmark for standup comedy. For the first time you had all the greats in one movie Eddie Murphy Richard Pryor Redd Foxx Robin Harris. Especially since the last 2 have passed away and Richard Pryor is too ill to do a movie again. When he made Nights he had to sit in his wheelchair when he wasn't filming hence you never see him do anything physical in the movie. I first saw this movie one I was 10 with my dad uncles and my grandmother. Of course she was turned off by the profanity but we all were laughing untill our sides hurt. I also remember all the things the great voices of cinema said about this movie. And to that i say how can you look down at this movie for profanity and praise movies like Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction great movies by the way when they have twice the vulgar langauge. And to those that say well why did they portray the white mobsters as the bad guys? Well its Harlem in the 30's and ask any black person who owned a place of buisness then how hard it was. To me this wasn't just about Eddie Eddie Eddie this was an epic for comedy and I hate to use the clinche but Black movies as well. The only other Murphy movie that comes close is Nutty Professer. I hope the sequel to that is half as funny as Nights. One last point that I think why critics panned this movie is we all now Eddie is a comic genuis but people were so use to seeing him play to a white partner or sidekick i.e. Trading Places All the Beverly Hill Cops and 48 Hours But to a comedy standup fan like me Murphy Pryor Foxx Hall Harris in one movie was like giving a Star Wars fan as I am premire tickets to Ep. 2  3. If you haven't seen this I recommend it just for the fact that half the cast had passed on and this was their last work but its also a fun take on the mobster movie craze of the 30's and 40's.".

With gambling music and dancing and lots of ladies for company Sugar's sees it's fair share of good business and more.Eddie Murphy stars as his son Mr. Quick and together the two of them run a business like no other.

Bugsy has his fair share of establishments and doesn't appreciate the business he loses to Ray. Enter Danny Aiello as crooked cop Phil Cantone and the plot twists and thickens until you wonder who is deceiving who. Stand up hilarious banter between Della Reese and Redd Foxx will keep you in stitches until the very end of the movie. Della Reese is knockdown dragout funny as the wise talking tough as nails but tender hearted Vera Walker who keeps the ladies for Ray at Sugar Ray's and Redd Foxx will split your sides as Bennie Wilson as he runs or rather tries to run the gambling tables. He just has one problem he can't see what's in front of him!Add an entertaining performance by Arsenio Hall as The Crying Man and you have a non stop action movie that will tickle your funny bone and have you wishing you could have seen Harlem in its glory days.I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes their movies with glam glitz comedy and some of the most rapid quips and comebacks ever to grace the silver screen!".

He just has one problem he can't see what's in front of him!Add an entertaining performance by Arsenio Hall as The Crying Man and you have a non stop action movie that will tickle your funny bone and have you wishing you could have seen Harlem in its glory days.I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes their movies with glam glitz comedy and some of the most rapid quips and comebacks ever to grace the silver screen!";

Eddie Murphy the decades biggest star faced heavy criticism for not breaking ground for black filmmakers and actors until he included a predominantly black cast in 1988's Coming to America. And now with the Black Film Renaissance in full swing Murphy wanted to direct. 1989's Harlem Nights was Murphy's first and last foray into filmmaking. Harlem Nights is a period piece set in 1938 Harlem. Sugar Ray Richard Pryor and Quick Murphy are owners of an illegal casino and they're being chased out of business by rival gangsters and corrupt police. The cast which included the likes of Murphy along with Pryor Redd Foxx Robin Harris Della Reese and a then unknown Charlie Murphy is stellar. With all this comedic talent in one film you'd expect a lot more laughter. The film is hilarious but Pryor's role is limited as far as comedy goes. With all these comedy legends you'd expect to be bleeding internally from laughter. That is probably the only flaw in this film. Aside from the comedy the films set decoration and wardrobe puts you in the prohibition era and led to its Academy Award nomination.

He certainly got his casting spot on with a host of character actors in main roles and casting Richar Pryor alongside himself as the stars.The film takes place in stylised Harlem of the 1930's as two small time crooks make a living running a night club but success soon brings the big time crooks calling can our hero's make it out alive and in profit? The film looks stylish and the direction soaks up the lavish elegance of the period and it's refreshing to see black characters represented in a period film as more than token characters. I think where this films slight problem rises is that it tries to bridge two genres the straight gangster movie and the comedy movie. Overall its a good film and I think it's a shame Murphy hasn't stepped into the directors role again.Pretty good 710".

All people are living frivolous and in some ways inspiring lives of daredevil antics and blithe lifestyles. Then as the title so perceptively puts it an earthquake hits L.A. causing reckless mayhem to the buildings and petrifying danger to city inhabitants. But the story doesn't stop there. There are many quakes and plenty of danger to go around and that is where the story takes flight. The focus of this film is not the quake itself but how it affects the people of L.A. The film being extremely Hollywood drivennote the allstar cast menacing sensurround effect might appear to be presented as a top of the league disaster film of the trend which was popular at the time and special effects driven and it might have been but there are also many artistic qualities to be found here. One has to examine it first. The scariest thing about this film is that it is plausible though not probable. The other disaster films at the time were all man made disastersboats upsidedowning Fire spreading through out a sky scraper but Earthquake was the first disaster film to show a disaster that might actually happen and present characters that people can relate to in such a treacherous situation. These are real people and most of them are affected in ways beyond psychological apprehension. But director Robson still manages to make it a fun and enjoyable film without making the situations seem too grim.The characters could all be discussed in a psychology class to be analyzed even as each one has hisher own story to tell. However one of the main characters the quake itself gets credit too. As there are two jolts the big quake and then an unexpected aftershock to boot there is more than enough rumble to go around. The rumble though is lasting through out the characters minds as each one goes a little crazy after the shake be it irrational or rational as there are many different types of people in society. There is parallel destruction going on as well. As the city is torn apart so are these people and the way they view life as one character loses it and blows away some fellow roommates who have mistreated him while others are healed as a Sgt. who is a drunk and louse who shapes up and becomes really responsible after the quake. These specifications may or may not be apprehensive to the average audience and true opinion is opinion but Earthquake is a good film that demonstrates how we as a society have allowed for far too long the deterioration of our world and all that affects it. This world is not a toy it needs to be taken care of and when we as a society are mean to itand each other for that matter mother nature strikes back at us.Be it a big Hollywood Blockbuster or social commentary which ever you choose this film is a great and overlooked gem in Hollywood history and an interesting one to read up onthe special effects were outstanding and won a well deserved Oscar and study in film classes. Great performances by all as well. Mario Puzo wrote the precursor to the Superman earthquake with this one and Mark Robson has a guilty pleasure tone to his directing. Great fun.".

Great performances by all as well. Mario Puzo wrote the precursor to the Superman earthquake with this one and Mark Robson has a guilty pleasure tone to his directing. Great fun.";

Since movie studios didn't have the resources in 1974 to add expensive computerized effects miniatures camera trickery and a few largescale destructions were used to simulate the quake. However even by today's standards most but not all effects work pretty well. Many of the buildings we see crumbling to the ground are actual locals in Los Angeles and anyone who ever lived is this area myself included would still find watching this film chilling to say the least. The sets are very impressive  they made one helluva mess of Universal Studios making this film. The acting is soso and the ending is disappointing and leaves us with a lot of unanswered questions what ever happened to Miles and Rosa's brother anyway? And the scenes with Jody the weirdo are just plain uncomfortable. But as far as pure end of the world disaster entertainment goes this film has it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "What can I say about Earthquake that hasn't already been said before? A cast that includes Charlton Heston Ava Gardner Lorne Greene Genevieve Bujold George Kennedy and Victoria Principal head this great story of Los Angeles and the lives that are affected by those who live their after a tremor registers at 71! The lives and lifestyles of these people some pleasant and some not are put to the test as they are forced to deal with the cause and effect of having a thriving city on tectonic plates that are rapidly moving. A gem of a film ridiculed to no end because of varying opinions that should not matter to one of those inquiring minds! Ugh! And they say smoking is bad for you. People need to open their minds and see. See that this film is not half as bad as most say it is. True this film is a big Hollywood monopoly fest and their are no unknowns to be seen as you have Charlton HestonBenHur Ava GardnerMGM actress Genevieve BujoldAnne of a Thousand Days among others and even costars as Richard RoundtreeShaft and Victoria PrincipalDallas. The cast works really well together and the print shines.There are a lot of facts explored here such as animals crying out or running away moments before the quakes that really give chills out of the reality of it. These are the really great things that happen and give excitement not artificial scares made up for the ongoing monopoly that this film has such a reputation for but rather realistic knowledge that shows what might happen would such a quake strike the earth at such force. Also of note are the scenes with the dam and the water rising after each preshock while a man falls out of an elevator full of water drowned from it. Great sets as well. Many sets are being torn apart in the quake scenes while maintaining the reality of sets the tone. The effects which won a very deserved Oscar are what really opens the audience's eyes. We see the valley we see Capital Records we see Wilshire and even Zsa Zsa Gabor's bushes get totally eschewed during the disaster. What is really amazing is that such matting and blue screen was put to use that to this day I still scratch my head on how it was all done. It would really be nice to see a featurette on how they did it all. Those scenes in which there is an after shock show millions of people running from a huge building that is literally falling to pieces before our very eyes! Amazing stuff. There is truly beauty in this film when looked for. An event... as the tagline reads is right. Every one knows earthquakes cause damage but how much damage is seen? It was amazing to see Los Angeles fall to pieces and show the rest of the world what it would be like were a 7.1 ricter scale.Equally great is the Mario Puzo script. The first thing that drew me to this film was how well it pulls the audience into the drama between the characters. Think in recent films Magnolia meets Volcano. The relationship between Heston and Gardner while can be laughable due to the nature of two divas facing off is still capable of being appreciated. George Kennedy as a worn out cop plays strictly for drama and even though he is inter cut with Walter Matthau as a sleazy barman cameo he gets some seriousness for himself in the end. The structure of the film from the setting up of the characters some funlike Principal as Rosa Amici with her friend Roundtree as a daredevil or characters that you can relate toBujold is great as aspiring actress. As for the development of the disaster itself the way the tremors start as small and then the big shake and then the after shock builds really well and the characters with their emotional baggage and structured emotions deep intertwine and create a great story that is fun for all.Sensurround was a fast growing mechanism used in films and was fully extent in this one. Many people see this technique as the only reason this film was made and yes this was a big Hollywood picture made for monopoly purposes but there was art in it from the artists who those big wigs hired.There is a really good film here and it still stands to this day. Great score by John Williams and there is a website you can go to to further understand the film as it is. In the end even though the reviews have not given this film the justice it deserved the loyal filmmakers that appreciate art and the joy of dedication and filmmaking have kept this film where it belongs with the reputation it deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sensurround!  How I do miss it!  How this movie misses it!  It was the best thing it had going for it when it was released in special theaters with sound equipment designed to vibrate your fanny as it sat snugly in those theater seats.   Unfortunately without the vibrations Earthquake just ain't as much fun.As disaster films go Earthquake is certainly not the worst but is far from the best.  Charlton Heston fresh from having saved a 747 from certain disaster in Airport 1975 now does his best to save the city of Los Angeles. To be fair though we knew he wasn't going to stop the earthquake leaving that for Christopher Reeve in Superman some years later.  But we just knew that as Construction Engineer Stewart Graff he'd do his best to save a lot of L.A. citizens stuck in precarious situations.  Why else would he be here? And just for fun he even brought George Kennedy over from Airport 1975 with him although he's a cop named Lew Slade now instead of tinkering around with jetliners.  What a treat!It seems that Lew Slade was chasing a bad guy who had been drunk driving and run down a kid.  Unfortunately the bad guy crashes his vehicle right on the property of Zsa Zsa Gabor which is out of Slade's jurisdiction.  When another officer who is in the proper jurisdiction berates Slade for messing up Miss Gabor's shrubbery Slade let's the young officer know how much he cares about plant life by landing a right cross.  This lands him a suspension and supposedly helps us get to know his character a little better while we pat our foot waiting for the big rumble to start. Did you really think they were going to open a disaster film with the actual disaster?  There's a code in the screenwriter's handbook that says that's not allowed.  At least that's what I'm told.Meanwhile somewhere else in L.A. Stuart Graff is married to Remy RoyceGraffAva Gardner who was fathered by Sam RoyceLorne Greene when he was seven I think.  Sam is also Stuart's Boss.  Stuart is having an affair with Denise MarshallGenevieve Bujold who happens to be the widow of a former coworker of Stuart.  We are not told whether Stuart had anything to do with the death of Denise's husband so he could put the moves on her but they could have added that to the plot too.  Generally in these types of films they throw everything in but the kitchen sink anyway so why not?Then on the other side of town we have motorcycle daredevil Miles QuadeRichard Roundtree along with partner Sal AmiciGabriel Dell getting ready to put on the show of his life.  His sister is Rosa AmiciVictoria Principal before Dallaswho has about the funkiest curly hairdo I think I've ever seen on film.  Think Shirley Temple with coal black hair.  Then there's supermarket manager weekend warrior JodyMarjoe Gortnerwho happens to be a fanatic about women with curly coal black naturally curly hair as you'll soon discover.  Now all this might sound interesting on paper and might make a good soapopera. In this film it's all useless information since this is a film about an earthquake and after it hits we could care less about what happens up to that point.  Think of it as the filler before the thriller.Even without the oscillating seats the earthquake itself is still fun to watch.  We get skyscrapers crashing to the ground buildings falling on people shards of glass piercing the good citizen's skins people scalded by stoves houses explode freeways cave in Stuart Remy and Sam get trapped in a high rise a bar comes crashing down around Lew Miles big motorcycle stunt comes crashing down Rosa loses her popcorn in a movie theater Denise's son takes a dive on his bike and good boy Jody gets to put his uniform on and show us just how psychotic and messed up he really is. This is cool stuff folks even for 1974 type special effects.  Unfortunately the Earthquake momentarily subsides and we are left to deal with some of the silly plotting the film started out with.  Guess you can't have everything.If you can overlook the usual silliness and terrible dialog which seems to go with the territory in disaster films you might be entertained by some close calls and daring rescues after the earthquake.  You'll certainly get a few laughs out of Marjoe Gortner's crackedup soldier performance.  George Kennedy is pretty darn good as the cop.  Heston is better than he was in that Airport thingy and though his romance with Bujold is an obvious mismatch it doesn't come near to equaling the absurdity of his relationship with Karen Black on that 747.  Ava Gardner plays the bitchy Remy as if she were competing for the Shrew Olympics.  Lorne Greene looks as if he wishes he was back on the Ponderosa with Hoss Adam and Little Joe.  Richard Roundtree is fun as the daredevil but we see little of him after the earthquake.  Tiger Williams as Denise's son Corry spends most of the film unconscious and we are grateful for that.  Usually the kids in disaster films are scripted to be overly cute and annoying.  I think there's a rule in the screenwriter's disaster film handbook about that too.If I have one suggestion to make it would be avoid the version of this film with the added TV footage at all costs.  For those of you familiar with Welcome Back Kotter if you see any footage of  Rosalie 'Hotzie' TotzieDebralee Scottriding an airplane change the channel remove the tape just do what you have to do.  Why this goofy footage was ever added is beyond me.In it's original form my grade for Mark Robson wiping out L.A. C Hotzie Totzie gets an F and it's back to the sweat hogs for her.".

I grew up with various westerns and others and one film in particular I remember well is the classic King Kong.Critics who knock this film must remember that 1974 was a transitional period where techniques were still being learned. Without the benefit of computers I might add. When you have grown up with computer wizardry that is since the start of the seventies it it far easier to find fault than to see the merit in what these people achieved.However with the passage of time one realizes the major fault with this film was the poor casting. This should not detract from the efforts of the special effects people. They have led the way and shown the young people coming along what can be done with skill and imagination. 310 for casting 610 for special effects.".

At this time most are probably seeing Earthquake on AMC. This is a bloated version that one of the networks NBC? cobbled together in the mid70s when it first showed Earthquake on TV. My recollection from almost 30 years ago mind you is that the network added a lot of poorlydone footage specifically the entire subplot with the interminable scenes of the newlywed couple on the airplane!. It wanted to broadcast the movie as a big twonight ratings extravaganza but messed it up by adding airplane! scenes that were boring cheap and cheesy. Not that the movie is all that great in any version but in its original form it was tighter and had better production values.Watching the AMC NBC? version recently I am reminded that the network did a horrible editing job. Early on the airplane! is passing over a smoggy and uninspiring Grand Canyon en route to LA with an ETA of what 45 or 50 minutes? Cut back to the original LA scenes where Charlton Heston goes through enough experiences involving his career and love life to occupy several ordinary days and is leaving the office when the earthquake starts. Sometime later we cut back to the airplane! which is just landing in LA at this point. The airplane! scenes look as though they were filmed for about 500 with talent that should have stuck with doing deodorant ads. The rest of the movie isn't too bad although as '70s disaster movies go I much prefer The Poseidon Adventure.".

	schema:headline " The Actual Earthquake Was Pretty Good  Otherwise We Wait  And Wait";
	schema:reviewBody "To give credit where credit is due  those special effects people managed to put together a pretty good depiction of this massive earthquake that strikes Los Angeles. And it goes on and on for quite a long time. And buildings collapse and houses explode as gas lines break and a massive dam is threatened and people are buried in the debris and they tumble to their deaths or the elevator that they're on crashes down and ... and ... and ... By the standards of 1970's special effects that was really well done. Unfortunately you also have to sit through the rest of the movie which ... well ... ain't so well done!We get almost an hour of soapish type filler before the actual earthquake hits. Yes I know that's mandatory in these kinds of films. It's as if somebody in the 1970's decided that adding all these personal subplots about the characters would make viewers more interested maybe we'd get to know the characters and their lives better and we'd care more. Uh. No. I just really wanted to get to the earthquake and its aftermath. I didn't really care who was having an affair with who or any of the other numerous subplots that got going in that first hour  although it was rather fun to watch one cop punch out another in an apparent dispute over jurisdiction and  believe it or not  Zsa Zsa Gabor's hedge not that she makes an appearance. Basically I spent almost an hour thinking can't we just get to the earthquake. Please. PLEASE! And then it comes  and it's great and it lasts for a few minutes  and then it's over and we get back into many of those soapish subplots through which we see the aftermath of the earthquake. This was perhaps a little more interesting than the leadup. For example although it wasn't graphically depicted I was a bit surprised to see a movie from this era depict a soldier apparently trying to rape a young woman. But really  the movie had telegraphed for a long time that the real suspense was going to eventually come from the dam bursting and how many were going to be saved and who was going to die as a result. So in that second part of the movie we waited for that to happen. There was a lot of waiting for things to happen in this movie.This had a decent cast. These 70's disaster movies always seemed to be able to attract well known names and even a few truly big stars. Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner are in this for example. There were secondary movie stars like George Kennedy and Walter Matthau in an inexplicably and totally unnecessary role as a drunk at a bar who basically just wants another drink no matter what's happening around him. There was Lorne Greene much better known for his TV work as Ben Cartwright in Bonanza. And there was Victoria Principal still a few years away from TV stardom as Pam Ewing on Dallas as the almost rape victim  who I didn't even recognize as she was made up in this really far out curly sort of hairstyle. I had seen her name in the credits and was actually looking for her and didn't recognize her until the closing credits revealed which character she was. I had to go back and look. Now  knowing her character  I could recognize her.Some of those 1970's disaster type movies are a lot of fun and pretty well done. I'd say this one doesn't exactly rank at the top or even near the top of that list. But the actual earthquake is fun. No doubt about that. 310".

So in that second part of the movie we waited for that to happen. There was a lot of waiting for things to happen in this movie.This had a decent cast. These 70's disaster movies always seemed to be able to attract well known names and even a few truly big stars. Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner are in this for example. There were secondary movie stars like George Kennedy and Walter Matthau in an inexplicably and totally unnecessary role as a drunk at a bar who basically just wants another drink no matter what's happening around him. There was Lorne Greene much better known for his TV work as Ben Cartwright in Bonanza. And there was Victoria Principal still a few years away from TV stardom as Pam Ewing on Dallas as the almost rape victim  who I didn't even recognize as she was made up in this really far out curly sort of hairstyle. I had seen her name in the credits and was actually looking for her and didn't recognize her until the closing credits revealed which character she was. I had to go back and look. Now  knowing her character  I could recognize her.Some of those 1970's disaster type movies are a lot of fun and pretty well done. I'd say this one doesn't exactly rank at the top or even near the top of that list. But the actual earthquake is fun. No doubt about that. 310";

Richard Rountree was on hand solely to provide some color thus his role could have been called heroic Negro on motorcycle. A poor letdown for such an actor that had flaunted his AfricanAmerican masculinity so well in the series of Shaft films.Obviously Walter Matthau was smart enough to have his contribution to this turkey uncredited.Even John Williams' score seems to be recycled from his composition for both of Allen's films.".

Although it takes a little under an hour to get to the big event most similar movies only take about twenty it doesn't seem like this  director Mark Robson and screenwriters Mario The Godfather Puzo and George Fox actually Fox was brought in to simplify Puzo's original screenplay because it was too complicated to film skillfuly weave to storylines together to form a cohesive cast that is now cliched simply because it was one of the movies that set the trend.  Anyway the actual earthquake itself is SPECTACULAR. Without the use of todays computer wizardry the effects are chilling excpet the bit with the blood flying at the camera.  It utilises both live action in camera effects models and a combination of both.  In the process of leveling Los Angeles the crew managed to all but destroy the Universal Back lot where much of the exterior's were filmed.  A multimillion dollar model of LA was destroyred convincingly and now stands in the preride experience at the film's ride in Universal Escape Florida.  The initial aftermath is convinving Albert Whitlock one of the most respected VFX people in the industry created countless matte paintings of destoryed LA that when combined with the live action shots and fires look stunning.  SPOILER!!!! LOOK AWAY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING!!!!! The scene with survivors sheltering in the basement shopping levels of the supposedly earthquake proof Wilson Plaza being buried alive in an aftershock is... WOW!  It uses a complicated combination of live action stunts preshot sections of the mall collapsing around our ears then matted in and blue screen shots of people falling from height to create the illusion of the huge mall collpasing along with a stampede of people running from the buildings as it collapses.  The finale of the collapse of the Hollywood Reservoir Dam is one of the best sequences in movie history ir is also one of the strangest in such event movies.  Charlton Heston didn't like the ending he was given and asked for it to be changed.  Much to Robson's protests Heston had script approval and so when his bitchy wife Ava gardner gets swept away by flood waters he chooses to rescue her and in the process the two of them die leaving the sexy Genevieve Bujold who played Hestons mistress alone.  A very downbeat ending which even John Williams end titles expresses with none of the triumphant music he used in the endings of The Poseidon Advenutre and The Towering Inferno which he also scored.  Indeed the last line in the film is This used to be a hell of a town officer. All in all this is a superb movie that still looks good along with The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno.".

	schema:headline " Better than its reputation actually better than Towering and Airport";
	schema:reviewBody "As being fascinated by 70s disaster movies I kept scores on the ratings of films such as Airport Towering Inferno Poseidon adventure and ...Earth Quake. I heard negative things about the latter one and the scores on IMDb indicate likewise. When I by chance found a DVDcopy of this film in a bargain bin for a very low price I reasoned that the price was affordable enough given its bad repute. Therefore I was surprised to be quite bitten by the movie almost instantly after the initial credits were rolling. In terms of production values I judge Earthquake at least as professional and detailed as Towering inferno if not even more realistic. Those who actually live in L.A. perhaps now how they faked the geography etc but the film does manage to draw the spectator in the scenery and create a certain realistic presence. The effects of the Towering Inferno were actually cheesier this goes especially for the skyscrapers scenes which are definitely more convincing here than in Towering. Maybe the extras used for the hospital scenes are a bit too rehearsed for the next surpise after shelve but this is also the case in most other disaster flicks.Plot wise then and in narration it has perhaps some shortcomings there is not a definite apocalyptic climax and the end may to certain spectators appear to be somewhat sudden although I actually felt that it offered some moral logic. Because as is the case for all true big Hollywood disaster flicks from the era the story is actually a pretext for supplying oldfashioned morality lessons in an era that had already ceded to sins and secularity. All sinners get theirs here but I noted that the film spares noone the extremist weapons fetishist as well as the middle class adulterer will meet their horrific destiny. One may almost call this cynicism because the inner moral voice of this film does not appear to have taken a rightist or leftist side. It is rather resigned and worldweary. Once again an interesting comparison to Towering can be made since Towering on the surface takes on a more middleclass leftist approach where Paul Newman as center of moral gravity the angry and aware intellectual. Here the corresponding character is perhaps George Kennedy's antihero the tired copper who does not carry moral cookies in his pockets but on the other hand acts humanly to those in need. The same moody resignation you will find in the way the marriage between Ava and Charlton is presented a sad failure they don't hate it each other he just cannot find any ounce of feeling for his alcoholic middle aged wife. So when it comes to characterization I would definitely give Earthquake a higher score than both Towering and Airport which are dominated by more shallowly drawn characters.Speaking about score finally the lovers of John Williams will be satisfied his strings are used effectively here. As always I have many more things to say requiring many thousands of words more but I stop here to not get tedious.".

	onyx:emotionText "As being fascinated by 70s disaster movies I kept scores on the ratings of films such as Airport Towering Inferno Poseidon adventure and ...Earth Quake. I heard negative things about the latter one and the scores on IMDb indicate likewise. When I by chance found a DVDcopy of this film in a bargain bin for a very low price I reasoned that the price was affordable enough given its bad repute. Therefore I was surprised to be quite bitten by the movie almost instantly after the initial credits were rolling. In terms of production values I judge Earthquake at least as professional and detailed as Towering inferno if not even more realistic. Those who actually live in L.A. perhaps now how they faked the geography etc but the film does manage to draw the spectator in the scenery and create a certain realistic presence. The effects of the Towering Inferno were actually cheesier this goes especially for the skyscrapers scenes which are definitely more convincing here than in Towering. Maybe the extras used for the hospital scenes are a bit too rehearsed for the next surpise after shelve but this is also the case in most other disaster flicks.Plot wise then and in narration it has perhaps some shortcomings there is not a definite apocalyptic climax and the end may to certain spectators appear to be somewhat sudden although I actually felt that it offered some moral logic.

	schema:reviewBody "This charming little Bmovie tells the story of Seymour Jonathon Haze a good hearted yet rather slow boy who works at a flower shop owned by Gravis Mushnick Mel Welles. During his spare time Seymour develops a new type of plant which he names Audrey Junior after a woman he likes Jackie Joseph. Unfortunately this particular plant feeds off human blood and when Seymour can no longer feed it on his blood the plant itself forces him to look elsewhere for food.This delightful horrorcomedy was remarkably shot in just two days and was originally intended as a sequel to director Roger Corman's Bucket of Blood' 1959. However The Little Shop of Horrors' stands out in its own right as a charming and inventive lowbudget horror movie. Throughout the movie we meet a whole variety of weird and wonderful characters including a man who eats plants played by Dick Miller who would also work with Jackie Joseph in Gremlins' 1984 a sadistic dentist a masochistic dental patient an early performance from Jack Nicholson and a woman who can't go a day without a family member passing on. Despite or maybe because of the overall absurdity of the movie The Little Shop of Horrors' manages to be strangely captivating yet portray an air of darkness in the right places.Roger Corman directed this movie very well considering his resources and complimented the fairly tight screenplay written by Charles Griffith. The special effects were not of that high a standard but considering the budget and shooting time one can hardly have anything negative to say about that. The appearance of the plant as it grows throughout the movie may not be that great but overall it takes nothing away from the viewers enjoyment. Perhaps a little bit more could have been done to represent the plants movement more realistically but even so this is just a minor flaw of an otherwise great film. The performance from the three main stars was delightful. Though the acting was hammed up in places the movie never lost its comical charm and some slightly dramatic performances towards the end helped create an unsuspected eeriness in the dying moments.Surprisingly The Little Shop of Horrors' was virtually ignored on its initial release but eventually attained a cult status due to continuous TV play. For those of you who doubt its classic status The Little Shop of Horrors' has now spawned a Broadway musical a highbudget musical remake and even a Saturday morning children's TV programme. Short around 68mins but very entertaining I recommend this to fans of quirky horror comedies and general horror fans alike! The movie features good direction a well written story interesting and likeable characters and some excellent oneliners. My rating for The Little Shop of Horrors' 810.".

Business is not great in fact it is awful  nobody wants to buy flowers when they can't be sure where their next meal is coming from. However the cleaning boy has nurtured a strange new plant up from seed and it seems to be getting interest. When he discovers it needs a few drops of blood to make it grow Seymour is the toast of the town with his employer very grateful for the increased revenue the visitors bring. However as it grows it begins to need more than a few drops and soon he is heading down a terrible dark road.Like many viewers I suspect I came to this film after seeing the musical remake as such I assumed that this would be a straight film in the bmovie genre that Corman is famous for. However I was taken by how amusing this film was because really this is as much a horror comedy as the musical is. From Seymour's alcoholic mother to the cop so hard that even the death of his son is met with a shrug the whole film is full of darkly comic touches that drew some nice laughs from me. This comic approach helps the film because really it is a silly plot and the fact that the script was tongueincheek meant it was easier to swallow if you pardon the choice of words. As a horror it doesn't really work but it does have a slocky property that Corman films tend to have  not high quality but low budget bmovie fun.The cast match the material and all buy into the joke watching them also shows that the cast in the musical are really pretty much just impersonate the actors here. Haze is enjoyably geeky and convinces throughout. Welles is funny and plays up to his ethnic caricature well. Corman regular Miller hasn't really got much to do but his face is always a ruggedly familiar and welcome sight. Joseph is not great but her performance suits the bmovie genre  likewise Campo and Warford who are very funny as Dragnet style cops. Nicholson is pretty funny and was a curious find in a small cameo.Overall this is not a great film but it is a great bmovie horror. Never taking itself seriously means that it can be darkly funny and take the audience along for the ride. To me it is just as funny as the musical even it is a different type of humour and it is worth checking out.".

	schema:headline " I lurve this movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Funny sexy black comedy shot by King of the B's Roger Corman on a landmark budget of 27 000 and in landmark time of only 2 days! Its the funniest movie i've seen from 1960 or before and between this fact the fact that it is black comedy and the fact that it has the charm  and lack of pretension of a cheaply made horror movie its no wonder it has such a huge cult following.It has the incredibly sexy Jackie Joseph one of the most buxom lasses i've ever seen and many risque scenes which along with the jazzy soundtrack and black humour give this a much freer feel than any studio picture of the era or any picture before. Its humour hasn't aged a bit  and feels quite modern compared to most humour of the day.As an added curio this features Jack Nicholson in his first ever appearance in a feature film he was in one short film before it as the nerdy masochistic patient who squeals with delight when the dentist is drilling holes in his mouth and pulling teeth. Though its only a five minute part its a great part.The movie is filled with an edgy humour that the remakes including the broadway musical which the 1986 film was based on are too conservative for. I thoroughly recommend it to you.Corman went on to become one of the most important producers of the century since he provided opportunities to many young filmmakers in the 70's whose projects the major studios would never have invested in and so we would have been deprived of the talents of Peter Bogdanovich Francis Ford Coppola The Godfather Apocalypse Now Martin Scorcese Taxi Driver Raging Bull Jonathan Demme Silence of the Lambs and many others.

	onyx:emotionText "Funny sexy black comedy shot by King of the B's Roger Corman on a landmark budget of 27 000 and in landmark time of only 2 days! Its the funniest movie i've seen from 1960 or before and between this fact the fact that it is black comedy and the fact that it has the charm  and lack of pretension of a cheaply made horror movie its no wonder it has such a huge cult following.It has the incredibly sexy Jackie Joseph one of the most buxom lasses i've ever seen and many risque scenes which along with the jazzy soundtrack and black humour give this a much freer feel than any studio picture of the era or any picture before. Its humour hasn't aged a bit  and feels quite modern compared to most humour of the day.As an added curio this features Jack Nicholson in his first ever appearance in a feature film he was in one short film before it as the nerdy masochistic patient who squeals with delight when the dentist is drilling holes in his mouth and pulling teeth. Though its only a five minute part its a great part.The movie is filled with an edgy humour that the remakes including the broadway musical which the 1986 film was based on are too conservative for. I thoroughly recommend it to you.Corman went on to become one of the most important producers of the century since he provided opportunities to many young filmmakers in the 70's whose projects the major studios would never have invested in and so we would have been deprived of the talents of Peter Bogdanovich Francis Ford Coppola The Godfather Apocalypse Now Martin Scorcese Taxi Driver Raging Bull Jonathan Demme Silence of the Lambs and many others. Corman taught them how to just go out and make a good movie and make it cheaply  and his major qualification to be able to teach them this in my opinion is that he made Little Shop of Horrors.";

It was one of those local celebrity things with an emcee presiding over whatever horror movies were in the library of that particular station. I realized quickly what an offbeat flick this was. It was utterly hilarious with its moments of masochism the man eating plant Audrey one and two and all the other things that Seymour must deal with just to keep going. The plant controls him and it is a hilarious plant. The black and white neutral staging of the plant is so much better than the flashiness of the musical though I do like some of those songs. The smallness of this film is what helps make it work. Everyone is a caricature. Jack Nicholson's proudest moment. No wonder he is such a wack spending all that time in his formative years with Roger Corman. The acting works because it is a period piece. No matter how much we try to reproduce the fifties it always falls short of just seeing the fifties. It's like Dragnet without the strange suits and the slang of the time. It's just more honest because they weren't trying to reproduce it. I haven't watched this in some time so I think I'll leave my computer and sit down and watch it again.".

Corman semiregular Jonathan Haze may not be as fondly remembered as Dick Miller but he is well cast as the klutzy Seymour Krelboyne father of the blood thirsty exotic plant Audrey and Mel Welles hams it up as his tyrannical boss Mushnick. But the show is stolen by Miller as a flower eating hipster and an astonishingly fresh faced Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dental patient a classic bit! as much as Audrey herself.

Lead actor Jonathan Haze didn't have a notable career after this but Jackie Joseph would go on to a lot of film television roles and TV cartoon voiceovers. Other cast members Dick Miller and Mel Welles would go on to appear in many television and movie roles and Miller is still very active today. Writer Charles B Griffith and Roger Corman wrote this in a single night gave their actors three days to rehearse and shot it in two days. Griffith supplies the voice of the maneating plant.

Jonathan Haze is brilliant as the dumb florist assistant in love. He created a new type of plant and that causes a whole lot of trouble...and comedy.

This movie shouldn't even be called a horror movie I don't know anyone who was scared by this movie if they were then don't watch a movie like The Wasp Woman. The story of this movie is hilarious and so are the characters. This movie is about a young man named Seymour Krelboyne who nurtures a plant then discovers it's a talking man eating plant The plant is funny the lines that the plant says like Feed Me SeymourYou look fat enough.

The acting is this movie is good. The actors really make the movie funny. Mel Welles plays a funny Gravis Mushnik and Dick Miller makes a great Burson Fouch and the character of the old woman every day she loses a family member. The funniest scene in the movie SPOILERS CONTAINED! is the scene in the dentist. Where Seymour Krelboyne is pulling out a man teeth. The man is played by Jack Nicholson. This was supposedly his first movie. Overall. This movie is brilliant. There was a remake in the 1980. I liked that one but the original is still the best.

	schema:reviewBody "The first version of The Little Shop of Horrors long before the Broadway musical and Frank Oz's musicalhorrorcomedy is one of the primary examples of shoestring moviemaking. Shoestring of course refers mostly to the budget and this possibly ranks above others like Clerks Slacker Night of the Living Dead and Blair Witch in order to put it together so quickly. And yet for all of its little slipups and deranged moments of comedy it does work for what its worth. Not that it doesn't show that the film was made in two days but on those terms of extremely lowbudget goforbroke Bmoviemaking Roger Corman as a director has quite a nifty effort here. The story is similar to a fairytale a darkly comic one to be sure like one of the Fractures Fairy tales from the old Rocky  Bullwinkle show in how Seymour Jonathan Haze perfect as an awkward easily shockable little guy tries to nurture a plant to earn the affections of Audrey Jackie Joseph. But then the plant turns into a meateater to put it that way and from there Charles Griffith's script goes into wild comic turns where he now has to figure out how to take care of the plant before it 'takes care' of him. Some scenes are less notable than others and sometimes the cheesiness of it all just look at the plant itself for proof enough can be wearisome. But Corman keeps the atmosphere with a giddy amount of late 50s 'shlock' and some scenes stand the test of time as the best of their Bmovie status. Tops go to the 2nd film appearance from Nicholson as the most psychotic of the bunch as a 'chipper' fetishist who gets off on getting his wretched teeth worked on it's a masterpiece of a scene with cartoonish action innuendo and crazy looks from a 23 year old Nicholson. Worth checking out maybe more than once and you're likely to find it appropriately in the cheapest lot of DVDs and videos at your local store.".

But then the plant turns into a meateater to put it that way and from there Charles Griffith's script goes into wild comic turns where he now has to figure out how to take care of the plant before it 'takes care' of him. Some scenes are less notable than others and sometimes the cheesiness of it all just look at the plant itself for proof enough can be wearisome. But Corman keeps the atmosphere with a giddy amount of late 50s 'shlock' and some scenes stand the test of time as the best of their Bmovie status. Tops go to the 2nd film appearance from Nicholson as the most psychotic of the bunch as a 'chipper' fetishist who gets off on getting his wretched teeth worked on it's a masterpiece of a scene with cartoonish action innuendo and crazy looks from a 23 year old Nicholson. Worth checking out maybe more than once and you're likely to find it appropriately in the cheapest lot of DVDs and videos at your local store.";

My favorites include If hit by a truck call your physician. and it grows like a cold sore on the lip. The chase scene at the end is something to make the Zucker and Abrahams families proud.

Although both versions of the film are rather good the original has a true place in cult history. The comedy in the musical is a little more oriented for people of all ages but the original is truly a masterpiece of black comedy. The story starts at Mushnick's flower shop and we are introduced to most of the main characters right away. This is pretty typical of any Corman film from the time. There is Mr. Mushnick who plays a tyrant of a boss we have Audrey who is a very sweet young lady then we have the lead of the movie Seymour who is ultimately a joke. Dick Miller plays the man who is eating flowers in the shop and there are a few other characters who are more on the side. Anyway Seymour is about to get fired when he tells his boss that he has a plant he might be interested in. His boss sends him to retrieve this plant and of course the plant is dying so Mr. Mushnick tells him he has one week to revive the plant. Of course later that day Seymour finds that the plant only wants blood to eat. Well there's the story because you can only imagine what happens afterwords. The end of the movie is still one of the funniest endings ever I think anyway. Look for a small role by Jack Nickleson as the masochistic dental patient. 8 stars".

Jackie Joseph is also amusing here with that funny voice of hers she also cracked me up. Mel Welles was my favorite character here he had me on the floor and i want to see more of him after this he did a great job here giving a wonderful campy performance I LOVED him. Dick Miller is great here in his limited time he was also in The Terror he did good here. Myrtle Vail is hilarious here as the mother that is always thinking that she has some sickness she cracked me up too. Jack Nicholson is HILARIOUS i couldn't stop laughing after a few minutes he is so funny as the guy who LOVES pain. Overall a cool film that is well worth seeing  out of 5".

The owner of the shop is played by Mel Welles who went on to direct Lady Frankenstein in Italy.

Jonathan Haze stars as the clerk who serves the hungry plant until it's big enough to eat the store although the box of the prerecorded tape shows the nowfamous Nicholson holding the plant.Despite the film's seventyminute running time it's crowded with blackcomedy gags they overlap each like roofing shingles. The first one is a quick spoof of Dragnet's typical kickoff narration after which things get increasingly frantic until the plot finally swallows its own tail and vanishes altogether. Critics initially scoffed at Corman's twoday movie but now they refer to it as one of Corman's best efforts. A computercolorized version is available if you'd like to see what a carnivorous gilded lily looks like.".

I guess it was only a matter of time before someone got the bright idea to do a comedy from those attempts.Some of them weren't all that funny people did in fact get killed a lot of them in trying to master the air. But by 1910 there were all kinds of airplanes and even some early helicopters and a lot are shown in Those Magnificent Men. The plot centers about an international race from London to Paris sponsored by one of the English press lords played in true John Bull style by Robert Morley. He's got a spirited suffragette daughter in Sarah Miles and a most proper member of the King's Coldstream Guards in James Fox courting her.But along comes another flier an American cowboy Stuart Whitman who becomes Fox's air and romantic rival. But the film's got more than that. It's got Italian hopeful Alberto Sordi who can impregnate his wife with a dirty look. It's got Frenchman Jean PierreCassel who keeps running into Irina Demick every place he goes. It's even got another English contestant in TerryThomas who's busy trying to sabotage everyone else.However my favorite is the German entry Gert Frobe. Poor Frobe has to pinch hit for the original German flier who partied too hardy. But as he tries to prove as long as you follow the instruction book the German Army can accomplish anything. Seeing him try to fly his airplane while reading the instruction book is my favorite memory of Those Magnificent Men.That and that incredibly catchy title song. I defy anyone to watch this film and not come away humming that tune for weeks. It will embed itself in your subconscious forever.Those Magnificent Men is good entertainment and a gentle tribute to those early air pioneers.".

It was gut busting funny at the time but hasn't aged that well due to the general public's far more sophisticated mindset these days. But it's still funny. Anyone who is a fan of flying or the history of traditional European nationalistic rivalry will still howl at this clever and at times very sharp satire. We see some of the attitudes that would help fuel the violent world wars that would erupt soon after 1910. The vintage aircraft some authentic some not are sure to excite aircraft fans. The footage of the genuine planes actually flying across the English countryside is genuinely MAGNIFICENT. Many running gags through the length of the movie. My favorite is the obvious one...the redhead. I caught this on our PBS station just last night and as always I was hooked again and had to watch till two in the morning. There's something about most English movies from the 60's that is just magical. Even the bad ones like Casino Royale are still fascinating to watch. Great international casts clever scripts funny situations sight gags...whole packages. Fun Movies plain and simple. Those Magnificent Men... isn't a great film or even a great comedy. But it's still a genuine Fun Movie and well worth at least a rental fee.

They came in all sizes and shapes. In the very beginning of the movie they show actual footage of early flight failures and they are familiar but still fascinating. Interspiced in the actual footage are closeups of Red Skelton playing the part of some of those unsuccessful fliers.

I was surprised to learn that Blake Edwards had nothing to do with this movie except perhaps set an example of how great films are made with his many hit movies like THE PINK PANTHER for example with an opening theme that was so popular that they had to make a cartoon series out of that silly pink feline. Back to the movie.Terry Thoman made such a delightfully sinister villain that even though we were not supposed to like him neither did we want him to get his just desserts too soon in the movie.Alberto Sordi played the Italian perfectly. Maybe his being a real Italian with a long list of Italian comedies always funny but never typecast.Ethnic stereotypes were played out throughout the movie. But considering that they were played by an international cast an Italian actor playing the Italian pilot a German actor playing the German pilot etc... Nobody could or should've taken offense. The whole movie was done in fun the way a good comedy should be done.I was surprised to find this movie on a discounted DVD. It cost less than 9.00. Even in the 18.00 price range this movie would've been worth its price. I was also surprised to find that I enjoy this movie just as much today as I did when I saw it in 1965. One may call it second childhood. I call it an excellent movie.Buy it don't rent it. That way you will be able to enjoy this movie over and over again. I know I have.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film in a Queens movie theater in 1965 and always enjoyed it both for it's humor it's wonderful use of 1910 aircraft and it's underlying reality in the nationalistic tensions of the day.James Fox has been romancing Sarah Miles. He is a British Naval officer who has been one of the early experts on heavier than air flight. Miles is a suffragette type the daughter of Press lord Robert Morley. Fox not only wants to marry Miles but he wants to push for more government interest in aviation. Miles arranges for him to have lunch with her and her father and Fox hits a nerve saying that while England rules the seas with it's great fleets it does not rule the air. In his best blimpish manner Morley looks straight ahead and says England should rule the air. He decides to set up a 10000 pound prize for the first successful air flight between the world's two leading cities London to Paris.Actually no such flight race occurred in 1910 but it could easily have. Morley's Lord Rawnsley is modeled a little on the real life Lord Northcliffe owner of the Times of London and also a booster of British supremacy. He frequently offered prizes for firsts as did his American counterpart William Randolph Hearst  whose 1910 prize for the first coasttocoast flight spurred on Cal P. Roger's series of flights in the Viz Fin Flyer from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In 1909 a Northcliffe prize for the first plane to fly the English Channel was won by Louis Bleriot of France  an event that plays a small role in the Joan Fontaine melodrama IVY.Soon the competitors show up. America is represented by Stuart Whitman and his partner Sam Wanamaker. Fox is annoyed after awhile by Whitman's romancing Miles  and allowing her a plane ride something her father had forbidden Fox to give her. Jean Pierre Cassels represents France. His time is spent preparing for the race and romancing a variety of young woman in France and England all played by Irina Dimmick who resemble each other and confuse him. Soon he is also involved with avenging the loss of Alsace Lorraine. The Kaiser has sent Gert Frobe and Karl Michael Vogler to win for the Fatherland. Cassels does everything he can think of to humiliate the Hun and succeeds admirably. Alberto Sordi appears as an Italian nobleman who is loyal to his wife  they have many children who spends money on new aircraft. He is constantly buying experimental aircraft from a mad inventor Tony Hancock. In one case his new plane is destroyed when it flies into the path of a pair of duelists aiming at each other. Japan is represented by Yujiro Ishihara his name is Yamamoto which suggests far ahead coming events. And Fox is not the only English contestant. Gordon Jackson is another but worse is TerryThomas.Usually playing the comic bounder part TerryThomas had his best bounder in this film and it's sequel MONTE CARLO OR BUST which deals with the first Monte Carlo Rally in 1923. Here he plays Sir Percy WareArmitage a manufacturer of dubious reputation but great wealth who is interested in the glory of winning the prize not so much for his county but for himself. In the sequel he was WareArmitage's son Cuthbert who was equally a bounder but interested in automobile development. WareArmitage constantly forces his valet  all purpose servant Erik Sykes to do his bidding by blackmail in sabotaging all the other competitors.We watch all these characters collide with each other and other secondary characters such as Benny Hill as the head of the fire department that is taking care of disasters on the aviation field the race is to start from. And we are aware of the limitations of each pilot and their aircraft until they take off on their flight. Who will win and why? I won't go into it but the results are comical and the film seems to hint at the set up for 1919. It is a comical gem even using Red Skelton at the start as a historical wing flapper who keeps meeting disasters from the stone age to the Wright Brothers but still is considering his options in the age of supersonic jets.".

He decides to set up a 10000 pound prize for the first successful air flight between the world's two leading cities London to Paris.Actually no such flight race occurred in 1910 but it could easily have. Morley's Lord Rawnsley is modeled a little on the real life Lord Northcliffe owner of the Times of London and also a booster of British supremacy. He frequently offered prizes for firsts as did his American counterpart William Randolph Hearst  whose 1910 prize for the first coasttocoast flight spurred on Cal P. Roger's series of flights in the Viz Fin Flyer from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In 1909 a Northcliffe prize for the first plane to fly the English Channel was won by Louis Bleriot of France  an event that plays a small role in the Joan Fontaine melodrama IVY.Soon the competitors show up. America is represented by Stuart Whitman and his partner Sam Wanamaker. Fox is annoyed after awhile by Whitman's romancing Miles  and allowing her a plane ride something her father had forbidden Fox to give her. Jean Pierre Cassels represents France. His time is spent preparing for the race and romancing a variety of young woman in France and England all played by Irina Dimmick who resemble each other and confuse him. Soon he is also involved with avenging the loss of Alsace Lorraine. The Kaiser has sent Gert Frobe and Karl Michael Vogler to win for the Fatherland. Cassels does everything he can think of to humiliate the Hun and succeeds admirably. Alberto Sordi appears as an Italian nobleman who is loyal to his wife  they have many children who spends money on new aircraft. He is constantly buying experimental aircraft from a mad inventor Tony Hancock. In one case his new plane is destroyed when it flies into the path of a pair of duelists aiming at each other. Japan is represented by Yujiro Ishihara his name is Yamamoto which suggests far ahead coming events. And Fox is not the only English contestant. Gordon Jackson is another but worse is TerryThomas.Usually playing the comic bounder part TerryThomas had his best bounder in this film and it's sequel MONTE CARLO OR BUST which deals with the first Monte Carlo Rally in 1923. Here he plays Sir Percy WareArmitage a manufacturer of dubious reputation but great wealth who is interested in the glory of winning the prize not so much for his county but for himself. In the sequel he was WareArmitage's son Cuthbert who was equally a bounder but interested in automobile development. WareArmitage constantly forces his valet  all purpose servant Erik Sykes to do his bidding by blackmail in sabotaging all the other competitors.We watch all these characters collide with each other and other secondary characters such as Benny Hill as the head of the fire department that is taking care of disasters on the aviation field the race is to start from. And we are aware of the limitations of each pilot and their aircraft until they take off on their flight. Who will win and why? I won't go into it but the results are comical and the film seems to hint at the set up for 1919. It is a comical gem even using Red Skelton at the start as a historical wing flapper who keeps meeting disasters from the stone age to the Wright Brothers but still is considering his options in the age of supersonic jets.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fox played this movie today and I watched it. Preceding the movie was a collection of scary gory clips that I couldn't show my kids. So when I channelflipped back to it I was doubly shocked at how enjoyable this film was. This is one of many films that America is incapable of producing due to it's optimism emphasis on living and view of the future. It is just a fun movie so perhaps I shouldn't make it sound so serious. There are plenty of disasters but all seem done in fun and humor. The race is started by a bunch of people who by and large want to win at any cost. In the end... the moral of the story seems to be that those who live with honor win in the end. It's a sort of reminder about points like this. It is refreshing to see a film like this once in awhile. It is long... but make sure and watch at least half of it. Especially if you have kids. Oh it is also somewhat funny. I would say that it's a comedy but contains neither slapstick nor 'sophisticated' humor. Little things such as seeing the dog flying shotgun in the back seat of an old plane with the sign saying something like 'I am the first dog ever to fly in an airplane' or so are typical of the silly going ons. If you've seen  liked films such as 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' or 'It's a Mad Mad Mad World' then know this film is different but you may like it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't pay any attention to reviews posted by Germans they're just ticked off because not only were Germans depicted as total buffoons they didn't even come close to winning the race! Not just the Americans and English were treated well but the Japanese fellow was depicted as being extremely intelligent and the Frenchman was obviously an allaround competent fellow  in the plane and in the hay. Who could ask for anything more? Incidentally I loved the extremely short Frenchman the 'second' and I wondered who he was. Even the Italian came off fairly well I thought. He came close to winning the race and speaking of races his skill at propagating the Italian race was exemplary. I've watched this movie many times and it's definitely way up on my good list. I'm not going to try to say it is 'one of the greatest films of all time!' But just the cinematography is worth 8 stars I think. I especially feel that way since getting the DVD and seeing what it looks like in widescreen. Some views of the English countryside are stunning. Also it doesn't hurt that I'm a fan of early aviation and the 'real' airplanes were well done. Now it's true that the humor is rather broad. Speaking of broads even though I think Sarah Miles is really cute especially in bloomers she is sometimes a bit much in this film. I wonder if her vocal coach approved of squeaking as a form of communication. Also sometimes she looks like she has so much makeup on that it threatens to crack and fall off. Since respectable women of the time didn't wear makeup which is why they look so plain in photographs it would have been OK for her to maybe look a little more natural. The DVD has a recent interview with the director Kenneth Annakin. Word has gotten out about his comments regarding problems between Stuart Whitman and Sarah Miles. It has been said that Stuart's advances were undesired. Well my interpretation of what he said is that Stuart practically tried to rape her Bad Bad!. Annakin also mentioned that they really wanted Dick Van Dyke for the role his agent didn't show him the script and that the movie would have been entirely different with Dick. That's the understatement of the century. Try to imagine a basically 'nice guy' like Van Dyke replacing Stuart's somewhat edgy character. In a way Whitman seemed like an excellent representation of the rest of the world's view of Americans as roughedged. Van Dyke would have confused that view. Perhaps Americans would have liked the film better as a result but would it have adversely affected the film's overall place in the scheme of things? Hard to say. Speaking of suspension of disbelief were we? one could go on at length about various scenes that strain credulity. If I were a pilot who had just 'taken up' someone for a flight and a wing strut broke I would try to land the plane as quickly as possible. I would most definitely not turn the controls over to the hapless passenger and attempt to climb out on the wing to repair the strut. Unless perhaps I had suddenly decided to commit suicide and manslaughter. In any case kudos to the producers for great cinematography use of authentic reproduction aircraft and a gemutlichkeit assemblage of actori.".

Sometimes this one is downright corny and in places it wears a bit thin but somehow it manages to capture your affection. Sure most of the characters are onedimensional stereotypical cartoon cutouts  but the film never pretends to be anything deep and meaningful. It pokes fun at the stiff upperlipped British  the formal and pompous Germans and the amorous French etc with a few crazy Italians thrown in and noone is else spared either. This is how it plays on your preconceived ideas of those blasted foreigners. Part slapstick with Benny Hill's Keystone Cop like firemen and part heroic adventure with Stuart Whitmans goodguy cowboy role to save the day and everyone a good sport except the fabulously funny villain Terry Thomas. The thing to remember is that they just don't make films like this anymore. Watch a parade of notable English comics pass by intermingled with the other international cast members. English M'Lord Rawnsley of a very large English newspaper is inspired  of course it was his idea or so he claims  by his liberated and unruly daughter to put up ten thousand pounds in prize money for the first pilot to fly the English channel  because Brittania rules the waves so by George she ought to rule the skies as well . So the scene is set for a motley crew to fly their vintage and unreliable and downright dangerous aircraft across the channel. Along the way nasty Sir Percy  Terry Thomas  aided by slightly sneaky and not too loyal Courtney  Eric Sykes  does his villainous best to sabotage the other aircraft but he gets his comeuppance in the end. Stuart Whitman in Levis gets to challenge James Fox the very sportsmanlike Englishman for Sarah Miles affections. A lot of fun and great to look at. Enjoy.".

Part of the problem is that the producer working over director Ken Annakin's shoulder wanted the love triangle between James Fox Stuart Whitman and Sarah Miles accentuated. This was partly good thinking because one cannot laugh solidly for more than an hour.  Any comedy will pall after that period and the story carries us through until after the intermission.The glimpses of slapstick we see are well done but few and far between. They include a runaway airplanemotorcycle and a duel fought from balloons which does have a good payoff.  The comedy might've been sharpened but the draw to the theatres was probably to see the reproductions of antique airplanes.  The movie does provide some of the best blue screen work before George Lucas and one always believes the stars are actually flying.  For this reason the movie cries out to be seen in letterbox as it is on DVD but the grandeur of the photography and good effects is diminished on  the small screen.Still the impressive international cast is game.  The competitors in the air race all represent nationalities and they are types so they are easily identifiable.  The cast's obvious enthusiasm for the project raises the viewer's own spirits.  And there are very bright spots.  Gert Frobe Goldfinger the leader of the German contingent manages some laughs by an amazing one man band effect and yes it's really him.  JeanPierre Cassel has a running gag that doesn't really work but which features the beautiful Irina Demick The Longest Day so it's always worth watching. Jeremy Lloyd provides some bright humor as the silly naval officer who wants to take the first dog in flight.  Tiny bits by TerryThomas Eric Sykes Benny Hill and Robert Morley are amusing.  Tony Hancock as the inventor with a leg in a cast steals every scene he's in and his payoff nearly steals the whole movie.On the down side Stuart Whitman is an astounding and ineffective addition to the cast as the American competitor.  It turns out from the DVD commentary Ken Annakin first wanted Dick van Dyke but van Dyke's agent never showed him the script and they had to cast it  but why not find someone who has some comic timing?  As it turns out from later in the commentary Whitman nearly wrecked the movie in other ways.But the flying scenes of the reproduction airplanes make this movie imminently watchable.  One grows weary of the interminable crashes early in the film and the race isn't very exciting but just watching them fly and realizing with a shiver that human beings actually went up in the air in those things make the movie fun.  If you don't need highspeed highoctane fullthrottle comedy but have time for a leisurely picture that's well acted and beautifully shot this isn't a bad way to spend two hours and a half.".

	schema:headline " Fun even if it is a bit too long";
	schema:reviewBody "I first watched this film on television as a child in the 1970s but didn't remember much apart from the fact that it featured several rather implausible aircraft crashing in hilarious fashion mostly before the opening credits! Watching it again I can see why they were the most memorable scenes for a child however there is more to the film than that. Set in 1910 in the early days of aviation a news paper proprietor offers a prize of 10000 for the winner of an air race from London to Paris. The first half of the film introduces us to the various competitors who come from a variety of countries including America Germany Italy France Japan and of course England and with the exception of the Japanese pilot they live up to their national stereotypes thankfully this is done in playful rather than an offensive way. Once in England they get to practice their flying and get into various scrapes... many of which leave the poor pilots splashing into the sewage works next to the aerodrome. While this is going on a romantic subplot develops involving the proprietor's daughter Patricia who is being courted English pilot Richard Mays but she takes a shine to the American Orvil Newton. The race takes place in the second half of the film and somewhat inevitably the main competition seems to be between the Newton and Mays although one can't count out the Italian.This film is a bit too long but contains some good laughs and fine performances often from the secondary characters personal favourites being Gert 'Goldfinger' Frbe who plays the bythebook German and Terry Thomas who plays the cheating Sir Percy WareArmitage. One will also spot several well known comic actors of the time including Benny Hill Eric Sykes and Tony Hancock all putting in amusing performances. The flying sequences are impressive and while some stunts were obviously blue screen others looked surprisingly realistic. As well as the various amusing problems with the planes there are a couple of nice running gags Patricia ends up losing her skirt the first couple of times she meets Newton and the French pilot keeps bumping into women who look identical... and are indeed played by the same actress. Overall this film is good innocent fun there is nothing that one wouldn't want a child to see.".

The movie is full of old time magic when computers didn't exist and it is full of ingenuity from the technical crews.Thats why it looks real because it is real and not the CGI stuff they would have done today.The DVD contains an extremely interesting commentary from the director who explains how it was all done.

First it's nice to remember a time when a good director knew the power of INFERRING something rather than just pushing it in your face.Case in point  the scene where Gert Frobe's pompous tinhatted Colonel finds himself the sidecar passenger in an outofcontrol motorcycle combination  his driver having jumped ship  heading for the banked circuit.We already KNOW there's a SEWAGE FARM which for those who haven't seen one this writer can tell you is a huge open pool of poo and pee beyond  and as the bike and its portly occupant zooms up the embankment crashes through the top and disappears from sight the shot stays WHERE IT IS.And with perfect timing a SPLURK! and a huge BROWN spray SHOOTS up into the air. It got the biggest laugh in cinemas since Jacques Tati as M. Hulot stepped onto that tow rope and got CATAPAULTED into the harbour.But m'point is  we never SAW the landing. The audience members had to IMAGINE it  which was SIX times funnier than any shot Ken Annakin could have devised.Mention should also be made of the superb performance of Herr Frobe. Despite being ingeniously cast against type comedy was his forte as the greatest Bond villain of all time Auric Goldfinger a year earlier he scored brilliantly in this opus.And second nonBrits should know that TerryThomas' character's name  WareArmitage  had a special meaning in '60s Britain. ArmitageWare its reverse was a popular maker of toilet porcelain goods loo bowls urinals etc.  which made British audiences snigger every time his name was mentioned.Incidentally this reporter was in Watford when Magnificent Men opened. He mentions this since he noticed that for ONE WEEK in 1965  ALL SIX CINEMAS in that town were running a DIFFERENT film that featured TerryThomas. In addition to his role in Magnificent Men he was in a rerun of It's A Mad x4 World a revival of Tom Thumb and three other productions.All of them were elevated by his special brand of cad and bounder. It was a happening that apparently noone but this then12yearold boy noticed  and as a record it probably still stands today.".

For everyone else it is a delight. What you see are perfect stereotypes of various nationalities The stiff upperlip Englishman the romantic Frenchman the oversexed Italian the perfectionist Prussian and of course the American cowboy. Without question the three best characters are Lord Rawnsley Robert Morley Colonel Manfred Von Holstein Gert Frobe Who played 'Goldfinger' in 'Goldfinger'and Sir Percy WareArmitage TerryThomas who is the main villain in the film He is the obvious inspiration for Dick Dastardly from Dastardly and Muttley and his assistant Courtney Eric Sykes is essentially Muttley.Although the race is exciting the buildup might be even better with the best involving Von Holstein learning to fly by reading a German flight manual and going up against Frenchman Pierre Dubois JeanPierre Cassel in a battle of National Anthems. The puns in this film are priceless such as when Lord Rawnsley who says the worst thing about international competitions are too many bloody foreigners or this one between Richard Mays James Fox who when asking Lord Rawnsley for the hand in marriage of Patricia Sarah Miles said he would be busy 5 out of 6 nights and offered to give up a night of cards her father said No we don't want to spoil the old girl now do we? and still another is when Dubois had to land his plane in a nunnery and when the Mother Superior Flora Robson did not want to help he said You don't want a Protestant to win the race now do you? They helped him. There are two battles in this film One is to see who will win the race and the other is for Patricia with Richard vs American Orvil Newton Stuart Whitman. A key point is most of the people really did not need the prize of 10000 Pounds Orvil excluded so it is about the honor And bragging rights such as in the case of Sir Percy of winning the race or to quote the hopes of Lord Rawlsley Britiania rules the air as well as the seas. Major Spoiler Ahead The winner of the race is Richard because Orvil gave up the opportunity to win to save the life of Count Emilio Ponticelli Alberto Sordi when his plane caught on fire. Richard turned out to be sporting by splitting the prize with Orvil Although he totally did not get it by saying you could have won. The real winner however was Orvil because that act enabled him to win the hand of Patricia who knew how badly he needed the money He could not have shipped his plane home without it yet he was willing to give that up for someone in need which spoke to his character. That along with the fact he really wanted her He would do stuff for her that her father forbid Such as taking her flying instead of viewing her as a future Trophy Wife as Richard did At least until Orvil popped up made her choose Orvil. Everything about this film from the theme song to the planes to the story to the characters And I did not mention all of them to the race to the humor to the scenes of Patricia and her skirt to Benny Hill as Fire Chief Perkins and everything else was excellent. So the winner is? The audience of this film that is who. 1010 Stars.".

But the original intention was to chat up the young Brits  and thereby to presumably improve their standard of spoken English .As often happens during these kind of linguistic holidays the kids tend to regroup with others from their own country thereby reducing the need to speak a foreign language ! That of course is contrary to the aim of such a holiday but it is a hard fact !!  The music used notably that of Mortimer Schuman is very good and a whold generation of young French people know the film and remember it through this music.As an Englishman living in France I find all that rather amusing and making for good light entertainment. I haven't the foggiest idea whether the film is known in the UK but as someone knowing what makes the British laugh I would not see it as having much success on that side of the Channel ! Though it may bring back pleasant  or perhaps less pleasant  memories for British families who have welcomed foreign kids for summer courses. I have seen very few comments on imdb for the film so presume it is not too well known outside France !".

	schema:headline " A classic! One of John Carpenter's Best!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Fog 1980 is a classic horror film from John Carpenter! Right after Halloween this is a John Carpenter's BEST horror movie!! Much better as always than the remake. The remake sucked ass It took me 3.hrs of watching the movie till I finish it. I will never watch the remake again. This film is fast paced not boring not too over long and goes with the story perfect! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies.It is interesting movie and very intense horror film.I absolutely love this classic horror flick about revenge that began 100. years ago As the Californian coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary paranormal activity begins to occur at the stroke of midnight. Revenge ghost keep visiting Antonio Bay and killing people ancestors who were responsible for killing them 100.years ago and stealing their gold. Seriously I love this movie to death. It is American Horror classic flick I love it. I can always enjoy watching this film I had fun with it and the film is Entertaining a great horror s lasher genre from the 80's. According to legend six sailors killed when shipwrecked 100 years ago in Antonio Bay California will rise to avenge their deaths when a strange glowing fog appears. The town is commemorating the centenary of the shipwreck and Father Malone discovers a diary kept by an ancestor he learns that the ship was wrecked by six founding fathers of the town. The vengeance of their victims will be the death of six people. As daylight fades a mysterious fog envelops the town and begins to strew panic and death. The pain plot to film that evolves a ghosts 100.years ago that were betrayed and robbed now 100.years anniversary they are coming for revenge as the fog and killing people. One of my favorite best horror flicks from John Carpenter. The Fog 1980 was the perfect movie to watch on Halloween or at least during Halloween season. I think if Jamie Lee Curtis maybe got the DJ role instead of the hitchhiker one she probably would've said nicer things about it. Even though I know it's unrelated I think this is the closest we'll ever get to an American 'Blind Dead' remake. The Fog was intended as PG but Carpenter put in stronger scenes due to a negative test screening. He mentioned that on the Fear On Film on the Criterion DVDBluRay for Video.The Original movie The Fog was a classic. What I do not understand is Debra Hill produced the Original Fog and The Remake and the remake was just awful. It was not scary the effects were terrible acting was terrible and the new Stevie Wayne was just insulting and terrible. Adrienne Barbeau was awesome as DJ Stevie Wayne in The Fog she also co started a year later in my all time favorite SciFi Action flick Escape From New York 1981 in which she is the beautiful in both movies  but In Escape From New York she is deadly Maggie. There are a lot actors and actress who worked with John Carpenter before and in the future films. Jamie Lee Curtis who played hitchhiker also played 2.years earlier in Halloween 1978 first classic Carpenter horror film. Sorry I don't like that movie but I love this movie. I can go with this film anytime. Tom Atkins he also co started a year later in Escape From New York alongside with Adrienne Barbeau. They never shared screen time together in that film and they never shared any screen time in this on either.It's a favorite of mine and that version of the movie beats the tar off of the 2005 version.They're not even alike and the second one to me is just plain fake! This one has so much more human interaction and realism. Great cast maintained the creepy atmosphere throughout and plenty of good frights. I loved this movie from start to finish! It is a good ghost story and an awesome horror flick of mine! I love this film to death! I love it!!! I love Adrienne In this this film. I Love her on air voice and a terrified scene on the end of the movie when she had to face the ghosts alone. The Fog 1980 it is still all time classic and Everyone is still talking about this horror film today! The rating I am giving to this film is 1010 it deserves it and it is John Carpenter's underrated best horror film for me. It is my 6th favorite best Carpenter film.".

I remember seeing 'Prince of Darkness' and wasn't too impresed by it despite all the neat special effects. I'll reserve further comment for that page.My bias runs towards the traditional ghost story and variations on that theme.All the elements of a good ghost story are in 'The Fog' an ancient crime retribution foreshadowing atmosphere and discovery of why things are going wrong. The film is most powerful because of what is not shown or explained. It's not even necessary to see the faces of the drowned lepers  just the glowing eyes and the sense of rotted bodies is more than enough thank you!Antonio Bay is celebrating its anniversary as a town. However the residents don't know the terrible secrets behind the founding of their township. 100 years ago Blake a rich man was afflicted with the disease of leprosy. He wanted to use his own money to establish a colony for him and others like him. The town fathers back then though didn't want a leper colony close by. They pretended to be sympathetic then hatched a conspiracy to lure Blake's ship to the rocks where it crashed and all on board drowned. The town fathers had nothing against taking Blake's gold however. You see this is one of those movies where you have to pay attention  sometimes that is asking a lot with the public's short attention span of today. Pay particular attention to Hal Holbrook who plays Father Malone when he is reading from the diary that falls out of the church walls. That will go a long way in explaining the ending.I also love this movie because it was made before all the advances in computer technology. There is an 'organic' feel and look to the special effects  very unlike all the computergenerated tricks you see in movies of today. People had to be more creative back then. Today technology is so relied upon that many in Hollywood have become lazy. I still marvel at how Demille did the parting of the Red Sea in 'The Ten Commandments  way before all these computer advances!My main complaint with the fog is that the progression of events is a bit choppy and uneven but that doesn't stop you from enjoying the movie. Also take note of how this is one of those flicks where you can read all the credits and know who did what. It annoys me that today's movies when they run them on television do this splitscreen nonsense and roll the credits so darn fast you can't see who worked on the film.Consensus is mixed on this film. Some say it's Carpenter's worse. I can't say that because I haven't many of his films. I'm not a fan of the slashertype stuff. I love the more subtle chilling effects the power of the unspoken word or a certain look etc.I'm 43 now and when I'm talking to the 20somethings about scary movies from years ago I make it a point to bring up 'The Fog'!".

	schema:reviewBody "A solid powerful storyslowly developing and photographed with a unique sense for tension. THAT is The Fog'. This story will leave a big impression on you and it's easily John Carpenter's best and most effective horror film. His most underrated as well since people always refer to Halloween' and The Thing' when listing his best accomplishments as a director. Personally I think The Fog is much more haunting and fascinating than these two and it's one of the very few films that still scares me after all these years. Uniquely set in a small coasttown called Antonio Bay where the inhabitants are preparing the celebrations for the town's hundredth anniversary. Only they do not know that the genesis of their town went together with a devilish conspiracy resulting in the unfortunate death of many seamen. These doomed victims rise again now suddenly appearing from mysterious fogbanks that come from the ocean. If you're  like me  a sucker for ghostly myths set in abandoned surrounding The Fog will be one of your most satisfying purchases ever. Carpenter brilliantly builds up an unbearable tension through simple methods like long shots of an isolated countryside and a chilling musical score not as famous as his Halloween' score but equally effective. The bloodshed and images of coldhearted monsters are kept to a minimum in order to leave it up to your own imagination. And for once this actually works! The detailed sequences in which the town gets surrounded by an inescapable fog is more than horrific enough. Forget about all the overblown bigbudgeted and socalled horrifying' films This little overlooked production scares the hell out of people since more than 20 years already. And it'll keep on doing so for yet another very long time!".

The best part of the film is that it made no attempt to explain everything away in a hokey horror sense Why are the bodies returning to life?. Things happen simply because they happen. Much like Night of the Living Dead the characters are not concerned with why they are in danger but more concerned with getting out of danger. On a side note John Carpenter has the best endings of any filmmaker on the market. Just as Halloween and The Thing both ended with a sense of foreboding and silent terror The Fog ends with style and allows the viewer one final scare. A definite hit!!!".

For some reason phones that begin ringing on their own and car alarms that go off without any reason is still much more scarier than a CGIghost appearing out of a wall. John Carpenter has always been a master in creating scary creepy scene's with minimal resources but maximum scare. If you also liked this movies I also recommend In the Mouth of Madness to you a criminally underrated horror masterpiece also directed by John Carpenter. The movie has a good and original creepy story with awesome ghostly figures and gore without any blood. It is notable that this movie had a low budget which works perfectly for the dark depressing atmosphere. The movie is quite short and because of that the movie feels 'incomplete' if like not all of the events are covered in the story this is also due to the fact that the movie has an open ending of course like almost every horror movie has. For some reason because of this 'incomplete' feeling the movie feels even creepier.The movie has some good actors in it. Remember this movie was made back in the days when it still was OK for well known actors to appear in horror movies. Present day only young unknown actors seem to appear in horror movies. This movie stars Jamie Lee Curtis Janet Leigh Psycho and Hal Holbrook. Not the worlds worst actors if you ask me. It's especially amazing that all of those three are in this one movie considering the low budget of the movie.This movie is perfect in what it tries to achieve. It creates a perfect horror atmosphere with a typical creepy musical score by John Carpenter himself and has some good creepy moments in it. This is one of the rare real scary movies ever made.

I have fond memories of watching this with my mother for the first time at night and remembering both of us having goosebumps. The movie begins with an old sea captain played brilliantly by John Houseman telling a group of children around a fire about a ship that crashed into the rocks because they saw a strange light in the area. All the men drowned though their spirits never rested. Instead they lie in wait for the day when they will take their revenge on those who wronged them. A very effective opening indeed. Though it does not end there. All around town strange things begin to happen car horns and lights start going off glass is blown apart in local shops and a strange fog seemly comes out of nowhere. Beware of this because there's something very powerful in that fog. So many things make this movie what it is. First the effects are simple but effective. Scenes are shot in a wide pan vision giving the film a broader look the fog is so simple but yet so intimidating at the same time. Then there is the acting. I don't think one could ask for a better cast then what we have here Tom Atkins Jamie Lee Curtis Janet Leigh Hal Holbrook to name a few. But perhaps what really makes the movie what it is is the fact that everyone loves a good ghost story and John Carpenter along with Debra Hill manage to give us just that. PS.

As the clock ticks past midnight strange events start to occur around the town it seems that the town has a secret and that secret is back to make a point...Not as praised as Halloween and The Thing from John Carpenter's early horror output The Fog sees the director tackle the ghost story premise. For many who lapped it up back when the 80s began it still enthrals and holds in its eerie vice like grip for others in this desensitised age of gore and cgi overkill it proves to be a film unable to justify the love poured on it by the fans. Which is a shame.Being able to appreciate the craft of John Carpenter back in 1980 certainly helps to avert some harsh criticisms thrown its way because Carpenter has achieved pound for pound a better ghost story on a fraction of the budget afforded big Hollywood genre productions that have been made since. That's not to say it's perfect for it's not Carpenter himself has never been wholly satisfied with the final film this even after reshooting a third of the film after originally making a picture reliant on suggestion over presence but with some smoke machines a synthesiser a game cast and a spooky revenge story on the page he's made a subgenre classic.Carpenter has somehow managed to blend old fashioned ghostly goings on within a modern setting that of a fishing town that proves perfect once the sun goes down and the town tries to sleep. You can practically smell the salt in the sea such is the knack of the director for setting the mood. Then with minimalistic panache the director marries up fog with synth beats to create maximum dread and then he teases perfectly by only letting us glimpse his ghosts as dark figurines making us fill in the blanks as to what they look like where armed with our imagination they prove to be more scary than some CGI enhanced entity created in the blockbuster age. The killings that follow carry a high gruesome factor and we don't need or get buckets of blood for them to impact and the suspense is jacked up so much in the final quarter it proves to be edge of the seat stuff as the spring finally uncoils.Filmed in widescreen to give off a higher end production value which works Carpenter surrounds himself with familiar folk and inserts in jokes and homages that also keep the film grounded and a mile away from Hollywood excess. From character names to Hitchcock stars and references Bodega Bay anyone? the pic feels exactly what it is a film made with love Carpenter even cameos at the start of the film and it is a world away from the smugness of a Shyamalan. Yes there are problems Curtis and Atkins are strangers who meet and in the blink of an eye they are in bed together which looks to be a bad edit while the gathering of principal characters in one place for the finale is a bit of a contrivance. Yet these are minor irritants because The Fog is a film that once loved will always stay loved.

	schema:headline " Forget the Remake. Carpenter's Original Ghost Story is Deeply Chilling.";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching the lacklustre 2005 remake of Carpenter's The Fog I quickly ran to my nearest television set and inserted this DVD into my DVD player just so I can recall the days when horror film's were made without the overuse of annoying CGI.This film along with that other Carpenter film whatsitsname? is a testament to the fact that you do not need a 30 million dollar budget to create an effective scary ghost movie. There is no CGI here only talent mood a great location and a creepy story.The story takes place in Antonio Bay. A depressingly gloomy but charming seaside town whose inhabitants become the victims of a thick glowing fog carrying the angry ghosts of lepers who were killed in a shipwreck a century earlier. What makes this ghost story original in my opinion is that the ghosts depicted here are not transparent floating phantasms that move objects and say boo. They are walking dead guys covered in rags dripping in salt water and armed with knives hooks swords and possibly every other sharp metallic object you can think of and simply slice up their unfortunate victims.The cast is firstrate. The standout performer is Carpenter's then wife Adrienne Barbeau who plays Stevie Wayne. A sexy radio discjockey who becomes trapped inside a lighthouse while the rest of the cast seeks refuge in an old church outside of town. ScreamQueens Jamie Lee Curtis Janet Leigh and Nancy Loomis costar as the other luckless female victims and put their screaming talents to good use. The legendary John Houseman makes a great cameo appearance in the opening sequence setting the creepy tone and the man sure knows how to tell a tale. The great cast the location the creative fog effects and a simple yet effective Carpenter score all contribute in making this low budget chiller a clear winner.However it should be stated that The Fog is not perfect. Despite a chilling first 20 minutes the film takes its time in building its tension and therefore drags a bit. And even those who love this movie will admit that it's not as effective as Carpenter's Halloween and under close inspection plot holes become too apparent. But us fans don't seem to care since we all know that this film is not intended to be taken too seriously. It's about a killer fog for crying out loud. Anyone approaching this for realism needs to reevaluate their criteria for viewing horror movies since many of these genre films are simply made to entertain and to scare the pants off you and if you are a horror fan like I am you should find plenty to like here. By combining several different branches off the horror genre and using it to great effect The Fog is a combination of such classics as Halloween and Night of the Living Dead.So forget all of this CGI stuff for a minute and see what a true horror movie should really be like. The Fog is simple yet deeply chilling and atmospheric. Follow it with Carpenter's ultimate classic you know which movie I'm talking about and double your pleasure.There's a reason why this lowbudget shocker is so beloved by fans of the genre. Recommended.3.5 out of 5.".

	onyx:emotionText "After watching the lacklustre 2005 remake of Carpenter's The Fog I quickly ran to my nearest television set and inserted this DVD into my DVD player just so I can recall the days when horror film's were made without the overuse of annoying CGI.This film along with that other Carpenter film whatsitsname? is a testament to the fact that you do not need a 30 million dollar budget to create an effective scary ghost movie. There is no CGI here only talent mood a great location and a creepy story.The story takes place in Antonio Bay. A depressingly gloomy but charming seaside town whose inhabitants become the victims of a thick glowing fog carrying the angry ghosts of lepers who were killed in a shipwreck a century earlier. What makes this ghost story original in my opinion is that the ghosts depicted here are not transparent floating phantasms that move objects and say boo. They are walking dead guys covered in rags dripping in salt water and armed with knives hooks swords and possibly every other sharp metallic object you can think of and simply slice up their unfortunate victims.The cast is firstrate. The standout performer is Carpenter's then wife Adrienne Barbeau who plays Stevie Wayne. A sexy radio discjockey who becomes trapped inside a lighthouse while the rest of the cast seeks refuge in an old church outside of town. ScreamQueens Jamie Lee Curtis Janet Leigh and Nancy Loomis costar as the other luckless female victims and put their screaming talents to good use. The legendary John Houseman makes a great cameo appearance in the opening sequence setting the creepy tone and the man sure knows how to tell a tale.

I'm not particularly a fan of ghost stories but this is well done and still looks good which is why they keep coming out with DVDs on this film and a recent remake. It's a classic.Unfortunately the remake didn't have the cast this film had. Ladies go first in this original with Adrienne Barbeau in the lead as Stevie Wayne a small town discjockey whose studio is a lighthouse. Wayne has a sexy voice that complements the story and adds a nice touch to it. Then there's the real life motherdaughter duo of Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The male lead is played by someone I am not familiar with Charles Cyphers but he does a fine job. John Houseman gets good billing here but he's only in the film the first three minutes!The star of this film however is the silvery luminescent fog....a specialeffect that was eerie 25 years ago and still has that effect. The films only lasts 90 minutes to the story zips by the violence is effective but not overdone and the suspense is terrific. The only annoying aspect of the film is the typicallyweird theology mumbojumbo with another weak priest Hal Holbrook in this case shown. Hollywood loves showing priests who are pathetic. The rest of the movie is fun to watch.".

We can't expect our beloved horror movies from the 70's and 80's to hold up forever and The Fog has become a little dated over time.The Fog is very scenic and has a great ensemble cast including Adrienne Barbeau Jamie Lee Curtis Janet Leigh Jamie's real life mother and a small cameo by John Houseman just to name a few.I particularly liked the premise of Jamie Lee Curtis's character Elizabeth Solley a solo hitchhiker on her way to Vancouver who gets picked up by local resident Nick Castle Tom Atkins sleeps with him the first night they meet and then never leaves his side through the rest of the movie as the terror of The Fog unfolds. Boy you just HAVE to love the 80's!!! The small coastal town of Antonio Bay is celebrating it's 100 year anniversary. However also 100 years ago a ship sailed along its shores and a curse was born. Unbeknownst to the new residents the sailors of that vessel have come back walking through the nightly glowing fog to kill and avenge the loss of the treasure that was stolen from them.I won't say more as not to give the movie away. For nostalgic purposes this film is definitely worth a viewing. If it's been a very long time since you've watched The Fog and you don't remember it all too well as was the case with me it's worth a second look indeed.The Fog is not bloodbathslasher horror but it does make for a good spooky late night film. With the current remake currently in production and to be released by 1005 what better time to revisit the original!!Recommend!".

My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching The Fog one night around dusk with my cousin.It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say I was terrified.The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death.The Fog is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens offscreen which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of What you don't see is scarier than what you do. It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today.The Fog is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.".

Further a group of conspirators including his grandfather lighted the fire to sink Elizabeth Dane and robber Blake's fortune and now the ghosts of Blake and his crew are seeking for revenge on the locals.The Fog is a dark ghost story of this master of horror John Carpenter who deserves an Oscar his great filmography. The cinematography and special effects are great giving a scary atmosphere without the need of gore. It is nice to see again a gorgeous twentythree years old Jamie Lee Curtis acting with her mother Janet Leigh. The screenplay builds the horror in a low pace but increasing the tension. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Bruma Assassina The Assassin Fog".

John Carpenter and Debra Hill did a fine job with this one.The good points of the movie deal with the overall story and the setting of the film.  The story is explained fully during the movie and the setting in California is superb and creepy.  The music is also disturbing.  The background music coupled with the uneasiness and lonliness of the town Antonio Bay is very effective.  No gore whatsoever in this one so the whole family may watch this movie together.  When I was about 10 or 11 years old this movie did scare me quite a bit.  The only negative was the characterization.  No character development at all but that was probably intended.  Jamie Lee Curtis's role is strange.  Some references to Halloween are also found in the film.  i.e.  Look out for the name of one of the main characters.Overall a good movie.  Not great but good.  6 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The small coastal town of Antonio Bay is celebrating its 100th year since being founded. However the residents are not aware of the tragic history of their small town and think nothing of the wider significance of the date as they prepare for a big party they don't even put together all the strange things that start happening on the day itself. However when a small boat is lost in a dense fog that contains a mysterious ship some residents begin to suspect something more sinister than meteorology is at work.With a remake in the cinemas and the fact that I had just returned from the coast of northern California I thought I'd revisit The Fog having not seen it for almost 15 years. Trading on the very hallmarks that made John Carpenter famous before he couldn't buy a hit movie The Fog is an effective chiller even if it won't scare those accustomed to more gory modern fare. Quite short and to the point the film makes good use of the fog to draw tension out of every scene and overcomes the potential silliness of a smoke machine working overtime behind the scenes. Instead the tension is consistent and produces a good few jumps and build ups along the way the ghosts are kept well hidden so that the limited effects don't undermine them by totally exposing them. Carpenter uses his usual minimalist electronic score to good effect playing it low and constant like a heartbeat.The famous cast help the convincing atmosphere and do more than just run and scream. Barbeau leads the cast well from the solitude of her lighthouse and she helps keep the tension up with her delivery. Curtis and Leigh both have smaller roles but they add class to the film and they do scared well. Atkins makes for a good male lead and he gets solid help from Holbrook and a few others in supporting roles. The zombie creatures move slowly but are a good presence.Overall this is a solid chiller from the days when Carpenter seemed to know what he was doing. The low budget effects are covered up by solid delivery and a consistently tense atmosphere which is supported by convincing performances and Carpenter's usual low steady consistent score.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly fun!";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't say I suspected much from the previews.  I anticipated another lame comedy and a cheap imitation of Men in Black.  Evolution can be compared to MIB in certain aspects but it breaks new ground.I can't give a really scientific review because quite frankly I was too busy laughing to weigh out the pros and cons.  This is a great popcorn movie!  Metaphorically speaking I was eating nachos There are scary moments involving slimy creatures so chances are if there are any females with youthey will be clinging onto your arms.  Ivan Reitman is the famed director of the Ghostbusters movies and Evolution has much of the same charm and quirky sense of style and humor. David Duchovny who really has a good sense of humor offcamera but happens to get stuck with mostly serious roles is terrific in a looser role that enables him to flaunt his knack for comedy.  Of course Orlando Jones is the funniest in the bunch.  He has a terrific scene in which a bug crawls inside his skin and doctors have to get it out...rectally.  I have to say that was the highlight of this offbeat comedy and had me on the floor!  Julianne Moore plays the clumsy assistant.  I can't say I found her role all that humorous.  Her pratfalls are pretty lame and predictable.  But that minor hint of cheap slapstick didn't ruin the overall experience. Evolution is great fun from start to finish a very interesting finish with an innovative product placement!  Sure it's all lowbrow but it works and the crude humor is tamed down to a tolerant level Well compared to the average contemporary comedy.  This is not a movie to be studied or analyzed or discussed for hours at a time.  Just sit back and HAVE SOME FUN!!!  Because chances are considering previous 2001 releases you won't be having this much fun at the movies in quite a while.  I could be wrong but better to be safe than sorry.My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first read about Evolution the latest scifi scheme to come from DreamWorks I was interested.  A story about aliens with humor not bad. Then when I read that Ivan Reitman the BEST comedic director of the 80's and one of the best of all time was at the helm I was thrilled.  I mean come on after he was given duds like Father's Day' and Six Days Seven Nights' to work with isn't it about time that Hollywood gave him a project worth while I won't even mention the bombastic disaster of Junior'oh I just did?It begins with the introduction of Scott's character Wayne Green a wannabe fireman practicing for his fireman final questionable at first hilarious in the end.  Then he gets an unexpected visitor  a meteor carrying alien organisms hits the heart of the Arizona desert. After a community college science professor Ira Kane Duchovny working with one screwed up screen nameand his eccentric geologist buddy Harry Block Jones discover the meteor they find that the bleeding' rock starts to create these weird alien creatures and soon they begin to multiply.  Kane's nemeses Gen. Woodman Levine and the military get involved things get too outofcontrol so it's up to the teaming of Kane Block Green and government scientist Allison Reed Moore to stop the evolution.If you're a Reitman fan the plot of this could make you go in expecting some kind of tribute to both Ghostbusters'.  In a way it is and is that a bad thing?  Hell no!  If you liked or even loved like me Ghostbusters' I can bet my clean pair of boxers that you'll get a hoot out of Evolution'. But of course any film must maintain some distance from the films its being compared too and Evolution' does that.  The characters and situations are different atmospherically.  Duchovny turns in a cool' performance by that meaning he wasn't Mr. Badass or Mr. LaughaMinute he was just well Duchovny and that itself is always pleasing to watch.  Jones is his usual funny self delivering some funny lines. Moore's ability to do just about anything comes in handy here playing the hottieyetclumsy love interest. Scott's acting resembles the other roles he's done in the past and I've come to appreciate that that thing he does w his eyebrow is getting funnier every time.  Can't say the same for Levine his clich performance as the badguywhodoesn'tlisten character gets annoying fast.A lot of the film makes me question what it is and really what it could have been.  The script penned by three writers was originally written as a scifi THRILLER not a scifi comedy.  There were a lot of laughs but because of the script's origin there could have been more.  But considering the script was originally a scifi thriller the filmmakers including Reitman did a great job.  Can't say much for the ending though the ending looks and feels like a meshedup result of whatcouldhavebeen and from that mushiness the filmmakers poked at and took at least some of the good elements.  Thank god the film is a comedy if it was its original idea the ending would have been disastrous.Evolution' is a overall crowdpleaser with nice special effects and makeup those dead aliens looked great.  It's a few laughs and comedic situations short of comedic greatness but look on the bright sideReitman is back in his lovable kickass form.  He's tapped into the present and how most comedies are made but he didn't dare forget his roots there is a sequence in the film where Duchovny Jones and Scott chase down a flying creature in a mall.  The three equipped with shotguns dispose of it in true Ghostbusters style.  And with me being a big Ghostbusters fan I fell in love with the it plus its the best scene in the film. The trio singing after their battle nice touch.GRADE B".

	schema:reviewBody "Evolution starring David Duchovny Orlando Jones Seann William Scott and Julianne Moore is a terrific fun summer romp. A meteorite crashes to Earth bringing with it microscopic alien organisms that rapidly begin evolving and threaten humanity's very existence. Enter our heroes two community college science professors Ira Kane Duchovny and Harry Block Jones. They investigate the meteorite take samples and Kane quickly realizes what is going on. But the Army has been monitoring Kane's work ever since he was drummed out of the USAMRID because of a tremendous mistake he made.

	schema:reviewBody "The first thing to say is that this review is written by a nonAmerican. This is to say that a different set of principals are brought to bear on the subject matter. I'm sure that other in the U.S and around the world willand haveexpressed opinions but this one comes from a whole other country. Evolution is a very enjoyable film. It has been made in a summer of super event movies and filmgame conversions and I feel stands alone as the only comedy with an original source material in scifi anyway.It is highly enjoyable. If you're paying 5 pounds or 8.50 you need to find a film that refreshes your sentiments with regards to just what a big money film should be. As I sit here smoking a cigarette and drinking a 7up I figure this film to be a winner. The principals act in a manner appropriate to the subject material and although Mr. Duchovny is not a comedy actor I feel he acquits himself admirably in an unfamiliar field. Mr. Jones is a relative newcomer to the cinema and I reckon that over time he may very well ascend to the the same esteemed level as Eddie Murphy or his latterday composite of sorts Will Smith.The plot is most sound and although it draws some comparisons to Ghostbusters as other critics have noted it stands alone as Summer 2001's most original comedy event movie. Mr Reitman a veteran knows how to make films play easily is one of the few directors who knows how to use good comedy actors. With this in mind no one is underused perhaps with the one exception of Mr. Dan Aykroyd nowadays underrated for some insane reason but who is extremely talented. It's a shame that Aykroyd's presence as a big man is more valued then his acting talent because he's always a delight to watch.To cut in some sourness there's not a lot of involvement with the central characters and you do find yourself watching people being cheated into a state of reaction at the expense of the colourful effects but that's the way it was made and we can't change that.In all I would recommend this film to the less morose viewer as it's cheerful colourful and does not require an overcritical view. Watch it and the hell with the printed criticism  you'll enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me say this I was never a fan of Ghostbusters.  I guess I never got in on the bandwagon on that one.  I never found it to be as funny as a lot of people tons of people actually found it.  I thought parts of it were cool like the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man but most of the movie was too drab for me for some reason.  Someday I'll write a review of it but I'm too lazy to do it right now.  Why am I talking about Ghostbusters when I'm reviewing Evolution some of you ask?  Well it's simple.  The same man directs both movies Ivan Reitman and both movies have very similar plots.  Except that in my opinion Evolution is better.  Basically think of Evolution as a remake of Ghostbusters only throw out the ghosts and put in aliens which I like because aliens in my opinion are cooler and more realistic than ghosts.Let me mention some bad stuff just to get it over with because I have to do at some point.  This movie misses some serious opportunities to be funny. Sometimes when you are expecting a joke there is none.  It's almost as if they really weren't trying.  Sometimes the jokes are a little corny.One last bad note some of the aliens suck.  The ending alien is a bit of a let down.  It kind of reminded me of Akira if you've seen that movie. There is also this cute alien who turns out to be nasty via the mouth within a mouth a la Ridley Scott's Alien.Now on to some good stuff.  This movie is really funny in a happy kind of way.  I compare the mood of this movie to another Dreamworks aliencomedy Galaxy Quest a movie I thought was hilarious.  If you liked Galaxy Quest and I think most people did then you will like Evolution.Something else I would like to point out is how scientific Evolution is. The movie seems very intelligent as far as talking about how the aliens evolve.  I for one and happy to see a movie that isn't completely dumbed down for the uneducated.  I like alien stuff and space stuff so this kind of science interests me.  Overall I found Evolution to be very intriguing apart from being funny.Oh I want to mention Orlando Jones.  He's the black guy from those 7Up commercials.  I love this guy.  He steals the show in this movie.  I knew the guy was great ever since I saw the first of those 7Up commercials.  He was also in the Replacements that lame football comedy which was also somewhat entertaining and he's probably been in some other stuff I haven't seen or can't remember.  But let me tell you this guy is going places.  As for the other actors they're decent.  I like the touch of having David Duchovny on board.  Julian Moore is a good actress but she got shafted in the character department.  She has a basic walking cardboard cutout character with little personality.  Oh well.In conclusion please do me a favor of not going into this movie expecting a great movie.  Why do people do that?  Every movie can't be the Godfather or 2001 or Saving Private Ryan so why don't you just shut up and enjoy the movie.  You won't look back at Evolution at the end of the summer as you favorite summer movie this year but you're not supposed to.  Evolution was made to be entertaining not great.  It was made to give you your money's worth and put forth an enjoyable show.  I think it accomplishes its mission.710".

Orlando Jones was absolutely hilarious who knew the 7up guy could act so well while David Duchovny added that off the wall dry humor which blended perfectly with Jones. And then to top it off Julianne Moore's from Hannibal character was hysterical in an offbeat style as well.  As for Sean William Scott he basically played the same role he usually plays in all of his movies the idiot but nobody in acting pulls that off as well as he does.  He's a riot!  Granted this movie is not Saving Private Ryan or The Green Mile but for a cheesy comedy that is just supposed to make you laugh it's at the top of it's genre.The movie deals with an asteroid which strikes the Earth but it is no ordinary asteroid.  This asteroid brought single cells with it but for some reason these cells are multiplying at a high rate of speed.  As time goes on the cells become more advanced evolving from single celled organisms to multicelled organisms and so forth.  Don't get the wrong idea though this movie is more about just being funny than it is about scifi or even evolution for that matter.

	schema:headline " Terrible";
	schema:reviewBody "Seldom does one see a film so awful. Even Baby Geniuses wasn't this bad. Duchovny's comic timing is terrible and the witty repartee that one normally finds in buddy movies such as this is completely lacking between Duchovny and Orlando Jones it's absolutely amazing watch this movie and you'll see that there is zero chemistry between the main characters. I wonder if this was deliberate.Here's one reason this movie doesn't make any sense a meteor crashes to earth and a community college instructor and his buddy discover that life is evolving from the meteor. So now that the most astounding scientific discovery in thousands of years has happened right under their noses what happens? They casually go about their normal routine taking students on a field trip to visit the meteor sitting around chatting basically ignorant of the miracle that is happening under their very noses. It's so stupid it just wouldn't happen like this unless the main characters were made out to be stupid in the first place but Reitman doesn't take this angle. He plays it seriously like a black comedy but then pulls out something stupid like the golf course dude falling asleep at his fireman exam. The characters aren't well defined at all. Why should I care about any of them Reitman doesn't take the time to flesh them out he seems to be ridiculing their superficiality while simultaneously starving them of the witty dialogue necessary to pull off a black comedy. The result is a mishmash of facial expressions and clichs mined from one hundred years of comedy and vaudeville all thrown together in an attempt to get something to stick. It's like taking everything in your refrigerator and mixing it all together and hoping it will taste good.It doesn't.I'll echo the sentiments of another reviewer who said the film lost him when they were taking the mosquito thing out of Jones.

	onyx:emotionText "Seldom does one see a film so awful. Even Baby Geniuses wasn't this bad. Duchovny's comic timing is terrible and the witty repartee that one normally finds in buddy movies such as this is completely lacking between Duchovny and Orlando Jones it's absolutely amazing watch this movie and you'll see that there is zero chemistry between the main characters. I wonder if this was deliberate.Here's one reason this movie doesn't make any sense a meteor crashes to earth and a community college instructor and his buddy discover that life is evolving from the meteor. So now that the most astounding scientific discovery in thousands of years has happened right under their noses what happens? They casually go about their normal routine taking students on a field trip to visit the meteor sitting around chatting basically ignorant of the miracle that is happening under their very noses. It's so stupid it just wouldn't happen like this unless the main characters were made out to be stupid in the first place but Reitman doesn't take this angle. He plays it seriously like a black comedy but then pulls out something stupid like the golf course dude falling asleep at his fireman exam. The characters aren't well defined at all. Why should I care about any of them Reitman doesn't take the time to flesh them out he seems to be ridiculing their superficiality while simultaneously starving them of the witty dialogue necessary to pull off a black comedy. The result is a mishmash of facial expressions and clichs mined from one hundred years of comedy and vaudeville all thrown together in an attempt to get something to stick. It's like taking everything in your refrigerator and mixing it all together and hoping it will taste good.It doesn't.I'll echo the sentiments of another reviewer who said the film lost him when they were taking the mosquito thing out of Jones. If that isn't bad enough Jones hops up and threatens the doctor never to do that again. So? Next time the doctor will just leave the insect inside of him? This movie is painfully stupid.";

It is always nice to see Julianne Moore and she shows her comic side at its best.  Her portrayal of Alison Reed the clumsy scientist from the Center for Disease Control is probably her best comedic turn to date. David Duchovny is out chasing aliens again and in some ways spoofs his XFiles' character he was a good bit of casting.  He has good comic timing and his deadpan delivery is perfect for the character.  He and Ms Moore have good screen chemistry and it would be nice to see them together again.More directors need to think of Orlando Jones when casting films  He really can act and while the material in Evolution' doesn't offer too many opportunities to do so he takes the chances he is given and runs with them. Seann William Scott Wayne Green has the nottoobright good guy' role down letterperfect.  He has some of the better lines in the movie and remembering that this is a farce is probably the most believable character in the movie.The location photography is at times dazzling however some of the special effects looked very cheesy  very obvious green screen' shots  so obvious that I wondered if they were bad on purpose.  Unfortunately the sound track detracts from the overall end product it seldom had anything to do with the action on the screen and sometimes was outright annoying.This is a good summer movie  just go laugh and don't think too much.".

This sophomoric aliensvs.humans comedy with XFiles defector David Duchovny battling carnivorous extraterrestrials never evolves beyond its amoebic humor its cretinous characters and its Petri dish deep plot. Indeed campy 1950s Bmovie scifi classics like The Giant Gila Monster or The Killer Shrews deliver more laughs per minute than this feeble uninspired potboiler. Okay some of the grossout gags may prompt a snicker but you won't split your sides howling with hilarity like you might have done at Reitman's original Ghostbusters. Imagine a Ghostbusters trio of heroes combating aliens gone AWOL from Men In Black Tremors Gremlins and Jurassic Park and you have a fairly accurate idea how wholly derivative and hopelessly predictable this lame creature feature is. Basically Reitman stages these life and death exploits as if they constituted multimillion dollar Saturday Night Live skits.The prefabricated screenplay by Don Vampires Jakoby David The Family Man Diamond  David Weissman opens one night when goofy firefighter wannabe Wayne Green Sean William Scott of American Pie sets an empty shack ablaze in the desert and practices his rescue routine with a lifesized female dummy. Suddenly a fiery meteor plunges from the heavens obliterates the shack hurls Wayne's car two hundred feet into the sky and crashes outofsight in a cavern! Duchovny stars as Professor Ira Kane a disgraced exArmy scientist now teaching biology at Glen Canyon Community College in Arizona. It seems the Pentagon gave Ira the boot after platoons of troops contracted dire side effects like diarrhea blindness facial paralysis and hair loss when he inoculated them. Meanwhile Kane's colleague Professor Harry Block Orlando Jones divides his time between geology lectures and coaching the girls' volleyball team. Kane and Block gather asteroid samples. Staring into a microscope an alarmed Kane watches these singlecell organisms evolve at an unearthly rate. Kane tells Block What took us 200 million years has taken them only a few hours. Without warning the U.S. Army commandeers the investigation banishes our protagonists from the premises confiscates their research and summons attractive CDC epidemiologist Dr. Allison Reed Julianne Moore of Hannibal who has a clumsy habit of falling down wherever she walks. Gradually the slimy creatures acclimate themselves to Earth's ecosystem and behave like predators. Despicable Army General Russell Woodman Ted Levine of Silence of the Lambs decides to napalm them. Unfortunately our heroes learn too late these monsters react to napalm like Gremlins to bathing after midnight.Not only does David Duchovny lack Bill Murray's comedic genius but also he cannot pass up any opportunity to spoof his Agent Mulder persona. Meanwhile Orlando Jones of Bedazzled suffers a far worse fate. He submits reluctantly to an anal probe when an alien burrows under his skin then later finds himself administering a shampoo enema to a gargantuan monster to destroy it!

	schema:reviewBody "Sabotage is one of Alfred Hitchcock's least known features but it is part of a string of fine films he made during his last few years in England and is well worth watching for any Hitchcock or thriller fan.  The picture is based on a classic novel by the great PolishEnglish writer Joseph Conrad.This is a tense atmospheric thriller without much humor.  It is more like Vertigo I Confess or The Birds than North By Northwest or The 39 Steps.  Instead of humor Hitchcock concentrates this time on carefully constructing the world of the Verlocs the family at the center of the film. The setting in a movie theater where the family works and lives is an important part of the themes and questions explored in the film.The characters are constantly walking in and out of the theater while movies are in progress or discussing the movies being shown as they go about the main actions of the actual film.  The obvious themes of appearance and reality parallel the lives of the Verloc family and especially Mr. Verloc Oskar Homolka whom we know from the beginning to be a terrorist albeit an amateurish one and not the mildmannered family man he appears to be. The settings of Verloc's meeting with his coconspirators an aquarium and a bird shop are also carefully chosen to demonstrate the contrast between the everyday appearance of the terrorists and their actual agendas.  Besides the obvious implication that such persons may be those we would not suspect there is also the strong suggestion that these conspirators do not themselves realize the serious nature of the game they are playing. Certainly Verloc himself quickly realizes that he is in over his head and he tries desperately to get out of the fearsome responsibilities he has accepted.Hitchcock buffs will enjoy watching the film repeatedly to catch all of the carefully crafted detail and to enjoy the trademark Hitchcock touches. There are two particularly riveting sequences.  One occurs when Verloc sends his wife's young unsuspecting brother on a dangerous errand leading to a sequence of excruciating tension.  Hitchcock later said he should have ended the sequence differently and many viewers might agree but what happens is in keeping with the themes and plot of the movie and the suspense sequence is also masterfully done.  Also wellknown from Sabotage is the sequence when Mrs. Verloc Sylvia Sidney learns the truth about her husband's activities and the awful consequences of his latest plot.  There is first a touching sequence in the theater when the Disney movie playing on the screen first provokes Mrs. Verloc to involuntary laughter then to deepened sadness when it too closely parallels her own experience.  Then there is a tense famous scene at the dinner table filmed as an absolutely masterful montage by Hitchcock.These scenes and the finely crafted atmosphere of Sabotage make it worthwhile despite a few small faults and despite the possibility that many viewers will not be comfortable with some of the plot developments.  Watch it at least once if you are a Hitchcock fan or if you like spy stories or thrillers.".

	schema:headline " A Great Sylvia Sidney Vehicle before Beetlejuice";
	schema:reviewBody "Like most Hitchcock films Sabotage is a great thriller directed with a fluid selfassured style. But given its thriller genre what makes Sabotage unique is that moments into the movie we know the identity of the saboteur we know who is the undercover detective and we know that the police have all but solved the case. So Hitchcock's suspense must come from somewhere else and in the meantime he must entertain us with character development. And that task falls to his heroine. Hitchcock had an uncanny ability to cast actresses who were a perfect fit at that exact point of their career to play a particular heroine. Fortunately he again makes the right choice and we are treated to a fine performance from Sylvia Sidney imagine an expressive Sasha Cohen without ice skates.The film is essentially a Sylvia Sidney vehicle as she plays a woman who slowly realizes that her husband is a monster. She is a young American woman who married an older European nationality unknown man who apparently showed kindness to her and her young brother Stevie played by Desmond Tester when they were down on their luck. They moved to London to run the Bijou a struggling movie house.Among the notable scenes is the meeting between Sidney's husband played by Oskar Homolka and a spy contact at the London aquarium to the backdrop of a huge turtle swimming in an illuminated tank. The tank crossdissolves into Piccadilly Circus as it is demolished in his imagination.Another is late in the film when Sidney sits in the theater in numb shock watching a Disney cartoon   Who Killed Cock Robin ? . There is not a word of dialogue but her eyes and expressions subtly convey an emotional cavalcade of stunned realization immense sadness and barely suppressed hysteria that will stay in your memory forever. It is a rare example of the visual power of film and an illustration of what acting for the camera is all about.And perhaps most amazing is the long and unbearably suspenseful journey of young brother Stevie across London unaware that he's carrying a ticking time bomb.".

	schema:reviewBody "French intellectuals probably love Sabotage Story and pace might not hold the interest of the general public for long but this movie is a multi layered affair with a lot of stuff to analyze. I read Joseph Conrad's sadly prophetic novel about terrorism in our modern day world before I knew that a Hitchcock treatment existed and I just admire how the master of suspense succeeded in adapting the story written around the year 1900 to the conditions in Hitchcockland. There is suspense there are funny scenes but Sabotage is compared with The Man Who Knew Too Much or The 39 steps a rather serious movie that investigates the dark sides of the condition of human nature in modern times. There are different particularities that I think are quite unique and worth a comment.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADCertain parts of Sabotage seem to pay tribute to the silent era expressionist and avant garde heritage of Germany and the Soviet Union. The movie starts in an impressive unforgettable way First we see a dictionary then Battersea Power Station with one smoking chimney in the moonlight then a gaudily lit city street at night. The lights in the street go out change to a piece of big machinery half in water lit only by a flashlight several hands excitedly fussing with the machinery digging up a muddy substance from the water rubbing the substance between the fingers. Then the first words of the movie are spoken by an anonymous voice Sand!. Then another voice Sabotage!. Then a third voice Who did it? With a quick succession of different scenes  partially accompanied with a nasty humming sound like from a generator  the viewer is brought right into the movie. The audience is now informed about the dark nature of the subject  terrorism  and the wanted atmosphere is firmly established.The use of spaces or spatial sequences is extraordinary. They have a symbolic significance that in my opinion is uncommon in later Hitchcock movies. The main character Mr. Verloc operates a  small shoddy movie theatre the Bijou. He lives together with his young wife and her brother in a small appartment behind the movie screen. Whoever wants to visit the Verlocs walks up to the ridiculously pompuous brightly lit front of the Bijou passes through the front into the dark stuffy small screening room walks towards the screen passes it and is at the Verloc's door. Mr. Verloc a twisted character without discernible ethnic or ethical roots executes acts of sabotage or terrorism for whoever pays him. The sequence of light and darkness that lead from the outside to the brain that concocts acts of madness  is repeatedly shown in the movie. A detective tries to squeeze himself into the space behind the screen in an attempt to spy but there he is unprotected and spotted by the people in the appartment. At the end of the movie  Mrs. Verloc fleeing from the appartment when she understands that Mr. Verloc caused her brother's death gets stuck in the dream zone of the screening room. She stops and watches a sequence of a Disney animated picture somehow re  enacting her brothers carefree life and its brutal end. The movie in the movie makes her state of distress more acute. She turns back to the appartment and finally stabs Mr. Verloc to death. A similar spatial sequence as in the Bijou is shown in a pet shop. In its back room a bomb is prepared for Mr. Verloc by the owner an equally miserable and twisted character. Again there is a respectable front a middle zone with a surreal situation many caged exotic animals and a stuffy back room for a chaotic unconventional family of three in this case father daughter granddaughter where modernday sciences are turned into a senseless destructive force. The meeting between Mr. Verloc and his anonymous employers as in Conrad's novel it is never explained who they are and in whose favor the acts of terrorism should be takes place in the zoo in a dark cavern with windows into different aquarium I strongly suspect Orson Welles of having copied the set with few alterations for The Lady from Shanghai. The conspiracy thus takes places in a subterranean commando bunker a predecessor of Ken Adam's war room from which you do not see a clearly defined battlefield but just murky waters and strange silent creatures moving through space in slow motion. In a short dream like sequence the scared Mr. Verloc sees through one of the aquarium windows Piccadilly Circus distorted and destroyed by the bomb he is ordered to plant there.In Sabotage the sets are very important. The character's lives are conditioned by their surroundings. They move little. There is not too much action and the viewers of the movie are required to watch carefully. Maybe this is Hitchcock at his most uncommercial ...".

	schema:reviewBody "What an opening. The power goes off all over London as the camera gives the viewer a sweeping panorama of the situation light shadow blackness panning throughout the city with emphasis on historical sites. Then one word utterances from several different persons in charge of keeping the power up and running. This beginning grabs the audience's attention better than any other film this side of The Letter and Hitchcock's own Rebecca. But unlike The Letter where the opening is the high point of the entire film Sabotage keeps getting better and better. The opening is truly just the beginning of a cinema masterpiece. Hitchcock uses old film techniques such as cross cutting in novel ways. One of the best scenes takes place in a zoo aquarium where water creatures are compared with the human creature. Listen to the dialog between the two saboteurs as the camera zooms in on the sea turtles. Later the bomber thinks of the fish swimming in the tank and then sees motor cars filled with passengers speeding along the streets. An explosion. Suddenly the fish in the tank again flash through the bomber's head. To savor this splendid moment of cinematic brilliance the viewer may need to zip back and watch and listen as the scene is repeated.What a wonderful acting job Sylvia Sidney does. Hitchcock used all his influence and bargaining power to have Sidney play the part. Unfortunately Hitchcock and Sidney did not jell. Their personalities clashed. So the gifted actress refused to have anything else to do with the masterful director. Such a great loss for each.The way Hitchcock handles the delicate situation involving the cute boy Mrs. Verloc's Sylvia Sidneylittle brother riding the bus with a time bomb in a package under one arm while petting a fluffy puppy with his free hand is necessary for what happens at the end of the film. For once however Hitchcock misread his movie patrons who were outraged. Never again would he make a similar mistake.An interesting feature of this Hitchcock outing is a cinema owned by the bomber Oskar Homolka and his wife Sidney where clandestine meetings among the saboteurs occur. Several features are shown in the background from time to time during the film but one stands out Who Killed Cock Robin a Disney short from 1935 featuring a parody of Mae West among others. Hitchcock skillfully blends the clip from Cock Robin into his story of Sabotage. Mrs. Verloc deeply depressed and confused following her brother's death hears the laughter coming from the audience. She sits down and joins in with the gaiety. When the arrow is loosed and strikes poor Cock Robin the laughter on her face changes to an expression of agony and terror. Reality replaces fantasy and make believe. Now she fully realizes what a monster her husband truly is not the noble sensitive caring man of her dreams. One is reminded how a later directorwriter Preston Sturges would use a similar technique with a Mickey Mouse cartoon in his classic Sullivan's Travels.There is also a clear message by Hitchcock on sabotage today terrorism those socalled martyrs for a cause are in reality misguided devils who end up killing the innocent and helpless instead of the ones their feeble minds believe to be the deceivers and exploiters of the human race.".

The main character is an undercover agent looking to break up a ring of saboteurs bent on destroying London.  Hitch places the head villain within what else a cinema something that adds to the already rich atmosphere.

They reveal a lot to us the viewer and lead us to hope for his wife to figure it all out.  An ominous image of London falling is depicted from the point of view of Oscar.  This is pretty basic stuff but considering how old the film is it still packs a punch.  The scene on the bus where a young boy carries a film tin which may or may not carry a bomb is extremely suspenseful and welldone.  We even see a British crowd in the movie theater watching a Disney flick which is well noted in the opening credits.1934's THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH was an effective early thriller better than the 1956 remake however this is the film to start with if studying Hitchcock's career.  You may find yourself preferring some of his British films like MAN WHO KNEW to his work in Hollywood.  SABOTAGE provides the goods for the first time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah yet another Hitchcock movie that is less than famous but then turns out to be one of the best films ever made. Every Hitchcock film that I see just makes me want to the rest of his films.Sabotage has a lot going for it. It is based on a novella by Joseph Conrad the master writer who wrote Heart of Darkness truth be told that's the only novel of his that I've read the whole of but I've been told that he has plenty of great novels besides that I guess after Sabotage I'm now obliged to read up. The story is excellent. Mix that with great characters played by great actors and you've got yourself yet another Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece.Maybe this film is not popular because it is atypical for Hitchcock. It contains tons of suspense maybe more than any of his films besides Rear Window especially in a sequence where he demonstrates his famous theory that a bomb that does not go off creates the suspense. No this film is atypical because it lacks Hitchcock's masterful humor. This is usually taken as one of his trademarks but I've seen several of his films that lack humor or at least reduce it and I find them just as good I Confess Rope and The Birds. Instead Sabotage may be the most emotionally affecting Hitchcock film competing with the likes of Vertigo and Rebecca. It gives you characters to care about especially Mrs. Verloc played masterfully by Sylvia Sydney as a happy wife who discovers the hard way that her husband is a terrorist don't worry no spoilers here we find this out in the first scene. John Loder plays Ted a detective who falls in love with Mrs. Verloc although she is clearly not willing while undercover at a grocer next door. The best performance is Oskar Homolka's who plays Mr. Verloc. Only Norman Bates is a more sympathetic villain than Mr. Verloc. We never do see why exactly he wants to sabotage things and in this way this movie is quite xenophobic but we see that he does not wish to harm anyone and that when he does he only does it through compulsion. He also cares greatly for his wife and her brother. Even at the end of the film we understand why Mrs. Verloc wants nothing to do with Ted's advances. The film ends with an easy escape but guilt remains heavy. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "A boy an old lady and a puppy on a bus. What could possibly be a sweeter film scene? Well that is unless you're Alfred Hitchcock and the film is Sabotage in which case you get a trifecta of quite a different sort.Playing with the rules was Hitchcock's forte but never again until Psycho would he do so with the cold brilliance on display here. Unlike Psycho which hasn't dated a month since its 1960 release Sabotage doesn't for a moment feel like it was made any later than 1936 in part because of its fuzzy sound quality maybe just the versions I've seen and in part because it's a very static film.That's not to say Sabotage isn't good. In fact it's brilliant. Adapted from the Joseph Conrad novel The Secret Agent but markedly better both in terms of its linear treatment of the thin central story and its sharper more measured ending Sabotage introduces us to Mr. Verloc Oskar Homolka the owner of a London cinema who sidelines as a secret agent for a mysterious foreign power the people you and I will never catch as one policeman tells another. After causing a power outage that produces laughter rather than the desired fear Verloc is assigned a more deadly job to cause an explosion in Piccadilly Circus the center of the world as Verloc's controller calls it.It's impossible to watch the film now without thinking of 911 or the London subway bombings a world of murderous anarchic terrorism Conrad's novel and Hitchcock's film anticipated without quite comprehending. The film seems to stumble on offering a coherent why perhaps because there isn't one then or now. But echoing a central point in Conrad's novel Sabotage shows the terrorists' greatest fear is not retribution but indifference. London must not laugh is the order given to Verloc.As played by Homolka with sleepy nuance Verloc isn't quite a villain just a weak lazy man of no moral fiber who objects at the thought of murder but decides to go through with it in order to be paid. Sgt. Spencer of Scotland Yard is hot on Verloc's trail but he's not exactly a hero a bit of a bumbler rather who fancies Verloc's wife. Mrs. Verloc played by screen vet Sylvia Sidney she was the case worker helping the Maitlands in the afterlife in Beetle Juice 52 years later is the closest we have to a rooting interest though her concern seems less with the husband or the policeman who woos her than her little brother Stevie Desmond Tester.Hitchcock's direction offers a little of the comic relief more prominent in his other films and some arresting visuals for their time especially that of a fish tank which morphs into a London street under attack. There's a very involving scene where a devastated Mrs. Verloc is reduced to tearful laughter by a Disney cartoon. Verloc's owning a cinema may be a comment on the deceptively transformative power of cinema or a wink in the direction of his sideline activity in the novel selling Edwardian porn. Mostly Sabotage is a film that grabs you by the throat and never lets go making its 80minute running time feel like forever going by in an instant.It all comes down to the scene on the bus. Hitchcock apparently believed it was the biggest mistake in his career. It may have killed enthusiasm for Sabotage but it made clear to filmgoers that all bets were off as far as this young director was concerned. From then on cliffhangers would be invested with a certain added dread that would make their resolutions seem less pat and the movie thriller would be that much more thrilling. It took guts to make a film like that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sabotage is one of a series of six films in the mid 1930s that firmly created the public image of Alfred Hitchcock as a major film director and artist. The others were The Man Who Knew Too Much 1934 The Secret Agent The ThirtyNine Steps Young and Innocent and The Lady Vanishes. The films caught attention in American especially The ThirtyNine Steps and The Lady Vanishes and Hitchcock was invited to come to America by David Selznick who would be his producer from 1939 onward.The other comments on this film have pointed out some of the best moments such as the explosion scene and the death of Verloc Oskar Homolka. The film was quite well made but the film had to be modernized for it's 1937 audiences. Although the foreign power that is behind Homolka's gang is never mentioned a 1937 audience would have probably considered it was Nazi Germany which was the suggested enemy in The Lady Vanishes and The ThirtyNine Steps. In the original story Verloc is acting for the government of Tsarist Russia who has sent a high ranking official to London to tell Verloc to commit a terrorist act to spur antiImmigrant feelings in London. Verloc does not run a cinema as in the movie  the novel came out in 1907 but a small store. However he does sell contraceptive devices which Conrad hints at but doesn't name. Verloc lives in a fool's paradise with his wife Winnie and her simpleminded brother. He thinks that his wife adores him but she only tolerates him for the sake of giving her brother a home. When Verloc's plan destroys the brother it destroys the household. Verloc's world is that of the foreign anarchists in London none of whom are worthy of the respect their breast beating comments make them think they deserve. One of them is at total war with society and wears an outfit that a modern suicide bomber would not find amiss this character is kept in the film but his impact is reduced by script changes. In the novel when this brave anarchist goes out into the public wearing his boobytrapped coat he suddenly sees the vast multitudes in the street and realizes that no matter how many he kills or maims thousands and millions will replace them  and nobody will replace him! Conrad's The Secret Agent was called the most completely ironic novel in English. If not it comes close and is possibly his best novel Lord Jim and Nostromo may be better. The twisted irony of the plot for all the destruction nothing really changes is first rate in the writing but it does not translate too well in this film version. Watch the film for Hitchcock's touches and his directing of Homolka Sylvia Sydney and the rest. But read the novel by Conrad for the real treat.".

The latter is also henpecked by his gawky daughter played by an unrecognisable Martita Hunt not in Ms Havisham mode.Stevie the heartbreakingly delightful brother is carrying the bomb to the Lord Mayor's show while every device a crowd offers holds him up and builds the tension.The scene where Winnie stabs Verloc Oscar Homolka is a triumph of understatement  it is banal evil a struggle over the dinner table  Winnie stabs Verloc almost in one motion without effort and without a clear purpose.  Typically having disposed of the villain a trick leaves her free the bomber strikes before the police can find Verloc's body. Hitchcock shies away from Conrad's bleak ending where Winnie is tricked out of the money and throws herself off a channel ferry. That would not be Hitch's style and this film is very much about style.".

The latter is also henpecked by his gawky daughter played by an unrecognisable Martita Hunt not in Ms Havisham mode.Stevie the heartbreakingly delightful brother is carrying the bomb to the Lord Mayor's show while every device a crowd offers holds him up and builds the tension.The scene where Winnie stabs Verloc Oscar Homolka is a triumph of understatement  it is banal evil a struggle over the dinner table  Winnie stabs Verloc almost in one motion without effort and without a clear purpose.  Typically having disposed of the villain a trick leaves her free the bomber strikes before the police can find Verloc's body. Hitchcock shies away from Conrad's bleak ending where Winnie is tricked out of the money and throws herself off a channel ferry. That would not be Hitch's style and this film is very much about style.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sabotage Based on Joseph Conrad's 1907 novel  The Secret Agent the story concerns Detective Sergeant Ted Spenser  John Lodger who is disguised as a greengrocer in order to uncover the details of a plot to destroy London. Involved in the plot are a band of German and British spies who use a movie theatre and a pet shop as a ' front' to cover their activities. The owner of the theatre Mr. Verloc  Oscar Homolka is involved in the plot but his young wife  Sylvia Sidney and her younger brother Stevie  Desmond Tester are ignorant of it. Soon feeling that something is up and under pressure from his coconspirators Verloc sends Stevie to deliver something for him only the young boy doesn't know he's delivering a timebomb.There are many standout scenes in this film. The first scene that comes to my mind is in the beginning of the film where London has just gone to total darkness. Several quick views of the power plants eventually lead us to the workmen who discover sand in the works.  Sabotage! cries one.  Who did it? The audience is given the answer immediately as the face of Verloc crisscrossed with the shadows emerges to fill the screen. Classic Hitchcock! The second scene which stands out to me is the entire sequence involving Stevie and his errand. In these scenes Stevie is completely at the mercy of others time and the saboteurs plot. For example the suspense Hitchcock builds on the bus with the conductor who ironically warns Stevie  Don't set fire to me or the other passengers. The last is the entire sequence in which Mrs. Verloc finds out what has just happened. This includes the Disney cartoon  Who killed Cock Robin? and later the scene where Verloc confesses to his wife his part in the sabotage  he does this against the background of the model boat which she and her brother had made and the later final dinner scene where not a word is spoken. This last part is so carefully arranged and so personal between the two they are right in each others faces silent.Sabotage is really quite simply a film rich in complexities of its moral ambiguities. Hitchcock examines really our thin veneer of security the potential we have to sabotage our own lives and the lives of others. For example the buying and selling of one?s own soul using the disguise or ?cover? of a cinema or as a greengrocer. In the end our own detective hero of the film faces his own moral dilemma for his own recognition of his duty has begun to crumble.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the midtolate 1930s Alfred Hitchcock held a unique position for a director. Since the successes of The Man Who Knew Too Much and The 39 Steps his destiny as a suspense filmmaker had been revealed not only to himself but also to his bosses at Gaumont. He was now only assigned material suitable to his area of expertise and given a considerable amount of freedom to play around with the form. At the tail end of his British period at a time when standard cinematic technique and narrative convention were well established Hitchcock was effectively a researcher of the kind that hadn't really been seen since the days of Griffith.Sabotage is adapted from the Joseph Conrad novel Secret Agent and it's worth taking a peek at a synopsis of the book to see the differences in the movie version two of which are very significant. Firstly the novel is a kind of antiheroic piece told largely from the pointofview of the villainous Verloc. You couldn't have that in cinema in the 30s so Verloc's opponents are beefed up into morally sound protagonists. However it is still revealed from the outset that Verloc is the culprit and we the audience are always kept aware of his doings even when the heroes are not. Dispensing with the Agatha Christie form of whodunit is essential to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense building. Revealing the identity and intentions of a killer keeps the audience constantly wondering when and how he will strike again.The other important difference between the novel and film is that Conrad states quite explicitly that Verloc and co. are anarchists delving quite deeply into their ideology as well as implying that they are Russians. Hitchcock's picture however makes no mention of the politics or nationality of the villains. They are simply generic foreign terrorists existing to make the plot work. Imagine how much weaker this picture would be if we were asked to think about Verloc's motives. He has thick eyebrows a sinister accent and he puts bombs on buses. What more do you need? On a purely formalist level Hitchcock's method is becoming increasingly streamlined. This is perhaps the earliest of his pictures which really feels like it was planned shot by shot before a single camera rolled. Of particular note is Hitch's staging of drama through reaction shots rather than expository dialogue. For example Oskar Homolka's reaction to Stevie talking about gangsters or pair of closeups after John Loder is pulled through the air vent that tells us one of the gang members has recognised him. There are a few pointless technical touches such as Homolka's vision of London in the fish tank glass or Stevie's face popping up among the crowd of boys but these are not as distracting as they could be in Hitch's earliest pictures.Hitchcock rarely gave his actors any coaching and relied upon a good professional cast to deliver the goods. In Sylvia Sydney and Oskar Homolka he has two of the best leads he had worked with so far and their restrained naturalistic performances make their climactic scene together incredibly effective. The supporting cast are not bad either although as usual with Hitchcock the comedy characters are the real standouts. Littleknown stage veteran William Dewhurst who plays the professor is a joy to watch and it almost looks as if his scenes are about to turn into Monty Python sketches.Much as I detest the phrase experimental film this was truly an experimental era for Hitchcock or at least one in which his pictures were going through a process of natural selection. He realised afterwards he had made a huge mistake in one aspect of the main suspense sequence on the bus  I won't reveal it here as it's a major spoiler  and would ensure he never repeated the error. In spite of what was for him an embarrassing flaw Sabotage is a very enjoyable and effective thriller not among the greatest of his British period but certainly worth watching.".

Sabotage is a testimony to Hitchcock's brilliance way back in the 1930s it showed the promise of a director who would go on to make the classics Marnie North by Northwest and of course Psycho.The beginning of the film didn't quite work to my liking I felt Hitchcock went a bit far with the narrative essentially spelling out details with unnecessary dialogue. 'What happened? Who did it? Let's show the villain!' Not necessary with the Hitchster's visuals. As the film progressed however this minor complaint found itself in isolation as the narrationdialogue improved and the Hitchcockian craftsmanship charmed me.There's something about directors like Hitchcock Welles Schafner and Leone in their ability to show an image that's been used in countless other films and keep it fresh. Whether or not it's new is not an issue it's all about the underlying technique that still keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. For example we've all seen the moment in a film when one of the innocents is unknowingly describing the hero to the film's villain whose usually occupied with some mundane activity we get that moment of realization in the villain's eye as he glances up. I see the move coming a mile away but I still find myself spellbound as Hitchcock delivers.Indirect SPOILER  The moment in Sabotage that absolutely won me over came at the film's climax when a child is placed in danger. My moviegoer instinct influenced by modern Hollywood trends told me 'Nothing will happen. There'll be some cheesy illlogical and extremely improbable rescue.' Then moments later I remembered 'Wait this is Hitchcock . . . the kid really is in danger' and I was on the edge of my seat as the appointed detonation time approached. The Master of Suspense delivered both a satisfying conclusion and setup and from that point on the rest of the film was delight after delight as Mrs. Verloc tapped into her dark side upon realizing the truth behind the bomb and as the web of deception comes full circle and consumes all involved. I adore the scene where her and Mrs. Verloc are at the table and her body language telegraphs the thoughts passing through her mind then Verloc simple walks around the table and how she abruptly snatches up the knife. Not much dialogue and none is really needed. End SPOILER.Sabotage pales next to the beallendall suspense film Psycho however Sabotage is a nice little precursor of what would come.".

	schema:headline " The film with the infamous 'bomb on bus' scene";
	schema:reviewBody "Sabotage clearly isn't Hitchcock's finest hour but even though this is a 'lesser' Hitchcock film the director still manages to inject the film with many of his trademarks that would go on to make classics out of films such as Psycho and North by Northwest. Hitchcock makes centrepieces out of several scenes the best of which include a crossfade with an aquarium and a London street the striking opening sequence that sees London go dark of course the infamous scene on a bus  and my personal favourite and the crux of the film  the climatic scene that sees saboteur Karl Verloc played to perfection by Oskar Homolka try to pass the blame for his actions on to the Scotland Yard inspective who rumbled him. The plot sees cinema owner the aforementioned Karl Verloc get himself involved with terrorists. He manages the cinema along with his wife and her brother and neither of them knows what's going on. The only third party who does know is Sgt. Ted Spencer the Scotland Yard inspector employed to work a vegetable stall next door as a cover to investigate Mr Verloc.This film is most famous for the sequence that sees young Desmond Tester carry a bomb onto a packed London bus. Audiences at the time were outraged by the climax to this scene but I was impressed with it. By having the story run the way it should Hitchcock showed early on the sort of flair that would ensure Psycho a place on 'best film' lists forty five years after its release. Hitchcock shows a willingness to take a risk and while it may not have done him much good at the time  it's that sort of mentality that made him one of cinema's greats. As you'd expect Hitchcock makes best use of the latest cinema techniques available at the time but also harks back to the silent classics with several shots made to look like storyboards. It's obvious why Joseph Conrad's novel appealed to the great director as the story itself is packed with suspense and Hitchcock always makes the best of it. The build up to the finale of the bus scene is beautifully serene yet so daunting at the same time. On the whole Sabotage represents a good example of early Hitchcock and comes highly recommended to his many fans.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sabotage clearly isn't Hitchcock's finest hour but even though this is a 'lesser' Hitchcock film the director still manages to inject the film with many of his trademarks that would go on to make classics out of films such as Psycho and North by Northwest. Hitchcock makes centrepieces out of several scenes the best of which include a crossfade with an aquarium and a London street the striking opening sequence that sees London go dark of course the infamous scene on a bus  and my personal favourite and the crux of the film  the climatic scene that sees saboteur Karl Verloc played to perfection by Oskar Homolka try to pass the blame for his actions on to the Scotland Yard inspective who rumbled him. The plot sees cinema owner the aforementioned Karl Verloc get himself involved with terrorists. He manages the cinema along with his wife and her brother and neither of them knows what's going on.

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Alfred Hitchcock's early British films is a treat for this viewer particularly in seeing the director's experimentation with themes that will become better known in his more famous American movies. Sabotage becomes an intriguing psychological drama even after the early revelation of the parts his key characters play in the story.Particularly vile is Karl Anton Verloc Oscar Homolka a terrorist conspiring to plant bombs in association with an underground cadre. He uses a London cinema house as a front for his activities while his antagonist a Scotland Yard detective named Spencer John Loder attempts to get enough evidence to expose him. Verloc is married to an American woman Sylvia Sidney who is unaware of his activities.With tense precision Hitchcock visually reinforces the timing of Verloc's next bombing even though the actual target is never mentioned by name. To carry out his mission he enlists the services of his wife's young brother Stevie. As Stevie gets sidetracked by the distractions that would affect any teenager he becomes the victim of Verloc's plot when the bomb detonates destroying a London bus.Mrs. Verloc's consolation comes in the form of revenge. The moment of retribution takes form almost immediately after she catches herself laughing at scenes of a Disney cartoon playing in the cinema  Who killed Cock Robin? indeed. In classic Hitchcock style the director makes use of quick cuts to the saboteur the wife serving dinner plates of food and of course a knife. Needless to say the knife finds it's mark and with it a cold satisfaction for the audience.As in Hitchcock's first talking film 1929's Blackmail the director uses deft sleight of hand to shift blame for Verloc's death to a surrogate. In the earlier film a case could be made that the female killer was acting in self defense. Here the event was achieved with spontaneous calculation. In both movies the female lead was just on the edge of making a confession when abrupt dismissal by the authorities led them to a different conclusion about the murders.The film left me curious about a couple of things the main one being how audiences of the time reacted to the death of an innocent teenager. It seems to me that this would have been a particularly controversial subject for the time. On a very different note I was left wondering whether the appearance of a rather large billboard directly behind the bombed bus was intentional or not it was an ad for Coca Cola.Though it's been stated otherwise by other reviewers on this site the movie does have it's light moment even if only one the Disney sequence notwithstanding. In an early scene at the pet shop an old biddy tries to return a canary that doesn't sing. The shop owner has no trouble getting the bird to warble implying that maybe it's the lady's fault. Strange though that the shop would also have chickens and a rooster!".

This is not a movie the director could have made in Hollywoodthe Hayes office would never have allowed it. What with the killing of a central character an innocent kid plus an unpunished murder by another central character there's no way the film could have originated stateside. Nonetheless it's one of Hitch's most interesting since it raises a number of complex moral issues attaching to both guilt and innocence. Most saliently should Mrs. Verloc Sydney be allowed to walk away from killing her husband unpunished and if so why?Also there's the issue of terrorism not dealt with by many films of the time but which seems very topical in our own day. Apparently the terrorist killing of the boy Tester has been a controversial part of the film over the years since it's so wrenching and goes against unwritten moviemaking norms. Nonetheless I think it's an important part of the story since it calls attention to the death of innocents caused by terrorist acts whether the bombs are planted or come from the sky. I'm glad Hitch had the gumption to include it.Anyway it's not a movie to see if you're depressed. The lighting is dark the mood somber with a doleful Sydney a sourfaced Homolka and a conflicted Loder. Still it's good to see so many Londoners going to the movies in those days even if they do want their money back. In my view it's one of Hitch's most daring movies British or American.".

Sylvia Sidney is wonderful in this  carrying herself with dignity and confidence in a way seldom seen in Hitchcock's women she was also excellent in Lang's The Fury made around the same time. Joseph Conrad's novel Secret Agent on which this film is based is now on my reading list.

	schema:reviewBody "Joseph Conrad's novella The Secret Agent served as the basis of Alfred Hitchcock's Sabotage during his British period. Since Mr. Hitchcock had already directed another English film Secret Agent the title was changed to Sabotage not to be confused with Saboteur which the director made in America in 1942 which is not a remake. The achievement of this film is tremendous even when the viewer knows from the start who the evil character is. Mr. Hitchcock pulled it off in surprising and simple ways that paid off handsomely in this thriller that in spite of having been made more than 74 years ago still merits a view by fans of the director. Mr. Hitchcock knew how to keep the suspense as he proved here. The viewer is kept at the edge of his seat as one watches Stevie the young boy going on to deliver the bomb that unknown to him his brotherinlaw thought would surely go to its intended target. Because of the parade and not being able to cross the street by the police barricade he has no other way to get to Picadilly by taking the bus as time gets closer to the deadline of 1.45pm.The other fantastic sequence involves the killing of Verloc. It is done without any sound practically yet the impact it creates in our minds is nothing short of shocking because basically Sylvia Verloc cannot believe the monster she has married could be the one responsible for the death of her own brother. The ironic twist at the end comes unexpectedly at the end without even a hint of what is going to happen to the Bijou when all the evil doer is trapped inside the apartment trying to retrieve the bird cages.Sylvia Sidney made a wonderful Mrs. Verloc. She is not the typical blond the director favored but she brought a great presence to the film. Oskar Homolka underplayed his Verloc to an amazing effect. He is menacing without doing much which goes to show what good actor he was. John Loder is seen as Ted the undercover agent assigned to watch what was going on at the theater next door. Diamond Tester added a touch of innocence to the action we all know he is a good kid who did not deserve his tragic end.Sabotage is vintage Hitchcock that must be seen by serious fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Judwaa directed by Salman Khan was released on Feb 13 1997. I was there in India at that time. The film went on to do well at the boxoffice reportedly bringing in 2.1 crores rupees per territory.  In many ways Judwaa gave Salman a second shot at super stardom.  Before Judwaa there was Hum Aapke Hain Koun but that did more for Madhuri Dixit then Salman Khan. Before Judwaa Salman had done a number of films that failed miserably at the box office and cast a shadow over his career but Judwaa changed all that.Judwaa is Salman Khan's first film in which he has done two roles. He is also the first among his contemporaries Amir and Shah Rukh.  The plot is quiet simple. Two twin borthers separated at birth reunite after a chain of hillarious events. Both the twins can feel one another.Salman has shown considerable flair for comedy in this film.  The credit must also go to the director David Dhawan. Incidently Mr. Dhawan has been after Salman to do a film for him. The two later collaborated on another super hit Biwi No1.The music for Judwaa is by Anu Malik. The style and the numbers definitely suit Salman's personality.  The two heroines are simply gorgeous to look at but Rambha could use a  few acting lessons.Judwaa is fun film to watch though the plot is very similiar to a Jackie Chan movie Twin Brothers and loosely adopted from the telgu hit Hello Brother starring Nagarjuna. This movie will be most enjoyable to Salman Khan Fan.".

Case in point Karisma and Salman both could possible act together in for years and years to come. I would to see the longevity of these two they work really well together. Karisma should come back to the screen in 24 yrs. I am glad that she had the maturity to get married at the age she did smart move. Karisma's acting is very much based on the love of the craft...I remember the Karisma poster I had when Prem Quadi came out. I think she was the first newcomer who worked with a no name and did not use industry connections. Some of the newer girls look older...Which goes to show you that age is just a number. Karisma could easily play a 16yr old again. Karisma has singlehandedly revolutionized Indian Cinema. Now I know why all my friends and I liked her back then...when Indian cinema was not Bollywood. I cannot believe the terms Lollywood Tollywood Kollywood and the like. I do not see British Spanish Italian Finnish filmmakers comparing the too. There is no comparison.

Among the ladies both Rambha and Karishma do a good job of showing off their anatomies in song picturisations. The music is catchy and blends in perfectly with the storyline. Anupam Kher and Satish Shah as the silly but cute cops are hilarious. Judwaa on the whole is basically a light hearted comedy featuring actors who are proved comedians.

Satish Shah and Anupam Kher overact their comedy sometimes making those scenes a little too slapstick and repetitive for my liking. The songs are also very catchy especially Anu Malik's baritone in Unchi Hai Building or Tan Tana Tan. I would recommend it to someone who just wants a movie to chill out for a one time watch. Rent it out on DVD if you can no need buy it because I feel you will not feel like watching this a second time. All in all I would rate this 610.".

Nice movie for Salman lovers though since there is doubledose of him. Sadly another likable movie that is not a Bollywood original. But I would surely watch Judwaa for its funny scenes. And oh ya how could I forget. If you want to hear Anu Malik's funny voice singing some really funny lyrics this is the movie  just listen to Oonchi Hain Building Lift Teri Band Hai D.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film in 1972 when it came out and I just saw it again on cable. I am amazed at how prescient this film was. Remember this was before Jerry Brown the real life politician most people will think of as a counterpart to Redford's character had not yet run for governor and was still unknown outside of California. Nixon was still in office and was about to be reelected by a landslide. Abortion was still illegal in all 50 states and Roe v. Wade had not yet been decided. The term sound bite had not yet been coined. Spin was something a washing machine did.Redford plays an idealistic young storefront lawyer who is persuaded to run for the Senate as a Democrat against a Republican incumbent running for his fourth term. He feels free to speak his mind because he knows he hasn't a chance of winning. His freshness and honesty win over a lot of people favorable to his politics and suddenly the gap closes. Now he has a chance of winning but to do so he has to win over the undecided voters in the middle of the political spectrum. Sound familiar? I'm writing this nine days before the BushKerry election and no one knows who will win. Guess what happens? Suddenly he's not so fresh and honest anymore. And by the time he finally has a televised debate with the incumbent he has mastered the art of the nonanswer answer that is responding to a reporter's question by making a vague statement of his own without ever answering the question.Fast forward to 2004. The spin doctors now run the show. This film was intended as satire and as a warning. Regrettably it has become a prediction. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Ritchie seems to have this thing for competition  whether downhill racing body building water skiing or as here politics. This isn't my favorite human motive besting other people so this one comes as a rather pleasant surprise laden as it is with more social and political content than the with the details of the quest. I mean  Redford doesn't even want the office!The Candidate has the appearance of a madeforTV movie. The credits are presented simply as in a TV movies. There is no underscore but the music that we hear consists of marches with lots of drums and sometimes one or two instruments hitting clinkers as they would on a bandstand behind a speaker.The photography is highly colored and flat as in a TV movie. Everybody seems to be dressed in suits or riding costumes. They look overly made up freshly preened and pruned. They drive big new American cars and live in splendidly arid modern homes. In short they appear to lead the kind of lives to which naive screenwriters aspire.That out of the way this is a pretty brave movie. It's a story of an innocent and blunt lawyer who become progressively corrupted during the campaign as victory seems more nearly in his grasp and the grasp of his managers. They 86 his sideburns and give him a haircut and put him in expensive suits. Girls love him because he displays such well such Robert Redfordness. One guy belts him in the mouth at a rally and I can understand why. All men as handsome as Robert Redford should be illegal.But he does a decent job in his minimal way. His forte lies in little moves as when he cocks his head and says quizzically Eh? Everybody else is quite good too though his wife is mostly decorative. Peter Boyle is fine and Allan Garfinkle is always believable as a cynical scuzz. You have to admire the way the script does not spare Redford's character. He may be an idealist at first. What does he think of abortion? I'm for it. How about property taxes. I don't know. By the end of the movie he's learned fluent politicospeak. How's he feel about busing? You can't solve the problems of this country with a bus. Right. He knows that he's selling himself out but he wants to WIN. As the campaign gets into high gear he's late for a meeting with a labor leader a grizzled Kenneth Toby given to smoking pinched little cigarettes. Everybody in the room is wondering where Redford is and how he can treat an important man like Toby with such disrespect. And where is he? We see the door to a hotel room open and there emerges a girl so gorgeous that if she were an escort instead of a groupie she'd be extremely expensive. A few seconds later Redford comes out buttoning his jacket.Nothing much is made of this incident. Boyle watches this parade in the hallway staring after the girl but nobody says anything and the scene lasts for only a few seconds. And here is where Ritchie and the writers earn my respect. Think of how easily this very effective scene could have been demolished. Boyle stopping the groupie and demanding to know what's been going on. Boyle admonishing Redford for cheating on his wife  If this ever gets out our goose is cooked! Redford protesting that his private life is his own business. But none of this happens. Not in this scene or in any of the others in which a piece of character is revealed. Ritchie trusts in the perspicacity of the viewer. He shows us because he doesn't have to tell us. He figures we're smart enough to pick up this clues by ourselves. Thank you Mister Ritchie.We should be grateful to the writer as well and to Redford's improvisational talents when alone in a car's rear seat half crazed he mangles the stump speech he's given a thousand times and comes up with a hilarious parody The basic indifference that made this country great. Also admirable is that the movie deals with specific issues  abortion busing unemployment fire hazard health concerns  and Redford is the Democratic candidate while Don Porter is the Republican candidate imagine actually NAMING the political parties and risking losing half the audience.Porter comes across like an actor an old ham of an actor which suits the part. He's smooth and wily at seducing the public a kind of Don Juan of the political arena. Ritchie has taken some real chances here. Porter comes up with something like Oh sure when I was a kid we were all poor too. Why some of us didn't even have our own SOCIAL WORKER. It took guts to make this movie. And talent to make it so well.".

But suddenly the public realizes that some fresh younger blood with an idealistic eye might be what they truly want rather than another in a long succession of terms by the same old huckster. Melvyn Douglas also stars as Redford's father. Even though this film is almost 30 years old the Oscarwinning screenplay by Jeremy Larner shows just how timeless the same old issues the candidate has to decide where he stands upon abortion the environment health care actually are. The script really is eyeopening because it underlines very well the point that even if say Jesus Christ were to run for office today what He would say is not as important as how and when He'd say it. Directed by Michael Ritchie Smile The Bad News Bears SemiTough one of the few American directors who has been able to successfully show the black humor of the strange fetid underbelly of competition in this society.

	schema:reviewBody "Redford plays Bill McKay a crusading lawyer who happens to be the son of a former governor of California a fact he plays down. When incumbent Republican Crocker Jarmon Don Porter is running for his umpteenth term in the senate kingmaker Marvin Lucas Peter Boyle decides to tap Bill as a wild dark horse candidate. While young McKay is initially suspicious and unwilling Lucas tells him he can do whatever he likes and say whatever he likes on the campaign trail because no one expects him to win. With that freedom in mind McKay sets off to run a very different style of campaign.The acting here is all top notch. Redford a natural for the cameras manages to make McKay fairly awkward and uncomfortable in the early going but as he warms to being what a candidate is all about he takes to the campaign trail amazingly well. Boyle is also excellent as the kind of old bastard it always takes to win one of these races the political insider every race needs to smooth over the opposition within the party and crucify those without. Porter is also good as Jarmon showing a stiff wooden conservative incumbent who must have seemed hopelessly out of date in 1972  especially considering his dashing youthful opposition  but who also sounds oddly like any politician in office today with his talk of loving America and supporting business.The movie makes a very keen point about what people have to do to get elected and we see a slow whittling of McKay's priorities as he must sacrifice his principles one by one in order to get elected. By the end of the campaign the freshfaced honest young man we were introduced to at the start is gone replaced by a slick image who is all things to all people. To be fair McKay fights this process but the movie makes a strong point that simply this is what is required in order to win. The end note  McKay asking Lucas What do we do now? is both telling and chilling that even thirty years ago there was such distrust and distaste for politics and what it did to people and this was a year before Watergate. The Candidate still plays well despite some dated material and the lessons it offers about politics and what it does to people still apply today. This is a film well worth your time investigating.".

	schema:reviewBody "If nothing counts then everything does.  Michael Connelly Some points...1. The Candidate stars Robert Redford as Bill McKay a young lawyer who is manipulated into running against the Democratic candidate of California by political election specialist Marvin Lucas 2. The film highlights how frontrunning politicians are often groomed by a team of handlers and election specialists. The end result is less a person and more some cookiecutter one man for all people fantasy image. historically youngvibrant presidents often follow oldseemingly wise presidents the public always bouncing from one extreme to the next forever dissatisfied3. The film charts how disillusioned those within the political sphere often become. McKay goes from an idealistic lawyer who fights in the public's interest to a man who spouts banal slogans and vapid sound bites.4. How to win an election have no clear political message. Stick to vague promises and appealing catchphrases. Promise change but specify nothing.5. The film highlights how inbred democratic politics has become. Everyone's father is in the business everyone's calling in favours scratching backs and providing a helping hand. 6. Studies show that not only do a disproportionate number of sons follow their fathers into politics but that those sons who lost or were separated from their fathers at an early age or view their politician fathers as failures often climb higher into power then their parents. There's some seriously warped psychological issues going on there.7. Those drawn to politics are often those worse suited to the job. Those idealistic few who join for noble purposes are soon crushed by the system.8. Politicians automatons cult like drones who adopt the speech patterns of those they admire and surround themselves with. Democracy forever dependent on voter gullibility.9. After McKay wins the election at the end of the film he turns to his handlers and says What do we do now? What indeed. If the process of winning an election is so difficult so time consuming one imagines that staying in power will become a similarly all consuming and obsessive task. The politician cares not about bettering society but about doing what is necessary to stay in power.10. Most social changes benefits progress etc occur despite politicianspolitics not because of it.11. Politics in the television age image driven a circus act empty spectacle pure entertainment voters asked to choose a leader like they choose a detergent brand.12. McKay's political colours yellow green deliberately revoke the reds whites and blues of Americana. Only at the end when he wins and is fully corrupted does he succumb his car now draped in reds whites and blues.13. Films like this were common in the 70s many evoking the paranoia of the time period The Parallax View Three Days of the Condor Z All The President's Men The Manchurian Candidate etc.14. French sociologist Jacques Ellul argued in his book Propaganda that it matters little what propagandists stand for or what their ends are Liberal Conservative Republican Democrat etc because they are all taking part in an exercise that is fundamentally dehumanizing and antidemocratic. McKay may be a handsome sympathetic icon of liberalism and virtue but ultimately this isn't important. McKay and what he stands for will inevitably be overcome by the political machine he inhabits. He's no different from his opponent.15. Ellul discussed this idea further in The Technological Society. Here he argues that we are now so obsessed with technology and efficiency  with that one very best way to achieve a predetermined goal  that we have lost sight of our actions and in a fundamental way of what it means to be human. This idea is apparent throughout the film the political campaign run by a hive of specialised robot consultants and a candidate who misplaces some of his humanness once he becomes obsessed with getting his numbers to move in the right direction. Poll numbers softmoney loopholes attack ads phone ratings...this is politics meets Game Theory. 16 The religion of the future the cult of control of number worship of data mining of information gathering. Theory security equals more data. Reality Chaos.810  Excellent. The problem with these films though is that we as a modern audience are so aware of the problems are so cynical towards politics anyway that these films all amount to wasted preaching. Perhaps the realisation is that it is arrogant to assume that one man one bill passed by congress has the effect to instigate meaningful change especially now that we live in a world where the big social changes seem to occur irrationally often by accident a world where a woman like Rosa Parks sitting in the back of a bus ends racial segregation?. One is then forced to make an almost Sartrean leap. If nothing counts then why enter politics? Which leads to if nothing counts then everything does. Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Candidate is very insightful very conscientious and very accurate in exploring the trials tribulations and developments in transforming a nihilistic underdog into a popular contending candidate for the California Senate. It is a good provocative and even satiric look at the ups and downs of the political landscape as well as its many constraints with political advisers not interested in the candidate's candidness but rather sealing an election and this is very fascinatingly and simply laid out in a film that goes the full monty in exploring the American political landscape this is generally a behindthescenes development of the political process from the frequent campaign rallies to the luncheons and parades to the advantage of incumbency to dirty campaign tricks to critical debates and finally to the anxiety tension and exasperation of the election. Robert Redford is the character study playing an aspiring yet hardly hopeful son of a former California governor dashing and articulate candidate for California Senate Bill McKay for the Democratic party. His challenger is incumbent Senator Crocker Jarmon who seems to be the antithesis of all of the charisma articulation and humbleness that is McKay a rather arrogant prudent and unappealing candidate regardless of whether you share his beliefs. I have to wonder is the film taking jabs at the Republican party claiming it is apathetic selfserving and shadowy while in contrast the Democratic party cares passionately about the people contains darling appeal and considers a better way for the people rather than simply winning an election. Perhaps I am finding ways to detract from some clear and distinguished differences between McKay and Jarmon because of their parties in the film and perhaps this is because I believe BOTH parties stand for the people regardless of my political allegiances whatever just a curious observation. Robert Redford plays McKay very well and earnestly really bringing this vivacious and whimsical character to life and shining on the campaign trail. The screenplay is absolutely brilliant taking every idea about politics and ingeniously infusing it throughout the many events of the film a very constructive and admirable endeavor indeed. The music is very patriotic sentimental and portentous really defining the American political spirit and really pounding on a theme of greatness through victory. This is an extremely well crafted well scripted well acted well directed and well received albeit very predictable and incisive film exploring the political landscape as verily as I have ever seen a film endeavor in. It's simple entertaining and contains some solid education about the shaping of a political candidate through a hostile volatile and demanding political campaign The Candidate is a real winner. 12 out of ".

I think I would have really liked this movie in 1972 I certainly loved it a few years later when I saw it for the first time but now it seems like an enduring classic. It is shot like a campaign is run  you feel the crushing emptiness of a political campaign and Redford's frustration with being unable to raise actual issues is palpable. He is a contender mainly because of his looks and family ties not because of his beliefs. He has to boil them down to sound bites not a term in 1972 I don't think and then give some of them up altogether all in order to win. The 'voters' don't come off too well either  they seem like either groupies young girls or older country club ladies or disaffected losers. This should be shown in every 8th grade civics class!".

	schema:headline " A Scathing Commentary";
	schema:reviewBody "Only recently does it seem like the political world has been soiled by entertainment media. HBO's Veep created by the satirically minded Armando Iannucci is a brutal comedy series that details the day to day life of the vice president. Don't expect to see an allAmerican woman pining for a better America because you get a narcissist hungry for power. Netflix's House of Cards makes politics seem as dirty as the crime world with elected officials offing enemies left and right utilizing corruption for the sake of unbridled authority.In days past there was something mystical about a candidate  the one we loved not the Nixon of the race seemed to be a sort of god who could do no wrong. Look at JFK FDR they were far from perfect but their image their reputation turned them into unspeakably untouchable icons. But it seems postVietnam postWatergate America has turned into a hotbed of negativity. We don't trust our sacred politicians like we used to. And so The Candidate is more relevant than ever. In 1972 the U.S. was just starting to turn into a bunch of pessimists. But now we regard many of our elected officials in the same way we do the villain of a political thriller evil devilishly evil. But smart. The Candidate is part black comedy part political drama all stitched together by an endlessly scathing screenplay and a finely tuned performance from Robert Redford. It isn't so much an emotional film as it is a witty commentary regarding the election process and how most candidates go from freshly idealistic to power hungry after a mere few months of campaigning. The film doesn't tap into our fears in the same way All the President's Men did or how Three Days of the Condor told us not to trust anyone sitting in office. Rather it serves as a thoughtprovoker that makes us wonder if the smiles governmental hopefuls put on display are actually genuine. It's a bleak bleak movie not so much because it is starkly negative but because it prefers to think that getting elected is a popularity contest not a case of may the best man win. Redford plays Bill McKay a 30ish attorney who on a whim decides to run for Senate. Incumbent Crocker Jarmon Don Porter is slated to win  McKay you see has been approached by political specialist Marvin Lucas Peter Boyle who only wants McKay to act as a Democratic figure not as serious competition. Jarmon after all cannot run unopposed. McKay knows he has little by way of chance but knowing he has the opportunity to spread his ideals around the state does everything he can to potentially find success. And as the son of the former governor Melvyn Douglas with not to mention good looks that have captured much of the female vote his possibilities may be stronger than Lucas could have ever imagined. Problem is if McKay really wants to win he'll have to in some ways trade many of his morals in favor of popularity.The Candidate is filmed as if it were a documentary following McKay around until his positive nature completely breaks down and sardonic ickiness takes over. As the film begins he is a charismatic intellect who has a way with words he is a lawyer after all. But by the end he can hardly control himself from laughing attacks when faced with the bullsht of a television promotion. The more he campaigns the more he becomes disgusted with the idea of politics  the officials are snakes who know how to manipulate the public. Morals he finds out are of little importance to his peers. Sounding good looking good speaking well being agreeable going against the grain of the nowhated person he's trying to rob the job of  those are the things that matter. You can forget about making the country a better place.Larner's Academy Award winning screenplay hits all the right notes  not mean but wicked funny but not overtly so. It isn't a comedy as much as it is a drama that realizes how ridiculous campaigning is and it cackles along with McKay's increasing concerns. There is a great little scene that finds McKay in the back of a limo reciting old lines from previous speeches. But after each sound bite he makes a sound of disgust whether it be a gag a cough or a scoff. The sequence is subtle yet it speaks volumes have we gotten to a point in our election process where a particular quote a particular fragment of a speech matters more than the overall goal of a candidate?The film also contains one of Redford's finest performances capturing his distinctly everyman appeal while heightening the sly humor he can easily project just by uttering a single line. He is the kind of actor that can deliver a line like We don't have sht in common and still remain likable he is the kind of actor that can look unfazed by the presence of a cameoing Natalie Wood and not seem like a complete jerk. In The Candidate we don't necessarily identify with him. Instead we jump onto his back as he maneuvers through the jangling dishonesty of the election process. Here is a movie more interested in saying something than showcasing how great its actors are how great its direction is. The Candidate doesn't move you it causes you to think. And as the race for the presidency continually heats up these days it is compelling viewing that has hardly aged in what it has to say.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting that The Candidate starts with a look at the attitudes of the political handlers because they're apparently the motive force in this film. They are in the film unscrupulous salesmen who are selling political services. Poor Bill McKay is the cynical son of an expolitician who thinks he's seen it all but gets suckered and seduced anyway.That's the disappointing thing about cynicism a lot of people knock it and try to eradicate it but as this film suggests frequently we're not cynical enough. Cynicism kills you while it protects you.I'm not a politician but what little I know about it unless McKay's handlers were hired by Crocker Jarmon they get paid to WIN not lose. If they WIN they get hired by someone else if they LOSE they don't. So it's in Marvin Lucas' best interests to WIN. When he tells McKay it's alright to lose he's lying.Since Marcus came to McKay and not the other way around is THAT realistic? then we have to view him as a sort of political guruforhire who spots potential latent ambitionvanityhubris and ability to pay presumably and sells the idea of candidacy to the potential candidate.Unless I missed something that's not the way it works but OK.This is a film that works on the idea that even the most idealistic will be corrupted by the machine remembering that ...the Abyss also looks into you.It's been said that no one who WANTS power should be CONSIDERED for power. Too bad it doesn't work that way.So here we have McKay the standard Thanks but no thanks idealist who is corrupted and suckered despite himself despite his cynicism. From being his own man if that's ever possible we see him start being handled by his new buddies and by his suddenly ambitious wife.I loved the scene when she says Ooh they cut your hair like it was their idea which it was and they were the decisionmaking parents which they were. It obviously pisses McKay off because she's so comfortable acknowledging that the handlers are making his decisions for him. She asks him to turn his head so she can see it but he doesn't do it like an angry child. He's looking at her as if she's trying to decide which roses will look best in the White House garden. As he's struggling with his own latent ambition he's also observing hers. He's lost control and struggling to get away from his father's influence he and his wife are now under the influences of both his advisers and their own life ambitions. Because really how long CAN McKay remain an idealistic storefront lawyer? Growth is inevitable. The alternatives are stagnation and decay.Interestingly besides creating a health clinic or planting some trees his before candidacy character doesn't have solutions for the BIG problems any more than anyone else does. Idealism yes solutions no.And that's the message that Melvyn Douglas gives us. It doesn't matter. Politics aren't here to save the world they're an element of it's destruction. We can slow the process down MAYBE but we can't stop it. Like the aging process you can stay in shape and eat well but you can't make yourself younger. The processes of the world technology power suburban sprawl etc. have agendas of their own and we can push them forward but we can't hold them back.While you're saving the trees they're killing the whales and when you turn to the whales they're cutting the trees. When you're saving THIS forest they're chopping down that one and raising the taxes starting wars creating pollution writing new laws limiting your rights and hitting you over the head with guns red tape inoculations and misinformation. All in your best interests. Progress will eventually kill us.So The Candidate isn't about political solutions it's about the seduction of Power. As McKay looks into Power Power looks into him. Will he turn into his father despite himself? Redford is great in this film bringing a lot of comedy to a role that greatly needed it. I've always loved that scene where he can't keep from laughing due to exhaustion while trying to express his Point Of View. In his best films he doesn't forget the comedy.This is the first time I've seen the film when I'm old enough 97 to realize that he does take a private timeout with that beguiling girl with the glasses.The Candidate is a great film but it isn't prescient. It's a statement of the eternal political process more or less the way it's always been. Spin existed before the term was coined they just called it something else like lying.In case you care my favorite parts of SpyGame were the parts in the present where Muir was outfoxing the foxes. When RR wants to be he's one of the best actors around. Funny and smart.OK and while I'm at it one of his bestdelivered lines ever was in 3 Days Of The Condor It's a great face...but it's never been to China.".

This scathing and realistic depiction of the US political scene however was much more rewarding allowing both Ritchie and Redford to shine in an excellent drama making use of a flyonthewall almost documentary technique to paint a convincing wartsandall picture of the machinery which it seems is necessary for the candidature of an aspiring US senator.Being from Britain of course some of the background and terminology used was slightly foreign but the film holds up really well on a universal basis particularly in its portrayal of what we'd now term behind the scenes spindoctors and the fronting of a political machine by a young goodlooking idealistic convictionpolitician against an oldstyle rightwing ultraconservative rival  the parallels between the BlairMajor UK election of 1997 and obviously 2008 ObamaMcCain US election while not exact are certainly palpable.I personally rate this as Redford's best ever acting display  he seems an absolute natural as the initially energetic moral campaigning but nohope candidate who learns the hard way about compromise political correctness and above all how the arcane machinery of politics USA actually works. Thus we see him on the stump in amusing voxpops with eccentric or bemused members of the public cleaning up his physical appearance and generalising his ideals for the sake of bland voterfriendly rhetoric and even falling victim to the temptations of the flesh to an obsessive female follower this last point concisely and effectively made without overdramatisation c.f. Gary Hart and of course Pres. Clinton himself  for sure Redford's McKay character did have sexual relations with this woman but lives to tell the tale.Tension is built up as election day looms and we see McKay starting to break down under the pressure as he resorts to gibberish enroute to a TV studio but by then his onside advertising campaign highlighting his goodlooks youthful vigour but playing down his more controversial leftofcentre views propels him to an unlikely win against his incumbent opponent and by the surprise ending just at the point of victory the director I think is telling us that the movie is less about the contest than the process itself. A similar ending device was used at the end of Downhill Racer but it works far better this time as you genuinely are intrigued by Redford's multidimensional character and wonder just what kind of senator he would have made. The absence of a sequel was definitely a missed opportunity here.A quick word about the ensemble acting  it's uniformly good and verite is reinforced with the appearances of a number of reallife personalities ranging all the way from pre CNNera TV commentators to Natalie Wood at a fundraiser although quite what an uncredited Groucho Marx is doing haranguing Redford in a toilet is anyone's guess.In closing then a brave uncompromising multilayered and above all entertaining insight into contemporary US politics of the early 70's. Note to self  must rewatch All The President's Men sometime soon...".

The absence of a sequel was definitely a missed opportunity here.A quick word about the ensemble acting  it's uniformly good and verite is reinforced with the appearances of a number of reallife personalities ranging all the way from pre CNNera TV commentators to Natalie Wood at a fundraiser although quite what an uncredited Groucho Marx is doing haranguing Redford in a toilet is anyone's guess.In closing then a brave uncompromising multilayered and above all entertaining insight into contemporary US politics of the early 70's. Note to self  must rewatch All The President's Men sometime soon...";

	schema:headline " Bill McKay a WASP pezzonovante ...";
	schema:reviewBody "For the nonexperts pezzonovante is a direct reference to the Sicilian word used in The Godfather to describe a senator governor or any upstarts or ambitious newcomer on the political field basically what Vito Corleone wanted for his son MichaelI chose this title because in 1973 the two Oscars for Best Screenplay went to The Godfather and The Candidate. Although they play in different leagues both screenplays bear interesting similarities through the implicit statements they make about the limits of the American Dream and the ideals that supposedly forged it. Indeed no matter how charismatic they are there's something rotten in a country that allows such figures as Michael Corleone and Bill McKay to succeed.My judgment might be severe but it's a credit to Robert Redford's extraordinary performance. Sometimes we're put in the electors' shoes and see him like a handsome and idealistic patriot eager to raise the voice of American social outcasts and sometimes we remember as parts of the sideshow that these are the very reasons he was picked by his friend Marvin Lucas Peter Boyle to represent the Democrat party despite his blatant lack of experience. And what's the catch for McKay? The film reveals its cynical and interesting premise when Boyle writes in a matchbox his only guarantee you will lose. The point of his candidature is not to undermine a Democrat potential leader's career and yet provide a realistic opponent to the Republican the much popular Crocker Jarmon. The certitude of the defeat is compensated by a symbolical victory McKay has all freedom to spread his values share his vision and gain some publicity. Seems like a winwin situation.McKay accepts not without reluctance and more driven by the surrounding enthusiasm starting with his wife who enjoys her new 'first lady' etiquette. But there's something we know about the American political machine once you put your foot in there's no way getting back. And the irony with McKay is that his political carelessness and lack of true ambitious will catch the eyes and ears of Democrats by inspiring a more genuine and less generic form of political expression precisely what the public needed. The Candidate brilliantly points out the effect of good merchandising in politics. Like a product McKay has the looks the message  and also the brand.The name is in fact the film's subplot involving McKay's father a notso popular veteran politician played by Melvyn Douglas. The reporters notice that the father never endorses his son's candidature but McKay pretends it's a way to assess his independence. However after a severe drop in polls that would have foreshadowed a total humiliation McKay wins a debate against Jarmon at the last minute thanks to a genuine reaction rejecting the hypocritical aspect of a confrontation that dodged the real issues. Jarmon is upset McKay wins then McKay Sr. blesses him with the greatest compliment he could ever give him son you're a politician.Jeremy Larner who was a speech writer for the Democrat Eugene McCarthy and then can be trusted in terms of accuracy wrote the script. It isn't just a fictionalization of a true story but a gutsy political pamphlet that hasn't lost its relevance. And if we don't remember McCarthy we do remember the former President who hadn't done much for the country yet compensated his lack of accomplishment thanks to his father's aura and used Christian idiosyncrasies to please the crowds. Bush Jr. was no less a puppet than McKay but he won and the pages he wrote might not be regarded as the greatest chapter of American history.And since he was elected I guess The Candidate failed as a warning and this is why I blame the film for not having been more 'thoughtprovoking' and 'entertaining'. The script was great the performance of Redford as a man torn between his sincere ideals and his conviction that he's a fraud get thrillingly palpable as the film progresses. Peter Boyle Michael Lerner and Allen Garfield are absolutely scenestealing as the show's ringleaders and Natalie Wood's lovable cameo gave the ultimate touch of authenticity. Apart from that the result is rather forgettable lacking that spice we expect from a political satire. The Candidate could have been on the same prophetic wit as Network Wag the Dog or A Face in the Crowd but the film was as frustrating as McKay struggling during his speeches. Jeremy Larner might have won an Oscar but a Paddy Cheyefsky he ain't. And unfortunately the real highlight of the film happens to be the ending with the unforgettable what do we do now? that leaves Lucas and the viewers speechless. The film was so full of awkward painfultowatch moments can you imagine anything worse than a politician being speechless? fitting the film's anticlimactic realism but so frustrating for viewers who expect a few explosive outbursts. Redford remains an eternal enigma as a man we never quite see what goes on his mind on TV or during a speech challenging our patience but not rewarding it until the end when he's put in the position he couldn't cheat anymore. I didn't know what he was going to do but I guess I was glad they finally closed that door before we'd know. And that last minute gets me back to The Godfather again. The two films had similar opening and ending one defeat speech from men who hadn't the stuff to 'win the game' and a door closing on the 'winner'. As if Crime and politics were the two evil twins of power in America except that the first door was closed on an intimate room while the second left the protagonist with the public. And I'm not quite sure which is worse fooling the law in secrecy or fooling the public in total openness?".

	schema:reviewBody "Young Robert Redford son of a former California Governor Melvyn Douglas is a storefront lawyer devoting his time and talent to those who need his services. Coming from the well to do Redford can afford it. A couple of sharp eyed political operatives Peter Boyle and Allen Garfield spot him the way Paul Krichell must have spotted Lou Gehrig out at Columbia University and scout him like you would a prized first baseman. A man with no public record and some name recognition he might be just the guy to defeat three term conservative senator Don Porter.Redford takes a chance and wins the primary and then he's the candidate against Porter. But he slips more and more into the hands of Boyle and Garfield in order to win. In the end he takes the road not taken by Spencer Tracy in State of the Union.In many ways this might have been the easiest bit of casting for Robert Redford in his career. His positions as candidate Redford are in no way different than those of citizen Redford away from the movie set. Redford's certainly given enough of his time and treasure to candidates and causes he believes in. I'm willing to bet he's been opportuned many times to go into politics himself and he knows the game and how it's played.That's what The Candidate is really about the game and how it's played. Back in the days of the founding of America the biggest media outlet was the printed word. The political parties of the time the Federalists and Jeffersonian DemocratRepublicans had rival newspapers that slung some pretty nasty invective back and forth at each other and the print media held sway for over 150 years. Then radio and then network television supplanted the other and victory went to those who mastered those media. That's what Boyle and Garfield are spin doctors who know how to use the most advanced communication form of the day. If The Candidate is ever remade the characters of Boyle and Garfield will be those who use cable television and the internet.My favorite player in The Candidate however is Don Porter as United States Senator Crocker Jarman. Porter modeled his performance clearly on the current Governor of California Ronald Reagan who certainly mastered the media of his day. I think Crocker Jarman was probably Don Porter's career role and should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor.Dated though it is because of the advent of cable and the internet The Candidate if a prime candidate for a remake. Can you see Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio as Bill McKay talking about finding that better way and not quite sure what it is?".

Peter Boyle's party insider character appeals to the younger McKay by promising that he will not have to compromise his ideals and can run on the issues he believes are relevant simply because they have nothing to lose as the election is already lost anyway.The story unfolds when Bill McKay needs to ramp up his campaign just to get to the point where his candidacy is credible. Once the campaign gets credible the political machinery takes over and the ideals suffer.Other than how little the making of political candidates differs from today it's amazing to see issues being debated in 1972 that are still part of the debate today abortion race crime environment health care etc.. Very little is said about Vietnam which is surprising but to have a movie that names the political parties and addresses real issues in the manner politicians from the respective parties would shows a boldness no studio would touch nowadays i.e. Joan Allen's prochoice Republican in The Contender being named vice president by a Democrat yeah like that would happen.See it now see it 30 years from now it will still be relevant.".

However everything is not roses for Sawaki. Every night he gets completely sloshed and he seems to be impotent as well. One night while drunk of course Sawaki enters a convenience store and steals what appear to be a candy bar and a can of beer. He is caught and soon his picture is plastered in the papers. His boss tells him to lay low and hopefully the media will soon lose interest. Instead of studying his law books Sawaki seems determined to drink himself into oblivion. One night Renji Sawaki meets his kindred spirit Yuriko Koizumi Kyoko Blue Spring Milo and Otis hehe.Unlike Renji Yuriko's life is going nowhere fast. She is nearing her midthirties and works as a professional hostess in a bar and does more than just serve drinks. She is originally from Hokkaido and wants to return there to see her family. A Drunken Kenji agrees to travel with her into the mountains to see the last snow of the season but not for aesthetic purposes. It seems that one of the most peaceful ways to commit suicide is to take sleeping pills and fall asleep in the snow.As usual Asano does a stellar job of acting in this film. As sober Sawaki he is dead serious and has about as much sense of humor as a piece of wood but when he is drunk he tends to become quite humorous. Koizumi's character is adorable and her chemistry with Asano is stunning. Near the end of the film there is one scene that will definitely make one choke up.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a really great movie. The first few minutes are one long shot without any cut...and it tells a story covering several days! But not only the style is worth looking as the character development reaches an intensity only to be seen in Asian movies this is my totally subjective point of view. The story itself deals with a young girl getting adopted by a family that holds her like a slave and then being freed by a young man working for this familys company. 10 years later she gets involved in the murder of one of her stepsisters. This movie will please all the fans of films like Swallowtail Butterfly or even HanaBi.".
