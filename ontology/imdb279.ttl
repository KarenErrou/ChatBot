The plot is corny with a feelgood conclusion but James Stewart is always an attraction.

	schema:reviewBody "From the directoractor team that brought us many of the great westerns of the 1950s Thunder Bay teams Anthony Mann and James Stewart in what could easily be called a modern western.  Stewart plays Steve Martin an oil driller with a dream.  His goal is to build an offshore drill in the Gulf of Mexico.  He receives the financial backing of oil tycoon Kermit MacDonald Jay C. Flippen and begins work.He sets out from a small fishing community that has been on hard times lately.  They are leery of Stewart and his partner Johnny Gambi Dan Duryea at first and become more so when the two start blasting in the middle of their shrimp beds.  To make matters worse Johnny falls in love with a local girl who is already engaged to one of the fisherman.Tension builds as the fishermen continue to have bad luck and the drill progresses.  One disgruntled fisherman attempts to blow up the drill platform during the middle of a hurricane.  Stewart who had stayed on the platform to see how it would withstand the storm catches him just in time to save it.  A slippery fight ensues during which the fisherman and Stewart fight not only each other but a constant onslaught of water.  As in the typical western the hero Stewart wins and the villain dies.The fight scene is one that dates the film.  The special effects seem very archaic in wake of such recent films as Titanic and The Perfect Storm. Other than that the film presents an interesting story on what at the time was a very taboo subject.Aware of the controversy the film would stirup the film was carefully crafted to prove that two industries could exist side by side.  As the fishermen resolve to destroy the well Stewart discovers that his well has uncovered a new bed a shrimp.  When the fishermen learn this they decide that the well is indeed an asset to their community and all live happily ever after.As usual Stewart steals the film.  His acting is subtle and believable. The simple story did not push him as an actor but he is properly harried tough and laconic.  Overall this is an interesting film enhanced by the beautiful location shots filmed in Technicolor by William Daniels.  Truly an intriguing and different take on the western genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thunder Bay is an anomaly a pedantic film on a subject seldom dealt with in the movies the conflict between businessmen whose ambitions will cause great change in the local landscape and the locals who want things to remain as they are. In this case it's oil drillers versus shrimp fisherman in the Louisiana of the early 1950's. The conflict at times seems almost Marxian with James Stewart's hardheaded nononsense outsider going up against ragin' Cajun Gilbert Roland a far more charming and sympathetic figure. Rather than shy away from class conflict the movie confronts the issue repeatedly in a variety of ways and builds up a good deal of tension along the way as Stewart's compulsive oil drilling loner increasingly isolated takes on the entire community. There's a good deal of fifties sociology here with the modern innerdirected Stewart against the traditioncentered fishing people. Neither side understands the other as one can well see how these local folks would view Stewart as an uncaring and forbidding figure the embodiment of alien big city values. On the other hand these people are a rough and tumble lot uneducated clannish and utterly without curiosity. It's easy to see how an educated man might look down on them. There's a good deal of action along the way and some fistfights. At a time when many Americans still thought of themselves in terms of class and with the Depression fresh in everyone's minds it was rather bold of director Anthony Mann to take on this subject from a middle of the road basically Republican but not right wing perspective. In this respect the movie which came out in the first year of the Eisenhower administration heralded a new era of compromise with the promise of better things yet to come. As to which side is right well you be the judge. I'm still thinking this over.".

Stewart and buddy Dan Duryea invest all their own money in the design of a platform for ocean drilling and think the delta country in Louisiana is where oil is to be found.Stewart and Duryea meet all kinds of opposition from the French cajun shrimp fisherman in the area. And complicating the picture is a pair of sisters Joanne Dru and Marcia Henderson who fall for our heroes.At the time of Thunder Bay's production and release offshore oil drilling was a big controversy. Not over the environmental impact but over whether the states or the federal government would get the revenue. The states involved with offshore oil fought for and got a 12 mile limit in terms of taxable revenue. Pocketed a lot of tax dollars because of it.Thunder Bay mentions the environmental impact as it relates to the shrimp fisherman. But it carefully skirts any conclusions either for the oil men or the fishermen. We've seen enough oil accidents at sea since Thunder Bay was made to know what the impact is. We also know how important oil is to our nation and the world. Anthony Mann as director provides us no answers. My guess is he was primarily interested in making a film that entertains more than enlightens. The cast is a gifted group of players who do just that. Gilbert Roland as one of the leaders of the shrimp fishermen is good as he always is.One thing that does surprise me. Dan Duryea has not always played bad guys in film but he usually does. Usually when he gets involved with a woman she regrets it. I was expecting him to walk out on Marcia Henderson and do her wrong through out the film. Was I ever surprised when he actually marries her. Also in a key scene he gives Stewart a strong does of common sense medicine at a time he sorely needed it and proves to be someone who saves the situation for the oilmen at a critical point.You won't find any thought provoking questions raised about oil or the environment here but Thunder Bay is decent entertainment if wishy washy on the issues.".

There are two moments in the film which show changes in attitudes which are too fast to be accepted by the spectator first when Joanne Dru declares her love for James Stewart and second when the fishermen who came to fight with the men in the platform decide to go away after they strike oil. It is good to see three men who were responsible for the successful Winchester 73 together again. A beautiful and mature Joanne Dru is the woman trying to prevent her sister Marcia Henderson from falling in love with Dan Duryea because she made a mistake in the past. Stewart and Duryea are desperately trying to find the oil before the money finishes. Even though this is a minor work by Anthony Mann he knows how to tell a story and keep you entertained.".

	schema:headline " Big Oil versus Little Shrimp";
	schema:reviewBody "During the 1950s until the two famously fell out over the making of Night Passage Anthony Mann was James Stewart's favourite director. Their partnership is best remembered for the five socalled MannStewart westerns but they also made three nonwesterns together of which this is the second. Thunder Bay is a Canadian city on the shores of Lake Superior and there is a bay of the same name on the American side of Lake Huron but the film is not set in either location or for that matter anywhere in the Great Lakes. Instead it is set much further south in coastal Louisiana. The precise significance of the title is obscure but it may be a reference to the fact that a storm features in one scene. The action takes place in the year 1946. Steve Martin an engineer and his friend Johnny Gambi arrive in the small fishing port of Port Felicity in order to build an offshore oil drilling platform. They are not however popular with the local people. The main industry in the area is fishing especially for shrimp and the fishermen believe that any exploration for oil will put their livelihood at risk. The word shrimp in American usage obviously denotes something far larger than it would in Britain. We would call what the fisherman catch prawns or scampi shrimp refers to a similar but much smaller species of crustacean. Hence the expression little shrimp to mean a small person. An added complication is the romance which grows up between Steve and Stella the beautiful and intelligent daughter of one of the fishermen. Stella is bettereducated than most of her fellow townspeople and is one of the few with experience of the outside world having worked in Chicago. She is however also one of the fiercest opponents of the oil drilling project having been left with a deep distrust of the business community and of outsiders in general by an unhappy loveaffair with a cityslicker type in Chicago. One reviewer describes the conflict in this movie as almost Marxian but this strikes me as overstated. Marxists have normally seen the class struggle in terms of employeremployee relationships something largely absent from this film. What we see here is the clash of big business against small business Big Oil versus Little Shrimp. Rather surprisingly at least from a modern perspective the film generally takes the side of Big Oil. The shrimpers with the exception of one who resorts to violence are not exactly cast as the villains of the piece but they are shown as Luddites standing in the way of America's inevitable progress towards a golden industrial future. Steve Johnny and their financial backer Kermit MacDonald are the good guys because they are on the side of that future. The only bad guys on the big business side are the fainthearts in the company who threaten to cut off funding when Steve seems to be making slow progress in finding oil. The special effects during the storm scene probably did look special in the early fifties but today in comparison with something like The Perfect Storm they are nothing much. What really dates the film however is its complacent assumption that it is in the public interest for big business to get whatever big business wants. Any environmental objections to its plans can simply be brushed aside or made to disappear as if by magic as happens here. Rather improbably Steve and Johnny not only strike oil but also discover a rich new source of shrimp which ensures lasting wealth and prosperity for Port Felicity and removes any obstacle to the love of Steve and Stella. The MannStewart westerns include some excellent films such as The Man from Laramie and The Naked Spur which brought to the genre a new emphasis on the importance of character and a greater moral complexity than the old white hats versus black hats formula. Their nonwestern collaborations however are not always up to the same standard. I have never seen The Glenn Miller Story but Strategic Air Command is overlong and dull and Thunder Bay is not a lot better although it is at least shorter. This is not Stewart's best performance at times he just seems to be going through the motions and Dan Duryea seems a bit too abrasive as Johnny. There is not the same emphasis on welldeveloped characters as in the Mann Stewart westerns and the plot is really just a romantic comedy set against the background of the oil industry although without very much humour. Any tension or conflict is allowed to evaporate by that magic ending. Thunder Bay looks very dated today and not only by the fact that the scriptwriter used the name Kermit for a character who wasn't a talking frog. Although in 1953 the Muppets only lay two years in the future. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Thunder Bay is an excellent film starring my favorite actor James Stewart who teamed up with director Anthony Mann to create some of Stewart's finest work from the 1950s including five rocksolid Westerns. Critical reaction to this film appears to be mixed tending to lead toward the negative. In fact some claim Thunder Bay to be the weakest of the eight StewartMann features but I disagree. This is an exciting adventure story about having a dream and taking risks  facing a wide range of obstacles to pursue that dream. In the case of Thunder Bay the dream is to unleash the oil buried deep into the Gulf of Mexico and the risks  obstacles involve physical and emotional battles with a community of fishermen who object to having an oil crew move in. Steve Martin Stewart and Johnny Gambi Dan Duryea are two downontheirluck oil wildcatters who decide to take the plunge on a threemonth lease to gather a hardworking crew to construct an oil rig.

Fisherman Teche Bossier Gilbert Roland picks friendly circle fights with both sheriff Antoine Fortunio Bonanova and Gambi in order to settle who pays for the drinks the fight with Gambi occurs while nearly everybody is boisterously drunk.

And let us not forget the contributions of all the other lead and supporting actors such as Joanne Dru Gilbert Roland Dan Duryea Antonio Moreno and Jay C.

	onyx:emotionText "Thunder Bay is an excellent film starring my favorite actor James Stewart who teamed up with director Anthony Mann to create some of Stewart's finest work from the 1950s including five rocksolid Westerns. Critical reaction to this film appears to be mixed tending to lead toward the negative. In fact some claim Thunder Bay to be the weakest of the eight StewartMann features but I disagree. This is an exciting adventure story about having a dream and taking risks  facing a wide range of obstacles to pursue that dream. In the case of Thunder Bay the dream is to unleash the oil buried deep into the Gulf of Mexico and the risks  obstacles involve physical and emotional battles with a community of fishermen who object to having an oil crew move in. Steve Martin Stewart and Johnny Gambi Dan Duryea are two downontheirluck oil wildcatters who decide to take the plunge on a threemonth lease to gather a hardworking crew to construct an oil rig. Stewart proved an excellent choice for the role as the harddriving ramrod Steve and Duryea puts his own signature on the somewhat lackluster funloving Gambi.

	schema:headline " Exciting epic offshore oilern with some problems in screenplay details and casting";
	schema:reviewBody "Beats me why this Technicolor film was titled Thunder Bay which is the name of a Canadian city on Lake Superior and the associated little 'bay' with no obvious connection to this story about the first distant offshore oil rig emplaced in the Gulf of Mexico. Perhaps refers to the often stormy relations between the principals? There was some thunder associated with the very dramatic sequence when a hurricane hit soon after the rig was finished but before oil was struck. Not only was SteveJames Stewart alone on the rig except for StellaJoanne Dru a shrimp boat carrying jilted lover Phillipe approached and a bundle of dynamite sticks was attached to the rig hoping to blow it up and blame it on the storm. While waves dashed over them and the fuse burned they fought on the open platform until Phillipe fell into the sea. Beats me why the boat wasn't pitched into the rig probably wrecking both. Steve's assumption that Stella was in on the sabotage plan also makes no sense. If successful she would have died along with Steve! Steve stays mad at her after this until the finale when assured that she was not involved.This was just one of a whole series of crises that threatened to bring an end to this pioneering endeavor. Twice  lynching mobs of local fishermen threatened Steve and his workers. Incredibly Steve dispersed the first mob by throwing sticks of dynamite near them! The resulting 'explosions' looked and sounded like flares rather than dynamite! The final confrontation near the end was dissipated by the serendipitous spectacle of a gusher as the mob swarmed onto the rig platform combined with news that the long sought 'golden shrimp' bed had been discovered around the drill site. This last facet comes across as an unlikely fabrication to placate the concern that oil production in the Gulf might have a severe negative effect on commercial fisheries. There is no such thing as a commercial 'golden' shrimp in the Gulf! Yes big oil spills have since caused marine life devastation. However oil rigs also encourage many forms of life acting as artificial reefs especially important where natural reefs have being dying out. We are presently confronted with the debate whether depleted rigs should be removed or remain to promote sea life.This story has some historical credibility in that it takes place in 19467 when the first oil rig far off the Gulf coast actually was emplaced. Most of the film was appropriately shot on the LA Gulf coast. Stewart plays a Horatio Algerlike figure who along with his faithful partner played by Dan Duryea begin the film penniless armed only with a model of how to build an offshore rig that could withstand hurricanes. They have to convince not only the beleaguered president of the oil companyplayed by Jay Flippen but also the local fishermen that their scheme is worth the risk. The former proves much easier than the latter.A secondary aspect of the plot involves two beautiful flirtatious Nordiclooking daughters of an elderly Latino fisherman who have a strong hankering to leave this little backwater village and find Stewart's and Duryea's characters convenient prospects toward a more exciting affluent life. Unfortunately papa doesn't like losing his daughters to these outsiders expecting that they would marry fishermen like himself. Joanne Dru's characterStella has baggage of a hurtful 3 year romance in Chicago. She and Steve spend the film alternatively hating and loving each other. Marcia Henderson playing Stella's more nave younger sister develops a more stable relationship with Duryea. But we suspect he is not really a right man for her too old and a potential drunkard. Duryea mostly played villains and his role as Stewart's sometimes disapproving sidekick doesn't feel quite comfortable.If you like stories about oil discoveries you might check out some of the following films I am familiar with Boom Town1940 Flowing Gold1940 Tulsa1949 and Joe Dakota1957. Of these Tulsa has the most similar plot to the present film. It's a war between cattle and oil interests. In place of poor Cajun fishermen the oil interests have to deal with Native Americans. In the end its decided that cattle and oil like shrimp and oil can get along well enough. Another film the present film reminds me of is the 1936 Trail of the Lonesome Pinealso shot in Technicolor believe it or not!. Fred Mac Murray takes on Stewart's role as the representative of a coal company that wants to mine the coal on land belonging to warring backwoodsmen. Again there is a bittersweet romance with one of the 'native' girls.".

Huge credits in relentlessly white letters with serrated edges alphabetical lightning bolts splash across the screen. And the credits are all over with in a minute or two.What follows is the story of  nope not Thunder Bay Michigan where James Stewart was to shoot a later film but a small town in Louisiana. Stewart and Duryea manage to finagle some financing in an attempt to realize Stewart's dream of building the first offshore oil rig. It has to be a dream an obsession like Tucker and his car because the alternative isn't very flattering to Stewart. Why are you doing this? asks Joanne Dru Will it make you rich? Stewart Not especially. We can permit ourselves a bit of a chuckle at this point I think. The oil industry is fulfilling its dream and all that. But Stewart tries to explain to Dru why he is so driven. Really he does! And it comes out something like Mebbe you don't know how oil is made. You see there were these dinosaurs.... And he winds up telling her that he's trying to capture a little bit of time of prehistory and that money couldn't mean less to him. What's money after all? Just a piece of paper crawling with germs. No  wait. That's a different movie. At any rate you get the idea.The whole movie is equally simple minded and equally enjoyable in its politically incorrect recklessness. The Cajun fishermen of the village all of whom are of Hispanic origin but what the hell are hostile to Stewart Dan Duryea and the other oil men. There are two RomeoandJuliet sorts of romances. Dynamite explosions. A fist fight to the death on a swaying oil rig in the middle of a hurricane.A lot of people find Stewart unfailingly engaging and I agree that he's a fine actor. Dan Duryea is his libidinous sidekick and supplies most of the wisecracks. He's not an actor with any range. Imagine him as a respectable shrink. And he looks slimy like an evil Bob Fosse and his voice is piping and always vaguely sinister but I always enjoy him anyway. Gilbert Roland plays Gilbert Roland the hairy chested man of action and gallantry who laughs off danger. At one point in the movie he tries to project major guilt and break into a sob which is a mistake. The rest of the cast provides us with a lot of familiar faces.It seems that Anthony Mann never directed Jimmy Stewart without turning him into a neurotic and his obsession here alienates everyone around him. But not to worry. It all ends happily. The men get their oil the villagers get their golden shrimp and Stewart and Duryea get their girls. This is the 1950s. It ought to be in a time capsule.".

They are classicsevery one of themranging from WINCHESTER '73 to THE FAR COUNTRY to THE MAN FROM LARAMIE. However they also made one nonWestern together and this is that film. Considering the track record I certainly expected so much more from this film. Instead of the usual highcaliber work this film was amazingly flat and uninspiring despite having a very original story. I guess you can't win 'em all! Oddly the film begins with Stewart and Dan Duryea as pals who are out to make a deal on an offshore oil rig. I say this is odd because usually Duryea plays bad guys and NEVER buddies of the leading man. However in this film he is a basically good guythough he does have a hint of larceny about him! The oil rig is at first welcomed by the local shrimp boat operators. However when they find that the oil company is using dynamite to help them detect oil deposits they are afraid of losing their livelihoods and violently oppose the drilling. It is actually an interesting look at the 1950s as Stewart is portrayed as the good guy and the dynamiting is explained away very gliblysaying it won't cause any lasting harm to the environment! As an avid fisherman I didn't buy this explanationnor did the shrimpers. But the damage had already been done and the location for the well was determined quickly before the boat owners could do anything to stop this. The rest of the film follows the up and down relationship between the two factions until ultimately everyone is happy and the film endsespecially when they discover that the oil platforms are great attractants for sea life.The problem with all this is that while this might be modestly interesting from a historical sense none of this seems compelling enough for a film. Plus some of the characters in the film seem a bit stupid and tough to believeapart from Duryea and Stewart. The film just seemed to lack energy or lasting appeal though it was mildly diverting enough to merit a 6.".

Like the earlier movie this is an intensely serious drama about issues of sexuality and denial.

Much of the story's development is psychological and not related to the specific period in history... if anything the characters occasionally seem too modern but it's impossible for me to say whether this is actually the case perhaps done intentionally by the director and screenwriter or whether my impression of how they should have been behaving in the mid1960s is colored too much by massmedia images from that time.In any case Altman and screenwriter David Rabe do a good job of confounding the audience's expectations and providing us with multifaceted complex characters and there are some moments of chilling beauty as when two older sergeants tell stories of paratroopers who didn't make it. While the issues involved and the serious tone will probably turn a lot of people off this is a worthy member of the Altman canon and well worth seeking out by anyone who is interested in his filmed plays of the 80s or in seeing him work on a small scale.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jesus H Christ. You know what I'm doing? You know what I'm standing here doing? I'm a 24 year old college graduate. God damn intellectual type. And I got a knife in my hand thinking about coming up behind one black human being and I'm thinking I wanna cut his throat! That is ridiculous man! You think I need a reputation as a killer? You want to be a bad ass animal go! Get it on! But I wash my hands man! I'm not human as you are!  Mathew Modine Streamers Like Secret Honor Come Back To The Five and Dime Jimmy Dean and Fool For Love Streamers is another Robert Altman film based on a stage play and filmed almost entirely indoors at a single location.The film focuses on a group of US soldiers who are waiting to be shipped out to Vietnam. Altman's camera prowls their cramped barracks watching as they struggle to pass the time. They argue joke and throw insults but the script is flat and the cast only comes alive spectacularly so during a couple explosive scenes.What's most interesting about the film is Mathew Modine's character. Modine plays Billy a smart kid who sees himself as existing outside of the other men. While the other soldiers are black homosexuals or come from low income families Billy is middle class and well educated. Toward the end of the film Billy is killed by one character who despises Billy's aloofness. Billy can't stand the other men their latent homosexuality their poverty their drunkenness the way they readily give in to desire and so essentially seems to have been killed because his very existence shames the other men.So Mathew Modine essentially plays the same character here that he plays in Full Metal Jacket the outsider on the inside though in Kubrick's film he further protects himself with a jacket of ironic detachment. That film was about a very specific type of disassociation killing but not perceiving oneself as partaking. Murdering but interpreting such actions as righteous kills.Though Kubrick scoured thousands of audition tapes when casting Full Metal Jacket Modine was the one actor he had mentally cast prior to conducting auditions. Kubrick was a big Altman fan and kept a close eye on the director's work. He cast Shelly Duvall in The Shining based on her performance in Altman's 3 Women and is reported to have admired McCabe and Mrs Miller. Both directors actually bumped into one another outside a theatre in England Altman having just watched Clockwork Orange and Kubrick having just seen McCabe and Mrs Miller.A decade later Kubrick saw Modine in Streamers and immediately began enquiries about the actor. He learnt that Modine was currently working on Alan Parker's underrated Birdy another film in which Modine played a Vietnam soldier. Kubrick secretly sent Alan Parker a request asking for footage of Modine and received it several weeks later. Upon seeing the footage Kubrick was convinced that he had found the right Jokerman for his Full Metal Jacket.What's interesting about Kubrick's casting methods is the way he in a sense casts archetypes or rather type cast actors. Jack Nicholson was cast in The Shining because his previous films had established him as a misogynist and psychopath. Modine was cast in Full Metal Jacket because he had established himself as a military outsider and intellectual jarhead. Tom Cruise was cast in Eyes Wide Shut because he had established himself as a egotistical self centred little man brainwashed by cults.There's a practicality a sense of machine logic to the way Kubrick casts. Real couples play real couples. A real Jack and Danny play a real Jack and Danny. A real drill Sergeant plays a real drill Sergeant. Likewise a Jewish film director famous for conspiracy thrillers Sydney Pollack plays a mysterious puppet master. And on and on it goes.Streamers may not be a dramatically satisfying piece of work but it is interesting in the way it positions itself within all the Vietnam movies of the 70s and 80s. For example unlike the ultra macho Rambo Altman treats his entire cast with a weird sexual ambiguity. We get the sense that this small group of men has been assigned their own private barracks because they're all homosexuals or outcasts in some way. There are also strange parallels with Full Metal Jacket. Consider the way one homosexual in Altman's film tries to commit suicide feeling too effeminate too much of an outcast for the military. Kubrick's film does the opposite a character called Pyle committing suicide as a result of sexual overidentification. One's too much of a wimp for the military the other's too much of a killer.In Altman's film Billy also reluctantly visits a whorehouse. He has sex with a woman in order to prove that he fits in and is one of the boys. This mirrors Joker's actions in Full Metal Jacket where Joker shoots and rapes a woman in order to fit in. The irony of Altman's film is that Billy is trying to fit in with guys who are themselves repressing their homosexuality in the face of the military's grotesque hypermasculinity fitting in with those trying to fit in all identity a performance a sham. And of course this masculinity is often always a mask the soldier persona a thin veneer over fragile personalities wounded egos and personal neuroses. It's the lesson Billy learns by the film's end as his veins empty blood.610  Cut 40 minutes from this film and you have a lean drama with a couple explosive scenes. As it is this is a dull stage play which only comes alive when Mathew Modine is on screen. Altman's camera work is ugly his set is drab his pacing awful and his caricaturing of homosexuals at times insulting.".

He cast Shelly Duvall in The Shining based on her performance in Altman's 3 Women and is reported to have admired McCabe and Mrs Miller. Both directors actually bumped into one another outside a theatre in England Altman having just watched Clockwork Orange and Kubrick having just seen McCabe and Mrs Miller.A decade later Kubrick saw Modine in Streamers and immediately began enquiries about the actor. He learnt that Modine was currently working on Alan Parker's underrated Birdy another film in which Modine played a Vietnam soldier. Kubrick secretly sent Alan Parker a request asking for footage of Modine and received it several weeks later. Upon seeing the footage Kubrick was convinced that he had found the right Jokerman for his Full Metal Jacket.What's interesting about Kubrick's casting methods is the way he in a sense casts archetypes or rather type cast actors. Jack Nicholson was cast in The Shining because his previous films had established him as a misogynist and psychopath. Modine was cast in Full Metal Jacket because he had established himself as a military outsider and intellectual jarhead. Tom Cruise was cast in Eyes Wide Shut because he had established himself as a egotistical self centred little man brainwashed by cults.There's a practicality a sense of machine logic to the way Kubrick casts. Real couples play real couples. A real Jack and Danny play a real Jack and Danny. A real drill Sergeant plays a real drill Sergeant. Likewise a Jewish film director famous for conspiracy thrillers Sydney Pollack plays a mysterious puppet master. And on and on it goes.Streamers may not be a dramatically satisfying piece of work but it is interesting in the way it positions itself within all the Vietnam movies of the 70s and 80s. For example unlike the ultra macho Rambo Altman treats his entire cast with a weird sexual ambiguity. We get the sense that this small group of men has been assigned their own private barracks because they're all homosexuals or outcasts in some way. There are also strange parallels with Full Metal Jacket. Consider the way one homosexual in Altman's film tries to commit suicide feeling too effeminate too much of an outcast for the military. Kubrick's film does the opposite a character called Pyle committing suicide as a result of sexual overidentification. One's too much of a wimp for the military the other's too much of a killer.In Altman's film Billy also reluctantly visits a whorehouse. He has sex with a woman in order to prove that he fits in and is one of the boys. This mirrors Joker's actions in Full Metal Jacket where Joker shoots and rapes a woman in order to fit in. The irony of Altman's film is that Billy is trying to fit in with guys who are themselves repressing their homosexuality in the face of the military's grotesque hypermasculinity fitting in with those trying to fit in all identity a performance a sham. And of course this masculinity is often always a mask the soldier persona a thin veneer over fragile personalities wounded egos and personal neuroses. It's the lesson Billy learns by the film's end as his veins empty blood.610  Cut 40 minutes from this film and you have a lean drama with a couple explosive scenes. As it is this is a dull stage play which only comes alive when Mathew Modine is on screen. Altman's camera work is ugly his set is drab his pacing awful and his caricaturing of homosexuals at times insulting.";

The war the heroic war is supposed to bring the best of man in the limelight of their personalities. It sure brings the deepest layers of all human beings in the foreground. So imagine a bunch of macho young men black and white plus a few older Non Commissioned Officers who are having no real private life because they spend their life killing enemies they despise. Who would marry these men who are never home and who spend their time shoulder deep in blood? Their complicity becomes complacent and we can wonder what makes them go on behaving like bad boys who only want to play hide and go seek. The draftees are not better but they are younger so they don't know about bees and flowers and birds and flying fish. And their sexuality is both in great conformity with the standard public norm and absolutely uncertain and fuzzy. Bring one real gay man in that bunch and what was only vaguely misty in the background becomes sunny bright in the foreground. The college graduate who was cool about it turns aggressive and even violent. Unluckily a black hustler is a lot better trained at self defending himself. The young college graduate will die in his own running blood. One of the older NCOs will come along and as drunk as a barrel of gin he will run into the situation and against the hustler who will puncture him good and well once and for all. It is then the survivors finally understand what they are in for. The gay young man will start crying  a clich mind you  and the others will hide or try to ignore the mess. The only interesting element in this film is the acting of the bunch of actors who are holding the screen and the audience for nearly two hours. They act so well so much like on an intimate theater stage that we totally enter the game and believe it.

There is actually a preview of the latter on this film if you have a VHS copy which I luckily do. Streamers works mainly cause of the powerful performances notably Michael Wright what you may call a deserter off his nut who crashes a dorm of Vets still waiting on their orders to fight that notorious and unforgotten war. He's so powerfully unsettling because you don't what he'' do next. It's like watching a bi polar patient. The other notable performance is that of Guy Boyd a great underused actor as a gung ho sergeant who sadly you don't see much of him in this either. Modine is very strong too as Wright's rival while Mitchell Lichstein is unforgettably great as the gay homo cadet who brings so much to the role an array of emotions. What happened to him? Streamers is basically a character driven one scene movie where the tenseness and anxiousness shows in these pre Vet soldiers one young kid slashing his wrists at the start to get a pardon with one of the creepiest faces I've ever seen. If part of this character I give the actor full credit. David Allen Grier a good underrated actor plays another black GI and Wright's friend. The atmosphere of these actors doing their thing in a confined set is electric even the smaller performances as we near it's end after a double tragedy were great. The films not for everyone as there are some confronting issues in what in a pull no punches tale of innocence lost and tempers flaring of a bunch of apprehensive soldiers waiting to partake in that ugly war. The highpoint is watching a drunk Guy Boyd and he's like this for all his scenes singing instead of Beautiful Dreamer Beautiful Streamers. George Dzunda delivers too especially near the end as Boyd's compadre. The marching gun display in perfect cadence at the start and end credits in frighteningly unsurpassable.

	schema:reviewBody "Love  Pop is simply a mind blowing flick with lots to say. To start with Hideaki Anno is without a doubt an artistic genius Neon Genesis Evangelion leaves no doubt about it. In here Hideaki Anno takes us in a tour about school girls perverts and compensated dating. The story takes us trough something that happens in japan called compensated dating normal guys or perverts pay school girls to date them with or without second intentions. This innocent girls do this in a regular basis to get money for their personal materialistic needs buy clothesrings etc. You see them talking about boys school life and feelings. You get it all and identify with lots of thoughts that are thrown at you just like the existential dilemmas in NGE some are deep thoughts that we are not used to put in words. Hideaki Anno at the same time he tells the story takes us on a visual tour i think he has used all is NGE crazy cameraworks and put it on real tape and invented some more all the follow cameras angles fish eye lenses and whatever more you could imagine even cameras in a microwave and in soup bowl. It's just something to see cant be described it is excellent and he filmed it all with mini DV cameras switching between 43 and 169 like he doesn't care for rules or limitations.SPOILERS Continuing with the story the main character Hiromi sees a ring she wants to buy and goes out alone doing compensated dating for it something they never did they never dated alone. She ends up on a date with Captain EO Tadanobu Asano that will teach her a valuable lesson about life and about what she does. And right here is the value of the film a boring tale about innocent school girls makes lots of sense because of a few minutes of film. The girls are not that innocent everything trought the movie seems so normal in their perspective and they seem so innocent that we are blinded. And in the end it makes sense. Captain EO shows an aggressive face suddenly but spares Hiromi saying You're here naked and you are killing someone half dead with grief over it. Meaning she has value and someone gives her value but she is not seeing it or experiencing she's not thinking about what she is looking for. She is being selfish and blind and whoever gives her value will be hurt for what she does. I think the idea speaks for itself.Hideaki Anno is a great director and i am looking forward to see more movies directed by him. I gave this 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about pedophilia perversion and prostitution through the eyes of 1517 year old high school girls. It was filmed entirely using mini digital cameras mounted in bizarre places like in a bowl of soup on a pair of chopsticks and up a girl's skirt.OK if that didn't scare you off then please continue reading.It's a heavy disturbing subject right off the bat. That plus the unconventional camerawork rings of pretentious art house film. But somehow Hideaki Anno pulls it off. I suspect that it's because this is a sort of tongueincheek pretentious art house film. Unlike certain snotty Cannes Film Festival contenders who seem to take themselves too seriously Anno deliberately goes way over the top as if to say Yes I am a very strange man who likes to put cameras in microwave ovens. As a result the mood of this film is a cross between CLOCKWORK ORANGE and AIRPLANE 2. Take it or leave it.You might be wondering why I rated it only 610 despite the fact that I seem to be praising it. You see I've rated it on my special HideakiAnnometer which grades on a much tougher scale. True it's a worthwhile film. But relative to some of his other work this comes across as a bit experimental and fractured.His later work SHIKIJITSU is the perfection of what we see here. You'll even notice many recurring trademarks such as train tracks red lighting and countdown intertitles. In the two years following LOVE  POP Hideaki Anno mastered the style he dabbled in here.But oh wait I forgot about the music. I may have to bump my rating up to a 7. As with SHIKIJITSU he matches the perfect doleful piano pieces with poetic voiceover narration. In particular I recognized a few Chopin sonatas Debussy's Claire de lune and 1 or 2 other haunting melodies. Despite the vulgarity of the subject matter these classicalromantic pieces provide a very interesting counterbalance. And I believe that is the whole theme of the film the precarious balance between perversion and innocence.It's certainly a memorable film. But it requires some patience. Be sure to stick around for the 2nd half when things get REALLY weird.".

	schema:reviewBody "Switching from animation to live action is always going to prove interesting as to how a director approaches the new medium particularly when that director previously held the reigns over Neon Genesis Evangelion. His first feature featuring real humans the anime background of Hideaki Anno is clear in his film Love  Pop as well as some of the themes present throughout his career.To start it is clear that we are not watching a film from a conventional director. Numerous handheld cameras are used in close proximity to the cast covering every conceivable angle resulting in an endless stream of edits that leave the viewer disorientated as to who and what they are seeing. Love  Pop is a film that many could quickly turn off within the opening couple of minutes plot and characters difficult to initially establish. But for those of us that realise that some of the quick edits include under the table shots of girls in short skirts the more of the film that is watched the more the collection of edits grows into an innovative film mirroring the youth culture it captures.Hiromi Nao Chisa and Chieko are four count them friends who spend their days around the concrete playground of Shibuya Tokyo. Though with the onslaught of edits it's a little difficult to really establish who is who and any nuance of character. But what becomes clear is that these are not girls up to innocent activities but are partaking in enjo kosai high school girls performing various acts in exchange for rectangular pieces of paper with dead people's faces and numbers printed on them. Acquiring a phone with which they can leave flirtatious messages the girls wonder the streets over a twentyfour hour period meeting various men along the way. Shopping for bikinis for a planned trip to the beach the story develops when Hiromi spies an expensive ring in a department store. Needing money the girls set about earning enough to buy it. It's at this point when focus switches more to Hiromi and you feel the editing and camera movements calm down a little whether they actually do or not. Meeting two men in separate encounters she is forced to realise that quick money earned may get her the things she wants but will leave her feeling lessthanpositive about herself. After meeting with a shutin to accompany him on a trip to the video store which results in a session of unwanted pocket billiards she then converses with the mysterious Captain X on the phone the group have been using. Being that this is a film made within two years of the new millennium Tadanobu Asano takes up this role taking her to a love hotel only to angrily berate her for stripping naked in front of a man she has just met in exchange for money. Slowing the pace down towards the film's conclusions Hiromi meets with the phone's owner who provides words of advice for her which leave her feeling she is better off at home with her family rather than wondering the streets in seedy encounters. The ring left un purchased despite raising the funds Hiromi is more assured is herself than the lost girl of the film's beginning.The film's progress adequately reflects Hiromi starting as a messy collection of shots Hiromi unsure of what she really wants in life distracted by the endless flashing lights of the various media that surround the modern world. But gradually these become more focused resulting in two key scenes which leave an impact on her ending in a more settled and calm manner. In this sense Anno's live action debut is accomplished filmmaking putting the audience through a day in Hiromi's head. Looking at the lives of teenage girls and youth searching for direction this is very much in keeping with much of Anno's anime work though more importantly tackles the phenomenon of enjo kosai and how quickly and easily teenage girls find themselves in dangerous situations in the simple pursuit of a few quid. Based on Ryu Murakami's book Topaz II Anno neither glorifies nor vilifies the girls  or indeed their male clients  showing it as an almost normal part of daily life. And this is perhaps where the problem lies. Perhaps fittingly for a film of such high editing the end credits accompany a long take of the four girls walking through the sewage ways of Shibuya in unison to close an unconventional approach to cinema but one that definitely has its merits. Followed by Ritual a couple of years later it is perhaps a shame that Anno has stuck to working mainly in anime  the recent Shin Godzilla aside  though one's lost will always be the other's gain. politic1983.blogspot.co.uk".

But for those of us that realise that some of the quick edits include under the table shots of girls in short skirts the more of the film that is watched the more the collection of edits grows into an innovative film mirroring the youth culture it captures.Hiromi Nao Chisa and Chieko are four count them friends who spend their days around the concrete playground of Shibuya Tokyo. Though with the onslaught of edits it's a little difficult to really establish who is who and any nuance of character. But what becomes clear is that these are not girls up to innocent activities but are partaking in enjo kosai high school girls performing various acts in exchange for rectangular pieces of paper with dead people's faces and numbers printed on them. Acquiring a phone with which they can leave flirtatious messages the girls wonder the streets over a twentyfour hour period meeting various men along the way. Shopping for bikinis for a planned trip to the beach the story develops when Hiromi spies an expensive ring in a department store. Needing money the girls set about earning enough to buy it. It's at this point when focus switches more to Hiromi and you feel the editing and camera movements calm down a little whether they actually do or not. Meeting two men in separate encounters she is forced to realise that quick money earned may get her the things she wants but will leave her feeling lessthanpositive about herself. After meeting with a shutin to accompany him on a trip to the video store which results in a session of unwanted pocket billiards she then converses with the mysterious Captain X on the phone the group have been using. Being that this is a film made within two years of the new millennium Tadanobu Asano takes up this role taking her to a love hotel only to angrily berate her for stripping naked in front of a man she has just met in exchange for money. Slowing the pace down towards the film's conclusions Hiromi meets with the phone's owner who provides words of advice for her which leave her feeling she is better off at home with her family rather than wondering the streets in seedy encounters. The ring left un purchased despite raising the funds Hiromi is more assured is herself than the lost girl of the film's beginning.The film's progress adequately reflects Hiromi starting as a messy collection of shots Hiromi unsure of what she really wants in life distracted by the endless flashing lights of the various media that surround the modern world. But gradually these become more focused resulting in two key scenes which leave an impact on her ending in a more settled and calm manner. In this sense Anno's live action debut is accomplished filmmaking putting the audience through a day in Hiromi's head. Looking at the lives of teenage girls and youth searching for direction this is very much in keeping with much of Anno's anime work though more importantly tackles the phenomenon of enjo kosai and how quickly and easily teenage girls find themselves in dangerous situations in the simple pursuit of a few quid. Based on Ryu Murakami's book Topaz II Anno neither glorifies nor vilifies the girls  or indeed their male clients  showing it as an almost normal part of daily life. And this is perhaps where the problem lies. Perhaps fittingly for a film of such high editing the end credits accompany a long take of the four girls walking through the sewage ways of Shibuya in unison to close an unconventional approach to cinema but one that definitely has its merits. Followed by Ritual a couple of years later it is perhaps a shame that Anno has stuck to working mainly in anime  the recent Shin Godzilla aside  though one's lost will always be the other's gain. politic1983.blogspot.co.uk";

An exciting coming of age an exhilarating comedy a deep and painful portrait of our society at the present moment.Caterina Va in Citt has outrageously funny scenes  starting with Giancarlo's biting farewell to his despised smalltown students.

His wife Agata Margherita Buy lives in a shell rather than get in the way of her grandiose husband. Caterina Alice Teghil is thrust uneasily into a social scene she's thoroughly unprepared for made even more out of place by her dad's instructions.

	schema:reviewBody "Paolo Virzi's Caterina va in citta is a film where he decided to throw his own personal take in the Italian society of the present. Mr. Virzi is a director of talent. In this film he decides to give us a disarming heroine Caterina who is at the center of two opposing factions the left and the right.At the beginning of the film we meet Giancarlo Iacovani who is a teacher in a northwest coastal town perhaps in Tuscany. He is telling his boring students how he has hated them for making his life miserable while trying to teach them something as he is bailing out to his native Rome where he is finally been transferred.His daughter Caterina the intense and earnest teen ager is seen practicing in the chorus and she gets carried away singing the beautiful music she adores. She appears not too keen on the moving to Rome. The area where they are moving to seems to be a place where chaos reigns and where the apartments are so close to one another that the young girls can see all what's going on with all the neighbors across the street.As Caterina is going to start classes a proud Giancarlo is seen taking her to her first day of school at the same one where he has gone himself years before. The class Caterina joins is an unruly place where the young people are clearly from two different factions those with money and right wing sympathizers or those with money but left wingers leaning into communism. Caterina is made feel unwelcome for sticking out as she doesn't belong with one group or the other.Upon going home from the first day of school and showing her father Giancarlo the names of her classmates he becomes impressed because most of the students seem to be connected to who's who in Rome! Caterina is accepted first by Margherita the rebel with left wing parents. Caterina learns this girl has gotten rid of her father's manuscript which he had sent to Margherita's mother an editor. Then Daniela the leader of the opposite faction takes her under her wing and sophisticates her appearance. At the end Caterina realizes Daniella is no friend either. The affection that Daniela's cousin shows to Caterina is thwarted when her snobbish mother makes a point to tell him to stop seeing the provincial girl.The film keeps a fast pace that works for the movie. It seems that Mr. Virzi parallels the life in Rome to what we are seeing. The city alas has the wrong effect in Giancarlo who is suspended from his teaching post and as he tries to fight for it he is made aware he doesn't amount to anything and decides to take off on his own after he fixes his old motorcycle. It is clear at this point that Agata the long suffering wife has had it with his ups and downs as she finds solace with Fabietto the kind bachelor friend.The best thing in the film is Alice Teghil who as Caterina is seen exploring new things that ultimately can't compare with the life she had in the small town she came from with all its problems and small mindedness. Sergio Castellito plays the strident Giancarlo a man that comes unglued in pursuing his dream of returning to the capital with little success once he is there. Margherita Buy a beautiful actress has little to do as Agata the long suffering wife of Giancarlo. She is the only sane person we encounter in the film.As the bad girls Carolina Iaquaniello is the grungyItalianstylelike Margherita the girl grown among the intellectual crowd. Federica Sberema plays Daniela the rich girl who is a mess and who moves with a fast crowd. The supporting cast do a good job.The best part is the ending in which we watch the radiant Caterina doing what she does best singing to her heart's content!".

	schema:reviewBody "Was impressed with the locations that the film makers chose film the externals.The school Luchino Visconti is THE school that the roman elite has traditionally placed their kids. The curriculum here is pretty heavy in ancient Greek and Latin texts.The town of Montalto Di Castro shown in the beginning and the end. BTW it is not in Tuscany as many other commenter's claim but still in the region of Lazio. The beach scene at the end shows a huge power plant in the background. That is a nuclear energy plant and saying you are from Montalto Di Castro is synonymous to saying you are from Three Mile Island or Chernobyl. The folks there are on the front line should there be a radiation leak.The rundown Tuscanlooking farmhouse where Margherita's father is living his second and already struggling marriage. Stereotypical living quarters of washeddown intellectuals.The town of Sabbaudia where Daniela's father travels to to attend a wedding. It was entirely built by Mussolini in the 1930's. Thus the obvious reference to its past with the group singing of a fascist song Inno Dei Giovani Fascisti. Text of the song isPopol Di Destra Che Forte Adempie E Rompe Con Ali E Fiamme La Giovinezza Va. Fiaccole Ardenti Sull'Are Sulle Tombe Noi Siamo Le Speranze Della Nuova Et. Duce Duce Chi Non Sapr Morir? Il Giuramento Chi Mai Rinnegher? Nuda La Spada Quando Tu La Vuoi Gagliardetti Al Vento Tutti Verranno A Te Armi Bandiere Degli Antichi Eroi Per L'Italia O Duce Fa Balenare Al Sol Va La Vita Va Cos Ci Porta E Ci Promette L'Avvenir Una Vasta Giovent Con Romana Volont Combatter. Verr Quel D Verr Che La Gran Madre Degli Eroi Ci Chiamer Per Il Duce O Patria Per Il Re Noi Griderem Gloria E Impero D'Oltremar. And it is here that one of the most interesting storyline techniques is made with the wedding party singing the fascist song suddenly the storyline jumps forward to the future showing Daniela's father in a car riding back to Rome and commenting on the day's event with short clips of the past wedding party and fascist song singing then back to the future then back to the past. He makes the point that he knows these people well and that it is his responsibility to guide the Nation forward. So although of the evident rightwing background it is revealed that he is after all a politician with a conscience.A similar ploy of storyline and imagery injection is done with the clip of Caterina's father crying along with the crying of Gianfilippo tentative boyfriend.The only location that doesn't mesh well is the Monte Dei Cocci in Testaccio with a cross on top of a hill overlooking the city. The area is fenced trespassing not allowed and enforced. But then it is accurate again as only the grungy Margherita could think of going there since the area has traditionally been known for squatters gypsies and an alternative music school.BTW the choice of using the character of the Australian kid Edward is a good one. Being from such a far away land he is shown to be someone that can make an unspoiled and objective pointofview literally from his soapopera revealing bedroom window view. And from reading the blogs in Italy it seems that all the teenage girls in Italy are all in love with him.".

	schema:headline " Disarming Italian comedy with political undertones";
	schema:reviewBody "This excellent Italian comedy is very similar in plot to Mean Girls who came out in about the same time. The difference is that this is a much more politicized film. Caterina is a shy teenager from a small town in Italy who moves to Rome with her longsuffering mother and her teacher father when he is assigned to a new job there. In her new school she has to choose to what clique to belong the children of the progressive intellectuals or the children of the rich industrialists. The left or the right. What this film says is that these people are not terribly different between themselves. They both hold a degree of fame and power in Italian society and look down upon those who don't. The outstanding performance in the movie is that of Caterina's father the teacher Giancarlo Sergio Castellito a hothead angry that others have gotten all the breaks in life who rants against the rich and privileged but who would sell his soul in a second in order to join the establishment. He is a familiar type of malcontent in real life but one who is seldom shown in the movies. There is a silly subplot of Caterina falling in love with an Australian boy What they did that for? To reach an international market? but all in all this is one of the best Italian movies of the last years.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wish I could say that this was a great film because there really were a lot of things that one could like about it.As it turns out however it is a good but flawed film. I will give this film a recommendation I think it is worth seeing.The film made a number of incredible social statements. It really cuts to the quick about the nature of society the people who can manipulate the system on both sides are in collusion with each other to keep their privilege. The people who are on the outside find themselves on the outside looking in. They can be taken under someone's wing but they are never really more then a pet the Jimmy Olsen to someone's Superman.The film had spectacular acting particularly from the lead.So what then keeps the film from being great? One of the biggest problems comes from the episodic and picaresque structure of the film. It has the kind of structure that is more interesting because of its discontinuity then because of its continuity. And while it makes for a lot of interesting discussions this could turn a lot of people off probably even more then the subtitles.Honestly the problem is that it begins with Caterina being pulled in many directions and it allows us to see facets of her through these different social lenses. The trouble is that we never get a baseline reading on her in the beginning before she moves to Rome. This is done very well but we never get the impression of her as anything more then a tablet that the ideologies of others are being written on even at the end of the film when she supposedly finds herself. I won't give a spoiler as to how but the ending that someone else commented was her in her element is really just another case of this.You know what I've changed my mind. This is a wonderful film to watch. Its a spectacular way to look at what life is really like when you are outside the powerful and privileged circles of society and you can only be influenced by the ideologies of others but you really lack any voice of your own.Watch this along with Welcome to the Dollhouse and see what life was like for the rest of us. Let this film show you the social cliques collusion and ideology and let Solondz show you the sheer cruelty of a society that as J. G. Ballard said normalized psychopathy. And see it for what it really is not some sugarcoated network television version I think you guys know what very popular television series I'm talking about.".

	schema:reviewBody "Caterina gives us an opportunity to feel and a chance to hope. A young girl both naive and somehow mature she is unsure of what she wants in life. Her task is learning to navigate the waters of a high school in Rome where she is the new girl from the sticks when her father is transfered from a small town on the coast. He fulfills his dream of returning to the cultural mecca of the capital where he hopes to take his rightful place among the intelligentsia. But the film turns on just this pointrightful place. There are no simple answers though we do have an opportunity to see how complex it is to find one's place rightful or not in the world. Caterina is something of a metaphor for the Italian populace at large I would think. But she is more than this. There is something about her story that touched me several decades and half a world away from the world she inhabits a world stratified by cliques and patronage prejudice and injustice...a world very much like the one I live in and the one I imagine most of us live in. Caterinaas the film that bears her namedoes not take the easy way out in running away or selfrepression or living a life of quiet desperation even when her sheltered provincial upbringing and lessthanideal family situation do not give her any clues on how to deal with her new life and classmates from prominent families. She tries to adjust to the fastpace and superficiality of life in the Italian capital and much of the fun of the movie is seeing her in the various situations she encounters along the way. Her father is great as the frustrated writer with no talent and a loud voice a selfimportant boor. My heart goes out to all the Caterinas of the world who go forward with optimism and pure heart even when they know the odds are against them.".

I also liked the mom's character played by a really good and beautiful Margherita Buy in general I appreciated Virz's idea that the good part of society is based on the strength of women as all male characters in this movie either are donquixotesque losers or spoiled and arrogant overgrown babies.But as for most of his movies I think the same criticism again apply Virz is openly a leftwing director but he stresses this a bit too much and sometimes its works sound too ideological art should make you think not tell you what to think I guess. In addiction some characters are too stereotypical and don't come out of a really deep psychological analysis.

	schema:reviewBody "'Caterina va in citta' 'Caterina in the Big City' is an Italian film that takes as its storyline the coming of age of a young teenager transported by her family from the quiet Tuscany seaside village of Montaldo Di Castro to the challenging realities of Big City Rome but that is only the means to an end of exploring Italian politicosocial life and its effects on the youth of today. It comes very close to drowning in its own excesses but at the root of the film is a sensitive tale of a young girl's struggles with growing into an adulthood that puzzles frightens and challenges her.Caterina Alice Teghil finds her greatest moments of happiness in her home town singing mezzo soprano in the choir simple pleasures in a simple setting surrounded by country folk content to live life day to day. Her father Giancarlo Sergio Castellitto is a teacher who can't hold a job partially because he is so outspoken and partially because he is a raving truly obnoxious person. Her mother Agata Margherita Buy is subservient a woman with few coping mechanisms who allows her odious husband to run an abusive household. Giancarlo's aunt is ill in Rome and with the idea of finding a job where his talents are respected Giancarlo uproots his little family and moves to the big city. There the social castes are evident and Caterina is judged a country hick until she is befriended by first a rebel who bonds with Caterina introduces her to tattoos and liquor and causes a schism between her important mother Giancarlo hoped to have is novel published by the woman the daughter and his family. Caterina then is absorbed into the rich and spoiled rank and file of the wealthy not fitting in until the girls do a make over. That situation is again disrupted by Giancarlo's blindly inappropriate behavior. The true Caterina is somehow lost still dreaming of becoming a fine mezzo soprano but tagging along with the crowd du jour. Ultimately Giancarlo's multiple and consistent failures drive him away from the family he rides off to oblivion on his restored motorbike and Agata and Caterina both bloom.The noise level of this film is such that it is difficult to watch the young girls means of communication is a mixture of screaming loud talking and fighting and otherwise making us uncomfortable. Yet underneath all of the political and social expose and brandishing is a truly wonderful young Caterina whose life as a soap opera is watched tenderly by an Australian boy who plays the guitar and observes her family from a window across the way from Caterina's Rome home. The moments toward the end of the film when the playback comes justifies the fuss of getting there.This is not a film this viewer would sit through again but reflecting on the story after all the commotion is over hearing Mozart's 'Ave Verum Corpus' and Verdi's 'Nabucco etc as the inspiration behind Caterina's honest dreams makes is a more memorable experience. In Italian with English subtitles. Grady Harp".

I feel for Caterina because I guess I am a little naive in a way. She didn't realize that people were using her she didn't realize that Margherita liked her in a different more romantic way she didn't know about a lot that went on in Rome. It was a very nice dramatic and funny storyline and i suppose it appeals to a large audience. I rated it 910. I took off 1 mark because I feel not enough was shown of Edward the guy she loved the guy from down under the guy who most Australians can identify with. He played a prime role in my eyes because he brought her life back on track when she had run away. A little more could have also been shown of Fabietto and Agata's relationship. This film was an excellent representation of the comparison between the posh side of Italy and the grateful and appreciative side of Italy".

I feel for Caterina because I guess I am a little naive in a way. She didn't realize that people were using her she didn't realize that Margherita liked her in a different more romantic way she didn't know about a lot that went on in Rome. It was a very nice dramatic and funny storyline and i suppose it appeals to a large audience. I rated it 910. I took off 1 mark because I feel not enough was shown of Edward the guy she loved the guy from down under the guy who most Australians can identify with. He played a prime role in my eyes because he brought her life back on track when she had run away. A little more could have also been shown of Fabietto and Agata's relationship. This film was an excellent representation of the comparison between the posh side of Italy and the grateful and appreciative side of Italy";

CATERINA is perhaps too ambitious for its own good. Though the film balances the various story lines and themes fairly well you can't help but feel that it would have been stronger as drama if it were more focused. Still CATERINA gives us a glimpse of the social turbulence that is going on in modern day Italy can one even imagine such a toxic stew in an American Teen Film? Can you picture Hillary Duff going to a Communist rally and NOT have it be done as a joke or a farce!?.And what would normally be the big dramatic climax in the story towards the end is treated as just another bump on the road in Caterina's life. In fact Caterina just shrugs and hopes that the person is doing fine where they are. No big tantrums or ruined lives. How refreshing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw 'Caterina va in Citt' in Sydney where the audience had mixed reactions to the schoolboy who speaks Italian with what's apparently meant to be a Sydneysider accent. In general I was impressed by the ensemble acting but I felt that the best performance was given by Margherita Buy as the heroine's mother Agata. I was disappointed that Agata has so little to do with the main plot of the film.The symbolism is just a trifle heavyhanded in this movie. Remember those Hollywood war movies from World War Two in which the bomber crew conveniently had one member of every white ethnic group? And there was usually one rich guy and one guy from the slums. Well directorcoscriptwriter Paolo Virzi has got that gimmick here Italian style. When 15yearold Caterina's parents move house from a Tuscan seaside town to Rome and enrol her in a bigcity school the student body conveniently includes the full spectrum of Italy's national archetypes. For example Daniela is wealthy beautiful and popular the daughter of an official in the rightwing government. Margherita is a leftwing 'revolutionary' the daughter of a famous intellectual. Of course the film implies that Margherita is somehow better and more 'authentic' than Daniela.Because I found the political subplots of this movie to be deeply clichd  especially since Italy is in no position to lecture any other nation on the subject of politics  I was pleased that the film's political content stays firmly secondary. The main story of this movie is rightly Caterina's uneasy and awkward progress through adolescence and into adulthood. It's no surprise to discover that being a teenage girl in modern Italy is difficult but surely every adolescent  male female rich poor in any century or culture  has found adolescence to be a difficult time of transition. Except for some of its political comments I found this to be a very honest and intelligent film with characters I really cared about. I'll rate 'Caterina va in Citt' 8 out of 10 and I look forward to more films from Paolo Virzi. Brava Caterina!".

In American teen films the parents are normally reduced to simple shadows that serve more as a background for their sons and daughters' lives  they are either of the preachingrepressive sort or the tolerant everforgiving parents that eventually through love will help their children to the way of redemption.Not so Caterina va in citt. In this film not just Caterina  Alice Teghil but her parents as well are portrayed as threedimensional human beings and this makes the film more interesting.Caterina and her parents move from a small Italian town to Rome. And there Caterina's life will be shaken. She goes to high school and meets new friends  many new things happen in her life. She feels uprooted from her old self and doesn't know anymore who she really is. One can say that Caterina va in citt is a coming of age film  it portrays her search for her place in the world  many American teen films tell the same story. But what differentiates this film from its American counterparts is the attention it gives to the parents. The father Giancarlo Sergio Castellito is a deeply disturbed personality. He thinks the world revolves around him and there's a conspiracy of important segments of society whose main aim is preventing him from succeeding in life. He is an egoist that treats his wife as a dumb servant and his daughter as a beautiful puppy. But no he's not a bad man  in his own distorted way he loves his wife and his daughter. Sergio Castellito gives us a stellar interpretation as the problematic father underlining his pathetic and quixotic traits. Agata Margherita Buy is his everenduring wife  she has a deeper layer than it may appear at first glance. And there's Caterina living with them seeing them with her innocent eyes. The other characters in the film are what one could call walking clichs. Nothing that has not been shown before in American teen movies. Politics shows its colors in the film but in a very superficial way. It's not really essential for the film's story  left and right could have been easily substituted for rival football teams.The ending difficult to imagine in American films will come as a surprise and have a liberating effect on the viewer. All in all Caterina va in citt is a good teen film thats stands a bit above the usual film of the genre.".

A timeless 'Coming of Age' tale is portrayed with truth and style although the specifics of contemporary Italian politics lose a bit in translation even a viewer who is ignorant of European politics is not left in the dark. Caterina played by Alice Teghil is a junior high school aged student who relocates to Rome with her family. Her father is a frustrated teacher who feels that his career has been sidetracked in the sleepy coastal town of Monalto and looks forward to the possibility of social and intellectual advancement in the big city. Soon he runs up against the stratified nature of Italian society and Caterina encounters the same setup but within her school system. From her first day in class she meets classmates who toss around political jeremiads which they don't really comprehend but are very emotionally attached. Although by the end of the school year Caterina is moved and changed by her experiences she seems to understand that these emotionally charged names and categories never tell the whole story and really amount to passionate clichs. Paolo Virz the director is known in Italy for his ability to examine the entrenched nature of Italian politics with humor and insight. CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY an intelligent look at what it is like to live in a stratified society and to strive to locate your unique and proper place.".

Soon he runs up against the stratified nature of Italian society and Caterina encounters the same setup but within her school system. From her first day in class she meets classmates who toss around political jeremiads which they don't really comprehend but are very emotionally attached. Although by the end of the school year Caterina is moved and changed by her experiences she seems to understand that these emotionally charged names and categories never tell the whole story and really amount to passionate clichs. Paolo Virz the director is known in Italy for his ability to examine the entrenched nature of Italian politics with humor and insight. CATERINA IN THE BIG CITY an intelligent look at what it is like to live in a stratified society and to strive to locate your unique and proper place.";

	schema:reviewBody "My reaction to viewing this film is one that suggests that a missed opportunity took place because what could have been a potentially fascinating film instead turned out to be something that quickly loses steam. Story is about 12 year old Caterina Iocovoni Alice Teghil who moves from the small town of Montaldo Di Castro to Rome where her father Giancarlo Sergio Castellitto grew up. Giancarlo is a frustrated accounting teacher who hates his job and dreams of being a writer but perceives that his lack of success comes from society itself.SPOILER ALERT Once Caterina enters school she discovers that her class is divided into two main cliques with one side being the radical left intellectual socialists while the other side is the spoiled reactionary industrialist fascists. Caterina first becomes friends with Margherita Carolina Iaquaniello who usually buries herself in her bedroom and lights incense but when she shows herself to be too passionate about affairs it forces Caterina to keep her distance. She then becomes friendly with the incredibly rich and spoiled Daniela Federica Sbrenna who's father is an important politician but she proves to be shallow and inconsiderate and it leaves Caterina out of both loops. Meanwhile Giancarlo tries to use all of his daughters friends in an attempt to get their parents to read his unpublished novel but while he's busy embarrassing himself his wife Agata Margherita Buy is having an affair with an old friend.This is directed by Paolo Virzi and the general premise of his film is pretty interesting with young Caterina discovering the cultural schisms of Italian society but I felt that what Virzi wanted to say was said about halfway through with the remainder of his film becoming labored. The performances are solid with Teghil showing enough wide eyed innocence to make her character believable but the film also gives Castellitto another opportunity to prove that's he's one of Europe's finest character actors. Along with the script dragging towards the end I also had a sense that the film has a strong disdain for Rome itself and wanted to show that true happiness is found only in small communities which isn't a bad perspective but I had a feeling that this was used just as an excuse for the characters actions. I certainly didn't dislike this film and it does take an admirable stab at something that's culturally significant are you listening Hollywood? but the film as a whole makes it's point early enough and than ultimately becomes tiresome going down the stretch.".

After much toing and froing Marie agrees to do it and gets pregnant.  However when Sophie dies Marie is left alone and changes her mind and goes looking for help.Marie's dream is of family and a nice home a dream that seems far off with her wild lifestyle of going from port to port with her friend Sophie working the boats for enough money to hold them until the next job.  This film appears to lack focus because it makes you think it will be an emotionally story focused on the baby whereas really Marie is the focus and her baby is only one of the things that happen to her.  In this regard the film does tend to wander replacing emotional events with actual ones meaning that the film feels like it is just going somewhere for the sake of going somewhere.  It still has emotional involvement because Marie is a good focus but her life events over 9 months just seem too far fetched and unlikely in comparison to the story I expected from the first 20 minutes.A big reason it works is the performance of Hjejle she has a very difficult character and while she doesn't manage to make it totally real she does enough to engage the audience in her story.  Henderson is OK but has a strange character that the script just moves around as it required.  The support cast of Scottish actors are quite enjoyable including faces such as the everpresent Cosmo as well as Gary Lewis and McBurney.  Gallagher does reasonably well but is secondary to the film in terms of focus also she doesn't have enough to work with to really distinguish her from some of her other rough Irish lass' performances.Overall this is an interesting film thanks mostly to a performance by Hjejle that holds the material together better than it deserves.  It doesn't have a great heart to it and wanders too far at times in terms of events but it is still worth seeing despite never really being totally convincing.".

	schema:headline " Rivals DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE as Germi's best film";
	schema:reviewBody "The early Germi films though they take place in Italy are mostly pastiches of American genre films. IN THE NAME OF THE LAW 1948 borrows from a host of American westerns about sheriffs who against all odds and without much help from the townspeople clean up the town and expose the complicity between a prominent town father and the outlaws. THE WAY OF HOPE 1950 is much like THE GRAPES OF WRATH depicting the trek of a group of dispossessed workers following an evanescent lead for work in another land. There's even a scene where they get work on a farm and are called scabs by striking workers very similar to Ford's film. THE BRIGAND OF TACCA DI LUPO 1952 is similar to Ford's FORT APACHE the martinet who insists that men on field campaign for three years adhere to strict protocol who doesn't know the difference between a good Indian and a bad one and who insists on leading his men into danger against all the advice of seasoned professionals. FOUR WAYS OUT 1952 is much like THE ASPHALT JUNGLE in plot and tone. All of these films are impeccably made beautifully photographed and acted with no false notes and with neorealist overtones three were cowritten by Fellini. However they're all a bit slow a bit too derivative and they all generate more respect than enthusiasm.THE FACTS OF MURDER is something else entirely It is another genre film borrowing from many police procedurals yet here one feels that Germi has finally graduated from respectful pastiches to create a work that is completely successful on its own. The plot about a robbery in one apartment and a murder in an apartment across the hall a week later is so complex that it's hard to follow at times in some ways it's similar to the complex Chandler novels and with a similar denouement but it's richly detailed with many interesting characters. Germi is a superb actor and his handling of other actors is sure. The interplay between the three detectives is sophisticated and clever and has the ring of actuality. The pace is fast but not rushed and the writing and the pictorialization are richly nuanced. Above all it is a highly entertaining film!This is the film where Germi seems to have come into his own as a master filmmaker where he still has some the neorealist characters and story structure from his earlier period but also has the biting humor and social satire of his later films. It rivals DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE as his best film and is a must see.".

	onyx:emotionText "The early Germi films though they take place in Italy are mostly pastiches of American genre films. IN THE NAME OF THE LAW 1948 borrows from a host of American westerns about sheriffs who against all odds and without much help from the townspeople clean up the town and expose the complicity between a prominent town father and the outlaws. THE WAY OF HOPE 1950 is much like THE GRAPES OF WRATH depicting the trek of a group of dispossessed workers following an evanescent lead for work in another land. There's even a scene where they get work on a farm and are called scabs by striking workers very similar to Ford's film. THE BRIGAND OF TACCA DI LUPO 1952 is similar to Ford's FORT APACHE the martinet who insists that men on field campaign for three years adhere to strict protocol who doesn't know the difference between a good Indian and a bad one and who insists on leading his men into danger against all the advice of seasoned professionals. FOUR WAYS OUT 1952 is much like THE ASPHALT JUNGLE in plot and tone. All of these films are impeccably made beautifully photographed and acted with no false notes and with neorealist overtones three were cowritten by Fellini. However they're all a bit slow a bit too derivative and they all generate more respect than enthusiasm.THE FACTS OF MURDER is something else entirely It is another genre film borrowing from many police procedurals yet here one feels that Germi has finally graduated from respectful pastiches to create a work that is completely successful on its own.

To my surprise it began 15 minutes ahead of schedule but the book helped me to fill in the gap. There was not much to say on TV after the surprising defeat of the government so they ran the film well ahead of schedule.

Passion envy trust betrayal and forgiveness are all brilliantly encompassed in the relationship between Musset and Sand.I enoyed this movie though some may find it dull and slow.  You may need to be a diehard romantic or like wellcostumed period dramas to watch this movie.  My harshest criticism for this film would be that of it's length and even though I enjoyed the turbulent relationship shown in this film there were times when I thought that their affair had ended for good only for them to reconcile a few scenes later.This movie is handsomely photographed with wonderful costumes by Christian LaCroix and most magnificent of all the actors don't seem like they're acting at all.  Juliette Binoche is spectacular both beauitful and natural in her potrayal of Sand.  Benoit Magimel is splendid as Alfred Musset.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a great admirer of George Sand's works so I was curious about this film and have been ever since I heard that it came out in France in 1999. I finally got a chance to see it two weeks ago in New York. Diane Kurys' film is wellacted and beautifully shot.  Unfortunately viewers won't be much enlightened about Sand or Musset as writers by watching it.  Nor is it a convincing love story.  Both of these faults are mostly due to a mediocre script.The basic outline of the facts of Sand's relationship with Musset are there but any sense of why they had such a fatal obsession with each other is lacking. Lots of inane dialogue about love isn't enough!  The two are barely together before they're fighting and Musset is such an unpleasant selfish manipulative and immature fellow a characterization that's apparently pretty true to the facts that Sand's devotion to him is hard to fathom. Surprisingly from a filmmaker with a feminist slant you learn very little about Sand's beliefs as a woman or an artist.  She seems like a sane person though and a hardworking writer and that is historically accurate but there's no depth in spite of all that the lovely talented Juliet Binoche can do.  The character as written simply isn't interesting and that's sad because the real life George Sand was a fascinating woman. The film's portrait of the Romantic era and its writers isn't much better. Yes I suppose with all the bad behavior and opiumgulping Musset and some others were like the childish spoiled rock stars of today which may have been the filmmaker's point but there's no sense of what their work was like.  When Sand and Musset talk about their writing and its meaning they sound like rank amateurs.  The one thing you learn about Sand's novel Lelia from the film is that it was about female frigidity and how few men are capable of arousing a woman.  Naturally Musset soon cures Sand of her frigidity. Hooboy.  In reality Lelia is a complex attempt to address many philosophical issues of the age and a struggle to find the meaning of existence with or without God but that doesn't make good cinema I guess. It's easier to suppose that women are always going to write about sex rather than to admit that they have any ideas of their own. If you want real insight you'd be far better off reading Sand's works something like her most magnificent short story The Marquise for starters.  Or how about calling a moratorium on films about Sand's love life and actually bringing one of her works to the screen?  That would be a real tribute.".

They really got the period represented well and the cinematography is lovely. The problem then is I doubt if this movie should have been made in the first place. I found BOTH reallife characters to be among the most annoying and pointless characters I have ever watched. It's hard to care about people when they are like Mussetselfish boorish and showing all the signs of a Borderline Personality Disorder. And likewise it's hard to care about a woman so fundamentally screwed up that she MUST have this worthless jerk in her life! Now that I think about it it's like taking a couple who are featured on the Jerry Springer Show giving them gobs of money and sending them back to the 1830s to live. It's just really hard to care about spoiled rich idiots. Stop whining about your livesyou pampered foolsget real jobs and stop spending your life in search of hookers and drugsor trying to win back this guy who seems to be trying to win the pimp of the year award! Frankly after the movie was over I just wanted them all to go to !! Next time spend the time and effort and talent involved on doing a biography on someone who is interesting and not grating like these two knuckleheads. Their literature may be great though after seeing this film I'll never try reading it but as human beings they were both sadly lacking.PSAlthough in the movie Alfred de Musset and George Sand broke up when it appeared to be around 1834 and he seemed to die unknown to the French public a year or so later or at least a short time later he did not die until about 20 years later and had been pretty prolific with his writing after their breakup. So much for presenting the story faithfully.PPSDon't let your kids see this boring movie as it is very graphic. Alfred de Musset goes from brothel to brothel boinking everything that breathes. Gee I could sure see why Sand wanted him for a lover!PPPS wowDon't feel too sorry for Sand. Despite the rather monogamous image we see in the film she had a long string of affairs with very famous men. By the time the real Musset died she'd slept with more than her share of men and some say women as wellbut that's open to speculation.".

Very interesting that most girls under 18 gave this a 1 rating as did I a 63 year old man. All other ages  sexes seemed to rate this film between 5 and 10 on average. I think many adults must be bullied by the literary subject matter and give the film an undeserved pass. Or are girls just more honest? I don't know about that but Diane Kurys has inflicted this endlessly obsessive film on us as much as de Musset inflicts his repetitive cruelties on Sand.

Very interesting that most girls under 18 gave this a 1 rating as did I a 63 year old man. All other ages  sexes seemed to rate this film between 5 and 10 on average. I think many adults must be bullied by the literary subject matter and give the film an undeserved pass. Or are girls just more honest? I don't know about that but Diane Kurys has inflicted this endlessly obsessive film on us as much as de Musset inflicts his repetitive cruelties on Sand. I simply got tired of watching the horrible dance and pushed the eject button well before the movie's end.

Early on Billy Parker Dylan is asked why he is in town and answers with telling a story about how his parents met then he says why he is in town.  Or this piece of dialogueDylan  When was the last time you wrote a song?Everett  2 years.Dylan  And the last time you toured?Everett  A year and a half.PauseDylan  Got any Johnny Cash albums?Everett  A few.Dylan and Everett  Uncontrollable laughterWhat?  Huh?  So many bad lines so little writing space.And despite all this I enjoyed watching this film.  It's like that wrecked car on the road you've seen it before but have to watch it through.  I must say I enjoyed watching Dylan listening to the poor 80's music Timmy Cappello on drums and the various mullets Rupert's was inspiring.

Young girl is mentored by old timer young girl releases record of her own a mild success. James Colt flakes. They all go their separate ways. Dylan is a loser in love but his integrity and dignity remain intact.

Rupert Everett burst out of the closet some ten years later and Bob Dylan never appeared as Billy Parker the ramblin' bluesman every again. Actually I'm not sure he appeared on the silver screen ever again after that  the man is better behind a mic I think even he would agree.To conclude? Hearts of Fire is the absolute guilty pleasure watch it for the laughs the tears the hopes the dreams I for one will continue to scan the TV schedules in the hope of yet another cheesy viewing.

I am one of those who only bought the movie because of Bob. His songs are good his acting is OK. I think he is acting himself and not having to put any effort into it. I like the fact that he even agreed to do this movie being that Bob is supposed to be considered a recluse. There are a few funny moments and those are Memorex moments. LOL Bob does show a caring feeling at times and I believe it is from his heart. I like the part when Bob tells Fiona at the beginning that Rupert's music sucks. That was cute. Also when Bob puts the harmonica up to the bus driver's neck pretending he had a knife. That was cute. But only in the movies.... Only in the movies. This movie is DEFINITELY recommended for Dylan fans.".

Surely it couldn't be worse than say Masked and Anonymous or the saga of Renaldo and Clara? So I started to read some reviews and was surprised at how bad it's supposed to be. In the end I was reticent to even watch it. Well I did just watch it and for me I enjoyed it thoroughly.It's definitely not a cinematic masterpiece by any stretch. The draw card for me was seeing Dylan in an old movie. Wasn't expecting much expecting to fall asleep.It's difficult to say if a viewer has no interest in Dylan or Fiona what the reaction would be. This movie is nearly 30 years old. Dylan is usually no great actor in films. Here he seems to be acting as himself whoever he is with some iconic lines.It's definitely a much better movie than many critics portray it as. Better than a lot of the new crap I've suffered through.".

Dylan has held a place in my heart and record collection beginning with records then tapes then CDs now MP3 since his first album. And I enjoyed newcomer Fiona and was surprised she didn't have more of a career than she did.

It blends excitement humor  history  definitely from a British viewpoint  into an attractive package sure to entertain the viewer lucky enough to find it.Indian actor Sabu stars as the young Prince of Tokot who finds his life suddenly become very dangerous when he's forced to flee his usurping uncle and accept protection from the British Raj. Plummyvoiced Roger Livesey plays the Raj's stalwart envoy to Tokot who must find a way to stop the import of weapons to the evil new Khan Raymond Massey who is fomenting a rebellion. All three actors play their parts very well with Massey especially attacking his villainous role with gusto.Also in the cast are Valerie Hobson as Livesey's courageous wife David Tree as a junior officer and corpulent Francis L. Sullivan as the local Governor in Peshawar. Alfred Goddard appears unbilled as the hapless private Kelly.Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924 Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysore's stables when he was discovered by Korda's company and set before the cameras. His first four films ELEPHANT BOY1937 THE DRUM1938 THE THIEF OF BAGDAD1940 JUNGLE BOOK1942 were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films BLACK NARCISSUS 1947 being the one great exception. His final movie Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS 1964 was an improvement but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963 only 39 years of age.".

Very politically incorrect by today's standards the film is a good adventure yarn as well as a Korda tribute to the the rapidly vanishing British Empire.

The plot of 'The Drum' cribs heavily and at one point openly with an impudentlyinserted piece of dialogue listing the historical parallels that had been niggling at me! from reallife events especially in Afghanistan and as other stories before and since have been based on the same material this can result in a certain 'seenitallbefore' sensation. But the winning element in this film is the touch of humanity and humour which helps the characters to become more than cardboard templates from the drummerboy and his misfortunes to the wry jests of the newlyappointed British representative walking openeyed into a trap. Not to mention that after a spate of films with seemingly pointless titles I found it obscurely satisfying to encounter one where the eponymous instrument is actually significant both to the plot and its climax!The alwaysexcellent Sabu steals the film as ever in his role first as a selfpossessed princeling and then as a fugitive in exile from his throne the romantic leads while wellperformed are less memorable. The tension in the banquet scene is tangible and Raymond Massey as the usurper brings brains as well as menace to his role. The one element that rather shocked me  with the exception of the inadvertent glimpse of buttock that reveals exactly what Scotsmen do or don't wear under their kilts!  was the scene in which the said usurper is shot down by our wounded hero in cold blood having thrown down his weapon. It's not customary for such an act to be depicted in an apparently approving manner and certainly not in a film of this period...I must admit that the question of the period itself had me slightly puzzled although the mention of syncopation in the drum part for the dance should have given me a clue. I had automatically assumed the story to be set in nineteenthcentury India in the heyday of the Raj rather than the contemporary world and with few European civilian fashions on display there was nothing to disabuse me of this until the heroine made an appearance in jodhpurs which came as something of a shock! And the subconscious resonance with the valleys of 'Carry On up the Khyber' turns out to be based in fact locations from both were shot in Wales...But 'The Drum' is a rousing adventure as they used to make 'em in the tradition of 'Charge of the Light Brigade' or 'Northwest Frontier' if you like the genre this one is a cracker.".

Despite being politically incorrect with the British superiority over the people of India the film does contain a fair amount of action and thrills to entertain the film going audience granted it is no Gunga Din or Four Feathers the latter of which and this film share the same author.

The beturbaned Indian natives the beskirted English soldiers the high mountain passes all in rich Technicolor along with the rich pageantry of masses of people moving here and there. And shouldn't forget the crackling if somewhat clichd storyline along with a charmingly youthful Sabu a gloweringly sinister Raymond Massey and a slim longlimbed Valerie Hobson. Then there's that thundering drum along with slinky native girls and twirling British Highlanders. The Korda's certainly spared no expense and it shows from spirited opening to satisfying close. Sure the subtext amounts to British colonial propaganda that no longer wears well. Still the lavish spectacle remains a treat for the eye. Of course I've changed in many ways from those earlier days but the Korda production can still entertain and impress if given half a chance.".

This view ignores that when the film was first screened in India in the late 30's it sparked riots among the populace.  However the statement is true as well as being null and void for there is zero danger of this film ever being made now!  The plot is very proEmpire and it is brazenly flag waving for the British. Looking back now the film is laughable in it's depiction of it's characters.  The British are kind and loving to all the Indians they encounter while the Indians love them in return those that don't are of course shifty and untrustworthy.This is rather insulting if you think about it too much  I must admit I wasn't offended but then I am neither English or Indian and know little of the history that is clearly being twisted here in favour of propaganda. The film does have a nice vein of good humour to it though that prevents it being too heavy while the battle scenes are of the up'n'over' school of filming.  The plot itself is too simplistic and can't keep the charade up  especially now that it will be clear to most viewers that it isn't a fair telling.The cast are good but again there's no way that an Indian' film would be shot today in Wales with the majority of the cast in blackface!  The standout actor is Sabu.  True his character is a little too good to be true but he has cheeky attitude and he is good fun throughout  just a shame his character seem to vanish for about a quarter of the film.  The villainous Massey is also good fun and I enjoyed his performance.  The British namely Livesey and Hobson are very stiff although they do get the more heroic roles towards the end.Overall this film is worth seeing as we will hopefully not see quite it's like again.  The film is unPC in casting script plot and characters while the history it claims to tell is nothing more than a flag waving exercise that rightly started angry riots in Indian when it was shown there. However it is worth seeing for the period the glorious for the time Technicolor and an amusing and fun performance from Sabu.".

To escape the same fate as his father Prince Azim Sabu assumes the identity of a lowly peasant as he tries to warn Captain Carruthers Roger Livesey of the danger that awaits him and his men.The Drum is one of those old school British films that glorified our former position as Empire builders by painting us as benign masters deeply concerned about the wellbeing of those whom we had colonised. The redoubtable Roger Livesey is the embodiment of stiff upper lippery as he strives to foil the skulduggery of the evil Ghul  a wonderfully malign performance from a blackfaced Raymond Massey  and return Azim to his rightful place on the throne of Tokot. Livesey wasn't really wellsuited to the dashing hero type although he was the epitome of the British colonial officer. Although he was only in his midthirties when he made this film he looks much older as if he'd be more at home over a fat cigar and a glass of port in the study than battling fuzzywuzzies in the searing heat. Valerie Hobson plays his devoted wife with that glacial air reserved for the wives of officers or upperclass businessmen in preWWII Brit flicks and it's impossible to imagine her locked in a passionate embrace with her husband. In fact that is probably where the biggest problem with this film lies there's very little passion for anything evident in any of the characters they are simply facing  or creating  one problem after another and stoically devising ways of dealing with them.The plot is fairly stodgy by today's standards. There's a lot of talk and precious little action until the last reel or two which means many people will find it hard going. Suffice to say the equilibrium is restored by the final reel and our Colonial subjects are left to live peaceful lives beneath our benign and everwatchful gaze.".

It's set in a more modern time between the two World Wars era of the British Raj. Seen today it is quite an anachronism.Not everyone in India bought Mahatma Gandhi's policy of peaceful nonresistance to British rule. Some like Raymond Massey playing a usurping uncle like Richard III believed in war. Trouble is he's only an uncle brother to the ruler of his local satrapy and uncle to the Crown Prince played by Sabu. In fact Massey has been plotting for years quietly importing arms and lining up support. He kills his brother but unfortunately doesn't get Sabu who seeks refuge with the British governor general Francis L. Sullivan. It's the next step for Massey that he hopes will rally the native Indians to his side. He has plans to massacre a troop of British soldiers Scot's Highlanders to be precise and among the folks there are Sabu's friends Roger Livey and wife Valerie Hobson and a drummer boy Desmond Tester whom he's befriended. What happens here is a slam bang action scene very well staged by Alexander Korda and brother director Zoltan Korda.These two Hungarians who were the backbone of the British cinema never missed an opportunity cinematically to salute the virtues of the British Empire. In some quarters Massey might be considered a hero in what he's doing.In fact the British never outrightly ruled India with the troops they had there. What they did is play off the various religious factions Hindu Moslem Parsee Sikh Jain etc. and the various rulers of the hundreds of little kingdoms that were within India after the last Mogul Emperor died. Military advice and supplies and trade did the trick for them for a couple of hundred years. What you see in Sabu's relationship with the British is quite true and you can see that in many other films like The Rains Came which was made in the USA.This was an expensive product for the British cinema. In the Thirties color was even more rarely used than in the USA yet the Kordas sprung for it. And they did a remarkable job in making location shooting in Wales look like India. The print I saw could have used a restoration and hopefully it has been done or will be done.Drums is anachronistic for today's audience both in India and in the west. But it is history if slanted Kipling like history.".

In the Thirties color was even more rarely used than in the USA yet the Kordas sprung for it. And they did a remarkable job in making location shooting in Wales look like India. The print I saw could have used a restoration and hopefully it has been done or will be done.Drums is anachronistic for today's audience both in India and in the west. But it is history if slanted Kipling like history.";

	schema:reviewBody "'It is wrong to try to avoid the struggle against imperialism under the pretext that independence and Revolution are important but that peace is still more precious' Kim il Sung A spirited patriotic production imbued with an idyllic representation of the benevolence of British rule released at a time when the Empire faced the dual threats of increasing nationalist resistance and the rise of fascism. As part of the defence of British and imperial values the Korda brothers would produce a series of unashamedly propagandist features to highlight the merits of British colonialism. Ironically the director of many of these productions Zoltan Korda would often clash with his brother over such material given his own cherished liberal and socialist ideals. This film is based on a novel published just twelve months earlier by AEW Mason to whom the Korda brothers would return the following year for a film adaptation of his most famous story 'The Four Feathers'. The eponymous instrument in this production will augur the fall of imperial rule over the fictional principality of Tokot with the marking of the massacre of British troops invited to a banquet held supposedly in their honour by the local treacherous khan. Tokot is notionally set in an area of historical unrest on the northern borders of the 'Jewel of the Imperial Crown' and one of the film's biggest draws is the glorious Technicolor cinematography used to full effect in capturing the majestic landscape of the NorthWest Frontier  Snowdonia in reality. This film also marks the second appearance of Sabu and though written as a vehicle for this newly acquired teenage star and creating a wave of rave reviews in Hollywood his performance suffers slightly due to his lack of sufficient screen time. His being cast as the young prince has a real touch of irony in that prior to being discovered he had followed in his father's footsteps as the ward to the Royal elephant stables to a local maharajah. The plot has our young prince and true heir to the throne of Tokot forced to flee his lands and assume the identity of a mere beggar boy on the streets of the Raj after his uncle's usurping of his murdered father's title. In exile the impressionable teenager seeks to warn his father's benign and paternalistic British masters of the threat his uncle poses to their continued rule. The stoic Ronald Livesey in the role of Captain Carruthers though a consummate actor is far from convincing as a dashing action hero. Yet he is ably supported by the graceful and unflappable presence of his wife played competently by Valerie Hobson  qualities she herself would be required to display years later offscreen as the besieged partner of scandalridden politician John Profumo. Despite being penned by the creator of one of the hallmark yarns depicting imperial adventure 'The Four Feathers' the plot of this adapted production fails to move beyond first gear. Moreover this unashamed defence of Empire is reputed to have sparked nationalist riots in India. Yet despite its lack of political correctness the film remains a watchable and colourful spectacle due to the aforementioned photography the rousing action finale  where the movie's tagline of 'a cast of 3000' is no mere hyperbole  and above all to a wonderful performance as pantomimelike villain Prince Ghul by Raymond Massey.".

It has a huge budget by British standards lots of color and pageantry as well as a strong endorsement of the British colonial system. You are supposed to side with and root for the Britsbut in 2011 and in America I felt myself at times siding with the rebels. After all this was their country and the British were the occupying force. Colonialism the bulwark of many 1930s and 40s films is now out of fashion.The film is set in the kingdom of Tokot. I presumed this place was a fictional place someplace around the Muslim nations of Afghanistan or Pakistanbut the real Tokot is near Sudan in Africa. I assumed it was Asian because the people looked Asianand not the least bit Sudanese. Their leader is about to sign a treaty of friendship with the British. In other words he will remain in power.but be 'protected' by the British. However his people are against this treaty and his brother Raymond Massey is planning on using this as a way to seize power. However after the assassination the man's son Sabu escapes and a frantic search commences to kill the boy who is the rightful leader. However the main focus through all this really is the British armyand shows what is happening mostly through their perspective. In other words while Sabu was a huge star for Korda he really is more of a supporting character. So the main theme is the safety and health of these soldiers and whether or not they'll survive Massey's scheming.The Drum is a pretty good film but I couldn't help but feel that compared to Korda's other epics it's a bit bland and easy to skip. Now I am not saying you shouldit's a decent film. But I would recommend you download and watch his other films first. It's easyjust follow the links on IMDb.".

	schema:headline " Don't take it seriously and you might have some fun with it.";
	schema:reviewBody "Silly sometimes juvenile but generally amusing adaptation of the Edgar Wallace story by producer Harry Alan Towers using his screen writing pseudonym of Peter Welbeck. Fading sitcom star Robert Cummings plays Bob Mitchell a naive American playboy on vacation in Hong Kong. He soon gets dragged into various matters of international intrigue while a dedicated police commissioner Rupert Davies and his associate Roy Chiao work the case. The five golden dragons of the title are criminal masterminds who are due to meet each other in person for the first time.This is a moderately fun rather lightweight mystery. It's not a great one by any stretch of the imagination but it sometimes delivers some entertainment. It lessens its impact by going on too long and losing some momentum and it really does get too positively goofy for its own good. The falling death of a henchman is played for laughs for one thing. What helps matters a fair bit is the exotic setting. The movie is shot in Techniscope and Technicolor and looks absolutely gorgeous. And now that the word gorgeous has been brought up it must be said that the female cast looks ravishing Margaret Lee as the devilish singer Magda and Maria Rohm  Maria Perschy as a pair of sisters. The songs  score are catchy.The international cast of superstars gives it curiosity value. Cummings supplies both heroics and comedy relief and he's likable enough.

	onyx:emotionText "Silly sometimes juvenile but generally amusing adaptation of the Edgar Wallace story by producer Harry Alan Towers using his screen writing pseudonym of Peter Welbeck. Fading sitcom star Robert Cummings plays Bob Mitchell a naive American playboy on vacation in Hong Kong. He soon gets dragged into various matters of international intrigue while a dedicated police commissioner Rupert Davies and his associate Roy Chiao work the case. The five golden dragons of the title are criminal masterminds who are due to meet each other in person for the first time.This is a moderately fun rather lightweight mystery. It's not a great one by any stretch of the imagination but it sometimes delivers some entertainment. It lessens its impact by going on too long and losing some momentum and it really does get too positively goofy for its own good. The falling death of a henchman is played for laughs for one thing. What helps matters a fair bit is the exotic setting. The movie is shot in Techniscope and Technicolor and looks absolutely gorgeous. And now that the word gorgeous has been brought up it must be said that the female cast looks ravishing Margaret Lee as the devilish singer Magda and Maria Rohm  Maria Perschy as a pair of sisters. The songs  score are catchy.The international cast of superstars gives it curiosity value. Cummings supplies both heroics and comedy relief and he's likable enough. Davies and Chiao the two of them utter quotes from Shakespeare appropriate to various situations are excellent. Klaus Kinski is a hoot as always as the nefarious Gert but fans might bemoan not seeing him get to do more. Giving the film a shot in the arm late in the game are the special guest star appearances by Dan Duryea George Raft Brian Donlevy and Sir Christopher Lee who play four of the five golden dragons.

	schema:reviewBody "I've gone back and forth on how to rate Five Golden Dragons. On one hand I really want to like this movie. It's got an infectious 60s vibe that really worked with me. On the other hand it's got a lot of problems and is in all honesty a mess of a movie. So I'm stuck with giving it a wishywashy 510.I'm not going to do the normal plot summary. There's no point because there's not much of a coherent plot. None of it makes any sense at all. I'll just say that there is a lot of supersecret spy type stuff going on in Hong Kong and it all surrounds a group of five guys who call themselves the Five Golden Dragons hence the title. What they do or who they are is as unknown to me now as it was before I watched the movie. All I know is that they want to sellout to the mafia I think for 50 million. And there are some other people who would quite naturally like to get their hands on the money. Be warned that all or part of this could be completely wrong  I just don't know.One of the big draws of Five Golden Dragons is the cast. George Raft Dan Duryea Brian Donlevy and Christopher Lee are prominently listed in the credits. However their combined screen time is about 1015 minutes and all they do is sit around a table put on and take off some goofy looking gold dragon masks and spout some of the most inane dialogue I've ever heard. The whole thing looks like it might have been filmed in an hour. Their acting is also pretty funny. They all seem to go through a range of emotions ranging from bewilderment to confusion to amusement to impatience. It's obvious they realize how bad this thing really is.Most of the rest of the cast is however very enjoyable. I really enjoyed seeing Klaus Kinski Maria Perschy wow Maria Rohm Rupert Davies and Sieghardt Rupp. All are capable and do the best with what they have. But the highlight for me was Margaret Lee. Any movie with Margaret Lee is automatically better than it would have been without her. A lot of the movie is more than competently filmed with some very nice shots of Hong Kong. The chase scene through the harbor was especially nice. The movie's pacing is all over the place. In spots the action is great and the movie has a nice flow to it. But in others the film really drags. Finally after going through some of the good and bad I found in Five Golden Dragons I'm left with writing about the one thing that almost ruined the movie for me and keeps me from rating it at least a point higher. And that is Robert Cummings. He's so bad! I don't know when I've seen an actor irritate me like this. Part of the problem is that much of the time he seems to be acting like he's in another movie. The comedy he brings to the film is most often completely out of place. His reactions to most everything going on are usually the exact opposite of what you would expect. Also he's 100 wrong for the role. Here's the IMDb summary for the movie A naive young American playboy in Hong Kong finds himself caught up in the middle of an international crime. Young! Are you kidding me? At 57 Cummings isn't young by a long shot. And his bad dye job doesn't help. Some of his scenes with Maria Perschy and Margaret Lee are embarrassing. Also at 57 he's way too old play nave. His stammering stuttering schoolboy is laughable. Completely and utterly ridiculous! I'm willing to forgive a lot of the faults in Five Golden Dragons but Cummings isn't one of them.".

An endless stream of beefy Chinese thugs in matching Polo shirts chase him around Hong Kong but can't kill him but they do kill off one of the cast sleeping in his hotel bedroom while he's on the couch snoozing. The rest of the cast in small roles is a Who's Who of movie legends wellknown faces and international actors. Bob was lucky not to have any scenes directly opposite mad man Klaus Kinski unusually subdued here. It has the same kind of funB movie timekilling ambiance as another Towers production Bang! Bang! You're Dead! Our Man in Marrakesh with Tony Randall who supposedly turned down the Cummings role. Towers had a yen for these Sax RohmerEdgar Wallacestyle films in the 1960s ultimately producing and writing over 100 films during his lifetime adding production value with exotic locations like Beirut and Hong Kong. The editing of the night club performances by Lee and Yukari Ito is poor interrupting their singing for some meaningless cutaway and then back again to the singers.".

And the reasons why this happened remain obscure. The story is simple courtesans in Paris must eventually retire form their lives of becoming wealthy through pleasing men of the higher class and either they live out their lives in the luxuries of fluff or they must confront their aging and feel pangs of remorse as they end their lives alone without a man to bolster them. Lea de Lonval Michelle Pfeiffer has been longtime 'friends' with Madame Peloux Kathy Bates even to the point of nurturing Madame's son Chri Rupert Friend as he approaches manhood. Madame asks Lea to 'polish' Chri for other women and after what might have been a brief fling in Normandy the young Chri and the aging Lea fall into a six year relationship. But as Madame realizes she needs grandchildren she eventually finds a proper girl Edmee Felicity Jones for Chri to marry. The remainder of the story is how these two agedisparate characters adapt to the 'social rules' of La Belle Epoque suggesting that even under extraordinary circumstances the power of love is an issue that must be confronted. Despite the performances by Pfeiffer and Friend and even the miscast Bates the story feels somehow sterile. Perhaps it is the out of place use of a male narrator who gives the film an unnecessary feeling of being a documentary or the somewhat overused musical score of Alexandre Desplat or the emphasis on costumes that hardly add to the beauty of Pfeiffer as Lea that keep the production grounded. It is a pleasant enough film but hardly a memorable one. Grady Harp".

Indeed her beauty elegance and refinement are always there to remind her and us how difficult it is to come to terms with ageing mainly when beauty has been the very essence of your life.The plot is almost absent being the story more based on emotions moods sensations rather than facts and the movie in the end manages to capture the viewer thanks to its capability to render the emotional side through glances and through effective and intense framing of both characters and situations the last one is incisive almost paralyzing. Ironic and funny moments are not absent mainly when Cathy Bates playing the odd high spirited mother enters the scene but the overall tone is a melancholic one above all for the female public we cannot but sympathize with Lea's inner strength and at the same time feel moved by her deep suffering.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the delights of this film is the lushness and perfection of the sets and costumes of the Belle poque c. 18901914. The sets and costumes are so gorgeous they threaten to overwhelm the actors. Threaten but don't succeed. Michelle Pfeiffer is sensual and beautiful as the aging courtesan Leaa woman approaching a certain age as the narrator Stephen Frears informs us. Lea has known the love and admiration of the wealthiest men in Europe many of them titled. She has been wise to keep her heart out of her affairs. Then Fred Cheri the son of another courtesan Kathy Bates enters Lea's life and she finds herself caring for the aimless but charming young man more than she should.Kathy Bates is wonderful as Madame Peloux a former competitor of Lea'sa woman who if you squint hard and catch the portrait of a younger Peloux you can imagine having a gamine charm years before. Bates' acting moves effortlessly from laughing delightedly at smutty gossip to quickly assuming the pouting selfrighteous expression of a disapproving mama as she discusses her son. From former courtesan to bourgeois matron in the blink of an eye. Bates carries this quick switch act off several times in the movie and it's a pleasure to watch her skill at these rapid changes. The sets and costumes of Mme. Peloux heavy 2nd Empire furnishings stiff wired dressed with bustles are beautifully contrasted with Lea's lighter lookslender graceful light. The clothes each character wears and the styles of their respective homes gives some subtext to the story. Mme. Peloux a bit older than Lea had her taste formed in an era of overdone stuffy pretentiousness while Lea a bit younger has embraced the airy beauty of Art Nouveau. The stultifying life of aging and former courtesans is welldepictedunwelcome in respectable society they have to fall back on each other's company. Former competitors they still can't help sniping at one another. Lea as one of the youngest of the group moves like a sylph among the faded charms of her cohort. One amazing scene Among a bower of faded courtesans one of them a busty brassy redhead cuddles and squeals like a teenager as she introduces her lover a young man who's the son of one this woman's official lovers. As she overwhelms the rather weedy young man with her caresses the viewer can see Lea's discomfortseeing the loud redhead and her boy lover seems like seeing a grotesque mockery of herself and Cheri.Cheri the title character is played by Rupert Friend Prince Albert in The Young Victoria and Mr. Wickham in the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice. He's a young man who has only two responsibilities marry and manage the large amount of money his mother settles on him at his marriage. He's a young man without purpose but finds love with Lea. What starts as a lighthearted affair turns into a relationship both Cheri and Lea need more than they realized. Lea and Cheri's affair endsas does the wonderful era depicted in this gorgeous movie. The war ends Lea and Cheri's world. The 20th century starts with bleakness and hardness after the golden afternoon of La Belle poque. We are indebted to Collette and Stephen Frears for showing us the loveliness and even the artful decadence of that time and we are indebted to the talented cast for giving life to the demimonde halfworld of that era.".

In the past a glass of champagne has been offered and sometimes there are lucky seats with prizes under them.So perhaps no coffee yesterday was a forerunner of what was to come. The list of cons is sadly far greater than the prosCONS The relationship between Michelle Pfeiffers character and Rupert Friends character is I am sorry to say more like Aunty and nephew. There's a passion missing here. Are they out lunching or enjoying other pleasures? No it's all indoors and not very exciting to watch at all. Ms Pfeiffer has wonderful hair carries her age well 50 is not old has perhaps nice back assuming no body doubles. But for me neither she or her character are not warm enough or sensual enough. In fact the lady I sat next to a cinema had more ooh la la. And she was a paying customer like us! And on the plus side of 60. Rupert Friend as someone here alluded to was too Olivia Bloom like foppish almost gay if you like. His dark hair and pale skin gave him a very unhealthy allure.Set in pre WW1 Paris and France I was looking forward to a variety of old veteran cars only 3 in the whole show... perhaps the vehicle budget was limited.. surely there must be more veteran cars in France. The Edwardian style fashions I love but for these give me the Great Race 1965 style. Sadly there was no Mademsoielle Dubois here Natalie Wood to carry this off yet the period was the same.One of the problems with Cheri is it lacked oxygen location recreations of pre WW1 France any sense of movement timewise and romance on any level. In many ways the film was shot like a play. A few different sets mainly indoors but little of interest outdoors. Very tightly framed shots of gravel driveways in stately old homes... full stop.Regarding the other courtesans with the exception of Cheri's wifes mother these were not a very stunning lot. Kathy Bates as a courtesan? Surely no man would pay serious money for her pleasures unless the supply of other courtesans was very short. Clearly these 19th century 20th century gentlemen were either too free with their money or not fussy enough?Perhaps Stephen Frears should have stayed on his side of the English Channel. Mrs Henderson presents was quite enjoyable... it did have Judi Dench Bob Hoskins and the lovely Kelly Reilly.Cheri should clearly have been left to the French done with French actors and actresses in French with English subtitles. What we have here sadly is about as French as McDonalds and must surely be a lost opportunity. Very disappointing.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are several very good reasons to see Cheri directed by Stephen Frears and written by Christopher Hampton from the novel by Colette. It's a beautifully made costume drama shot in some wonderful locations. It's well scripted although it does wander off track and get a little rambling in the middleand it's moderately entertaining although probably only for a limited audience. But the best reason of all is to see some really interesting performances from an array of predominantly female actors.Michelle Pfeiffer makes a very welcome and long overdue return to center stage as Lea de Lonval a Belle Epoch ie turn of the 20th century courtesan in Paris. Lea is ready to retire from her profession the business of sex and takes up with the son of a fellow courtesan the beautiful languid Cheri meaning Darling not for money this time but for love. Pfeiffer is radiant in the part and watching her is a sheer pleasure.Cheri is played by Rupert Friend who keeps popping up on my radar as one of the more interesting and talented of the young male actors around. He seems to be taking his career slowly but carefully picking some interesting roles. I first spotted him in Pride and Prejudice as wicked Mr Wickham after which he was excellent in Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont opposite Joan Plowright. I thought at that time how much like Orlando Bloom he looks but luckily he is a far better actor and will I think ultimately have a longer shelf life.Also fabulous is Kathy Bates as Cheri's mother. It is her plan to marry him off to Edmee the young daughter of a fellow courtesan taking him away from his true love Lea his senior by many years that sets the scene for what will become a tragedy. The courtesans were hugely rich but lived lives of isolated splendor. Not accepted by polite society they turned to each other for social interaction a small intense and rather incestuous circle. Bates' Madam Peloux needs to marry Cheri off but has limited options. Edmee the daughter of another old rival is available. Both are an only child set to inherit large sums of money. Business takes precedence marriage is a joining of fortunes and love means nothing leaving everyone unhappy Edmee Cheri and Lea.Perhaps almost as interesting  or even more so  than this movie's story is the story of Colette herself. The novelist lived from 1873 to 1954 married three times had many lovers of both genders including her stepson played the music halls wrote an opera with Ravel ran a hospital during WW1 and helped her Jewish friends survive during WW2. She wrote some fifty novels including Gigi made into a play and an award winning musical and is often referred to as one of France's greatest writers.And I can't review this movie without saying how quite wonderful it is for once to see an older woman entangled with a sexy younger man and how rarely we get to see that on screen. Time and time again we see quite ridiculous age gaps between male stars and much much younger women. Here Pfeiffer and Friend make the opposite work perfectly. I appreciate that costume drama has a fairly limited audience and this movie is certainly not perfect but personally  I loved it!!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Chri' is a product of the great English team that created the brilliant Choderlos de Laclos adaptation 'Dangerous Liasons' 1988 Christopher Hampton the writer as prolific as he is adept at turning French texts into English movies or plays and Stephen Frears the director who brought us such greatness as to name a few 'The Queen' 'Dirty pretty Things' 'The Grifters' 'Prick Up Your Ears' and the novelistically rich bisexual story of Pakistanis and Cockneys in London 'My Beautiful Laundrette'. This new film moreover is graced by the presence of Michelle Pfeiffer in the central part of Colette's aging courtesan La de Lonval. Pfeiffer had the pivotal role of Madame de Tourvel in 'Dangerous Liaisons.' Again this is a movie where French people speak English but that worked in the audacious and sumptuous FrearsHampton 'Dangerous Liaisons' and it works again here.It's two decades later and Hampton Frears and Pfeiffer though they show no sign of waning gifts don't quite bring back the magic but still 'Chri' adapted from two 1920's short novels by Colette not as strong material as de Laclos' epistolary novel is nicely paced and gorgeous to look at and Michelle is a wondrously beautiful fiftyyearold and still a delicious actress. Rupert Friend as La's young beau Fred Peloux nicknamed Chri isn't too hard on the eyes either as the young man though he's a bit difficult to accept as a 19yearold at first then the study jumps forward to six years later. Friend is actually around 27 and for this role a decidedly decadentlooking 27 at that.But decadent is what the part calls for. Chri himself is the son of an extremely rich courtesan. Madame Peloux Kathy Bates in elaborate late 19thcentury garb playing broadly enough to be Lady Bracknell in 'The Importance of Being Earnest' has spoiled the boy rotten he is completely lazy and she turns him over to La for training. This he might have got except that they belie all but dime novel expectations and fall madly in love with each other and remain together for six years whereupon Chri suddenly decides to get married to Edme Felicity Jones the daughter of another courtesan who has done well off her lovers and from then on things get complicated. All through the six years of the relationship La so adores Chri she hasn't the detachment to train him and just lets him do what he wants.Art Nouveau curlicues swirl throughout this beautifully designed film and Pfeiffer's looks and costumes are marvels of new deco tastes the story runs from the end of the Belle poque to WWI. Relationships with several servants become important as they are chatted up and asked for advice which sometimes they are smart enough not to give. Urban gardens are absolutely lush in the nineteenthcentury manner and all the visuals manage to be impossibly rich without being too distracting. But it all begins and ends with the casting and though Bates' broadness might be obtrusive it isn't because her role is relatively small. Rupert Friend is wonderfully pale and sickly looking yet sexy. Chri is spoiled and a bit androgynous as indicated by his constant desire to wear La's pearl necklace which he says looks just as good on him.Chri soon tires of his wife who at eighteen seems indecently young to him. We know what's going to happen. The only flaw of this enjoyable adaptation is that it happens too fast and the emotional complications don't come across as powerfully as they might especially when we think of the ending of 'Dangerous Liaisons' and Glenn Close's devastating collapse in the theater. In his effort to fuse together the two Colette Chri novels Hampton and Frears rush through the latter stages of the story. They also have a bit of trouble with tone. Having started out in a light comic vein they aren't altogether able to modulate into the darker moods of emotional confusion disenchantment and fear of aging.The latter is the issue La faces all along. Michelle Pfeiffer's lovely but no longer young face photographed in complimentary lights and then somewhat more cruel ones in itself tells a rich story that compensates for shortcomings in this generally buoyant and entertaining adaptation.".

	schema:reviewBody "During their idle moments or romantic longing the filmmaker employs the flashback to show how both CheriRupert Friend and LeaMichelle Pfeiffer are never far from each other's minds. He's twentyfive she's fortynine old enough to be you know. A longtime friendrival of his mother Cheri knew the prostitute as Nunu before she became his lover. Relegated to the backstory by omitting any dramatization of their former roles as adult and child Cheri is complicit in its endorsement of this relationship although the nickname the boy coined for Lea does at least acknowledge the momentous threshold that the old associates embarked on when their relationship turned from maternal to physical. An arranged marriage orchestrated by Cheri's motherand Lea's onetime rival Mme. PelouxKathy Bates however ends their sixyear run and on the boy's wedding day the diegesis becomes a remembering one as each lover conjures up the other at their most beautiful. Even in the world of courtesans as in socalled polite society Oedipal relationships are thwarted by too many factors that love simply can't overcome. But since the film makes judicious use of the flashback the audience identifies with this impossible love. This adaptation of Colette's two semiautobiographical novels Cheri1920 and Le fin de Cheri1926 sutures itselfLea's flashbacks are always of Cheri as a man not a boy but the sutures aren't so foolproof that the love affair isn't up for a little critical scrutinization. The next time that Lea reminisces about Cheri her idyllic abstraction of romance becomes flawed by a preceding flashback of another crossgenerational couple whom she had met in Mme. Peloux's orchard. Described by her friendrival as the happy couple Lea is confronted by a grotesque mirror of her own relationship with Cheri. The happy couple's disparate gap in age borders on sexual perversity and projects a version of the original relationship that Lea had with Cheri during the boy's formative years. This motherson dynamic made discreet by Lea's ability to project a facade of timelessness forces the wellmaintained courtesan to reflect that her sex bomb years are finite and fastapproaching its expiration date. In her twofold flashback Cheri's bedroom eyes are staring back at not just his significant other but a mother figure as well to her dismay.A wife in name only EdmeeFelicity Jones understands Cheri the child of a whore as she is one too when the young girl concurs with his observance of retrospective hindsight that they were orphaned by their respective matriarchal libertines. With this admission Cheri overstates its impetus for the selfdescribed foundling's attraction towards Lea. But stripping Mme. Peloux's familial title so formally serves the specific function of recasting her in nonOedipal terms. Since the complex that Sigmund Freud developed can't work without triangulation can't work without the presence of a fatherwho could be any number of his mother's johns to signify the mother he wants to f. Dictated by heterogeneous rules that a subculture entails Mme. Peloux acts against the nature of a parent when she hands over her son to a woman of motherly proportions who can't be trusted to act in a platonic capacity. She does son in a vicarious sense where Lea can actualize all the physical fantasies that Peloux may harbor but resist pursuing due to the technicality of blood. Neither motherin her son's estimation nor lover she has no tangible role in Cheri's life. The felicitous manner in which she dispenses information about the newlyweds' conjugalityshe tauntingly remarks to Lea on the weather in Italy site of her lover's honeymoon seems derived from envy. Although the union was financially motivated it doesn't seem to be the basis of Mme. Peloux's campaign to humiliate Lea since no stern admonition against threatening the compounded wealth between the children of whores are never made. After six years of vicarious satiation by Lea's sexual exploits with her son through the vehicle of disparaging rhetoric she reminds the courtesan that she's aging and turns her son's lover back into a mother.

	onyx:emotionText "During their idle moments or romantic longing the filmmaker employs the flashback to show how both CheriRupert Friend and LeaMichelle Pfeiffer are never far from each other's minds. He's twentyfive she's fortynine old enough to be you know. A longtime friendrival of his mother Cheri knew the prostitute as Nunu before she became his lover. Relegated to the backstory by omitting any dramatization of their former roles as adult and child Cheri is complicit in its endorsement of this relationship although the nickname the boy coined for Lea does at least acknowledge the momentous threshold that the old associates embarked on when their relationship turned from maternal to physical. An arranged marriage orchestrated by Cheri's motherand Lea's onetime rival Mme. PelouxKathy Bates however ends their sixyear run and on the boy's wedding day the diegesis becomes a remembering one as each lover conjures up the other at their most beautiful. Even in the world of courtesans as in socalled polite society Oedipal relationships are thwarted by too many factors that love simply can't overcome. But since the film makes judicious use of the flashback the audience identifies with this impossible love. This adaptation of Colette's two semiautobiographical novels Cheri1920 and Le fin de Cheri1926 sutures itselfLea's flashbacks are always of Cheri as a man not a boy but the sutures aren't so foolproof that the love affair isn't up for a little critical scrutinization. The next time that Lea reminisces about Cheri her idyllic abstraction of romance becomes flawed by a preceding flashback of another crossgenerational couple whom she had met in Mme. Peloux's orchard. Described by her friendrival as the happy couple Lea is confronted by a grotesque mirror of her own relationship with Cheri. The happy couple's disparate gap in age borders on sexual perversity and projects a version of the original relationship that Lea had with Cheri during the boy's formative years. This motherson dynamic made discreet by Lea's ability to project a facade of timelessness forces the wellmaintained courtesan to reflect that her sex bomb years are finite and fastapproaching its expiration date. In her twofold flashback Cheri's bedroom eyes are staring back at not just his significant other but a mother figure as well to her dismay.A wife in name only EdmeeFelicity Jones understands Cheri the child of a whore as she is one too when the young girl concurs with his observance of retrospective hindsight that they were orphaned by their respective matriarchal libertines. With this admission Cheri overstates its impetus for the selfdescribed foundling's attraction towards Lea. But stripping Mme. Peloux's familial title so formally serves the specific function of recasting her in nonOedipal terms. Since the complex that Sigmund Freud developed can't work without triangulation can't work without the presence of a fatherwho could be any number of his mother's johns to signify the mother he wants to f. Dictated by heterogeneous rules that a subculture entails Mme. Peloux acts against the nature of a parent when she hands over her son to a woman of motherly proportions who can't be trusted to act in a platonic capacity. She does son in a vicarious sense where Lea can actualize all the physical fantasies that Peloux may harbor but resist pursuing due to the technicality of blood. Neither motherin her son's estimation nor lover she has no tangible role in Cheri's life. The felicitous manner in which she dispenses information about the newlyweds' conjugalityshe tauntingly remarks to Lea on the weather in Italy site of her lover's honeymoon seems derived from envy. Although the union was financially motivated it doesn't seem to be the basis of Mme. Peloux's campaign to humiliate Lea since no stern admonition against threatening the compounded wealth between the children of whores are never made. After six years of vicarious satiation by Lea's sexual exploits with her son through the vehicle of disparaging rhetoric she reminds the courtesan that she's aging and turns her son's lover back into a mother. Cheri knows it too. While Lea makes travel arrangements over the phone the young man observes her through a crack in the door. Unaware of being monitored the audience supplies their own flashback through Cheri's eyes recalling scenes in which the boy saw her Lea's colleagues in restaurants and opium dens. They looked old.";

The visual richness of this parfait of the Belle Epoch is breathtaking from the rich creamy art neuveau architecture to the gloriously realized costumes of the early 20th century. What they only indicated in Titanic of the same period costumes. Explodes in luxury and in a sense informs the eye to the scene at hand and seems less costume than authentic clothing. As Cinema Cheri succeeds as more than an adaptation of a Collette novel but becomes a world unto it's own. Here we are presented with some of our finest female performers at the top of their game. In short I am speaking of Michelle Pfeiffer and Kathy Bates. As former courtesan rivals who are now aging friends they come together to define the last part of their lives and the beginning of Bates' son's life in a remarkable way. Kathy Bates goes deep into the complexities of her mix of comedy and nuanced drama in the same way she did with Annie Wilkes. Not to say that the characters of Annie and Madame Peloux are anything alike. But Miss Bates takes this role to a superior level while all the while not letting you see her do her magic. She is just THERE! The scene where her face decays from a radioactively sunny laugh to reveal her true deepest disgust her spoiled soul is priceless. Then there is Michelle Pfeiffer as Lea de Lonval at fifty one she may be older that the literary Lea but she has never been more luminous or nearly goddess like. To look at her is to look upon a woman of a certain age that is ageless in her embrace of times changing hands upon her face. But there is more. This may be the pinnacle of her career the role of her lifetime. She is Lea in so many levels both within her acting and in a sense as an actress. She is stunning and brings forth the soul of a great character as only our finest actors can. But all of this would seem a delightful trifle a light story of an aging courtesan and her young lover if it were not for the narration that gives the film added depth and gravitas. I asked a friend today what he thought of the final outcome of the story. Of what the narrator reveals of what became of Cheri. He tossed it off lightly and said that it seemed an after thought. He could not have been more wrong. He missed the whole point of the film. The last lines of the film that tell us of the ultimate fate of Lea and Cheri are what give this film an emotional strength irony and ultimately heart wrenching tragedy. It is the final twist set into a stunning jewel of a film that is as captivating and spellbinding as Lea's mysterious emerald ring.".

There was a hint that Cheri's mother Kathy Bates who I always love wanted the affair to occur to keep Cheri out of trouble. That seemed a bit creepy. As for the romance there was no chemistry between Lea and Cheri and no character development for Cheri even though the movie was named for him. He remained sullen brooding immature and amazingly dull although I don't blame Rupert Friend for the performance. I think the script direction and editing were to blame if not the story itself. The love scenes were tasteful but not believable. The pair were together for six years but the relationship didn't seem to have love or even lust at its core just a boredom being filled with champagne and satin sheets. Michelle was the reason my rating was a 3 rather than a 1. She did a good job with what she had to work with and I was invested in her character. However the character was ultimately a disappointment. I think we were supposed to come away with an experience of a slice of French culture courtesans during La Belle Epoque but it didn't work. I was stunned to see a car pull up to a country house it seemed out of place. The director had no idea how to set the time and place properly. The overlong verbal narration at the beginning and end of the movie was not only annoying I hate being told what should be shown but it didn't tell us things helpful to the story. The voiceover at the end was particularly awful because Cheri's entire life's arc was given three sentences. If they had edited that out I may have been able to nudge my rating to a 5.".

And that's all there is folks as the film moves from a robust ramble about the various courtesans to a dreary hour of Twilightlike longing between this oldfashioned Harold and Maude. Director Steven Frears who has had a fair share of intriguing films and characters just lets the camera make love to Pfeiffer and Friend without fleshing out the characters to let is know what is so lovable to be longing for so long. Writer Christopher Hampton with Dangerous Liaisons and Atonement on his resume can't seem to muster a memorable line or develop his characters from flat clichs into round characters.I do concede that Kathy Bates delivering this line saved the film for the moment Don't you find that when the skin is a little less firm it holds perfume so much better? Said to Michelle Pfeiffer these lines give Bates bite of the year honors and a brief respite from spare meaningless dialogue.".

Some of the blame must be laid upon the director and producers who decided to make another one of those Americans playing nonAmericans please suspend your disbelief films. How is it possible to suspend the disbelief that Kathy Bates was ever a desirable courtesan much less French?! Much of the costuming hairstyles and makeup are periodwrong. The reuse of exterior settings particularly the recurring car arriving at the manor house scenes gives the film a cheapness.But the majority of the blame has to be assigned to Michelle Pfeiffer whose acting skills are seldom detectable here. Nearly every line is delivered as if she's reading a Barbara Courtland novel aloud to an audience in the next room. Her voice is flat and declamatory and she seldom shows any depth or subtlety. If she was reading for an audiobook this might be acceptable for a film it's an endless line of sour notes.Cheri mostly reads as softcore porn from the 1970s like one of the Emmanuelle series or perhaps David Hamilton's work. It aspires to be elegant but just looks posed. It tries to be sophisticated but never rises above soap opera. It attempts to give us a believable relationship but it's really just actors going through the motions. I didn't buy any of it for a second. And my Colettereading wife fared no better than I.".

	schema:reviewBody "A film that fails to ignite much interest. Not for the first time in recent memory Pfeiffer plays the older woman in love with a younger man in this case one much younger. Scorsese and Pfeiffer covered some of this same territory in The Age of Innocence and to much better effect. She is a courtesan he the son of another famous courtesan. He has led an indolent life spoiled throughout his entire existence. As a result he has grown to manhood completely divorced from any feelings for anyone. Instead he allows himself to be forced into a hastily arranged marriage by his ambitious mother to a young woman he neither loves nor cares for. He is indifferent to his wife and drifts back and forth between the two women.The script is pretty nondescript in places. Pfeiffer has a few decent lines and still radiates enough screen presence to carry some scenes and Bates matches her well. Most of the problems with this film are based on the male character Cheri Friend. He is left with too little too late for us to care about his fate. lnstead he allows himself to have his opinions formed for him by his mother and and Lea who also does much of what passes for thinking on his behalf as well. He is married off to a woman he doesn't love and then proceeds to drift between her and his lover without ever showing any real sense of commitment to either. Due to the limitations of the script and his character he comes across as only half formed and too many scenes end with him staring blankly into the camera looking quite vacuous and a penny for his thoughts would be an understatement of inflation. lt is not easy to know which audience this movie is aimed at. It is not quite glamorous enough to be mainstream nor is it memorable enough to be arthouse. As a result it meanders along without ever really being anything more than an exercise in self indulgence. That is a pity as l was expecting a fair bit more from those involved.".

Though the performances were really good and the story was easily followed and interesting the execution of the movie failed completely. There were parts that were simply idiotic with the characters being transferred into the world of a manga well almost. That aside the main character seemed to be drowned into the movie that didn't really help her set as a main lead and actually had her as a side role compared to the team and even her friend. The story itself was entertaining and you can't help but root for the team. But the way the team reached the finals the way they prepared even the way the characters were connected to one another were a mess. So I will be generous enough to give this movie 5 out of 10 only because of the performances and the good story.".

The mad doctor isolated on the remote island has spent years creating halfmen  halfanimals  some real abominations . Acceptable adaptation based on H.G. Wells' novel realized by and with remarkable makeup by John Chambers . It's an excitingly produced remake of 1933's Island of the lost souls with Lancaster heading a solid casting as a nutty doctor who develops a process of transforming animals into halfhumans at an desolated tropical island . Through experimentation MoreauBurt has upset the balance of nature . It starts when Michael York is shipwrecked at sea and arrives in a strange island where he's terrified to discover the terrible genetic experiments realized by Dr. Moreau .Passable horrorfantasy chiller that is developed up and down with some grotesque moments and in other side contains eerie and thrilling scenes. It results to be a strong rendition of H.G. Wells' novel about an isolated scientific who has spent several years creating halfanimals turning beasts into halfhuman . Cast is frankly well. Lancaster's sturdy acting and good secondary casting as Richard Bashehart displaying a magnificent portrayal of one of the beasts the lawsayer  Nigel Davenport and a gorgeous Barbara Carrera . Watchable by excellent makeup by the late John Chambers . Colorful cinematography by the classic cameraman Gerry Fisher and thrilling musical score by Laurence Rosenthal. The motion picture is well directed by Don Taylor . He was an actor and director as TV as cinema  he played one of the leads in the ArmyAir Force production of Hart's play Winged Victory . Returning to civilian life Taylor resumed his work in pictures with a top role in the trendsetting crime drama The naked city 1948 and played successful films as Destination Gobi  Battleground and Stalag 17.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie by accident due to a lastminute program change by the TV station. I had missed the first couple of minutes including the title so I was just as unprepared as the shipwrecked Andrew Michael York when he set foot on this beautiful tropical island. To his horror he finds out that an aging scientist presumed long dead by the world has populated the island with his children the results of his experiments in combining human and animal genes. What I found most astonishing was the authentic feel to the characters. Starting with Andrew. His initial repulsion develops into a discerning appreciation without ever condoning the monstrosity of Dr. Moreau's project. The old scientist himself Burt Lancaster a rather shallow performance in comparison is not an evil lunatic but a genius who got carried away convinced to the end of his own noble goals and best intentions. However the most amazing aspect is the differentiated portrayal of Moreau's more or less successful creatures. The movie manages to make your heart go out for them in their struggle to be human against their nature. The most poignant moment is the Lionman's farewell cry for his Master. An overall very satisfying movie despite some weaknesses in the development of the plot towards the end it feels like the director suddenly ran out of time. Quality sciencefiction with good entertainment value. 710".

I was pleasantly surprised by the acting yes even Michael York's as well as the makeup.Barbara Carrera was beautiful as always even though her character seemed to be more window dressing then integral to the plot. I'm not complaining mind you she makes lovely window dressing.Lancaster did an excellent job as Moreau. His subdued scientific detachment fit the part perfectly and it was interesting as he started going over the edge towards the end of the movie.York managed a very good scene when he as he was changing into an animal managed to remember things from his childhood as he desperately tried to keep his identity and humanity.Not the best movie that I've seen but it's in the top 10 or so. After watching this version it makes me even more appalled at the 1996 disaster. It's too bad that a lot of people now have an idea of what Island of Dr. Moreau based on that version instead of on this one.I'd give it an 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you saw this as a kid you always thought it was a classic. Although it doesn't hold up when one is an adult so much it is still a decent flick to watch if you sprained your ankle and can't get out of the house. The plot concerns a stranded engineer York of a freighter that lands on a remote island that is inhabited by strange creatures. Lancaster is superb as the ingenious Dr Monreau who is a gifted geneticist and biologist who wants to merge animals with man to get the perfect creation that only science can manufacture.

The makeup is excellent and the beast men are rather frightening not recommended for children under 7. Basheart plays the sayer of the law who as an aged and wisdom filled creature whom attempts to dissuade complete anarchy amongst the beast men. Not a bad production.".

Although it doesn't hold up when one is an adult so much it is still a decent flick to watch if you sprained your ankle and can't get out of the house. The plot concerns a stranded engineer York of a freighter that lands on a remote island that is inhabited by strange creatures. Lancaster is superb as the ingenious Dr Monreau who is a gifted geneticist and biologist who wants to merge animals with man to get the perfect creation that only science can manufacture.

	schema:reviewBody "Especially if you don't know what this movie is about before you're going to watch it you'll be gripped by its mysterious and tense build up.To be frank this movie has one of the best and most tense story build ups I have seen in a long time. For a long time it remains unclear what exactly is going on and what the movie will be about. As the movie progresses the movie does loose some of its power and tension when it falls into some obvious clichs and formulaic genre elements plus some just plain odd and poorly done sequences. But all is forgiven. All in all this version of the H.G. Wells remains a well done one with plenty of enough tense and mysterious moments in it which absolutely makes this movie distinct itself from other genre movies. In a way the movie and its build up and atmosphere really reminded me of Planet of the Apes 1968The build up and atmosphere is amazing in the first halve. It doesn't use any fancy tricks but leaves lots of things up to the viewers own imagination. The second halve is however quite different and in fact is nothing more than a typical genre piece from the '70's. Everything gets explained but at the same time everything also is far from believable. The horrormonster elements are hardly refreshing or new and in a way degrade the story and the movie in general. It definitely makes the second halve of the movie not as good as the first but the first halve builds up so many things in a great way that the second halve can't really ruin it that much. The Island of Dr. Moreau at all times remains a perfectly good watchable movie that is unique and a standout in its genre.Burt Lancaster does a good job at keeping his role simple and mysterious. Michael York works out way better as the main hero than you at first would expect.The settings are nice and so is the rest of the visual look. The makeup effects might look perhaps a bit outdated in todays perspective but they're actually quite above par. Also the musical score from Laurence Rosenthal is surprising great and works effective in the movie.Just forget the '96 version. This movie is in my opinion surprisingly a real mustsee!810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " A decent though unremarkable version of a H.G Wells novel.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Island Of Dr Moreau is one of my favourite books. Written by H.G Wells in 1896 it is a chilling and thoughtprovoking tale about a shipwrecked sailor who ends up on a remote island full of weird animals created by a vivisectionist. The book was first filmed in 1933 as the excellent Island Of lost Souls. This 1977 remake which is the first version to actually use the original title is not as good as the 1933 one but it still has moments of interest. It also remains moderately faithful to the source novel. The performances are quite strong and the film raises some disturbing questions which in my view is something that any science fiction movie worth its salt should aim to do.Following the loss of the ship Lady Vain English sailor Andrew Braddock the oftunderrated Michael York washes up on an island where he is found by a man named Montgomery Nigel Davenport. Montgomery takes Braddock to recover at a nearby jungle compound run by reclusive scientist Dr Moreau Burt Lancaster. Moreau has moved to this lost retreat after his theories and experiments invited great controversy and criticism in the real world. Pretty soon Braddock begins to realise that the doctor may well be up to his old experiments in the secluded privacy of his remote island mansion. Animallike servants work for the doctor strange halfanimal halfman creatures populate the neighbouring jungle and upon snooping around Moreau's laboratory Braddock learns that the doctor is presently operating on a bear in an effort to transform it into a man. It seems that Moreau is determined to develop a technique for turning beasts into people and has already created many beastmen who now live outside the compound under strict laws and rules dictated by Moreau himself. Braddock's arrival gives Moreau the chance to try a new experiment that he has been contemplating for quite some time.... the act of transforming a man into an animal.Lancaster is very good as Moreau playing the role more restrained than Charles Laughton in the 1933 version. Laughton was the archetypal mad scientist but Lancaster interprets the part more as a misguided man who allows his experiments to get out of hand simply because his enthusiasm and determination blind him to the potential hazards. Although released in 1977 the film ought to have been shot in black and white. The beach the jungle and the mansion look far too pleasant and paradiselike and this detracts from the film's sinister intentions. Black and white photography would have added considerably to the film's menacing atmosphere which is desired but not achieved by director Don Taylor. Also Barbara Carrera plays a female in Moreau's compound  possibly the most successful of his creations if you notice some of the unverified clues in the script  but her role is disappointingly wasted partly due to the ambiguity about whether she is a normal woman or a creation. The Island Of Dr Moreau is worth a look  it beats the hell out of the dire 1996 remake  but is still several levels down from The Island Of Lost Souls.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second film adaption of H. G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau I've seen the previous one being 1933's Island of Lost Souls.

He is found by Montgomery Nigel Davenport who introduces him to Dr. Paul Moreau Burt Lancaster. Living with him is the exotic and sexy Maria Barbara Carrera. Also inhabiting the island are various creatures led by the Sayer of the Law Richard Basehart. I'll stop there and just say compared with the Charles Laughton characterization Lancaster is very much more charming and subtle before we find out what he is capable of. Also Montgomery here seems a bit more cynical but is still convincing when he turns a corner. And this Braddock character doesn't have a fiance at home so he's...oh watch the movie. Besides more exciting action scenes there's an actual score by Laurence Rosenthal that compliments every segment it accompanies. And the tropical background scenes are so breathtaking. Kudos to director Don Taylor for making such a rousing adventurehorror film. And to American International usually known for making drivein exploitation features for such a fine quality product. Nothing much more to say except that I highly recommend this version of The Island of Dr. Moreau.".

Andrew Braddock Michael York is a castaway of a shipwreck who serendipitously lands on an isolated island in the Pacific and becomes the guest of the main inhabitant Dr Moreau who appears seemingly hospitable enough at first.

Braddock's stay is normal albeit boring at first not really much to do on an isolated island is there? then he begins to notice that things are not what they seem  the strange animal sounds that emanate from the forest at night and the weird facial features of the servants who wait upon the doctor. His worst fears are confirmed when he encounters the results of the doctor's experiments  upright hairy creatures who look like variations of the Wolfman of the old horror movies that appear human and yet are not exactly men though they wear clothing and can speak.

Frankly if you turn your color down and the contrast up a notch or two and watch either of these works in black and white mode the enjoyment factor is greatly elevated.What went right? Lancaster played his Moreau more casually calmly. Instead of attempting to copy Laughton's overthetop mad scientist routine he did well as the good man gone awry. He proceeds with his experiments seemingly out of a genuine caring for understanding rather than the old because I can or ruling the world ploys.The first half of this work is strong atmospheric and well done. The last half is more mechanical and plodding though the first half does a long way towards carrying it all through to the conclusion.Frankly this isn't as well done or enjoyable as the 1930's original but it's light years above the 1990's remake.

Granted those classic films in particular the Edgar Allan Poe flicks presented to us by Roger Corman were great but times changed and so did AIP. Budgets while still small were upped a tad and the actors employed had name value other than as AIP stars. A perfect example of that was this film.Andrew Braddock Michael York is a shipwrecked engineer who finds himself casts adrift on the shores of an unknown island. When he goes in search of water the only other survivor is carried off by an unseen force. Unaware of this Braddock is being tracked as well and in running finds himself caught in a ground trap saved actually from what was behind him.When he wakes he finds himself in bed and indoors a man named Montgomery Nigel Davenport at bedside. Montgomery tells him he is the guest of Dr. Moreau his employer and it isn't long before Moreau Burt Lancaster himself shows. Braddock is welcomed and told that it will be a while before another boat arrives.When feeling up to it Braddock gets out of bed and sees Moreau talking to a young woman. He finds out her name is Maria Barbara Carrera and that as Montgomery puts it is Moreau's. He rescued her as a young child and she is now willingly in his debt. Invited to dinner Moreau finds himself called away to handle a situation on the island and excuses himself.All moves along at a quick pace here with Braddock eventually learning what was out there in the jungle and what Moreau is up to. SPOILER ALERT. It seems that Moreau has been experimenting in gene therapy converting animals into human beings but not quite. That elusive last element still eludes him and rather than humans he's created humanimals animals standing on two legs with the ability to talk and think and yet still tied into those instincts placed there by the creator. How Braddock reacts what transpires when he finds a group of these humanimals and the plans Moreau have for him unfold before the final credits.Based on the novel by H.G. Wells the story has been used in several movies as well as this one. It is actually the fourth time the story was used. The movie is extremely well crafted with some great cinematography acting directing and some find makeup effects. At the same time there is nothing to make it stand out above the rest. It's wellmade and not quite generic in how that comes across but not exceptional at the same time.And yet the movie never fails to entertain. The story holds your interests as does the telling of it which could have gone terribly wrong. Instead we're witness to one star whose glow was beginning to fade in Lancaster who still remains a strong presence an actor who was at his peak in popularity in York and an actress who made a splash with this film only to never rise much higher. Their combined efforts make the movie an enjoyable old style story that leans more towards science fiction than horror that will have you staying with it till the end.Olive Films has released this one with a minimum of extras including a commentary track a visual essay and the original trailer. Still the picture clarity is above most and the value is there. Fans will want to pick the film up AIP completest will want to add it to their collection and horrorscifi fans will want to enjoy it as well.".

Once there he is introduced to Dr. Moreau Burt Lancaster who at first seems like a nice guy simply doing research. Pretty soon Andrew begins to realize that the doctor is doing strange experiments between men and animals and the result are some mutated creatures living in the jungle.Whenever people speak about the H.G. Wells adaptations of this story it seems this one here is forgotten and sometimes it doesn't even come up. Of course they always discuss the greatness of 1932's ISLAND OF LOST SOULS and they always discuss the disastrous Marlon Brando version. Why is this film from 1977 rarely mentioned? I'm going to guess because it's not really a flatout horror movie. The majority of its running time it appears to be trying to be a real medical drama and a showcase for Lancaster.Is that a bad thing? I personally don't think so but it does make for a rather slow running time and I'm sure some people would have preferred more horror elements or more of a spotlight being placed on the creatures. With that said I think this is a mildly entertaining movie thanks in large part to the performances in the film. Lancaster always carried himself with such grace that he had no problem fitting into this role to where people could see this character and think that he was a good man. I thought Lancaster was good in the part although the screenplay never really allowed him a chance to go crazy or mad.York was also good in the lead role although his character too suffers from not getting too much to do until the very end. Nigel Davenport is good in the supporting role as the doctor's help and Barbara Carrera made for a good love interest. Richard Basehart got to play the role originated by Bela Lugosi and I couldn't help but think that Basehart had seen the earlier version and remembered Lugosi's performance.With all of that said the film really does come to life during the final fifteenminutes once the creatures decide that they have had enough. I thought the various animals that were used were great and I also thought the action was nice. There were some tense moments that happened during the final action sequence so overall the film at least goes out on a good note.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Island of Dr. Moreau was a very well done science fiction movie of Hollywood fantasy. The movie has you on the edge of your seat. It had a very good exiting story to it. They also did a very good job with the make up of the beast people. I thought Burt Lancaster was a marvelous actor as well as Micheal York. The movie had a good blend of science fiction and mystery. Especially where Braddock sees all these young women servants but when he has a closer look at them they turned out to be animals to. The story had a similar plot to another movie I saw called The Twilight People. I have also seen the lated version of The Island of Dr. Moreau which had Marlin Brando but I still prefer the 1977 version with Burt Lancaster much better.

	onyx:emotionText "The Island of Dr. Moreau was a very well done science fiction movie of Hollywood fantasy. The movie has you on the edge of your seat. It had a very good exiting story to it. They also did a very good job with the make up of the beast people. I thought Burt Lancaster was a marvelous actor as well as Micheal York. The movie had a good blend of science fiction and mystery. Especially where Braddock sees all these young women servants but when he has a closer look at them they turned out to be animals to. The story had a similar plot to another movie I saw called The Twilight People. I have also seen the lated version of The Island of Dr. Moreau which had Marlin Brando but I still prefer the 1977 version with Burt Lancaster much better. But now these days with all the cloning and other kinds of genetic engineering experiments going on which is said to be only the tip of the iceberg this raises what some may consider a good question. How far removed is such a movie from the realm of possibility?";

	schema:reviewBody "A lifeboat drifts aimless in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Englishman Andrew Braddock Micheal York and his mate Charlie have been adrift for 17 days before they reach land. They wash up on a beautiful exotic island. Charlie is in a bad state and Braddock leaves him behind to search for food and water. While Braddock is gone Charlie is attacked by someone or something. Braddock hears strange noises in the dense thick jungle. Braddock starts to run and promptly falls into a pit. When Braddock comes round he is lying in bed in a mansion that belongs to genetic scientist Dr. Paul Moreau Burt Lancaster. Braddock has landed on the island of Dr. Moreau who has created a safe isolated hideaway from the rest of the world to conduct his experiments. Moreau lives on the island with his adopted daughter Maria Barbara Carrera a mercenary for protection named Montgomery Nigel Davenport and a servant called M'Ling Nick Cravat. After Braddock has been introduced to everyone he begins to question Moreau about his motives for being on the island. Moreau claims that he is able to alter the human gene and control it making it become what he wishes instead of what nature intended. At night Braddock hears strange animal like howls and screams. Braddock eventually finds Dr. Moreau's laboratory and proof of Moreau's hideous genetic experiments! As Braddock discovers more and more about Moreau and the creatures he has created he wants to leave. Unfortunately Dr. Moreau informs Braddock the next supply ship isn't due for another two years. Moreau soon decides that Braddock is a liability and uses him in one of his experiments just as the freakish manimals turn on their creator and all those associated with him in a fiery climactic confrontation! Directed by Don Taylor I thought this was average at best. The script by Al Ramrus and John Herman Shaner based on the novel by H.G. Wells is a little on the slow and uneventful side. Braddock arrives on island finds Moreau and his experiments develops a conscience gets the girl and escapes the island as the tables are turned on Moreau by his genetic creations. That really is the whole film. Nothing really happens to push the story or characters forward to the next level. The ending of the film also disappoints as it comes across as rather flat dull  predictable. The film never leaves the island and there are only four human characters in the entire film and Carrera is only there to look good. The acting is OK but both York and Lancaster are miscast and just don't fit their roles that well. The prosthetic special make up effects on Moreau's genetic creations are good even if you can tell it's just people under a few layers of latex and glued on hair. The Island of Dr. Moreau as a whole is generally well made the lush jungle greenery  golden sandy beaches of the sunny Virgin Island locations look stunning throughout  the cinematography by Gerry Fisher captures it nicely enough. The production is also good with impressive looking sets. Overall the Island of Dr. Moreau is an OK timewaster but ultimately it's not a film that really sticks in the memory because of it's somewhat sedate pace.Worth watching just don't go to too much trouble to do so. Nothing particularly bad but at the same time nothing particularly good.".

So he decided to make a movie without any violence to remind people that he was a much more rounded talent than that. Are you sure about this? the world asked. Yes he replied... and made Kikujiro.Kikujiro is difficult to adequately describe but the fact that it was allegedly inspired by the Wizard of Oz is a good starting point. The basic premise is a road trip where Kitano is the unlikely chaperone for a little boy who wants to go and find his mother. After gambling away all the money his wife gives him to take the kid they have to improvise their transport across the country. Along the way they meet a small but colourful cast of characters and get to know each other a little bit too.I'd hesitated about picking this up for ages and eventually went for a rental rather than a purchase. Kitano minus violence just didn't seem right! But that was definitely an injustice I was doing him and Kikujiro is a good demonstration that his talents really are much broader. In fact after watching it there is no doubt that he is one of the greatest directoractorwriter and editor working in the world today. A brilliantly painted story full of subtly and quirkiness. Awesome cinematography and an incredible soundtrack... truly world class in every respect. Well to be fair the child actor was a bit stiff but it seems mean to hold that against the movie. Definitely recommended if you haven't already seen it!".

	schema:headline " Beat Takeshi's Audacious Edgy and Heartwarming Road Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "In the title role of this highly original 1999 road movie Beat Takeshi  with his twitching eye and bowlegged shuffle  looks and acts like a cross between Mickey Rourke and Harvey Keitel with a heavy dose of Walter Matthau's sourpuss demeanor circa The Bad News Bears for good measure. He creates a truly memorable character  cynically profane unapologetically insulting childishly manipulative and somehow likable. As the director and screenwriter of said film Takeshi Kitano  the same guy  has fashioned something quite unique from a tired premise  a boy's search for his mother and the gruff man who begrudgingly helps find her. What could have been a predictable and sentimental wallow especially with the indiscriminate use of angels as a pervasive symbol is instead an idiosyncratic emotionally adroit film that sometimes simmers on the cusp of violence.Yet it becomes ultimately affecting almost in spite of itself. In fact Kitano does such a resolutely offbeat job that at certain times the film reminds me of the narrative ellipses and low steady shots that were the trademark of Yasujiro Ozu's home dramas intermingled with a surprisingly intense Quentin Tarantinolike inyourface edginess. The protagonist of the film is really the latchkey nineyear old Masao who is on a quest to find the mother whom his grandmother says is away working. With his sad eyes and cherubic face Yusuke Sekiguchi is perfectly cast as Masao providing the moral compass for the story. Whether he is running with his arms flailing or forlornly playing soccer by himself he is poignant without being saccharine and completely natural. It is Masao's scrapbook that provides the framework for the film lending each chapter a descriptive title. Every chapter has a distinct character that is in various turns playful hilarious disturbing surreal and heartbreaking. Case in point Kitano is not afraid to use a child molester as first an uncomfortable source of black humor and then as the subject of Masao's nightmare. My favorite scenes come toward the end when Kikujiro organizes a motley crew of misfits to play games with Masao and have them masquerade as Indians aliens marine life and even watermelons. The variety in tone between chapters makes for unexpected tonal shifts but somehow it works and adds to the greater context of the story.That Kitano is able to manage a consistent filmmaking style with a strong visual sense is a credit to the talent behind the camera  not only Kitano's direction script and film editing but also his artwork showcased throughout the movie Katsumi Yanagishima's sharply rendered cinematography and Joe Hisaishi's evocative Windham Hilllike score. There are some funny sideline performances from Gidayu Great and Rakkyo Ide as Fatso and Baldy two bikers who turn out to be the Abbott and Costello of softhearted slackers Nezumi Mamura as a freespirited drifter Fumie Hosokawa as a relentlessly perky girl with a talent for juggling and in the opening sequence Kayoko Kishimoto as Kikujiro's takenoprisoners wife. Kitano however elicits the most laughs if only for the film's central conceit that he gets away with his infantile gangster behavior. One would think the story would climax when Masao comes upon his mother but Kitano confounds expectations with every new scene. The DVD really has no extras other than a couple of trailers not related to the film not coincidentally one is for Walter Salles' Central Station which has a similar story structure. I know this film has its detractors especially among fans of Kitano's bloodier work but I find it intriguingly ambiguous and thoroughly enjoyable.".

Much of the movie is playful but then much of 'Sonatine' was too only 'Kikujiro' doesn't mix that up with the orgy of violence you might expect from watching Kitano's better known movies. However it does have some dark moments that you would NEVER see in a Hollywood film dealing with similar heart warming subject matter especially the scary man sequence featuring Akaji Maro an actor you might recognise from Tarantino's 'Kill Bill'.

How can grownup simple man witch is not quite good in relationships with people can spent so much time with little boy. How so violent person can show beautiful world to sad little boy. Takeshi is one of my favorite actordirectorwriter. I discovered him just by being bored with allthesame Hollywood movies. Now thanks to him I'm truly in love with Asian movies.

The tittle is Kitano's father name.In Kitano's biography it is said that Kitano's father was an alcoholic and would spend most of the money he earned on alcohol and when he had been drinking he would become violent and beat up both his wife and his kids. Eventually Kikujiro left his family.I know Kitano Takeshi made this film because he has been tired of violencegangsterslifedeath in his previous film but what made him writing a story about his fathera man who abandoned his family when Kitano was young. If you read Kitano Takeshi's biography you should see his childhood memory in Masao. Kikujiro  in the film is a corrupted person. But also in the film Masao eventually respects and loves to play with that childish man who keeps smoking and shouting at people. Does Kitano himself desire a father too much so he is willing to accept his father's bad habits as long as his father is still at his side.It is not really a film I'd say I feel like I am seeing the characters in real life. From the start Masao has drawn Kikujiro in his diary. The ending is also the beginning. Kitano didn't make a happy ending nor a sad ending. Our 3 hours is just to see the beginning of a fatherandson relationship which would grows by the time. Remember Masao just knew Kikujiro's name in the end of the film and Kikujiro said Let's do it again some time. The cycle of life in Kikujiro go on forever. The feeling is too real. I have forgot that I were watching a movie. There is no simple words that can describe this movie completely u have to watch it by yourself".

There are no cops or graphic depictions of violence. There are still some gangstertype characters but the encounters are simple requiring no synthesis. Kitano's familiar elements and locales are present drawings vignettes seaside temple and angels. It's really a loving portrayal of one little boy Masao's summer spent with this seemingly eccentric retired gangster Mister played by Kitano. We have a pair of comic bikers a lone van traveler an arguing truck driver a fun juggling couple prankish hitchhiking gags and a rather extensive betting session at the bicycle races. There are occasions for sentimental tears for instance when Mister took a side trip to visit his own mother but play is the key operative here. Even though the child appears to be a sulky nonsmiling little boy most of the time a boy will be a boy when it comes to play and open up to lightness of the heart. If you're the hurrying kind this film may not be for you. The film is at its own flow and pace. It's Masao's summer vacation adventures and he's not in a hurry to go home.  Joe Hisaishi's theme music for Kikujiro certainly is catchy and the score gave Kitano's film its rhythm and accents along this unlikely pair's journey  a grown man who's become childlike once more while escorting Masao on his quest to fulfill the dream of seeing his mother.  Does it matter whether Masao sees his mother or not? He gains a friend Kikujiro.Kudos to Sony Pictures Classics for their film distribution selections!

	schema:headline " Reminds me I'm not the only person who feels alone and let down by life";
	schema:reviewBody "I think Kikujiro is mainly about loneliness.Takeshi's character and the boy Masao seem really different on the surface. Takeshi's provokes people is loud and rude. Masao is quiet and sad.But they're really the same person someone whose life is full of disappointment abandonment. They both feel isolated like no one could understand. They might be pitied but no one could understand like they'd been there like they'd lived that kind of life.And when you get really lonely like that I think it makes you bitter. The whole world continues to smile and sing its fortunes while your life seems to get worse and worse less and less reason to stay living.Masao is very withdrawn because of this. Over time as he gets older I can see him getting more and more bitter about it. Maybe Takeshi's character was like Masao at first too. Lonely and sad. And then maybe he thought why should I be sad? All the world has brought me is misfortune. I should rather be angry! and then started trying to provoke and anger people on purpose. Why should they be content anyway? But all the other characters they meet on the journey are like that too. Isolates people on the edge of society people who might call themselves countercultural or something like that. What I think is really important is how they change over the course of the movie. Like they might have the liberty to sit around all day smoking and brooding and depressed. Masao is only a child and all this kind of disappointment is new to him.In a less realistic film maybe the characters would be in their characteristic brooding way like Eh them's the breaks huh kid. In Kikujiro they're people. They can see how much he's like them how much pain he's in. And they're so jaded because they're still hurting too.So they try and cheer him up play games with him. Show him the kind of love he never got from anyone else in his life that they never got. And it's so touching because they especially Takeshi's character start to see it's not so bad not so hopeless. That everyone loves and everyone cries and just because their lives have been particularly worse than others doesn't mean they can't reach out to and come to an understanding with others.The film's long takes sometimes feel kinda pointless like they're just there because that's part of the director's style. But other times they really work especially in the more emotional scenes. They help say more than any amount of ridiculous sad symphonic music could.And the music which is intermittent and plays on a single theme is really good too. It doesn't feel like some kind of deliberately tragic clich but still adds a great amount to the mood of the movie and helped bring me to tears at some points.Some negative reviews I've read call Kikujiro shallow or emotionally manipulative but I can't see that at all. The whole thing is very human and doesn't force any moral down your throat other than that I guess that you are not so alone. And it feels like it's coming from someone who has been alone who has felt this incredible sadness and also conquered it. And I think that means more than I can really put into words.".

Over time as he gets older I can see him getting more and more bitter about it. Maybe Takeshi's character was like Masao at first too. Lonely and sad. And then maybe he thought why should I be sad? All the world has brought me is misfortune. I should rather be angry! and then started trying to provoke and anger people on purpose. Why should they be content anyway? But all the other characters they meet on the journey are like that too. Isolates people on the edge of society people who might call themselves countercultural or something like that. What I think is really important is how they change over the course of the movie. Like they might have the liberty to sit around all day smoking and brooding and depressed. Masao is only a child and all this kind of disappointment is new to him.In a less realistic film maybe the characters would be in their characteristic brooding way like Eh them's the breaks huh kid. In Kikujiro they're people. They can see how much he's like them how much pain he's in. And they're so jaded because they're still hurting too.So they try and cheer him up play games with him. Show him the kind of love he never got from anyone else in his life that they never got. And it's so touching because they especially Takeshi's character start to see it's not so bad not so hopeless. That everyone loves and everyone cries and just because their lives have been particularly worse than others doesn't mean they can't reach out to and come to an understanding with others.The film's long takes sometimes feel kinda pointless like they're just there because that's part of the director's style. But other times they really work especially in the more emotional scenes. They help say more than any amount of ridiculous sad symphonic music could.And the music which is intermittent and plays on a single theme is really good too. It doesn't feel like some kind of deliberately tragic clich but still adds a great amount to the mood of the movie and helped bring me to tears at some points.Some negative reviews I've read call Kikujiro shallow or emotionally manipulative but I can't see that at all. The whole thing is very human and doesn't force any moral down your throat other than that I guess that you are not so alone. And it feels like it's coming from someone who has been alone who has felt this incredible sadness and also conquered it. And I think that means more than I can really put into words.";

Takeshi Kitanos 1999 film is about a young boy searching for his estranged mother in his summer vacation. The journey towards his mother would have remain simple and he could have met his settled mother and his life still would have remain sad only if he had gone to meet his mother alone. Kikujiro went with him and shared a wild misadventure together which changed both of their lives. Kikujiro is an aggressive middle aged crook.

Thats why he gets angry  put his foul mouthed conversation into anyone It is just because he doesn't want to be happy and shows the cynical nature just because he was suffering. In one of the scenes from the film when he requests Fatso the biker to help him get to the old house where he sees his mother sitting lonely on the table. He just watches her and fears to go near to her and spend a whole day in silence. This shows how he had lived his life in a suffocation of alienation. How he had utterly desired to be accepted among the civilized Japanese Society. When he was ignored and alienated from that part of good society he became a rebel in the form of goons. He had idolized the Yakuza because it was the only way of Solace for him. Masao and Kikujiro takes a wild road trip into a Japanese countryside where they meet Angel like strangers who in real life were outcast and alienated people. They became friends and share a beautiful childish holiday together. They were all outcast in search of whole happiness. The real and civilized people were portrayed as demons and were treated in a cynical and unromantic nature. The unforgettable things about this film are its characters like the lonely poet baldy Fatso and the soothing soundtrack from Joe Hisaishi. A great film worth watching. Two Thumbs Up!

We see him smile way more than usual and he is clearly a guy with a big heart even though he perhaps doesn't want to show it. Yusuke Sekiguchi plays the young boy and what's interesting is he hasn't starred in anything else. He plays his character really well and you really feel sympathetic for the kid. The connection between the two characters is also really great and believable. It's certainly a strength of the movie. All the other people they encounter on their trip are also great and fun to watch which adds to the movie.The film is interestingly shot and edited. Strange dream sequences are shown throughout and shots showing little details are often. It's these kinds of touches that Kitano adds which just enhance the film watching experience. The film also has a strong feeling of nostalgia which a lot of Kitanos films seem to have. It's hard to explain but it's there. I think the films biggest issue however is that it does feel quite long. It's about two hours and it feels pretty long. Perhaps sections could have been edited down such as the games being played towards the end. It could be because you kind of get a climax of their adventure the main thing they are trying to accomplish but it happens at the half way mark meaning there is still and hour left. I think that kind of throws off the pace which maybe wouldn't have been so bad if some later scenes were added in before that climax.Overall this is a very touching and beautiful film. It shows Kitanos more sensitive side and I think it is a very personal film for him.".

	schema:reviewBody "The directorstareditor of Kikujiro Takeshi Kitano began with stage comedy then became known for his hyperviolent yet hypnotically artistic gangster films and is now known as a modern master of art cinema. As the story goes some time in the late 1990s Kitano suffered a neardeath motorcycle accident and immediately following it he made this film... which many fans call his best.His style is very photographic meaning each shot is composed carefully like something you'd see on the wall of an art gallery. As such he doesn't rely too heavily on motion or dialogue and the effect can be both powerful and hilarious. If a picture is worth a 1000 words Takeshi Kitano milks every last syllable.Kikujiro is a beautifully wicked road movie about a cute little kid looking for his momma. What gives it an edge is the fact that the kid gets paired up with the most unlikely guardian the world has ever known. Takeshi Kitano plays the guardian a loudmouthed selfish goodfornothing troublemaker who decides to exploit the kid for all he's worth. You learn quickly that this is NOT a cutesy Disney flick. Instead it's an edgy slightly dark yet thoroughly charming story about innocence in a notsoinnocent world. I could go on for ages about the clever symbolism and poetic themes the complexity of Takeshi Kitano's character the power of the film's final scene... but that's for you to figure out when you watch it and on your 2nd 3rd or 4th watch I've seen this movie half a dozen times myself and I can't wait to see it again.The comedy is very quirky and not everyone will get it. But if you do you'll be howling in the aisles. It's somewhat surreal and most of the humor stems from the idea that Kitano's character is so preposterous and his actions so unrealistic that you can't help but say WTF. It's even funnier if you realize that Japanese society is quite conservative and the situations depicted in the movie would be downright scandalous. In that respect it could almost be classed as a surrealist comedy alongside Airplane! and the Naked Gun movies. This may be a stretch but I'd also compare it to the mockumentary masterpiece This is Spinal Tap or some of the other great Christopher Guest films.One last thing I have to mention The musical score is AMAZING. I've never heard an original score fit a film so perfectly as this. Composed by the great Joe Hisaishi master of a thousand styles the music for Kikujiro is simple childlike and majestic at the same time. It's even more uplifting than the Amelie soundtrack.The music the photography the gags and the story make this one of my favorite films of all time... definitely one I keep coming back to whenever I need a boost.".

As the story goes some time in the late 1990s Kitano suffered a neardeath motorcycle accident and immediately following it he made this film... which many fans call his best.His style is very photographic meaning each shot is composed carefully like something you'd see on the wall of an art gallery.

	schema:reviewBody "By one of these coincidences that make you wonder the very day the strongest earthquake in memory hit Japan a Japanese film festival took place at the cinematheque in my city. 'Kikujiro' which I saw last night is a very special film in the Japanese cinema and in the filmography of Takeshi Kitano.The fans of Kitano will notice that he is taking the character he usually plays in the gangster movies and creates here a failed version of it. He is dominated by a badmouthed wife. His walk is uncertain closer to Chaplin's than to a well assured yakuza. He does have a scaring tattoo on his back but this becomes just the reason of the bad dreams of his little boy friend. When confronted with a gang of local gangsters he ends by being beaten in a situation in which his self from other movies would have killed his opponents in a fraction of time. All over the film he looks more like inadequate and unadapted to reality.There is however much more in the character than this. The name  which we learn in the last scene  is the real name of Takeshi Kitano's father which is said to have shared at least some of the vices of the character in the movie like gambling. This is a personal film in which a lonely young kid gradually gains some kind of a father instead of the one he never had. The feelings of the little boy and his permanently sad look may have been inspired by the feelings of kid Takeshi and his disappointments in the relation with his father.By the time Kitano made this movie the 'grumpy man  lonely kid' films which had the classic in Chaplin's Vagabond were making a comeback. In 1996 the Czech 'Kolya' had moved audiences and the Oscar jury with the story of the relation between the Czech musician and a Russian kid in occupied Czechoslovakia. Two years earlier Natalie Portman's first breakthrough was in 'Leon' where she befriended another gangster played by the wonderful Jean Reno. Kitano was not afraid to take over a popular theme which he developed adding to it other dimensions to the merge of mature and childish loneliness. The film speaks about inadaptation and about the right to be different. It brings on screen characters to illustrate that different people can get together and create beauty from weird. The Poet and the two motorcyclists seem to come out from the Land of Oz in a very different road experience.The style of the film is inspired by some of the Japanese popular culture techniques and form of art. The kid's dreams look like traditional theater scenes. A toy he receives and starts relating to it as an amulet looks like one of artist's Takashi Murakami gadgets. Acting is excellent and the music belongs to Joe Hisaishi a composer famous in Japan and author of the soundtrack of more than 100 films. While you need to make a small effort to get into the mood and buy the transformation of the traditional gangster image in Kitano's films 'Kikujiro' ends by being a very satisfying cinema experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kikujiro no Natsu has gathered public and critical acclaim over the years so it gives me no pleasure as a Kitano fan to state that the film is a flabby undisciplined and selfindulgent episode in Kitano's film career. Kitano reverses his usual protagonist traits  the stoic silent guy gives way to a volatile motormouth. The trademark graphicschlock violence takes place offscreen. The tale is wellworn the odd couple thrown together set out on a journey that changes both of their lives. Unfortunately there is no evolution in the relationship to an emotional climax just a few titters along the way.The child character Masao is problematic. His quest is to meet his real mother whose abandonment of him at an early age is never really explained to Masao or the audience. At the moment where he sees his mother and her new family it is not made clear what effect this has had on him. He cries but does his past no matter how traumatic now make sense to him? Kikujiro sets out to distract the boy and succeeds immediately. There is no progression in the boys recovery from the shock of seeing his mother for the first time  in fact five minutes later it is as if the whole episode had never happened. At the end when Kikujiro says Let's look for your mother again we do not know if the boy is aware of the lie or not. Strangely for this kind of movie we do not care about the boy. Compare the child protagonists in Stand By Me Leon or Sixth Sense. This is not a cultural thing as evidenced by the sympathetic portrayal of children abandoned by adults in Koreeda's Nobody Knows or Iwai's Swallowtail Butterfly. In Kikujiro no Natsu little Masao is more a totem pole for Kitano and his buddies to rehash their slapstick comedy routines around.The character of Kikujiro does not make sense either. The moment when he realises the parallels between his own life and Masao's is hackneyed in the extreme a soliloquy to off camera. His interaction with the boy is superficial and the interaction of Kitano with the various quirky characters they encounter does not make any sense either comedic or plot driven. His visit to his mother in her Retirement Home merely ices the cake too sweetly.The film seems to show more of the other Kitano Beat the TV personality than Takeshi the filmmaker. The camping sequence with the obsequious bikers could come straight from one of his goofy game shows. The interaction with the farmerbanker at the bus stop is mildly funny if you realise the actor is Kitano's older brother but just bizarre otherwise. Some excellent cinematography and an outstanding score from Joe Hisaishi are two compensations in this disappointing illadvised film.".

Wonderful work from everyone led by a luminous Vanessa Redgrave as a dying deluded Newport matron and Claire Danes as her much younger self. Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer is like Mama the real deal Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman circa 1958 and doesn't overplay the charm and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins contributing sharp detailed cameos. Hugh Dancy also from the stage doesn't bring much edge to the somewhat clichd role of an unhappy rich wastrel and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow. But it's a deliberately paced visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues and you can cry at it and not feel like you're being recklessly manipulated. Also what a sumptuous parade of 1940s50s automobiles.".

Hugh Dancy also from the stage doesn't bring much edge to the somewhat clichd role of an unhappy rich wastrel and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow. But it's a deliberately paced visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues and you can cry at it and not feel like you're being recklessly manipulated. Also what a sumptuous parade of 1940s50s automobiles.";

	schema:reviewBody "I caught Evening in the cinema with a lady friend. Evening is a chick flick with no apologies for being such but I can say with some relief that it's not so infused with estrogen that it's painful for a redblooded male to watch. Except for a single instance at the very end of the movie I watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any selfindulgent melodrama. Ladies for their part will absolutely love this movie.Ann Lord is elderly bedridden and spending her last few days on Earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side. Discomfited by the memories of her past Ann suddenly calls out a man's name her daughters have never heard before Harris. While both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mother's strong urge to recall and redress her illfated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times Ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met Harris  and in doing so lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with.Both Ann and her two daughters  one married with children one a serial commitophobe  struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists and perhaps more importantly if true love can endure the test of time. Are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever? Will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome? The subtle fact that the aged Ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters.The cinematography for Evening is interesting  most of the film is spent in Ann's mind as she recalls the past and for that reason I think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed to give everyone an ethereal glow and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real but occurred in the past. Claire Danes is beautiful appearing to be really really tall though just 5' 5 in reality and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test.You can't really talk trash about the cast which leads off with Claire Danes and doesn't let up from there Vanessa Redgrave Patrick Wilson Meryl Streep and Glenn Close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film.I can't really say anything negative about this film at all though Hugh Dancy's struggle to have his character emerge from utter onedimensionality is in the end a total loss. Playing the spoiled lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doesn't offer much in the way of character exploration  he had his orders and stuck to them.In the end gentlemen your lady friend will most certainly weep and while you'll likely not feel nearly as affected the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching Evening. Catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of Die Hard 4 or the upcoming Rambo flick. It'll be your little secret that this viewing didn't really cost you much at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since starting to read the book this movie is based on I'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result. I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of Atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book I've ever seen it would probably not have mattered.I'm trying to figure out what the cause is and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it.It's not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie which is why since I started reading the novel I'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie it's more like some books just can't make the transition. Ms. Minton's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be I feel not filmable. I think that Ms. Minton's work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its value.I cannot yet report that Evening the film does not represent Evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since I'm only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess I'm writing this because I feel that if you're going to adapt a novel adapt it but don't make it something else that it's not. I'm not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway and we would not have Evening in its distressed form if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But it's too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone because Evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.Thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are.".

The flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young Ann is in the wedding of her friend Lila. At the wedding she meets Harris who will impact her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter Constance is older more responsible a mother of two and has things together. Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life.First of all the good. The period detail in the movie is great. The dresses hair cars houses etc. really put you in another time and place. And there is some very quality acting in the movie. Vanessa Redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young and she is an outstanding singer. Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to the character of Lila's brother Buddy.Now for the bad which unfortunately is everything else. Things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. Then... you are supposed to believe that she doesn't really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her. And I thought the whole he might be gay thing was out of the blue and didn't serve a purpose.Then we have Harris. The character acts wooden and creepy. Had this been another genre you would have known that Harris was the serial killer from the get go. It is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out.And the grandest problem of all. Why don't Ann and Harris get together? They fall for each other. They have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener's shack come home to find out about Buddy's tragic end and then...Nothing.They meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and I couldn't help but wondering why. WHY? The movie doesn't let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so I had a hard time feeling sorry for them.The part of the story in the present is fairly boring. The clich good daughter and the clich bad daughter. Nina changes over the course of the movie but I am not sure why. I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. There is a touching scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old Ann dreaming she's chasing a butterfly. It is really lame and embarrassing.There are no mistakes Ann advises at us. The statement doesn't ring true with the story. And it doesn't ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn't wasted the talent of such good actors.".

	schema:headline " A great chick flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Evening is the beautiful story of the flawed love of a mother. The  movie split in time is magically shot amazingly acted and has a  touching script.   Vanessa Redgrave plays Anne Grant Lord a woman sunsetting out of  life. Lying in her bed her mind remembering and misfiring she recalls  her first mistake. Claire Danes plays the young Anne giving a youthful  vitality to dying bed ridden woman. Daughters Nina Toni Collette and  Constance Natasha Richardson try to decipher the real story from the  disheartening dementia. Her first mistake revolves around Harris Arden  Patrick Wilson the man her best friend Lila Mamie Gummer deeply  loved. The daughters must come to terms with their mother's past and  their futures.  The cast is glowing in Evening. The collective acting energy of this  movie could have powered the equipment for the production of this  entire film. I am so glad to see Claire Danes working again especially  in this role. She is so young and alive fully living the joys  mistakes and heartbreak of young Anne's first mistake. This is a true  feat when you realize she is playing a woman dying in bed. When her  life overwhelms her you can feel her desire to crack and her hopeless  hope that she won't. Some of her facial expressions grinded on me a  little but over all her performance was so radiant I was left with  that only as a side note.   Toni Collette continues to prove that you can be a powerful actress  without being a super model. She plays the black sheep of the family a  little lost. Nina finds a great deal of strength in her mother's  mistake. Collette delicately avoids creating a cruel character who  revels in the mistakes of her mother instead choosing the wiser path  of learning from her mother's mistakes. There is a great deal of  infighting between Nina and her sister Constance. Their fights remind  me of ones I have with my sister all the time.   Mamie Gummer who plays Anne's youthful best friend is wonderful. Her  character is stuck between her heart and her status in society. Even  when she is crying and her heart is breaking she is incredibly regal  and charming. I can't wait to see her act in something else in the  future.   Vanessa Redgrave's performance is very hard for me to describe. Her  talent at making her mental status ambiguous without being wacko or  even especially tragic is why it is so powerful. The audience does not  know if she is making up the story because she is slipping away or if  these events truly happened. Physically and emotionally speaking  Redgrave is acting in a box. Not much physical space and limited  emotional range might have been a stunner to a lesser actress but she  makes the limitations work for her. I was constantly amazed.  The movie is definitely womanfocused but the men in the movie are not  just accessories. Patrick Wilson is mesmerizing as Harris. It is no  wonder that everyone in the movie is in love with him I sure was.  Buddy Wittenborn is Lila's brother spiraling out of control. Hugh  Dancy spirals Buddy out of control without sending his acting down the  drain.   Glen Close has my favorite scene in the movie. It reminded me of the  famous scene from Monster's Ball. It is terrible and jaw dropping  grief. I was utterly stunned.  The one acting disappointment was Natasha Richardson. While her fight  scenes were memorable most of her acting reeks of melodrama. It would  have suited her to take an acting bath before we had to breathe her  stink. It's a good thing she wasn't in charge of the visuals. The  visuals of the movie are sparkling. Cinematographer Gyula Pados  couldn't make a film richer in color light so perfectly matched to  mood and emotion. The visual concepts of the flash back sequences are  powerful and resonating. There were many scenes that could have been  stopped printed mounted and sold as art.  I admit it I cried. Evening is a powerful movie. Evening is defiantly  a chick flick but a really great chick flick. If you want to impress a  woman with a movie choice pick Evening.".

	schema:headline " Worth watching for Hugh Dancy alone";
	schema:reviewBody "Evening tells a story worth hearing but unfortunately it gets lost along the way. There's too much focus on the present  not just Vanessa Redgrave's performance as the older Ann but mostly the subplot regarding her children. It's necessary to come to the present at times so that we can see how what has happened in the past has affected her and how she chooses to remember but the rest of it just weighs the film down without complementing it as it was meant to. The performances in the present scenes also lack the same elegance as those that take place in the past. Collette is a great actress but she and her boyfriend's actor both give average performances that just get in the way. The story that takes place in the past dealing with love identity and choice all within a few days time is where the film truly shines. Danes of course gives a great performance but Dancy is the one who steals the spotlight with what I feel should've garnered him a nomination for supporting actor at the Academy awards. The story is eloquent melancholy and can be felt as well as understood from deeper thought. If it weren't so muddled by what takes place in the present then it could've been a great film but as it stands with the way it is I can only call it good but not great. Another point of interest is the film's score which is just absolutely beautiful. So if you want to see a good movie then Evening is for you  just don't expect every piece to be wondrous as the wonder occurs in the past and is watered down by the present. That's just how I felt about it.".

John Greenleaf WhittierEvening is dominated by regret saturated so completely I regret having seen the film. Well not quite but rarely has a film had such an accomplished cast and highclass writing pedigree and disappointed me so thoroughly. The regret theme is hammered home so superficially I was driven to try to remember lines from The Great Gatsby to mitigate my growing anger at being treated by the filmmakers as if I could not endure subtlety or ambivalence. In other words I got it from the first scene where Vanessa Redgrave looks out over her Newport memory at her young self Claire Danes and begins what have to be the easiest lines she's ever had playing an aging romantic Why didn't I marry Harris? The variations on this theme in the movie are legion even when it's not the young doctor played by Patrick Wilson whom her friend Lila Mamie Gummerlooking very much like her aunt Meryl Streep also regrets not marrying.One of my major problems is that it's never clear why these substantial women spent so much emotional coin on a character we never get to know except for his Paul Newmanish good looks. But like the rest of the regretladen characters this film spends no dramatic coin on depthall is skating on the surface letting us do the subtextual work rather than the dialogue. In the coda Old Lila Streep makes an attempt at character deconstruction by saying about women We are mysterious creatures. Give me a break could I have a bit more than platitude?A regrettable life is Buddy's Hugh Dancy Lila's drunken poetic brother who tries to prevent Lila from marrying the wrong man not Buddy whom Buddy loves also but then this gay subtheme is never explored beyond a drunken kiss. Nothing in this film is explored except maybe its shameless borrowing from Gatsby without a modicum of understanding that his loss was not just of a woman but of a class struggle a dying age and self worth. For Ann it's just Harris.The cars are shiny period antiques the house is beyond the reach of anyone in the audience and the insights into smart women facing loss are none. Thank goodness for the arrival of evening when the real stars are the lights in the firmament not the rich wailing for their lost loves.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see Evening because of the cast. I'd gone to see Norman's Room for that reason  that movie offering Diane Keaton Leonardo De Caprio and also Meryl Streep  and had loved every minute of it. Same for The Notebook even though it was chickflit lite. And my feeling was anything offering performances by Vanessa Redgrave Meryl Streep Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good. Instead I found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite simplistic and  on one occasion  truly offensive material.Now I had no problem with the way the film was structured. I actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story...so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse. But while Vanessa's character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt was a mistake was riveting at times the part actually showing what that past mistake was does nothing to clarify the matter. In fact it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest girl meets boy girl gets boy girl loses boy fashion and in the most unbelievable clichd wrongheaded way possible.And from here be spoilers so bear that in mind should you continue reading.First of all Claire Danes was brutally miscast. Not only does she not even begin to resemble Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting. Don't get me wrong she can be good in the right role  just not this one. And Patrick Wilson was miscast though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off. He'd have been better suited to the part Hugh Dancy played  the rich confused WASP  and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all he's a bit too WASPy for that. Hugh Dancy? One note  I'm a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why. And the why I'm a closet case in a sexually repressed world so I have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone I know was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died as you knew he would because that's the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the Fifties so ludicrous wrongheaded and mishandled I nearly threw my candy at the screen.As for the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister her fear of commitment her jealousy of her sister's perfect life her sister wondering if she's made the right choices her pregnancy and her tooperfect boyfriend which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by Patrick Wilson and Ebon MossBachrach might have been a more interesting Harris given his dreamy eyes  anyway all this was hashed over in the 70's and 80's. And in much greater depth. Do we REALLY have to present it again and all as if it was fresh and momentous?And to top it off Meryl Streep doesn't even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions. She's still good but only because she's Meryl and Meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup.So to put it simply this movie has every clich in the really meaningful message movie book and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out again. At two hours long and laced with Lifetime Movieoftheweek music that is guaranteed to rub you raw it's a complete failure in both the meaningful and moviemaking aspects. I give it 3 only because of Meryl and Vanessa.Now if all you require from your films is twadd le then please set my comments about Evening aside and have the time of your life. But if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings rent Norman's Room and find out what truly great acting is.".

They all pull off their parts to the fullest of course Meryl Streep and Claire Danes do and everyone brings to the movie something on a level of calm refined art.

Meanwhile Ann's daughters the insecure and unstable Nina Mars Toni Collette and the happy wife and mother Constance Haverford Natasha Richardson are worried with their mother and have differences to be resolved.Evening has one of the best feminine casts I have ever seen in a movie with magnificent performances. The resemblance of the stunning Mamie Gummer with her mother Meryl Streep is amazing and she has a performance that honors the name of her mother. The locations costumes set decoration cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome. Unfortunately the plot is confused and I have not clearly understood the message of this film. Why motherhood is so important in the story? Was Constance engendered in the night stand of Ann and Harris and he would be her father? Why Ann and Harris have not stayed together if the guy really loved her like he confesses in their occasional encounter in New York? Which issues Ann Lord has resolved after the visit of Lila Ross? Was Buddy Wittenborn bisexual or his love for Harris was a fraternal love? Why Nina Mars changed her thoughts about motherhood in the end? It seems that the screenplay writers or the director failed since they were not able to make sense and fulfillment to the beautiful love story. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Ao Entardecer In the Eventide".

Claire Danes was the same wigglylipped awkward girl that she was in My SoCalled Life. She has yet to push herself in any way. Girl find a new way to pretend to cry! Meryl Streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie she was on screen for five minutes and I swear to God she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake. Oh! And Hugh Dancy who gets better every time I see him. Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes. I mean this was a wellshot movie it was very pretty the settings were interestingly dressed providing relief for the intense boredom I was feeling. I don't know It's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of The greatest actresses of our time sucks so much. It sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors and the main character Ann was a huge jerk. I was glad she died. But that's because I felt bad for Lila Ann's friend  mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy. Ugh. BAD job Evening the film. You weren't entertaining and you weren't even thoughtprovoking. I sure hope the book was better so it didn't waste even more of people's time. 310".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the trailer for Evening you will probably first think about how great the cast is involved I mean they even got Rocky Horror's own Brad Barry Bostwick to show the world he is still acting and the next second about how they just showed us the entire movie. While not entirely true the film is pretty much summarized nicely in the trailer and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. This is a story about a dying woman who is remembering a time very long ago when she met the love of her lifethe one that got away. Her daughters hear her reminiscing about people they have never heard of and the story of what happened when she and Harris killed Buddy soon plays out. No matter what happens though the film is not about these people and what they do good or bad. It is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life. What may be regret could in fact be the one instance in your life that needed to occur in order for the good times that follow to ever happen.The story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature. Our filmmakers here decide to tell the story by intercutting between the present Ann on her deathbed dreamstate Ann hallucinating by combining the present with the past in her mind and the past Ann meeting Harris at her best friend's wedding. There are a few times where the cuts are a tad abrupt and the progression of the past is so good that you may find the present stuff a bit longwinded and boring but overall it is handled better than at first thought. It's not as though Ann's life now is uninteresting it just has less to do with the plot then it does with the morals being learned. While I grant that the parallels to the past help alleviate the problems for Ann's children currently I was still a bit too enraptured in the wedding to care as much as I maybe should have. There are some nice moments though for instance the crash that awakens Ann from slumber being mirrored later on and the cryptic dreams which bridge both worlds together.It is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid. These performances are completely riveting to the point where you get a bit angry when our time period has changed and we must wait to find out what happens next. No matter how annoying I find Claire Danes' angrysadcrying face that exists in every role she plays the girl is good at what she does. I find myself warming to her talents more and more lately and this one just furthers that thawing. Patrick Wilson is always great in whatever I've seen him in. You must give him credit for picking some really fantastic roles and never doing much more than one film a year. From Angels in America to last year's Little Children the guy will soon blow up but hopefully he will stay true to the craft and not cashin. Heck even Mamie Gummer is good as the younger version of her real life mother Meryl Streep who surprisingly is in the film very little. She is still rough around the edges but she was wonderful at expressing the emotional turmoil her character goes through on her wedding day. The real revelation though is Hugh Dancy. I feel I've seen him in many things but in fact it seems only in King Arthur. Dancy literally steals every scene he is in and the way in which his role of Buddy is devastated by lovealcohollife is etched in his facial expressions throughout. Without his performance the flashback sequences could have fallen into the somewhat forgettable category as the rest of the film and made the experience as a whole much worse.While not wholly original in the ways of what the writers are after Evening does bring intelligence and craft to the table. You may be able to fault the length and amount of cut scenes to tie everything together but you can't argue that the acting isn't worth sticking around for. Maybe a film version of the wedding alone could have been something to see however when it is all put together there may also be something coming out of it that couldn't have been achieved without all the other story threads. Either way the payoff is worth the ride for the most part and each plane of reality finishes with its own subtle beauty and lives up to what had come before it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is without a doubt the most offensive chick flick I have seen in years if not ever. The writing  characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody. Before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster we were subjected to the following themes having a baby will solve all of your problems performer types are miserable messes  musicians can't be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a waste of a talented cast  some greatlooking sets  costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life she'll end up  shudder  alone! I felt queasy. I can't believe this movie made it to theatrical release. It's the sort of fare one expects from those women's cable channels that I always pass right by when channelsurfing. I am female and over 35 so I should be part of this film's target audience but boy does Evening miss its target.".

Yes. I am still here but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours  it seemed a much longer evening than that! I suppose that for Yanks it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach  well next to the beach in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower. If that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film.There's a Monty Python film about a Knight who just won't die. He ends up a wriggling why do Yanks add an third syllable to this word I wonder torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis. This film is also about a sort of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt. She's not worried about having been a wideeyed breathless bimbo but imagines herself a murderess.Obviously being a girlie film there's a chap who is supposed to be the Mr DarcyHeathcliff character. I'm not a woofter so I can't claim to be a good judge of such things but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour. He's a bloodless cypher.As you might gather the main characters aren't much cop but the minor ones manage amazingly to be much worse. There's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers. Fair enough but it isn't the role of Hamlet  why ham it up so badly? Forgetting that it was a girlie film I thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girlfriend would have told him that facefungus didn't flatter him but then I realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a 'beard' because he looked worse without it.I kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery  if you're dragged along to it see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage.Apart from the obligatory wedding there is only one piece of action. You'd have thought that they'd have got it right. Sadly though the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there. When the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby but we do as the audience. If they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him? I suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a halfremembered dream sequence...Another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan. I didn't think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties.".

The best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie. The plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death. The thing is she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy. All the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped. I also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary. It seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the Da Vinci Code in which the device was used to increase suspense or from The Notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the story's main characters. Either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didn't work to create anything. It was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none. I left wondering why good movies can't be written for women. It really was a disappointment.".

And I have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think about Danes she was either horribly miscast or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 Razzie for Worst Actress. I think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her. Instead she is completely unlikeable. The other great actresses do an OK job but certainly don't light up the screen. Out of all the great actresses in this movie I'd say the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the picture and only appears near the very end.Horrible screenplay as well. It comes off more as them reading lines than truly being in character.".

The film uses a narrative device that Tarantino might be proud to steal with Panahi's camera following various women through their specific plights often chasing them through the streets in handheld mode. At any moment the camera may decide to follow a different character and although the specific details of the various women's situations may differ the oppression which is a part of their daily lives is consistently omnipresent. One feature of the film that is part and parcel of its roving camera approach is that there is very little in the way of exposition or denouement in any of the narrative threads. This however seems to be the point of the entire exercise in a society that treats women as a lower class of citizen individual details and circumstances have no bearing on their ability to achieve anything without the presence or authority of a husband or father.veryday occurrences such as the purchase of a bus ticket to the simple act of smoking a cigarette in public can and does result in mandatory incarceration for any woman at any time. The structure of the film gives the impression that literally any woman you might bump into on the streets of Tehran is caught in such a comprehensively prohibitive society that could lead to what could only be considered unconscionable drama in Western society.Although there are no significant male characters in this story Panahi uses the entire gender en masse to illustrate the peculiar double standards that have insinuated itself through the fabric of this society. Men are constantly harassing women with inappropriate lewd remarks to which there can obviously be no response to. Simultaneously if a woman behaves in a manner anything less than perfectly virtuous her liberty is instantly forfeit.In one scene a woman starts to stand up for herself against a casually tossed piece of innuendo and the audience can do nothing except anticipate the unjust retaliation that will surely be endorsed by the dozens of common passersby. There are certain elements of the film that no doubt owe to the nature of making a film under these conditions extras occasionally can't avoid staring at the camera crew but strangely enough this gives the film a feel of documentary filmmaking that somehow enhances the narrative. Nevertheless there is nothing amateurish about the acting of the principal women all of whom behave so convincingly that the film conveys a sense of constant danger. Furthermore this nervous energy never lets up as we move from story to story at a speed that allows us to experience discomfort without reaching closure until the final scene which in itself is a cause for distress.It is unlikely that Dayereh will ever be a very popular film as it has many of the 'feelbad' qualities of films such as A Time For Drunken Horses with even less sympathetic sentimentality. On an even sadder note Dayereh has been banned in Iran where a film of this nature most desperately needs to reach an audience. However this seems to be the underlying message of the film not that there are a great many injustices against women occurring in Iran on a daily basis but that there is no indication of how or when it will stop. Only why.".

I'm reminded of the times I've been in a political conversation with someone and they've said I'm no feminist but... and then said something in defense of women's rights.  Well whether he intended it or not Panahi has made a feminist film because after all feminism in its most basic form has nothing to do with hating men but is merely a desire for the fair and equal treatment of women and equal human rights is of course a cornerstone of humanism.  I'm no scholar and that I can say in all honesty but yes I would say I'm a feminist.  I've never been on a march and I've never read the works of any great feminist theorists but to the core of my soul I believe in the equal and fair treatment of women and if that doesn't make me a feminist I don't know what does.Of course all this discussion about feminism wouldn't matter if The Circle wasn't such a strong film.  Panahi's film almost universally praised will receive no negative criticism here either.  His use of narrative most reviews compare the narrative style to La Ronde 1950 but I suppose comparisons could be made with The Phantom of Liberty 1974 and Slacker 1990 for that matter might be perceived by some rob the characters of their individuality but of course that is part of the point. In Iran today women are all grouped together Panahi is saying and they are seen as no more that a collective problem for men to deal with.

	schema:reviewBody "Iranian director Jafar Panahi's Golden Lion winner of 2000 Dayereh is a critical and extremely powerful film about women who suffer from the injustices of the laws of the Islamic Republic.As an atheist I support no religions and I do not think one is better or more respectful to human lives than any other. Dayereh is a film that is concerned with religion only as far as it is a film that takes place in Iran a country where Islamic Law dominates or even rules over the secular law. I am not an expert on Iranian law but I do hold Dayereh to be the TRUTH not a propaganda fiction of no concern to reality. Therefore I admire Iranian directors who constantly produce magnificent films although they have to battle against censorship and the strict rule of the Ayatollah. This perhaps forces filmmakers to adapt a more poetic film semiotics perhaps only suggesting cruelty and injustice not showing it directly like Western directors are allowed to do.Like Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Abbas Kiarostami before him Jafar Panahi has succeeded in producing a small but superb film. Kambuzia Partovi's script is great linking the misfortune and fates of several young Iranian women together into a whole narrative. All four or five women one is not as thoroughly described have committed unlawful acts but their crimes are not explicitly stated in the dialogue of the film. However we understand that their crimes would not be considered near a crime in most other countries because it is related to sex and female independence not to real criminality. Bahram Badakshani's camera is always close to the women and their acting is nothing less than brilliant. The tracking movement of the camera and the shots composed by a handheld camera result in many long takes where the actresses get to show their skill wihtout editing. This is also a marvellous success for the director Panahi.This film also contains a subtle symbolic factor namely the wish for several of the women to smoke a cigarette. Different interruptions and laws concerning females and cigarettes prevent the women to smoke until one of the last scenes when a women is arrested for travelling alone in a car with a man to whom she is not married prostitution?. When a male prisoner is lighting up his cigarette the woman does the same and this time no one stops her. The smoking of the cigarette is not a symbol of freedom because all the young women end up back in prison but the cigarette does create a symbol of escape although it is an escape from society and not from the persecution of women who act like human beings in Iran read men. The smoking becomes Virginia Woolf's room of their own the escape from a society that does not want them to be free.".

	schema:reviewBody "some potential spoilers belowThis film raised a lot of questions for me...includingWhere was this filmed? It seems in Iran for much of it.Why does Nargess not board the bus at once? Would she still have been subject to the official search that we see from above later? When she purchased that shirt was that to tie her back to the flirtation with the man who earlier was seen decorating the wedding car?Are Iranian doors really so narrow? I'm specifically referring to Pari's house also was it obvious to other viewers that the men that stormed that place after Nargess visits were Pari's brothers??Was that orange soda an Iranian product placement?Okay that last question is not in earnest. I'll take the scourge of crass commercialization over invisible imprisonment but it would be estimable to avoid both as a society ultimately.However my first question stands. For this film to be made partially? in Iran suggests to me a less draconian presence of persecution. Did the actresses and nonactresses all have proper ID cards and clearance themselves? Are the various inquisitors too busy stopping women to peruse the dailies?I have no desire to defend a country wherein clerics get to decide who can and cannot run for office. But in another film I would almost like to see some attempt to show complex characters who do defend the need for ID cards and chaperones and women living in the shadows of their chadors.When I interview Firoozeh Dumas regarding her universally enjoyable book Funny in Farsi I made the mistake of thinking that returning to Iran was prohibitive for her and her IranianAmerican family. She corrected me on that. And I recall Western attitudes about Russia in the 1980's that proved to be misguided or perhaps very truly guided towards misinformation.While I had questions I do think director Panahi is one who invites open questions to this film. His avoidance of back histories to the women featured here helps us to feel as if we are on the lam with them. The handheld camera its shakiness on the large screen I think would pose some trouble for folks like my wife also helped the audience to share the worried nature of the characters.The approach to this film struck me as the approach of an auteur. Thus this film is more likely to stand aside Eisenstein than Weinstein...more likely to be shown at the Pacific Film Archives than the arty upscale multiplex. I do think this will prove to be a favorite in classrooms I get the feeling that Panahi achieved a lot with very little to start with.Women are often shot behind bars cleverly so. At a cinema ticket booth through a hospital window screen outside by a gate. The film starts with a woman screaming in agony and I did not know right away that it was a woman giving birth. It did become clear pretty quickly but as I reflect back it could be that the pain for women is not just confined to labor. The camera travels like a virus from one woman one story at a time. As one other reviewer mentioned this reminded me of Slacker I've not seen La Ronde.I referred to the chadors above while I still don't know a chador from a burkha...there seemed to be different ones worn by different women throughout. I suspect some sort of significance. The allwhite one of  Elham really stood out for me.The contrast of that and her apparent success in getting out of the societal prison she was stuck in  versus the strife her circle of sisters still must endure was stark. As stark as the white versus black garments as stark as the wedding procession that runs blithely through the film and as stark as the footage provided here.I'm glad I saw this...and suspect you will be as well. I look forward to watching more of Panahi's films and hope there will be more artistic exchanges between the U.S. and Iran. Indeed the film I probably want to see would be the one that both governments would like to ban. Has our Attorney General Ashcroft seen any Iranian films that disturbed him recently??710".

	schema:headline " Made interesting and engaging by the anger at the system within each story  but that focus takes away from the narrative";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen several Iranian films in the past few weeks thanks to a short season of the films screened in the UK by Channel 4  a channel that can rise above the level of reality television when it puts its mind to it. Having seen them in a compact space of time I had quickly gotten it in my head that many of those screened had come to international attention and various degrees of acclaim because they were issue films that looked at some aspect of Iranian life with at least a semicritical eye. However none of them came close to the sort of anger with the system that was evident throughout this film.The plot sees several stories that weave around one another to produce a film that looks at several women all of whom are suffering in some way or other due to the general treatment of women in Iran. As a dramatic device it doesn't totally work because too little time is spent with each character to really get to know them or get into their stories and situations but this struck me as being the film's second aim  with the first quite clearly being the injustice with which women are treated. As such the narrative never really engaged me in terms of the people in the story but the general picture painted was interesting enough to hold my attention and make me care for the characters generally even if I would struggle to put names to faces.The actresses are all pretty good and most come off pretty natural and convincing with only the odd moment here and there not really working. They all strike a rather tragic note with each of them trying to make out the best they can in life but really oppressed in so many ways  whether it is small things like not easily moving in the streets by themselves or being rejected by their families to save honour. The direction is good with different styles used for some of the characters  but done in a subtle way to the point where I didn't notice until somebody pointed it out to me.Overall this is a good film but not a brilliant one mainly because the narrative comes secondary to the criticism of the system. However it is worth seeing mainly because without really ranting it holds a lot of anger at the status of Iranian women and their treatment and the injustice within the system  it may not be balanced but it is interesting and engaging.".

You could say that I had big expectations for The Circle.I must admit that halfway through The Circle I wasn't too pleased. So many characters what's the link between them and other questions. Then I saw the light! We don't need to see what happen with the first characters that we get to know in the movie. We know what is happening to them. We know that they're stuck in a society where they're next to nothing. It's somekind of a circle for those women never mind what they seem to try it always come down to the same situation for them.The movie is informative since it shows us the situation of women in the Iranian society. In the last few years we have seen some opening from the Iranian government of Khatami. Hopefully the situation of women will get better even though there's a lot of resistance from the Islam and the men.The acting in this one like in other movies from Iran is excellent. The actors are no superstars and they play their role naturally. The beautiful Fereshteh Sadr Orfani is excellent in the role of the four month pregnant women who's wishing for an abortion since she's not married.The camera work in this one is also good even if it sometimes make you a little dizzy. Just like Scorcese in a few scene of Goodfellas or in The Blair Witch Project the camera is always in movement. We feel like we're part of the action.A film to open the eyes.7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "After making two feature films and many short films on children director Jafar Panahi makes a film The Circle where he deals with the condition of a wider gamut of the female gender a girl child a girl toddler left behind for adoption. a wideeyed teenage girl a pregnant mother whose spouse has been executed a prostitute the only wife of an expatriate doctor the lesspreferred first wife of a husband with two wives a grandmother who wishes for a male grandchild a possibly unmarried mother who can no longer support her girl child in Iran.The circle begins and ends with a name of a womanSolmaz Gholamibeing called out through a door hatch. Interestingly the film never introduces us to this character. It is apparently the name of a woman who has given birth to a girl child. The film introduces us to the grandmother of the child who is informed by the nurse that the newborn is a girl. The hatch belongs to a white door of an operation theater in a hospital.The film ends with the same name being called out from a similar hatch of another doorthis time a prison door of a room that holds most of the female adult characters in the film rounded up for varied offenses. Implicitly the film states that women face discrimination from birth until death in Iran. Evidently someone had stated a white lie earlier that the unseen Ms Gholami was to have a baby boy after an ultrasound test of the foetus. The revised information of the arrival of the girl child upsets the grandmother who wants a boy grandchild.In between the opening of the two hatches the roving handheld camera underlines the state of an unusual group of women in Teheran without IDs or male support evading police and eveteasing males. The viewer is informed that most of the women except the grandmother and two children have either been paroled from prison or have escaped prison and are therefore on the run from the cops. Their original crimes are never stated. One woman is picked up by the police while she is making a call from a public phone booth. Once imprisoned the women are afraid of the blot in their lives to the extent that they hide it from their husbands! Were they imprisoned for sexual offenses? None of the women seem to be politically active. However the film underlines one facthad they either a husband or a father or even a student ID they would have no problem. Some of these women who want to smoke a cigarette. They can only do so when the men in the film a policeman are smoking in public! Mr Panahi is able to present interesting aspects of intrafemale bonding in Iran. Some women travel the extra mile to help other women in distress. Even a prostitute helps another woman to escape the police. Then there are women who do not help others because they do not want their husbands to know that they were once behind bars. A mother leaves her girl child in the street in the hope that a stranger will provide a better life for her child. Yet they do not wallow in self pity. Who are these women with no husbands and having shady pasts? They are definitely not the typical Iranian woman.Any woman or sensitive man could be seduced by the subject of the film. However the film ought to be evaluated beyond the obvious feminist issuesit is a study of individuals born into any society that deprives them of equal privileges. One of the reasons for my argument is that many men shown in the film are caring men who help women in trouble rather than become their exploiters. Some policemen shown are corrupt but some are decent chaps. Many men in the film do respect women. There are also intolerant men who are ready to kill their sister who is pregnant without a husband. The circle cannot be a feminist film merely just because the female form covered in burkhachador indicates repression. The film is more humanist than feministwhich the director has claimed in interviews. One tends to agree with Mr Panahi on this point.However it is a fact that to abort a child in Iran is a difficult proposition as it would be in most countries today. It would be difficult in most countries for any young girl without an ID to take a long distance bus ride all alone in the night. Iranian women enjoy more relative freedom than their counterparts in Saudi Arabiawhere women cannot even drive a car! Panahi's women in The Circle seem to be women who were incarcerated for some unknown crimesnever clearly elucidated in the film except in the case of the prostitute. If they were political prisoners there is no clue except that a pregnant woman states that her spouse has been recently executed for a crime. There is a wide eyed girl who has never seen her village in recent years who makes the viewer wonder why she was imprisoned in the first place. Panahi's film seduces the viewer until you begin to wonder if even the fact that the film was banned in Iran is a viewerseduction tool almost all good Iranian films are banned in Iran even though they have no sex or violence but are possibly remotely critical of the present regime. The film was shot in Teheran and evidently the government did not have any problems at that time with the script. And then bingo it gets banned! The circle is an interesting film that offers considerable fodder for thought. As cinema it is without doubt an intelligent work and deserved the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival. Yet it is a film that calls for close evaluation by an astute mind rather than the heart of an impartial impressionable viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dayereh The Circle made in 2000 by Jafar Panahi takes the hellish universe from his other movies to the extreme. A bunch of women is followed by the camera during one given day. They were out of prison in the morning they are trying to do anything in their power to not come back there they are again in jail at evening. It is not explained how did they come out of prison in the morning it doesn't matter. The movie doesn't show what they are doing all day long it doesn't matter. The camera just leaves one to follow the other and so on glimpses of life.It is not told why they were imprisoned for the first time it doesn't matter. A woman can be arrested there seemingly for anything traveling without being escorted by a male relative or traveling without documents or smoking in public or not having the chador properly arranged or responding improperly when harassed by men or traveling escorted by the wrong man or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Any place can be the wrong place anytime. A woman just gave birth to a daughter and the inlaws were expecting a boy the wrong place at the wrong time. The husband could throw her out on the street with the baby her brothers could not let the woman come back in the home of her parents.There is no main character in the movie just a bunch of women followed randomly by a handheld camera. Women on the run. A perfectly circular universe without possibility of escape. A perfectly crazy universe without fissure. A genially built dystopia. Think at Kafka think at Orwell.Is this the real situation of women in that country? Well it's like asking whether an oppressive regime is really that oppressive. Of course it is not like that for all women it is not like that for many women but that's not the point. Bottom line it's about women at the mercy of a society whose laws institutions and traditions are male centered. Most women know the rules of the game but for any of them there is potentially a wrong place at the wrong time. Is it such a situation only in one country? Only in one totalitarian ideology whether religious or secular? I would let the response to you.".

This is a sad and rather hopeless life that starts with the unwelcome birth of baby girls continues with abandoned girl children and culminates with the limited options and freedom women have in their life. We can watch not only how the tragedies of the the main female characters are unfolding but we can also see the humiliating way women are treated by men in their everyday life. I don't want to fall into the usual ignorant Western attitude towards Islamic societies but this movie was made by Iranians so it seems that even in Iran there are some people who think that something is wrong with the social status of women in their society.I also want to stress that the more I think of this movie the more I like its filmmaking as well the acting is excellent the script is perfect and even fastpaced if you don't expect car races or fist fights as a proof of fastpacedness... every scene adds something new to the story. The film's message is conveyed to the viewer not only via the story itself the photography the closeups and the cutting powerfully strengthens it.".

Dayereh has considerable might in its ways of depicting the problems women could face in Iran and the picture selection is exceptional.

Irene knows that the jealous Charles will never give the divorce to her therefore they decide to stop seeing each other since she does not want to be an unfaithful wife and defy the convention. Andr also decides to move to Paris. One day Irene knows the eighteen yearold college student Pierre Lassalle Lew Ayres in a party during his vacation and she learns that the youngster is infatuated with her. By the end of his vacation Pierre asks a photo for Irene and she promises to give one to him. Meanwhile Charles has a meeting with Pierre's father Lassalle Holmes Herbert and discloses that he is on the verge of bankruptcy. Lassalle promises to help his friend and they schedule a meeting in the night. When Charles goes to the encounter Pierre arrives at his home and asks for a goodbye kiss to Irene. Meanwhile Charles does not feel well and returns home witnessing their kiss. Charles tries to kill Pierre and later the student arrives home and tells his father that Charles is dead. Irene is arrested accused of murdering her husband. What happened in Charles's office? The Kiss is a melodramatic romance and the last MGM and Greta Garbo's silent film and the debut of Lew Ayres. The movie has beautiful shots a mystery and Greta Garbor extremely beautiful. Despite being a silent film MGM uses sound technology with a powerful orchestral soundtrack. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Beijo The Kiss".

As others wrote the Vitaphone soundtrack here was pretty poor except for one section all the melodies have been used before in many silent films. Listening to classical Tchaikovsky is not really appropriate for a modern film like The Kiss.Greta has some great closeups in this film but in certain sections seems to be sleepwalking through her role. Conrad Nagel was a delight to watch he always seemed much more handsome on screen than in his still photos. He is the hero in this film if the film could really be said to have a hero after everyone lies in court.Lew Ayres was adorable and had to have made a great impression on studio bosses when the film was first released for he went straight from this film into his classic All Quiet On The Western Front which made him a star. Holmes Herbert so good in Pola Negri's A Woman of the World here is aged with makeup and plays Lew Ayres' father convincingly. Anders Randolf was a bit jarring as Greta's husband but his performance was fine too.The print was decent on this MGM release compared to another Garbo feature The Single Standard made earlier. But of both films The Single Standard is by far the superior film technically plotwise and in its performances though its print is more worn.".

It was also the final silent film of stars Greta Garbo and Conrad Nagel.The subtle acting and sophisticated and purely visual storytelling show how far silent cinema had come by the late 1920s. When talkies took over Hollywood the acting regressed back to that of the stage the background music was replaced with static hiss and even basic filmmaking techniques were restrained due to the sound equipment. It would take a few years for sound technology to grow in sophistication.Removed from its distinction as the end of an era The Kiss is an average melodrama especially for Garbo who plays an unhappily married woman in love with another man. She looks luminous and acts completely with her eyes her brilliance showing through even in material such as this. Conrad Nagel is competent in an unchallenging role and Lew Ayres is simultaneously adorable and somewhat sinister as the young man smitten with Garbo.The big twist is predictable and the recorded score is cheesy using Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet theme as the lovers' leitmotif but overall this is a skillfully made bit of melodramatic fluff the last gasp of MGM's silent output.".

	schema:reviewBody "This isn't the best Garbo silent ever made but it was the last and it was also the final silent film made by MGM. What makes this film good is the combination of Garbo's acting and the cinematography here. Movies like this and Sunrise make me somewhat sad that the silent film era ended because what could be done creatively with the camera was lost from this point until the early 30's once the problems of the static camera got worked out and the novelty of sound at the expense of everything else wore off.Garbo convincingly plays the sympathetic yet nolongerinlove wife when in the presence of her husband Anders Randolf the longing lover who wishes to defy convention and just leave her marriage behind regardless of the consequences when with Andr Dubail Conrad Nagel and the knowledgeable older woman who is enjoying the attention she is getting when with the very young and naive Pierre Lassalle Lew Ayres. Whenever she is alone she has no trouble conveying which of these three moods she is in. The story is a very good tale of tortured romance with a little bit of mystery thrown in towards the end but the main attractions are the romance and the beautiful and creative shots. The only thing really annoying is the original Vitaphone score that went along with the movie. With all of the other subtle expression going on in this film the choice of the theme song from Romeo and Juliet to convey the feelings between Garbo and Nagel every time they shared a scene just seemed a bit over the top.".

Greta Garbo gives young admirer Lew Ayres a friendly kiss goodbye as he's about to leave town Ayres who cannot control his infatuation with the beautiful Garbo goes in for another less platonic kiss at which point Garbo's husband sees them from afar and goes berserk. A fight amongst the three ensues gets carried into another room where the door is shut to us the audience and we hear a shot. Garbo's husband is dead but who did it? Prior to the kiss moment we've seen Garbo and her lover Conrad Nagel in a torturous romance ... they both love each other madly but Greta doesn't see any way out of her loveless marriage. In the meantime Lew Ayres follows Greta around like a puppy dog he's an 18yearold completely infatuated with the beautiful married lady.The latter half of the movie deals with the investigation of the husband's death Greta's arrest and her trial where she is defended by Nagel who in addition to being her former lover is also a lawyer.I won't give away the outcome of the trial but I will say that the jury believes it is Person A who did it and after the trial we learn it was Person B.The musical score to this flick was absolutely horrible. I especially could have done without the Romeo and Juliet theme that was played every time the flick wanted to telegraph Greta's and Conrad's love to the audience.Despite the score this was a very enjoyable silent movie. I find some silents tedious others quite well done. The Kiss definitely falls into the latter category. Worth watching.".

His tennis match with her at her home has her playfully leaping about laughing and being his friend too.

	schema:reviewBody "I've got to admit up front that I have long felt that Greta Garbo was a bit overrated as an actress. All too often she was stuck in supermelodramatic films involving either adultery or with Garbo playing an irresistible supervamp. While the public loved this persona the films seemed quite derivative and clichd. There are only so many films like this you can watch until they blend together.Fortunately she also made some dandy films like NINOTCHKA QUEEN Christina and THE KISS. While superficially the film seems just like another adultery film Garbo was given better materialas she was a woman who WANTED to commit adultery but couldn't bring herself to cheat on her much older husband. I'm glad the film didn't pursue this expected plot line but instead the film is about the consequences when the husband THINKS she's cheating on him when she isn't. This led to a dandy finale where there is a nice plot twist.Overall this film excelled because Garbo did NOT stare in a pained way into space as she so often did in films where she played a married woman trapped in a loveless marriage. Here she plays a more believable and wellrounded personalitysomeone who seemed much more human than the usual Garbo character.With good production values and only one minor problem a repetitive and sappy soundtrack this is well worth a look.".

	schema:headline " Garbo's Image";
	schema:reviewBody "In star Greta Garbo's silent films especially I think the stories are secondary to the images. They tend to be similarly melodramatic romances about adultery and love triangles and the surrounding scandals and tragedies. This one is more of a love rectangle with Garbo's husband and the characters played by Conrad Nagel and Lew Ayres all trying to possess her. It's a generic formula especially for the vehicles of MGM's star Garbo. Yes there's a mystery element but that's none too appealing either. There's even dinnerparty and courtroom scenes and of course her husband is an old rotund businessman. The title cards are gushy and the musical score including the love theme from Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet is unoriginal. Yet the narrative does focus in some interesting and different ways on Garbo's image and this is yet another lovelylooking late silent film as Garbo's 1920s MGM productions tend to be. It's fortunate that Garbo with her foreign accent was the last of the studio's stars to transition to talkiesthis being the last silent film of both Garbo and MGMbecause they're some of the most deliberately gorgeous pictures of the era. They're far superior to the awkward early talkies concurrently being made by others.Appropriately The Kiss begins with Garbo and one of her lovers in a French art gallery from there the film itself is a piece of visual art. Much of that is the glossy closeups of Garbo's face but there's an emphasis on shots of her walking and riding away from men in this one too. There are several overhead establishing shots superimposed images and dollyshot transitions. The best moving camera shot is in the assault scene with the camera pulling back after the door closes. The gunshot and phone ringing are also a better use of sound effects than in most contemporary talkies. There are two flashback scenes of this incident as narrated or imagined by Garboone is a lie and the other presumably is the truth. Both are filmed differently and from different angles than the the first instance. The Art Deco sets are impressive toomainly for Garbo's home. The abstract skyscrapers design on her bedroom wall is a standout. Additionally there's the motif of Garbo's image Ayres wants a photograph of her the newspapers print her image the courtroom artists draw it while the overall film and machinery of MGM's star making focuses on creating it. In this case that machinery is partly of European imported artists including Garbo herself the director and the writer. The transition to talkies would surrender much of such foreign talent although fortunately not Garbo.With about an hour runtime this is a relativelybrief feature and taut. For instance when the husband has his wife tailed it's to establish his jealous suspicions which are sure to foreshadow later events. And when we're shown Chekhov's gun expect it to be fired by the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Greta Garbo films I consider each one of them highly entertaining and worth seeking out. The Swedish beauty could captivate the viewer in many of her roles to such extend that she was as popular in movie world as much later the Swedish band ABBA was in music world. Yet when I talk to people who are quite knowledgeable about the early cinema I usually encounter the opinion that Garbo films let them down. She was such a dramatic lady they say she can still make us cry. Strange as it may occur to some extend this pretentious opinion may be found accurate particularly when we consider the year 1939 and Garbo's first comedy NINOTCHKA made by Ernst Lubitsch. What a change what a revelation it was! A true transformation some said and indeed NINOTCHKA proved Garbo's talent in comedy unfortunately forever bound to fail two years later in TWO FACED WOMAN. But few people know that Garbo had wonderfully modern roles in some other films roles that can still make your day thanks to their charm and convincing portrayals. One of such films is THE KISS with original musical score the last silent movie of Garbo and MGM directed by Jacques Feyder with whom Garbo worked later on the German version of Anna Christie with Salka Viertel. The uniqueness of THE KISS is the fact that it is very different from all other Garbo films.The kiss of 'good bye' that cost Irene Guarry Greta Garbo so much which was metaphorically Garbo's farewell to silents is the representation of all human struggles and desires. Simple as the short story may seem when you watch the film carefully you realize that the director aimed at conveying some important and a very uptodate message for all of us Listen to your heart not the tyrants of conventions and misery of duties... There is a bit of everything in the story wit romance jealousy pardoning... Consider for instance the sequence at the court where we get the masterwork of human situation individual situation in the mute world.The film can boast terrific artistic merits with scenes of exceptional charm. Here a mention must be made of the party at Lasalle which again proves the glamor of the silent era. But most things we can appreciate here are there thanks to the Swedish Sphinx... Garbo. The great Greta gives another brilliant performance in the lead but as it has already been mentioned her role differs from other of her silent roles in the way that Irene Guarry appears to be a particularly modern character as well as her story appears to be extremely appealing to modern audience. It is not as much her vehicle as the story which captivates certain viewers. That however does not mean that we easily forget the great actress whose presence illumines the moments and supplies them with unique power. There are exceptional shots of Garbo's face. Consider for instance the moment she looks at herself in the mirror. Perhaps not as great as the ultra famous moment in FLESH AND THE DEVIL but also highly worth attention. What a great beauty she was! So to speak THE KISS is a very important movie in both Garbo's career and the history of MGM. It occurs to be a great farewell to the silent era an interesting look at life situation filled with the affection that any kiss deserves... And for Garbo fans somewhere there in the world a different look at the famous Swede yet unique and magnetic as always.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE KISS MetroGoldwynMayer 1929 directed by Jacques Feyder goes on record as the last silent movie for both the studio and its popular leading lady Greta Garbo. Released near the close of the year when talkies were the talk or in other words the rage of the movie business MGM took a gamble on continuing on making product of silent movies that's now considered pass and keeping the Swedish temptress from appearing in a talkie until finally Garbo Talks in the highly popular ANNA Christie 1930. What's even more common up to this point was casting Garbo as an unfaithful woman married to a middleaged man involved with one closer to her own age. For THE KISS two young men screen veteran Conrad Nagel and newcomer Lew Ayres. While MGM might have placed the versatile Lewis Stone as the older husband having done so with Garbo in WILD ORCHIDS 1929 Anders Randolf became the final choice. He acts his part with further conviction than Stone would have if he played the part. For a ordinary story by George M. Seville that could have taken place anywhere from New York to Tahiti the setting for THE KISS is in Lyons France. It's uncertain if the leading players are characters of French descent but if so maybe it's a good thing that THE KISS is a silent film since it's a hard to imagine the Swedish Garbo speaking with a French accent? As for the screenplay credited to Hans Kraly the story opens at the Museum of Fine Arts where Irene Guarry Greta Garbo is meeting secretly with Andre Dubail Conrad Nagel her lover. Andre wants Irene to divorce her husband Charles Anders Randolf a silk merchant whose business prevents him from giving his wife the full attention she desires. Fearing of his jealous nature if the two men should meet and unable to come up with a possible solution Irene and Andre decide to part company. Returning to her usual lifestyle and social functions Irene attends one given by her husband's business partner Lassalle Holmes Herbert whose 18yearold son Pierre Lew Ayres has a crush on her. Suspecting Irene to be unfaithful Charles hires Durant George Davis a detective to trail her. During the investigation Durant finds Irene constantly in the company of Pierre in reality to be all very innocent. One night while Charles to assist Lassalle whose on the verge of bankruptcy Pierre comes over to visit with Irene who had promised him a picture of herself to take with him upon his return to school. Discovering they are alone Pierre forces himself on Irene with a passionate kiss at the very moment Charles returns to catch them together. As the irate husband beats the frightful youth senseless Irene suddenly grabs her husband's revolver and off camera fires a shot. Because the police find contradictions in her story Irene is arrested to later face a murder trial with her former lover Andre as her attorney.An acceptable melodrama of the soapopera school made interesting by its lengthy courtroom climax consisting of various points of views told via flashback depicting what occurred the night of the murder. Aside from such notable camera angles and stylish sets along with added sound effects of the telephone ringing and a gunshot noise there's also wonder what secret Irene is holding back from her attorney and what the verdict will be a common practice in many trial stories.While THE KISS is sometimes credited at 89 minutes circulating prints available either on the old 1990s VHS format or on cable television's Turner Classic Movies have the running time of 62 minutes which obviously was the one distributed in theaters since there seems to be no indication of severe editing nor sudden fadeouts. Containing a musical track conducted by Dr. William Axt its only drawback is its repetitious use of Tschiakowski's love theme composition for Romeo and Juliet. Other than that this is typical Garbo of the 1920s that should still be of some interest today and the film for which she kisses goodbye to the art of silent movie making.".

Aside from such notable camera angles and stylish sets along with added sound effects of the telephone ringing and a gunshot noise there's also wonder what secret Irene is holding back from her attorney and what the verdict will be a common practice in many trial stories.While THE KISS is sometimes credited at 89 minutes circulating prints available either on the old 1990s VHS format or on cable television's Turner Classic Movies have the running time of 62 minutes which obviously was the one distributed in theaters since there seems to be no indication of severe editing nor sudden fadeouts. Containing a musical track conducted by Dr. William Axt its only drawback is its repetitious use of Tschiakowski's love theme composition for Romeo and Juliet. Other than that this is typical Garbo of the 1920s that should still be of some interest today and the film for which she kisses goodbye to the art of silent movie making.";

	schema:reviewBody "I often see stills from this movie accompanying articles about art direction of the 1920s. Stressing the claustrophobic ceilings and the pointed triangular furniture where Irene Garbo lives with her husband Anders Randolph with whom she is caught in a loveless marriage the extreme surroundings mirror their tense lives. MGM embraced the stark modernistic Art Deco style their films were always aimed at the wealthier members of the audience or the poor audiences that envied the rich. The average MGM family of the 20s were usually wealthy who lived in a mad whirl of parties often taking place on yachts Our Dancing Daughters is a good example.In my opinion along with A Woman of Affairs this is my favourite Garbo film. It was her last silent  released late in 1929 and once again she gave a strong mesmerizing performance even though the men in the movie Conrad Nagel Anders Randolph Lew Ayres lacked dynamism and at just over an hour an extraordinarily short running time for a Garbo film.Irene Garbo is having a very discreet affair with Andre Nagel she begs him to take her away but he is concerned for her reputation and wants to confront her husband blustering quick tempered Charles Anders Randolph  yes Anders Randolph  how did that ever happen was she in a daze until their honeymoon!!!  who is not above having Irene tailed!! The only thing of interest the trailer has in his book is the amount of time Irene spends with young Pierre Ayres who just happens to be her messenger boy and dog handler. Unbeknownst to everyone Pierre is infatuated with Irene. Charles is on the verge of bankruptcy but LaSalle Pierre's father offers to bail him out however on the way to the meeting Charles suffers a slight heart attack and instructs his driver to return home. He walks right in on a playful kiss between Irene and Pierre but by the end of the evening Charles is dead and Pierre has staggered home dishevelled and bloody.The last part of the movie has a couple of innovative sequences. When Irene is questioned by the detectives she is hesitant and changes her story but the viewer sees it in flashback  are the windows open no they are closed what time was it  the clock hands go haywire and instead of 9.30 pm it is now 9.10 pm  she constantly stumbles recollects and fabricates. At the trial Andre has returned to represent her her stark black Adrian designed hat almost turns her into an Art Deco decoration as she is photographed from below sitting in the witness box.Lew Ayres made a spontaneous eager Pierre. He was a protg of Paul Bern and had had a bit part in The Sophomore but when Bern moved to MGM he thought of Lew for the role of the youthful Pierre in The Kiss.".

Interestingly these vampires differ somewhat from the type we've all come to know and love in that they have a fondness for ordinary food and wine and can walk about during daylight hours...as long as it's fairly cloudy outside. Still they remain averse to garlic and definitely suffer from uh crucifixaphobia. But this film offers us much more than just a group of atypical neck noshers. Kiss has been beautifully photographed boasts some truly striking sets an ornate coffin Ravna calls his sumptuous home and features a literate script and fine acting from its relatively noname cast. There are also several impressive sequences Ravna's son Karl playing his eerily dreamy piano composition a flaminghand cauterization following a vampire's kiss a vampire masquerade ball and perhaps the best pentagramconjuration scene ever shown on film...at least until The Devil Rides Out came along in 1968. And without giving anything away let me just say that the vampires are undone in this film in a manner I have never seen before. From its deliciously morbid vampirefuneral opening to its perhaps too abrupt conclusion this concise little picture is still another winner from the great House of Hammer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably the most important aspect of Hammer Horror for me is the colour scheme. At their best Hammer films are painted like no other and it gives the films a very distinct style. The Kiss of the Vampire has the best colours of all Hammer films  it's astounding how great this film looks. The sets are lavishly designed the costumes are magnificent and on the whole  the film looks exactly how you want Hammer Horror to look. This sort of style really deserves an equally great story to go with it...but in a missed opportunity of epic proportions Hammer haven't been able to script as well as they've proved with earlier and later films that they can and the result is a visually dazzling film with a severely underwhelming story. That's not to say that the story is bad essentially just not very good. We follow a honeymooning couple who take a wrong turn and end up in a strange little village. This soon attracts the attention of the most important man in the village and the pair are soon invited to dine with him. However he's also the leader of a vampire cult and he wants more than just to have them for dinner...The main problem where the plot is concerned isn't necessarily the story  as that's classic vampire stuff  but rather in the way that it's handled. It just goes too slow and while this gives you time admire the scenery I want a little more stimulation than that. It takes ages to get going and it isn't really until the last half hour that it picks up properly. It's nice when it does but really it's too little too late. The ending is very nice however and the effects are typical Hammer and therefore very much enjoyed by me. The Kiss of the Vampire doesn't feature any of Hammer's big stars. This shouldn't really harm it but it does. Part of what makes many Hammer films work is the fact that there's a centrepiece actor that you can admire even when the plot isn't too good. This film doesn't have that and while the cast of lesserknown actors do their collective best to keep the film interesting there isn't one unique enough to really take the reins. There's still a lot to like here however and despite the low points with the plot The Kiss of the Vampire never actually becomes boring. Just make sure you see the likes of The Vampire Lovers and Twins of Evil first.".

Note that the entire village seems to consist of only three people Professor Zimmer the innkeeper and the innkeeper's wife. There's the Hammer casting budget for you!Thankfully the action picks up during the creepy masquerade ball. I also enjoy watching our hapless hero played by the somehow likable Edward DeSouza get humiliated by the vampires when he attempts to rescue his wife.The sets are cool and Gothic if obviously studiobound this is the kind of movie that many would call cheap but tolerant and loving horror fans would probably describe it as quite lavish.I have some plotrelated problems. Professor Zimmer's transformation from tottering drunkard to knowitall savior is too abrupt and unconvincing. I can't understand why he doesn't stop the Harcourts from visiting Ravna since he's so sure that the latter is a vampire. All he does is issue cryptic warnings  who's that going to put off? I also don't understand why the vampires try to convince de Souza that he never had a wife. Do they really think that trick's going to work? Of COURSE he knows he had a wife! They really should just kill or convert him setting him loose to make trouble is an unconscionably stupid decision. Anyway they drop this little lie so quickly that one wonders why they bothered in the first place.Other problems include a scene involving whiny panicking vampires hardly the most terrifying villains and the strange lack of music in the climatic scene. As usual for a horror film certain casual asides in the dialogue are more interesting than the story itself Zimmer describes his daughter's conversion into a vampire in the most fascinating terms and even suggests that vampires can be redeemed through faith in God. All of which amounts to nothing of course since Hammer films can never be too deep. What we get is the usual fight over a pretty girl the staple of vampire movies for way too many years.Groaning aside all Hammer films do have a certain charm including the slow ones. A worthwhile attempt is made to make the vampires seem elegant and mysterious and their eerie piano song does add to the atmosphere. I just wish the movie held up a little better with a rewrite and some nips and tucks this could've been one of the greats. Alas as it stands it's merely mediocre.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't enjoy Kiss of the Vampire quite as much on this most recent viewing but it's still a decent film. The biggest asset is probably that infamous and somewhat ineffable and inimitable Hammer Films atmosphere. But there are quite a few flaws including a largely simplistic story in combination with a lack of depth in characterization and some laughably cheesy special effects.It's probably best to watch this film with zero knowledge of the plot. I believe that's part of why I didn't enjoy it as much on this viewingI could remember too well what was going to happen. Of course with a title like Kiss of the Vampire and with an opening scene that leaves even less doubt about the eventual subject matter it might be difficult for the film to be a complete surprise to anyone but the pacing and twists are aided by a lack of knowledge.But for those who must know the premise here it is Gerald Edward de Souza and Marianne Harcourt Jennifer Daniel are newlyweds from the U.K. who are traveling through the backroads of Germany on their honeymoon. Gerald takes a wrong turn but probably because Marianne is reading the map wrong. In any event they end up stuck on a lonely country road without petrol. Gerald goes to get help and eventually they find their way to an oddly deserted Grand Hotel.Shortly after checking in they see a coach arrive out front to deliver a letter. It is curiously addressed to them written by one Count Ravna Noel Willman inviting them to dinner. Afterwards Gerald and Marianne are warned by the gruff Professor Zimmer not to return to Ravna's chteau but the couple is enticed to a masked ball. This leads to a strange sort of seduction and nice twist and of course eventually to a big blowout in the climax.Hammer had a knack for creating marvelously eerie almost otherworldly atmospheres especially set in the daytime. How this was achieved exactly would take a lot of hard research and analysis but it probably had to do with their locations the film stock and processing methods of the era their approach to production design and of course their producers and directors. But like Universal Studios horror in the 1930s and 1940s Hammer is good fodder against the auteur theory even though I buy a modified more complex version of auteur theory as there is a remarkable consistency of tone and atmosphere regardless of who was in the driver's seat. In this case the helmer was Don Sharp. This was his debut film for the studio. He later did The DevilShip Pirates 1964 Rasputin The Mad Monk 1966 and the Guardian of the Abyss episode of The Hammer House of Horror 1980.Whatever the source the atmosphere in Kiss of the Vampire is fantastic. Although oddly the atmosphere is best in the earlier reels. The opening scene is reminiscent of the graveyard opening of James Whale's Frankenstein 1931 but with a vampiric twist. The atmosphere is only as good as that again when Gerald and Marianne first arrive at the hotel. Sharp has the stereotypical howling wind and banging shutters but because of the otherwise bright daytime setting it doesn't seem clichd. And when the newlyweds are first checking into the hotel we're given even more delectable creepiness. All of the furniture is covered up with white sheets as it would be if someone had died. When the innkeepers remove the coverings there are thick clouds of dust blown about.The period settingKiss of the Vampire is set in the late 19th or early 20th Centuryhelps the atmosphere as well. The costume design is fantastic. Ravna's Gothic chteau the stereotypical spooky castle on the hill fits naturally into this milieu.The cast does well with the material they're given. Gerald and Marianne are played so they are very likable. Ravna and his offspring Carl Barry Warren and Sabena Jacquie Wallis are oddly charismatic as is Tania Isobel Black. And Zimmer is a spartan fanatical and a somewhat dislikable antihero.However we don't get to know nearly as much about these characters as we'd like to. Of course that need not hurt a horror filmhow many are known as great character studies?but the plot is relatively simple and straightforward which can make Kiss of the Vampire seem slow at least until we arrive at the hour mark and enter the last third of the film. Half of the first hour or a third of the film is consumed by the two parties at Ravna's chteau. These work somewhat but they're not particularly horrific. The eeriest event in the first one is the extremely out original piano piece that Carl plays for entertainment. The most peculiar thing about it is that no one remarks on its bizarreness.In the second party the focus is the seduction. It's not a literal seduction exactly but it is suggestive of sex and in many ways Kiss of the Vampire can be seen as a parable about unusual sexual practices. Ravna's home could very well be seen as playing host to regular orgies partner swapping and such. Zimmer's later speech is that of a conservative Christian against such perversions. That's why Ravna seems more enticing than evil to the audience as well. For the most part the horror aspects are severely downplayed here to emphasize the metaphorical reading.The last halfhour features a nice twist but one that isn't carried through very vehemently. It only lasts for about 15 minutes. This twist would have been better as the focus of the film. Still it is enjoyable and leads to a very memorable if not exactly effective climax that features a horde of bats on strings and lots of writhing flesh.Any vampire film fans should enjoy this film somewhat and it's a must see for Hammer fans of course.".

Of course that need not hurt a horror filmhow many are known as great character studies?but the plot is relatively simple and straightforward which can make Kiss of the Vampire seem slow at least until we arrive at the hour mark and enter the last third of the film. Half of the first hour or a third of the film is consumed by the two parties at Ravna's chteau. These work somewhat but they're not particularly horrific. The eeriest event in the first one is the extremely out original piano piece that Carl plays for entertainment. The most peculiar thing about it is that no one remarks on its bizarreness.In the second party the focus is the seduction. It's not a literal seduction exactly but it is suggestive of sex and in many ways Kiss of the Vampire can be seen as a parable about unusual sexual practices. Ravna's home could very well be seen as playing host to regular orgies partner swapping and such. Zimmer's later speech is that of a conservative Christian against such perversions. That's why Ravna seems more enticing than evil to the audience as well. For the most part the horror aspects are severely downplayed here to emphasize the metaphorical reading.The last halfhour features a nice twist but one that isn't carried through very vehemently. It only lasts for about 15 minutes. This twist would have been better as the focus of the film. Still it is enjoyable and leads to a very memorable if not exactly effective climax that features a horde of bats on strings and lots of writhing flesh.Any vampire film fans should enjoy this film somewhat and it's a must see for Hammer fans of course.";

	schema:headline " Not much horroreven for a Hammer film";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not going to rehash the plot of the movie because that has been done by most of the earlier reviews. I'm going to just touch on what I think workedand what I think didn't. In terms of the atmosphere cinematography etc. I think they did a good job. It had the foreboding eerie set up for the most part. Also from this point things might get a little spoilery.There were so many things they did in this movie IMO that they really didn't set up properly. This movie is definitely formulaicand I'm not criticizing it for that. What I am going to find fault with though is leaving part of the formula out. 19th century husband leaves his new wife sitting in their useless motorcar because they ran out of gas and he needs to go get help. OK. It's also not necessarily bad that she got uncomfortable and decided to try and catch up with hubby at least if they had bothered to have something unsettling happen before she decided to get outbut they didn't. Stuff happened after she got out of the car. Of course part of this was so she could run into the stern Professor fellow who gave her a cryptic warning which of course also did not help calm her already frayed nerves. Another thing I found out of sync was the inn. It seemed like it was designed to be the Ritz of small Bavarian inns but why? I don't know if we were supposed to deduce that the village once was more prosperous and merited such an establishment but it seemed out of place. It would be like finding a deserted town in the Nevada desert that still had a fancy Hilton hotel there welcoming whatever guest might wander in which is pretty much what happened here. Also the innkeeper moderated from seeming happily oblivious to what was going on to being complicit even if they were being coercedand I think that was certainly implied.The wife's behavior became more understandable once they showed the scene where she was grieving over her daughtera scene which I thought was very effective and probably the best acting in the whole movie. Even the main couple's faces expressed their understanding that they had almost intruded on a private sad moment as they quietly withdrew to leave the poor women to grieve. Speaking of the main couple they were naturally happily naive. The man of course was one of meansinherited naturally. He wasn't a snobby sort though he certainly had no problem with the local uppityups recognizing his obvious value and integrity sight unseen. Again this isn't necessarily something that was unrealistic in terms of the upperclass being perhaps as too trusting when dealing with someone they have assumed is also upper class.Let me skip on to what I found was the biggest flaw in the showand that was how ho hum the bad guysand galswere. The predecessor to this movie was I believeat least in terms of vampire moviesBrides of Draculaand I found the vampire in that to be more intimidating even with his fake fluffy red wig and foppish appearancethan most of the vamps in this movie. It was almost laughable when the hero managed to grab his wife and run out of a whole room full of vampireswith almost none of them in pursuit except their one I assume human lackey. We in the audience needed much more exposition as to why this Drac wannabe had a castle full of other vampires who seemed to have nothing better to do than to either quiver in fear for various reasons or carp at their master. I mean the village was supposedly pretty deserted so who was left for this house full of vampires to victimize and feed on? Even the visitors to the countryside were supposed to be rare and the two naive victims had made a wrong turn to start with to end up out of gas in the middle of some obscure Bavarian forest. The one actor who did a decent job IMO was the Van Helsing typeProfessor Zimmerman. In what screen time he was given he managed to convey that he wasn't just a grumpy drunkbut that there was a good reason he was the way he was as well as a method to his madness.Last but not least I feel the climax could have been done much better. I saw it mentioned that for some reason they decided not to release this movie around the same time as the famed Hitchcock movie The Birdsnot because Hammer didn't want to compete with that moviethough that certainly would make sensebut because of the similar mindblowing event. I can see the slight similarity but the Hitchcock film did not shy away from showing as much as they were allowed by the movie codes how gruesome being attacked by a huge flock of birds could be. Likewise this movie could have added to the discomfortand certainly the horrorif they had portrayed like The Birds at least as much as possibletaking into consideration the aforementioned codes and the Hammer budgeta much more mutilated bunch of vampires being chowed down on I assume by a horde of vampire batsthe irony not supposed to be lost on we the audience. This was just about as toothless in terms of scares a vampire movie was I have ever seenand I've seen a bunch at my age.".

It's a shame he didn't come back for this one because one of the very few weak points in this film is the fairly unmenacing Dr Ravna chief vampire played rather insipidly by Noel Willman.The film opens with one of Hammer's usual strong prologues as we follow a funeral procession that is overlooked by a sinister looking figure standing on high. I won't spoil things for those who have yet to see the film suffice to say firsttime Hammer director Don Sharp handles the proceedings exceedingly well instantly plunging the viewer into that classic atmosphere of brooding menace and Gothic feel that Hammer did so well.After the titles we are in the familiar territory of stranded newlyweds scared villagers albeit only two of them and a village overlooked by a Gothic mansion housing the youknowwhat. But if there's one thing that Hammer were good at was recycling old plots and giving them an injection of something fresh. The film trundles along at a somewhat leisurely pace compared to others but is no worse off from itin fact the slow build up of tension works well.One of the more interesting aspects of the film are the way the vampires are portrayed. These aren't the superhuman nighon indestructible vampires of old but a more vulnerable although just as evil type. Dr Ravna lives in the mansion with his two children all vamps and is surrounded by many acolytes. With their being very few 'bitings' and hardly any blood on show and also the way the acolytes act this is more of a religious cult than a nest of vampires. In fact Professor Zimmer even describes losing his daughter to them as 'she fell in with a bad crowd'.As you can imagine the new bride is soon one of the followers ensnared at a particularly effective masquerade ball and it's up to Professor Zimmer and the husband to rescue them setting the scene for the final showdown which again is faultlessly done. Chalked pentagrams high winds and swarms of bats bring a memorable climax to yet another top notch Hammer. Special effectswise the bats are done in the usual crappy way but then again they always are and I can forgive that. Highly recommended.".

However it does have to contend with the Hammer legacy and being part of the Hammer cannon. It is fairly pedestrian by Hammer standards and is badly wounded by the absence of Lee Cushing Gough et al.There are two sequences in my mind which make this film worth watching. The first is during the middle part of the film. the group of vampires weave a conspiracy and try to convince the husband that he's delusional and living in a fantasy world. The wife he claims to have never actually existed. His growing sense of panic and self doubt is effective and hey how can you not be pulling for him to discover the truth? The second part and pay dirt for this film is the ending  originally intended for Brides of Dracula. Although the effects are dated and I would argue unintentionally funny initially they do the job satisfyingly. Likely a bit more frightening for contemporary audiences the ending here is grim brutal and drawn out.Overall this film isn't bad. For me it has genre issues. Even if one were only to count it among Hammer vampire films it would fit somewhere in the bottom third. Certainly better than the wretched 'Dracula A.D. 1972' but weaker than 'Brides of Dracula.' It IS a good use of an hour and a half and perhaps not a bad introduction to what Hammer would do better in other films.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to Leonard Maltin the version of this film shown in the United States was severely truncated. Fortunately Hammer Films recently released an eight film set The Franchise Collection that included the full version of THE KISS OF THE VAMPIRE. This review is based on this original longer version.A young married couple run out of gas in some godforsaken portion of Europe that appears to be Germany or Hungary or some such place. There is an inn nearby and all but one of the rooms are empty. In fact they are the first new guests in what could be years. So they're stranded there for who knows how longin the middle of nowhere. Then out of the blue a man they don't even know invites them to his house for a lovely dinner. Dr. Ravna is a nice host and the couple have a nice time with him and his two grown children.A few days later the couple are invited back for a masquerade party. However at the party the wife is kidnapped and attacked by Ravnawho turns out to be a vampire running some sort of weird vampire cult. When the husband who had been drugged awakens he's thrown out of the mansion and everyone denies having any knowledge of his wife!! So here he's stuckin the middle of nowhere with no way to locate his wife.This is a very unusual vampire film because some of the usual vampire lore is present and some isn't. For example the vampires are very much light sensitive but they CAN come out during the day provided it's overcast. Also while crosses and garlic indeed have great power over these undead jerks instead of a Draculalike vampire they have Ravna who is leader of a cult of beautiful people who are more akin to Satan worshipers than vampires. Plus the way they are defeated in the end is one of the weirdest I've ever seen.Still despite all the differences this is a dandy filmwith an excellent DVD transfer good acting and a script that has a lot of neat twists. If you're looking for a Draculalike film then you may be disappointed but if you don't mind the changes this is well worth your time.FYIThe guy who plays Ravna looks for all the world like what you'd expect Peter Cushing's brother to look likethe similarity is quite striking. I assume Hammer knew that and that was why he was chosen.".

Watching it it doesn't take long to figure out some possible reasons why. For starters the story of the movie is for the most part made up of various clichd situations we have seen in many other horror movies before. It starts off with a honeymooning couple getting stuck in the countryside where they are soon invited by a mysterious stranger for dinner at his mansion and eventually the husband finds that his bride has disappeared and he can't convince authorities that the stranger had something to do with the disappearance... Must I go on with telling that story? Well actually I guess the familiar story could have worked again had the filmmakers tried hard enough to liven things up. But except for a kind of silly climax which I will not reveal there's not much life in this telling. The biggest problem is that this familiar story is stretched out past the breaking point. For example the husband does not find that his bride has disappeared until more than half the movie has gone by.The production values aren't bad and there is some decent acting on display so the movie isn't a total loss. All the same I think that most modern day viewers will find this movie very routine and tired. I would only recommend it to serious Hammer fans.".

The film's best part is the opening which is classic as the funerary procession done in Latin through the foggy graveyard is quite impressive and soon turns over into the staking which is a gruesome twist that is nicely done the blood flow from the coffin is all the better and makes the event seem all the more creepy and impressive. That it segues into a nice scene where a couple is attacked by a supernatural windgust while out in the woods featuring all manner of howling winds and perfectlytimedtojustmiss branches in their path allows for a grand opening that works well. There's tons of good stuff as well with how this one builds upon the mystery about the inhabitants of the castle and their secret group as the events of their first encounter over dinner meeting everyone with just an air of strangeness to them before it starts in on the wonderfully welldone changeover of her being tricked into going with their intentions over him and aided nicely with the efforts of those around to further their ruse. That carries nicely from the rather nicely done costume party which here comes across as something that is really interesting and fun features some really great action and suspense into it that holds this up and the subsequent rescue provides plenty of fun and surprises most notably the different attempts that it uses is something to enjoy. The last part that works here is the ending as not only is the main attack using black magic and necromancy a novel take on the genre that's something to enjoy but the vampire bat attack on the congregation is a lot of fun especially as it's a long drawnout battle that has a lot of good stuff to it seeing the bats fly around the large lavish castle feeding on the cult. It's really a lot of fun and helps to make the film interesting but it does have a few problems. The main one here is the lethargic and absolutely maddening pace this employs to get absolutely anywhere. The fact that the vampire cult is introduced at the very end then gets rushed through to provide the climax is something just proves that there's some really huge faults with how this one is paced. It's not that there's an eternity that happens between something but it's also the fact that it feels the need to do so with nary any form of excitement passed along through the event. That's the main fault in here with that since it manages to make the events seem unimportant and it's just a really terrible feel to have from a film. As well the setup is a little clichd and this results in the film also giving off a really familiar feel that can ruin it by not having the best feeling when repeated viewing. The main thing though is the fact that this one is just superslow and really dull.Today's RatingPG Violence.".

And then her difficult personality got in the way and Oliver Stone fired her from Wall Street in which she was to have a major part then her alleged relationship with former costar James Woods and subsequent Fatal Attractionstyle antics against him in addition to her amusingly disturbing allout efforts to snag the role of 'Catwoman' in the first sequel to Batman seemed to have a snowball effect effectively curtailing her trajectory and reducing her to such projects as Dr Jekyll and Ms Hyde and numerous directtocablevideo duds. While A Kiss Before Dying has a much better pedigree than Dr Jekyll and Ms Hyde ever could thanks in part to being based on a solid little Ira Levin book and blessed with at least two respected actors Diane Ladd and Max Von Sydow it too is a neartotal failure and Sean Young is sadly a major factor as to 'why'. With a strong director and viable material she has proved to be a good actor and oddly charismatic even when the film didn't warrant it see Blade Runner. She was never a GREAT actress mind you but had an unmistakable appeal. Here however even that appeal seems gone for nothing can disguise her sleepwalking performance in a dual role as twins one of whom is murdered her death scene is brutal the other of whom decides to investigate the death never believing it was the suicide it was assumed to be. Soon after her investigation begins she meets the man who unbeknownst to her murdered her sister. This man is played by Matt Dillon who is supposed to be charming seductive secretive elusive and ruthless. While one can easily imagine an actor as physically pretty as Robert Wagner  he wasn't just 'handsome' he was 'pretty' let's face it  Matt Dillon is simply wrong in every manner for this part. Totally miscast he is neither particularly charming nor seductive and seemingly unable to register the ruthlessness and danger the part calls for. His thick New York accent is also a distraction at least in this role. That he and Young have absolutely no chemistry doesn't help matters any making yet another major quibble a minor one both seem a bit too old. In supporting roles as Dillon's mother and Young's father Diane Ladd and Max Von Sydow provide muchneeded class to the potboilerneonoir proceedings though Ladd comes off more successfully Von Sydow is utterly wasted. ANY actor could have done his role  why choose someone SO spectacularly talented for such a thankless part? As for the screenplay though based on the book it seems to be stuffed with every clich from every modernday thriller right down to the routine and predictable climax apparently reshot after test audiences didn't approve and the pointless if limited sex scenes which might titillate some thanks to mild nudity but do nothing to further the plot or add to the tension. The direction too is at fault since everything here is something you've seen before and in much better films and nearly each moment is telegraphed well in advance there are practically zero chills or thrills to be had. Strong actors may have been able to smooth over these problems but again the film is done no service by its leads particularly Young who is plain AWFUL. It surely stands with Demi Moore in The Scarlet Letter and Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls as being one of THE worst performances in a major motion picture  and perhaps even WORSE because Young is playing TWO parts. She rightfully won her 2 Razzies for Worst Actress and Supporting Actress. But as said Dillon's not too much better. A little bit but not much. HIS line readings at least don't suggest a coma. Unfortunately for the audience a coma might just be preferable to sitting through this lot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ira Levin's 1953 novel of the same name provides the inspiration for this offbeat thriller which features an homme fatale who marries for money is driven by an unusual obsession and kills without compunction. He's dangerous duplicitous and driven by a lust for wealth power and status that's so strong that it makes him deal ruthlessly with any impediments that get in his way. Because he's handsome an inveterate schemer and also appears to be very personable the danger he poses isn't readily apparent to other people and it's this quality that's well exploited to provide A Kiss Before Dying with most of its suspense.Since his early childhood Jonathan Corliss Matt Dillon had been obsessed by the wealth and power of the Carlsson family who owned the local copper mining company and this triggered in him a determination to achieve the same level of success and prestige in his own life. As a student at the University of Pennsylvania he takes his first steps to achieving his goal by dating Dorothy Carlsson Sean Young the blonde daughter of the company's owner. Their relationship is kept a secret from their fellow students and goes well until Dorothy tells Jonathan that she's pregnant and feels compelled to get married without delay even though this would inevitably mean being disinherited by her very conservative father. Jonathan seems to play along with the idea of getting married when the couple go to Philadelphia City Hall but arranges to arrive when the marriage licence bureau is closed and then suggests that they pass their waiting time up on the roof of the building. It's there that he takes the opportunity to throw Dorothy off a ledge to her certain death and casually leaves the building unnoticed as a crowd gather's around his victim's bloodcovered body.Dorothy's death is treated as a suicide by the authorities but her twin sister Ellen also played by Sean Young doesn't believe this verdict for a minute. She knows it would have been totally out of character for her sister to do such a thing and her view is reinforced by the discovery that on the day of her death Dorothy had bought a new pair of shoes.Jonathan hitchhikes to New York and his conversation with his driver fortuitously provides him with all the material he needs to assume a new identity when he becomes a social worker and colleague of Ellen Carlsson who he befriends and later marries. As Jay Faraday Jonathan gradually seems to achieve what he wanted after cleverly gaining the confidence of Ellen's father Thor Carlsson Max von Sydow and being appointed to a highpowered job in his company. Ellen's continued determination to discover the truth about her twin's death however continues to cause problems which he naturally confronts very directly.What makes Jonathan Corliss' obsession so unusual is the way in which he seems to regard the Carlssons as being synonymous with everything he craves rather than just being an example of it and it's this that makes him such a danger to that family. His obsession stems from his modest background and his childhood during which he used to stare at the freight trains passing by his home and noticed the words Carlsson Copper Corp which were prominently displayed on the sides of each truck.The brooding quality that Matt Dillon shows at various junctures effectively signals the presence of his obsession and the subtle ways in which he balances his character's psychopathic and more conventional behaviours also makes his performance both strong and effective. There are also good supporting performances from Max von Sydow and Diane Ladd as Jonathan's mother but Sean Young's portrayal of Ellen is quite expressionless at times and for this reason fails to be convincing.The plot of the 1956 forerunner of this movie which starred Robert Wagner and Joanne Woodward has been tweaked to make it better attuned to its 1980s setting and is also wellserved by having been injected with plenty of pace and tension. The story itself is also sufficiently different from most similar thrillers to easily sustain its audience's high level of interest from start to finish.".

Jonathan then talks the madly in love with him Dorothy into going up on the roof to see the sights until the office opens. Chitchatting with Dorothy about their forthcoming marriage and what her authoritative father copper tycoon Thor Carlsson Max Von Sydowwould do to her when he found about about it. Jonathan suddenly grabs a shocked Dorothy by her legs and shoves her off the roof and to her death below. Quickly leaving the building Jonathan drops a letter in the mailbox written by Dorothy that's supposed to be a suicide note that he had earlier tricked her into writing.We later learn that Dorothy was made pregnant by Jonathan and the thought of him marrying her with her father cutting Dorothy out of her sizable inheritance was not in his plans. This drove him to murder her in order to keep Mr. Carlsson from finding out about it which he did anyway. What we also learn in what's in Jonathan's sick and devious plans is to go to step two and get to know and romance Dortohy's twin sister Ellen also played by Sean Young. In this way Jonathan can have her replace the deceased Dorothy as his very rich and future wife.Hitchhiking to New York City where Ellen works as a volunteer at Castel House a Covenant Houselike shelter for the homeless Jonathan is picked up Jay FaradayAdam Horovitz who we later find out he murdered and stole his identity. In no time at all Jonathan works his way into Ellen's heart getting a job at Castle House and working together with her driving around the drug and crime infested streets of midtown Manhattan. The two volunteer workers pick up and give hope as well as finding a home for discarded homeless and drugaddicted youths. Unknown to Jonathan Ellen never believed that her sister Dorothy killed herself and with her going out on her own to solve Dorothy's death it will lead to uncovering who her real killer is Ellen's future husband Jonathan now known as Jay Faraday Corliss!Unlike in the original A Kiss Before Dying in the updated version Jonathan and Ellen do get married and her finding out about him being her sister's murderer she discovers on her own. Not with the help of the excop and now private investigator Dan Corelli James Russo whom she hired. Ellen as well as her father Thor are far more naive about her boyfriendhusband in this version of the movie then in he original with all the clues about Jonathan right in front of them. The most obvious being that Jonathan was using an assumed and stolen from one of his murder victims name which by not being able to find that very simple fact out was by far the biggest blunder that Thor Cralsson made in the movie. Were earlier told that Mr. Carlsson was so protective of his daughters that he had anyone who dated them investigated from head to toe. So why couldn't he find out that his future soninlaw was not only an impostor but possibly with him assuming the name of a missing person a murderer as well!The ending is by far the best part of the movie far better then the ending of the 1956 version. Even though overall it was not as good as the 1956 original Jonathan gets it a lot worse here in the form of a runaway diesel locomotive where in the 1956 film he was only done in by an 18 wheeler.".

	schema:headline " Decent plot marred by awful acting";
	schema:reviewBody "For this type of thriller this movie is entirely average. The plot and overall theme is decent enough but the film loses any potential it might have by featuring such lousy acting. Even Max von Sydow who is a veteran and is normally an excellent actor was disappointing in this. The only actor who did even a decent job was Matt Dillon. The film also has a bad pace it's far too slow in fact it's incredibly slow and boring for such a short film it's just over 90 minutes yet I can't bring myself to sit through the entire thing againI did once but ever since then I haven't been able to do so. The climax in the film is also below average and flatout boring. The supposed twistintheend was lame and not to mention far too easy to figure out. Also the film introduces the villain far too early in my opinion. Five minutes into the film you knew who you were gonna root against. That's just too early. The film lacks any real surprises as well as any great qualities. The few scenes detailing the psychopath's gruesome murders are decent but lacks any real intensity or excitement simply because you know exactly what will happen. As far as thrillers go this is average and entirely forgettable. I recommend it only to the biggest of thriller fans. 510".

From the negative reaction at the initial test screenings to Golden Raspberry awards and tales of rewrites and reshoots et al this noir reboot is messy.The tiein to Hitchcock's Vertigo is glaringly not homage worthy and not just content with that director Dearden tries to use some of Hitchcock's macabre black humour to unintentionally not witty results. So with Young on hilariously bad form as well the thriller aspects strain to get resuscitated for dramatic worth.Dearden does show some nice touches with his camerawork and there's a lurid quality to Southon's colour lenses that pay respect in heart to Levin's source material but ultimately it's hard to recommend seriously to noir fans and the 56 version itself not without problems is still the way to go. 510".

The biggest problem with this film is there are way too many coincidences. Also some parts are downright unbelievable. Here are some of the holes The first murder it's hard to believe that if you murder someone on the rooftop of a highrise building that someone from a nearby building wouldn't have seen anything and reported it to the police. Why wouldn't the cops check for prints on the victim's shoes or purse? Why wouldn't they take a DNA sample from the fetus in order to determine the father of the unborn child? The second murder what did Jonathan do with Jay's body? Why wouldn't the cops check for prints on Jay's car? Why wouldn't millionaire Carlsson have investigated the background of Jay Farraday and discovered discrepancies with Jonathan's alterego? The third murder how could the killer work in New York but find the exact moment to follow his girlfriend to Philadephia? How was he able to see what kind of car the murder victim was driving and then go back to his own car so that he could follow him to his apartment? The fourth murder the detective traced the victim's call to the killer's phone and could have seen how many minutes they spoke yet did not ask for the killer's alibi. Dorothy just happened to be listening when her old acquaintance's murder was announced on the radio. Wouldn't the killer have been smart enough to weigh down the suitcase with the sliced up body and wrap it up so that it wouldn't come open in the ocean? He had an incinerator in his building. Why wouldn't he use it? The worst coincidences the killer could murder a sister then go to her identical twin and have her fall in love with him and marry him. What are the odds in a city of 7 million people and thousands of restaurants of JonathanJay running into a former coworker from another city at the same time that he had Dorothy with him a rarity in itself?".

He just seems to be in the right place at the right time just once or twice too often for my tastes.I fell in love with Sean Young when she did No Way Out back in 1987. I haven't seen much of her lately and understand that she has not been doing so well. I thought she was good in this role and think that she has been unfairly criticized.Still I believe film noir is best watched in films of the fifties and remakes just don't do it for me.".

This German Count prefers elegant sports like fencing or drinking more exciting if both are being played at the same time.Strange and modern times are these even in Germany when ordinary people don't appreciate the merits of their ancestors forgetting and confusing titles of nobility as happens in this film in where a football player is considered a king! for the longhaired hordes what a disgrace are those the newest heroes?... it seems so because the film stars Herr Paul Richter onetime Siegfried and now a footballer With the same running time as a football match the film is as boring as that ordinary sport  the story is full of clichs that mix sports and romance depicting the story of Tull Harper football player but also son of a leather manufacturer who is heading for bankruptcy in his business. This serious problem could be avoided with the help of Mabel Douglas  Aud Egede Nissen  a rich and Amerikan backer who doesn't really know if that nice boy loves her only for their millions  football and millions??... what an incongruity .One of the scarce merits of this film is that is considered as one of the first football films in Deutschland not a film genre in itself. It is an unimportant film that doesn't work as a football documentary  the film includes only simple football shots  and even less as a romance film with its static and foreseeable story full of the usual things he loves me she loves me not  a tale that will end in a boring but supposedly interesting football match in where our modern hero obviously will win the match and the girl's love and fortune.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must dribble one of his Teutonic heiresses.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com".
