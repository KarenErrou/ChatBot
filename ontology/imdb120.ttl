It's unusual for a feature like this to even show at the TIFF which should say something about it.  I know it sounds like a hard sell.  The whole thing takes place outside a phone booth in Manhattan and it was shot in 10 days for less than 2 million dollars.  But this movie is electric.  It BLEW ME AWAY!  Stuart Stu' Shepard Colin Farrell a sleazy publicist uses this phone booth to call his girlfriend because his wife checks his cell phone bills.  The phone rings and when he picks it up all hell breaks loose.  The voice on the other end Kiefer Sutherland is just terrifying warns him that if he leaves the booth he will be killed.  At first Stu doesn't believe him but we find out pretty quick that his life is in real danger and the stranger on the other end of the line knows EVERYTHING about Stu and his life.  Then the police show up Forest Whitaker is wonderful as always as the cop in charge and order Stu out of the booth.  I spent the next hour on the edge of my seat.  I don't want to give anything more away but it is one of the most suspenseful movies I've seen in a very long time!  You should go see this movie!  I don't think it's going to get a very big release even though it's directed by Joel Schumacher St. Elmo's Fire Flatliners Batman and Robin 8mm Tigerland.  Schumacher was at the screening and he talked about how a number of different actors including  Mel Gibson and directors had been attached to the script and it had taken years to get it to the screen.  He was able to do it with Colin Farrell after 20th Century Fox exec's saw him in Tigerland' and decided to take a chance.  But he's still not considered a big' star.  And Kiefer only came to the project at the end though Schumacher said he was the only guy for the role and I agree and you don't see him much.  So the movie may not get much of a push when it comes out.  Don't let that dissuade you.  If you like a good ride you should go see this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stu Shepherd is in public relations and uses lies and deceit everyday in his job to get things moving.  When calling a client from a phone booth in the hope of getting her to a hotel.  When he hangs up the phone rings and he answers to what he assumes is a prank call.  However the caller reveals more and more about Stu exposing his lies.  When Stu tries to leave the caller reveals that he has Stu pinned down with a sniper rifle and the death of a man by the booth proves it.  The police arrive and surround Stu while the caller continues his game.Everyone knows that it had a small budget a shooting window of just over a week and that it was made years ago and shelved as Farrell's star power increased and real life terrorist attacks and snipers came and went in the media and the mind of the American public.  So I'll not dwell on that and instead talk of the film!  The pitch was enough to get me interested  man is held in phone box by sniper'  sounds great!  I really wanted to see this film but was put off by the trailer but not of the films I saw wrong in the trailer were to the detriment of the film as over 80odd minutes it really runs like a race horse.Starting with humour and a freeflowing pace it turns sinister early on but keeps the pace.  In terms of plot it has many good twists and turns that will keep you interested and on the edge of your seat.  The only issue for me was accepting why the sniper was doing it and how he was able to get access to the equipment he would have needed as well as the information  not to mention the WILL to do it!  Also little things bugged me but the film carries itself over these obstacles well enough and reservations are soon forgotten.  It sounds simple but the simple ideas work best and although low on action sorry teen boys! it is driven by dialogue and simply not knowing what will come next.The direction helps the film by constantly moving and using split screens etc to give the impression that a lot is going on at once  again making the film feel like it has a fast pace.  It feels a little gimmicky especially now that we've had 2 series of 24 doing the same thing but it works regardless.  I wrote in an old review 8mm I think that I would never pay to see a Joel Schumacher film ever again and I DIDN'T pay to see Phone Booth!  However I was surprised because he didn't ruin it!  He did a good job  yes  you heard me!  His usual excesses seem to have been controlled by a good producer and editing team and the film works  much to my surprise and relief!Farrell may not be a bonafide Hollywood star yet but he takes the task of being onscreen for almost the whole film and runs with it.  He makes a comically cruel character someone that reveals himself to be a loser but never loses the audience  and that takes talent.  Sutherland's voice on the trailer didn't work for me too normal and slow but in the film he is excellent like the director said noone else could have done the role he is right for it.  Whitaker makes up the third lead and he holds his corner well.It may not be without the odd flaw but this film manages to be simple gripping and very effective.  Well worth a look.".

	onyx:emotionText "Stu Shepherd is in public relations and uses lies and deceit everyday in his job to get things moving.  When calling a client from a phone booth in the hope of getting her to a hotel.  When he hangs up the phone rings and he answers to what he assumes is a prank call.  However the caller reveals more and more about Stu exposing his lies.  When Stu tries to leave the caller reveals that he has Stu pinned down with a sniper rifle and the death of a man by the booth proves it.  The police arrive and surround Stu while the caller continues his game.Everyone knows that it had a small budget a shooting window of just over a week and that it was made years ago and shelved as Farrell's star power increased and real life terrorist attacks and snipers came and went in the media and the mind of the American public.  So I'll not dwell on that and instead talk of the film!  The pitch was enough to get me interested  man is held in phone box by sniper'  sounds great!

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever seen a movie that you would actually pay money to watch more than once?  What if I told you that this film had a setting of only one main location two main actors and three supporting cast members?  While these elements don't make up what a classic movie sounds like on paper add director Joel Schumacher Bad Company 8mm into the mix along with screenwriter Larry Cohen who had this story handed down to him by Alfred Hitchcock himself about 30 years ago and you have the perfect blend of blackmail violence and extortion  Phone Booth. The story begins by showing a glimpse into the life of Stu Shepard Daredevil's Colin Farrell.  Stu is a New York hustler that people love to hate.  He is egotistical twofaced to everyone he knows and does what he can for personal gratification.  He even fantasizes about cheating on his wife Kelly Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell and the object of that desire is Pamela McFadden Dawson Creek's Katie Holmes.  Pam is a young actress trying to get her first break while Stu has been grooming her for the big time.  To avoid having his calls to Pam appear on his cellular phone bill Stu calls her from the lone phone booth left in the heart of NYC. However things would be different on this day.  Upon hanging up he receives a call that would turn his whole world upside down. The caller 24's Kiefer Sutherland is a sniper who has been targeting highprofile underhanded suits just like Stu.  He has a few simple rules so that Stu does not meet the same fate that two others had before him don't leave the booth don't tell anyone who he's talking to and most importantly don't hang up.  To prove his seriousness the caller shoots and kills a pimp who tries to physically remove Stu from the booth for taking too much time with his call.  This as expected does not help matters and the fallen pimp's hookers now believe it was indeed Stu who committed the murder.  Soon the NYPD and numerous media outlets are covering this serious situation. Things become increasingly difficult for Stu Shepard as Kelly and Pam both show up.  In the meantime the caller continues to play various mind games while the sympathetic NYPD Captain Ramey Twilight Zone's Forest Whitaker tries to solve the issue.  During all of this Stu tries to maintain his sanity and not risk any more lives.  His lies no longer matter.  As a result he must now search his soul discover himself and attempt to outsmart the caller taking the game to a whole new level. The cinematography is outstanding. Schumacher uses the right angle for every shot and manages to keep everyone's attention with quick pans and abrupt cuts.  In the end the 80minute movie seems longer but not because it is boring.  The biggest payoff comes with the twist ending that changes the film's outcome within sixty seconds. There was not one bad performance in Phone Booth.  Farrell's ability to convert his Irish brogue to a Brooklyn drawl makes his performance as Bullseye in Daredevil look like a child's school play when compared to the Broadwaylevel of acting he manages here.  While Mitchell and Holmes did not have lengthy parts their roles added just enough to the story and they managed to perform up to the standards of their characters.  Forest Whitaker was a surprisingly great addition to the cast and his role as a sympathetic cop is one that's not often seen and should thus be welcomed.  However all of these actors are outshined by Kiefer Sutherland who ends up being extremely creepy and one of the best antagonists in recent movie history by just using his voice. Will this win Best Picture at next year's Academy Awards? It probably won't.  However with a great story topnotch directing and a cast with great chemistry what more could you ask for?  Out of a possible five stars I give this the limit of five with desires to go even higher.  While I would go see it again and again not everyone has the same tastes.  However I would put down the 8 for a ticket to see the flick at least once.  If nothing else it will make you stop and think  the next time you enter a phone booth just who will be watching?".

It's amazing that how they managed to make an 80 minute movie with just a guy in a phone booth but the full credit goes to Colin Farrell and Larry Cohen the writer not Joel Schumacher because he is a crappy director. Joel Schumacher's films are rubbish especially The Number 23 Phone Booth was shot in 10 days with a budget of 10 million so it wasn't a hard job to make it that's why Joel doesn't get any credit but the cast  crew did a fantastic job. I also really liked the raspberry coloured shirt Colin was wearing and it was an excellent choice of clothing because the viewers are going to watch him throughout the whole film. When I first saw the movie I fell in love with it and I bought it on DVD the next day and I've seen it about 20 times and I'm still not fed up with it. Phone Booth is and always will be Colin Farrell's best film! Overall it is simply one of my favourite films and I even argued over my friend because he didn't like it.".

He knew everything about Farrell's life he was an expert marksman he was an electronics bugging expert he was a phone system expert so his calls are untraceable he was an expert at predicting police tactics etc etc etc... and then lets himself be found just at the right time in the plot by previously phoning a traceable call from the apartment which is to be the scene of his crimes.The ending was a cop out I saw the pizza guy denouement a mile off without seeing any reviews or hints who kills themselves by hacking through their own throats when police are running up the stairs outside the door and you have a gun available?

Forest Whitaker was very good.Kiefer Sutherland was excellent!The performances from Radha MitchellKatie Holmesand Paula Jai Parker were good.I like how the film had the Hulk like split screens.I also like that fact that it focused on the victim and the killer almost the entire hour and twentyone minutes!The end is just unbelievable! Joel Schumacher is a very good director in My opinion and this movie deserves a lot of attention in My opinion.If you want a short film that keeps you going until the end and an ending that is very surprising then check out the Phone Booth!";

Speed Saw and Phone Booth all present situations where you cant help but become intrigued to how it'll pan out or be solved.Phone Booth as you may have guessed is set within a phone booth. Coline Farrel enters the booth a cockyconfident man and leaves it with a very different attitude. So how can a film which is primarly set in a phone booth keep you hooked for 80 minutes. Well early in the film a man is shot in public and witnesses and evidence suggest its farrel thats the culprit. Farrel cant do anything about it because he'l be shot by a sniper viewing the booth if he hangs up or leaves. So now you've got the police on hand as a second outfit and another dilemma for farrel to face. They are trying to bring him out of the booth but if he does come out hes to be shot. You can see how the writers expanded a simple situation ad blown it waaaay out of proportion. Its great. The films offers sharp dialogue and fine acting only from farrel but hes all that matters really. Farrel displays all emotions humanly possible throughout the film. Mostly fear. By Hollywood standards this film is relatively short running time but this works for it as perhaps 2hours would have been to long to keep the dialogue from becoming tedious. To some up this is a top film. Watch it. It wont take long.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contains Spoiler A tense taut darkly funny 81minute package of Hitchcockian suspense set in New York City although the scenes specifically involving the phone booth were filmed in Los Angeles the art direction and veteran thriller genius Larry Cohen's biting script gave those scenes a very convincing Times Square ambience. It really reminded me of the seedy Times Square of my youth!  PHONE BOOTH is a film that everyone in front of and behind the camera should be proud of.  In particular it's a tour de force for Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland.  Farrell doing a good Bronx accent that also sounds slightly Latinotinged to my native New Yorker ears shows why he was long touted as The Next Big Thing even before he finally got some hit movies under his belt. As slippery publicist Stu Shepard the intense kinetic Farrell runs the gamut of emotions he's like Nicolas Cage in dramatic mode without the scenerychewing!  Sutherland has never been more sinister in a mostly voiceover role as Farrell's nemesisselfappointed conscience. Ron Eldard reportedly did the voice of The Caller first but maybe after seeing the rushes PB director Joel Schumacher decided the part needed more star power andor menace so he recruited his old bud' and colleague Sutherland. It was a good move and I'm not just saying that because Sutherland is one of my longtime faves. When Sutherland plays bad guys he gets this great silky menace to his voice kinda like James Mason without the British accent  and it's very effective in PB.  Sutherland is seen very briefly in the film too so I must assume they filmed that footage later but it certainly blends in seamlessly with the rest of the movie. SPOILER ALERT... I actually found it darkly funny even Kafkaesque that The Caller's reasons for terrorizing arrogant married PR flack Stu included his aspiring to lure actressclient Pam the everappealing Katie Holmes into an affair. Think about it  The Caller was so twistedly selfrighteous and judgmental that he was punishing his victims or Stu anyway for thoughtcrimes!  How Big Brother can you get?!  ...END SPOILER ALERT.  While PB was well worth seeking out in actual theaters especially since it has lots of cool splitscreen shots and inset effects that are especially effective on a big screen its claustrophobic nature also makes it wellsuited to the small TV screen. Check out Schumacher's enjoyable DVD commentary too.".

But trust when I say that this movie was just great! The film stars Colin Farrell Forest Whitaker Katie Holmes and Radha Mitchell and is about a man who is held hostage in a phone booth by a sniper. Without spoiling anything I will say that this is definitely a comeback for Joel Schumacher after making Batman  Robin. It is a welldirected wellacted fast paced solid flick which I wasn't bored with for a second. I thought that Colin Farrell was great as the lead actor in the movie and I'm sure that whoever is interested in solid thrillers will most likely like this flick. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the genre! 1010".

The real movie starts at the time when Colin Farrel is held hostage at the phone booth by the unknown hidden kiefer Sutherland but before he also puts the curtain away from the secret life of Farrel on the other line by calling his girl friend and Farrel was listening but wasn't able to do any thing then he demonstrate to Farrel that he has got an eye on him  a telescopic view through a 50 caliber rifle and if he tries to walk away he ll be shot at point blank range. and now the chase begins when Stu Shepard is forced to tell the truths about his life which he hided form his wife  girlfriend his secretary and colleagues. Forrest Whitaker plays here the police detective who arrives at the scene when a crime is committed and Farrel is considered as prime suspect but he is amazed by the ongoing situation  he really wants to know who s on the line with Farrel  what conversation they are having how can he make Farrel out of the booth and surrender. In this scenario of the movie the shooter in fact is a person who hates lier's  deceptive and hypocrites  his main purpose is to punish them by his own and expose their mysterious double standard lives with fraud attitude. When you see this film you ll watch lots o twists in the story. A very nicely executed movie".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing what he'd done with the Batman franchise and Nicolas Cage in 8MM you wouldn't believe that Joel Schumacher could make a good movie would you? Phone Booth starring Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland is a surprisingly astounding film and a nearperfect example of psychological thriller. And I insist on both words because none of them is separable from the other.Farrell is Stu a NY press agent who oversees everybody and has a wife Radha Mitchell as well as a mistress Katie Holmes. He seems to appreciate his lifestyle but everything is about to change into an unforgettable way.After Stu called up his mistress in a phone booth the phone rings. Stu answers only to find himself eartoear with a sniper voiced by Sutherland.It's now that the twisted mind game begins. The sniper is a typical one ie. that he knows everything about everybody including Stu. He claims to be some kind of angellike figure who wants to force sinners to expiate their faults to the society. And this time he aims Stu.Rarely have I seen a thriller so exciting so mindtorturing. These sensations are mainly due to Farrell and Sutherland.Farrell offers an extraordinary performance as Stu. We can feel his fear his anger his desperation during the short 80 minutes of the movie. His transformation is real and sincere. We really can feel it.Sutherland's role is as great but for different reasons. His task is gigantic to sound menacing bright skillful and sarcastic only with his voice. And he fits perfectly. The result is that the Sutherlandvoiced sniper becomes as terrifying and frightening as other mind players such as Hannibal Lecter.Merit should also be given to screenwriter Larry Cohen. The Phone Booth script is easily his best after Carrie which he wrote almost 25 years earlier. The story is simple but very intelligent very developed.The conclusion is stupendous. At first I believed that I was watching another one of these thriller conclusions that are halfcooked because they can't render justice to the main part. But then the plot twists and we just can't believe that we've been fooled like that.I also liked the cinematography. Mainly the screen divided in multiple parts so the viewer can follow many scenes at once. It's nicely depicted by director Schumacher.I deserve great regards for Phone Booth especially for Farrell and Sutherland. It's one of the greatest thrillers of the still young 21st century and it acts as some kind of redemption for critic scapegoat Joel Schumacher.By the way would you dare to go into a phone booth after you see this movie?".

Everything from the thick New York accent to the devolution of his character seemed very natural and perfectly delivered. Kiefer Sutherland providing the voice of the sniper delivers a daunting performance. With merely his voice he displays an intelligent darkly comical and foreboding presence that makes the movie work. Forest Whitaker also gives a standout performance in his supporting role as captain of the task force.Joel Schumacher uses smart camera techniques whether it being the use of split screens or fast cuts to cultivate an atmosphere of sheer intensity and anticipation. It can be difficult to string along a story which takes place in mostly one setting but the pace seems to never let up from start to finish. The director editors and anyone else involved in the visual cutting of this film deserve a lot of praise. Phone Booth is creative entertaining and ultra suspenseful. Pick up this call.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two names who aren't exactly my favourite names in the movie world Colin Farrell and Joel Schumacher. The first because I often find him annoying pretentious arrogant and so on. The second because I can never forgive him for Batman  Robin. So its fair to say I had my trepidations for this film in which Farrell is the lead and Schumacher is the director. Thankfully I was wrong to have doubts. Phone Booth is a magnificent return to form for Schumacher  a suspenseful surprising minilabyrinth of a film with perhaps even slight elements of Hitchcockian film making. The film is set mainly in the title phone booth and the street it is on and once Farrell's character of Stu Shepherd gets to the aforementioned telephone we never really leave it again. For this to work properly there have to be two factors that help us to ignore the claustrophobic settings dialogue and acting. The plot is well written simple yet effective. All in all its mainly a twohander between Farrell and his anonymous captive. The latter is played with menacing vigour by Keifer Sutherland who is never really seen throughout the majority of the film and so has to pull of a a very convincing voice over gig. It is also a tour de force for Farrell who takes his character from arrogant pretentious selfcentred hmmm... to sympathetic redemptive decent. It's just a shame that there is not much of a role for the always excellent Forest Whitaker though I'm kind of grateful that Katie Holmes has even less time.Another complaint I would have is the length of the film. Okay so its short snappy and to the point but you do feel a little shortchanged towards the end. It's as if the plot ran out of money before you could finish the call. Still for tense enjoyable entertainment you could do much worse than this.710".

Everyone is gushing about how incredibly well they did by shooting the movie in 10 days don't independent film makers do this regularly? and we get to see just how incredible Farrell's performance is before they spoiled it in the edit and made certain lines seem extremely hammy.The take they show of Farrell confessing all for example is much more powerful without all the cheesy close ups. That scene seems so amazing when you see it raw in the 'making of' that I wonder why they didn't keep it that way. Farrell deservedly gets an ovation after his lengthy deliveryThis movie reminds me a little of 'Dog Day Afternoon' only the way that movie was shot and put together seemed a lot more authentic.

It is a thoroughly original idea  a publicist who has been lying his way to success is held inside the phone booth he has been using to cheat on his wife by an unseen sniper on the other end of the line who wants him to confess to his wife. It is very well acted with Colin Farrell portraying the desperation of his character really well while Kiefer Sutherland while only seen for a few seconds plays The Caller very well. His character is a very good and original one as while he does kill innocent people without remorse his real victims are chosen well. He uses threat to try and force them to come clean and stop cheating in life. It is one of the few films where you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. His voice on the phone is also chillingly brilliant. Without that voice the film wouldn't be nearly as effective in achieving the suspense generated. Forrest Whitaker also puts in a nice performance as the detective trying to resolve the situation.The camerawork is also fantastic. The shots rotating 360 degrees looking up at the tall buildings give you a feeling of claustrophobia like you are also stuck in the phone booth with Stu. Interesting dialogue a thrilling situation a couple of nice twists and a completely fresh idea make this a top film and is one of Joel Schumacher's best achievements.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is another example of why perspicacious cinemagoers have always needed to be very wary when major studios decide to remake a well known classic. Perhaps IMDb should create a list of such remakes and give viewers the chance to vote on them as better or worse than the original possibly adding comments when appropriate. Hopefully these comments might make the studios concerned much more wary about following this rather dubious practice. This 1983 film is a remake in colour of the classic black and white film of the same name starring Margaret Lockwood which was released in 1945 and it can still be readily found on videotape. Unfortunately the original 1945 film is not and is becoming very hard to find outside the U.K. where Margaret Lockwood's name still commands enormous respect in the entertainment world.Although this remake was able to obtain an R rating in the U.S.A. by report only with considerable difficulty it is in my opinion straight pornography not because it realistically portrays the cruelty and violence of an eighteenth century execution at Tyburn shows two women fighting with horsewhips and includes a little more nudity than was generally regarded as acceptable at the time of its release but because all these scenes were only peripherally necessary to the story line and were clearly only featured and prolonged in the way that they were for the purpose of audience titillation. If you want to be titillated in this way then by all means watch this remake which will probably provide exactly what you expect but if you want to view a work of art which is in fact infinitely more sexy than this remake join the demand for a DVD of the 1945 film which is already available in PAL format for the European market to be released for the North American market as well. This 1945 film has never been released in its original form in the U.S.A. because the meticulously recreated seventeenth century costumes were too low cut to be acceptable to the American censors of the period so the original version had to be refilmed before it could find its way into North American cinemas. A North American DVD of this original release would therefore be a fitting tribute to a great work in this its diamond anniversary year.".

	schema:headline " Tasteless remake of Brit Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw the original black and white film on TV when I was a kid and have never forgotten it especially one scene in particular which I shall come to later.The later film follows the plot of the first film closely. The dialogue is often wordforword. The main difference actionwise is that several doses of nudity have been added to the 1983 version including an embarrassingly tacky catfight with whips. In IMDb's trivia section for this movie it is stated twice that the whip scene was already in the 1945 version but it certainly was NOT in the one that I saw.The original film is wonderfully cast the mildmannered but sympathetically dignified Sir Ralph Griffith Jones the gentlemanrogue highwayman James Mason the irritatingly pious butler Hogarth Felix Aylmer the dashing Kit Locksby Michael Rennie and sweet Caroline Patricia Roc.Interestingly Patricia Roc the supporting actress is actually more beautiful than Barbara Lockwood but Lockwood in the role of the scheming and dangerloving wicked Lady carries the film with ease and one feels that nobody could have played the role so perfectly! All this however is far from the case with the remake. Sir Ralph is played by a far far too old and unattractive Denholm Elliot.Kit Locksby is played by a totally undashing and wooden Oliver Tobias.Glynis Barber is OK as Caroline and Geilgud is pretty much the same as Aylmer in the butler role.It is clear that the producers have been very careful to make the supporting actresses much less attractive than 'star' Dunaway! This can be seen not only in the Carolines but in Ralph's sister Henrietta who in the first film is attractive and arch Enid StampTaylor but plain and peevish in the second Prunella Scales.Alan Bates manages the highwayman role OK until the speechbeforethehanging scene. Here you can't help but compare him to Mason and I'm afraid he falls very far short.But all this would be sort of acceptable if the lead could carry the most important role the wicked Lady herself. But Faye Dunaway is just not in the same league as Lockwood. And because so many scenes are exactly the same as the original you can't help but compare them.Add to this the fact that Winner has added several instances of gratuitous nudity along with a tacky sexbyanopenfire scene between Tobias and Barber. To avoid confusion let me emphasise that the following concerns the original Wicked Lady film and NOT the remake! This film succeeds because it precisely balances all our conflicting sympathies. Yes we DO feel sorry for Caroline that Barbara comes and steals the love of her life Sir Ralph but we also understand that Barbara soon gets bored with his staidness. She may be wicked but she's FUN and we enjoy to see her impose her own terms upon the household opening the locked room with the secret passage and moving in there to have both her independence and an escape route to freedom and excitement.When she begins her wild affair with the highwayman she cuckolds Ralph and yet we don't feel very sorry for him because we know that he was not only foolish to have married her in the first place but in doing so he spurned and humiliated the gentle Caroline.Eventually Barbara's lawlessness leads to harm her killing of the coachman Ned for which she seems to feel genuine remorse and then the poisoning of the butler. When Hogarth discovers Barbara's wicked ways she realises all will be lost if he talks. Quickly understanding the only way to get round him Barbara appeals to his spiritual pride begging him to help her 'reform'.And so begins a regime of 'goodness' and 'good works'. This is rather comical and we sympathise with her trials and strangely continue to sympathise with her even when she uses poison to get rid of her tormentor. But when the dying butler threatens to talk Barbara must deal with the situation quickly and deal with it she does.In the movie's for me most unforgettable scene Barbara presses the pillow on Hogarth's face to finish him off. I don't know quite why the director felt obliged to make an insertion at this point but we are given a sudden extreme closeup of her eyes looking shifty perhaps intended to remind us of her wickedness or possible simply to remind us that Ralph and the others are just beyond the curtain. Whatever but after this insert we are given a shot so beautifully framed and lighted that Lady Barbara looks almost angelic. And as she finishes the deed she gives a little sigh of accomplishment that is almost orgasmic! The film manipulates our sympathies so deftly that we don't really grasp how immoral it all really is.Caroline is united in the end with her Ralph and we think this is only right and good. After all Ralph is the one who in a key scene stands up to all the other landowners and judges and even berates them for their treatment of the poor showing that though mild at home he CAN be tough when it comes to fighting for justice.Note how in this scene in the later movie Ralph's speech is severely curtailed making him seem far more weak and ineffectual.The remake in fact handles everything very coarsely. Winner and Dunaway make Barbara so grotesque that we can neither identify with her nor feel sympathy for her.So if you're planning to watch The Wicked Lady 1983 please don't bother but hunt down a copy of the original from 1945. You won't be disappointed!".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw the original black and white film on TV when I was a kid and have never forgotten it especially one scene in particular which I shall come to later.The later film follows the plot of the first film closely. The dialogue is often wordforword. The main difference actionwise is that several doses of nudity have been added to the 1983 version including an embarrassingly tacky catfight with whips. In IMDb's trivia section for this movie it is stated twice that the whip scene was already in the 1945 version but it certainly was NOT in the one that I saw.The original film is wonderfully cast the mildmannered but sympathetically dignified Sir Ralph Griffith Jones the gentlemanrogue highwayman James Mason the irritatingly pious butler Hogarth Felix Aylmer the dashing Kit Locksby Michael Rennie and sweet Caroline Patricia Roc.Interestingly Patricia Roc the supporting actress is actually more beautiful than Barbara Lockwood but Lockwood in the role of the scheming and dangerloving wicked Lady carries the film with ease and one feels that nobody could have played the role so perfectly! All this however is far from the case with the remake. Sir Ralph is played by a far far too old and unattractive Denholm Elliot.Kit Locksby is played by a totally undashing and wooden Oliver Tobias.Glynis Barber is OK as Caroline and Geilgud is pretty much the same as Aylmer in the butler role.It is clear that the producers have been very careful to make the supporting actresses much less attractive than 'star' Dunaway! This can be seen not only in the Carolines but in Ralph's sister Henrietta who in the first film is attractive and arch Enid StampTaylor but plain and peevish in the second Prunella Scales.Alan Bates manages the highwayman role OK until the speechbeforethehanging scene.

Faye Dunaway and Alan Bates act like they are in an uproarious bawdy romp but the rest of the cast play it straight. Faye Dunaway is particularly odd she continuously pulls the most bizarre comedy faces and bugs her eyes out in an effort to portray the scheming and greedy personality of the lead character Lady Barbara Skelton whose exploits form the main story of the film. There's definitely a juicy tale here with Lady Skelton robbing seducing lying and murdering her way through the cast to get what she wants but the presentation here really wastes the material. The events of the story are dashed through at great speed giving the viewer little chance to empathise with any of the characters but as most of the emotions are portrayed in such a throwaway manner I certainly never felt drawn in. Again Dunaway suggests no depth to the character she plays. But the presentation of the action is the real offender. There's no time for anything to sink in. As soon as the film starts Lady Skelton is stealing a man then next minute she's married then stealing then tricking all without pausing for breathThere are some things to enjoy including the beautiful English scenery and antique architecture plus some nice performances from Denham Elliott and Prunella Scales in supporting roles but the smaller parts such as bawdy waitresses and strumpets of which there are many are wretchedly hammy. There are many scenes of nudity all of which look completely incongruous for the period the film is set in and exist only for titillation. To sum up this is a very juvenile film with little depth and a huge waste of talent and money.".

The film realizes its hideousness from the opening shot of a rotting hanging dead man having his brains eaten by birds and the shot if a topless woman running out of a barn with Directed by Michael Winner covering the woman's breasts. Faye is in the country for the marriage of her good friend which she quickly breaks up marrying wealthy Denholm Elliott and kissing another man within his view at the reception. Within days she's a masked bandit robbing coaches for the heck of it and taking as many lovers as she can.It's obvious that the covered face of the bandits is a woman's and that the wealthy people she robs do not recognize them. Faye finds a rival bandit turned lover in the not so dashing Alan Bates a decent character actor but far from lothario material. John Gielgud struggles to keep his dignity among this trashy mess as the very religious old servant but it's obvious that he's very uncomfortable saying and listening to the hideous dialog of the script. This is just a tacky throwback to period disasters such as Joseph Andrews and Yellowbeard. Dunaway does get laughs but in all honesty they are a at her expense. In her early films she was soft as she played at being seductive but there's a scary masculinity towards her villainous villain making her scary to imagine in anything that requires the removal of clothes. Are we supposed to believe that Dunaway is angry at God for taking her mother too soon hence her determination to kill the religiously obsessed Gielgud who hopes to reform her upon discovering her secret? Shots of secondary characters bare breasts and butts is gratuitous and just crude. Faye overacts in the most absurd manner and the fact that the script refuses to see the truth about her even when it's as close as a pillow to their face makes this just the most asinine script ever written. This is the type of film that makes the audience want to have the Oscar taken back from and her performance makes Mommie Dearest seem subtle. Bad movie fans will have a ball with this. Faye has a ball with the whipping scene but the audience is the one who ends up scarred.".

Faye enjoys herself but she could have let rip a little more gone the extra inch to portray this very wicked lady. On the whole an amusing matine movie. I think if it had less nudity it could have been a film for the whole family as it was a lot of kids who could have enjoyed it were left out.

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock's style as a director was a bit like a train  it ran perfectly well but only along its own lines. He wasn't comfortable adapting his style to suit the material but when the material suited his style he could do incredible things.Three years and five pictures into his Hollywood career Hitch had been having some trouble finding projects he was comfortable with. He had made a couple of adventure thrillers in the vein of his late 30s British films but the old magic wasn't there. Finally with Shadow of a Doubt he came upon a project that was right up his street. It represents a welcome return to the domestic murder dramas that had given him his earliest successes The Lodger Blackmail with a storyline ideal for Hitchcock. It is the purest example of murder in a normal setting bringing the audience uncomfortably close to the killer helped along with plenty of the grisly gallows humour that the Master loved.Hitch's British pictures had great charm and character but they were often technically a little haphazard. By now though he knows exactly how to use the camera to manipulate the audience. He begins by carrying us into the story sweeping in over the city through scenery both pretty and ugly to home in on an average looking neighbourhood. From then on every shot move and edit is calculated to keep up the suspense and unfold the plot. Whereas those early films were swamped and sometimes spoiled by showy camera tricks Hitch now uses those techniques sparingly like playing a trump card. For example he has Joseph Cotton look directly into the camera for a brief moment as he snatches the newspaper back from Theresa Wright. Another trick is to have the camera dolly back as a character advances only at a faster speed than the actor is moving which gives a very dizzying effect.Special mention should also be made of Dimitri Tiomkin's score. Tiomkin was the best composer Hitch worked with before Bernard Hermann and one of the few who really understood how a Hitchcock film needs to be scored. His sparse string arrangements really capture that sense of spiralling terror without overpowering the scene and turning it into melodrama. He interpolates Franz Lehar's Merry Widow waltz at just the right level making it noticeable but never overstated throwing in just a bar or two at an opportune moment sometimes disguising it in a minor key.We also have a great cast lined up here. This is among Joseph Cotton's finest performances which is unusual because Hitch was not a brilliant director of actors. I believe the reason is that although his soft honest features meant he usually played cleancut good guys as well as making him the perfect choice for the friendly uncle noone would suspect he was actually at his best when playing villains. That air of affected friendliness which gives way to a deadpan monotone is ironically far more convincing than when he attempted to play genuine niceness. Theresa Wright also does a brilliant job of handling her character's transition from childlike innocence to knowing cynicism. The icing on the cake is a couple of spoton comic relief supporting parts from Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn.It's quite appropriate that in his cameo for Shadow of a Doubt Hitchcock is shown holding all the cards because here he really did have all the elements working in his favour. It marks the beginning of his golden age and lays down the blueprint for such classics as Rear Window Vertigo and Psycho. This is about as close to perfect as Hitchcock's pictures get.".

	schema:reviewBody "One thing that strikes many who come upon Shadow of a Doubt one of this filmmaker's triumphs is the knowledge that it was Hitchcock's favorite among his own films and many watch it with very high expectations getting shot down as well making it one of his more underrated efforts. True it doesn't go for the immense macabre that lay in Psycho The Birds and Frenzy but it is very effective in telling its stories and giving us character to either love or love to hate.The whole concept to the story is very appealing a painfully normal suburban family gets a calling from a relative Uncle Charlie Joseph Cotten who wants to come by for a little while. The oldest daughter also named Charlie Teresa Wright almost feels like a kindred spirit to her uncle happy as can be that he's come to visit. Things start to unravel however when two detectives on his trail come into town bringing to young Charlie to light what could be going down or what might not be or what is as clear as psychopathic day.It's actually of interest to compare this film to Psycho I think in how it's so akin to to how Hitchcock tells the story of the ordinary people of the world getting involved with a certifiable gentlemen. And perhaps one could argue I might up to a point that Cotten's performance rivals that of a Perkins' Norman Bates leading male in the sense of subtleties of the suspense in the film. He seems so... calm so much in the film and even when he shows his hand as to who he really is there's a lot of depth to his personality. We may hate him but he is an understandable frighteningly recognizable monster. And it solidifies in my book that Cotten had a wonderful range in his work when he could go from playing a Jed Leland in Citizen Kane to this film and then on to The Third Man's Holly Martins. Here he digs into the character and you'll either find it unconvincing in the 40's sense or a knockout. As for Teresa Wright she finds some good notes as well in playing off of Cotten even in the earlier scenes. And those kids are just the right icing to the cake the film cooks up.It may take a couple of viewings to really warm up to this film or you may like it right away. But Shadow of a Doubt contains not only fine acting but also some trademark Hitchcock camera stylizing. My favorites included a particular shot closing in from medium closeup to extreme closeup on Uncle Charlie when he's in a memorable monologue at the dinner table. Another is the use of the dark value on the characters when they talk outside. And of course a climax that is genuine in theatricality. A".

This allows Hitch to pull off his famous 'twists' throughout the course of the movie hitting you every now and then with something you simply weren't expecting.One of my favourite elements in the movie is the ongoing dialogue between Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn avid mystery readers who are constantly discussing the best ways to murder each other.  Apart from being a bit of comic relief in an otherwise very dark film it also demonstrates how lightly people think of murder and murderers...until they encounter them facetoface.My advice then if you want to see this movie is not to learn anything about it beforehand.  Going in with no knowledge will increase the movie's initial impact and will help you to appreciate why Hitchcock was the 'Master of Suspense'.  This is a taut thriller with no gratuitous violence foul language or mature situations.Hitch considered it 'a family film'.Enjoy!".

	schema:headline " Dark and brooding thriller from the master of suspense";
	schema:reviewBody "It is well known that this film is Alfred Hitchcock's favourite of his own oeuvre and it's a big favourite of mine also. It is also well documented that for this film Hitchcock stated that he wants to bring violence back into the home where it belongs and he has certainly succeeded at doing that. Hitchcock spends much of the early screen time building up the family at the centre of the tale and then allowing the violence to come to them which shows Hitchcock's mastery of the medium as showing the story develop in this way makes the tale much more frightening than if we hadn't got to know the family at the centre of the story first. Joseph Cotten stars as uncle Charlie a man fleeing Philadelphia to escape the law after marrying and then murdering several rich widows. He goes to stay with his sister and her family which includes a husband two young children and the eldest daughter his niece and namesake also called 'Charlie'.Hitchcock puts the focus of the story on young Charlie and her relationship with her uncle. This gives the story a frightening angle as it follows the classic tale of the strange uncle. It's also well done as young Charlie is shown to be the sweetest of characters and when the dark uncle Charlie enters the fray her sweet world is infected by nightmares which also gives way to elements of the classic 'coming of age' tale to enter the proceedings. As if that wasn't enough Shadow of a Doubt also exposes the trust we put in our loved ones and how any person is likely to try and shift the blame or ignore it completely if their loved one has done wrong. This is shown by the way that young Charlie still attempts to cover for her beloved uncle even when all the evidence is pointing to him being guilty. Hitchcock has turned this thriller which could easily have been routine into a complex study of a family that retains it's interest throughout due to the multiple themes on display.Joseph Cotten was the absolute perfect choice to play uncle Charlie. His portrayal is picture perfect he carries with him an atmosphere of dread and morbidity throughout even when he's not doing anything wrong. A role of this sort is difficult to get right as it's all to easy to underplay it so it isn't effective or to overstate it so it becomes ridiculous but Cotten gets the performance spot on. Teresa Wright who stars alongside Cotten in the role of the other Charlie also does well and delivers a mature and assured performance that fits her character brilliantly. Some of the supporting roles look a little suspect at times but on the whole the acting from the support is good enough.The ending of the film comes somewhat against the run of play and is maybe a little bit too over the top after the rest of the film which is largely down to earth. However it does work and a big ending isn't something I am in the habit of complaining about. This is up there with Hitchcock's best work and therefore is highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Brilliance From Hitchcock  Cotten";
	schema:reviewBody "Shadow of a Doubt is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most brilliant and most carefullyconstructed films and is further notable as one of the very finest performances of Joseph Cotten in his role as Uncle Charlie.  Both the movie and the central character are thoughtprovoking and rich in detail.The film has an intriguing form that Hitchcock used a number of times for example in Strangers on a Train and Frenzy that of setting up carefully constructed contrasts between two main characters contrasts that in turn reflect a further complex of themes in the movie's broader setting and story.  Here the central contrast comes from the relationship between Uncle Charlie and his niece young Charlie Teresa Wright.  Their unusually close relationship creates tension and intrigue that go beyond the basic concern of the main storyline which is namely whether Uncle Charlie is the elusive serial killer sought by the police.  The uncleniece relationship also mirrors a great many other topics explored by the film most obviously the contrast between the smalltown atmosphere of Santa Rosa where Uncle Charlie has come to hide out with his sister's family but also the complicated nature of the other relationships that we see.  A fine supporting cast led by Henry Travers Patricia Collinge and Hume Cronyn help us focus in on hidden aspects of smalltown family and neighborhood life.Shadow of a Doubt is less known and celebrated than Hitchcock's 50's and early 60's work and even than some of his 30's British films most probably because it does not contain any of the director's famous set pieces which were already a part of his pictures well before Shadow of a Doubt was made.  After all it is a movie about a suspected serial killer and not only do we never see him kill anyone he never even tries anything violent until much later in the film.  But what Shadow of a Doubt lacks in the spectacular it makes up in tension and characterization especially in Cotten's brilliant performance.  He is by turns charming calculating suspicious and menacing a balance very difficult to maintain with credibility for an entire film.  Cotten's skill and Hitchcock's direction make Uncle Charlie one of Hitchcock's most memorable characters.Though more slowpaced than most of the famous director's works this is still one of his greatest and should be very satisfying to any fan of Hitchcock of Cotten or of noirishcrime thrillers.".

Uncle Charlie's urbanity becomes his most frightening feature. So plausible. So real. Thornton Wilder was Hitchcock's partner in crime this time and it shows. The structure is Our Townish the characters deliciously rich. Patricia Collinge's performance is so spot on that you're longing for more. The scenes between Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn are how I imagine the story meetings between Thornton Wilder and Alfred Hitchcock. Teresa Wright's eyes tell the whole story from the audience's point of view even if the audience is one step ahead of her. Brilliant because in Joseph Cotten's eyes we find his need for redemption or are we falling in the trap of this master manipulator? We are torn just like Teresa Wright. I've seen Shadow of a Doubt 3 or 4 times but every time you're forced to take the trip with the same amount of commitment. I've been toying with the thought of a remake I've been doing this lately although I hate the idea of remakes of great movies this one is one of those that in the right hands could have a real impact. Using Thornton Wilder's original script as the Bible Steven Sodebergh could do scrumptious remake for the new millennium. Tim Robbins as uncle Charlie can you imagine? Natalie Portman as his niece. Joan Cusak and William H Macy as her parents. Wouldn't you go to see that?".

This much steadier morally ringfenced world has it's own version of Uncle Charlie in the eldest daughter by the same name. Teresa Wright a dead ringer for Ellen Page has all his sensitivity but none of his frontline experience of life.

	schema:reviewBody "Shadow of a Doubt is classified as a Film Noir thriller. While I can see elements of film noir and elements of the thriller genre in this film I think this film is more of a character study. It's a story about what happens when a soulmate turns out to be somebody unexpected.The cast is excellent and the lead characters  played by Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright  are very well imagined written and portrayed. Both characters called for sweeping and dramatic personality changes which Wright and Cotten pulled off convincingly. Wright plays a very young woman 19ish living with her family and sort of depressed and aimless while Cotten is her namesake and favorite uncle Charlie. Uncle Charlie has come to visit and brought good cheer to the entire family but shortly after his arrival young Charlie begins to discover that Uncle Charlie has some sinister secrets. As the clues begin to add up to a coherent conclusion Wright's character is forced to decide what to do about her growing troublesome understanding.In typical Hitchcockian fashion the film toys with its audience for the first 34ths and does not reveal itself until its almost too late  playing on paranoia misleading and ambiguous dialog and terrific acting to create equivocation. However as you will see this is not the standard Hitchcock stuff  in the end it has more to do with the characters and what they do than the action and resolution of the ingenious plot.The Hitch' blows me away almost every time and Shadow of a Doubt is one of his best. If you haven't seen it you should. It's a very thoughtful and exquisitely executed character study about a very young and very bright woman encountering the heavy side of life for the first time and the choices she makes. Worth seeing for Wright's performance alone easily Oscarworthy Shadow of a Doubt is a timeless piece of noiresquire originality.".

Wright plays a very young woman 19ish living with her family and sort of depressed and aimless while Cotten is her namesake and favorite uncle Charlie. Uncle Charlie has come to visit and brought good cheer to the entire family but shortly after his arrival young Charlie begins to discover that Uncle Charlie has some sinister secrets. As the clues begin to add up to a coherent conclusion Wright's character is forced to decide what to do about her growing troublesome understanding.In typical Hitchcockian fashion the film toys with its audience for the first 34ths and does not reveal itself until its almost too late  playing on paranoia misleading and ambiguous dialog and terrific acting to create equivocation. However as you will see this is not the standard Hitchcock stuff  in the end it has more to do with the characters and what they do than the action and resolution of the ingenious plot.The Hitch' blows me away almost every time and Shadow of a Doubt is one of his best. If you haven't seen it you should. It's a very thoughtful and exquisitely executed character study about a very young and very bright woman encountering the heavy side of life for the first time and the choices she makes. Worth seeing for Wright's performance alone easily Oscarworthy Shadow of a Doubt is a timeless piece of noiresquire originality.";

I must be very careful with what I reveal of the story for it is important for the viewer to be'deceived' when they first 'meet' the characters.Starting with the look of the film well things definitely aren't what they seem. I liked the setting of the town. It really captured that smalltown feel. The music was a little over the top at times but then again it does add to the Hitchockian feel. Camerawork is exceptionally good.The screenplay is solid. I especially liked the dialogues and how toned they were. The comic relief is very well placed and it certainly had me laughing. The performances are remarkable. Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten are superb. Their on screen interaction is intriguing and brilliantly executed. Patricia Collinge is outstanding as the mother and sister. Hume Cronyn is very funny.I only thought that the portrayal of the two detectives was a little odd. They were quite stupid. In addition the romance between the detective and young Charley felt rushed.So there are a couple of little flaws but 'Shadow of a Doubt' still is among Hitchcock's awesome pictures. Hitchock himself said that it's his favourite film and I can see why.".

	schema:headline " When Hitchcock Comes to Middle America";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been reported that the primary appeal of doing Shadow of a Doubt for Alfred Hitchcock was the idea of bringing a sense of menace to a small every day American town. In that this movie brilliantly succeeds. It doesn't join Rear Window or Psycho as one of my favorite Hitchcock films but it has much to recommend it.Joseph Cotten didn't get many chances to play a sinister villain but he's very good at it. His natural ease and charm work to his advantage in creating a smarmy character who you're never completely sure about. He has a lot of chemistry with Teresa Wright who plays his niece and supposedly has a closer than normal connection with him. In fact in typical Hitchcock fashion their relationship in the early scenes of this film takes on a sort of creepy romantic quality that's never overtly addressed but is always there as subtext.As Wright begins to suspect that her Uncle Charlie might not be such a great guy after alland may in fact be much worse than simply not a great guythe balance of power shifts and she begins to play against him. One of the things I liked most about this movie was how strong a character Wright's Charlie is allowed to be. She's not a ninny like a character in her situation would be in any number of other films. She doesn't swoon cry and squeal helplessly. After Uncle Charlie tries to kill her by locking her in a garage with a running car and she comes to looking directly into his face she doesn't bite her knuckles as you might expect but rather says with a cold hard determination Go away. It's very effective and the whole movie is like that.It has a great supporting cast both well cast and acted. There's not a throwaway character among the bunch and everyone makes much of varying sized roles. Patricia Collinge is a stand out as Uncle Charlie's sister whose radar is going off even as she doesn't want to believe anything sinister can be happening. Henry Travers is the father of the family...his attitudes toward Charlie change after he comes to the bank where he works and makes inappropriate jokes. It wasn't until the end credits that I even realized who Hume Cronyn was playing I've never seen him so young.Shadow of a Doubt isn't as obviously distinguished visually as other Hitchcock films but it bears his unmistakable mark nonetheless. There aren't as many shots you come away from the film remembering as there are in say Rear Window. But the whole thing has the feeling of being completely controlled from beginning to end. I really liked the way smalltown America was portrayed in this film. It's not full of a bunch of rubes who say things like aw shucks and do silly things for us to laugh at. Hitchcock is skillful at showing the contrast between the smalltown life of young Charlie's family and Uncle Charlie's jaded bigcity life of crime. But he doesn't condescend or patronize.If you want to see highertier Hitchcock you could do much worse than this film. It's got an engaging story wonderful acting and complex characters and a few scenes that qualify as genuine nail biters. Very good! Grade A".

The story unfolds at a pace which is consistent with the sleepy surroundings in which it's set and contains moments of menace misogyny conflict and black humour. An uneasy atmosphere also prevails as it becomes increasingly apparent that beneath the community's respectable veneer something very dangerous exists.Charlie Newton Teresa Wright is a teenage girl who suffers extreme boredom living in an environment where everything is well ordered and predictable and she longs desperately for some excitement. The promise of this soon comes when her favourite uncle from Philadelphia arrives to stay with her family. Uncle Charles Joseph Cotten is a charming and successful businessman her mother's brother and also the member of the family after whom she was named. Their names are not all that Charlie and her uncle share as they're also connected by a telepathic link and an example of this is seen when Uncle Charles gives his niece a ring and she starts to hum the same piece of music that he had on his mind at the time The Merry Widow Waltz.Soon after Uncle Charles' arrival the family is visited by two men who work for a national polling organisation and they arrange with Mrs Newton Patricia Collinge for the entire family to be interviewed and photographed but Uncle Charles is clearly uncomfortable about this and refuses to cooperate. One of the men Jack Graham MacDonald Carey later dates Charlie and confides in her that he's actually a detective who's checking up on her uncle as he's one of two suspects that are under investigation. Charlie is also then asked not to tell her family about the investigation.When her uncle hides a page from her father's newspaper Charlie goes to the local library peruses their copy and finds that the page in question carried a story about a hunt being carried out for the Merry Widow Murderer. Furthermore she discovers that the initials engraved on the ring she was given by her uncle match those of one of the murder victims. A nightmare she has about her uncle running away from something a speech he gives at dinner about his hatred of widows and his attitude to taking part in the survey all serve to strengthen her strong suspicions that he's a murderer.Charlie's suspicions and the fact that she's unable to warn her family about the danger that lurks in their midst make her increasingly anxious and creates a conflict within her as she struggles to reconcile her contradictory impulses. Things get even worse however when Uncle Charles realises what Charlie knows and as a consequence her life is put in jeopardy.Knowing just how devastating it would be for her mother to find out the unpalatable truth about her favourite brother Charlie readily cooperates with the detectives in a plan to resolve their case in a way which avoids scandal and saves her family from being disgraced by the associated fall out.The suspense in this movie is relieved periodically by some humorous moments which mostly arise from the exchanges between Charlie's father Joseph Henry Travers and his neighbour Herbie Hugh Cronyn who are both avid murder mystery buffs who enjoy discussing ideas for committing the perfect murder.The two characters at the heart of this story seem so strongly connected that they're almost like one entity within which good and evil naivety and sophistication and also innocence and wickedness all coexist. This is symptomatic of the theme of duality which is present throughout the entire film and can be seen in the number of doubles featured two Charlies two detectives two suspects two attempts on Charlie's life etc.High angle shots are used effectively at certain points but the one in the library when Charlie has just discovered the information about the Merry Widow Murderer is outstanding. Similarly interesting use is made of closeups but the one which makes the most impact is seen when Uncle Charles makes his speech in which he viciously attacks the lifestyles and appearances of wealthy widows.The talented cast bring their characters to life convincingly and the events which follow Charlie's craving for excitement bring to mind the advice to be careful what you wish for.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't believe Shadow of a Doubt will rank as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best film. But second rank Hitchcock is better than most people's best efforts. Joseph Cotten has come for a visit to Santa Rosa California to see his sister Patricia Collinge and her family. They welcome him as the prodigal brother. But his very perceptive niece named after him played by Teresa Wright suspects something is wrong with this picture.Uncle Charlie is suspected of being a serial killer with the monniker of The Merry Widow Killer. He strangles rich old widows and robs them. I guess it's a living albeit one with risks.Those risks are getting to him and on some levels you see Cotten almost wants to be caught. In fact Teresa starts to suspect him over a trivial incident involving her dad's paper. Cotten goes to great lengths to hide a feature story about The Merry Widow Murders. When she goes to the library to see what was in the paper that he didn't want the family to see this is when she starts figuring it out.Really all Cotten had to do is nothing. But he really did want it to end. I'm not sure any player ever had such an auspicious beginning in such top rated films as Teresa Wright. In the space of three years she appeared in The Little Foxes Mrs. Miniver Pride of the Yankees and now Shadow of a Doubt. She's a Nancy Drew if Nancy had ever discovered there was a criminal who was a close relative.Patricia Collinge essentially repeats her role from The Little Foxes. If she's not quite as daft as Miss Birdie she's still kind of operating within her own world. Henry Travers does fine as her husband as does Hume Cronyn as his partner in their own make believe world of crime.Of course giving a big assist to Ms. Wright's suspicions is the presence of detectives MacDonald Carey and Wallace Ford. They are a team chasing Cotten as one of two men they think is the Merry Widow Killer.One thing with this film is that unlike Suspicion Hitchcock stood firm and did not bow to pressure to exonerate Cotten like he did with Cary Grant in the previous film. Of course Cotten was fairly new to the cinema so he could be cast as a villain. And Hitchcock does what he does best toy with the audiences emotions. Like Suspicion when a whole lot of things happen to Teresa Wright they can be explained away and there is that red herring of that other suspect across the continent.Of course the other part of Shadow of a Doubt is how the thing is resolved in regard to Cotten's family. The ending might be a bit too pat but still it does tie up the loose ends in the best way for all concerned.".

Admittedly there are some dull stretchesbut midway through the story the relationship between Cotten and Wright gets us caught in the story and we have to follow it to conclusion.

	schema:reviewBody "SHADOW OF A DOUBT 1943 UNIVERSAL This film is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock picture. From most accounts it's Hitch's favorite as well. It is very tough to pick a favorite from his fantastic body of work but this one has always affected me personally. Growing up in a small town whether it be Santa Rosa CA. where this film is set or any other small town in North America is an experience that stays with you no matter how far you go away from home how successful you may become or long you have been away from home. It is a very nostalgic film  a very frightening film at the same time. Only Hitchcock could have pulled this film off. In lesser hands this would have been just another studio potboiler of the era.This is the story of a serial killer  prodigal son who comes home to sleepy Santa Rosa to lie low. Uncle Charlie Joseph Cotten is adored by his family especially his niece Charlotte Charlie Teresa Wright. The close bond between these two leads to a delicious cat  mouse game that eventually pits niece against uncle good against evil.Hitch's shows that even in small town America this evil can reside. When Cotten is dressing down his niece as he realizes that she is on to him he delivers a cynical monologue ending with Do you know if you rip off the fronts of house you'd find swine? The world's a hell. What does it matter what happens in it? To this very day that scene makes my skin crawl.The cast is top rate. Joseph Cotten is as good here as he was in Citzen Kane or The 3rd Man. Beautiful Teresa Wright gives her finest performance in only her 4th film. She is a very underrated  underappreciated actress. Hume Cronyn in his film debut Herbie Hawkins  Henry Travers Charlie's father give the film the right touch of black comedy relief as mystery novel buffs who are constantly trying to come up with the perfect way to kill someone. Macdonald Carey Detective Jack Graham  Patricia Collinge Charlie's mother are also well cast. Also look for Hitch's cameo which has him playing cards on the train to Santa Rosa.Hitchcock's direction keeps the film moving at the right pace  brings you into story as if you were living in Santa Rosa  watching all of this unravel from your front porch. Thorton Wilder Sally Benson  Hitch's wife Alma Reville paint the picture with marvelous dialog adapted from Gordon McDonell's original story. Joseph Valentine's photography on this film is stunning. The contrasting scenes of Uncle Charlie in bed at his flop house hotel  Charlie in bed in her home drives home the point of good vs. evil without a word of dialog. This film also began the long partnership of Hitch  legendary composer Dimitri Tiomkin.Rating 10 Stars".

The sleepy town of Santa Rosa is far removed from the very real events of WW2 events that figured at least a mention if not a central influence on most films of that period. Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo were also far removed from the realities of the Cold War and the Communist WitchHunts of the 50's.Shadow is taut with sexual tension  the incestuous overtones of the mental affinity of niece and uncle Charlie the lusty infatuations of Charlie's teenage friend Catherine and Herb who just happens to be around the corner where ever we see Charlie. Charlie the niece is played by Teresa Wright in one of Hitchcock's best female performances. She is very warm innocent and genuinely goodnatured  completely unlike Hitch's usual icy blonds. I have always found Joseph Cotten to be quite inexpressive. He is slightly better than his usual self and is believable in charming and winning over the small townfolk.This is probably Hitchcock's only film with a strong human core coupled with his wellknown skills as a master technician. What other director of the era could have revealed the murderer at the start of the film and still maintained tension and a lingering unease throughout. Shadow of a Doubt is a precursor to the menace of Blue Velvet and the sexual tensions of American Beauty  and stays with you much longer than either of them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh...how annoyed I was after watching this movie. Heralded as Hitchcock's finest I was impressed by the IMDb.com score it received and I settled in for a wonderful film noirsuspense experience. What resulted was a blatantly boring linear plot wmany unbelievable plot points that were very annoying and an unsatisfying ending. First I will mention the one great thing about this film the plot which is superb in its own right although poorly executed by the Shadow in this case and the acting of Joseph Cotton. I watched Cotton in other filmsvery bland in Gaslight for example and thought he did an outstanding job showing uneasiness with the fear of being suspected as the murderous villain. So great acting range from him made the movie tolerable. This is about all the praise the movie deserves. The beginning reels you in with a clever and suspenseful look at Cotton hiding out in his rented room trying to avoid men pursuing him. The interest vanishes however in the viewer when Cotton arrives to California to visithide out with his family. What follows is the niece's attempt at discovering why her uncle Cotton is acting so strangely. Suddenly this innocent girl transforms into a Sherlock Holmes with an esplike ability to guesspredict everything about her uncle's doingsidentity. Other than Cotton the rest of the acting is forgettable in the movie. Somehow wno explanation the cops are hot on Cotton's trail!! He traveled from east coast to west coast and within a short time the cops know who he is and where he is?? The problem with this movie is there is just no suspense also I felt it was impossible that a smart criminal like Cotton was outsmarted by his younginnocent niece with really no hard facts to go on. These are the little details that kept happening throughout the movie that made it very unsatisfying. Oh yeah and what really nailed it for me was the ending Cotton struggles whis niece on a train between the carts and she shoves him to his death off the train done watrocious special effects by the way. A 6ft 2in 200lb man being outwrestled by his 5ft 5 100lb niece? I would not mind this lack of believability if it was a minor part in a movie that served to advance some minor plot point but this was THE most important part of the movie the climax where it all ends and comes to a point. It was a huge letdown. If you enjoy a good story find a book version of this movie because Hitchcock's linear approach makes it all but impossible to be surprised at what happens for the next hour and a half of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 2001 American Outlaws is yet another rendition of Jesse James Cole Younger and their Gang. This one focuses on the end of the Civil War and the first few years of the gang's activitieswhich lasted a whole decade in reality from 186676 ending with the foiled Northfield Minnesota bank robbery on September 7 1876. Jesse  Frank escaped while the others were captured or died. While Frank tried to settle down to a normal life in Virginia Jesse restarted the gang in 1879 but was shot by Robert Ford one of his trusted gang members on April 3 1882.American Outlaws is highlighted by a great cast with palpable chemistry including Colin Farrell as Jesse Scott Caan aka 'Danno' as Cole the beautiful Ali Larter as Zee Jesse's girlfriendwife and Timothy Dalton as the lead Pinkerton. Gabriel Macht Will McCormack Nathaniel Arcand and Gregory Smith are also on hand as notable members of the gang. The film plays it fairly serious accented by a fun joie de vivre spirit sorta like Indiana Jones in the wild West. You can tell the cast had a blast during filming. This is the exact opposite of the grim The Long Riders from 1980 which is arguably the best and most accurate film about the JamesYounger Gang. As far as historical accuracy goes with American Outlaws well there was a group of outlaws in Missouri called the JamesYounger Gang and they did rob banks trains and stagecoaches in Missouri Kentucky Iowa Texas Arkansas Kansas West Virginia and Minnesota whereas Jesse's later group continued the gangs' criminal legacy in Alabama Missouri Louisiana and Mississippi other than this the historicity is pretty butchered for the sake of rousing Western entertainment. See The Long Riders for a more austere and accurate version of the tale.BOTTOM LINE Even though American Outlaws loses points for inaccuracies and implausibilities it scores high in overall entertainment value. It's a turnoffyourbrainandhaveablast kind of Western. The movie performed poorly at the box office in 2001 and Roger Ebert gave it a scathing review. Ebert compared it to 1972's The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid which he praised. This was strange because that film wasn't exactly realistic either in fact it's a veritable parody or black comedy. These movies shouldn't be compared in the first place since American Outlaws details the gang's first year in action and The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid the gang's final bank robbery a whole decade later. Furthermore the two films are expressly opposite in tone American Outlaws makes the wild West largerthanlife and ALMOST fun while the other film deglamorizes it making it profane ugly and idiotic. In any event American Outlaws is seriously rollicking Western lore worthy of one's video library. The film was shot in CentralEast Texas great locations by the way and runs a shortbutsweet 94 minutes.GRADE B".

	schema:reviewBody "There is just something about seeing a western that has real characters in it.  What is it about outlaws that peaks our interest?  What was it about Jesse James that made people love him so much?  Was he really as benevolent as he was made to be in this film?  Was he really as crazy and theological as he was in the Rob LoweBill Paxton film Frank and Jesse?  I'm not really sure I would probably have to guess he was somewhere in between.  In American Outlaws Jesse is played rather blandly by Colin Ferrel.  I can honestly say that I wasn't overly interested in Jesse James in this film the way I was in Frank and Jesse.  Rob Lowe had a much more complete interpretation of outlaw Jesse James.  But what may be lacking in the leads is more than made up for in some of the supporting characters and for that I would say that American Outlaws is almost worth seeing.  Not quite but if you have nothing better to do with 10.00 go see this film.Gabriel Macht plays Jesse's older brother Frank and Timothy Dalton of James Bond fame plays Alan Pinkerton the man responsible for hunting down the James gang.  Macht plays Frank James as the older and much wiser brother. He calmly solves disputes writes and plans many of the heists and robberies and helps Jesse court the love of his life.  Yet he is not there to take the spotlight away from his brother or from Cole Younger.  Frank is basically a peacemaker.  I enjoyed Macht's performance and when he was on screen the picture was a lot more interesting.  He adds some needed credibility to a somewhat lame film.  When you have great actresses like Kathy Bates looking disasterous in their small roles you know you are in trouble.  I don't know if you can attribute all of this to the director Les Mayfield but it has to start somewhere.  The actors weren't really allowed to shine and maybe a few more takes should have been filmed before deciding on which one to use.Two other actors stood out as well and one of them was Timothy Dalton.  He seemed a little out of place in this film.  He just looked as though he was one step ahead of everyone else and just seemed to know something that we didn't.  He could make you think that just by a smirk or a tone of voice or a tip of his black fedora.  He is evil conniving and yet he has some admiration for the JamesYounger gang.  He can empathize with their situation but his job is to hunt them down and kill them.  I would like to see Dalton in more roles like this he was fun to watch in this film.  Also intriguing to watch is Will McCormack as Bob Younger.  He is unfamiliar to me but anyone who watches The Sopranos religiously will recognize him from a few episodes.  I thought he was believable in his smaller role as one of the Younger brothers.  At first he comes off as being a little slow but his character builds towards the end and eventually he turns out to be one of the stronger characters.It's a shame that American Outlaws couldn't build a better script around these three characters because they seemed better than the script they were given.  American Outlaws isn't a bad film it's not really a great one either but it is worth a look.  If anything it will make you want to go home and pop in your copy of Tombstone and remember what it is like to have compelling Western characters.6 out of 10could be better could be worse.".

He rode with Bloody Bill Anderson and William Quantrill who were Confederate raiders who performed unspeakable atrocities in the name of slavery. James was no Robin Hood. He was in it for the money.

	schema:reviewBody "Smart energetic funny exciting and underrated these are just a few adjectives that describe American Outlaws a western that will take everyone by surprise. Colin Farrell is a breath of fresh air and Gabriel Macht is a pure delight as they take the reigns in one of the funniest westerns I have seen.Farrell and Macht are joined by Scott Caan Timothy Dalton Kathy Bates and Ali Larter whose comedic intelligence and intense talent to create a film that is rich in character driven performances.Most of the credit must be given to the writers of American Outlaws because they took the western genre and created one of the most unique westerns in recent years through the addition of humor. With actionpacked sequences strong performances and smart writing the writers made the audience look at westerns in a whole new way clever and stylish.Though I feel originality is important in any film I see it is not always necessary for a film to succeed. American Outlaws contains many clich ridden scenes but the true genius of this film is the presentation of the film.Inspired by actual events American Outlaws takes the audience on a comedic journey through the lives of the JamesYounger gang and their battle with Allan Pinkerton and the railroad.The success of American Outlaws partially stems from the great ensemble performance provided by Farrell Macht Larter Caan Bates and Dalton. It was apparent from the start that the American Outlaws cast gave maximum effort was going to take me on a satisfying comedy thrill ride through the Old West. It was clear that the cast of American Outlaws had fun together making the film so when this occurs everyone is guaranteed the film will bring satisfaction.Charisma intensity and courage these are the elements brought to the screen by the latest breakout star. I must admit it took me awhile to get over the shock of watching a charismatic youthful looking actor steal the spotlight from his talented costars but that is exactly what occurred with Farrell in American Outlaws. American Outlaws allows Farrell the opportunity to step out of the shadows into the limelight to take his place among the best young actors in Hollywood.It didn't take long to realize the discovery of the next big movie star would be found in American Outlaws with proof coming from Farrell's energetic and fun performance as Jesse James. I was smiling when I saw Farrell on screen because it meant the writers had created a character filled with imagination and ideas that made the movie a joy to watch.Aside from Farrell another bright spot in American Outlaws shined with the emergence and second breakthrough performance turned in by his costar Gabriel Macht. With enormous screen presence and impact turned in by Macht this is an actor who will soon hear his name called as a winner of the coveted academy award.Rounding out American Outlaws is the addition of Timothy Dalton and Kathy Bates. Commendations must given to Dalton for making the character of Allan Pinkerton a delight to watch. It didn't take me long to recognize that he was the right man for the job. With his look demeanor and presence Dalton confirmed my suspicions.A short appearance can sometimes be the most memorable as with the case of the actress who portrayed Ma James. Bates has always been a favorite of mine because she brings credibility to each film she stars in.

	onyx:emotionText "Smart energetic funny exciting and underrated these are just a few adjectives that describe American Outlaws a western that will take everyone by surprise. Colin Farrell is a breath of fresh air and Gabriel Macht is a pure delight as they take the reigns in one of the funniest westerns I have seen.Farrell and Macht are joined by Scott Caan Timothy Dalton Kathy Bates and Ali Larter whose comedic intelligence and intense talent to create a film that is rich in character driven performances.Most of the credit must be given to the writers of American Outlaws because they took the western genre and created one of the most unique westerns in recent years through the addition of humor. With actionpacked sequences strong performances and smart writing the writers made the audience look at westerns in a whole new way clever and stylish.Though I feel originality is important in any film I see it is not always necessary for a film to succeed. American Outlaws contains many clich ridden scenes but the true genius of this film is the presentation of the film.Inspired by actual events American Outlaws takes the audience on a comedic journey through the lives of the JamesYounger gang and their battle with Allan Pinkerton and the railroad.The success of American Outlaws partially stems from the great ensemble performance provided by Farrell Macht Larter Caan Bates and Dalton. It was apparent from the start that the American Outlaws cast gave maximum effort was going to take me on a satisfying comedy thrill ride through the Old West. It was clear that the cast of American Outlaws had fun together making the film so when this occurs everyone is guaranteed the film will bring satisfaction.Charisma intensity and courage these are the elements brought to the screen by the latest breakout star. I must admit it took me awhile to get over the shock of watching a charismatic youthful looking actor steal the spotlight from his talented costars but that is exactly what occurred with Farrell in American Outlaws. American Outlaws allows Farrell the opportunity to step out of the shadows into the limelight to take his place among the best young actors in Hollywood.It didn't take long to realize the discovery of the next big movie star would be found in American Outlaws with proof coming from Farrell's energetic and fun performance as Jesse James. I was smiling when I saw Farrell on screen because it meant the writers had created a character filled with imagination and ideas that made the movie a joy to watch.Aside from Farrell another bright spot in American Outlaws shined with the emergence and second breakthrough performance turned in by his costar Gabriel Macht. With enormous screen presence and impact turned in by Macht this is an actor who will soon hear his name called as a winner of the coveted academy award.Rounding out American Outlaws is the addition of Timothy Dalton and Kathy Bates. Commendations must given to Dalton for making the character of Allan Pinkerton a delight to watch. It didn't take me long to recognize that he was the right man for the job. With his look demeanor and presence Dalton confirmed my suspicions.A short appearance can sometimes be the most memorable as with the case of the actress who portrayed Ma James. Bates has always been a favorite of mine because she brings credibility to each film she stars in. With American Outlaws Bates role is short sweet and to the point.The bottom line is American Outlaws is an underrated film that will bring everyone pure satisfaction and serve as great entertainment.";

The acting was incredible when kept in mind that it was such a young main cast with the exception of the older wellknowns that came in to take on some of the other opposing heavy roles. I really like Ronny Cox and was glad to see him as a good guy in this even though he can portray a villain like noneother when called for. I also like Harris Yulin a lot so it was always a pleasure to see him as well. Colin Farrell seemed to actually live this role which is why he was perfect for it. I'd have to say that his acting talent has sagged to a lower level in his recent choices though. Maybe he became lazier or doesn't feel the need to try as hard anymore...who knows!? The action scenes were believable even if they were by no means near an epicsized proportion. Ali Larter is pretty hot and is a decent actress! I'm really surprised she isn't in a lot more films because she definitely has my vote! She's realistic and is able to keep forming varying reactions to the different situations she encounters. Overall a much better movie than I thought and am glad I finally got a chance to enjoy it.Final TrailMovies Not worth the high ticket prices.DVD Purchase No only for the reason that I'd only watch it a couple more times in this life.Rental Makes for a great adventure night!".

	schema:reviewBody "You know it makes me laugh when I read other people's negative reviews on this movie. Yeah this movie is riddled with historical inaccuracies and all the outlaws are so darn young and good looking but hey that's not the point. I don't think this movie was meant to be a serious study about Frank and Jesse James. This movie was made strictly to entertain and to make people laugh.One already knows from the first five minutes into the movie that this is a comedyaction movie. I enjoyed it for what it was mindless entertainment! Yeah Colin Farrell is HOT! As a matter of fact the rest of the outlaws are all very young and cute. Even if the females audience do not care much for the plot or for the cartoon violence I'm sure they would get some visceral thrill out of seeing all these good looking young guys together on the screen. The male audience will enjoy the humor and the fight scenes and big explosions and Ali Larter the pretty blonde actress that plays Zee. Ali Larter reminds me of the models in the old 1970s' shampoo commercials all shiny blonde hair and big smiles.This movie was fun to watch from beginning to end. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a fun action comedy.By the way now that the DVD is out I hope everyone catches the deleted scenes from the movie. They are very good. It's a shame these scenes were not included into the movie they would've showed a little more depth to the characters of Frank and Jesse James.".

The latest iteration of the story is American Outlaws a redblooded Bstyle shoot'emup that offers little in the way of historical accuracy and even less in the way of storytelling elegance but does serve up plenty of action and lots of fun.Jesse hot Irish newcomer Colin Farrell makes a name for himself on the battlefields of the Civil War as an unpredictable live wire willing to do anything to get the Yankees.  After the war he and his levelheaded sureshot brother Frank Gabriel Macht return to their home in Liberty Missouri only to find the railroad coming through town.  The big rail money backed up by hardskulled detective Allen Pinkerton a glowering Timothy Dalton wants to buy the James farm but the boys aren't selling. They didn't shed their blood on the battlefields just to give their home over to a railroad.  Soon however it's back to war when a bomb destroys their farmhouse and the only way to get revenge is to strap on your guns and ride.  As they rob railroad payrolls and bedevil the authorities Jesse Frank and their gang get something besides revenge  they become authentic American legends.It's a story every schoolboy knows.  Hell Bobby Brady was a Jesse James aficionado.  Still it's been a while since we've had a telling of the story and this one does a fairly good job of keeping us entertained. Les Mayfield is not the obvious choice to direct a western his most notable previous film was Encino Man with Pauly Shore but he actually does a decent job.  He handles the action sequences with flair particularly a crackerjack bank shootout and Jesse's escape from the rail baron's train. The film's period accoutrements are all present and accounted for the costumes and guns appropriately impressive the cinematography by Russell Boyd all vibrant browns and golds.  There are also some nice performances from the mostly young cast.  Colin Farrell makes Jesse a likable oddly sweet kid whose charm is just as deadly as his gun.  Scott Caan matches him as the hotheaded Cole Younger more on him later and Gabriel Macht is a sensible and solid Frank his performance the best thing in the film.  Ali Larter is nice eye candy as Jesse's lady love but the story really gives her nothing to do and while Dalton growls impressively behind a grungylooking beard he doesn't really get the chance to do anything evil.  This is where American Outlaws starts shooting itself in the foot.  There is no real sense of a concrete enemy for the boys to battle a true and implacable adversary.  Harris Yulin blusters and barks as the railroad baron but he never truly emerges as a figure of loathing.  As a result the film's finale is unfocused and confusing.  Pinkerton's final action in particular makes no sense to me at all.  Is he just giving a cocky young kid the benefit of the doubt?  Is he doing it because Jesse's wife is hot?  I don't get it.American Outlaws is a frustrating film in some ways because everything you like is balanced by something that rubs you the wrong way.  A great Civil War battle opening is marred by the sparseness of the Union ranks Mayfield should have called for more extras that day.  An appropriately Coplandesque score by Trevor Rabin is almost wholly sabotaged by the inclusion of a Moby song MOBY! at both the beginning and the end of the film.  It almost makes you want to grab a sixgun yourself and blaze away at the troublemakers leaving behind only those who are contributing admirably to the enterprise. Still I've come to expect the good with the bad this summer and American Outlaws joins Tomb Raider and The Mummy Returns as a piece of escapism that is better than the critics' comments indicate but not as good as it probably should be.  Still with these flouncy dull MTV teen comedies STILL dominating the marketplace it's nice to see someone delivering a good old fashioned genre piece.  In these parlous cinematic times even a problematic western is better than no western at all.I close with a bit of real history  after they stopped riding with the James boys Cole Younger and his outlaws kept going and one time even attempted to rob a farmhouse in their area.  The woman of the house got the drop on them though she slammed a window on a gang member's hand costing him two of his fingers.  She survived to live a healthy long life and have children and grandchildren of her own.  One of those grandchildren was my grandmother.  Someone should put THAT in a movie.  It would make me happy.".

	schema:headline " The first Western film of the millennium is adoubleshooter!";
	schema:reviewBody "After what seemed to be a dearth of good Western films in the past 10 years AMERICAN OUTLAWS may just be the film to give the genre exactly what it needs  an injection of flair transfused with an updated story line that will appeal to this generation while keeping its Western roots intact.The last decent Western film was 1993's TOMBSTONE. Both a critical and financial disappointment too many duds followed in its steps. Kevin Costner's lavish and way overlong WYATT EARP Sharon Stone's turkey THE QUICK AND THE DEAD 1997's hitandmiss THE NEWTON BOYS 1999's big budget extravaganza WILD WILD WEST and last year's goof ball comedy SHANGHAI NOON are just some of the examples that come to mind. None of these films stayed true to the Western genre in fact they seem only to have been made in the hope of generating big box office dollars by pitting big named actors against a Western backdrop.And then there's AMERICAN OUTLAWS. A new Western film with little known actors and a smaller budget than most films. I must admit the idea of Colin Farrell playing a young Jesse James was rather interesting. After seeing him in last year's indiesmash TIGERLAND which I thought was one of 2000's best films I have become an avid fan and I will now see anything with him in it. Also being a big fan of Western films this movie was a MUST for me.After a town discovers that a railroad baron has taken the Deeds to their homesteads without their knowledge a group of young men decide to band together and take him on to set things right. Our unlikely heroes consist of the Younger brothers headed by Cole played by Scott Caan of VARSITY BLUES fame and the James brothers led by Jesse himself and his younger brother Frank. Both Cole and Jesse butt heads over leadership of the gang which will ultimately lead to bitter rivalry. Ali Larter of FINAL DESTINATION plays Jesse James' girlfriend Zee.When their adventure starts they will ultimately become wanted outlaws after they start robbing banks. Timothy Dalton plays Allan Pinkerton a man vowed to bringing them to justice. There is also a surprise cameo by Kathy Bates as the mother of the James brothers. This film will certainly deliver enough thrills and action to keep you interested the whole way through.Colin Farrell yet again pins down his role by displaying his wide range of talents and again mastering the US accent perfectly. He somehow carries the flair and likeability of Brad Pitt without being 'too' pretty while also having the ability to take on the difficult role of making us like a character who is actually a wrongdoer.I was most surprised by Ali Larter. Most recently she has a small role in LEGALLY BLONDE but it is her role in FINAL DESTINATION that first caught my attention. In that particular film she played a meek and quiet girl with long brown hair who had serious issues to deal with. Here she is a stunning gutsy blonde babe who has gumption and flair which goes to show that she is more than twodimensional when it comes to portraying different characters. I admired her in both of these movies and I predict that this is only the beginning of better things that will eventually come to her.Fortunately this film is not overly violent as such classics like THE WILD BUNCH or THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN which took pride in examining bloodshed and portraying the West as a dirty bloody landscape that leaves no soul left unharmed. Another bright point is the fact that this film contains next to no foul language at all which these days is quite a relief!. So this movie really isn't just a guy's flick because of all the shooting action and it isn't just a chick's flick because it stars two attractive upandcoming actors Farrell and Caan. This is a movie that I think will appeal to everyone.I was quite amazed at how much I enjoyed this movie. It is certainly a fresh alternative to all those teenflicks and grossout comedies that seem to be crowding our local megaplexes as of late.I highly recommend this to everyone.810".

I'm not sure why but this film was just bland most of the time and the actors despite some talented ones in the parts just seemed to walk through the performances as if they were simply trying to just get the whole thing over with. Even the versatile Timothy Dalton seemed to be at a lost as to what to do.And the characters themselves were terrible. By the end of the film we still knew nothing about any of them. I like to have at least some understanding of the characters in a film. Whether they're the good guys or the bad guys at least give me something about them to understand sympathize with or relate to. Sure Frank and Jessie wanted revenge for a personal tragedy but the depiction of that tragedy is handled so lazily we often forget about it for the rest of the film. The other characters tagging along with the brothers do so to make a stand against the railroad tycoon Harris Yulin but again we don't get anything from them personally to make us root for their success.A couple of the action scenes are nicelyexecuted if sometimes over the top. The Hyperion job is the standout sequence of the entire film as the JamesYounger gang must fight their way out of a trap while attempting to rob a bank. And Trevor Rabin's exciting score which I had already bought a few months ago and really enjoyed helped make some of the boring parts seem more important.Perhaps if the script had treated the material seriously and if the director had stayed awake during the shoot it might have at least passed as a good timewaster for a dull Saturday night.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the spirit of Young Guns  but more tongue in cheek and less interesting  American Outlaws is another chapter in Hollywood's inexplicable move to rehabilitate the reputations of the thugs of the Old West. In Young Guns it was Billy the Kid in American Outlaws it's Jesse James.I don't know why but this type of historical revisionism really grates on me. Jesse James was a thug a thief and a murderer. That about sums him up. But if anyone watching this movie took it seriously as history and some will believe that Hollywood wouldn't lie they'll get the impression that Jesse James was really a cool guy funloving even noble. Jesse's not the crook here. He's just out for justice against an evil oil baron. Even Pinkerton who spends the movie pursuing him ends up admiring him. Even the title gives it away Jesse James isn't just an outlaw he's an AMERICAN outlaw. There's something patriotic about this guy. Whatever.OK. Enough ranting. There's some decent shoot out action here if you're into that sort of thing a few amusing scenes and decent performances from Colin Farrell as Jesse and Timothy Dalton as Pinkerton. Stealing the show however was Gregory Smith as Jim Younger jealous because he's been so invisible in the criminal exploits of the gang that witnesses can't even give a good description of him for his Wanted poster. So there are a few good things about this movie but presenting Jesse James in this hero type way just doesn't sit well with me. 310".

In Young Guns it was Billy the Kid in American Outlaws it's Jesse James.I don't know why but this type of historical revisionism really grates on me. Jesse James was a thug a thief and a murderer. That about sums him up. But if anyone watching this movie took it seriously as history and some will believe that Hollywood wouldn't lie they'll get the impression that Jesse James was really a cool guy funloving even noble. Jesse's not the crook here. He's just out for justice against an evil oil baron. Even Pinkerton who spends the movie pursuing him ends up admiring him.

Probably the film closest to the actual facts is the one that starred Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter as Jesse and Frank James. American Outlaws however gives Cole Younger and his brothers their due. The Youngers were cousins of the James. Younger like Frank James lived past their outlaw days in the old west and died in bed.Colin Farrell in the way he plays Jesse is very suggestive of Tyrone Power in his reckless swashbuckling manner where he takes up the outlaw trade after losing his mother to railroad greed in grabbing up farms for a right of way. They messed with the wrong brothers because these guys learned about waging war under William Quantrill and his raiders. Some of southern persuasion say the James and Younger brothers were just the last rebels to surrender. Gabriel Macht plays a more loquacious and educated version than the most famous Frank James of all Henry Fonda.Scott Caan is Cole Younger and this is a man concerned with billing. No one is going to take any credit away from the Youngers in the exploits of the gang. Kathy Bates is the tragic James mother and Ali Larter is Jesse's wife Zerelda who in this version might have understudied Belle Starr.Timothy Dalton is Allan Pinkerton charged by the railroad with bringing in the outlaws any way he can. Unlike in a lot of versions Pinkerton is shown as ruthless but he has a healthy respect for the skill these outlaws employ. Harris Yulin plays the railroad president who is the author of all the miseries sustained by the JamesYounger gang.I'm actually surprised that another Jesse James film came out so soon after Rob Lowe essayed the part and did it well in his Jesse James film. Both are well done films in the spirit of the legend of Jesse James and his exploits.American Outlaws ain't history but it's a crackling good western.".

For me it's two main flaws were the way it was written almost like two 45 minute shorts spliced together and the fact that it ends abruptly in an unsatisfying manner.However the fact that it ends in such an unsatisfactory manner comes largely from how it gripped me up to that ending. This movie is saved by an utterly convincing turn from Fairuza Balk. Together with Robert Forster as a lunatic doctor obsessed with chance she drags the movie out of the 'okay for a quick watch psychothriller' rut it was so obviously heading into without her.As the sister of the doctor's last victim who winds up riding cross county with him all the while unaware of her sister's body shoved in his trunk Balk is riveting. In all honesty I can't think of a movie off the top of my head she wasn't good in and she saves the film.However in the event you don't enjoy the interplay between her and Forster there may not be too much in this film for you. Also worth noting is the fact that Balk is not introduced until halfway through the movie meaning that you could lose interest before she turns up.Basically I enjoyed this movie a lot once it got going but the first half is really just setup and pretty slow setup at that. However the second half of the movie is very good even if it does end in a way that doesn't really explain much of anything. This is a loosely plotted oddity that is saved by excellent turns from it's leads. If you watch without expecting miracles I'm sure you'll have a good enough time with it.".

However the second half of the movie is very good even if it does end in a way that doesn't really explain much of anything. This is a loosely plotted oddity that is saved by excellent turns from it's leads. If you watch without expecting miracles I'm sure you'll have a good enough time with it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'd heard so many different opinions about this movie. At first it sounded like just another psychokiller road movie although with a cast of some of the greatest actors around but then it got chosen for the Cannes film festival and won a bunch of other 'serious' awards. Anyway one night my mom and dad saw it at a festival and when they got home they were arguing like mad  my dad who hates EVERYTHING called it a masterpiece  my mom said it freaked her out and shouldn't have been made! After that I didn't know what to expect but I knew I had to see it. Well tonight I did and oh my God it turned me upsidedown. I wouldn't go so far as to call 'American Perfekt' a masterpiece but it's smart funny beautifully acted and directed and has moments of such straightfaced hilariously chilling brilliance that it made me remember why I love movies. I won't try and explain the plot in detail but Amanda Plummer plays a woman lost in the desert after her car is driven off the road by a mysterious car. She gets picked up by a criminal psychiatrist and a strange romance develops between them based on making all their decisions on the flip of a coin. Plummer is better than I've seen her since 'The Fisher King' and even more beautiful and Robert Forster is AWESOME! Better even than 'Jackie Brown'. David Thewlis is alternately funny creepy and downright sad. And watch out for Chris Sarandon too as a gentle Deputy to Paul Sorvino's gungho Sheriff  a great performance that reminds us why he got nominated for an Oscar once Dog Day Afternoon. The gorgeous Fairuza Balk is also excellent in a really intense performance much more mature than the usual flashier stuff she gets asked to do. Yeah 'American Perfekt' starts off slowly but only because it's lulling you into a false state of security while it's crawling under your skin. And writerdirector Paul Chart pulls it off without resorting to being 'above' his audience ie despite all the clever different layers to the film you never feel like it's trying to prove how smart it is  also everyone really looks like they're having fun. All in all 'American Perfekt' isn't so much a psycho 'art film' as a really neat and original movie that's been 'artfully made'. Give it chance and don't be afraid to laugh at how nightmarish it becomes. A warning to the fainthearted however  although Chart keeps the sex and violence fairly lowkey it has a habit of coming out of nowhere and is presented in such a matterof fact way that it WILL stay with you just ask my mom. There's another great score from Simon boswell too 'Shallow Grave' 'Trainspotting'.Now where did I put that shovel ....?".

Staggering out of the 80's with a coke hangover and indulgence fatigue we experienced somewhat of a revolution in cinema. What was once ridiculously overblown and selfaggrandising became understated simplified and strayed from the norm somewhat. We started referencing movies within our movies we turned our attention to the exploitation cinema of the preceding decades and the film noir of the early half of the 20th century.One of the subgenres which grew substantially in popularity was the road movie. The likes of True Romance 1993 Natural Born Killers 1994 Thelma  Louise 1991 and Kalifornia 1993 popularised the concept of taking the actions out of the city and onto the highways. This gave the movies a sense of freedom and adventure which is of course the very ideals which America was founded upon. They were in the most part pursuit and  or escape movies. The antiheroes featured were usually on the run from something be it the law or an unhappy lifestyle.Slightly late to the dance was American Perfekt 1997 which features upon reflection some fascinating casting choices. Robert Forster Fairuza Balk David Thewlis Amanda Plummer and Paul Sorvino all play their parts magnificently in this almost forgotten slice of oddball Americana.Plummer plays Sandra Thomas a woman who clearly hasn't managed to get her life completely together and who is driving across the desert to meet her sister Alice Balk who has absolutely no interest in getting hers together at all. After a near fatal crash Sandra meets Jake Nyman Forster who helps her out as her car is practically totalled.After the setup we are thrust into a world of seedy motels and small town cops of bar skanks and confidence tricksters Thewlis is particularly slimy repuslsive and wonderful in this however nothing will ever frighten me as much as his performance in 'Naked'. No one seems particularly trustworthy and this creates a Twin peaks feel to the movie in that it keeps you constantly guessing as to what the motives and true back stories of the characters. It was written and directed by Paul Chart an artist who has done little else since but if this is anything to go by another offering would be graciously received.The film spirals into a tense dusty thriller which has both a charm and a quality that whilst being very much 'of the time' hold up exceptionally well fifteen years later. If you haven't yet had the pleasure of American Perfekt and enjoyed the aforementioned road movies then this would be a great investment of a few hours.Read more at zombiehamster.com".

	schema:reviewBody "American Perfekt is a disjointed yet darkly compelling little nightmare of a road movie a dusty ode to bowers of the American southwest left unchecked and decayed populated by wayward souls with perpetual heat delirium vixens psychopaths and hustlers alike who saunter through lurid story lines that often end in bloodshed and madness. In the vein of stuff like Oliver Stone's UTurn and Kalifornia we once again pair up with some extremely off colour characters as they navigate both the tangled web of highways that lace the States as well as the human capacity for greed lust and heinous physical violence. The characters and actors for that matter who populate this stretch of highway are an especially bizarre bunch starting with Robert Forster's vacationing criminal psychologist Jake Nyman. Forster is quite the unpredictable guy usually found in calmly benign protagonist roles yet just as capable of stirring the pot with evil antics. Here's he's opaqueness incarnate driving from one place to another until he runs into two sisters played by another couple of acting hellcats Amanda Plummer and Fairuza Balk. Jake is basing each decision of his trip upon the flip of a coin al Harvey Dent a tactic which simultaneously causes trouble and indicates how unhinged he might really be.Plummer is weird and Balk is weirder but neither as weird as David 'Professor Lupin' Thewlis as an awkwardly placed character who seems to exist just to jump into a scene and throw the mood off kilter. There's others running amok too including Geoffrey Lewis as well as Paul Sorvino and Chris Sarandon as a pair of state troopers who serve as comic relief. Forster is scary here playing a guy who is psychologically hard to pin down or get a read on and he's got some dynamite scenes with Balk in the third act the two talents lighting up the frame. It's pretty far south of coherent though mostly just these freaks terrorizing each other and engaging in puzzling romantic flings that only make sense to them I suppose. If feverish borderline abstract sunstroked neo noir is your thing go for it. You can certainly do worse than spend a certifiably bonkers ninety minutes with this terrific bunch of actors.".

	schema:headline " Ripe for rerelease!";
	schema:reviewBody "A 'classic' film whatever that may be can almost never be remade in quite the same way again.  It's something that we've thought about for quite a while though  and noted filmmakers including Gus Van Sant and Sydney Pollack have tried and failed to remake films to jazz up their appeal and make them more accessible to a wider audience.  It's something that passed through my mind quite a few times as I watched The Children's Hour today. Quite clearly this is a film that more people deserve to see and know about and it would certainly be interesting to try and remake it but we would definitely lose something in the translation.The largest reason for this is because it is a film of a definite period  the issues raised in the film are widely discussed these days whereas in the period the film was set homosexuality was something to be feared and despised.  Similarly we do not have the various elaborate codes of honour that are so prevalent in the film and dictate the actions of almost all characters.  It's a pity then that this film will be alien to lots of people today.  The answer however is not in a remake the film is itself a remake of a 1936 film by the same director called These Three and an adaptation of a play of the same name by Lillian Hellman but a rerelease of this fine example of moviemaking.Boasting a terrific cast including Audrey Hepburn Shirley MacLaine and James Garner The Children's Hour is the story of two teachers Miss Dobie and Miss Wright who found a school for young girls in an idyllic town in America.  Then out of boredom spite and plain maliciousness a child tells a vicious lie that will bring about the downfall of the school the teachers and all caught up in the horrible set of affairs.  It is quite possible to see the creeping evil and hatred that stems from Mary the child concerned played wonderfully by Karen Balkin.  Eventually it reaches out and destroys all it touches.The photography is great it was nominated for an Oscar  there are many scenes which are so wonderfully composed that each frame paints a thousand words the climax of the movie is a great example.  The relationship between MacLaine and Hepburn is delicately and sensitively portrayed especially for a cast who didn't know what they were doing according to MacLaine in an interview for The Celluloid Closet.

	onyx:emotionText "A 'classic' film whatever that may be can almost never be remade in quite the same way again.  It's something that we've thought about for quite a while though  and noted filmmakers including Gus Van Sant and Sydney Pollack have tried and failed to remake films to jazz up their appeal and make them more accessible to a wider audience.  It's something that passed through my mind quite a few times as I watched The Children's Hour today. Quite clearly this is a film that more people deserve to see and know about and it would certainly be interesting to try and remake it but we would definitely lose something in the translation.The largest reason for this is because it is a film of a definite period  the issues raised in the film are widely discussed these days whereas in the period the film was set homosexuality was something to be feared and despised.  Similarly we do not have the various elaborate codes of honour that are so prevalent in the film and dictate the actions of almost all characters.  It's a pity then that this film will be alien to lots of people today.  The answer however is not in a remake the film is itself a remake of a 1936 film by the same director called These Three and an adaptation of a play of the same name by Lillian Hellman but a rerelease of this fine example of moviemaking.Boasting a terrific cast including Audrey Hepburn Shirley MacLaine and James Garner The Children's Hour is the story of two teachers Miss Dobie and Miss Wright who found a school for young girls in an idyllic town in America.  Then out of boredom spite and plain maliciousness a child tells a vicious lie that will bring about the downfall of the school the teachers and all caught up in the horrible set of affairs.  It is quite possible to see the creeping evil and hatred that stems from Mary the child concerned played wonderfully by Karen Balkin.  Eventually it reaches out and destroys all it touches.The photography is great it was nominated for an Oscar  there are many scenes which are so wonderfully composed that each frame paints a thousand words the climax of the movie is a great example.  The relationship between MacLaine and Hepburn is delicately and sensitively portrayed especially for a cast who didn't know what they were doing according to MacLaine in an interview for The Celluloid Closet.  James Garner is also good in his role as the doctor about to marry Hepburn although the movie is clearly not aimed at giving him the best lines.  There are also many many superb supporting roles  and the film's strength comes from a great ensemble performance.It doesn't really matter what the child accuses the teachers of indeed we only find out a good hour into the film although it has been strongly implied because the film isn't really about homosexuality.  As MacLaine points out in The Celluloid Closet a cracking documentary about the history of homosexuality in the movies it is about a child's accusation.

	schema:reviewBody "The Children's Hour More than just an ounce of truth... SPOILERS THE CHILDREN'S HOUR has gotten a rather bad rap over the years. It has gained this reputation that it is somehow a noble effort but nonetheless a failure. That because of its subject matter and the era in which it was made the need to gingerly handle the subject of lesbianism makes the end result seem dishonestly incomplete at best or just cowardly at worst. The fact that it is a tragedy which ends in the death of a gay character underscores this need by some to devalue its importance and deride its power because it doesn't meet the harsher standards of political correctness.It is probable that if the film or more accurately Lillian Hellman's original play were to be filmed today much of it would be altered. Even if a new version were set in the 1960s of the movie or the 1930s of the original play the filmmakers would face considerable pressure to make the gay characters more defiant the homophobic characters more transparently belligerent and the presumed nature of the lesbian relationship more explicit. And that would be the wrong thing to do. Even though the film was made on the eve of an era that saw censorship beginning to crumble it depicts a time when homosexuality was barely mentioned let alone something to inspire defiant pride. It has been suggested by Hellman director William Wyler and star Shirley MacLaine that the gay angle of the story is really secondary to the story's main concern that being the power of lies to destroy. I think this is more than a little disingenuous a way of sidestepping the issue. Homophobia is the point of the story whether the lie in the story is really a lie or not. That's why the 1936 film version THESE THREE also directed by Wyler doesn't work despite being well made and well acted. THE CHILDREN'S HOUR rings true despite its evasive nature. Both films deal with two women who run a small exclusive girls school whose lives and careers are destroyed by stories told by a couple of their pupils. In THESE THREE the story is sanitized so that it deals with accusations that one of the teachers has had an affair with the other's fianc THE CHILDREN'S HOUR returns to the play's original plot wherein the two teachers are accused of lesbianism. THESE THREE though melodramatically played has little dramatic weight unsubstantiated accusations of an affair that everybody denies ever happened might raise eyebrows but hardly would carry such dire consequences especially since the two children making the claims are shown to be so unstable and unreliable. And the film's desperate attempt at a happy ending doesn't help. Homosexuality has to be the linchpin of THE CHILDREN'S HOUR because little else would create such irrational fear. The lie of the story would have to be so very threatening in 1961 otherwise it would not be credible that parents would overreact so fiercely or that the words of three upstanding citizens would be rejected over the claims of two foolish little girls. I think the film paints a fair and accurate picture of a time when homophobia wasn't considered a bigotry but a logically parental concern. As such the film is neither progay nor antigay rather a consideration of a time of ignorance. Faye Bainter's Mrs. Tilford is what we would now call homophobic but she is not an evil person. She is foolish to the extent that she can't see how manipulative and dishonest her grandchild is but her actions against the school and its teachers are based on the prevailing social outlook of the time. She acts out of genuine concern not hysterical outrage. Indeed her view of homosexuality is not all that different from that of MacLaine's Martha Dobie one of the accused teachers. It is Martha's suicide upon admitting her true romantic feelings toward Audrey Hepburn's Karen Wright that disturbs many who criticize the film. Martha is no more comfortable with homosexuality than Mrs. Tilford but her fear of homosexuality is intensified and internalized. But Martha's death is not mandated to appease the moral atmosphere of the time as some have suggested nor because of her own selfhatred but because that is the unfortunate logical path the story has to take. In a tormented confession Martha reveals the contempt and shame she has for her feelings but this is not meant to represent the honesty of homophobia but rather the dishonesty of traditionally accepted mores. Pride and defiance are not options to Martha she has neither the understanding nor the strength to endure the battle between her feelings and the moral convictions that society has taught her. As a tragic figure she is more than an appropriate symbol of her time. As a character she is beautifully and sympathetically embodied by MacLaine in one of her finest performances.The film's message is not that homosexuality destroys Martha but that ignorance poisons the waters. Martha's death is undeserved but not a punishment of her lesbianism. Martha is a good person a person who has our sympathy not our pity. The injustice of her death confirms the film's empathy for the homosexual character. Unlike the faux happilyeverafter conclusion of THESE THREE THE CHILDREN'S HOUR forces the viewer to question conventional morality. The film ends on a strangely ambiguous note. Martha confesses her feelings to Karen but Karen evolves into an enigma. Even before Martha reveals her true feelings Karen finally rejects her fianc played by James Garner by forcing him to express the doubts about their relationship that she herself has apparently being harboring all along. But she accepts Martha's confession of love yet makes no attempt to reciprocate. The film hints but won't confirm that the lie with the ounce of truth is as true about Karen as it was about Martha. Karen seems to have gone from denying her feelings toward Martha to accepting them and then repressing them. The film ends with Karen leaving Martha's funeral apparently strongwilled and defiant but it is not clear just why. It's not likely that Karen feels vindication over Mrs. Tilford's apology yet it is equally unlikely that Martha's death could possibly have inspired feelings of pride and defiance. The final shots of Hepburn possess an undeniable power perhaps foreshadowing the changes in the way society would eventually view homosexuality. Martha's martyrdom makes Karen a stronger person whatever her sexual inclination. It's not a happilyeverafter ending but it is a promise of better endings to come.".

The lie ends in a tragedy. The Children's Hour is a cruel and heartbreaking story that shows how destructive power of a lie may be. William Wyler is among my favorite directors and this film is a little gem with a magnificent screenplay. Shirley MacLaine has awesome performance in the role of a woman that does not accept her homo sexual preference and the girl Karen Balkin is amazing in the role of one of the meanest characters I have ever seen.

So you see the premise of The Children's Hour is not at all outofdate!What is absolutely fascinating about this film and what makes it unique in all the dramas which have been made on the subject of homosexuality is the treatment of the road of selfdiscovery taken by these two very different women.MacLaine wants Hepburn to buy some new clothes in an early scene because she remembers how stylish her friend liked to be in her university days and she even shares the memory of her first sight of Hepburn when she said to herself What a pretty girl! By the time the action of this movie begins these two women have already lived and worked together for at least ten years. There was university together. Then they both started teaching and accumulated several years' worth of experience and it must certainly have taken a while to save up the money to set up the private girls' school of their dreams. That is a long relationship a very committed relationship. Many similar career women in the 1960's back to the 1870's !  famous women novelists scientists musicians artists poets  are now casually described in academia as lesbians if they had any kind of a lengthy partnership with another woman at all. It has become a fashionable politically correct label. But are these labels accurate?Years ago a sisterly friendship was accepted as just that. Now some kind of sex act is required and assumed. Nobody is supposed to be able to exist without regular orgasms. Nonsense! The culture has turned us all into Pavlovian dogs who salivate on cue. It is not true that 'everybody is doing it.' It wasn't true in past generations and it isn't even true today.The women in The Children's Hour were not 'doing it' either. But the movie is thrilling because it is not concerned with the spasms of body parts but with the deep things of the heart.MacLaine adored Hepburn and always had. Hepburn was surely conscious at some level all those years of that adoration. Every lasting friendship between two people has unspoken dynamics reasons why the individuals relate strongly to one another key roles they play in each others' life story sex may or may not be involved at all.But in this case we can be sure that sex was involved at a repressed level to start with. MacLaine came to realize that even touching Hepburn's hand was a pleasure which formerly she had chosen not to analyze too closely.Mary the awful precocious schoolchild whom we have seen reading some 'dirty book' in bed at night with a flashlight evidently got her hands on something very graphic indeed and this is what horrified the grandmother when she whispered what she couldn't say aloud in the back of the rich old lady's limousine. There was more to this account than merely a story of 'kissing'.As MacLaine says in her own great scene somehow that monstrous little girl had sensed by intuition 'a grain of truth' to wrap her lie around. That 'grain of truth' becomes a snowball by the end of the movie. MacLaine has confessed her love for Hepburn. Without histrionics but with quiet honesty Hepburn has confessed the same to her friend I love you too. And Hepburn even faced with total vindication and financial security from the libel award never once considers contacting James Garner and putting their marriage plans back on track. Why not? The answer is that she herself has slowly come to a realization of her own need to make a life with MacLaine. She goes for her walk ready for the future ahead.But it is MacLaine looking lovingly out the window at Hepburn almost blissfully secure for the first time that she is loved and valued by the person she cares about the most who still knows that the future ahead for the two of them will entail a higher price for her than she is willing to pay. She cannot face the inevitable physical expression of her love for Hepburn. She is also burdened by a dysfunctional family background with her only relative being the crazed delusional aunt who has sponged off of her and then let her down when she ignored those telegrams pleading for her to come back to testify for the two of them.MacLaine and Hepburn do know as they reveal in one of their final conversations that there are lesbians someplace out there somewhere who do accept themselves and who do somehow make lives for themselves. But MacLaine says We are not like that.Hepburn has the strength to try. MacLaine isn't strong enough.This is what Hepburn senses as she walks back towards the house as she has been thinking things over on her walk. The aunt's calling out looking for MacLaine makes her really alarmed. But by the time she breaks down MacLaine's door it is too late.Hepburn's second walk after the funeral so purposefully reminiscent of the previous walk is the quick step of a soldier marching to battle. She is not afraid. And she is free to make any choice she wants. The stick figures of the townspeople standing at the edge of the graveyard can never touch her again.".

Every lasting friendship between two people has unspoken dynamics reasons why the individuals relate strongly to one another key roles they play in each others' life story sex may or may not be involved at all.But in this case we can be sure that sex was involved at a repressed level to start with. MacLaine came to realize that even touching Hepburn's hand was a pleasure which formerly she had chosen not to analyze too closely.Mary the awful precocious schoolchild whom we have seen reading some 'dirty book' in bed at night with a flashlight evidently got her hands on something very graphic indeed and this is what horrified the grandmother when she whispered what she couldn't say aloud in the back of the rich old lady's limousine. There was more to this account than merely a story of 'kissing'.As MacLaine says in her own great scene somehow that monstrous little girl had sensed by intuition 'a grain of truth' to wrap her lie around. That 'grain of truth' becomes a snowball by the end of the movie. MacLaine has confessed her love for Hepburn. Without histrionics but with quiet honesty Hepburn has confessed the same to her friend I love you too. And Hepburn even faced with total vindication and financial security from the libel award never once considers contacting James Garner and putting their marriage plans back on track. Why not? The answer is that she herself has slowly come to a realization of her own need to make a life with MacLaine. She goes for her walk ready for the future ahead.But it is MacLaine looking lovingly out the window at Hepburn almost blissfully secure for the first time that she is loved and valued by the person she cares about the most who still knows that the future ahead for the two of them will entail a higher price for her than she is willing to pay. She cannot face the inevitable physical expression of her love for Hepburn. She is also burdened by a dysfunctional family background with her only relative being the crazed delusional aunt who has sponged off of her and then let her down when she ignored those telegrams pleading for her to come back to testify for the two of them.MacLaine and Hepburn do know as they reveal in one of their final conversations that there are lesbians someplace out there somewhere who do accept themselves and who do somehow make lives for themselves. But MacLaine says We are not like that.Hepburn has the strength to try. MacLaine isn't strong enough.This is what Hepburn senses as she walks back towards the house as she has been thinking things over on her walk. The aunt's calling out looking for MacLaine makes her really alarmed. But by the time she breaks down MacLaine's door it is too late.Hepburn's second walk after the funeral so purposefully reminiscent of the previous walk is the quick step of a soldier marching to battle. She is not afraid. And she is free to make any choice she wants. The stick figures of the townspeople standing at the edge of the graveyard can never touch her again.";

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched The Children's Hour for the first time this evening.  I must say that I was very impressed.  Hepburn and MacLaine gave brilliant performances as the two headmistresses of a girl's school.  The cinema photography was outstanding and the direction and writing were fantastic.Turner Classic Movies ran this gorgeous film this evening and the comments that were made after the run brought several thoughts to mind.  After viewing the movie I decided to get online and see what others had to say about this film.The one comment that was made tonight was that it was thought that the film didn't really appeal' to the heightened sensibility of the audiences of the 60's.  However I felt that the movie was timeless in its observations and portrayals of its two main characters.  Grant it homosexuality was NOT the main focus of this movie but it does play a very important albeit small role.In today's society homosexuality is more widely accepted than it was at the time this play was written.  However there is one area in society that it is still 'taboo' to be gay and that is in the teaching profession.  There are STILL more than 40 years after this movie was made teachers that cannot be who they really are for fear of losing their jobs the respect of their peers and the trust of parents.  Grant it this is not in every part of the country in every town but it is still as thus in smalltown America. I know this for fact as I am the lifepartner of a teacher.  I know what it is like for him to have to hide who he really is and the torture that he goes through because of it.  Children can say some very vicious things and I have seen what it can do to a person firsthand.  This is why I feel that this picture is very 'true to life' because in so many ways this is still the way things are today.Indeed more people should see this movie!  Maybe people would think before spreading rumors.  This is a prime example of what one comment can do to a person's life and how it can snowball.".

He had directed the film years before but the tone had been changed during the first version of The Children's Hour. In fact there is no gayness to speak of in the previous adaptation These Three.Even for 1961 when the film was released lesbianism was not treated or seen in the same fashion one encounters it everywhere today. In fact the dialogue of the film doesn't include the word lesbian at all! Lillian Hellman was a woman committed to show the ills in society she lived in. Hypocrisy is dealt with in most of her work. In this film she emphasizes the fatal consequences of how a lie can destroy lives as it's the case here. Because of a brat's hatred for authority and discipline Karen's and Martha's reputation suffer greatly because the adults are so bent into condemning them without much of an investigation to see if the accuser is lying or not.Martha at the end reveals her feelings for Karen which we suspected all along. There were no indications or tell tell signs between these two young women of any kind to substantiate the charges. In fact Karen is extremely hurt by just being accused of being a lesbian when she for all appearances is in love with young and handsome Dr. Cardin.When the truth is realized we see how things change but it's too late for Martha who has taken things in her own hands. At the last scene we watch most of the people that have been instrumental in accusing Karen and Martha at the cemetery as they all feel guilty of what they have done to ruin these women.William Wyler got good acting in general of his small cast. Shirley MacLaine and Audrey Hepburn make good contributions as Martha and Karen. Miriam Hopkins is the selfcentered aunt Lily. Fay Banter is Amerlia Tilford the woman who is instrumental in ruining the women. James Garner is good as Dr. Cardin and Karen Belkin makes an impression with her evil Mary Tilford.The film seems today as somehow dated. Mr. Wyler finally was able to do justice to Ms. Hellman's play.".

	schema:headline " Dated but intriguing film";
	schema:reviewBody "As with several projects involving Lillian Helman the backstory is nearly as interesting as the written work. In this case her trailblazing play The Children's Hour was morphed into a film called These Three. Because lesbianism was one aspect of the plot the story had to be sanitized to meet the Hays Code in place at the time. The changes imposed on it actually resulted in a striking and memorable film. Years later the same director Wyler attempted to tackle the original story in it's unaltered form but ironically it was unable to match the level of the first movie. Here single closely knit teachers Hepburn and MacLaine are just realizing their dream of running their own girls school when a bitter vengeful child creates a snowballing vicious rumor about them out of spite. Influential and wellmeaning Bainter the grandmother of the child takes the rumor to heart and soon the school is in jeopardy Hepburn faces losing her handsome doctor fiance Garner and MacLaine is forced to face some painful truths about herself. The film is attractively shot and wellappointed in its details. Hepburn is lovely and does a fine job. MacLaine gets a meaty part with several strong moments. Garner shows surprising vulnerability along with his customary charm. Hopkins a lead in These Three hams it up enjoyably as MacLaine's melodramatic aunt. Bainter lends her typically strong presence and was Oscar nominated even if she occasionally looks like Herbert Marshall in drag. Balkin as the deplorable child is appropriately spoiled and malicious though it's hard to understand how the adults can't see through her machinations. One of her victims is Cartwright who would later appear in The Birds and Alien. Though the subject matter was still taboo even in 1961 enough of the elements come through in the film to get the points across. Unfortunately the treatment of the subject is rather unenlightened and at times awkward. However due to the timid approach to the material creative use was made of visuals and unheard dialogue in order to avoid explicitly stating many of the details. Situated benignly into the dialogue whether intentional or not one can't tell are phrases like in the closet and sissy. Alex North ingeniously interpolated the childhood song Skip to My Loo into his score whenever Balkin is around. The song's lyrics detail spoilers like fly's in the buttermilk and cat's in the cream jar which are certainly in line with the type of ruination she causes everyone. She must have been a little TOO annoying as she scarcely worked again after this. When all is said and done the film is a wellheeled curiosity falling short of greatness but offering a great early glimpse of attitudes toward homosexuality on the big screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "The big screen finally got to see The Children's Hour as Lillian Hellman meant for it to be seen a searing drama on the power of self hate of one's sexuality.This PreStonewall gay drama is about two teachers who run a select school for wealthy young adolescent girls. One of them Audrey Hepburn has been engaged for a couple of years to Doctor James Garner but she never quite gets around to getting married. The business of running the school with her friend and business partner Shirley MacLaine consumes all the time for both of them.A really bad seed of a kid Karen Balkin gets disciplined once to often as she sees it by Hepburn. The young girl concocts a story about seeing the two of them in a sex act and tells her guardian and grandmother Fay Bainter. Bainter does her own 'investigation' and confirms it in her eyes. The word spreads and the kids are withdrawn from the school rather than be tainted by being around those horrific lesbians.The Code was coming down. Though the word lesbian is never used in the film that's what it's all about. Back in the day Samuel Goldwyn took this story and made it a straight triangle story with Merle Oberon Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrea. Back in the day the Code said that homosexuality could not even be discussed let alone dramatized. Now we're seeing what was a landmark drama about gay people Lillian Hellman's vision as it really was. Just denying it isn't enough because there's a grain of truth to it. Repressed sexuality is a terrible thing and it's taking a strain on both of them. Shirley MacLaine finally cracks under it and admits that she's been crushing out on Hepburn ever since they first met in college. Remember that she lived in a society in the Thirties when The Children's Hour was first written where being gay was in some eyes worse than being an ax murderer. Finally coming out with it in the end was too much for her and it brings on terrible consequences for MacLaine.Back in the day when I was a working investigator for New York State Crime Victims Board I recall a case where a man killed someone and wounded two other people. The Assistant District Attorney told me after the case was over that it was because the perpetrator was involved sexually with the deceased and the deceased was not in the closet whereas our perpetrator was. The victim wanted to tell the world about what he thought was the new love of his life. The perpetrator flipped out at the mention of it and killed him and wounded two friends. Self hate internalized homophobia can be an awfully evil thing. Hellman could easily have written her play that way as well.Audrey Hepburn also though she doesn't articulate it wonders why is it she's stayed shut away in that school and doesn't commit to finally take the plunge and marry Garner. The Children's Hour is more than a play about the love that dare not speak its name you can't even think it in the world of that time. MacLaine and Hepburn give two of their best performances of their respective careers. Miriam Hopkins who was in These Three plays MacLaine's aunt who's a silly creature and who betrays the two women rather than be thought she condones the alleged lesbianism. Fay Bainter gave her final big screen performance here and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.William Wyler who directed These Three back in the day finally got to do the version as Hellman wrote it. He does as well for Hellman here as he did in The Little Foxes. He gets some of the best work out of all the players involved even James Garner who's playing a distinct third fiddle here in a woman's picture in every sense of the word.The Children's Hour came to the screen in 1961. Brokeback Mountain which in many ways has the same themes as The Children's Hour for gay men was set originally in 1963. Both are great examples of the strides gay people have made in their quest for a place in the sunlight.Yet that case I described from my working years took place in the early Nineties. The closet might be thought of as a refuge but it's a terrible prison for too many.".

	schema:reviewBody "William Wyler's atmospheric drama has two teachers Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine be accused of lesbianism by a guileful schoolgirl and then have that rumour ruin their job their lives and their friendship.Somewhat of a taboo for the 60s Wyler bravely tackles the subject with honesty and integrity and his cast work well to bring the tense atmosphere to us. As the engaged straight Miss Wright Audrey Hepburn suffers commendably fighting always for the truth  as she sees it and as a result losing her fiance. Shirley MacLaine is the more ambiguous character of the two. It is not on whether the allegations were true it is clear from the off that they are just slander of the worst kind from a bored vindictive little girl that the mystery of the film lies but in whether her character does secretly love Hepburns' as more than a friend.The children are less apt in their roles. None of them have names worth remembering but the main one who spreads the rumours does it with such exaggerated facial expressions that it is difficult at times of most intense drama not to laugh and the other girl who aids her in the spreading of lies is also laughable in her fear.

	onyx:emotionText "William Wyler's atmospheric drama has two teachers Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine be accused of lesbianism by a guileful schoolgirl and then have that rumour ruin their job their lives and their friendship.Somewhat of a taboo for the 60s Wyler bravely tackles the subject with honesty and integrity and his cast work well to bring the tense atmosphere to us. As the engaged straight Miss Wright Audrey Hepburn suffers commendably fighting always for the truth  as she sees it and as a result losing her fiance. Shirley MacLaine is the more ambiguous character of the two. It is not on whether the allegations were true it is clear from the off that they are just slander of the worst kind from a bored vindictive little girl that the mystery of the film lies but in whether her character does secretly love Hepburns' as more than a friend.The children are less apt in their roles. None of them have names worth remembering but the main one who spreads the rumours does it with such exaggerated facial expressions that it is difficult at times of most intense drama not to laugh and the other girl who aids her in the spreading of lies is also laughable in her fear.

Karen is engaged to Dr. Joe Cardin James Garner but has refused to set a wedding date until the school is actually successful. Dr. Cardin has a young cousin once removed Mary Tilford Karen Balkin attending said school. Unfortunately Mary is a compulsive liar with a spiteful nature. Mary proceeds to tell lies made up of fact and fiction to her loving grandmother Mrs. Amelia Tilford Fay Bainter in the hopes of not having to return to the school where she is continually disciplined for her obvious lies obvious to everyone but her grandmother. Mrs. Tilford who is Joe's aunt believing her granddaughter does the one thing she thinks to be morally right and that is to unknowingly spread these lies to other parents. Parents pull their kids from the school and Karen Martha and Joe are left to defend themselves unsuccessfully against the lies of a little girl. The truth is finally revealed but with the damage already done only tragedy is left as the victor.Recommendations Sensitively directed by William Wyler this film was and is groundbreaking. Technically speaking it has authentic black and white art direction perfect cinematography believably authentic costumes and excellent work done by the sound engineers. Still it is the acting by the glorious Audrey Hepburn the brilliant Shirley MacLaine the sensitive James Garner and the annoyingly real Miriam Hopkins who plays Martha's aunt and employee who bring this movie to life. Having said all that it is the supporting work of Fay Bainter that completes this film with her heartbreaking grace and aching search for moral fortitude she becomes the conscious of this film and the conscious of the times. She is brilliant. In closing I know that the ending of this film has troubled many an opened minded individual who thinks that the decision taken by one of the two heroines is a painful and a seemingly easy cop out but I say to those people that if you watch this film carefully you will realize that her decision is not the only option given it is just the option that she regrettably chooses. This film viewed with an open mind even with its heartbreaking ending did and does more for equality than is apparent to the eye. Brilliant.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this time weeks after California became the second state to recognize gay and lesbian marriages I thought I'd finally get a look at a time when anyone even accused of loving someone of the same gender got himher ostracized by watching The Children's Hour a movie made in 1961 based on a play written by native New Orleanean Lilian Hellman in the 1930s. In this one bratty girl Mary Karen Balkin lies to her grandmother Fay Bainter about a relationship between her teachers Karen Wright Audrey Hepburn and Martha Dobie Shirley MacLaine. Another girl Rosalie Veronica Cartwright gets roped to play along because she borrows some jewelry and doesn't want to get ratted out. A Dr. Joe Cardin James Garner defends fiance Karen and Martha's honor in front of the rich grandmother but is unable to stop all the girl students from being sent elsewhere. And it doesn't help when Martha's actress aunt Lily Miriam Hopkins is conveniently away during most of the trial that results from a suit against the grandmother that she wins. This was a well done movie about how some lies can snowball to tragic consequences and how some truths can be found in those lies. Director William Wyler who had previously filmed this as These Three but had to change some of the material to suit the Production Code of the time brings his usual classy treatment to such sensitive material. Leads Hepburn and MacLaine especially MacLaine bring emotional power in their roles that challenge them to the fullest. Mr. Garner acquits himself nicely in his scenes with them. Hopkins and Bainterwith Ms. Hopkins a veteran of These Threealso provide fine support. As for the children while Ms. Balkin does indeed seem too annoying as Mary to be convincingly charming even to her grandma Ms. Cartwright is just the right side of frightful in her reluctance as Rosalie to cross Mary to her face. Of course I think Grandma is so prejudiced that thinking what her granddaughter whispered was outandout lies was the last thing on her mind. And the difference between attitudes then and now is heartbreakingly brought out at the end when Martha reveals her true feelings to Karen before Karen takes a walk and then the aftermath when she runs back in... While homosexuality may be more open and accepted today there's still some backlash that makes this movie even more relevant now. And seeing Garner backtoback in this and Sayonara just now makes me appreciate how brave he was in appearing in these thenprovocative films. So on that note I highly recommend The Children's Hour. P.S. My condolences to Hepburn's and Mel Ferrer's son Sean on the recent death of his father at the age of 90.".

James Garner is so genuinely loving and likable as usual! The other characters are also fabulous but for length I won't list them all! I highly recommend this film to someone who appreciates dramatic film with good character development. It is definitely not what I expected from something on an Audrey Hepburn list which makes me love her more! Some raters feel that this movie has homophobic undertones and is not appropriate for today's society because we are so open minded now???. As someone who has worked with youth of today in a small town I believe it is still relatable. I think it would open up a good discussion because I felt hope in the midst of tragedy I don't want to give away anything but basically a what could you have done instead dialog.I weeped at the end but would watch it again as it is superb. I would give it a 10 but having only seen it once I feel biased as I'm sure there are minor flaws somewhere! I give it a 9.910 instead!".

I think it would open up a good discussion because I felt hope in the midst of tragedy I don't want to give away anything but basically a what could you have done instead dialog.I weeped at the end but would watch it again as it is superb. I would give it a 10 but having only seen it once I feel biased as I'm sure there are minor flaws somewhere! I give it a 9.910 instead!";

The lies spiral out of control and soon enough the school is out of business and the women find their lives ruined before it is finally realized that the student was lying all along much to the horror of the adults who were all too ready to believe her.This movie is a strong reflection of the time it was made in.

The story doesn't set out to lecture but rather shows how easy it is for one lie to lead to another and how idle gossip can become much more venomous if given the chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a stage play by Lillian Hellman The Children's Hour is a story about taboo the implications of lies and the naive and selfish mentality of children. Being based on a play the film is as melodramatic as you'd expect but as the cast is made up of such a talented bunch of actors the melodrama never gets in the way of the plot or point of the film. The Children's Hour stars two of it's days biggest female stars Audrey Hepburn and Shirley Maclaine who play teachers and owners of a private girls boarding school. Their lives fall into disarray when a spiteful student accuses the two women of having a lesbian relationship. Nowadays we've moved on a bit so the women of this film's problem wouldn't be all that great today but when put into the context of the film's setting and the moods at the time it gives the film a very potent social commentary. The film balances this with a character study of it's main characters and together these two elements blend into one very good film indeed. Add a brilliant script and some fine acting performances into the mix and you've got a film that's damn near perfect.Despite the fact that it stars two of the biggest stars of it's day in Audrey Hepburn and Shirley Maclaine the standout performance of the film for me comes from the young Karen Balkin in the role of the troublesome child at the centre of the scandal. Balkin steals every scene she's in even when on screen with the two leads and despite the fact that her character is repulsive I always found myself waiting for her to come back on screen. It's a shame she only made one other film after this one. The film is really well written and we delve into the character's nightmare we get to learn more about them as people as well as learning about the social implications of the scandal. The film balances these two elements perfectly and this always ensures that the film has enough intrigue to keep the audience's interest. The central point of the implications of lies is very potent at all times and this was the most interesting aspect of the movie to me. How so many people can form their opinions of someone on the words of a child is made more frightening by the fact that this sort of thing could and most probably has actually happened. On the whole like most of Audrey Hepburn's work in the sixties  this is an excellent film and comes with high recommendations!".

I've read some comments.... this is not at all dated if one knows the perils gay people have to teach.... and remember this was also a boarding school..... with the society moving toward antigay bashing again.... the reaction of a potential gay teacher at a school WOULD indeed raise eyebrows. For some reason society looks on gays as the sicko perverts that kill these poor little ones that are kidnapped out here  oddly look at some recently...there are pedophiles... but not gay. Anyway the film is acted incredibly well. Shirley MacLaine gives a tourdeforce dramatic acting job in the film. I've rarely ever seen anything Hepburn was in that isn't interesting and leaves one with a curious scratching of the head to figure out the individual at the end ... her scene walking away at the end sparks a curiosity...might she have repressed a love beyond girlhood friendship for MacLaine in the film. Fay Bainter to me though produces one of the best supporting roles in a movie to date. She was totally believable as the homophobic rich grandmother.... not unlike so many in society today ...... unless you are gay people... you have no idea of the Society disapproval and she is so right on. Miriam Hopkins captures the aunt in a far more tawdry sleazy way than the original actress in the 30s version. Unfortunately if this movie is ever made again.... in my age it will still be sanitized for Hollywood and ironically the 1961 version will probably be the truest to the original story. Garner is very innocent in his role as the love interest and very believable. The little grandchild reminds me of the girl  in the Bad Seed...... if the 2 of them matched wits ... they'd be on Wide World of Wrestling  Evil Children's star edition. This movie is excellent cinema an actors' movie. A true classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Audrey Hepburn stars in William Wyler's film based on Lillian Hellman's play The Children's Hour. It's a story about a girls' school and its two teachers Karen Wright Audrey Hepburn and Martha Dobie Shirley MacLaine. Things seem to be going well in their school until a trouble maker Mary Karen Balkin makes up a rumor about the teachers' relationship based on her thoughts and what she has heard. Everybody in the town start to believe in the story Mary has made up leading Karen and Martha to despair.If you didn't guess already this is a survey of homosexuality. In the movie they don't dare to say the word out loud. But we see discussions behind doors and windows we see the gestures of the characters. We follow the events as outsiders. To which the almost expressionistic blackandwhite cinematography gives a great touch. The strong grip of nature relying on the experience of an individual and simplified milieus fit for the story better than well.The rumor did much more harm than Mary could have guessed. It destroyed the relationship between Karen and her husband tobe Joe Cardin James Garner. It destroyed everything they had worked hard for. But it also made Martha think about her real feelings about her good friend. The film is open for interpretation and it is not made clear whether the rumor was true or not in the first place. Or did the rumor just make Martha realize something did it change her or did her mind change her because of the rumor. Wyler makes it clear that actually it doesn't matter whether the rumor is true or not. All the people are so shocked of this horrible sin that they blindly follow a child's story and drive two women into despair.Even that The Children's Hour approaches the case of being a lesbian carefully I found this movie very brave. The censorship of Hollywood had loosened but still they had trouble bringing this up on the screen. I'm amazed with the result and I'm sure this touched many people in the 60's and made a lot of people broaden their horizons  and it still can. Many people even today are shocked to here about homosexuality. There still are many people who just can't accept it and that's what makes this movie timeless.The acting is superb  one of Hepburn's greatest performances but I liked the acting of Shirley MacLaine as well. Many people might know the director William Wyler as the director of Benhur he's one of the greatest American filmmakers. This was another proof of his talents The Children's Hour was very capturing the characters were sympathetic  easy to relate to  and well built. It's no masterpiece but it is an incredibly capturing melodrama. Slightly expressionistic imagery and Wyler's calm mature approach subject make this a remarkable film.The film's built on strong emotional scale. People scream yell cry and moan. It portrays pure grand emotions and the topic's pretty harsh. But the director has placed a satirical twist to the film. Showing the people whispering talking quietly about it but never saying it out loud. They're so afraid of it that they can't even say the word. Perhaps all the people are so insecure and vulnerable that they try to dodge the whole subject. Not even trying to search for themselves. It's never too late to find your identity and stop pretending. If looking at the film from this angle it breaks out from being just a provocative film about an unmentioned taboo. It's reaches an universal level studying the true identity of man.".

Sociodrama is a genre in film not only made in Belgium. Many great directors have made solid sociodrama's Aki Kaurismaki Ken Loach Mike Leigh and many others.Where you can find a twist of humor in Kaurismaki's movies you'll have a hard time finding it in L'Enfant. A high level of realism avoids any dramatization of the struggleforlife the protagonists experience. This makes it for the viewer not easier to swallow. The absence of a soundtrack even increases this effect. This movie has many strong points and although I haven't seen many of the other films who were competing with L'Enfant at the Cannes film festival 2005 I think this film has fairly won the Palme d'Or because it scores very high on the essential aspects of filmmaking acting camerawork see comment by Toon Creemers and script dialogues.I highly recommend this movie but don't expect to be visually entertained the way we are used to by big budget films from Hollywood. Movies like these don't need a lot of dialogue fancy oneliners or historical quotes  the picture says it all in a simple but effective way.Enjoy".

Movies like these don't need a lot of dialogue fancy oneliners or historical quotes  the picture says it all in a simple but effective way.Enjoy";

	schema:reviewBody "The Dardennes who won their second Palme dOr at Cannes this year with L'Enfant The Child describe it as a love story that is also the story of a father. Twentyyearold Bruno Jrmie Renier is a petty thief and scam artist in Seraing an east Belgian steel town who lives off his girlfriend's welfare and impulsively spends whatever he steals. When eighteenyearold Sonia Dborah Franois returns after the birth of their son Jimmy Bruno's far worse than merely unready to accept the responsibility of fatherhood. Unbeknownst to Sonia he decides to sell the baby on the black market. The film is about what happens following this grotesquely illadvised decision. Who is really the child here? Well clearly the story is about Bruno.L'Enfant is urgent with movement and has little talk. As with the 1996 La promesse The Promise 1996 where Jrmie Renier debuted Rosetta 1999 and Le Fils The Son 2003 the action is ceaseless and obsessive and seems almost realtime. But the Dardennes make every minute count. In those rare moments when the hyperkinetic Bruno is momentarily still and the camera looks into his face there's a strong sense of the doubt that will lead to his transformation. When Bruno tells Sonia I'm sorry or I need you and I love you the words carry weight because he doesn't normally ever say such things. But Sonia says You lie as you breathe. L'Enfant is as powerful and accomplished as anything the Dardennes have done and as thoughtprovoking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike some contemporary films that depict unethical behavior as cool and without consequence the films of Jean and Luc Dardenne display a moral center and consequences for people's actions. Their latest effort L'Infant The Child winner of the Palme D'Or at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival is a fully realized powerful work of art that brings back Jeremie Renier ten years after his impressive debut in La Promesse. Set in an industrial city in eastern Belgium L'Infant is shot with the unmistakable Dardenne trademarks a shaky handheld camera natural sounds with no background music a concern for the underclass that globalization left behind and a gritty and realistic look and feel.Bruno Ranier and his girlfriend Sonia Deborah Francois live on the margins. He is a lowlevel thief panhandler and slacker who refuses to work and can only support his girlfriend by illegal means. It is clear that he loves Sonia but only in a playful childlike way not in a manner that recognizes adult responsibility. He lives for the moment rather than in the moment pursuing instant gratification without thinking of how his actions may affect others. When she comes home from the hospital after giving birth to a baby boy she names Jimmy she finds that Bruno has sublet her apartment in order to buy a jazzy windbreaker with stripes. With no apartment to go home to the two are forced to huddle together on a cold embankment.While Sonia waits in a long line for her unemployment check Bruno acting on a tip from a fence impulsively decides on his own to sell Jimmy to a criminally connected adoption agency without thinking about how Sonia will react. When he tells her almost matteroffactly what he did she collapses and is rushed to the hospital. Bruno showing remorse tries to rescind the deal and retrieve Jimmy but is in over his head with a ruthless gang that demands he pay them a small fortune to compensate for their losses. Bruno begs Sonia to take him back and forgive him but she refuses. The more he tries to put his life in order the deeper it sinks into chaos and in a daring chase sequence his reckless actions endanger the life of Steve Jeremie Seard his fourteenyearold artful dodger.The Dardennes do not tell us how to feel about Bruno and we are left to sort out our own reactions. A movie is not a court of justice says JeanPierre Dardenne. We try to make it so that the viewer feels many things about Bruno. When you see him selling the child you think 'No this can't be this is impossible.' But then the more you see him the more you realize he's not just a bastard. You are forced to try to understand the character. Like the Dardenne's earlier films the power of L'Infant is cumulative. As Bruno evolves and we become more aware of his vulnerability our capacity for forgiveness is challenged and the film prompts us to grow along with the character. In an ending that is unique and painfully touching L'Infant achieves a rare authenticity.".

I found myself to be interested in the story from the start. The beginning of the film starts very simply a young mother with a newborn baby searching on the street for what the audience presumes at the time and is later verified to be the father of her child. The storyline then develops more as a sketch of the daytoday living at the bottom of Belgian society. Though despite the fact a grim picture of the central couple's living situation is presented the filmmaker has not crossed the line and has interlaced many lighthearted moments into the movie.The story develops as Bruno the baby's father is quickly shown to have no real interest in the baby or fatherhood just in making money. He also is portrayed to have a genuine love for Sonya. In this sense the audience follows Brunos life knowing not whether to cheer him or pray for his downfall after he makes several questionable choices about the fate of his baby.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple film without Hollywood special effects planned cinematography or any sort of soundtrack. I can see its appeal but personally I came away wondering what exactly the director was trying to prove by making this film. He did succeedhowever to provide a somewhat entertaining if slightly heavy film. The cast are excellent.".

It is clear by the way we see Sonia take care of the baby she is a mother who loves her son.

The shock alone sends Sonia into the hospital where she is inconsolable for the great loss she has suffered. Seeing her in the state she is triggers in Bruno a reaction into getting back the baby.

	schema:reviewBody "L'Infant is the deserving winner of several awards including the prestigious Palm d'Or at Cannes. The directors manage to achieve an engrossing simple and tragic story which weaves several comingofage themes together without sacrificing a second of realism. Although the two leads are equally important to the development of the film the action follows Bruno Jeremie Reinier a troubled unstable young man who lives at the fringes of society stealing and fencing with the help of a couple of young kids. Before the action of the film begins Sonja Deborah Francois a young working class girl trying to make a life for herself has fallen in love with Bruno and had a son with him. In the first few minutes of the film she is carrying the infant through the streets of Seraing searching for Bruno whose only method of contact his cell phone has run out of credit. When the couple are united Bruno seems cheery and hopeful but it is his love for Sonja that we are seeing here and this love though genuine is the immature love of a man whose emotional growth has been stunted by the choices he habitually makes. Throughout most of the rest of the film we are privy to several examples of these choices and Bruno is placed in a position where he must either lose all hope and selfrespect or commit himself to recognize his own responsibility i.e. grow up while the immediate prospects of doing either are unpleasant.The film explores a number of important issues very sympathetically and yet with merciless realism. The film does not even distract its audience with a soundtrack. What is being said in the film is too important to waste on mere entertainment. L'infant is politically libertarian  emphasizing the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions. Attached to this painfully examined central theme are more familiar and obvious issues of adulthood morality love romance fatherhood and survival.The directing and script are flawless. The acting is superb  especially the two leads. You will instantly fall in love with Sonja and as despicable as he is it is hard to avoid feeling the same for Jeremie. And these two young actors accomplish this without a soundtrack excessive editing or a lot of fancy camera work. Bravo! As art L'Infant is as straightforward as you can get. It is unpretentiously filmed in a documentary style with the camera sometimes getting uncomfortably close to the action in order to highlight the emotional impact of the performances. The camera work is subtle and excellent but unlike some of the reviewers I was aware of the presence of the camera at times. Considering the claustrophobic interior sets the lack of any form of distraction from the central plot and the hyperrealism of the film it would be pretty difficult to avoid this completely.As many others have said this is an art film. However its pace is consistent enough and its cinematography subtle enough to make it accessible for standard film audiences. This might be a good way to introduce an openminded friend to true independent as opposed to Indie and nonHollywood film.".

	onyx:emotionText "L'Infant is the deserving winner of several awards including the prestigious Palm d'Or at Cannes. The directors manage to achieve an engrossing simple and tragic story which weaves several comingofage themes together without sacrificing a second of realism. Although the two leads are equally important to the development of the film the action follows Bruno Jeremie Reinier a troubled unstable young man who lives at the fringes of society stealing and fencing with the help of a couple of young kids. Before the action of the film begins Sonja Deborah Francois a young working class girl trying to make a life for herself has fallen in love with Bruno and had a son with him. In the first few minutes of the film she is carrying the infant through the streets of Seraing searching for Bruno whose only method of contact his cell phone has run out of credit. When the couple are united Bruno seems cheery and hopeful but it is his love for Sonja that we are seeing here and this love though genuine is the immature love of a man whose emotional growth has been stunted by the choices he habitually makes. Throughout most of the rest of the film we are privy to several examples of these choices and Bruno is placed in a position where he must either lose all hope and selfrespect or commit himself to recognize his own responsibility i.e. grow up while the immediate prospects of doing either are unpleasant.The film explores a number of important issues very sympathetically and yet with merciless realism. The film does not even distract its audience with a soundtrack. What is being said in the film is too important to waste on mere entertainment. L'infant is politically libertarian  emphasizing the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions.

Their love their strength  each one trying to find a future a new future... with their own means... Through money through surviving through a baby... through tears and the rare basic things of life they know or have been taught of...It's 1h35 you're watching a young man grow... My great enthusiasm for the film is also because of the actors. Jeremie Renier and Deborah Francois... They shine they tremble and they're so true... I will also add the young boy who play Steve..

	schema:reviewBody "A young couple who become parents and live in the underbelly of the world who barely have enough for themselves let alone a child. This child becomes a catalyst for a stark dose of maturity in this morality tale of Bruno and Sonia. When the film begins they live in a carefree world and have no responsibilities. Bruno engages in petty acts of theft and street dealing which gives him enough for a couple of days. He's subletted his apartment to a pair of lovers while Sonia has gone into labor. She is even less prepared for the real world riding in the back of a scooter with her newborn baby she finds what Bruno has done to their apartment. They have to sleep in a tenement apartment in separate bedrooms and even then he finds a quickie deal to make in the wee hours of morning in which a young woman swindles him out of his hat and he is left out in the rain.An impulsive decision though takes place Bruno has sold his child for money. Sonia however is horrified and undergoes a 180degree character change where she fully becomes a mother and shuts Bruno out while putting him under the authorities watchful eye. Even then Bruno hasn't changed he denies little Jimmy is his son and to make matters worse he is being threatened by the men whom he sold his son to where he has to produce 5000 Euros. THE CHILD becomes a morality thriller in which Bruno in getting deeper and deeper into theft and deception walks into a culdesac and if forced to face the stark reality of his own sordid life. The Dardenne brothers present these events with a grimness I haven't seen in a long time  it's as if I were being showed a day in the life of a petty criminal. THE CHILD is a powerful film because it explores themes that most films avoid baby trafficking the neglected those who are at the short end of the stick. It has great moments of nondialog that tell more than a film crackling with words. Jeremie Regnier and Deborah Francois are great in their roles you could believe they were going through this hell in real life. But Regnier is the one whom the film revolves around he is the real Child in the movie the boy who has not grown up who lives in an arrested development who will have to face Life as it is in order to become a Man.".

	schema:reviewBody "When the single mother Sonia Dborah Franois returns home with her newborn son she finds that the baby's father Bruno Jrmie Renier had rented her apartment for a couple. She seeks out Bruno who is a small time young thief that has a gang with two other teenagers on the streets and they go to a shelter to stay during the cold night. On the next morning they register the child with the name of Jimmy. When Bruno receives a proposal from his dealer for selling Jimmy for adoption for five thousand Euros he steals the baby and sells him to his contact. However when Sonia discovers what Bruno did she faints goes to the hospital and reports the transaction to the police. Bruno calls off the transaction and retrieves Jimmy but has to pay to the dealers another five thousand Euros in the beginning of his descent to hell and final redemption.The lowbudget L'Enfant is actually the realistic story of Bruno an indifferent and alienated young scum originated from the upper class but without job for option that steals lies manipulates wanders on the streets and seems incapable of displaying love remorse or any other human feelings. Sonia is not well developed and the viewer never knows who she actually is and why she felt in love for Bruno. Jrmie Renier and Dborah Franois have awesome performances in the lead roles. The conclusion is disappointing since the final redemption of Bruno is inconsistent with his character. Maybe the intention of the writers and directors JeanPierre and Luc Dardenne is to give some hope to the audience instead of the expected dark and credible ending. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Criana The Child".

Normally the Dardenne movies are a little slow p.ex.Le Fils but this movie is not boring at all and the story is very good. Neverteless there is no music in the movie the sounds of the environment are enough to feel how it must be to live in Seraing.".

However there is no other Palm d'Or awardee which is so predictable like this one. I guessed the ending only seven minutes into the movie too late i guess.. The title says it all. Its not the baby. Its the babies. Bruno who seems so nonchalant and casual while he sells his own baby to adoption does look real stupid wondering what wrong did he do while he's at the hospital with his girlfriend. But yes i'd rather prefer rosetta to this movie. The total absence of any music even in a Belgian bar? also adds to the gloomy dull atmosphere in this movie.

She goes to their apartment but finds that Bruno has sublet the place to a bilious couple so she has to track Bruno down at work trying to cadge small change from passers by. He is pleased to see her but diffident towards his son Jimmy.They spend the night in a shelter or rather she does as he cuts his time short to fence his stolen goods to a woman who drops a hint that if they're not up to raising a child they could adopt it out for a good price.After showing us how they can only seem to communicate through adolescent rough housing we are left with the distinct impression that they are too immature for parenthood. A few days later while they wait in line Bruno offers to walk the baby. He then sells it to a baby selling gang and returns to show Sophie the wad of cash. Sophie passes out from shock.We see not one wit of shame or guilt from Bruno up to this point. He is we presume an amoral street thug out for how to make the next buck and found the baby to good an opportunity to pass up for a sizable reward. Besides given the empty life the baby will be looking forward to the adoption by a better off couple doesn't seem to be bad for the child.Sophie passing out seems to bring him to his senses. Is he remorseful? Does he love her? Up to this point all we have seen of their relationship is one of two vapid adolescent children with no hint of any plans to make a future for their offspring.He carries her to a hospital and starts calling his go between to have the deal undone. At this point his motivation is left deliberately unclear. Is he doing so because he regrets his actions and needs to make it up to Sophie or is he doing it because her accusations are over heard by the staff and the police will soon be carting him off to jail? In any event he manages to get the child back giving up the E5000 without a whimper but then faces the angry brokers who are now out their E5000. When he returns to the hospital with the baby the police are there and he makes up the story that he was just pretending to sell the child as revenge for her infidelity and then calmly disowns the child as his.Sophie refuses to talk with him and the police have to back off and at this point in the movie we are no clearer to discerning any hint of empathy stirring in Bruno's pock marked face. I felt sorry for Sophie in her realization that her lover is as calloused as his feet but presumed she would soon allow him back into her life. Yet as morally revolted as I was by Bruno I still wanted to see if he could manage some kind of redemption. The movie ends in leaving us to answer that question ourselves.The crux of the movie is Bruno's character or lack of it. He is no sociopath he is not evil his bland personality is as banal and unattractive as cold soup. He seems to not be dangerous until faced with too much temptation to his greed. Yet he is difficult to hate. He is like that black sheep relative we all have and shake our heads about so that we can whistle past the graveyard of our own inadequacies. He is what humanity can become when the spirit slumbers. He is society's unwitting sin eater.".

I had faintly heard of the Dardenne bros. beforehand and after watching this great work I decided to see their other films. Unfortunately La Promesse is the apex. When I watched their other films such as Le Fils intolerably slow and Rosetta agonizingly slow but good I expected something even just close to the glory of La Promesse but always came out disappointed. L'Enfant is yet another bad one. I was patient enough to watch the first three but by the fourth film I was pressing fast forward through at least 23 of it.It's not surprising that the Cannes Film Festival awarded this film the Palme d'Or a few years ago. L'Enfant is the kind of film people who either are paid to watch or who have lots of time to do so love. It's a socially aware film which chronicles the lives of poor people one which makes viewers from the upper economic stratum feel more socially responsible. Andlet's call a spade a spadeit's not unlikely that critics mostly old white men belong to this group.L'Enfant and La Promesse are both wellmade socially conscious films the main difference is that the latter didn't forget the importance of storytelling which is essentially what films are all about. L'Enfant is realism pushed to the boring extreme. No matter how wellintentioned you are no matter how grave the message it gets lost to a lot of viewers because especially in this day and age our attention spans get shorter and shorter. It is the filmmaker's responsibility to grab the viewer's attention and the Dardenne bros. simply haven't.".

That's the thing about this film it's really simple. Sure it's an interesting story that needs to be told but it's not incredibly insightful or arresting. Being a youngish father myself I never really believed this young couple were parents. The child was a prop. They made it look too easy. It's not really a film about L'Infant the child it's really about two selfish young lovers and this thing wrapped in a blanket. Sure I believe this young woman's going to desire sex with her man the day she returns from the hospital with her new baby. I'm not buying that reality either is my wife. Sure these people exist but this wasn't very compelling story telling. I found ROSETTA much more powerful. And this isn't just the dumb American's opinion my fellow audience members seemed unimpressed as well. Maybe if the film hadn't won the Palme D'or I could give the film some slack.

After reading great things about some of his other films  La Promesse 1996 Rosetta Golden Palm at Cannes 1999 Le Fils 2002 Olivier Gourmet was awarded Best Actor at Cannes  now I understand why they're considered some of the most talented names making films nowadays. Their honesty and strength to tell this poignant story which could easily become an absurd melodrama is mindblowing. L'Enfant gave the Dardenne brothers a second Golden Palm at Cannes and hopefully the pompous award will make more people curious to check this work of art. Nothing is as simple as it seems and as we get into the nightmarish world of Bruno we see he's not only an immature cruel lad who sold his own kid but someone who hasn't even begun to live.Sad and remarkable L'Enfant has some similarities with Hector Babenco's classic Pixote  A Lei do Mais Fraco 1981 and is certainly one of the year's best. 10 out of 10.".

Her parents are dead she is alone and resists but gives in to the stalking by the American G.I. from Omaha. During filming she was 24 but already in her 9th film. Her only true dancing is during the opening ballet numbers and does esentially no singing. Who in their right mind would meet one day spend an evening together not even kiss goodnight and yet decide the next day they are in love and want to get married?  Well maybe in 1944 during the war.  Fortunately for the story they were unaware of all the military 'red tape' to guarantee a 'cooling off period' so he went off to VDay invasion still single. He writes letters she dances they are both lonesome.In her first visit to his aunt in London she gets word that a telegram had been received reporting his being missing and presumably dead. She was devastated. Months later they find out he had been wounded taken in by the French and was coming back and going home. Friends threw a prewedding party permissions were granted but she felt unworthy and tried to run away. In an excruciatingly slow scene in the bedroom where she didn't want to tell him why she finally admitted to having become a 'loose woman' during his presumed death. She had not forgiven herself for not allowing him to spend what she thought was his last night with her.This is a good example of a 50s film not one of Caron's best still highly watchable.".

Also the dialogue in the script written by veterans Sherwood and Behrman holds up after these many years and sits better on my ears than many a television or even movie script today.Gaby reminds me of the film Caron did later about the effects of war on ordinary people in London The Lshaped Room 1962 in which she appears more sophisticated also falling in love with an Englishman but in which there is no committment on his part and no happy ending. As the American serviceman Kerr is a bit stiff in the beginning of this movie but eventually grows into his role and Caron is supple as a dancer in her timing and delivery her English impeccably musical and her face still retaining the innocence and bit of baby fat that we cherish in her American in Paris debut. Because she had such thorough ballet training people tend to remember her in the many musicals with ballet routines but Caron was equally good possibly even better in pure drama such as these two films. Of course the director should be given credit for drawing out the genuine emotion in her performances but she could also do comedy with that great timing that she had see her in Last of the Blonde Bombshells which she did at age seventy with Judi Dench.Caron has an authenticity and committment in her roles that comes across on screen for me the same way Audrey Hepburn does and did from the very beginning in her Roman Holiday debut. Not only were Caron and Hepburn real persons  with inner lives who not so incidentally had witnessed and survived WW II when they were tapped by and discovered for the movies they also didn't go through the technical hoops of acting training that the professionals of today bring to similar roles. Actresses of today tend to bring more training and acting talent to their roles but less inner complexity resulting in for me a less authentic performance regardless of the high budget and publicity hoopla.Supporting roles by Taina Elg Cedric Hardwicke and Margallo Gillmore also do not let the movie down. Taina is better in Gaby than in the frivolous but enjoyable Les Girls. And Hardwicke had such a distinguished career that one cannot imagine him consenting to play this very minor part if he didn't think the whole project worthwhile. In sum highly recommended and requiring hankies for the vulnerable.".

The original play was by Robert E. Sherwood also known for The Petrified Forest.This remake fails on several counts. First of all there is almost no atmosphere. There is beautiful saturated color and cinemascope neither of which add anything specific to the story. Furthermore the sets in many scenes especially at the end in the bombing are so obviously fake you can almost imagine stagehands picking up the pieces for the next performance.Second no matter how hard she tries Leslie Caron is not convincing as a prostitute. As a dancer yes. When she abandons dance for prostitution we do not see a transition. She gives as a reason for her actions remorse over sending Greg away before their love was consummated. Now that he is dead she wants to give others what she deprived him of. A rather shaky rationalization.Third no matter how hard he tries John Kerr is incapable of playing a grownup. He is forever the boyish young man awkward in speech and movement. The film does not have a smooth trajectory. The individual scenes seem to be patched together. The ending likewise is not convincing. He forgives her as if all she had done was to ruin the souffl. They seem like two kids in love playing around with adult games.The fault for all of this lies in the general concept of this particular remake which the producers obviously felt had to be more sugarcoated for the audience of the midfifties unwilling no doubt to accept Leslie Caron as a bad girl. But in the end nothing is gained by this strategy.However there is still some charm  almost unavoidable when Leslie Caron is the star  and some moments that show the promise of what might have been a very good movie.".

The film has a few shortcomings. It would have been nice to see more of Leslie Caron's dancing since she was a professional ballerina who performed in Roland Petit's Ballet des ChampsElysees. Also her role as a disillusioned prostitute could have been presented more effectively.Gaby 1956 is significantly different from Waterloo Bridge 1931 and 1940 and has merit in its own right.This is an underrated film.

	schema:headline " The third and weakest film adaptation of 'Waterloo Bridge'";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1931 and 1940 films both named 'Waterloo Bridge' are very highly recommended and are very good films in their own right with the slight edge going to the 1940 film despite being less faithful to the original story.Although it is a long way from a bad film 'Gaby' isn't in the same league. There are a lot of things to like with the best things being Leslie Caron who despite being unconvincing as a prostitute and the transition is even less convincing beguiles and charms in the lead and the luminous Metrocolor cinematography that gives the film a quaint 1950s sheen the use of Cinemascope is also striking.Further great assets are the beautiful and never too sugary or melodramatic music score and the timeless RodgersHartpenned Where or When. The two French songs Sur Le Pont D'Avignon faring the slightly better of the two My Country Tis of Thee and Chopin's Piano Concerto are also well used just not leaving as big an impression in the film as When or When. The dialogue is thoughtprovoking some of the sets are nicely done and atmospheric and the supporting cast especially a distinguished Cedric Hardwicke acquit themselves very well.However John Kerr's performance is very onedimensional with stiffness and awkwardness being the only real emotions he shows. Even those not completely enamoured with Robert Taylor's performance in the 1940 film will find themselves appreciating it more after seeing Kerr I certainly did. His chemistry with Caron is quite bland too. 'Gaby' is also very dully directed by Curtis Bernhardt with the film never seeming to find proper momentum.It is agreed that there is a lack of atmosphere the 1931 film was gritty at times steamy and dark while the 1940 film while due to the Code and its constraints tamer and more romanticised was very lovingly romantic lavish and incredibly poignant. These are things that other than a lavishness in the cinematography and some of the costumes and sets 'Gaby' lacks dullness and glimpses of sugary charm being the primary feelings here. The ending is pure contrived tack as problematic as the ending of the 1931 film was it was still more believable than this and things are all far too easily forgiven.

	onyx:emotionText "The 1931 and 1940 films both named 'Waterloo Bridge' are very highly recommended and are very good films in their own right with the slight edge going to the 1940 film despite being less faithful to the original story.Although it is a long way from a bad film 'Gaby' isn't in the same league. There are a lot of things to like with the best things being Leslie Caron who despite being unconvincing as a prostitute and the transition is even less convincing beguiles and charms in the lead and the luminous Metrocolor cinematography that gives the film a quaint 1950s sheen the use of Cinemascope is also striking.Further great assets are the beautiful and never too sugary or melodramatic music score and the timeless RodgersHartpenned Where or When. The two French songs Sur Le Pont D'Avignon faring the slightly better of the two My Country Tis of Thee and Chopin's Piano Concerto are also well used just not leaving as big an impression in the film as When or When. The dialogue is thoughtprovoking some of the sets are nicely done and atmospheric and the supporting cast especially a distinguished Cedric Hardwicke acquit themselves very well.However John Kerr's performance is very onedimensional with stiffness and awkwardness being the only real emotions he shows. Even those not completely enamoured with Robert Taylor's performance in the 1940 film will find themselves appreciating it more after seeing Kerr I certainly did. His chemistry with Caron is quite bland too. 'Gaby' is also very dully directed by Curtis Bernhardt with the film never seeming to find proper momentum.It is agreed that there is a lack of atmosphere the 1931 film was gritty at times steamy and dark while the 1940 film while due to the Code and its constraints tamer and more romanticised was very lovingly romantic lavish and incredibly poignant. These are things that other than a lavishness in the cinematography and some of the costumes and sets 'Gaby' lacks dullness and glimpses of sugary charm being the primary feelings here. The ending is pure contrived tack as problematic as the ending of the 1931 film was it was still more believable than this and things are all far too easily forgiven. Gaby's transformation is too sudden and some of the sets are on the cheap and cobbled together side.All in all watchable thanks to Caron and the cinematography but anybody who loved the previous two 'Waterloo Bridge' film adaptations like this reviewer did will find themselves disappointed. 510 Bethany Cox";

Making his way out to find female companionship Mr. Kerr collides with pretty French ballerina Leslie Caron as Gaby. He is smitten. She is not. After watching her dance Mr. Kerr visits Ms. Caron backstage. She gradually becomes interested and they begin a whirlwind romance. They want to consummate but are unable to get married due to their alien status. Caron decides to save herself like they used to say while he goes back into battle. Alas he's reported dead. Feeling bad about not giving Kerr something to remember Caron decides to give it up for other soldiers...It turns out the news about Kerr wasn't exactly accurate...Gaby has been criticized for sanitizing the opening status of Caron's character and altering the original ending of Robert E. Sherwood's play Waterloo Bridge 1930 which previously impressed film critics in versions starring Mae Clarke 1931 and Vivien Leigh 1940. However the important alteration is in timing note the explicit exchange where Caron ends with Not a man GregMEN! The problem this time is that Caron shows little degradation during this period she appears chic and confident throughout. The different ending while not as memorable can be applauded for not punishing Gaby for her perceived sinful behavior. The revisions aren't as bad as they seem...Possibly restrained by the production values director Curtis Bernhardt is unable to give the story enough intimacy...Caron could have shown some interest in Kerr during their first encounters and still been standoffish. They're supposed to be drawn to each other as if they were destined to meet. This is touched upon in a scene hinting at reincarnation. The reincarnation mention may have also been included to support MGM's use of Where or When by Rogers and Hart as the film's theme. The timeless song is used well. Another revision is having Kerr sustain a symbolic wound yet it is another addition which doesn't fully take full advantage of the dramatic opportunities. Veteran stage actress Margalo Gillmore as Helen Carrington has a couple of outstanding scenes. In spite of all the costars are a nice couple.

	schema:reviewBody "Preminger's adaptation of G. B. Shaw's ''Saint Joan''screenplay by Graham Greene received one of the worst critical reactions in it's day. It was vilified by the pseudoelite the purists and the audiences was unresponsive to a film that lacked the piety and glamour expected of a historical pageant. As in ''Peeping Tom'' the reaction was malicious and unjustified. Preminger's adaptation of Shaw's intellectual exploration of the effects and actions surrounding Joan of Archer actual name in her own language is Jeanne d'Arc but this film is in English is totally faithful to the spirit of the original play not only on the literal emotional level but formally too. His film is a Brechtian examination of the functioning of institutions the division within and without of various factions all wanting to seize power. As such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the characters including Joan herself.As played by Jean Sebergwhose subsequent life offers a eerie parallel to her role here she is presented as an innocent a figure of purity whose very actions and presence reveals the corruption and emptiness in everyone. As such Seberg plays her as both Saint and Madwoman. Her own lack of experience as an actress when she made this filmwhich does show up in spots conveys the freshness and youth of Jeanne revealing both the fact that Jeanne la Pucelle is a humble illiterate peasant girl who strode out to protect her village and her natural intelligence. By no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film's first release it's a performance far beyond the ken and call of any firsttime actress with no prior acting experience. Shaw and Preminger took a secular view towards Joan seeing her as a medieval era feminist not content with being a rustic daughter who's fate is to be married away or a whore picked up by soldiers to and away from battlefields. Her faith her voices her visions which she intermingles with words such as imagination and common sense leads her to wear the armour of her fellow soldiers to lead them to battle to chase the invading Englishman out of France.And yet it can be said that the film is more interested in the court of the DauphinRichard Widmark the office of the clergy who try Joan led by Pierre CauchonAnton Walbrook impeccably cast and the actions of the Earl of WarwickJohn Gielgud then in Joan herself. The superb ensemble castall male portray figures of scheming Machievellianalthough the story precedes Niccolo opportunists who treat religion as a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own ends. The sharp sardonic dialogue gives the actors great fun to let loose. John Gielgud as the eminently rational Earl whose intelligencealbeit accompanied by corruption allows him to calculate the precise manner in which he can ensure Joan gets burnt at the stake and Anton Walbrook's Pierre Cauchon brings a three dimensional portrait to this intelligent theologian who will give Joan the fair trial that will certainly find her guilty. Richard Widmark as the Dauphin is a real revelation. As againsttype a casting choice you'll ever find Widmark portrays the weak future ruler of France in a frenzied comic caricature that's as close as this film comes to comic relief. A comic performance that feels like an imitation of Jerry Lewis far more than an impetuous future ruler of France.Preminger shot ''Saint Joan'' in black and white the cinematographer is Georges Perinal who worked with Rene Clair and who did ''The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp'' in colour. It's perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film. Preminger's preference for tracking shots of long uninterrupted takes is key to the effectiveness of the film there's no sense of a wasted movement anywhere in his miseenscene.It also marks the direction of Preminger's most matureand most neglected period his focus is on the conflict between individuals and the institutions in which they work how the institution function and how the individual acts as per his principles. These themes get their most direct treatment in his film and as always he keeps things unpredictable and finds no black and white answers. This is one of his very best and most effective films.".

	schema:headline " This is Shaw NOT Who have you";
	schema:reviewBody "Most of the comments made on this film suggest that the writers have neither read nor seen the George Bernard Shaw play on which it is based. Shaw in St. Joan as in every single one of his plays is all about talk. It's impossible to make an action movie out of a Shaw play without doing it irremediable violence. St. Joan is a play about Nationalism and Protestantism ideas that did not even exist in the period when the play is set. Shaw's St. Joan IS a French nationalist which is what makes her an anathema to the British. Shaw's St. Joan IS a Protestant inspired directly by the spirit of God unmediated by the Church and that is why she is an anathema to the Catholic authorities. Preminger's St. Joan is an adaptation of the play and because the play in important respects utterly defies film conventions the movie is mediocre. Anyone who wants to understand St. Joan as Shaw conceived her needs either to read or see the play preferably both. Unfortunately St. Joan is rarely performed these days partly because Shaw has fallen out of fashion but also because it takes an extraordinary young actress to perform convincingly as Shaw's Maid a warrior child whose voices speak common sense to her  and there aren't too many of those around. If a director wishes to make another FILM about Jean d'Arc as someone somewhere some time will undoubtedly want to do Shaw's play is not the place to look.

	onyx:emotionText "Most of the comments made on this film suggest that the writers have neither read nor seen the George Bernard Shaw play on which it is based. Shaw in St. Joan as in every single one of his plays is all about talk. It's impossible to make an action movie out of a Shaw play without doing it irremediable violence. St. Joan is a play about Nationalism and Protestantism ideas that did not even exist in the period when the play is set. Shaw's St. Joan IS a French nationalist which is what makes her an anathema to the British. Shaw's St. Joan IS a Protestant inspired directly by the spirit of God unmediated by the Church and that is why she is an anathema to the Catholic authorities. Preminger's St. Joan is an adaptation of the play and because the play in important respects utterly defies film conventions the movie is mediocre. Anyone who wants to understand St. Joan as Shaw conceived her needs either to read or see the play preferably both. Unfortunately St. Joan is rarely performed these days partly because Shaw has fallen out of fashion but also because it takes an extraordinary young actress to perform convincingly as Shaw's Maid a warrior child whose voices speak common sense to her  and there aren't too many of those around. If a director wishes to make another FILM about Jean d'Arc as someone somewhere some time will undoubtedly want to do Shaw's play is not the place to look. It belongs to the stage or the page not the movies.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Joan of Arc story is always a hard one to deal with especially for skeptics. Did she really hear voices divinely inspired that put the burden of liberating France on her 17 year old shoulders? Or should she have been locked in a loony bin? I'm not really sure that any other culture than the French ought to be telling her story inevitably the interpretation will fall short of the mark. It falls short here because we have two diametrically opposed viewpoints working on the treatment.The key to this film is that it is adapted from a play by George Bernard Shaw by Graham Greene. So we have the writing of a Fabian Socialist being interpreted by one very Catholic writer. I think there's a great deal more Greene than Shaw.Shaw gets his innings here but I think Graham Greene dominates the film. If he had lived I'm sure Shaw would not have approved.Charles VIII in history or as portrayed by Richard Widmark here or Jose Ferrer in the Ingrid Bergman film about Joan of Arc is not the noblest of monarchs. If you are a good Catholic what he did was going against the will of the Deity. Otherwise though what he tries to do in consolidating his gains makes perfect good sense.It's funny that I did a review of Olivier's Henry V which viewed from the English point of view which shows how the French got in the situation they were in. What happens afterwards is that Henry V dies quite suddenly like Alexander the Great and England with an infant monarch and fifty year plus struggle for power implodes internally.Before he died however Charles VII disowned his son the Dauphin and blessed the marriage of Henry V to his daughter Katherine with the provision that Henry succeed Charles VII as King. The French for good reason do not list the English Henry as one of their kings.Enter Joan of Arc whose visions inspire an army and a nation. As played by Jean Seberg she's in the right age group to be sure. But I think Ingrid Bergman being the far more skilled professional carries it off better in her film. Ditto for Jose Ferrer instead of Richard Widmark. The best acted parts in this film are Anton Walbrook as Cauchon the Bishop who presided over the trial and the clever and serpentine John Gielgud as the Earl of Warwick.Maybe if Otto Preminger had chosen to film pure Shaw Saint Joan would have been better received.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mankind has always interfered in the individual's right to have a one on one relationship with God in a way which they do not understand. George Bernard Shaw's play asks the question whether or not organized religion has the right to call someone a heretic because they have been given the gift of hearing God's voice and trying to spread their message in a way which the church doesn't approve. Like The Song of Bernadette and The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima it is a woman who is the vessel of God's word a taboo back in the day especially in Joan of Arc's era. The fact that she dresses in man's clothes also makes her a target especially when she goes into battle wearing a suit of armor and carrying a sword.This is a difficult film to assess and even more difficult to get into but once the message does get through and you accept Jean Seberg in the part which many believe she was miscast in the film will grab your soul and you will feel the emotional pain Joan must have felt as she realizes what denying her quest means in her spiritual journey. Seberg's Joan is much more waif like than Ingrid Bergman's was and she seems more age appropriate. Of course there are those who are going to use her lack of acting experience against her even though her vulnerability does shine through amongst the more experienced actors. The fact that she does appear to be an emotionally fragile 19 year old works totally for her as she must face the variety of zealots and chauvinistic men who hold her future in their hands. It certainly was daring of director Otto Preminger to cast her and in various aspects of her performance it is a wise choice rather to have cast someone more well known like Natalie Wood.On the other hand the presence of such veteran actors as Richard Widmark Felix Aylmer John Gielgud and Anton Walbrook add authority as the men so her almost emotionless performance becomes more profound as their judgments against her get more and more authoritarian. This is a film which builds emotionally as her fate becomes more sealed filmed sort of like Orson Welles' MacBeth and Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal in a dark dreamlike state that is half dream half nightmare. The minutes leading up to her execution are profoundly intense and the burning itself is almost unbearable.Told as if a ghostly visit after her demise Saint Joan is perhaps not the definitive film version of Shaw's classic play but for what Preminger did it deserves to be noticed more than the mediocre reviews it initially received. Pretty much every character is given a chance to identify the fact that they are aware that if they are revealed to have been wrong about her they know they are damned and yet Joan's ghostly return offers a chance of atonement for some damnation for others. At any rate it is one of those spiritual dramas which deserves to open discussion on many fronts especially with the idea that God speaks to everybody in different ways that God does show many faces and that as human beings with weaknesses strengths vulnerabilities and passions we can never understand why God chooses to deal with humanity the way he does.".

Instead we are shown all the many motives underlying both the French and English who held Normandy politicos and priests who put her to death.  Even the worst hypocrite of them all the archbishop leaves us with the thought that Of course she was innocent.  The innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the mighty.  She had no idea what she was saying no idea of the implications of blasphemy or going against the church.  Unschooled she had no idea of what the church's stand on such matters even was.Preminger was true to the myths surrounding her death and I appreciated the preview on the tape that showed the flames reaching up and burning her. Why?  They used gas jets in the movie and 2 of them were stopped up. Suddenly the air pressure blew out the stoppage and the flames leaped up right on her.  Thankfully for her they didn't have to repeat the shot as it was SO realistic she WAS being burned!!  Pretty traumatic introduction for an Iowa girl to her new career of acting.John Gielgud performed outstandingly.  He is the English politico who is orchestrating the show.  He also makes the point that once you condemn someone to death you don't want to be around to watch them die.  You might shrink from your 'duty' the next time...not that such delicacies bother the soul of our wouldbe president.  We Christians even the most antiSemitic have no problem with falling back on the Old Testament when it comes to capital punishment even though it was overridden by Jesus' words.  Bring on public executions like this little girl's.  Smelling burnt flesh might bring us respectable folks to our souls' senses.The only little 'pick' I have about this film is that we are not shown why the priest who has been so adamantly urging her burning becomes so suddenly so contrite even to the point of madness.  There should have been more expansion of his character more dialogueas the sudden 'coming to his senses' doesn't make sense.And whether Graham Greene does this deliberately or not St. Joan is such a selfassured little upstart you almost but not quite are glad she meets her comeuppance.  And when she turned down life in prison for some reason I thought of Anne Sexton the poet who accused Sylvia Plath of 'stealing her death' when she committed suicide ...knowing such an action guarantees immortality. You gotta wonder!!If ever there was a good example of obsessive thought and logictight compartments this is one.  St. Joan should have turned Buddhist and quieted the 'voices in her mind'.".

And when she turned down life in prison for some reason I thought of Anne Sexton the poet who accused Sylvia Plath of 'stealing her death' when she committed suicide ...knowing such an action guarantees immortality. You gotta wonder!!If ever there was a good example of obsessive thought and logictight compartments this is one.  St. Joan should have turned Buddhist and quieted the 'voices in her mind'.";

While watching this movie it's important to remember that the characterization of Joan of Arc varies widely from the crazy Joan Pucelle as characterized in Shakespeare's Henry VI Part I to a total otherworldly religious victim as seen in Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic La Passion et la Mort de Jeanne d'Arc. Shaw wanted to present his Joan differently and this movie is about Shaw's Joan. Preminger and Greene present a noble effort of Shaw's play. It is entertaining in that it tells a good story without over romanticizing Joan nor over vilifying her chief executioner Cauchon Anton Walbrook. Dunois Bastard of Orleans Richard Todd supports Joan's efforts and serves as her fellow soldierinarms. Richard Widmarkas the Dauphin that Joan makes Charles VIIplays his role as a childish clown. Finally Sir John Gielgud admirably presents the English side of this story as he portrays Warwick. This movie is quite worth whileespecially for Shaw fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "She has been remembered in history as the peasant girl who was accused of heresy for hearing voices telling her to drive the English out of France during part of a time in what would be remembered as the Hundred Years' War. But to a lesser extent she would be remembered for eventually having her name cleared and be made a saint in 1920.It is the story which began in 1456 25 years after the trial of Joan of Arc with the aging King Charles VII Richard Widmark searching around the palace for his subjects before the ghost of Joan Jean Seberg appears in front of him. He would recall how she entered his life as a 17yearold peasant girl arriving at the palace when he was still a Dauphin in Chinon but still being constantly bullied by others telling him she had heard the voices of Saints Catherine and Margaret who told her to lead the army against the English at Orleans. But before Joan found her way to the palace in a soldier's armour she managed to convince the local squire Captain Robert de Baudricourt Archie Duncan who initially had his doubts over Joan to let her lead an army.Among those who helped out in Joan's quest is Jean de Dunios Bastard of Orleans Richard Todd or whom she always calls him Jack. It turns out despite after Charles had been crowned king what Joan has done has earned her enemies in high places even as she became popular with the masses grew in confidence and having apparent supernatural powers. Jack would come to be one of the very few who believed in Joan. Joan wants Charles to retake Paris from the English but she was stopped by the newlycrowned king himself and the archbishop Finlay Currie who threatened her that she would be disowned by the church which she has always put her faith in for her quests if she did so. Her decision to still march on to Paris would be paid with a heavy price when she would be eventually captured by the English and be tried.There are times when it feels like the story has been disjointed as the film progresses as what happened in the opening scene shows up in the epilogue of the original version of the 1923 play written by George Bernard Shaw which acted as the base for the film itself. As for those who are not familiar with the story of Joan of Arc it can look confusing with no background information showing on the screen at the pivotal moments in the life of Joan leading up to the trial itself.When it comes to what the film might had implied in terms of what was to blame for Joan's final fate before she was absolved of her original 'crime' it is still up to the viewer to decide whether it is what the film implies or not but without any form of prenotion that is if they have some kind of prior knowledge.Overall it is a film to help especially those who are not aware of the story of Joan of Arc and what led her to do what she did despite her background and what would to be of her final fate before being made a saint despite the confusing elements in the film itself in terms of how it is presented.".

Preminger who reportedly held the piece in the highest regard since his youth was perhaps too close to it to put together a fully satisfying movie.

I've never before seen how an octopus lures it's pray instead of catching it and so forth.But as I claimed before  this one is for nature lovers only the rest better avoid this god forbids they'd become environmentally aware.";

	schema:headline " Beautiful landscape lacks coherence but well worth watching";
	schema:reviewBody "Following the proud tradition of French Dockumentaries like Travelling Birds Thierry Piantanida and Thierry Ragobert take us on a journey through the arctic regions.The images are very beautiful the scenery breathtaking and seeing the amazing herds of animals pass is something everyone should see at least once. Overall a very solid and entertaining look at animal life in the arctic circle.Minor spoilers follow from here on! Unfortunately the movie lacks coherence. It fails to draw a portrait of the landscape hopping around wildly and fails to draw a portrait of the arctic animals making a limited selection but going rather for the images with the most impact than for a fair representation of the species observed. Further the view taken is rather anthropomorphic putting human traits and characteristics on animals. Admittedly I am not quite fair to this movie comparing it to the excellent Travelling Birds but I was left with the strong feeling that the makers of this documentary attempted to emulate the success of that movie. This and the failure thereof was for me especially noticeable during the scenes with the ice bears. The mother bear was strongly humanized and the drive to include as many spectator drawing pictures as possible quite evident.Certain scenes like the whale scenes left me with the impression that the film makers ran out of other impressive material so they kind of threw them in...everyone likes whales right? And this is a nature documentary with some environmental undertones so we need to have whales right? Wrong I would say these scenes were distracting and illfitting with the rest of the film. They were very impressive and beautiful though.So finally I would recommend everyone to see this film once just for the beauty and impact of the pictures. Ignore the commentary which is relatively sparse anyway. Do not look for a coherent story or complete picture and don't have too high expectations. Keeping this in mind you are in for 86 minutes of an entertaining documentary.".

	schema:reviewBody "I should first admit that I saw this film about a week after watching the Ice Worlds episode of the BBC's Planet Earth series and perhaps that set the bar a fair measure higher than usual and contributed to my negative response to The White Planet.But never before have I experienced such disappointment with a nature documentary and never before have I been able to pinpoint precisely what I didn't like about a film of any genre.Firstly the actual photography. The film's promotional material implores you to see this film on as big a screen as possible. If the footage was of the quality deserving cinematic projection then I would agree. Unfortunately it's not. From what I can gather the film is a patchy collage of the work of the world's greatest polar nature filmmakers  and it shows. Some parts were better than others but on the whole the images were grainy soft and certainly not as impressive as one would expect from a genre which is fundamentally based on its photography.Secondly the editing. No attempt was made to edit narrative sequences together. It's as if they've just picked a whole bunch of shots and crudely slapped them together with no sense of constructive order. The film jumps from animal to animal without actually identifying what each is but that's a narration gripe without providing any context for the behaviour we are witnessing on screen and therefore rendering most shots fairly meaningless. Oh yes there's an angry looking polar bear running across the ice  but what is it running from? Or running to? Why is it running at all? Never mind here are some of those fluorescent jellyfish and other deep sea creatures.Thirdly the narration. To be fair it was not so much a problem with the voice or presentation style of the narrator as with the sporadic shallow and sometimes pretentious script. The constant reference to polar bears as Lords of the Ice Planet Beluga whales as Sea Canaries of the White Planet and their 'mysterious concert song still that still holds many secrets and mystery'... it all grew a bit tiresome. I also thought that one of the basic purposes of the narration in a film on the weird and wonderful creatures of the far corners of the globe would be to tell you what they are. Polar bears and seals are pretty obvious but very little information was provided on exactly what other animals we were seeing on screen or even exactly where we were seeing them Canada? Alaska? Where???.Finally the sound track. It was god awful. Fair enough if they didn't have the money to invest in scoring a symphony orchestra to compliment the vision but silence would have been better than the mismatched yodellingchantingdrum beatinginterpretive dance type tracks which in no way tied in with the vision on screen. It sounded like they picked a world music compilation CD out of the discount bin and randomly placed tracks along the timeline with complete disregard for the images they were accompanying. Also I am convinced that they recorded the sound of a child licking a lollipop to use for any scene where a newborn animal caribou polar bear anything was being licked by its mother....maybe all a little harsh and I really don't like to be so critical but I have never been so sure of the reasons for my dislike of a film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was actually really surprised at the ratings of the film so I looked at many of the reviews before putting mine down. Maybe I was missing some pretty horrible aspects to the movie. So I watched the movie again and I read the reviews. I think one of the interesting things was that people rated this movie really low because they didn't like the concept of an evil child or they added there was no WHY concept to the reasons why the character did the things he did. I think I was mostly surprised at the Why concept. Did people really not understand that this kid felt really powerful controlling the fate of others? It was quite clear that the mean kid did not like being undermined. It was in my opinion very well introduced. At first his enjoyment in his actions were very minor due to his first time. It seemed to me that the first time he performed his bad deeds to his brother he might have actually been scarred or stunned. Because for a while when little Frodo enters the scene nothing has actually happened to indicate he is a terrible child. Its not until his mother treats Frodo like her own child that Macually starts to use his will to force things the way he wants. I see similarities with how kids these days press their parents into getting what they want. I think its important to recognize the scene where little Frodo goes to the therapist and asks her about why someone could be bad for no reason just because he likes to be bad. I think this is where people kind of go yeah this movie is flawed there's no such thing. But remember little Frodo wasn't looking down the staircase at his mother hugging another son. Its all about perspective. It can be concluded that the bad son is probably the spoiled child and acts up in extreme ways to get what he wants because it worked before. We have two polar characters. One character is completely helpless and his fate is controlled by the other characters in this movie where there is Culkin whom has deep control of his life and his wants. On another note kids doing horrible things to animals or killing other kids is not a unheard of concept. In fact there is evidence to suggest that there are certain mentalities that cannot be explained but diagnosed with mental disorders. People in our age have been brainwashed into thinking that kids are completely innocent in the world. Which is funny when you reflect how many times in your younger life you have laughed at someone and probably made them feel really bad even though you didn't want to. As kids we actually hurt others more than we'd like to admit we just choose not to admit it.".

	schema:headline " Dark insight into sociopathic children";
	schema:reviewBody "I think part of the reason why 'The Good Son' is barely remembered is because it deals with a side to humanity that noone really wants to accept in that not all children are sweet little innocents pure as the driven snow. It's not very comfortable watching a film that shows sociopaths people born without the ability to feel guilt and empathise with others are born not made and their dangerous traits are apparent even in childhood. 'The Good Son' revolves around Mark a motherless boy of twelve who is sent to stay with his Uncle Wallace Aunt Susan and two cousins twelveyearold Henry and sixyearold Connie. At first Mark revels in the visit that takes his mind off his recent bereavement but he soon starts to realise that Henry is a sociopath whose parents are blind to his dark violent side. It is a film that pulls no punches in just how malevolent Henry is and how easily he will pick off anyone who dares to interfere with his twisted sense of fun.Macaulay Culkin was excellent as the angeliclooking Henry whose boyish cuteness hide his true nature and his performance here proves he could have been one of the few child actors who graduated into a successful young adult actor had his personal life not been such a mess. It really was chilling seeing the child I was so used to seeing in comedies being so emotionally cold. But it is Elijah Wood's Mark who gives the film heart. Young Wood only eleven years old when he filmed this delivered a great performance as a young boy faced with the awful truth and desperate to stop Henry while juggling his grief over losing his mother. The scene where Mark is convinced Henry has poisoned the food is a perfect example of how Wood portrayed Mark's desperation hysteria and helplessness in the face of his cousin's evil.However one of the flaws of the film is that is a bit choppy jumping from scenetoscene without giving you a feel for the other characters which is a shame because this is one film where you do need to have an understanding of just how Henry's nature affects all those around him and how he gets away with it all. I read the novelisation of the film by Todd Strasser before seeing the film so it's all the more noticeable for me. The book not only gives greater insight into Mark's budding fraternal friendship with Connie and his need to seek a mother in Susan but it also shows Susan's growing awareness to the monster Henry is and how she feels when she is made to choose between Mark and her murderous child.Overall this film is enjoyable enough for a psychological thriller although a few TV detective shows have done this idea in a slicker way and it is nice to see a film that doesn't take a softlysoftly attitude when dealing with the matter of children who kill. However the ending was a bit of a copout as there could have been so many other avenues to explore had things ended differently for Henry what should be done with sociopathic children? How do decent loving families deal with such a child?. Those who do expect a bit more from their films will probably be disappointed.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think part of the reason why 'The Good Son' is barely remembered is because it deals with a side to humanity that noone really wants to accept in that not all children are sweet little innocents pure as the driven snow. It's not very comfortable watching a film that shows sociopaths people born without the ability to feel guilt and empathise with others are born not made and their dangerous traits are apparent even in childhood. 'The Good Son' revolves around Mark a motherless boy of twelve who is sent to stay with his Uncle Wallace Aunt Susan and two cousins twelveyearold Henry and sixyearold Connie. At first Mark revels in the visit that takes his mind off his recent bereavement but he soon starts to realise that Henry is a sociopath whose parents are blind to his dark violent side. It is a film that pulls no punches in just how malevolent Henry is and how easily he will pick off anyone who dares to interfere with his twisted sense of fun.Macaulay Culkin was excellent as the angeliclooking Henry whose boyish cuteness hide his true nature and his performance here proves he could have been one of the few child actors who graduated into a successful young adult actor had his personal life not been such a mess. It really was chilling seeing the child I was so used to seeing in comedies being so emotionally cold. But it is Elijah Wood's Mark who gives the film heart. Young Wood only eleven years old when he filmed this delivered a great performance as a young boy faced with the awful truth and desperate to stop Henry while juggling his grief over losing his mother. The scene where Mark is convinced Henry has poisoned the food is a perfect example of how Wood portrayed Mark's desperation hysteria and helplessness in the face of his cousin's evil.However one of the flaws of the film is that is a bit choppy jumping from scenetoscene without giving you a feel for the other characters which is a shame because this is one film where you do need to have an understanding of just how Henry's nature affects all those around him and how he gets away with it all.

Personally I find his calm and apparently effortless demeanour more frightening than the ravings of the lunatics in many other horror films.Unfortunately the plot lacks all credibility. Certainly psychopaths are excellent conmen in fact they are the most typical conmen but it is absurd to believe that a child like this could have covered his tracks so well that his parents do not even suspect that there is something wrong with him. Even more ridiculous is that his behaviour towards his little sister  whom he hates enough to try to kill her  has been so good in the past that she trusts him completely.

Where was I?  Yes standard thriller.  A is really an evil person intent on performing great harm in the future B knows this but can't convince anyone else.  I heard that sigh.  But make A and B children on the verge of adolescence and not only is this tired formula invigorated but it makes a great deal more sense.  Especially if B is in the slightly awkward position of a cousin on an extended visit. The creaky old scenes where B goes to the police and either he is strangely incoherent or the police are strangely obtuse are gone.  There is now a perfectly good reason why B can't go to the police or indeed anyone.  Nor is there anything strange about the obtuseness of A's parents.  The rotten adult seems so commonplace that we scarcely bat an eyelid the rotten child who is in fact far more commonplace we like to pretend doesn't exist.So I'm glad Hollywood took this step.  I also for the most part like the way the step has been taken.  B has no accomplices  he must battle A alone  and his plight is keenly felt.  There's an air of plausibility about it all.  Elijah Wood is an unusually good boy Macaulay Culkin is an unusually bad boy both look perfectly real.  Wood who has the harder task does especially well.The climax  or what is meant to be the climax  is HIGHLY contrived.  It will probably come as a shock that the writers chose something at once so obvious and so ludicrous.  The mood of the audience I saw this with  it may just have been my mood  was one of grudging acceptance granted only because we had been treated so well in the events leading up to it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was okay not particularly wonderful but not awful either it's the type of film you catch by accident on a Sunday afternoon it's briefly entertaining but then you turn off the tv and forget about it. I'll just give you a quick review of what I thought were the best and worst aspects of this movie. Bad aspects the storyline was lame and poorly portrayed as the script was lacking and the pacing off. Macauly Culkin said everything in the same monotonous tone to watch it you'd think he was just passing by the set and had reluctantly agreed to stand in for the real actor and read the lines off a board. The woman who played the mother was just plain irritating to the point where you wished the evil son would just get it over with already! The ending was lousy and a letdown for the partially promising tension the young actors Culkin and Wood had previously established. SPOILER no mother would ever do that! SPOILER FINISHED You're maybe wondering why I watched this movie then well one simple factor Elijah Wood. I borrowed the tape off a friend because I had heard he was on it and being a longtime fan of his I was eager to see it. I was not disappinted he played the part with such rare innocence and sweetness you had to go 'awwww' as soon as he appeared your eyes were drawn immediately to him and he carried the film remarkably well. Having seen this film I am more convinced than ever that Elijah is going to be the actor of his generation and I am sure that his work in the masterpiece LOTR will soon go rewarded with an Oscar in either 2003 or 2004. He takes a film which could have been a total loss and turned it into something oddly unique and touching. Apologies for gushing but I cannot resist even at the age of 12 Elijah had the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen I wish him the very best because any actor that could take this film and turn it into something I would be happy to watch again deserves all the credit and praise going. I can't tell you whether to see this film or not if you are an Elijah fan it's unmissable but if not I am unsure whether this film will draw you in enough and hold your interest long enough. Conclusion film 45 out of 10 Elijah Wood10 out of 10 Good luck Elijah!!".

	onyx:emotionText "This film was okay not particularly wonderful but not awful either it's the type of film you catch by accident on a Sunday afternoon it's briefly entertaining but then you turn off the tv and forget about it. I'll just give you a quick review of what I thought were the best and worst aspects of this movie. Bad aspects the storyline was lame and poorly portrayed as the script was lacking and the pacing off. Macauly Culkin said everything in the same monotonous tone to watch it you'd think he was just passing by the set and had reluctantly agreed to stand in for the real actor and read the lines off a board. The woman who played the mother was just plain irritating to the point where you wished the evil son would just get it over with already! The ending was lousy and a letdown for the partially promising tension the young actors Culkin and Wood had previously established. SPOILER no mother would ever do that! SPOILER FINISHED You're maybe wondering why I watched this movie then well one simple factor Elijah Wood. I borrowed the tape off a friend because I had heard he was on it and being a longtime fan of his I was eager to see it.

Mark Elijah Wood has just lost his mum to cancer and is sent off to his cousin Henry Macaulay Culkin to help. However Mark learns that Henry is twisted and evil whilst his mum and dad reckon he's a good boy.Although Henry is twisted and evil Culkin shows another side to him which shows that he wants attention. After killing his younger brother Richard and attempting to kill his sister I can only lead to one conclusion that Henry was once the oldest and had all the attention and became jealous when his brother and sister were born. And then Mark comes along and Henry feels threatened with his mother comforting another boy. A very different role from the Home Alone series and surprisingly brilliantly done!Elijah Wood is brilliant as Mark who feels guilty for not being able to save his mother from cancer. At the same time as grieving he has to protect Henry's sister from Henry and also try and convince Henry's parents that Henry is not as good as they like to think.What I did not like about the film is the ending to have a mother given a choice on which child should fall........ its a bit sick.Also the film was too short. It would have been interesting to actually see how Richard died and also see what made Henry become evil. That part can only be theorised it should have been put on screen!810!!!".

	schema:headline " Scratching the surface lacks depth and surprises";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie with perhaps too high expectations. It's not a bad movie but it's like a movie I would watch on a Sunday afternoon and it never get's any further than scratching the surface of it's theme a sociopathic child. Though one of the story lines focuses on what Henry has done to Richard throughout the whole movie it seems like Henry's behavior was only coming out when Mark came in to the picture. Noone seemed to have noticed anything weird about him before not even his little sister. Now a sociopath can be very manipulative and they are often charming people but one would say that his sadistic strikes would not have been totally unnoticed especially towards his sister. It's not completely unbelievable though when you see Mark as the trigger suddenly being competition for Henry as Richard was so OK the movie can get away with that.What I think was less forgiving was that the movie was all just far too predictable. Watching the mother standing where she liked to come to rest you do not need to be psychic to understand that this is the place for the final part. To me all the clues in the movie were far too obvious. It just never surprised me. An other thing is that it lacked in depth. All the elements are there but it never goes deep. It's like a bow with the potential for a good shot but the archer just doesn't pull the string back enough to give it real power. The acting was mediocre though I was pretty impressed by a young Elijah Wood. His big eyes are gorgeous and his acting compared to that of Macaulay Culkin really stood out. Elijah was the one carrying this movie and I'm glad they put him in the role of Mark and not Macaulay. Macaulay did a reasonable job especially at the beginning of the movie but like many things in The Good Son he lost his strength throughout. At the end he really did not convince me anymore. All in all I think more could have been done with the potentially interesting theme of this movie. You don't necessarily have to make a thriller out of it you could also focus on it being a drama but The Good Son tried to do both and unfortunately it failed on both sides. It wasn't scary enough it wasn't dramatic enough. I just can not give it more than a 5 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "At aged 15 I read the Movie tiein Novel by Ian McEwan and Todd Strasser before it was disappointingly banned shortly for the unrelated Jamie Bulgar case it was the Best Thriller I ever read and always delighted to read through again and again with the smiling Angelic Macaulay Culkin on the cover. Read the Book first if You can because it is very Smart. To my surprise the Movie is available but United Kingdom always has strange standards. People who claim this movie is slow are probably born after this 1993 movie because most Thrillers in the 1990's didn't have a clich horror surprises element they were steady paced. The Good Son had the atmosphere and pace of the movie Unfaithful starring Diane Lane and Richard Gere and Birth Nicole Kidman and Lauren Bacall as cast like the Golden Hollywood era of Thrillers with a modern twist. I am glad the Movie didn't have clich shocks and heart attack music or panic pulse music score all the way through because there is too much movies like that around nowadays so it is good to have variety of production. The chills are in the performance of the Actors that is how it should be isn't it?.Macaulay Culkin gave a calculating cold and analytical approach very manipulative and secretly menacing I never thought of Kevin McCallister at all. Totally different and chilling he is one scary Child. Elijah Wood his cute petrified expressions is perfect for making you see his Troubled time of his life be dealing with the recent death of his Mother and yet the Horror of being like a observing witness feeling helpless and figures how to stop his Budding Serial Killer Cousin.The self discovery of feeling an euphoria high on committing heinous acts by being able to fly. Animal torture Attempting murder carry out dark and deadly fantasies conscience doesn't bother Henry Evans Culkin all signs of a Future Serial Killer probably the worst and elusive one yet.Two Young Goodlooking Actors did carry out the movie well it is close to the book but the novel is more detailed and has more scary moments the movie is more toned down with psychological aspect of the Human nature.My advice read the book if you can get it somewhere in this Country then watch the movie. You see how accurate the characters are to the actors.As for another Evil Child Bad Seed by Patty McCormack as Rhonda Penmark. The movie is all talk and no action she behaves like a stuckUp girl that didn't get a Pony for her Birthday the mother that finds out her Daughter's secret is annoying gets shocked all the time the ending was stupid I mean completely utterly dumb that pleases the folk of 1950's. It was original to portray a Child being Evil but Bad Seed failed because it pleased the censors.So there you have it Henry Evans Wins.".

	schema:reviewBody "We all know that the character Kevin McCallister gets angry with his family twice and that he makes lives miserable for the bandits Harry and Marv. Kevin is however a good kid. This is what Kevin could be like if he was evil. Why do I say this? Because the diabolic kid of this film is portrayed by the same boy Macaulay Culkin. If Kevin was like this he would have killed his family and Harry and Marv...Ironically the movie's title refers precisely to Culkin's character instead of Elijah Wood's character who really is the good son. And why is that? Put it this way because that's the image his family and people in general have of him and because they don't know his disturbing nature.Mac shows his other side as an actor  that is his dark side. And he is excellent as Henry a child who can be described as a sociopath a psychopath a coldblooded murderer and mentally ill. Henry is also a perfect actor  he manages to keep his true nature in secret because of his angelical looks and apparent love and respect for the family and others. This is a completely different role for Mac setting it apart from the others and leaving behind his 'Home Alone' image.Mac who we are more used to see as a comedy actor with a beautiful smile here he does some extremely cold facial expressions of dark jealousy. His character Henry also displays aggressive and violent behavior as we see in some scenes.Elijah Wood is great as Mark. Here we see a younger Elijah Wood when he was a kid years before 'becoming' Frodo Baggins. Elijah was a cute kid too. Quinn Culkin is equally good as Connie and she was cute too.This film is quite short which is a good thing. But it shares the same problem of 'Mikey' we never really get to know how did Henry become so bad. We have an idea when he says It was mine before it was his refering to the rubber duck and that he became very jealous of his brother Richard and killed him but is that all? I doubt that's all.It's always shocking to see a child doing the horrible things that Henry does but this movie is considerably less violent comparing to 'Mikey'. Henry is also less dangerous than Mikey but don't get me wrong  that doesn't mean that Henry isn't dangerous  he is. It's like they say for this movie  Evil has many faces  and the headline for 'Mikey' could be applied here as well  With evil size doesn't matter.The ending is an unexpected surprise for those who watch this for the first time. Henry pays for all his crimes by being dropped off a high cliff and then we see his dead body being swept away by the sea waves.The soundtrack is entirely instrumental and consists of beautiful and soft pieces of music. Plus the sceneries of this movie are a must. We see many beautiful settings and landscapes full of snow this takes place somewhere in Winter time. Not to mention that Henry's house is lovely.Overall an okay movie but not one with enough attributes to become a classic.".

And some also say that Macaulay acted bad and didn't have more emotion witch is stupid because the only time Macaulay acted bad was when his character Henry was lying witch proves thats Macaulay was meaning to do that because not him but his character Henry was a bad actor. I mean really him and his costar Elijah wood were so talented in this movie that they over shadowed the adult acting though the adult acting is good Macaulay and Elijah are much better. I'd give this movie a 99.9100 its so good but retarted websites like rotton tomato gave this movie a 8100 witch again the only bad thing they said about it was Macaulays character I mean if it was that bad it would have gotten at least witch it didn't one Razzie award witch is an award for worst things like worst movie worst acting worst director and etc. You should see this movie its awesome!".

I'd give this movie a 99.9100 its so good but retarted websites like rotton tomato gave this movie a 8100 witch again the only bad thing they said about it was Macaulays character I mean if it was that bad it would have gotten at least witch it didn't one Razzie award witch is an award for worst things like worst movie worst acting worst director and etc. You should see this movie its awesome!";

At first Henry along with Mark do more innocent crimes... Smoking and throwing rocks through a newly built building. Those small crimes roll up into death threats killing animals and attempted murders to family. Mark tries to convince that Henry's the bad one but Henry has everyone fooled... including a therapist! Many critics of this movie rant about Macaulay's acting skills. While they werent up to Elijah Wood's skills he held his own. You have to get into the character of Henry to understand why Macaulay didnt portray Henry as having a wide variety of emotions. Henry believed he was smarter than the adults... Thats why he wasnt terrified in the end scene as Mark was.I give the movie a 910.".

Elijah Wood steals the show an accomplished actor as a character who is taken from one desperate situation his mother has just recently died and thrown into another trapped in a house with his psychotic cousin. He has more scenes than Culkin steals every scene from Culkin and is a very likable character. The same can't be said for Culkin who if anything annoys the viewer. Word has it that he only got this role because his crazy father blackmailed FOX by saying Culkin wouldn't make Home Alone 2 until he made The Good Son. Culkin does seem very outofplace and uncomfortable in some scenes letting us know that his forte is comedy not horror. A few good chilling scenes the frantic skating on the lake the cliffhanging literally finale but overall nothing to shout about.

Grant's scene by the pool with Dunne and Scott reaches a fine pitch of hilarity and who can forget the impressionistic scene of Scott's diving coming into Grant's mind and being presented in miniature onscreen? That master player of light witty material Grant is of course sublime and I was surprised by Irene Dunne  who I had never previously seen in a lead film role. She was magnificently feline as Pauline Kael says dispensing slinky fluttering phrases and quips and making it clear what a laugh the character is having she seems rather to be getting off on the entangled situation. The speech patterns are drolly created by Dunne wonderful Southern hamming or archetypal screwball dame quicktalk... Her warming gaddingabout voice is charms along with deft facial acting look at the Oh Bianca... scene at the hotel early on where she sensuously reclines on a settee and gets Grant to pretend he is entering the room and kissing his new wife. Minxish mischief of the most heartwarming kind aye...! Remarkable to think that Ms. Dunne was over forty when this was made. She has the bearing of many years younger and conveys an impressive vigour. One takes to her unconventional good looks her slight awkwardness as a 'star' is amusingly alluded to under the surface in her son's dialogue late on very poignant little moment that. Like Rosalind Russell and Kate Hepburn she is no textbook beauty and it is her characterful playing conveys a winking winning attractiveness. Why is it that we have so few similarly idiosyncratic actresses around today? All  or rather much  has to be homogenised pop star product looks are apparently required and conveyorbelted into mainstream films. Film is missing the enticing depths of reallife when it opts for the conformist teenage boy's supposed 'dream woman'  massmediafostered  over a greater variety of people and appearances as one encounters in actual reality.The actor playing the worldweary rather Robb Wiltonesquire magistrate ought to have been involved more than he was an enjoyable turn that would have been effectively woven deeper into the narrative. Randolph Scott amused slightly too in his support role a worthy foil. Things did perhaps get rather sentimental with the involvement of the couple's children although this is hardly the worst such offender in Hollywood history. The insidious wryness seems completely blunted by the end when the couple are finally reconciled. One may be charmed by the actors' performances but it all starts to seem a bit indulgent and the feeling grows that chances were missed.But really one must be indulgent critically there is priceless stuff in this film's fibre and while it fires not on all screwballcomedy cylinders it is a very pleasant feature with glorious screen presences making deceptively light of life.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the opening moments when the big wooden doors part and usher us into a beautifully spare art deco courtroom with slanting shafts of sunlight enhancing the clean architectural lines we know that this is going to be a deftlymade elegant film.  What follows does not disappoint us.Attorney Nick Arden Cary Grant lost his wife Ellen in a shipwreck in the Pacific seven years ago.  He has now decided to have her declared officially dead so that he will be free to marry Bianca Gail Patrick. The irascible judge eventually accedes to both the declaration and the marriage and the newlyweds set off for a honeymoon in Yosemite. Meanwhile who should turn up at the Arden residence very much alive but the longlost Ellen?  When she hears of the recent marriage she heads straight for the honeymooners' hotel ...My Favourite Wife is a fine example of those early Cary Grant farces the ones in which he gawps with surprise doubletakes and mutters to himself as only he can.  Irene smokegetsinyoureyes Dunn is great as Ellen unveiling a hitherto unsuspected gift for witty comedy.  Scotty Beckett and Mary Lou Harrington come close to stealing the show as the Ardens' cute little kids.  Randolph Scott is interestingly cast as Steve Burkett the musclebound Adonis who spent seven years on the desert island with Ellen.Some of the film's highlights are worth mentioning here like the superimposition of Burkett performing gymnastic feats alongside Nick Arden's troubled face as he muses at his desk conveying with economy the husband's jealous preoccupation.  It is unfair to give away a film's jokes but one gag which lose nothing in the telling is Ellen's outfit at the Yosemite hotel.  She has been out of circulation for seven years and she looks comically untrendy in her 1932 polkadots and lapels and obtrusive hat. Watch for the derisive glances from the other hotel guests.Such a light charming piece of entertainment is hard to fault but the film does have some shortcomings.  Its central problem which is not resolved is what to do with Bianca.  She married Nick in good faith and has done nothing wrong yet she is neglected by Nick.  Because there is no satisfactory way of dealing with her she is simply dropped.  Ellen's return from a watery grave after all those years would be a news story of international importance but instead she arrives home having hitched a ride in a truck.  Her entry into the country seems to have gone unannounced even to her husband.  The scene in which she persuades a shoe store clerk to pose as 'Adam' in front of Nick has enormous comic potential but is abandoned after a few seconds.  Nick's sleepingintheattic scene is far too long for the humour it contains.However the film is a pleasant and very amusing romp and such weaknesses as it contains do not detract from its appeal.".

Numerous movies have used it both for drama and for comedy and in this case the premise is adapted to the screwball comedy formula that was so popular for a time in the 1930s and 1940s.The story starts by slightly revising the usual setup with Irene Dunne as the formerly shipwrecked spouse Cary Grant as the husband who has since become involved with another woman Gail Patrick plus Randolph Scott as a wild card in the relationships. Practically every stage of the story is highly implausible probably deliberately so but amusing and it is generally left to the cast to make things work which they usually do.Grant usually seems quite at home in this kind of comedy and he and Dunne work well together depicting their characters' relationship with the kinds of intangibles that help make the whole scenario more believable. Patrick is always quite good as an elegantly icy rival to the heroine and Scott also works well here in his role. Amongst the supporting cast Granville Bates gets some very good moments as the grouchy judge.For as farfetched as the scenario seems at times it works pretty well. The cast is strong enough to carry the weight and it would have been hard to improve upon their combination of talents.

	schema:headline " A Shakespearian masterpiece of farce.";
	schema:reviewBody "Garson Kanin's best films are so bright fast and funny and have been plundered by so many pallid feelgood imitators that it's easy to overlook how courageously critical they can be of prevailing social norms for instance what society takes to be normal  'natural'  about crucial concepts like family gender marriage etc.  In 'My Favorite wife' Kanin takes the idea that a particular social order is natural and tears it apart by putting civilisation on one side nature on the other and revealing that there's nothing remotely natural about civilisation or our places in it that these things are manmade and so can be questioned negotiated even changed by man or as is more usual in Kanin's world woman.'Wife' opens with an elaborate sequence showing the structure of civilisation at work in its most intrinsic form  the legal system.  The hero is a lawyer and is trying to declare his missing first wife dead so he can marry another.  There are a few things we notice here the judge is hilarious a cantankerous old buffer testy capricious and not at all rigorous or even knowledgeable in his application of laws which after all structure people's lives and which we learn are constantly overturned by the Court of Appeals so that something that should be inviolable is shown to be provisional.  there is room for manoeuvre but there is also room for corruption.More important for Kanin's purposes are two incidental details.  The wife has been missing for seven years a fairytale or mythical number in a site of legal process undermining its claims to ultimate 'official' reality. The hero's name is Arden which might remind us of Shakespeare's Forest 'As you like it' and the spirit of play that will inform the film with people assuming and discarding roles putting on costumes using props putting on 'plays' or performances to deceive enlighten or outmanoeuvre others. On one level this warns us against accepting appearances in a civilised world that depends on appearances all the talk about respectability on another it shows that certain roles  like being a mother or husband  aren't Godgiven but roles which have to be constantly rehearsed and refined.  Play can be subversive  the way Ellen Arden dresses up as a man breaks up a marriage or tries to conceal a possible adultery  but it is also seen as a necessary process of socialisation the children learn to imitate their parents as they theatrically make their lost mother 'perform' her confession.  They learn that society is fluid not fixed they also learn to lie. the hero winds up in an Attic as in Greek comedy but that might be taking the analogy to far!Hitchcock once said that he often used Cary Grant because he wanted to work against his established image.  But the figure of masculine immaturity and insecurity so richly realised in Roger O Thornhill 'North by Northwest' is already fullyformed here in a 'hero' who jumps at any chance to avoid making difficult decisions.  Kanin like Hitchcock later makes brilliant ironic use of Grant's most famous previous roles 'Topper' another story about a professional flustered by a 'ghost' and especially 'Bringing up baby' not just in the comically ghastly leopardskin bathrobe his second wife buys him but in the animal imagery used throughout kids going to the zoo Steve as Tarzan etc. contrasting with his civilised world that is making him desperately unhappy his identity and masculine certainty fragmenting. knowledge that Grant used to live with Randolph Scott adds further comic potency to their scenes  This conflict between Nick's civilisation and the 'natural' order is typically complicated  Nick clearly married Bianca for her sexual prowess Ellen and Nick are compatible because of their intellectual superiority to everyone else which gives a streak of cruelty to their games and makes one feel genuinely sorry for BIanca.

	onyx:emotionText "Garson Kanin's best films are so bright fast and funny and have been plundered by so many pallid feelgood imitators that it's easy to overlook how courageously critical they can be of prevailing social norms for instance what society takes to be normal  'natural'  about crucial concepts like family gender marriage etc.  In 'My Favorite wife' Kanin takes the idea that a particular social order is natural and tears it apart by putting civilisation on one side nature on the other and revealing that there's nothing remotely natural about civilisation or our places in it that these things are manmade and so can be questioned negotiated even changed by man or as is more usual in Kanin's world woman.'Wife' opens with an elaborate sequence showing the structure of civilisation at work in its most intrinsic form  the legal system.  The hero is a lawyer and is trying to declare his missing first wife dead so he can marry another.  There are a few things we notice here the judge is hilarious a cantankerous old buffer testy capricious and not at all rigorous or even knowledgeable in his application of laws which after all structure people's lives and which we learn are constantly overturned by the Court of Appeals so that something that should be inviolable is shown to be provisional.  there is room for manoeuvre but there is also room for corruption.More important for Kanin's purposes are two incidental details.  The wife has been missing for seven years a fairytale or mythical number in a site of legal process undermining its claims to ultimate 'official' reality. The hero's name is Arden which might remind us of Shakespeare's Forest 'As you like it' and the spirit of play that will inform the film with people assuming and discarding roles putting on costumes using props putting on 'plays' or performances to deceive enlighten or outmanoeuvre others. On one level this warns us against accepting appearances in a civilised world that depends on appearances all the talk about respectability on another it shows that certain roles  like being a mother or husband  aren't Godgiven but roles which have to be constantly rehearsed and refined.  Play can be subversive  the way Ellen Arden dresses up as a man breaks up a marriage or tries to conceal a possible adultery  but it is also seen as a necessary process of socialisation the children learn to imitate their parents as they theatrically make their lost mother 'perform' her confession.  They learn that society is fluid not fixed they also learn to lie. the hero winds up in an Attic as in Greek comedy but that might be taking the analogy to far!Hitchcock once said that he often used Cary Grant because he wanted to work against his established image.  But the figure of masculine immaturity and insecurity so richly realised in Roger O Thornhill 'North by Northwest' is already fullyformed here in a 'hero' who jumps at any chance to avoid making difficult decisions.  Kanin like Hitchcock later makes brilliant ironic use of Grant's most famous previous roles 'Topper' another story about a professional flustered by a 'ghost' and especially 'Bringing up baby' not just in the comically ghastly leopardskin bathrobe his second wife buys him but in the animal imagery used throughout kids going to the zoo Steve as Tarzan etc. contrasting with his civilised world that is making him desperately unhappy his identity and masculine certainty fragmenting. knowledge that Grant used to live with Randolph Scott adds further comic potency to their scenes  This conflict between Nick's civilisation and the 'natural' order is typically complicated  Nick clearly married Bianca for her sexual prowess Ellen and Nick are compatible because of their intellectual superiority to everyone else which gives a streak of cruelty to their games and makes one feel genuinely sorry for BIanca.  'Wife' is a masterpiece of farce of shared rooms opening and shutting doors frustrated sexuality mixed identities  but what makes it a true classic are the flashes of whimsy  the Steve diving sequence that results in some the most bizarre incongruous and sidesplittingly funny visions ever seen on film.";

	schema:reviewBody "This romantic screwball comedy tries to recapture the zany chemistry shared between Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in The Awful Truth but the final product falls somewhat flat.Something's just missing this time around and it's a shame because the story has serious screwball potential. Dunne plays Grant's supposedly dead wife who shows up alive just after Grant has remarried. The rest of the movie is about Grant promising to tell his new wife Gail Patrick about his old one and finding ways out of it and then getting jealous when the man Randolph Scott who shared seven years with Dunne on a deserted island when they both were supposed to be dead reenters the picture and threatens to steal Dunne away. The premise is dynamite but the humour feels somewhat strained and many of the jokes fall flat. It doesn't help that Grant's character is a bit of a weenie and the new wife who we're supposed to think is a bitch but whom the film never establishes as such comes across as a victim which makes Grant's and Dunne's antics feel more mean than funny.There is a memorable conclusion though that finds Dunne in bed and Grant dressed as Santa Claus.Grade B".

Loosely based on the Alfred Lord Tennyson poem Enoch Arden Tennyson does not receive a screen credit in the finished film MY FAVORITE WIFE piles on the fastpaced snappy dialogue and outrageous comedic misunderstandings at a frantic rate. Director Garson Kanin skillfully maintains the perfect seriocomedic tone throughout the film's runtime and the picture is easily respected screenwriter's best film as a director. Interestingly enough Kanin took over the directing duties from Leo McCarey an Oscar winner as Best Director for 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH which also starred Grant and Dunne after McCarey was injured in an automobile accident McCarey also cowrote the screenplay with Kanin and Sam and Bella Spewack.The cast is marvelous topped by yet another Oscarworthy performance by Irene Dunne who offers a multidimensional portrayal in a genre where onenote characterizations typically run rampant. Dunne was indeed a rare actress who could peerlessly balance madcap humor and genuine pathos without ever appearing forced or contrived. Cary Grant is every bit Dunne's match as the befuddled husband who finds himself with one wife too many. Although his role doesn't permit him to display the jawdropping physical prowess that was showcased so remarkably in THE AWFUL TRUTH Grant's mastery of internal comedy is given ample screen time here  especially in the final twothird when he discovers he may have a romantic rival.The supporting cast is also diligently cast although there's no animal scenestealer a la canine performer Asta's memorable turn as Mr. Smith in THE AWFUL TRUTH. Platinumhaired beefcake Randolph Scott is fun as Grant's rival for Dunne's affections and the fact that Grant and Scott were lifelong friends and roommates only makes their scenes together even funnier there's also a hilarious sight gag involving the two of them that will have even the most reserved viewer rolling on the floor with laughter. The appropriately rigid Gail Patrick plays the role of the stereotypical shrew as well as anyone could and director Kanin also pulls natural performances from the two children in the cast. A comedy with a large dosage of wit and an ample amount of intelligence is quite rare and MY FAVORITE WIFE has all of that and more in abundance  it's simply a picture where everything works.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Favorite Wife 1940 is an extremely difficult film for a professional critic to evaluate as he or she knows just what a complicated and lengthy process moviemaking entails. Randolph Scott does not appear in this movie by accident or because he simply happened to be free. His relationship was so wellknown that John Farrow cleverly points it out in a short subject about horse racing that he directed in the mid1930s. Frankly I don't like Grant the man either but I particularly dislike Scott who used to be my hero  but there's nothing worse than a feeling that you've been betrayed and even worse made a sucker of! You could argue that it is quite wrong to judge actors against the standards you would apply to anyone else. You have to make an exception for actors is the general rule. Why? Why should actors be excepted? The answer to this question generally is because they are special. And why are people like Grant and Scott special? Because the army won't have anything to do with them either! Okay let's put all that feeling of uneasiness aside and just judge the movie by what we see on the screen and not by what happens after the director says Cut! In this respect  just judging the movie by what we see on the screen  we are asked to believe that a reasonably young extremely vigorous man and a healthy sexy very attractive woman lived together on a small otherwise deserted tropical island for over seven years and never once had intercourse! Come on fellas! That is surely the most ridiculous scenario I've ever heard in my life! It says much for the movie makers' skills that despite all its drawbacks the movie is still quite entertaining. This is partly due to the fine support cast particularly Granville Bates the aseptic judge and Donald MacBride the browbeaten hotel clerk.".

	onyx:emotionText "My Favorite Wife 1940 is an extremely difficult film for a professional critic to evaluate as he or she knows just what a complicated and lengthy process moviemaking entails. Randolph Scott does not appear in this movie by accident or because he simply happened to be free. His relationship was so wellknown that John Farrow cleverly points it out in a short subject about horse racing that he directed in the mid1930s. Frankly I don't like Grant the man either but I particularly dislike Scott who used to be my hero  but there's nothing worse than a feeling that you've been betrayed and even worse made a sucker of! You could argue that it is quite wrong to judge actors against the standards you would apply to anyone else. You have to make an exception for actors is the general rule. Why? Why should actors be excepted? The answer to this question generally is because they are special. And why are people like Grant and Scott special? Because the army won't have anything to do with them either!

	schema:reviewBody "My Favorite Wife is a brilliantly witty romance comedy starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant. Attorney Nick Arden Grant goes to civil court for two reasons 1. to declare his first wife Ellen Dunne whom he loved with all his heart legally dead from being shipwrecked and supposedly drowned seven years prior and 2. to get married again this time to a woman named Bianca Gail Patrick for whom he never held a high regard. Meanwhile Ellen who has NOT drowned returns home finds out about Nick's remarriage and shows up at the hotel where Nick and Bianca plan to spend their honeymoon. From then on Nick's life becomes a series of complications coverups and embarrassments which is what makes My Favorite Wife such a joyous picture to watch.Here are my favorite moments from this charming movie but please DO NOT read any further until after you have actually seen it. At the honeymoon hotel in Yosemite Nick spots Ellen for the first time just after he and Bianca enter the elevator as the door closes Nick humorously moves his body to one side as he stares at Ellen through the increasingly narrow door opening. In trying to cover up for his lengthy absence from his honeymoon suite Nick has a frantic phone conversation with Bianca in which he fumbles his words trying to make her believe he has left on a plane not realizing that Bianca is only two phone booths away from him! When Nick learns that Ellen spent seven years on a desert island with a man named Stephen Burkett Randolph Scott Nick decides to pay a visit to the Pacific Club where Burkett resides and he becomes horrified at the sight of Burkett's tall rocksolid athletic frame as he performs a gymnastic workout above the pool. The fact that this scene is accompanied by a familiar Strauss waltz makes it so much funnier! Later on Nick cannot concentrate in his law office as he sees images of Burkett's flashy performance. Back at the Pacific Club Nick catches Ellen's conscience by proving that he knows who Burkett really is the mischievous Ellen had earlier tried to fool Nick by having a very shortstatured shoe salesman played by Chester Clute pose as Burkett in order to prove to Nick that there was nothing going on between Ellen and Stephen during their sevenyear stay on the island Ellen can only react to her little failed prank by laughing hysterically at herself. A visiting psychiatrist Pedro de Cordoba spots Nick grabbing some clothes for Ellen but the doctor believes that the women's garments Nick selects are meant for a man especially when Nick tries on the clothes himself! The most heartwarming scene in this picture is that of Ellen almost in tears when she realizes that her two children Timmy Scotty Beckett and Chinch Mary Lou Harrington know that she is their mother. And finally the sight of Nick in a Santa Claus suit confirms that he and Ellen no longer need to fib to each other about their happiness in resuming their marriage together.Last but not least the casting of My Favorite Wife could not have been better. Irene Dunne was absolutely the perfect choice to play the lovable mischievous sweetnatured Ellen Wagstaff Arden who loves her husband adores her two children and is full of playful pranks. The handsome Cary Grant one of my favorite actors was a wise choice for the role of the hilariously befuddled Nick Arden. Randolph Scott was quite appropriate for the part of the tall lean muscular smiling Stephen Burkett who is not above displaying his macho side to win Ellen's heart but who also hides a large heart himself in understanding Ellen's faithfulness to Nick. And finally Gail Patrick was perfect for the role of Nick's second wife Bianca a cold sensitive highstrung woman almost devoid of personality showing virtually no affection for the two Arden children.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has sometimes occurred to me that screen comedy may have a shorter shelflife than serious drama largely because our ideas about what is comic change more quickly than do our ideas about what is tragic poignant dramatic or exciting. Certainly many comedies from the thirties and forties including some that were highly regarded when first made come across today as stale and dated. There are of course exceptions. Throughout his career Cary Grant was a fine exponent of romantic comedy and two of his others from around this period The Philadelphia Story made in the same year as My Favorite Wife and Bringing up Baby from two years earlier are among those exceptions fine vintage comedies which still keep their flavour more than sixty years later.My Favorite Wife despite having the same star is not in the same class. The film starts with Grant's character Nick Arden about to get married for the second time. The problem is that he is still married to his first wife Ellen a photographer who disappeared seven years earlier while on an expedition and has never been seen since. The problem seems to have been solved when Nick persuades a Judge to declare Ellen legally dead leaving him free to marry his new fiance Bianca. Ellen however is not dead at all and has spent the last seven years marooned on a desert island. Rescued by a passing ship she arrives back in America on the very day of Nick and Bianca's wedding. The film then explores the complications arising from this situation.One reason why the film has not lasted well is its sentimentality something that typically ages very quickly. Oscar Wilde's famous remark that a man must have a heart of stone to be able to read of the death of Little Nell without laughing was made within thirty years of Dickens's death. Grant's costar in the two other films mentioned above was of course Katharine Hepburn an actress who was always able to bring a touch of astringency to her comedies preventing them from sliding into treacly sentiment. Irene Dunne was probably regarded in her own day as an actress of similar stature to Hepburn but her performance in this film comes across as rather syrupy particularly in the scenes with her children.It might be interesting to consider how a film on this theme might be made today. I have not seen the 1960s remake Move Over Darling. It would of course be more sexually explicit in the actual film we never actually learn whether Nick's brief marriage to Bianca is ever consummated. One assumes that it is not but the strict moral codes of the forties prevented the filmmakers from being explicit on this point. We learn that Ellen was not alone on the desert island but had a companion a young man named Stephen. This causes Nick some temporary jealousy but Stephen hastens to assure everyone that nothing improper occurred between Ellen and himself during the seven years they were together. It is hard to imagine a modern film being quite so innocent.More importantly a modern remake would probably correct one of the film's weaknesses the imbalance between Nick's two wives. It is clear almost from the beginning that Ellen is his real love and that he will end up with her Bianca is a minor figure who can quite ruthlessly be pushed aside without anyone worrying. It would have been more interesting if the two had had equivalent status with the question of who would eventually win the battle to be Nick's favorite wife left in the balance until the very end. A modern film might even have had Bianca winning. There are amusing moments in this film but these generally do not arise from the interactions between the main characters Nick Ellen Stephen and Bianca. They rather involve minor characters such as the crusty and cantankerous old judge who declares Ellen dead and is then persuaded to declare her alive again or the creepy manager of the hotel where Nick and Bianca spend their honeymoon a man who continually invades his guests' privacy in his obsession with defending the respectability of his establishment. On the whole however the film does not hold up well today. If Bringing up Baby and The Philadelphia Story are fine vintage wines which have kept their flavour My Favorite Wife is a wine of similar age but from a lesser vineyard which has been kept for too long in the bottle. 510".

The performances by the human actors are very much in the wooden geewhiz style of older scifi but here it works. The ants are a silent almost invisible killer.

Of course this all ended with Star Wars Alien and E.T.  unfortunate for hardcore scifi fans. Now they're all Space Cowboys... and you know where that's at.Phase IV belongs in the previous category of thinking man's scifi  and provides plenty of atmosphere and subtle effects for the eye candy crowd. Not many explosions  but live insect actors in some of the most remarkable animal sequences seen on film. The movie also sports a Pink Floydesque sound track that complements the mood of otherworldliness during the obviously nonspeaking ant scenes. The lack of explanation of the studied ant phenomenon pulls you into the attempts at discovery by the two scientists  just what is it that they want? well what do humans want anyway? Unfortunately we never really learn more as the ending drops off with the two LEAST interesting characters supplying an uninspired ending. For me Michael Murphy as the young computer genius and Lynne Frederick as the naive spoiled brat really were miscast. Dull and Duller. Someone like Michael York would have been a better choice than Murphy who showed no intensity at all. The girl was simply too young for this role  a more mature young woman as a scientist would have added immensely to the story. However Nigel Davenport as the old aggressive and maniacal scientist is great and holds the story up until his inevitable demise. He alone makes a Formidable Foe for the Forceful Formicidae. See it if only just for the great photography.".

The idea of antagonistic armies of ants suddenly working together becomes terrifyingly real thanks to Bass' wonderful macrophotography. I remember one sequence vividly where the scientists poison the huge ant colonies with a yellow liquid. We see in great detail how a series of soldier ants sacrifice their lives to bring the liquid back to the queen so she can digest it and thereby make the next generation immune to the poison. Genius! There's always the fear that films you fondly remember don't hold up to a second viewing but it would be great to find out.

	schema:reviewBody "Saul Bass's Phase IV lies within the interstices of science fiction and horror and adds an unexpected element that of sheer awe and mystery.As a partial inspiration for his film Bass likely had the 1971 faux documentary The Hellstrom Chronicle in mind. The Hellstrom Chronicle's thesis is that insects will be the ultimate inheritors of the Earth. Bass best known as a creator of film titles most notably for many Hitchcock classics was also a great admirer of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. He even wrote a brief letter of appreciation to Kubrick that is reprinted in Jerome Agel's book The Making of 2001. Phase IV itself seems a demonic inversion of Kubrick's film offering as it does a rather different view of human destiny. Cosmic disturbances appear to have caused strange alterations in the behavior of ants. Instead of ordinary mounds enormous towers bearing massive ant colonies have been discovered in the desert. The ants have also become aggressive and are mounting nocturnal attacks upon local farmers and their livestock. In addition to a tremendous collective intelligence and purposiveness the ants seem to have developed a virulent form of venom. A pair of scientiststhe leader of whom exudes rationalist anthropocentric arroganceestablishes a laboratory in the vicinity to study the phenomenon and to put an end to it. Note SPOILER ALERT! I know Just another 1950's Bmovie retread about mutant insects thwarted in their evil plot for world domination by good oldfashioned pluck and scientific knowhow right? Wrong! The antsnormalsized by the wayare more than a match for each of man's contrivances. By using their superior social organization and intelligence and by fearless selfsacrifice the mutant ants bring the humans to their knees in short order. The film's end leaves little doubt as to man's future and eerily implies that the ants have a plan for a new Adam and Eve that is rather different from that of humanity's supposed creator. For the speciestraitor it is exhilarating to see the ants through their disciplined single mindedness triumph over the arrogant scientists. I doubt however that this theme endeared Phase IV to the moviegoing public. In fact given the film's mood ending and inadvertent demonstration of the power of quasifascistic social organization it is easy to understand why Phase IV is not better knownand why Saul Bass alas never directed another film after this one. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Phase IV is not your average movie experience.  Definitely not for everyone so see it if you get the chance Last I saw it was a 1997 airing on The SciFi Channel. and decide if it's for you.     It's even hard to generalize WHAT the movie is about.  On the surface a colony of ants has gained a heightened level of intelligence and has apparently decided to drive out the local people.  A group of surviving scientists who were examining the ant phenomenon rescue a wandering woman and they become trapped in the laboratory.  The lead researcher then goes nutters over trying to determine what the ants are doing and getting nowhere because well ants and humans just aren't natural conversationalists.  And the story ends... well it just ends.  What did the ants want?  Did they take over the woman's body at the end?  Did they the one surviving scientist or did he join them just come to reason with them what?  Plus what ARE the other three Phases?     Now I first saw this film on Beta in 1985 and on VHS many time since the last being the aforementioned 1997 airing.  I've read the reviews here and WHERE are people getting the alien intelligence taking over the ants from?!  I've been watching this movie for 15 plus years and I can't recall any aliens mentioned.  An alien influence on the ants WOULD make a bit more sensical motivation for the ants but I don't recall this stated even as a theory anywhere in the movie.  I welcome anyone to email me and let me know where it is in the film because I may have just failed to catch it.     So why would I recommend it?  This movie manages to effectively pull you into the story without any of the excess baggage one would expect from a nature gets its revenge picture.  No drawn out battle sequences like Empire Of The Ants.  The event has happened so there's no need to express it with cheap special effects.  The story hinges instead on the aftermath how people deal with it the scientific community's response all the time presenting a prevailing air of mystery as to why the ants did it. The casual viewer will be disappointed by its rather quizzical ending because it doesn't resolve the question of what the ants want or were doing in a clean cut package.  In fact it doesn't GIVE an answer.  It opens up the floor to debate so to speak where your own questions about it allow you to formulate your own message from the ending.  Can we live with the ants?  Can the ants live with us?  Do either sides want to?      Many would also find this film boring because of the lack of action sequences until the end pretty much summed up when the nutter scientist is consumed in a pit of ants.  Instead the film builds up suspense with effective small shots of the ants themselves.  Ants moving through technical equipment to sabotage it.  Ants moving through their tunnels reflecting a genuine sinister sense a sort of What are they planning if anything? atmosphere.  Ants moving over furniture people.  Nothing over done with an army of ants crawling all over the place people screaming as they drown in a flood of insects Save the one scientist I suppose.  It doesn't dumb itself down with exploitive action sequences.     In the end the film doesn't insult a viewer's intelligence.  IF someone doesn't get anything out of about it the film just lets them be. For others it opens up the floor with unresolved questions but does not hinge on them like so many cop out endings.  You're left to reach your own conclusions but not as a crutch to avoid having to write an ending or a low budget etc.     An interesting film if you can ever find it.  If you do watch it and decide for yourself.  It's one of the few movies made that lets you choose whether to like it or not and goes along with that.".

	schema:reviewBody "When one hears of a scifi film about the massing of hyperintelligent ants one immediately constructs a mental imagine of something akin to Them! 1954 with its ridiculous though iconic monster ants barely functioning well enough to move. However Phase IV is an entirely different movieand ant for that matter. Phase IV is nothing short of a scifi film for the thinking man. While being fully aware of the genre's motifs its cinematic approach is that of the arthouse  a 70s psychedelic scifi trip shrouded in hordes of ants directed by the famous Academy Award winning graphic designer Saul Bass. For all this its status in film history is nothing but a tragedy. It's the only feature film directed by Bass and it's almost completely forgotten and certainly isn't readily available for viewing.The story is fairly simple some undefined cosmic event occurs and augments ant evolution. This particular desert colony ascends to an intelligent collective consciousness making the ants capable of communication and great terror. The colony per its aggressive expansion drives out the local human population. A scientific lab is established with our main scientist protagonists. The proceedings eventually lead to a division between the two scientists and some inevitable chaos.The brilliance of this film is the visual component. The cinematography by Dick Bush not kidding is in line with the best of the 70s. Furthermore there are also a lot of interestingly beautiful shots of the colony and ant behavior. Straight away at the start of the film we are presented some truly striking images of the ant intelligence movement for several minutes  no dialog no humans just cinematic language.In short one could say If you're the type of person annoyed by a Space Odyssey or even Blade Runner then you're the type of person that shouldn't watch Phase IV. However if you're a total film buff andor scifi nerd I highly recommend you seek out this hard to find underrated masterpiece  you will not regret it.Review from Beguiled httpbrianbeguiled.blogspot.com".

There is no science fiction movie out there quite like it. Saul Bass is a great credits maker and an even better director. The lead actor whose name I seem to have forgotten at the moment...Michael something... is a great choice and the rest of the cast which is very small turn out fine performances as well. This movie proves that you don't need a huge cast to have a good thought provoking movie.

Bass' genius is usually confined to the miniature. What better way to explore this than extensive ant photography. I could not believe the character injected into what in the hands of some hack director might be just nature shots. The film begins media res and there is a sense that the world is off kilter somehow. The voice over that caps the movie is some of the most literate enigmatic film monologue i have experienced. See this as a parent of PI and you'll be on the right track. the sun bleached photography and the atmosphere of menace conspire to such a degree that the movie has the feeling of a Beach Boys nightmare.I will not spoil the ending. It is enough to say that there may very well never be anything like it again. Bass directed a short called Quest produced by Robert Redford probably shot in Utah! which has the same vibe. It is like the invasion of some other reality into our own. 1010. This movie made me want to explode.".

I could not believe the character injected into what in the hands of some hack director might be just nature shots. The film begins media res and there is a sense that the world is off kilter somehow. The voice over that caps the movie is some of the most literate enigmatic film monologue i have experienced. See this as a parent of PI and you'll be on the right track. the sun bleached photography and the atmosphere of menace conspire to such a degree that the movie has the feeling of a Beach Boys nightmare.I will not spoil the ending. It is enough to say that there may very well never be anything like it again. Bass directed a short called Quest produced by Robert Redford probably shot in Utah! which has the same vibe. It is like the invasion of some other reality into our own. 1010. This movie made me want to explode.";

	schema:reviewBody "NINOTCHKA tells the story of a female special envoy from Russia Greta Garbo sent to Paris to investigate the rather unorthodox and generally inefficient way in which three Russian ambassadors Iranoff Buljanoff and Kopalskithe trio serve as an excuse for much slapstick hilarity in the film are carrying out their job. They're supposed to be selling jewels belonging to the former Grand Duchess Swana Ina Claire but instead get distracted by the luxuries of capitalist society as gleefully pressed onto them by the Count d'Algout Leon Melvyn Douglas. It doesn't take long for the dour humourless Ninotchka to fall hard for the charming Leon and their love story begins atop the Eiffel Tower in Paris. We gather however that Leon and the exDuchess share a casual onoff relationship and Swana handily uses Nina's deep love for her mother Russia to blackmail the latter into returning to Russia without a word to Leon. So what happens when the Russian customs official refuses to give Leon a visa into Russia? You'll have to watch for yourself to discover the whimsical delightful ending.All in all NINOTCHKA is a fine funny film with romance spilling out of its seams. From the first dry crisp conversation between Leon and his Ninotchka while they wait for a whistlebreak in Parisian traffic you become involved with the characters and their love as he tries to break down her icy defenses as he keeps trying in the face of her many rebuffs. One standout scene would be that of the drunken interlude in Nina's Royal Suite as the couple look quizzically at the necklace that would bring them together and separate them and Leon crowns his girlfriend before laying her gently on the bed kissing her goodnight and taking his gentlemanly leave. It's also hard to beat the scene in which as the tagline proudly declares 'Garbo Laughs!' as Leon tries to coax a laugh out of Nina and only succeeds by falling over backwards in his chair. The romantic comedy is certainly strong and sweet but there's plenty of other comedy available as well largely thanks to the three Russian sidekick ambassadors charmed by the benefits of capitalism. It's great fun watching them flounder helplessly when they first meet their stern unforgiving Comrade Yakushova but warm up to her when they return to Russia and have an omelette dinner together.There is no doubt that Greta Garbo turns in a great performance as the title character. She plays the ice queen very convincingly with the appropriate suggestion that her lips haven't seen a smile in a decade or so. If you're worried her Russian accent is also perfectly credible though at times she lapses into something somewhat less than Russian. When she finally breaks into laughter the transition is believable as is the sunny change that thereafter infuses Nina as she becomes Leon's Ninotchka. It's an especially nice touch to have her unable to suppress a wave of laughter in the first official meetingit's also hilarious when she suddenly generously gives her three colleagues fifty francs because they're out of money... only to qualify that by asking them to bring her back 45 francs! I think it is to Garbo's credit that she can pull off both the dour passionless Comrade Yakushova and the almost shy giggling Ninotchka with equal aplomb. Her frequent question Can I make a speech? when drunk on champagne isI think the only word for it isadorable. That face of hers so famous around the world really is made for the cameras and I think Lubitsch captured it beautifully. Lubitsch also directs with the lightest of touches allowing his cast full rein. Melvyn Douglas looks absolutely no different from his role a decade later in MR BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE but there is no doubting that this is Garbo's film.This is a sweet happy film about love overcoming ideology nationality and geography and one that doesn't feel the need to beat us over the head with it. The relationship is welldeveloped the characters interesting and the execution topnotch. For me personally the film lacks something that would render it a 1010 classic but that certainly isn't indicative of its quality as a romantic comedy. A great way to spend an evening. 810.".

	schema:headline " Why Didn't Garbo Make More Comedies?";
	schema:reviewBody "I see that Billy Wilder collaborated on this. Was it a studio decision that Garbo wasn't cast as a comedienne? From the evidence in this film she should have been. Her timing is excellent her delivery very special. This is a gem I'd never seen that deserves its National Registry status. In 1939 the Soviet Union had sympathizers in the US and during the coming World War it was an ally. This gentle spoof of Soviet seriousness and selfconscious worker ethics foreshadows the arguments that were later trotted out after the War to begin the Cold War but here the humor and satire are soft more Noel Coward than propaganda.My lament is not seeing more comedy from Garbo. She made such serious and tragic films when she could have been making us laugh. The film is dated yes but Garbo herself shines through along with her three Russian accomplices. I think that Billy Wilder and Garbo would have been a great team".

	schema:headline " NINOTCHKA Still Defies Her Critics";
	schema:reviewBody "An expertlyplayed and presented comedy that continues to be dogged by detractors for the oddest reasons. Some feel NINOTCHKA suffers compared to Lubitsch's earlier work finding it formulaic alongside 1933's TROUBLE IN PARADISE. I hadn't known Lubitsch had been given 'dowhatthouwilt' privileges from the Hays Office  I'd labored under the delusion he faced the same restrictions in content and tone every other moviemaker did in 1939. Other naysayers decry the film's jabs at Soviet collectivism as 'dated' if not 'unenlightened'. Huh? You mean show trials and forced starvation of kulaks were GOOD things that a truly witty screenplay would celebrate? Still other kibitzers squawk over the casting of all things! While it IS fun to picture William Powell or Robert Montgomery in the role of Leon the boulevardier Melvyn Douglas was never better than he is here. If he has his spotty moments it's in those scenes where he must swoon with ardor reciting dialogue that rings a tad purple to the ear it's quite possible Powell or Montgomery would have fared even worse reading those lines. Okay enough defense  now let's go to NINOTCHKA's numerous strengths. Garbo is magnificent she has a real knack for comedy her deadpan entrance is hilarious yet as always is able to break your heart with a look a word a gesture. Her three 'stooges' Sig Rumann Alexander Granach  Felix Bressart are broadly funny and genuinely endearing. Ina Claire is everything her legend always claimed she was  though her character is icily calculating you can't hate any woman who can make dialogue bristle like this. Lubitsch is in complete command throughout his staging and pacing of the proceedings masterful in its seeming effortlessness. Even the storied Metro glitz shines in NINOTCHKA right down to the brilliant artifice of Cedric Gibbons' art direction the Eiffel Tower sets especially. Last but not least is the superb screenplay by among other hands the team of Charles Brackett  Billy Wilder. Wisely their satiric darts are dipped in a curare leavened by wit and sentiment and while they are thrown with accuracy their sting is never such that the satire sinks into the mire of political ideology. NINOTCHKA after all is about the triumph of love over politics and to those who feel trapped in the prevailing toiletethic of the Farrelly Brothers' bloodpoisoning of modern comedy represents a muchneeded antidote. Inoculate yourself at your earliest opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "While it's a given that Greta Garbo was the most enigmatic of film stars during Hollywood's golden age it's also fair to state that she may be the least relevant today for her austere beauty and cool sometimes unapproachable demeanor. Yet all that is erased with this 1939 comedy masterwork which brilliantly teams her with the master of innuendofilled scintillation Ernst Lubitsch. With a lasersharp witty script by Walter Reisch Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder before he became a master director himself this classic is one part political comedy one part screwball farce and one part romantic whimsy all blended impeccably with the famous Lubitsch touch.The plot involves Nina Ivanovna Yakushova a Soviet envoy sent to Paris to ensure that the government receives the proceeds from the sale of jewels once owned and still coveted by the Grand Duchess Swana now an expatriate. The cold emotionless envoy goes about superseding the three lesser envoys who have been assimilating themselves into the frivolous capitalistic world of Paris thanks to Count Leon a tuxedoed dandy and the duchess's constant escort. It is Leon who dubs the envoy Ninotchka and after initial resistance the two find themselves falling in love but not at the expense of her convictions about the omnipotence of Communist values. The jewels become a negotiation ploy that complicates their affair as does the Grand Duchess herself. The plot develops in unexpected ways and through such clever observational humor that the ending comes all too soon.While she is deified by many for the operatic tragedy of Camille and the mannered mystique of Mata Hari Garbo seems at first to be a parody of her sullen screen image with witty oneliners delivered in hilarious deadpan but she like her character blossoms into a warm comically romantic presence as the film progresses. It's a wondrous transformation and the one performance that assures Garbo her lasting stature more than any other. As Leon Melvyn Douglas specialized in William Powellknockoff roles like this one and while he does get a bit excessive in his 1930'sstyle romantic gestures he is sophisticated and genial enough to have us believe Ninotchka may give up Mother Russia for him.At first stage legend Ina Claire seems like she will play the Grand Duchess Swana as a dotty ninny but when her talons show she is an excellent match for Garbo in their scenes together. As the trio of envoys ensconced in the good life Sig Ruman Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach make a merry chorus to the proceedings. I particularly like the scenes back in Russia when they share an omelet dinner with Ninotchka in her Sovietsanctioned multipleoccupant room. The print transfer on the 2005 DVD is pristine and brings out William Daniels' sparkling blackandwhite cinematography though the only extra is the film's original trailer. This is truly a mustsee.".

	schema:headline " The Problems of Capitalism v. Communism solved by Parisian Champagne";
	schema:reviewBody "If any film is chosen by most people as the typical Ernst Lubtisch comedy it is NINOTCHKA. TROUBLE IN PARADISE is usually pointed at as his best comedy and his best musical comedy is THE MERRY WIDOW with Chevalier and MacDonald but NINOTCHKA is the elegant comedy of some point that people recall. I think the real reason is that it is for most people the best known of Greta Garbo's movies after all she laughed in it and it does dismiss Communism with such sweet aplomb.Actually it does not do so that well. It shows that given an opportunity to relax and speak one's mind and not worry about informers and gulags people will be happier. That is true but one could also say as Lubitsch would show in TO BE OR NOT TO BE that a form of extreme capitalism mixed with racist ideals called Nazism could be just as deadly. Moreover Leon Melvin Douglas does read up a bit on Marx and his theories and has an interesting conversation with his elderly valet Richard Carle. Douglas feels that Carle has been oppressed over the years as a servant. Carle though reminds him that while he does not mind that Douglas has not paid him in quite a while the thought that in a Communist world he Carle would have to share his money with Douglas frightens the hell out of him.Douglas is the lover of Grand Duchess Swanna Ina Claire whose property was appropriated by the Soviet Government in the Revolution. Her jewelry is now in Paris in the hands of a trade mission led by Sig Ruman Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach. They plan to use it to get needed farm equipment for the Soviet Union. Douglas goes to work to corrupt the three men which is not too difficult so he can try to get his hands on the jewels for Swanna. But the Russians send an additional member to head the mission Garbo as Ninotchka. She is quite hard nosed and business like. Ruman and company try to get her to understand what is going on is a good thing but she keeps reminding what they are there for. She is not impressed that she is in the City of Lights. Instead on her first afternoon in Paris she is determined to see the city's power plant! Douglas sees her and is instantly charmed but she keeps resisting his efforts. Her background is quite different from what he is used to  we learn for instance that she actually distinguished herself in the Russo  Polish war of 1920  21 getting wounded but killing the Polish soldier who wounded her and comforting him as he died. She is not without a heart but she is determined to do her duty. What finally breaks her down is not Douglas' attempts at romance but his making a fool of himself trying to tell her a joke.She does break down but she never loses sight of the reason for her mission. And she and Swanna finally reveal their willingness to sacrifice in a showdown scene where the Grand Duchess gives up the jewels for Leon while Ninotchka gives up Leon for the needs of her country.Leon too grows determined to try to bring her back. The scene between Douglas and George Tobias is one of the funniest in the movie as Douglas desperately offers to return to Soviet Russia and Tobias knowing what people like Douglas think of the Soviet regime refuses to give him a visa he might try to blow up a dam!.How he succeeds in the end I will leave to the viewer to find out. My only other comment is that this film is also recalled as the only time Greta Garbo shared a scene with Bela Lugosi as her supervisor Commissar Razinin. It is only a three minute scene and has only one funny line for Bela describing the antics of Ninotchka's old mission buddies. He seemed stern and properly in control of his job but he was far more funny in INTERNATIONAL HOUSE.Please also note Sig Ruman's comment to Garbo asking her if she wanted to be alone. It is an interesting little reference to her most famous line of dialog from GRAND HOTEL six years before.".

Carle though reminds him that while he does not mind that Douglas has not paid him in quite a while the thought that in a Communist world he Carle would have to share his money with Douglas frightens the hell out of him.Douglas is the lover of Grand Duchess Swanna Ina Claire whose property was appropriated by the Soviet Government in the Revolution. Her jewelry is now in Paris in the hands of a trade mission led by Sig Ruman Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach. They plan to use it to get needed farm equipment for the Soviet Union. Douglas goes to work to corrupt the three men which is not too difficult so he can try to get his hands on the jewels for Swanna. But the Russians send an additional member to head the mission Garbo as Ninotchka. She is quite hard nosed and business like. Ruman and company try to get her to understand what is going on is a good thing but she keeps reminding what they are there for. She is not impressed that she is in the City of Lights. Instead on her first afternoon in Paris she is determined to see the city's power plant! Douglas sees her and is instantly charmed but she keeps resisting his efforts. Her background is quite different from what he is used to  we learn for instance that she actually distinguished herself in the Russo  Polish war of 1920  21 getting wounded but killing the Polish soldier who wounded her and comforting him as he died. She is not without a heart but she is determined to do her duty. What finally breaks her down is not Douglas' attempts at romance but his making a fool of himself trying to tell her a joke.She does break down but she never loses sight of the reason for her mission. And she and Swanna finally reveal their willingness to sacrifice in a showdown scene where the Grand Duchess gives up the jewels for Leon while Ninotchka gives up Leon for the needs of her country.Leon too grows determined to try to bring her back. The scene between Douglas and George Tobias is one of the funniest in the movie as Douglas desperately offers to return to Soviet Russia and Tobias knowing what people like Douglas think of the Soviet regime refuses to give him a visa he might try to blow up a dam!.How he succeeds in the end I will leave to the viewer to find out. My only other comment is that this film is also recalled as the only time Greta Garbo shared a scene with Bela Lugosi as her supervisor Commissar Razinin. It is only a three minute scene and has only one funny line for Bela describing the antics of Ninotchka's old mission buddies. He seemed stern and properly in control of his job but he was far more funny in INTERNATIONAL HOUSE.Please also note Sig Ruman's comment to Garbo asking her if she wanted to be alone. It is an interesting little reference to her most famous line of dialog from GRAND HOTEL six years before.";

Who would have thought that Melvyn Douglas could be a romantic and Greta Garbo a comedienne.

Ninotchka and her associates are true Soviet believers and the exiled Grand Duchess Swana is somebody you would just love to see a meteorite fall upon. Of course the film does make references to the Russian shortages marching and spies planted among the Russian everyman but it does so in a comical way. For sure Lubitsch could not have made this film in the atmosphere of ten years later because of all of the Communist paranoia in the United States.

	schema:reviewBody "For having a rather odd combination of elements Ninotchka works better than you would expect. It would be well worth seeing solely for the chance to see Greta Garbo in a comedy and she herself comes off very well. The story is light but entertaining and it is mostly enjoyable in itself while also providing an interesting look at contemporary attitudes towards the USSR.Garbo shows that she can handle the light comedy well and although her character's transformation is somewhat stylized this seems to be deliberate rendering moot the otherwise obvious questions of believability. Melvyn Douglas makes an unusual pairing for Garbo and he only partially works. His style can often become overly ingratiating and while there are movies where that style fits in well it is less than ideal here. A different choice for the role might have changed the feel of the movie for the better.Garbo's three Soviet comrades are possibly the best part of the picture. Felix Bressart and Sig Rumann in particular are impossible to forget. The roles are wellwritten and are used well in the story. Bela Lugosi is also in the supporting cast but unfortunately he does not get a lot to do. The implied commentary on the nature of the then fairly young USSR is of some interest in itself in comparison with the later attitudes of the postwar era.Overall while Ninotchka has some uneven stretches it is quite an enjoyable and interesting film that generally succeeds with its offbeat mix of cast and material.".

	schema:headline " Classic prewar comedyromance is packed with satire and laughter";
	schema:reviewBody "Ninotchka is one of the funniest movies ever made. But it's not a slapstick or screwball comedy. It is in the class of It Happened One Night My Man Godfry and Holiday. The humor is in snappy dialog. The oneliners subtle zingers and satire poke fun mostly at Soviet Russia and communism. But it has occasional jabs at capitalism and western lifestyles  notably the idle rich. The movie is superb in all aspects especially in the script direction settings and acting. All of the cast give top performances. Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas are the perfect match for some of the funniest repartee ever put on film. But how Garbo Ninotchka could keep a straight face in those exchanges one after another is beyond me. I'll bet MGM had to do many retakes of some of her scenes. If not for her breaking down then for the cracking up of Douglas Leon or others on the set and behind the camera. Ninotchka is one of the great comedyromances for the ages. Young and old alike can enjoy it. But from some of the comments I've read it seems much of the humor is lost without a little knowledge of the time. So I offer these tidbits to help set the stage and prepare viewers for a most enjoyable film. The time is the late 1930s. The story takes place mostly in Paris moves to Moscow later and ends in Istanbul. In 1939 all the world knows about Soviet Russia and many of its problems. It has been in the news since the communist takeover after the revolutions 20 years earlier. Joseph Stalin's fiveyear plan for recovery since 1922 was past its 15th year. So far it had been an abysmal failure. His social programs had disrupted total populations. His collectivist farm program had failed miserably. Combined with drought and famine the Russian people faced starvation.But that's not all. The Great Purge of 193638 had been in the news the past couple of years. It was Stalin's way to get rid of anyone who didn't agree with him or who might challenge his oppressive rule of Russia. The purge eradicated half a million Russian leaders. The press had covered the carefully staged mock trials in Moscow in that time. Many Russian communist and social leaders confessed to being traitors before they were sentenced to death or the gulags in Siberia. As all of that was going on and being reported from Russia a number of former Czarist Russian royalty were living in exile around Europe especially in Paris. Many stories and jokes circulated at that time about crown jewels and lost titles. Thus the stage is set for Ninotchka. With the large number of reviews posted up to this time I wouldn't normally add my own. But I think far too many people have missed the true depth of the satire and comedy in this great film. The IMDb Web site has a long list of witty dialog and exchanges from the film. But there are many more  and some real subtle zingers that I think many people miss. Here are a few to whet your appetite. In an early scene Ninotchka explains why Soviet Russia is peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time. She says Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there'll not be enough bread for our people and you comrades. What a great example of skewered Soviet thinking. As if tractors could overcome a drought and famine. It's a great jab at the Soviets.Here's another one. Garbo looks over her hotel suite and says I'm ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this. And another when her cohorts take her to the suite they reserved for her. Which part of the room is mine? Garbo asks. And a cohort replies You see comrade it's a little different here. They don't rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite. One more sidesplitter was when her agents asked How are things in Moscow? Garbo replied Very good. The last mass trial was a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians. A direct jab at Stalin's Great Purge. Douglas meeting with the three agents early in the film says that the jewels owned by the exiled duchess were confiscated by the Soviets. One of the agents quips I give you my word they were confiscated legally. In a caf later a waiter seats Ninotchka and asks Now what shall it be? She says Raw beets and carrots. He replies Madame this is a restaurant not a meadow. She next says Bring me something simple  I never think about food. The waiter asks If you don't think about food what do you think about? Ninotchka answers The future of the common people. And the waiter replies That's also a question of food. What a great running dialog!Ninotchka was nominated for four Academy Awards including Garbo for best actress and the film as best picture. That year may have been the best year in motion picture history for the number of great films produced. But for that Ninotchka likely would have won two or more Oscars. More than 40 full length movies competed for 1939 Oscar honors. Among the best of the year were Gone With the Wind Stagecoach Goodbye Mr. Chips Mr. Smith Goes to Washington The Wizard of Oz Ninotchka Wuthering Heights Dark Victory Beau Geste Of Mice and Men Young Mr. Lincoln Gunga Din The Four Feathers Only Angels Have Wings and Bachelor Mother. Those top 15 films have a combined average viewer rating on September 20 2012 of 7.8. Has there been another year of more great movies than that?".

What she doesn't count on is meeting and falling for the smooth spectacularly elegant Count Leon D'Algout a lawyer for the Grand Duchess who falls head over heels in love with Ninotchka and slowly warms her cold heart.Simply put this is a perfect and charming story. It moves along smoothly and effectively and it never makes a wrong turn. What may be most interesting about it is the amount of facts and information the screenwriters injected into the story. Today any historical account of a past time would for the most part avoid discussing what actually happened and just stick to the present. Here the film was released just as World War II was beginning and the Soviet Union was quickly becoming a major player in world affairs. There are large monologues where the characters are discussing the beliefs of the communistic society compared to a capitalistic society. Ernst Lubitsch directs with his usual wit and flair while also poking fun at serious subjects at the time. Garbo gives perhaps her finest performance and Melvyn Douglas has never been more suave. A true masterpiece of the Golden Age Ninotchka is not to be missed by anyone who loves the movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those were the days my friends back in 1939 when Hollywood made the comedies that were funny classy and sparkling. Ernst Lubitsch directed the screen legend the dramatic star Greta Garbo in her first and the best remembered comedy NINOTCHKA. In the title role Garbo plays a Soviet envoy sent to Paris to check up on the lack of progress in a sale of the jewels that used to belong to the Grand Duchess Swana the relative of the last Russian Tsar who now lives in exile in Paris. Initially a fanatical Bolshevik and the Ice Queen who never smiles as the movie progresses Comrade Ninotchka falls in love with Swana's good friend playboy Leon d'Algout  Melvyn Douglas who tries to interfere with a sale. The first half of the film is among the funniest I've seen. The dialogs and remarks by Billy Wilder are simply sparkling Ninotchka We don't have men like you in my country. Leon Thank you. Ninotchka That is why I believe in the future of my country. Count Leon D'Algout Do you like me just a little bit? Ninotchka Your general appearance is not distasteful. Ninotchka Don't make an issue of my womanhood. Ninotchka The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians. When Ninotchka began to thaw it became a little silly for my taste but the Moscow episodes the omeletdinner scene at Ninotchka's overcrowded apartment and her conversation with Bela Lugosi's Commissar Razinin and the end were perfect again. Overall if anyone had to make a funny and classy comedy making fun of the Russian Politics and fanatic Bolsheviks Lubitch Wilder and Garbo were the perfect artists for the task.910".

For this reason and for the fact that it is the fabled film where Garbo laughs the film is remembered.Alexander Granach Sig Ruman and Felix Bressart are three of Marshal Stalin's officials entrusted with selling some jewelry belonging to some former Russian royalty. But they linger too long in Paris sampling a lot of the good living they can't get back in the worker's paradise. Due to their sloth the real owner of the jewels exiled Russian countess Ina Claire discovers they are in Paris. She dispatches her boyfriend and apparently doubling as a lawyer Melvyn Douglas to serve them with a restraining order to prevent their sale.Counting on the fortune these gems would bring another Soviet envoy is sent Greta Garbo who is quite a bit more business like than our previous troika. But unfortunately she meets up with the ever so charming Melvyn Douglas even before she realizes he's her adversary. It's too late though Douglas's charm and Paris's enchantment have Garbo hooked.The publicity surrounding Ninotchka advertised the film as 'Garbo laughs'. She not only laughs but she does one mean drunk act besides as she forgets to tend to business at some critical moments.Ernest Lubitsch directed Greta Garbo to her final Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Unfortunately Garbo was up in the year of Gone With the Wind and she lost to Vivien Leigh. Ninotchka was also up for Best Picture Best Original Story and Best Screenplay and could not break the Gone With The Wind hammerlock on Mr. Oscar that year.The screenplay was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder savored and saved some of his best barbs for his own film about the Cold War One Two Three in 1961. Run them side by side one night and you'll see what I'm talking about.Garbo got the Oscar nomination and Melvyn Douglas was lauded for his portrayal of the charming French count who lures Garbo away from Communism and her duty. However I'd like to put a word in for Ina Claire who plays the countess. The woman whose world was lost in a terrible bloodbath and who was brought up in luxury has a lot more steel in her makeup than we originally think. My favorite scene is her with Garbo where she plays one mean game of hardball in negotiating for her jewels. Ninotchka might well have been her finest screen moment.The Soviet experiment is now history but Ninotchka the film remains a classic view of the west about that system and one charming romantic comedy with that famous Lubitsch elegant touch.".

Not only are the three comrades sent to perform the sale seduced by the luxuries they find but in the process their socialist ideology is quickly changed into becoming capitalists.When Ninotchka a no nonsense woman is sent to oversee the work of the comrades she is appalled because of the decadence she finds! Ninotchka is after all a woman so she cannot resist looking at a beautiful made hat or enjoy the feel of silk underwear she had never worn in her life. Leon who has been involved with Swana the exiled Russian aristocrat is enlisted to help her deal with Ninotchka who represents the people that stole the family jewels and now are trying to dispose of them to anyone that can buy them. Leon is eager to please he goes along in a game of his own trying to win Ninotchka who at first resists his advances. But all is lost because the Russian woman ends up falling head over heel for the dashing Leon. Her transformation begins at this point. If there were things to make the hardest communist to waver the taste of freedom and luxury prove to be intoxicating for Ninotchka.This was one of the best comedies that came out of Hollywood in 1939. Ernst Lubitsch did wonders in bringing Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett screenplay and turned it into a delightful film that has stayed as fresh as when it first was released. Of course today audiences might react different because life in Russia is not what it was during the period that is presented in the film.Greta Garbo was a great as Ninotchka. She made a career in Hollywood playing dramatic parts but she was amazing as a comedienne. Her timing was impeccable as she clearly shows an uncanny talent for comedy. She was perfectly matched by Melvin Douglas another excellent actor. Mr. Douglas is a joy to watch playing against the straight faced Garbo.

She is dazzling and has perfect comic delivery both in her stern and rigid and romantic stages. However Melvyn Douglas is also notable as the Count Leon d'Algout and the chemistry developed between the two is perfect. The supporting performances are also memorable particularly from the three Russian men that are initially in the film's spotlight.The humor in this film is consistently excellent and has two dimensions to it. First it is funny as a romantic comedy. However secondly it is also funny as a critique of the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union a prime example being when Ninotchka comments that there will be fewer but better Russians after mass trials. Lastly one other part that deserves note is an amusing effect in the film to show a change in a picture of Lenin.

The dialog from Melvin Douglas and Ina Claire really date the film. Douglas as he was in a lot of movies I've seen with him is not a likable guy. He can be very annoying but some of that is because he's doing such a fine acting job.Ninotchka develops into a nice romance story in the second half of the movie with a short satisfying ending and a pointed comment about living in Russia at that time as opposed to a free country.

However Christian soon gains a fast companion with the German Dr. Johann Struensee a quietly idealistic man of the Enlightenment. As the only one who can influence the King Struensee is able to begin sweeping enlightened reforms of Denmark through Christian even as Caroline falls for the doctor. However their secret affair proves a tragic mistake that their conservative enemies use to their advantage in a conflict that threatens to claim more than just the lovers as their victims.";

	schema:headline " More than a history lesson";
	schema:reviewBody "You could dismiss this film as a Danish history lesson but it is more than that. It is a love story with an improbable background in a rather gloomy setting the Danish Court of the late 18th century. Mad or at least seriously disturbed King Christian VII Mikkel Folsgaard  superbe marries 16 year old English princess Caroline Alicia Vikander who happens to be George III's sister. He prefers the company of his dog and mistress to her. It is not surprising that Caroline falls for Johann Struensee Mads Mikkelsen who becomes the king's personal physician on the strength of his knowledge of Shakespeare especially Hamlet. The king is as they say easily led and for a year or so Sturensee despite being German has a fine time as de facto ruler enacting liberal measures such as the abolition of serfdom and the repeal of censorship laws not to mention free smallpox inoculations. But the forces of reaction led by the king's stepmother gather. It was surprising to learn that 18th century Denmark was such a backward society.Mads Mikkelsen gives a nuanced performance  'quiet intensity' in fact and Alicia Vikander is equally intense. They are a serious couple imbued with the ideals of the 18th century Enlightenment but their passion is physical as well as intellectual. Unfortunately their ideals are a little advanced for Denmark of the 1770s despite support from writers such as Voltaire. The local bookburners led by HoeghGuldberg David Dencik are not swayed by argument of course.The production is full of atmosphere. The castles are suitably gloomy and there's plenty of medieval squalor beyond the castle gate. Much of the action takes place in winter which adds to the chilly atmosphere. The aristocracy are suitably heartless and the peasants downtrodden. The king provides some zany if not quite authentic moments appointing his Great Dane to his council and ordering Struensee to make Caroline a fun queen.This is quite a long movie at 140 minutes yet is enthralling from start to finish. Even though you can guess the ending you are swept along by the story and the performances. You can see why the audiences at Cannes loved it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the great fortune to be invited to attend the World Premiere at the Berlin Film Festival earlier this evening of this wonderful film and opportunities like that don't come often. A Royal Affair is Oscar level material in many respects. The screenplay directing and photography are all superb but the performance of Mikkel Flsgaard as Christian VII of Denmark was perfection. It is so difficult to act a madman acting as if he were sane and I cannot believe any actor taking an Oscar this year could have put up a better performance. Mikkel got the loudest cheer from the audience and he thoroughly deserved it. The plot revolves around the machinations of power behind the throne of a simpleton monarch. Christian may be King but he simply wants to play like a child. He is married and fathers a son quite brutally but he loves his dog more than his family. And so a German Doctor is called to treat him. Christian befriends his physician and leaves more and more power in the hands of this foreign commoner. And then the Doctor falls in love with the Queen.... It's all true and I won't tell more than that. Just go and see it as soon as you can. It puts Hollywood and Bollywood both straight into the dust bin. Classic drama brilliant script and a piece of thespianism that puts Olivier to task. Just brilliant.".

	schema:headline " A very satisfying period drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Historically relevant A Royal Affair shows its true perioddrama nature in the very intelligent and detailed storyline steadfast and conspicuous acting and most of all sumptuous and glorious interiors which actually enhance the visual experience significantly. The film expressively reminds the world once again about the illicit affair between Caroline Mathilde Alicia Vikander the beautiful Queen of Denmark and the enlightened Germanborn physician named Johann Struensee Mads Mikkelsen. In all its courtly essence A Royal Affair presents this 18th century tale with utmost thoroughness adding huge amounts of tension to its naturalistic substance with every following minute. While it's mostly recognized for the meaningful romantic overtone this film presents much more than that even though the starcrossed lovers prove to have the biggest impact on the unexpected turn of events. It starts very similarly to Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette with a young princess bound to marry a king she doesn't even know through the oldfashioned way of a royal transaction. Right after the Queen finally sets her lovely eyes on the mysterious husbandtobe one thing is certain  there is something wrong with his majestic appearance. Christian VII Mikkel Boe Flsgaard giggles nervously and is more interested in greeting his own dog than the woman with whom he will probably but not likely spend the rest of his palace life. Right after the both absolutely awkward and truly humorous announcement of King's nightly visit in his wife's bedroom and Caroline's anxiously awaited pregnancy it becomes perfectly clear that the pair won't present itself in the expected regal way. Those two characters don't even intend to give the appearance of being fully in love with each other. The king wanders angrily around the luxurious chambers making fun of everyone not knowing that he ostentatiously presents all of his biggest weaknesses. At the same time the Queen spends most of her time with the newborn baby. When Christian proclaims his forthcoming trip around Europe nobody realizes that big and sudden changes are about to happen. During the journey King's mental illness becomes worse. He needs a private doctor and he needs him quick. This is the moment when Johan Struensee first shows his handsome face. Apart from his unquestionable medical abilities he proves to be a great admirer of the Enlightenment movement's greatest thinkers and their innovative works and that's what makes him an ideal partner for the King. After returning to the country their companionship grows stronger every day. Unfortunately so does Johan's affection towards Queen's aweinspiring persona. After a while it becomes awfully obvious that they won't be able to suppress their deepest urges and a risky romance will soon take place one that might actually begin a new era in the history of Denmark. Scheming behind the back of the wigwearing ignorant council Caroline and Struensee use the gullible King for the sake of a greater good  they create many new and reformative laws and using Christian's powerful yet unstable hand they end up improving the whole land and its citizens' life rushing Denmark towards the desired Enlightenment.As history so often shows when there is the optimistic hardworking side there must also be the pessimistic mischievous one. In A Royal Affair it takes the form of an ominous recalcitrant aristocrat named Ove HeghGuldberg David Dencik. Conspiring along with Christian's stepmother Juliane Marie Trine Dyrholm he comes up with a perfect plan to get rid of the unwanted German and at the same time bring back Denmark's old 'glory'. Revealing the shocking truth about Queen being pregnant with Struensee he wreaks havoc among the society. The return of the Dark Ages is upon Denmark and no one is able to stop this devastating process as the King gave in to Ove's strong and convincing character and ultimately to his own illness. Johann and Caroline are banished from the Kingdom just to see that sadly their thorough plan wasn't actually meant to help anyone.With its splendidly high entertainment value A Royal Affair turns out to be a history lesson for everyone. Considerable attention to details in plot and in art design brings out the true substance of the film. The costumes are pitchperfect the music flows adequately to the events and the ongoing transition in the atmosphere intensifies the reception of the whole. A Royal Affair possesses a great energy which shows its true strength in all the performances. Without offending anyone from the amazing cast it's important to note that Mads Mikkelsen gave the most awardworthy performance showing the straightforwardly persuasive impassiveness that may really convince his fans and antifans alike. Therefore those irrefutable acting skills combined with a wellwritten script and steady direction make A Royal Affair one of the most memorable Danish movies of the last decade.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fantastic film about a country whose history is seldom portrayed A Royal Affair is a historical drama set in the latter half of the 18th century in Denmark. An English girl is sent off to marry the Danish king only to find out that he's not fully sane. In her loneliness she falls for the king's doctor and they find they share not only amorous feelings for one another but a passion for Enlightenment ideas and political reforms.There are a few caricatures in this movie that keep me from giving it a higher score the reactionary forces are pure unalloyed evil the reformers are probably far more liberal in thinking than would have been possible in that era and the preaching against established religion is a bit thick. But otherwise this is a gem of a movie with outstanding performances in all three key roles particularly the doctor who is portrayed with an incredible intensity and realism. Also noteworthy is the king who is not quite sane yet not totally loony either the acting here is frighteningly good and utterly convincing. Last but not least the queen excels in showing real pathos and longsuffering endurance trapped in her destiny and then comes alive beautifully in her relationship with the doctor.As icing on the cake costumes are sumptuous period settings flawless and the music is eraappropriate and delightfully arcane. Original music is also quite good though most of the time one is so engrossed in the story that the music just vanishes. Movie is almost all in Danish with English subtitles and I felt the sizefont choice for the titles was too big too pushy you never quite forget that you're reading titles.This is a tale of exploration of the darker side of the human experience what does it mean to be sane how can a divinely ordained monarch be deprived of his wits to what lengths will a person go to promote hisher progeny into power are the unwashed masses really grateful to those who try to emancipate them? This movie and its three main characters will haunt you for many days.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Royal Affair is a DanishSwedishCzech production about the reign of 18th century King Christian VII of Denmark his Welsh wife and a German physician whose progressive ideas shake Denmark's conservative ruling class to its foundations. As best I can discern the film tries to keep true to actual history with some embellishments added concerning the role of the Queen in the political machinations along with some reasonable speculation about a possible menage a trois. The screenplay by Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg does a nice job of capturing the unusual atmosphere of life at a court governed by a mentally unstable monarch who's little more than a nuisance puppet of the nobility and the church. In the middle of all that is the young English Queen trapped in a loveless marriage. She is also disturbed by the unwillingness of her adopted country to accept the ideas of the Enlightenment then circulating around Europe. Under the direction of Nikolaj Arcel A Royal Affair is an effective recreation of a bygone age yet one in which we can see our contemporary quagmire between those who advocate change and those condemning it. Mikkel Folsgaard is excellent as the King. He never descends to caricature and is both powerful and pitiable. Mads Mikkelsen is compelling as Dr. Johann Struensee a noble but flawed man given a rare opportunity to improve the lot of the lower classes who are suspicious of him as a foreigner usurping the state. Alicia Vikander is Caroline Mathilde a Welsh princess sent to Denmark in an arranged marriage of noble households with no idea of what's in store for her. This is very good intelligent costume drama that should please fans of the genre. Well worth seeing.".

The King  a beautifully judged performance by Mikkel Boe Folsgaard  is little more than an overgrown child with minimal interest in his bride  another fine performance by Alicia Vikander  and the catalyst in the woodpile is not the young Negro boy he treats as a pet so much as the German physician Mads Mikkelson a devotee of Rousseau who quickly gains the King's ear and the Queen's bed with the result that soon all three unite in a nonsexual menage a trois and push through several important reforms. It does of course end in tears but it also keeps us riveted for some two and a quarter hours. A fine effort.".

I was beginning to wonder whether he was quite as insane as people thought him to be. There seemed to be a genuine friendship between him and Dr Struensee also. Had things gone slightly differently one could have imagined them forming a happy and successful mnage  trois and living happily ever after.And the villains were truly villainous I spotted a few familiar faces from Forbydelsen I and other places including Sren Malling Jan Mayer  and Bent Mejding who was the standing mayor playing a not dissimilar sort of characterA very interesting and surprising historical lesson as well.Highly recommended.".

However the interesting aspect of this story is the context. It is the second half of the 18th century liberal ideals of people like Rousseau and Voltaire spread across Europe and threatens to break down the old Feudalistic regime.The movie is not a documentary on the ruling of Christian the VII and should not be regarded as such. After seeing it I went to read about Christian the VII and found that many details of the era and his regime were omitted in favor of not making a long tiresome movie. Instead the movie focuses on the relationships between the king the queen and the physician and to their attempt to change the face of Denmark.These three characters are played beautifully. Mikkel Boe Flsgaard as King Christian is just superb and fun to watch as a mad king he is always there even when not the focus of the camera.Mads Mikkelsen as the physician acts for the most part as a calm yet stern person however when he does display emotions it has greater impact and in my view portraits innerstruggle more effectively. Alicia Vikander as the queen plays her two role quite well whether it is the passion and stress that go with having a secret affair or the audacity and charm that goes with fulfilling her royal duties.Finally in my view the movie is another bell ring to remind us that even Denmark 300 years ago was a country consumed by religion and fear and that there are always those who believe in such a way of life.".

I would agree that it was a very well made film about some interesting people though the film was otherwise a rather unremarkable biopic. Good but I could see why it didn't take the prize.The story is about the Queen of Denmark Caroline Mathhildethe sister of George III of Britain. And while some of the small details might not be correct the story itself is based on her sad and short life. After marrying King Christian VII she soon realizes he's mentally unstable and rather perverseand has absolutely no interest in her. It's a lonely life until she falls in love with the King's favorite a German doctor who eventually becomes the virtual leader of Denmark. What's next? See the filmthough I suppose you could just read up on her on Wikipedia! But you probably shouldn't. The acting and quality of the production is very good and quite compelling. A very good film but one that is at times a bit difficult to like because the characters in the movie are a bit hard to likeeven the 'good' ones.".

Church state and the nobility pitching itself against writers doctors and freethinking women. Denmark is portrayed as the vanguard of European progressive politics. Voltaire would have been actually he was proud.As a piece of cinema it is terrific. Beautifully shot it evokes Kubrik's Barry Lyndon at times but actually has a heart and soul.

The story is beautifully photographed by Rasmus Videbk the stunning costumes are by Manon Rasmussen and the important musical score is in the capable hands of Gabriel Yared and Cyrille Aufort.

If this sounds like a disaster waiting to happen then you know where this story is headed. The young Queen quickly finds out that she has married a bit of a whack job but endears herself to Denmark by quickly providing a royal heir.

Oh did I forget to mention that this film is in Danish with English subtitles? They would actually have been speaking German in the Danish Court of the time but it's a Danish film so let's not quibble about that. Christian brings back a certain German Dr. Johann Struensee with him from his Grand Tour who as well as befriending and acting as a calming influence on the young King brings some radical notions to Denmark like smallpox vaccination freedom for serfs and the abolition of torture. He is able to use the King's power to drag Denmark into the modern era of The Enlightenment. This film takes place around the time of the American and French Revolutions to give some context. Dr. Struensee finds a kindred spirit for his progressive ideas in the young Queen and well let's just say that the history books seem to agree that her second child a daughter was fathered by the good doctor! If you enjoy a gorgeous slow political romance then this is your film. Just make sure you see it with someone who is also into that kind of film.

	schema:headline " A Beautiful Danish Film";
	schema:reviewBody "I am one of youA Royal Affair is a Danish film that has recently been nominated at the Oscars for Best Foreign Film and rightfully so. It is my favorite movie in that category so far considering this is a period drama with a great storyline beautiful production design and excellent performances from the lead cast. Every period drama seems to focus on the art and production design so much that it sometimes forgets about the importance of the story and character development but that isn't the case here because despite the careful attention to the art design there was a great story to be told. I felt this was a much more complete film than the recent remake of Anna Karenina which also happened to star the beautiful Alicia Vikander who has a lead role here. Vikander seems perfect for these roles with her young and angelical face and she also gives an incredible and strong performance. This movie will open several doors for her and I expect to see her in many more films in the future. The story is based on historical events that I'm pretty sure every Danish knew about but I was pleased to be introduced to this period of history. The screenplay was adapted by Rasmus Heisterberg from the novel written by Bodil SteensenLeth. Heisterberg had cowritten the screenplay to the Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with Nikolaj Arcel the director of this film. Arcel directs this film with great craft balancing out the technical aspects with the detailed historical events that took place in this 18th century tale. This felt like a great history lesson for me and an entertaining one at it and was satisfied with this period drama thanks to a clever script and some strong lead performances. The film takes place in Denmark during the mid 18th century as we are introduced to the young queen Caroline Mathilde Alicia Vikander from Britain who is to be married with the Danish King Christian VII Mikkel Boe Folsgaard. She has never seen the King or knows what he is like but royal arrangements have already been made for their marriage as she travels to Denmark to meet her husband. Upon arriving in this new land she discovers that the King is not very fond of her he seems a little childish and giggles nervously. He receives his dog with much more love than he receives her. Caroline is resigned to live her life this way until she meets the royal physician Johann Struensee Mads Mikkelsen who happens to share her same beliefs and ideals. Europe was in a state of transition as The Enlightenment movement was revolutionizing the Dark Ages with new ideas from Voltaire and Rousseau but Denmark remained tied to the Middle Ages with their traditions. The council formed by noble men and clergy was running everything and Christian VII was only the puppet signing the documents. Upon the arrival of Dr. Johann Struensee a German intellectual influenced by the enlightenment philosophy things began to change in the Kingdom as he greatly influenced the King. Although at first he spent most his time fooling around with the King and winning his trust he ends up falling in love with Caroline and begins to have an affair with her. Caroline realizes that Johann has a great influence in the King so she asks him to use that confidence to gain more power in the council and revolutionize the nation with humanitarian ideals. Of course Johann's influence on the King isn't welcomed by the noblemen who will do what it takes to regain their power.A Royal Affair stands out from other typical romantic triangles in that here there is really no interest from one party. The King doesn't love his wife and prefers to spend time with Johann fooling around. He calls his wife mother because he believes she is no fun at all. The affair would have gone unnoticed by everyone if it weren't for the brave ideals that Caroline and Johann came up with in order to start a revolution. This is what upset the noblemen who found a way to distance the King from his physician and this is where the tension begins to escalate in the movie. That is also what makes the romance so risky and torrid and in a way makes the story so juicy. The film is really engaging and entertaining and works wonderfully as a period drama. The script is very clever and introduces several quotes from Rousseau and Voltaire who were a great influence in that time period. Perhaps the films ends up being a little too predictable but it does so because it sticks with the historical facts and that is pretty much how things happened. I thought the film ended in a rather hopeful note despite it not having a happy ending. Mads Mikkelsen Alicia Vikander and Mikkel Boe Folsgaard stand out in this film with some terrific performances and make this film stand out above the rest.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "I am one of youA Royal Affair is a Danish film that has recently been nominated at the Oscars for Best Foreign Film and rightfully so. It is my favorite movie in that category so far considering this is a period drama with a great storyline beautiful production design and excellent performances from the lead cast. Every period drama seems to focus on the art and production design so much that it sometimes forgets about the importance of the story and character development but that isn't the case here because despite the careful attention to the art design there was a great story to be told. I felt this was a much more complete film than the recent remake of Anna Karenina which also happened to star the beautiful Alicia Vikander who has a lead role here. Vikander seems perfect for these roles with her young and angelical face and she also gives an incredible and strong performance. This movie will open several doors for her and I expect to see her in many more films in the future.

	schema:headline " A Royal Love Triangle";
	schema:reviewBody "A Royal Affair is about exactly what its title tells us. Caroline is an English princess who was married off to the King of Denmark in fulfillment of her childhood dreams. They meet for the first time when she went to Denmark but she was distressed to discover that her husband Christian is not of completely sound mind. After her first child was born and wallowing in constant loneliness Caroline begins the titular royal affair with Struensee the court physician who was also Christian's best friend and adviser. Caroline and Struensee not only share romantic love but also a passion for political reform. Struensee uses his very influential position to institute radically progressive policies which eventually revolutionizes Denmark society.Needless to say this is the first time I have ever seen anything about Danish history so I was enraptured  not really about the affair but more about the interesting stories of political machinations and social reformation told in this very fine film. The lavish costumes elaborate set design and moody music were all perfectly attuned to the period depicted. The cinematography was very dramatic and wellpolished.The acting was topnotch from all three angles of the troika. Young Swedish actress Alicia Vikander was very classy and believable as Caroline. She reminded me of Emily Blunt's performance in Young Victoria the previous year. Famous Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen plays Dr. Johann Struensee with subtle passion. He does look a lot older than Caroline so the romantic chemistry seemed somehow strained especially at the beginning. It does grow on you later though as the more political aspect of their affair gains more screen time. As the cuckolded king Christian VII Mikkel Boe Flsgaard delivers a finely nuanced performance as he struggled to balance his madness with some semblance of sanity.I highly recommend this film for all film fans who love historical films. This is a rare look into a renaissance of sorts in Danish political history borne out of personal liaisons among the key characters in the reform movement. The storytelling style of director Nikolaj Arcel is tight and engaging. It will keep you interested up to the end especially with the inspired performances of all his actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "To begin with being a superhero fan in general and a fan of Asian movies will definitely help as to whether or not the viewer will find this film worthwhile. I happen to be both and for the most part I enjoyed this decently done movie. First the cons The plot mainly involving the protest of a nuclear power plant being constructed was somewhat interesting but since the movie is over two hours long it does drag on at times and by the end you just don't care what happens all that much. Time seems to jump around a lot too. The story includes multiple flashbacks most of them are to help establish Red Eagle's background which is fine but they occur too often throughout the movie and some are just a tad overdone. The acting isn't all that great either. There's really zero chemistry between Red Eagle Ananda Everingham and his companion Vasana Tienpradab Yarinda Bunnag and after they pull off this awkward rushed no real nudity sex scene in a huge refrigerator full of ice blocks it looks like they're going to high five when he drops her off. Last the pros Clearly the action. You can never have enough action but it's peppered throughout the movie just enough to remind you that you're still watching an action movie. At times the cinematography the lighting the color and the special effects are spectacular. Occasionally when Red Eagle breaks an enemy bone somewhere you'll see an inmotion Xray of the actual bone breaking like in Romeo Must Die and Final Destination 4. One of the high points of the movie about halfway in is when Red Eagle meets up with an assassin called Black Devil that was hired to kill him. A long awesome fight sequence ensues complete with a chase over building tops a well executed sword fight and a showdown on the ceiling of a falling elevator. Also the few unexpected Red Eagle's gadgets that spring up from time to time serve as a nice Batmanlike touch. A big refresher too is the fact that Red Eagle doesn't hold back on any moral issues when fighting the bad guys. They don't have their hands cuffed but cut off rather and a high amount of bloodsoaked fatalities spread over most of the battles. I must admit some action movies after watching once throughout I will watch again but just skip through the talking to just the action itself. This is one of those type of films. I still did enjoy the entire film overall and do recommend it especially to anyone to enjoys the crime fighting genre. So give it a try and once you get through it you'll see what I mean.".

Occasionally when Red Eagle breaks an enemy bone somewhere you'll see an inmotion Xray of the actual bone breaking like in Romeo Must Die and Final Destination 4. One of the high points of the movie about halfway in is when Red Eagle meets up with an assassin called Black Devil that was hired to kill him. A long awesome fight sequence ensues complete with a chase over building tops a well executed sword fight and a showdown on the ceiling of a falling elevator. Also the few unexpected Red Eagle's gadgets that spring up from time to time serve as a nice Batmanlike touch. A big refresher too is the fact that Red Eagle doesn't hold back on any moral issues when fighting the bad guys. They don't have their hands cuffed but cut off rather and a high amount of bloodsoaked fatalities spread over most of the battles. I must admit some action movies after watching once throughout I will watch again but just skip through the talking to just the action itself. This is one of those type of films. I still did enjoy the entire film overall and do recommend it especially to anyone to enjoys the crime fighting genre. So give it a try and once you get through it you'll see what I mean.";

I think the creators who have done a great job should look at Bruce Timm et al.'s Justice League series to handle that amount of characters and still please everyone. I think JL was done in such a way that is after the first season's somewhat rocky startthat the episodes played to each of the characters strengths. I don't think this has happened in the Ultimate Avengers 2. The first one was much closer to accomplishing that. Also after the first one and waiting for the second I was disappointed with the plot same villains same set up. I was like The first movie all over again... It obviously wasn't exactly like the first but I thought it would have played better if the creators broke from the first one altogether and started a new plot. I was disappointed with the plot in UA2. Over all it's very good. Animation is great action is great voice talent great. It's great to see Captain America back the way he always should have been.

Everythign from his claws to the suit was aweinspiring. The authors took some artistic liberties with it though. For instance they made the suit transform to a liking of a panther in the face when the user T'Challa gets angry or emotional. Still quite excellent.Thor was... Godly  Iron Man's War Machiene suit was sick. And whoever wrote his characters lines did excellent. I love some of his lines. The emotional hook of Giant Man and Wasp was not overbearing but it was there and it did its job. You felt the attachment and I was a little disappointed by Gian Man's death... Touching. The authors showed a new side of Cap. Instead of being entirely selfrighteous he showed his bitter side. I thought it added more depth to the character and played off nicely. As always the Black Widow provided the sexy sense of adult that the animation might have been lacking previously. She was the glue that help Cap and the team together it seemed to me.The hulk was a minor spotlight in this film if he showed at all. But that is understandable if you have seen the previous film. Shame he is a star hero Overall a GREAT movie though I liked the first one a little better due to some of the battles. The Hulk  Avengers battle was on of the best I've seen in the animated comic universe.".

What surprised me is the fact that this second film establishes the characters better and has substantial character development. I know that sounds strange when describing a cartoon but these characters really shine this time around.Like with the first film I've read different reactions and I've heard from both sides of the adaptation debate. Some serious Ultimates fans wanted this movie to be an exact reenactment of the comic book. Marvel instead made a conscious decision to infuse the old school Avengers in to the Ultimates mix. It's still a good call and a masterful decision. The combination works very well. Gone are the overblown and quite frankly juvenile elements of the Ultimates. Having a horny Hulk or an outrageously abusive Henry Pym may work to capture the teenage comic crowd which is exactly why the Ultimate Universe was created but it doesn't play with main stream audiences. The ONLY reason the Ultimates succeeded as a book is because of the incredible artwork of Bryan Hitch which is on ample display in the Ultimates bonus featurette. The characters that made the Ultimates possible in the first place shines through. Captain America is still perfect. You can really see why Marvel is lining up to give him his own live action movie. The introduction of the Black Panther is perfect as well. Iron Man steals the show and his shift to War Machine armor will have long time fans grinning from ear to ear. My only two problems were with the treatment of Henry Pym and the lack of substantial Hulk action Hulk does smash but not near enough but those are just minor quibbles. Overall this is a wonderful movie.PS I can't wait for the Iron Man solo movie they previewed on the DVD. The jury is still out on Dr. Strange however.".

Probably one of my favorite movies of all time.Now a lot of people are comparing it with the first movie so here are my thoughts on the comparison1. Action  there was a lot more action in this movie and the action was more brutal panther tearing up that super alien was sweet. But the quality of the action scenes in the first movie were better. In this movie we get to see a lot of little skirmishes which showcase the abilities of each character but there was no major battle scene like the hulk rumble we had in the first movie. The battle between panther and capt. America vs kleus i know its spelled wrong could have been a lot better if there weren't so many cuts. You had the impression you were viewing a comic strip but it was still sweet coz it was so brutal. Thor wasn't given enough action in this film... although they did showcase a lot more of his other talents like teleportation. and thor did save the most number of lives saved the whole avengers team saved pym saved ironman. but i was really wanting to see him kick butt. Hulk didn't do anything... just slammed an alien or two. So between the 2 movies i loved the action of the 1st more.2. Story  the 2nd movie definitely had more story. We are given a flash back of capt's story then given a background on t'challa black panther then there's the subtle love stories of pymwasp captwidow bannerbetty. And we're also given a sneak preview into the armory of tony...and of course the hints of thor's prodigality with his father. There maybe some who wouldn't appreciate this kind of plots in a comic book film but we're forgetting that this is only 1 film in 8 and it is necessary to build up the stories of each character to establish them. So I actually liked this 2nd movie better just for the fact that it had a thicker plot to it and could absorb you more in its story. I was just a bit disappointed with the action though... they should have added an entire 30 mins to the film just so they could give more emphasis to the fight scenes. The capt.apantherkleus could have been so much better and would have been the highlight of the movie. I hope the makers of this movie could read a couple of these posts so they could do something and make the next movie a lot longer.".

Heck the animated direct to DVD features from Marvel  DC have been pretty hit  miss on both sides and sadly UA2 is a miss for Marvel. The first Ultimate Avengers while not perfect was still a solid introduction to the characters their dynamics and their personal issues. The sequel however fails to offer any truly satisfying resolutions to those problems. Captain America's struggle to adjust to the 21st century and the effect it's having on his personality  work ethic is touched upon again but it never really goes anywhere nor does the brief contrast shown between Iron Man and Captain America ever really develop and his hook up at the end with Black Widow feels forced despite some previous hints of a mutual infatuation between them. Similarly the marital problems between Hank 'Giant Man' Pym and his wife Janet 'Wasp' Pym are revisited and shown to have gotten worse as Hank is made out to be an even bigger asshole with an oversized ego here than he was in the first film but as with Captain America's problems the manner in which it is concluded  with Giant Man dying in the final act in what is apparently meant to be his redemption for being an egocentric jerk for most of the story  is not a satisfying one. If anything Giant Man's death feels forced in the most laughable manner partly because he really didn't even take enough abuse during the fight to warrant dying.Iron Man himself was one of the few highlights of the film and Black Panther came across pretty good but that doesn't redeem the film's big flaw it feels like it was rushed out the gate as quickly as possible and the story  characters suffer for it. It's too bad because the potential for a better animated film was definitely there but it just wasn't utilized. Still the outtakes in the special features section were pretty funny.".

The movie seems to pick up nottoolong after the first with the heroes separated and doing their own thing. Bruce Bannerthe Incredible Hulk is locked up for the tantrum he through in the first movie. Steve RogersCaptain America is slowly becoming a loner preferring to work missions alone. The Pyms Hank and Janet are experiencing some marital problems and Thor has completely dropped off the radar. The heroes are reunited when the Chitauri return led by Herr Kleiser who was thought to have been killed by Captain America near the end of World War II. This time the Chitauri have their eyes set on the isolated African nation of Wakanda ruled by T'Challathe Black Panther.This is the second movie in Marvel's animated line and they have managed to make minor improvements over the previous. Unfortunately they haven't made any attempts to improve on the animation style at all. So the closer you see a character the more hiccups and stiffness you see in the animation. Of course the action scenes still look awesome and we get some great battles out of Iron Man Captain America and Thor. Seeing as how the Hulk is restrained for the majority of the movie we don't get the same raw power out of him that was exhibited in Avengers I.The Black Panther was an excellent addition to the movie and made for an entertaining enough story. I have been interested in the Black Panther storyline since I first started reading up on him so it was nice to see him included in the latest Avengers installment. While the first movie's story was thin this time around we are treated to more history and slightly more character development. My only major complaint with the story in Avengers II was the Chitauri...I think it's time to move on. There are plenty of villainsangry alien races out there. The only thought to cross my mind when I saw the Chitauri in this movie was Again?. I'm hoping that they try something fresh next time.And of course its nice to see that Marvel didn't sugarcoat this movie down to a PG or G rating in an effort to appeal to the grade school crowd. They included enough action even included a little brutality to earn the movie a PG13. All in all this movie is better than the first but not by leaps and bounds. Although if the pattern continues I think we can expect some real gems out of Marvel's animated lineup in the future.".

Ultimate avengers 2 starts off with the death of the black panther and the son takes over him. Now he goes to find Captain America and asks him to join forces with him to defeat the whatever monsters coming to destroy the world. Super story but short. Its' actions will blast you off with its' cool music but what can we do if the plot is just straight forward. I am not saying I hate the movie but they can extend it not making the two movies like a minimovie series. Oh well I don't know whether they are making Ultimate avengers 3 but if they do it better be the best of all the Ultimate avengers movies.Well the special features are nothing much but it does have some cool sneak previews.

The First and second movies were just plain tedious because apparently in this universe when the war was over Bucky doesn't become the Winter Soldier but instead he retires and steels Steve Rogers wifegirlfriend. Oh but it doesn't stop there Hank Pym is more or less like Scott Lang in this universe because he is a massive jerk to the Avengers and his main priority is his wife and only his wife for example in the first mission when the Avengers were in trouble and he heard Janet scream. But in the end AntMan makes a good sacrifice. He was about to break the building down and not worried about the other Avengers. In the second movie he was the same except that this time when his wife was hurt he threaten to throw Captain America out if he didn't leave. The Hulk was just a mindless brute like in the MCU and the reason why Betty divorced Bruce was because of the Hulk. Speaking of I didn't really find Betty a nice woman in these films because of that. Thor Iron Man Wasp Apart from the fact she looked too much like Hope Pym and had darker skin colour Black Panther and Black Widow were just themselves. Speaking of Black Panther in the second movie we get introduced to him I found this one just too bloody and brutal when a General stabbed his dad and when the General got stabbed a couple of times but wasn't even dying. I also found it just plain stupid that Iron Man was wearing the War Machine Armor. If you are an Avengers fan I would recommend you don't waste your money on these movies. You might be disappointed. My overall score 410 for both movies.".

It leaps head first into its story albeit the story follows on from the end of the first movie.This time the key plot factor is that the Chitauri aliens from the first movie are after the vibranium deposit in Wakanda which means we are introduced to T'Challa as well as Captain America's old foe Kleiser who turns out to be a Chitauri.There is as much soapy stuff about the characters' problems and interactions as there is action relating to the main plot and to be frank I could have done without that  I like my superheroes to be heroes. But I appreciate it for what it is.The animation is no better than Saturday morning TV animation.But it's not bad.";

	schema:reviewBody "That is not to say at all that I disliked the first Ultimate Avengers or anything. Actually I did enjoy it even if I didn't love it. Ultimate Avengers 2 is not quite perfect either the Hulk is underused and Giant Man's death for me was a little forced. On the other hand the animation is great the character designs are much less jerky and more focused here and the colours and backgrounds are detailed and coloured beautifully. The score is full of drive and again has a haunting undercurrent the writing is sharp and the action is grittier and is exciting. The characters apart from Hulk are interesting Black Panther is a great addition and Thor is much better written than he was in the first one. The pace is much more even the first halfhour doesn't feel all that dragged out and the ending is not as rushed. There is much more story here as a result and it is compelling stuff indeed. The voice acting is solid across as the board with nobody coming across as a thorn in the side. All in all a very good film and better than the first in my view. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "With ultimate Avengers 2 i can see that Marvel is moving away from just doing another animated adaptation of The Ultimatesan excellent graphic novel miniseries by Mark Millar but rather establishing the Ultimate Avenger universe as a separate animated universe altogether.The Black Panther is introduced here and the whole Chitauri arc from the first movie is carried on to a satisfying conclusion. Overall better than the first movie but my main beef is that IT'S TOO SHORT!!!!A few points good and bad 1 The violence. Its been taken up a notch with the movie starting off with the bloody death of the original Black Panther. Every punch cut and hit that the characters take are presented very intensely. Not overly violence as say SPAWN but sufficiently bloody to not want to let 11 year olds and below to watch.2 The story. Definitely better than the first since it doesn't have any prior graphic novel to live up to. the story does sufficiently well on its own only problem is that its too short.3 THe characters. Give and take. Some characters like Captain American Black Panther and Bruce banner are developed very well here and you get to understand their full intentions and purpose on why they do what they do and why they are who they are. I expected more from Hank PymGiant Man though SPOILERseeing as how he dies at the endSPOILER END4The animation. Got better i must say. THe matte backgrounds are definitely more stunning and less flat compared to those in the first movie especially the external jungle and Wakanda scenes. However the inconsistency is still there. Great scenes like Black Panther's first battle with the Avengers  Captain America and Black Panther's final fight with Klaiser all are very detailed very smooth animation with high frame rate and no short cuts. However the big scenes like the aliens worldwide invasion and the Wakanda alien big battle look terrible. The move to do everything in traditional 2D is a noble one in this day and age of overly used 3D animation but a good blending of 2D and celshaded 3D would have been better for the big battle scenes. The animation is still not up to MOVIE standard but will suffice as a TV show.Once again if Marvel had combined Ultimate Avengers 1 and 2 and Marketed them as say a 8 episode miniseries? I'm sure people wont be so quick to criticize. But alas they marketed them as 2 movies and thus making the public expect MOVIE quality animation and story. What we have is a topoftheline first few episodes of a TV series or good OVA miniseries or subpar movie.".

I dont like it when heroes die because I don't watch super hero movies so that evil may triumph over a good IN ANY WAY. If Giant man does not come back somehow in Ultimate Avengers 3 a big boo for Marvel.Dont get me wrong the movie is not bad but it focuses more on issues from real life like love courage etc. than on making a cool and developed plot.

	schema:headline " fun but forgettable film";
	schema:reviewBody "Fading of the Cries is inconsistent. It packs a punch but only in certain parts most noticeable the third act. That is the whole problem with this film from beginning to end. Its biggest weakness  the acting hands down. Leads newcomer Jordan Matthews and ER's Hallee Hirsh who play Jacob and Sarah both have a serious lack of any chemistry whatsoever and one tends to get quite annoyed at Jordan Matthews at times when he reads off dull monotonic lines with no expression as if reading from a script on the spot. As an actor myself I notice he tends to fall into numerous acting traps that many amateurs first do  namely not enough practiceexperience. Actress Hallee Hirsh tends to overact all of her scenes with an overabundance of annoyance maybe overcompensating off her lead who is giving her nothing to work with. I've read reviews stating similarities to both Twilight and The Crow. Here's my two cents Say what you will about Twilight there was strong chemistry there between Edward and Bella that you could feel. That's what that film did right and this ain't no Twilight. What Brandon Lee did correct about The Crow was giving his character a sense of pain and emotion. I get nothing from Jordan Matthews. Then again he could be going for the stereotypical action actor without any acting talent in which case I would state to learn how to walk properly without doing the duck butt sticking out and you're there.Genre favorite Brad Dourif and even Mackenzie Rosman on the other hand managed to pull off decent performances. Brad plays the antagonist of the film with such precise clarity that one almost feels bad he has almost nobody to play with scenewise. It shows what happens when you compare someone of his caliber level with the likes of notalents like Jordan Matthews who does an embarrassingly bad job in the film's final standoff . Mackenzie also holds her own as the bratty younger sister pulled into the nightmare. Some of the visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and some are not so great. The scenes deep rooted in reality feel almost like a TV movie of the week while some of the visual effects scenes feel like a major motion picture. The strongest consistency this film has is the pacing. It never tends to let you down and picks up pace quite quickly in the third act. Some of the scenes are very well directed while others are lacking. Since this was also his first movie I might assume that Brian A. Metcalf might not fall into the same trappings again. I will state that the film had more of a story than I had originally expected and if only the acting had been better the characters might had been more believable. I actually feel that writerdirector Brian A. Metcalf might have had a little cult gem had he worked with stronger actors as he does have quite a unique and stylized vision i.e. the sunrays that seem to overtake this film and constant movement of background bats and crows. His dialogue needed some polishing but again had he worked with more talented actors they might have been able to pull it off more convincingly. This was the case with Brad who by far had the most elaborate lines in the film and pulled them off with such ease. As director James Cameron says choosing the right actor is by far one of the most important tasks in a film because once you have them you're stuck with them. I would like to see how another film by Brian would turn out given a better budget stronger cast and crew. But Brian is not off the hook so easily as some of the scenes felt there was a lack of coverage. The kitchen scene tends to show the most.Costuming was terrible and the costumer Elizabeth Jett should be quite embarrassed about the poor job she did showing her extreme lack of talent and vision. Same can be said for some of the creature makeup effects. Lighting on the other hand was very nicely tackled. There are so many independent films where you can't see a thing at night due to lack of experienced DPs or budget constraints. I could at least see every scene with a decent amount of detail in the dark and that is becoming a rarity these days with independents.I understand that dealing with the independent world there are many challenges foreseen and unforeseen. As a person who works mainly with the independent film world I get a lot of the problems that happen. I do feel many of these mistakes could have been avoided had proper planning been in place again I revert back to the acting. All considering for a low budget indie film Fading of the Cries seems to be a strong step above other independents namely the production values and locations. I would recommend this film only if you can get past the bad acting and have nothing better to do. Overall it turns out to be a fun but not overly memorable film.Final rating 1 to 10Story  7 Execution  4 largely due to poor acting Acting  2 12 not a 1 only because actor Brad Dourif does remarkable Directing  6 Production Value  7 largely due to well lit scenes at night and some decent fx Costuming  3 Makeup  4 Sound Design  3 12 Music  7I give it 5 12 out of 10 stars only with the consideration it was an independent film.".

	onyx:emotionText "Fading of the Cries is inconsistent. It packs a punch but only in certain parts most noticeable the third act. That is the whole problem with this film from beginning to end. Its biggest weakness  the acting hands down. Leads newcomer Jordan Matthews and ER's Hallee Hirsh who play Jacob and Sarah both have a serious lack of any chemistry whatsoever and one tends to get quite annoyed at Jordan Matthews at times when he reads off dull monotonic lines with no expression as if reading from a script on the spot. As an actor myself I notice he tends to fall into numerous acting traps that many amateurs first do  namely not enough practiceexperience. Actress Hallee Hirsh tends to overact all of her scenes with an overabundance of annoyance maybe overcompensating off her lead who is giving her nothing to work with. I've read reviews stating similarities to both Twilight and The Crow. Here's my two cents Say what you will about Twilight there was strong chemistry there between Edward and Bella that you could feel. That's what that film did right and this ain't no Twilight. What Brandon Lee did correct about The Crow was giving his character a sense of pain and emotion. I get nothing from Jordan Matthews. Then again he could be going for the stereotypical action actor without any acting talent in which case I would state to learn how to walk properly without doing the duck butt sticking out and you're there.Genre favorite Brad Dourif and even Mackenzie Rosman on the other hand managed to pull off decent performances. Brad plays the antagonist of the film with such precise clarity that one almost feels bad he has almost nobody to play with scenewise. It shows what happens when you compare someone of his caliber level with the likes of notalents like Jordan Matthews who does an embarrassingly bad job in the film's final standoff . Mackenzie also holds her own as the bratty younger sister pulled into the nightmare. Some of the visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and some are not so great. The scenes deep rooted in reality feel almost like a TV movie of the week while some of the visual effects scenes feel like a major motion picture. The strongest consistency this film has is the pacing. It never tends to let you down and picks up pace quite quickly in the third act. Some of the scenes are very well directed while others are lacking. Since this was also his first movie I might assume that Brian A. Metcalf might not fall into the same trappings again. I will state that the film had more of a story than I had originally expected and if only the acting had been better the characters might had been more believable. I actually feel that writerdirector Brian A. Metcalf might have had a little cult gem had he worked with stronger actors as he does have quite a unique and stylized vision i.e. the sunrays that seem to overtake this film and constant movement of background bats and crows. His dialogue needed some polishing but again had he worked with more talented actors they might have been able to pull it off more convincingly.

	schema:reviewBody "So I've read all the reviews watched the film and now have come up with my own conclusions. I guess after reading so many comments I felt inclined to put in my own thoughts.My friends and I went in simply expecting an entertaining lowbudget zombie horror movie and we got an entertaining lowbudget horror movie. The film starts off with Sarah finding some antique in her attic along with booze leaving and finding her friend. Within a matter of minutes they are attacked by zombies when Jacob comes in to save the day out of practically nowhere which is later described in the film. Soon they are running around on streets and into the fields hacking and chopping up zombies and dismembering them. Okay we had fun watching that and were always excited to see them getting sliced by the blade.Soon they run into an abandoned shelter or something where they are attacked by some wraith or something that reminded me of the glass creature from Conan the Destroyer. The creature jumps out the window and the two are forced to then go down into some huge tunnel or cave. And it goes on and on and on with different obstacles like a bridge and cornfields which was my personal favorite scene. Some stuff didn't make sense and you have to allow yourself to just relax and be entertained and go with it.The FX I've heard a lot of positives and negatives comments. Personally for me I was lukewarm  nothing new that wowed me but nothing that felt overly fake looking to me. Despite reading some comments this was nothing near as bad as a scifi channel movie and many of the other typical horror films. In addition the film did not feel one bit claustrophobic. I hate indies where the locations are just one room or two. This was everywhere and it was quite enjoyable. Some of the scenery was really pretty and epic looking like the wideshot of the cornfield and the bridge so they got some really nice shots from whatever locations used.I knew I recognized the bad guy from somewhere but it was not until someone told me he was chucky that it stuck together. But he was fantastic. The rest of the acting was okay but no worse and no better then any other horror film. That's the other thing I wouldn't even call it horror. I don't know why they promote it as that as its simply not true well except maybe towards the end. But its much more like an action quest film of sorts with the baddies being zombies instead of say whatever. What gives it the most points for me are originality. I haven't quite seen anything like this before. What hurt it was lack of budget. It was apparent they didn't have much to work with. But We all had fun with it and never felt bored. The last part of the film is pretty intense and we all got into that. So I thought it was fun but I wasn't expecting Schindler's List either. Its a frickin' zombie film for crying out loud. Of course its not gonna win any Oscars. I love that genre and support by all means. That being said there were still some issues. Some of the scenes like the beginning with Sarah and mom fighting felt fake. They could have just cut that whole scene out. I didn't care so much about how the zombies were raised they could have cut that shorter and just focused more on slicing and dicing zombies.I pretty much got what I expected from the trailer and that says a lot since I won't go on about the misleading Sucker Punch and we did start to watch Monsters and got bored with that one. We saw a zombies being hacked to death indie film filled with lotsa action and lousy acting and loved it.".

We almost didn't watch it had it not been for the previews showing more then just zombies eating people. But the film started out kinda weird and we only started paying attention to it after the two teens make a run into the fields. But by towards the end of the film we were all hooked with eyes fixed to it. There was like no actors any of us knew but it didn't bother us as the baddie was really cool and we all liked the Gothic style of the film.We got a little confused with the flashback scenes and didn't understand why the dude in the past was suddenly here now but then again we weren't 100 focused. Anyways afterward I watched it again alone and it made a lot more sense the second time around. I love all the variety of locations the film takes place in especially the cornfields. But there were some really cool parts that grabbed us and almost felt like an anime like walking against a huge moon and the attic scene where all these lightrays come in. The zombies looked really cool and original. And we totally loved wraphead chick who touches things and weird black veins seem to sprout out. She should have been the main bad guy in our opinions just because of the coolness factor. The lead guy looked pretty cool with the whole dark mysterious thing and the sword as weapon of choice. Some scenes actually reminded me of my summers hanging out in the fields and under bridges. Just the feeling has a very innocent quality to it. My only gripes are the ending tends to get all bloody and there was one scene we just couldn't watch when girlfriend beats her mom's head in. Also I wish there had been a little bit more of a romance between the two teens and less scenes of the flashback with the artist guy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film a couple hours ago and decided to come back and write a review on it. I have to say after thinking about it it wasn't half bad. Let me preface this by saying also I just finished the indie film Monsters and was really disappointed. I mean it felt like a major disappointment because of the fact that there weren't any monsters in the film until the very ending. But this had tons of zombies everywhere. I really felt the town was overrun with them and I got the sense of dread. I am also somewhat lenient towards it because its an independent film with probably not much of a budget. For what it was I was impressed. WriterDirector Brian A. Metcalf managed to give a little bit of originality to the tired zombie genre even though it seems vastly overplayed nowadays but still stayed true to the genre with the you get bitten you turn into one phase.I love that this was vastly different than Twilight despite hearing comments that it was nothing more then one. This went places other films wouldn't such as hacking the mom in the head with the firepoker. But it didn't show blood just for the sake of showing it. Nor did random characters just pop up to then be hacked to death.Also Brad Dourif was a super high point for me that man can act! And this was one of his best looking characters in a long time. Okay the rest of the cast wasn't great in acting. I also highly wonder why they went with the girl as a choice. She ended up being really annoying whiny and with a high pitch voice. But Jaocb didn't bother me so much as he was playing the action role with the sword. The lady who played Maggie did quite well because I believed her as both a young mom and older mom in the present. Dialogue could have been better at times.I did feel the effects weren't bad and a step better than SyFy type effects as nothing was too cheesy to me. I absolutely loved the malyne character and the veins that get created whenever she touches something and there were some really pretty skies in the film. Also the sheer amount of fx in this movie were mindblowing as it seemed filled with them. But there was a huge discrepancy between these epic scenes underground to these common scenes in mom's house.The pace quickly picks up in the last minus the typical damsel in distress situation and it gets really interesting.I understand what Brian was trying to achieve but he seemed to lack the proper budget to pull it off on such a grand scale. Overall a very entertaining indie flick and a step above Syfy level but not a 300.".

Chucky because you don't mess with my boy! 3. pretty much all action 4. Love the beat your mom in with a fire poker scene  intense! 5. The hot chick that rots everything she touches 6. Cool fx  yeah I read all the comments and I thought so. Loved the veins from the chick and the legs cut off and other stuff. 7. The fact that its a fantasyhorroraction in one and I never got bored.I hate 1. The boring flashback story  minus the killing of the drunk dude that was kinda cool and again refer back to item no. 5 on the love section. They should have focused all attention to zombie hacking. I also hate narration. They had stuff like today I picked my nose guess it wasn't too bad a day overall. 2. I could care a less about mom and daughter making up although if they made out that would've been cooler However that being said it made item 4 on the love section even better later so very smart thinking there! 3. hated the gay twilight wannabe romance although I am happy to say there is less than I expected from the trailers 4. hated the lead chick needed to be hotter 5. wish there were more hot chicks 6. Although he kicked some serious butt the chuck still got messed with not cool in my book. 7. Acting dudes couldn't you have tried maybe a little harder? Maybe just a little bit? Like that's really the best you could have done?So I love it and hate it all at once. It did make me cheer in some scenes and I got into it at points so yeah watch if you wanna be entertained. Recap dudes The scenes in the present with the hacking the zombies were just dope and wish there had been more. The style had a clive barker thing going on which I lvoed. The past flashbacks coulda been avoided.I gave it 7 out of 10 because I loved 70 percent of the film. the other 30 percent could blown me.".

Recap dudes The scenes in the present with the hacking the zombies were just dope and wish there had been more. The style had a clive barker thing going on which I lvoed. The past flashbacks coulda been avoided.I gave it 7 out of 10 because I loved 70 percent of the film. the other 30 percent could blown me.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit that after seeing the first five minutes of this movie I was pretty sure where this was going. Oh you know the usual story of a man moving into a creepy old mansion weird things happening as he slowly loses his mind. But wow was I fooled. About ten minutes in something happens that throws this story into not only a completely different direction but arguably into a different subgenre of horror movie. Now that is no small feat. And while with this new story direction it eventually falls into more comfortable trappings of a familiar plot line Fading of the Cries manages to keep the viewer entertained as it moves at a brisk pace. We meet Michael Thomas Ian Nicholas of American Pie in the opening scene where he arrives at his new home. Sure it's large and foreboding and he got it at a cheap price but after the sudden death of his wife and daughter maybe this is what he needs. After all his sister is close by for support and his publisher feels this is just what the doctor ordered as far as getting his head back into his unfinished novel. Cut to fourteen years later where we meet his young niece Sarah. She is your typical troubled teen who hates her mom and just wants to do things her way. While in her room she rediscovers the ancient necklace that was given to her by her Uncle Michael. She promptly puts it around her neck grabs a bottle of booze and heads out the door. It isn't long before she meets up with one of her friends in front said Uncle's creepy old mansion. He has since passed on but the trip down memory lane is cut short by well to say more would ruin the surprise. Let's just say I didn't see it coming. I will say that she is rescued by a young man named Jacob who just happens to be very handy with a sword. And thank heavens for that because he is going to be using it again and again and again. The two just manage to escape and we quickly find out who is behind all of the madness. Just a super evil guy named Mathias played by veteran character actor Brad Dourif. And wouldn't you know all he wants is that ancient necklace back the one he claims was stolen from him by Michael. But Sarah ain't budging. It's going to take more than threatening words for her to relinquish it. Fading of the Cries is a solid movie that actually manages to mix several subgenres of horror without it feeling like a complete mishmash. Credit writerdirector Brian Metcalf for delivering a fresh take on a familiar plot. The acting is what it is for this type of fare but it's a horroraction movie so it hits my palate for what I'm paying to see.. Fun to see Thomas Ian Nicholas as Michael I actually remember him as the star from Rookie Of The Year the man who slowly finds himself overwhelmed by a mysterious journal found under the floorboards. The special effects are okay for the budget and the gore ample enough without being overboard. The fight scenes are actually very well choreographed and well done. You won't find any cheap quick camera cuts here and that is a blessing. Sure some parts of the movie are hokey but there is enough here to overcome them. The best part by far are the action sequences as the pacing is great. Just when I get bored with some of the small town storyline I'm put right back on the edge of my seat with some epic fight sequences.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the film this weekend. Had to give my own review after reading every single review here.My bottom line everyone is far too biased on both ends. This is not the worst movie in the world deserving 1 star as I've seen countless worse and I think you guys have either bones to pick like to just thrash others or are disgruntled movie wannabees like me but I'm honest and going to school for this thing. On the flip side it is not the greatest movie either as I've seen better as you guys are serious zombiefags or dating someone on the film.To me it stands pretty darn near the middle as there are both good and bad things to this movie. I don't have bones to pick nor relationships with any film members so you get the whole truth and nothing but the truth from me.My categories Storyconcept the story idea is pretty good. It did stand out as original and all of the characters did seem to have purpose. I give extra points for this on the sheer fact of not being overly recycled and a remake. There was actually more of a story than I expected. I guess from the trailers I expected the two leads running through an obstacle course of things only. There were some clich moments like having to go save the damsel in distress and all and defeating the badguy but thats in every film.Acting This is the superouch department. And I feel bad for the filmmakers because this film could have been good had the actors been decent. The two leads were terrible. Both bothered me in ways that I couldn't get over. Sarah has the most annoying voice that irritated me and Jacob reminded me of a stiff monologue wood. Their dialogue was terrible and there was no chemistry between the two leads. Anyone stating that they were decent or good are simply lying. Go back to acting school. I'm giving this part 3 stars out of 10 only because of Brad Dourif who cries and shoots snot and really goes medieval on some teens here otherwise this would have been a 2 or 1 as the rest were as bad as any Friday the 13th.Directing  So I guess this is director Brian A. Metcalf's first official film. It wasn't a bad first attempt as there were some very beautiful shots that come to mind. But he lost points because he should have definitely paid more attention to how the actors acted or maybe they were under time crunches or sadly he should have chosen better actors again the two leads being most crucial. But there were some really nice angles and great wideshots.visual effects  I have read more comments on this topic for this film for some reason than any independent film ever. To be harping on them this much is stupid. I read some people bash the fx to such a degree I wonder if there is some disgruntled fx artists here doing this. They were fine and they weren't as bad as Syfy or made for TV and they weren't as good as 300. It was a midgrade hybrid to me. Not mindblowing but not bad either and there was a sheer amount of them. I have also seen a lot of movies where they take me out of the story.Final Execution 4 This went downhill fast largely to the lousy acting and non believability of some of the actors. The story was just far too epic on such a tiny budget. A lot was done well but some of the sets were lousy the makeup of the weird monster creature bugged me and the wardrobe was horrible. Some of the dialogue felt way off but again I strongly blame the lousy actors in this film. Music was nice and fx were nice.Final thoughts The idea was good but execution fell short due to budget and acting. The beginning of the film was a little difficult to get through and there is no feeling of chemistry with our leads. None whatsoever. Still it was okay to watch and felt like a Schwarzenegger film where you watch simply for the action because the pacing was excellent. Visuals were pretty to stare at. I would have given much higher grade if the actors had been replaced with real actors. Okay Brad can stay the rest of ya especially you leads gotta go. I would love to see this film remade yes I said remake with a bigger budget and real actors on board.My final grade is 5. Those of you claiming it was the worst film or the best film are full of crap. Entertaining to a degree but with annoying parts. I've seen worse and better and so have you.".

THe best acting was by Brad Dourif though he is always good. The story is somewhat original at least i have not seen another movie with it in before. It is also one that i wouldn't mind letting my 12  year old child watch because it really isn't that scary but more fantasy. I would definitely watch this one again. It does get a bit confusing at times but it seems to tie everything up in a neat little bundle at the end. The ending does leave you hanging a bit though and make you wonder just what is going to happen next. Maybe a part 2 in the future?".

Part of the film felt sort of like a Twilight movie but goes into ultra violence towards the end of the film. There is a really touching scene of daughter reuniting with her mom only later to have to tear into her face with a firepoker which happens to be the most intense scene of the film. I really felt this film was almost a coming of age movie with really pretty landscapes and serene moments throughout which gives it even more of an eerie presence. There's also a scene that reminds me of children of the corn which I thought was fun too. The story was really something new and I quite admired that.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the movie tonight and enjoyed it a lot so here's my take Pro's Good special effects especially for a horror movie. Excellent hour and and a half and more more specifically great pacing especially the last 20 or so minutes which are rewind material.. Good combination of humor action and gore I'd say there's far more action though the vfx and action sequences alone are some of the most ambitious I have seen in years and there are some momentary comedic relief scenes like Makenzie Rosman's use of adult language such a contrast to seeing her as Ruthie in Seventh Heaven. The use of gore in this movie is just enough to wet the palate of any true genre fan the last scenes with Sarah killing her own mother when she turns is freakishly impossible not to watch. The new actor Jordan Matthews is beyond convincing as one of the next possible action heroes as there are far better and more convincing action sequences here than even a movie like Blade. For once we have a young actor who isn't afraid to get hurt beat up and bloodied. Great performance by genre fave Brad Dourif as to be expected. Cons There could have been stronger story plot and character development so that we got to know a more in depth storyline maybe it's set up as though we are to discover this in the sequels as the ending most definitely lends itself to insinuating a continued storyline. Also we basically jump right into the action within the first five minutes of the film so there isn't much time to set up the storyline some of this is made up for in the flash back sequences. Also some of the scenes are so epic that they make an unusual contrast to some of the day scenes in the town. Overall this is a great popcorn flick.".

Overly pointless bloody films of undead zombies eating people while being shot in the head by a group of survivors. So this came as a surprise when my boyfriend made me watch it with him. It starts out in some average town in Idaho or something where some girl goes to meet her friend. They do some drinking and then are attacked by the zombies. So at first I was like here we go but almost instantly this guy comes and and saves her using a sword as his weapon and slices them up. Then the sword like soaks up the blood or something like that. Anyways then the two are running through the streets when suddenly you see tons of people being attacked. Well the two make a narrow escape and into the fields where they see a church in the distance. The film then cuts to some guy puffing cigarettes writing in a journal about his stay in some house that seems to be the center of the film. Anyways we cut to inside the church after hacking arms and legs and heads off of zombies. Anyways like inside is some other zombie monster ghost or something that attacks them and thengets in a fight with the hero and jumps out the wall bringing in monster bats. The two again escape to this huge labyrinth underground where they meet some scary old dude that wants his necklace back. Soon they are attacked by hundreds of underground zombies that seem to appear out of nowhere. They run down this huge cave and then climb walls and onto the fields. At the same time some mom and daughter which we find out is related to the main girl are like trying to like escape the zombies and run up some hatch. Well anyways to make a long story short and after going over bridges and through cornfields with rabid crows and stuff the guy gets the girl home when the other sister is taken. So the hero goes after her but not before taking on a thousand of these zombies with alone. He gets in the house and kills the badguys and gets the girl out.It was fun to watch. I like seeing characters that I can relate to and I thought the girl was pretty cool. I also recognize the one girl from The SEcret Life of the American Teenager and she looks really young in this. Other than that I don't recognize anyone else.I didn't understand a few things like the guy being dead or spells or why he could or couldn't be hurt. I also did not like how the one girl died either at the end but I really got scared at a few moments. But it was a really fast film and never got boring. The fighting was cool to watch and it reminded me of a quest type of film. So there it is ".

The production values were pretty frickin' good for an indie since I was expecting SyFy channel quality but thought it was better. The acting was to be what one would expect for a film in this genre with teens with little to no acting experience and there were no recognizable actors in the film at all. The best part was the story. But the execution didn't come off quite as well. I thought it was the first original film I had seen in a very long time. It really kept me interested and I liked the fact that there were so many zombies in this movie. I was a little nervous at first because it takes place in some small town and I was afraid there wouldn't be enough but there were so many everywhere. Also the small town feel was greatly escalated from the scenes underneath the shack. The ending  it really shocked me and I loved it!! I was so surprised to see Jacob turn the tide on badguy with long hair can't pronounce his name and to show that he has evil in him as well when all is lost. The film did have some issues though. Some scenes felt really big scale while others felt small in nature. I wish I had known more about the backgrounds of some of the characters. But overall it was entertaining enough to keep me interested.".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading the board comments and reviews I decided to do my own review for this film since I've only been reading partial reviews and only a few that really go into much detail.The film starts off with a guy moving into a house as there is some crazy lightning storm going on. He is narrating the scene and discussing about moving in will give him a new start. Then it cuts to 13 years later and some mom and girl are arguing in the attic while about her going to visit her friend. Honestly after the first few minutes of the film I was starting to get nervous. This is probably partly due to the annoying ways of the girl playing Sarah. But then she goes to meet her friend and it picks up quite quickly from there. Her friend is attacked by zombies with big mouths that remind me from The Mummy. As she is about to meet her demise she is rescued by Jacob a hero that can kill zombies using his sword. The two escape and run through all kinds of obstacles. While this is happening Sarah's sister and mom are struggling alone to survive as the zombies are sprouted all over the place.At the same time we see the guy from the beginning in flashbacks start to go insane. These flashbacks show how brad and all his little demons are raised. I actually thought seeing him go from semi normal to deteriorate to weirdo was pretty cool. Also I love the tie in with a young Sarah and mom who are also in the present.The film goes into an explosive showdown with Jacob fighting tons and tons of zombies all by himself until he reaches the mansion to fight the other demons and eventually Brad. This movie sorta reminds me of a video game where you have to defeat certain bosses and at the end is Brad the main archnemesis who also wields a sword but is better at using it than Jacob. In this Brad looks pretty cool without the mustache he's been sporting around and looks like sorta a mix between his role as Grima Wormtongue and Chucky when he was human.I give it points for having an original storyline amongst a generation of remakes and rehashed material. There are some things I could do without too. I felt it could have focused slightly more on the now and less on the flashbacks. The fx that is constantly talked about were very good for an independent film considering I've seen worse. They are better than a Syfy movie but can't match the big blockbusters. But there are a lot of fx in this film. I mean a lot so points for that. But the other downside was some scenes were just grand in scope and then we return to small rooms in the house. So the consistency wasn't quite there. I also give it points for the pacing as the last third of the film is all action. Dialogue could have used some work and some of the acting wasn't so great minus an always spectacular bradchucky.Overall I did find it quite entertaining and recommend it to anyone who wants to just chill out and have fun and it had a good payoff especially for an indie film. But if you go in expecting a huge Zack Snyder 300 film you're gonna be disappointed.".

The acting could have been better but it's decent enough to carry the movie. Think Tomb Raider! This movie has action funny moments weird lines from Mackenzie Rosman of 7th Heaven...who would of thought intense moments insane violence with blood and gore with a cool hero that comes off better than Statham in The Expendables in parts. something I never expected from all of the talk about Harry Potter and Twilight just anything you want in an action movie fast forward through the small town parts! Most critics are giving this film negative reviews on but this movie is mostly for the fans action and genre lovers. Bottom line very good action packed action movie the is entertaining and good fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "I read all the mixed reviews saw the trailer decided to check out the film and give my own critique of the film. My first pet peeve is reading people saying they only watched 20 minutes of the film and then they decide to do a review. To me they lose the right to be reviewing it then. Those giving the film ratings of 1s and 10s are not being completely honest as I've seen worse and better which makes me feel there is clearly a lot of biased opinions both ways. Those giving 1s must have some kind of bone to pick or have simply not watched enough movies. Those giving 10s are probably cast members.I will admit I enjoyed watching the film to a certain extent with all the action scenes and all action. There are however two large flaws to it. The first is that the acting is horrendous. Jacob is played by Jordan Matthews and he appears to lack any acting talent. My girlfriend and I could not stop laughing at the way he delivered some of his lines actually most of them. But it doesn't stop there. Sarah is played by Hallee Hirsh and is very whiny in this film. Her acting doesn't seem to kick in until the final act where she has to beat her mom to death with a metal pole. It's almost like they didn't even try. The only saving graces are actors Brad Dourif and Thomas Ian Nicholas who seem to be the most seasoned actors in the film. I would have rated this film way higher if not for the acting. The second thing was the action started almost too fast. I am a huge lover of action films but the problem is we never get to go on that ride with them in the same way because we don't seem to care about the characters as much.Now that the bad stuff is out of the way I think the story is quite interesting although it leaves just as many questions as it answers. I LOVED the ending which I found to be quite shocking as we see Jacob turn bad and go ballistic on Matteus as he seems to become him. It ends in not the typical vain as one would expect which I quite enjoyed and it seems most studios would prefer a more cheery ending.I also thought the story of Michael was actually more fascinating than the story of Jacob again probably due to the acting. I also thought how the two stories from the past and present come together worked out nicely although I still am not completely clear what the deal with Jacob is. He appears to be some sort of spell raised about by Nicholas's character and sent to protect his niece Sarah. The rest can go to hell it seems until Jacob is asked to go protect younger sister Jill.There are things I would have changed like distinguishing the past and present more and the better actors but the film is not bad for entertainment purposes especially if you can get past the bad acting. Visually I thought it was really nicely done and I thought the story was a grade better than a typical slasher. I would have given it a 5 but because its an independent lowbudget Bfilm I'll give it a 5 12 which I did round to 6. I can only imagine what this film could have been with a larger budget and better cast like Joseph GordonLevitt as Jacob Emma Roberts as Sarah and Michael Fassbender playing Matteus.".

The Pro's are that it is in English and does not require subtitles. The background music is tolerable. The credits were displayed in an attractive font. The actors appear to know their lines and the crew members do not walk into the scenes.Aside from that this film is about as bad as you can get without being so bad that it is funny in an ironic way.Don't waste your time.

The movie starts right in with the action and slows down shortly in the middle only to really pick up at the last third of the film. I did like how there has been nothing quite like this that I've seen before.I don't think that there will be enough blood for the diehard romero gore fans. For the Twihards there isn't enough romance. Fpr the heavy film buffs and critics the acting isn't quite there. For those into special computer effects they aren't bad but nothing groundbreaking that I haven't seen before although I really liked the masked guy turning into crows.So why did I give this a 7 rating? I enjoyed it because I wasn't expecting a romance or a bloody horror. I got an entertaining action fantasy which led to a satisfying ending. It was very fast and gave me a fun experience. But what really impressed me is that they were able to do so much for an independent film.I recommend you watch it and draw your own conclusions. The largest issue for some I think may be that this film crosses so many genres. So depending on what your expectations are will determine how you feel.

	schema:reviewBody "I was initially unsure about some of the cast. I've only seen Thomas Ian Nicholas do comedies I've never seen the actress who played Sarah but have looked her up to find mostly TV credits. The lead actor who played Jacob was apparently an unknown theater actor from New York but I wasn't sure if he was just going to be another pretty boy from my first view of the trailer. New York theater is the highest credential an actor can have but you never know. All the big young actors today have zero acting credibility and I'm always looking for the next Johnny Depp or Leonardo DiCaprio. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised as you usually don't see new young actors take on roles where they get bloodied up and ugly.What sold me on the movie was the superhero action. I'd say the last 20 to 25 minutes of the film are the most entertaining in an edge of your seat kind of way. The battle between Jacob and Mathias at the very end was the best part followed every so closely by the scene of Jacob taking on the onslaught of zombies just beforehand. The rest of the acting was kind of weak but no different than a movie like Cloverfield Halloween or Friday the 13th. The movie was much better than the Nightmare On Elm Street remake but the storyline itself was confusing at times. There was a lot of cutting back between the small town parts which I thought were boring and the more epic action scenes. The only cool part of the town scenes was watching Sarah hack away at Maggie's face when she turns into a zombie.The pacing was great and Brad Douirf had some sinister moments on screen. I first had the impression that he was playing another Grima Wormtongue role. But Mathias is a more commanding character and it's the lead bad. Grima was just a bit part. Overall a cool film with some cool new characters. My favorite character was Jacob because of the blood and you don't see enough heroes with swords these days we're too often overexposed to gun use maybe the NRA has a deal with the movie industry.".

The refreshingly unbearable scares the magnificent aweinspiring effects the Paul Verhovenesque completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore the almost uniquely unHollywood ending and twist with it characters It's all there What is even more amazing about this movie is that it's creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like pried from your decaying flesh and the disgusting gore that leaves me wanting more with mangled faces sound effects galore with zombie bites and sword slashes. I feel right at home watching this. Brad Dourif is easily the second best thing in the movie second only to the fast moving constantly multiplying zombies that attack our hero. But let me tell you this is not a lame crappy hero I expected to see. This guy gets beats up bloodied and hurt. No clich here. No stupid way too prettied up characters. I'm an instant fan. Since we all have limited attention spans and I'm mindful of not giving too much away about what happens in the move I'll wrap up by saying that those of you out there who enjoy films like Underworld Dawn Of The Dead Resident Evil etc. will undeniably love this film and watch it over and over again. It's an instant cult classic.. And even if the above are not representatives of your particular favourite genre consider this. I saw this with a friend of mine who stated before the opening sequence 'I don't know why I'm bothering I hate rubbish like this'. He was the one jumping out of his skin as the credit rolled and we both walked away saying 'how many Oscars has this been nominated for'..? Sarcastically  yes but a damn good film The only thing that could have made it better was more zombie fights.

No all they needed was a reason for some good old steak and potatoes action and a star to anchor it all. 2012's Jack Reacher has these qualities in spades.Maybe this won't appeal to the eGeneration who need to have their senses constantly bombarded but for the rest of us Jack Reacher is a solid bit of retrorefreshment.".

I don't believe there is any CGI in this movie at all! Amazing! Very old school very surprising very well done. I loved it and haven't seen a movie of this type that I enjoyed in a long long time. I loved the way it ended... Fairly easy to see through the plot and figure out what is going on but still very enjoyable. This is a MUST see for anyone who loved the Dirty Harry movies or ones similar. Minimal fluff no stupid romance a believable plot and a good car chase. And bad guys killed the way they should be.

Great plot. Creepy bad guy and a reasonable amount of suspense. I have never read the Jack Reacher books so cannot compare Cruise to the title character. I imagine that some people might have been disappointed at the lack of huge explosions and transforming robots etc etc but this was a fine old school action thriller with many new tricks which i haven't seen before check the buss stop scene. Classic!. I loved the pacing and the great interaction between players. Sure some of the one liners seemed a tad forced but they were not so common. Well done Cruise again.Do yourselves a favour.

	schema:headline " JACK REACHER Action moviemaking done right!";
	schema:reviewBody "Saw JACK REACHER on Monday night at an advance screening. Here's some of my thoughts. There are no spoilers.First off I'd say I agree with the general critical reception 45 stars. To me that means it's a solid movie that delivers at the high end of its genre. JACK REACHER isn't trying to be anything revolutionary it's more the kind of action thriller audiences haven't seen for a while.This isn't MISSION IMPOSSIBLE or even James Bond. Writerdirector Christopher McQuarrie takes his inspiration from action movies of the late 60searly 70s like DIRTY HARRY which has been name checked in a couple reviews already BULLITT for the car chase and maybe another Don Siegel movie CHARLEY VARRICK. The excitement here doesn't come from over the top stunts or huge explosions. Like the action movies just referenced you thrill to watching a strongly defined protagonist outsmart outfight and outmaneuver the bad guys.Which brings me to the character of Jack Reacher and the casting of Tom Cruise. In the series of novels by Lee Child this movie is based on Jack Reacher is an exMP detective. After a lifetime spent on military bases overseas he lives as a drifter in the United States who adheres to a life of zero commitments No house no job no car no possessions no family. Oh and he stands 6'5 and weighs 250 lbs.Clearly Tom Cruise doesn't match that physical description. What makes Reacher such a great character in Child's books though has far less to do with his exterior than it does with his intellect. If you've read the series as I have it's a little strange at first. As the film played out however I got more relaxed and more into it. This was definitely a movie about Lee Child's hero Jack Reacher physical differences be damned.Would I have preferred an unknown actor closer to Child's description to play Reacher on screen? Yes of course. But I could say that about virtually any character and often do. I generally want unknowns for everything.Which is where Cruise's casting comes in handy a bit. Because his casting sort of guarantees a certain amount of box office it means the filmmakers can take more chances. Like crafting an action movie that's longer on character and occasional brutal violence and short on mindless action and impossible nonsense.JACK REACHER was a very satisfying action thriller for me. I felt it captured what I love about Lee Child's thrillers and Jack Reacher in particular. I'd definitely recommend it and I'm going to see it in the theater again. That's for damn sure.".

Tom Cruise did a great job in his typical role. The rest of the supporting cast was solid enough and the cameo by Robert Duvall was awesome. The plot developed really well and made it more of a thinking movie than I anticipated. That being said the turns in the plot kept the film from becoming stagnant or boring and the action sequences felt real and authentic. I wasn't a huge fan of some of the cinematic elements and there were some flaws in one of the plot twists but nothing that really hurt the moviewatching experience.

	schema:reviewBody "James Barr Joseph Sikora a former military sniper is in jail for killing 5people and says he is innocent. He asks for exArmy MP Officer Jack Reacher Tom Cruise. But Reacher knew Barr in Iraq and is out to prove him guilty. Hmmmshould be a slam dunk.It's not often that we get a good thriller along with a good mystery as well but that is what we have here. Why would Barr ask for Jack Reacher if Reacher knew what Barr did in Iraq? Also what was the purpose of Barr killing 5people who had no connection to each other? Assistant DA Helen Rosamund Pike asks Reacher to help prevent Barr from getting the death penalty. But we also had some good fight scenes and an exciting car chase. Let the games begin. This gets somewhat talky in the beginning as Helen and Reacher analyze what had happened. But we hang on every word because we too need to know things. All this sounded like the dialogue was dubbed in but I think the microphones were just too close to the characters and this made it seem as if the dialogue was dubbed in. To be honest it did look like Rosamund Pike had weak knees around Tom Cruise but the script wouldn't go here. It just looked that way to me. The supporting cast of bad guys was good as was Detective Emerson David Oyelowo assigned to the Barr case. Robert Duvall comes in as a retired USMC Gunnery Sgt Gunny Cash who does a masterful job as the owner of a gun range and inserts some humor as he deals with Reacher. Over all this was very good. But I did have the feeling something was missing. Maybe it needed a better ending as this one was kind of weak for such a good story. Maybe Tom Cruise is leaving his Mission Impossible movies behind and is now centering on another action hero Jack Reacher who is described as someone who seems to only wear the clothes on his back doesn't care about the law and is only concerned with one thing justice and the way he goes about achieving it may shock you. Hey Lee Child the author of the Jack Reacher series wrote about 15books. See? 810Violence Yes. Sex No. Nudity No. Language Yes not much".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Reacher Tom Cruise is the tale of a very astute exmilitary policeman. The army training came in quite handy as he digs into the evidence of a heinous crime that turns out to be not at all what it seems to be on the surface. I was surprised at how funny the dialogue in this film was it is definitely not a comedy but the sarcastic and comedic oneliners kept coming even in situations that were completely devoid of a humorous setting there was some very amusing conversation. There was even a scene in which Reacher is attacked in a bathroom that had me cracking up at the bumbling bad guys. The comedy was heightened even further with the old codger Cash Robert Duvall. Mr. Duvall always delivers a convincing performance same here. As with any film that features Mr. Cruise the expectation is that it will be fast paced and very entertaining same here. The only thing missing was his trademark sprint to or after something or anything. I've just come to expect to see him running really running but we are getting older. The trailer is the only kind that I like the ones that do not give away the whole movie. It shows that Reacher is bad a without playing out every aspect of the story. David Oyelowo Emerson is one to watch he is building an impressive resume and it is easy to see why because whenever he portrays a character he is that character. When he played a pilot in Red Tails I totally believed he could fly a plane. When he was the head of a company experimenting on Apes I was again thoroughly convinced and I believed every aspect of his being a police detective. One of the best car chase scenes that I've seen lately was in this film. There were so many attributes of this film that I liked including the sexual tension between Reacher and Helen Ronin Rosamund Pike that I will just sum it up by saying. Everything just seemed to be genuine and authentic even though I know that the fights are staged they looked logistically correct but Steven Segal did come to mind. I liked that the film had a legitimate beginning and end even if there are subsequent Jack Reacher tales to follow there was no gaping wide open door of a final scene leaving the audience wondering 'What's up with that?!?'. But I do hope there are sequels at least one. I give it a green light".

The film has a good twisting plot and Jack Reacher is a mix between James Bond and John McLane from Die Hard. There are some memorable characters and the film draws you in and makes you think. The plot is easy to follow but complex enough to keep you interested without giving you brain ache. In short I liked Jack Reacher and look forward to more films with Jack. The plot has plenty of fast action scenes which are thankfully not too over the top and keep the pace of the film going. The ending was also well thought out despite the slightly cheesy last few lines. But they do leave the character ready for follow up films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw Jack Reacher. LOVED IT! I thought it was great. There was a lot of action but it had some great comic relief. Jack Reacher's interaction with everyone bordered heavily on comic relief. There is a scene when Jack Reacher Tom Cruise is in his hotel room with Helen Rodin Rosamund Pike and she asks him to put his shirt on but he says he only has one. Several minutes later he says it's late and they should get some sleep Helen mistaken thinks that he is suggesting they sleep together and then realizes her mistake. The whole interaction is very funny but delivered in a straight faced manner at least on the part of Jack Reacher. Many of Jack Reacher's other encounters throughout the movie are along the same lines as this. The uncomfortable interactions between Reacher and Sandy played by Alexia Fast are particularly amusing as all he wants is information and she keeps offering herself to him. After Sandy is killed and Helen is kidnapped the comic relief is done.All this talk about comic relief by no means refers to the first ten minutes of the movie. A sniper sets up across the river from PNC Park in Pittsburgh and kills six people. The act is believed to be done by James Barr played by Joseph Sikora a former Army Sniper. He is arrested and in interrogation he writes one thing... Find Jack Reacher! When Reacher arrives in Pittsburgh Barr has been beaten to the point of being in a coma.That is all I will say about this movie as far as the plot. I give this a vote of 9 out of 10. Tom Cruise should think of making the other Jack Reacher books into movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Reacher is based on Lee Child's book One Shot. For those who've read it you already know Tom Cruise isn't right for the role. One would wish they could've gotten a bigger and taller actor to play the role like Hugh Jackman or Chris Evans or someone else. It could have been a new iconic appearance for a hero. The real problem is it seems Tom Cruise is just redoing his generic action hero performance. As much as he refuses to call himself a hero he still looks like one but in a much glossier way. In spite of that the film itself is a snazzy piece of entertainment that is rare in cinema these days. A neonoir styled action blockbuster that will grip you by its storytelling and its action scenes. There's a chance that could have made this a much better film but put aside those complains it's still pretty awesome.The film begins with a man shooting five random innocent people. It effectively builds tension by being silent. The rest of the movie is as slick as the opening and it serves a great entertainment. The only disappointment is Tom Cruise. He may not have the appearance of the character but he could have done a lot more than just doing his typical action hero swagger. He sure has charisma but that's all. His fans might still think he's pretty cool for it. I'm not a fan of comparing a book to its film adaptation. I never cared if a single plot point or character was changed but the Jack Reacher character is the real deal here. It seems this film is only made for Cruise to get him back in action. Well this character is not for him.The film is still solidly made. At least it doesn't go to the modern generic action movie direction that is relentlessly loud but sticks to the neonoir storytelling. The best parts is when it spends time in scrutinizing the case in silence. When the film starts talking the dialogue is witty and interests the story's investigation. It gets exciting when it goes to the action. The action scenes are well shot. The handtohand combat fight scenes reminiscence the cool eighties action with some humorous camp. The car chase is the most impressive sequence where it shows several angles as they drive away without shaking the camera. It has the potential of a classic throwback.Jack Reacher is quite entertaining but again they should have gotten the right actor to play the lead. Jack Reacher here is nothing more than another Tom Cruise character with a leather jacket and do what this old man usually do. The only good thing is it's not bad. It's a decent kind of action thriller that isn't famous in mainstream cinema anymore but yet is enjoyable. It's not entirely an action film though but people might think it is. It leaves having a smart mystery in spite of fact it lacks the antihero. It's fun and worth watching but there are things that could have made this a lot more interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know nothing about the books so this review is based on the movie alone.I liked it more than I thought I would. This is not so much an action film as it is a thriller and a detective story. There certainly is action but it's not the core of this movie. There's a little conspiracy some character development when needed and of course the inevitable good vs. bad  confrontation in an expected manner. All of the main elements work quite well. Not exceptionally well but well enough to keep the film interesting intact and effective.I felt like I was watching a mixture of Dirty Harry Bourne and Taken possibly with a little Lethal Weapon thrown into the mix. And again I'm not talking about the amount of action just the overall feeling of resemblance I got. So it didn't feel too original but three things worked so well that Jack Reacher isn't just a mediocre movie 1 Christopher McQuarrie knows how to put a story on the screen as we know from Usual suspects. He knows when to further the storyline he knows when to give us a little breather. The story is coherent and moves along nicely. Just when you think you need an action scene you get it. You get some unexpected humor and nice details every once in a while and everything just seems to have its rightful place. This movie isn't deep and the script is not overly brilliant but it's handled very effectively and that is something I've grown to like because the opposite happens way too often in movies. Thumbs up to McQuarrie.2 This movie is wonderfully shot. Cinematography is very good and pleasing to the eye at all times and on top of that the action is shot very very well. It wasn't long ago when I watched Bourne supremacy again and I absolutely hated the unnecessarily shaky camera. Jack Reacher handles action perfectly. You can feel the chaos and the urgency in some scenes yet you're always aware of what's happening. This is the way I wan't to see action scenes shot be it a fight scene or a car chase we get both and they're very good. I would also like to compliment the satisfying violence. It does what it's supposed to do and looksfeels mean enough in a movie that warrants it. Of course I would've wanted an Rrated cut but I'm fairly pleased how things were handled.3 Tom Cruise. I can't help it. I absolutely love his work. He's just got that certain presence. When he stares when he talks when he throws a punch delivers some comic relief or pulls off some nice stuntwork  I'm usually sold. He's not especially impressive in this movie but him just being a professional himself is enough he carries this film when it needs it. I can nowadays keep my opinions of his religion at bay when I'm watching a movie. I even tried hating him at some point for some juvenile reason but every time I saw one of his better films Last Samurai Oblivion I was just thoroughly sold and entertained.Acting isn't crap otherwise either. Werner Herzog is always a fun guy to watch and Jai Courtney is decent still not seeing Die Hard 5 though. David Oyelowo is interesting Alexia Fast not too bad at all. Joseph Sikora has only a minor role but delivers a strong performance especially in the end. Robert Duvall nice seeing you too! I liked how almost every character was simplistic in a good way. No overly complicated motivations just the good old basics. Honorary mention goes to James Martin Kelly who plays a grieving father. Rosamund Pike's character left something to be desired. She is an important piece of the movie and sometimes I got the feeling that either the director wasn't really sure what to do with her or she just couldn't nail it. Sometimes she's smart sometimes a little clueless sometimes emotional and sometimes professional. I didn't get a good grip on her. I enjoyed her though especially in scenes shared by her and Cruise. Also it might be that she was the least simplistic character in this film and stood out in a weird way because of that.I really enjoyed watching this movie. It felt like it took a lot of good things while leaving bad things alone from 70's 80's and 90's action thrillers and made them modern again. There's also some fooling around with certain movie clichs in a funny way. Not a masterpiece with an Rrating a little more gripping story and a little more developed characters this could've been a modern classic for me but certainly a welcome good oldfashioned thriller with some action and humor on the side. Now excuse me while I put on my leather jacket borrow somebody's car and go tell some woman how to do her job.".

Soon he finds that the Barr is innocent and there is a conspiracy behind the murders where the apparent culprit is the scapegoat.Jack Reacher is an action movie better than I expected. The plot is intriguing but as usual the ego of Tom Cruise spoils the movie. There are unbearable scenes but maybe the worst scenes are Jack Reader going unarmed to face the gang of killers in the stone quarry and when he drops his weapon to fight against Charlie while Helen is prisoner of the bad guys. Then he easily executes The Zec in a lack of consistency in his behavior. Last but not the least Why not Gerard Butler in the lead role? My vote is six.Title Brazil Jack Reacher O ltimo Tiro Jack Reacher The Last Shot";

It holds you up with the crime investigation like all the other crime movies does. Its done with a better action stuffs and Cruise justified it very well as he always does. Pike looks amazing with her role and look as well. It doesn't have lots of twists in the tale but the investigation itself turns as it flows. Flaws were less unless you are a movie maniac to find one.I don't see any lagging or unwanted scenes. Everything just fits in so well. Each character are very much needed to the story line. I love it i bet you'd too.Recommended for all action lovers. 810 for this one.".

	schema:headline " A real let down for fans";
	schema:reviewBody "'One Shot' is my favourite book. Not my favourite Jack Reacher book. My favourite book. So when I heard they were not only going to be making a Reacher film but making 'One Shot' I was ecstatic. Then I heard who would be playing Reacher and like 99.9 of fans I thought to myself this must be an April Fool's joke. A 5'7 skinny guy playing the hulking 250 pound 6'5 Jack Reacher? This can't be happening. Sadly it was. And then the trailer came out and my worst fears were confirmed. Cruise was not being buffed up by any type of body suit he wasn't being made to look taller with trick photography and he wasn't putting on the raspy 'animallike' voice I always imagined Reacher to have.Lee Child once made a great analogy to Jack Reacher. He said does anyone remember the story lines in the Dirty Harry Movies? Not a chance. But they sure as hell remember the character. The Reacher books are about a single thing and that is Jack Reacher. Don't get me the wrong the stories in 90 of the books released so far are masterpieces and could easily be made into great films. But they still remain a vehicle for which Jack Reacher can thrive in. And the producers proved that they realised this albeit very late in the piece by renaming the movie 'Jack Reacher'. A little inyourface for my liking but I could see why it was necessary so I didn't hold it against them. However I did reserve my right to hold Tom Cruise's casting against them. And I was right to. Did Tom Cruise pull off the great character of Jack Reacher? Not in your life.Cruise was cast badly and then went on to play the role even worse. Not a great combination if you're an actor. Heath Ledger took the opposite route in his role as The Joker in Christopher Nolan's 2008 masterpiece The Dark Knight. He was hugely criticised for being completely wrong for the part when he was cast and we all know how that turned out. Cruise unfortunately did not rise to the challenge in the same way.For starters I'm reasonably confident he was the shortest person in the film. Not one effort was made to make him look the least bit impressive stature wise. His haircut was ridiculous. He looked like a guy who goes to the hair salon twice a week for touchups. In fact Jai Courtney in the role of the Charlie had what I always imagined to be the perfect haircut for Reacher. Perhaps he would've been better placed in the role? Cruise's shoulders were not broad enough. At one stage a character asks I'm looking for a guy who could kill a man with one punch? To which he is directed straight to Reacher. Get real. Rosamund Pike was probably more likely to kill someone that way than Cruise. Cruise did not alter his voice one bit for the movie. This was a huge disappointment for me. I had really hoped he would do something like what Christian Bale did when he was in the Batman suit only not quite to the same degree but for the whole movie. Cruise sounded almost feminine performing some of the lines. Lastly he kept bloody smiling or smirking whatever you want to call it. I was OK with him cracking the odd joke here and there because Reacher can be a bit of a smartass but he didn't have to look so damn proud of himself every time he did it. Reacher's an animal 247 he very rarely smiles and he takes life very seriously.The script was solid it stayed pretty faithful to the book. I found the jokes and oneliners a little too frequent for my liking and took away from what should have been a dark atmosphere. Unfortunately Reacher was never really challenged physically. Sure everyone he fought was bigger than him but that's only because Cruise is so short. Never once did I think to myself 'how's Reacher possibly going to take down this guy? Which always makes for the best fight scenes. One part of the script I did not like at all again regarding the 'bad guys' was when two of them whilst trying to attack Reacher were practically fighting each other even harder. And just because they wanted to get through the door first? I felt like I was watching 'Home Alone' or something. I assume they were going for comedic value but it just went far too far for my liking.The rest of the cast were solid at best in fact I found Rosamund Pike well below average in her performance but I wasn't too bothered by this because they were the epitome of a support cast. They weren't who people came to see. People came to see Cruise and he let them down. The interesting thing is that the movie isn't being panned across the board which is testament to how good the story is. It's a great story and could easily have been done without Reacher which is basically what has happened for people who haven't read the books. They don't have those to compare the character to and so they leave the theater quite happily. And that's great for them. But for the rest of us they have ruined a great character. I hope when I read future books I can still picture the character the same way I always have. Sadly I fear I may struggle.".

Aside from having a razor thin plot line which is entirely spelled out in the first 10 minutes of the movie the dialog is also painfully awful. About half of this movie seemed to be Tom Cruise having flashbacks of the killing which he didn't commit or witness which makes it all the weirder. The scene where he gets hit in the back of the head with a baseball bat and barely falls down is hilarious especially when the two attackers armed with a crowbar and baseball bat try to fit through the bathroom door at the same time and get stuck before being thwarted by the bathtub in their attempts to hit Tom Cruise who's head stays above the top of the tub the entire time. Of course there was the obligatory car chase scene where the cops who were right behind him all of a sudden lose him completely just before the suddenly catch back up to him. Not to mention the hilarity of the part where he leaves his car in drive steps out and walks over to a group of onlookers and pretends to be one of them. Then there is the scene where he's driving carelessly backwards using only the rearview camera to guide him while he reclines to avoid being shot until one of the bad guys shoots out the camera and he immediately backs the car on top of a rock where he gets stuck gee I wonder who saw that coming.

I was put off by the title at first the name seemed too theatrical so I didn't watch it until I had really nothing else to do but I was completely pleasantly surprised. The bad guys are realistically portrayed too. They are bad enough that you hope for their demise throughout the movie and like all good movies the bad guys get their comeuppance.

I was put off by the title at first the name seemed too theatrical so I didn't watch it until I had really nothing else to do but I was completely pleasantly surprised. The bad guys are realistically portrayed too. They are bad enough that you hope for their demise throughout the movie and like all good movies the bad guys get their comeuppance. Good work all around.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Jack Reacher";
	schema:reviewBody "Jack Reacher is written to be quite the physical giant so when Tom Cruise got interested in the character many would not have fathomed that Cruise himself would take the role although I felt it was probably one of the best ways to get author Lee Child's famous investigator onto the big screen by none other than one of the biggest stars Tinseltown has to offer. Written for the screen and directed by Christopher McQuarrie Jack Reacher the film based upon Child's book One Shot is a solid investigative drama dealing with a sensitive issue of today with a sniper's seemingly random shooting and you should know better than to trust the marketers on their treatment of this film.With Drop The Lime's State Trooper track pulsating with the Camaro's engine roar together with plenty of fisticuffs as thrown by Cruise's Reacher one will be forgiven to think that this is an action film thanks to the trailer. Granted there are action set pieces they are not the showcase of the movie. Instead it's quite old school in its treatment dead serious yet punctuated with moments of wry wit backed with a genuine whodunnit mystery. Like Cruise's other films in A Few Good Men and even The Firm his protagonist must uncover the mystery to why he's being called by the accused Barr Joseph Sikora whom everyone automatically thought he was a friend and to carefully navigate through murky waters with yet to be revealed villains adamant in sending him back to the shadows where he came from or to frame him up so that he's out of commission.But the best in the business aren't known as the best for nothing. Reluctantly hired by Barr's defence attorney Helen Rosamund Pike to become her investigator we follow Jack Reacher as he conducts the ABCs of investigations  assuming nothing believe nobody and checking everything. No stone got left unturned as McQuarrie's screenplay gets you hook line and sinker drawn deep into trying to unravel the Why and the Who involved in this relatively complex piece of intrigue and how it's pure bad luck that the antagonists have to grapple with Reacher's unique skillset which almost bordered on a parody of Taken when he gets in conversation with the bad guys.Reacher's modus operandi and investigative skills and techniques would be what will draw the crowds hungry for this genre of film. It's an investigative drama through and through with hypotheses and theories readily thrown up for deeper examination which some may be quick to dismiss as convenience but it's antagonist screwup mostly. These naturally introduce us to the supporting cast who aid or get in the way of Reacher's investigations and allows for the appearance of Robert Duvall whose charisma in a bit role just chews up the scenery. It's the story here that's engaging because there's zilch development character wise where we don't get to see how Reacher develops into the tough guy he is nor be bothered too much with it. Most times Tom Cruise just continued being Tom Cruise which is inevitable because little is done to try and get him behind the Jack Reacher persona but we're not complaining.For those who find investigative dramas a little bit dry there's no lack of action sequences that mattered with a few that stood out such as the very first time we see Reacher take on five thugs in SpiderManish style complete with very dark and wisecracks before putting his military training and background to good use. It's no nonsense and frankly quite methodical in his choice of martial arts going for the jugular or to inflict massive pain to demoralize opponents than to waste time horsing around. Then of course there's the finale which mixed things up a lot to offer action fans a buffet of experiences combining sniper with melee firearms and martial arts with some selfdeprecating downoutofluck moments.Despite having Rosamund Pike as the female lead there's little romance thrown up in the story unlike most other Hollywood films of such nature. Pike's presence as Helen the attorney felt nothing more than a little plot necessity in having to reach into Jack Reacher's thought process and allow him someone with whom he can debate and bounce ideas off versus having to talk to himself or worse for a movie talk to nobody or having a narration throughout. It's a pity her character served as pretty much the mouthpiece of the conspiracy helping audiences piece stuff together in quite verbose terms when the need calls for it.Still I'm giving this a wholehearted recommendation with the likes of Richard Jenkins David Oyelowo and even director Wener Herzog himself lending star power to the film in a rare appearance as an actor. This may be the start of a promising franchise that Tom Cruise could be getting himself involved in and it certainly does enough as a first film introduction to the famous Lee Child character who will clearly garner more fans to pick up the books compare the film and literary versions and maybe devour the further adventures already available in print.".

Rarely do all these elements come together in one film but this is the case with La Otra Conquista.There is no need to belabor the narrative since so many others have done that here but even that is refreshing since I don't remember another film that looks at the conquest of this continent from the point of view of those who were here first. It is one of the few times they are not portrayed as a bunch of happy slappy childlike natives or murderin' savages out to rape the virginal white women.It is an amazing achievement in so many ways. After the years of struggle and the unbelievably huge obstacles in the path of  this dramatization of the last days of the great Aztec empire it's a wonder it was ever completed. It's almost as if forces were still even now trying to stamp out their history and their story. But despite the small budget the years of piecebypiece shooting and those who wanted the shameful dead past to stay dead La Otra Conquista was made.I am listening to the soundtrack as I write this and the music is as haunting as it was the first time I heard it. The theme that recurs throughout the film appears again and again sometimes sounding like a monks' plainsong sometimes like a sacred wise man's chant until finally it becomes a painful funereal dirge crying out for the lost past.  The music alone made the film worth seeing nothing like the voice of Placido Domingo to make people sit still and be quiet while the credits are rolling!I can only add this Unless you need your films dumb and lightweight and meaningless you owe it to yourself to see what was Mexico's biggest home grown hit in history and should have been that country's entry in the Academy Awards.

	schema:reviewBody "The Other Conquest  A Film for Generation The Other Conquest La Otra Conquista is a passionately directed written and edited film by Salvador Carrasco and produced by Alvero Domingo Placido's son. The story opens with the protagonist Topiltzin a blood relative of Emperor Moctezuma having just witnessed the gruesome massacre of Aztec nobility at the hands of Spanish Conquerors. We follow his life as he too is captured by Spanish soldiers. Topiltzin is forcibly converted into an order of Monks where he is renamed Tomas. Along the way he befriends Dona Isabel rightful also renamed daughter of Moctezuma. She has been converted and is being kept in marriage by Cortes. Isabel and Tomas depend upon each other secretly for spiritual survival and empathy. All the while they strive to keep their cultural flames alive by however means necessary.In his quest to unfold the beginnings of racism in Mexico today Carrasco captures the nuances of prejudice and whispers of colonial oppression that speak to today's LatinAmerican in the same way that The Crucible and Roots spoke to their respective audiences. Indeed much has been said concerning his astute reflection on today's society and at a recent screening Carrasco comments I know this is all still present because I see it. Carrasco Mexican born schooled at NYU and current resident of California is destined to become a prominent voice of Generation  the Latin GenX population. As defined by the New Times Magazine if you grew up knowing the words to the theme song of Three's Company AND Que Pasa USA? you're generation . Characterized by paradox and duality Carrasco is true to GenN in his eclectic vision score and central issues. So much so in fact those moments depicted in this 1520s art film ring poignantly true in my own modern day Newyorican experiences.For instance like many of my generation I was at first raised bilingually. But in kindergarten children with a Spanish surname were funneled into the bilingual program. It was a poorly concealed attempt to segregate the Latino children from the mainstream grouping us instead with the problem children. It didn't matter that most of us spoke English perfectly or that some of us didn't know Spanish at all. My mother fought itand she learned a valuable lesson in survival If your brown face and accented name weren't American enough your voice would have to be. And soI learned to speak Spanish many years later in a classroom with a direct view into expresident Nixon's living room window across the street. In this mostly White wellrespected parochial high school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan I was both proud and embarrassed to finally be speaking Spanish. One day as I sat in my itchy plaid skirt mindlessly repeating words and watching Nixon's Latina maid vacuum the second floor I was called upon to start the translation exercises. Where is the bus stop? Mrs. Hayne demanded. Caught off guard I blurted Donde se queda la parada de la guagua? Mrs. Hayne who had been educated in Spain scrunched her face in disgust. La guagua? Esa palabra es muy fea. Favor de usar el autobus.It was a thirty second exchange during an unremarkable class over fifteen years ago and yet remembering it still causes pangs of rage that I hadn't felt since. That is until I saw The Other Conquest.What set me off specifically was the scene during which a beautifully uniformed Dona Isabela sits at the garden bench with Topiltzin now successfully monkified. They chat in their native indigenous tongue until the Spanish guards appear within earshot. Then they stiffen their movements and switch to Spanish. Isabela is confronted by one of the guardsmen who comments I thought I heard barking. Mrs. Haines' scrunched up face flashed before me along with all of the mixed emotions I had felt on that day. And I felt better  someone understands.This film is froth with such resounding moments. Shortly thereafter Dona Isabela schools the guard on the functions of the liver in response to his illreferenced insult. She sites the organ as the seat of all passions which was a common belief held referenced by Shakespeare in The Tempest some hundred years after Isabela would have lived The guard was unfamiliar with this information. In the hard world of dual living the minority needs to know everything of their conqueror's culture though it never applies vice versa. This makes for an unexpected advantage on the part of the oppressed and therefore a threat. We recognize this as fear clouds the Guard's face when Isabela speaks and we as an audience know that she will suffer for her wits.This jarred memories of my days as a graduate student at the Universidad de Puerto Rico where I taught American Pronunciation. One of my students bounded into class one day ecstatic at having landed a job in the luxurious El Conquistador pure coincidence Hotel. She expressed her sincere gratitude at all she'd gained from my class because The Native staff was not allowed to speak Spanish on the premises unless approached in Spanish lest the mostly American clientele feel offended. Nor she added were they allowed to kiss or hug each other hello nor goodbye. And unruly hair was frowned upon. In other words they couldn't be Puerto Rican and their knowledge of another language their comfort with human contact their very sincerity was unwanted as they served their American guests in their own country. But she maintained a smile as she told me of her new job there.That squarepeg status is all too familiar for us. Seeing Topiltzin in his Monk garb for the first time is initially comically shocking then sad. His long flowing beautiful hair has been shaven off. It becomes heart wrenching to hear this foreign language spewing from his lips. Even in seemingly total assimilation even when it appears to give us an edge we are not accepted in our own country as ironically we cannot accept Topiltzin. We can feel the sting as Topiltzin is made to bow to a Virgin Mary that bares no resemblance to him maybe recalling those parochial school days in that scratchy drab uniform. But we can also recognize our collective Latino culture's obsession with the paradox of a Virgin Mother. Gang members spill each other's blood with total disregard yet turn the corner and sign the cross to a spraypainted mural of La Virgin Maria. An uncomfortable insight we can feel the turmoil Topiltzin is suppressing in the name of survival.Then there are the issues around our names. Topiltzin is renamed Tomas and that incites the obvious jabs we silently bare when one of us is nicknamed Mr. J because Jimenez is too hard to pronounce. More complex is our Latino notion of a surname being a public sign of legitimacy and acceptance. Growing up in a poor minority community I remember wondering why most of my classmates had different last names than their single mothers'. To carry a father's last name even if that were eventually to be the only thing he'd willingly give his offspring was a badge of pride  at least in the eyes of the mothers. In reality it was more often than not the child's sole imposed connection to a man he would never meet. When Cortes announces that his child would bare his last name but that his wife does not it speaks volumes  he is claiming the future.Also pulsing through the heart of The Other Conquest is that everpresent need to procreate within one's own race. This is a theme touched upon by many of our contemporary artists crossing forms and cultural bridges from Toni Morrison's Beloved to John Legguizamo's Mambo Mouth. In one of the most artistically gripping scenes of the film Topiltzin and Isabela consummate their relationship. Devoid of lust this survival tactic will ironically begin a new race a generation of Duality and Paradox.Duality and paradox again my Generation . From the opening shot of the two faces of the Aztec Warrior to the masterfully combined classical and primal musical score to its differentyetfamiliar format our duality is reflected again and again in The Other Conquest. It seems that within a Generation defined and named for its very lack of commonality we Gen  still don't fit in  until we come together. There is no question in my mind why Isabela and Topiltzin had to connect.But ultimately in selfexamination when we play the steel drums paint African Madonnas and hang golden crosses from the necks of Gangsta rappers we have to ask ourselves who's conquered whom?That is comments Carrasco the question at the heart of La Otra Conquista. I didn't mean to answer it... just ask it. True far from a Strum and Drang approach the question is presented with neither lecture anger nor judgment.Like us it just...is.".

It is based on the consequences of the Spanish Military Conquest of Mexico led by Hernn Corts in the early sixteenth century.  The Other Conquest is set against this backdrop and explores the religious conquest of Topiltzin the son of the Aztec King Montezuma and his favorite mistress.  It is powerful yet beautiful educational yet entertaining sexual yet romantic brutal yet compassionate. The director Salavdor Carrasco expertly weaves these contrasts into a film that grabs your attention from the beginning and takes you on an astonishing ETicket ride.  The photography is stunning and the music is captivating.  You will not forget this film.  The only problem will be finding it.  As I write this in September 2001 I have been looking for it for almost a year.  I only recently learned that a small number of videos without English subtitles are available. Hopefully Seor Carrasco will release an English subtitled version of this Great film very soon.   This film deserves a much wider audience than it has had.".

It evidently spoke to some in an harmonicvibration vivalaraza way but I was disappointed.The Virgin of Gualalupe mothergoddess Tonantzin theme is nothing new. I don't fault the film for playing it again only for doing it in such an artsy and mystic way. The script began to drag just when the culture conflict could have made this a great movie. It became unrealistic when it could have shown the true conflict the ColuhaMexica Aztec experienced when their own gods deserted them.And what a lame ending! What was this miracle the friar sent for Cortez to see anyway? I replayed it several times to see if the Virgin's eyes had turned brown or his had turned blue or if his bruises were roses..nada. Especially with the long dramatic buildup for the miracle scene with the camera pan and the music and all but nada. Just the friar's assertion that the scene somehow depicted the racial harmony that understanding and compassion could bring. The film should somehow have revealed that not just asserting it with dialogue especially since it isn't a truth of Mexican history.Okay the cinematography and score were great. It got off to a good start. There was some wonderful dialogue as discussed in other posts the They want to take our souls mistranslation for example. I don't really quibble as some have about the the historical inaccuracies. I personally would rather have seen constructed or generated sets that depicted the original beauty of the preColombian architecture than modernday ruins.The film was too easy on the Spanish..they did monstrous things out of greed and soulsaving. Hundreds maybe thousands were literally burned at the stake for not forsaking the pagan gods hundreds of thousands perhaps millions otherwise died as a consequence of the conquest. It was way easy on the Mexica tens of thousands were sacrificed to their gods and they all didn't go as willingly as that sexy naked virginbabe. Many were children.I wanted to like this film but I can't even recommend it except to neoNahua kooks. It beat all hell out of Apocalypto though.".

	schema:reviewBody "La Otra Conquista is a brilliant film directed by Salvador Carrasco. It's rare to find a film like this where it tells the other side of the story in this case of the Aztecs. Carrasco does not however bore us with a historical documentary styled drama but paints a very honest picture of the conquest. We feel so powerfully about this film because the message is so universal. Whatever background nationality race culture ideology etc. you come from we have all experience some sort of conquest and we have all raised some kind of resistance to such conquest. Topiltzin the protagonist embodies this resistance and we feel an immediate connection to him. It was very interesting that the actor casted for Topiltzin was actually a dancer and casted for that very reason. It was a risky but very brave choice for Carrasco to cast Damian Delgado as the protagonist rather than a brand name actor. Delgado does deliver a memorable performance especially for a firsttime actor. One thing I felt that did not quite work was the dialogue. I don't know if it was just the translation but sometimes I felt the dialogue was very didactic and slow. I do however understand that the reason for this was probably because most of the story was told through the imagery and mise en scene of the scenes. Maybe Carrasco wanted to redirect the attention from what's being said to what's being shown. Overall the film is beautifully shot especially on such a tight budget. Carrasco actually commented that the scenes showing the Aztec ruins is actually smack in the center of a very urban city but the cinematographer was able to cleverly conceal the anachronistic elements behind the ruins. Carrasco also commented that the scenes showing the inside of the ruins were actually shot few years apart but through the flawless editing of the film it's undetectable.".

The director Salvador Carrasco spent much time researching the era to bring an authentic feel to this piece.  The cinematography production design costumes makeup are all excellent.  For further detail just see the wonderful website created for the movie.So what's wrong with this film?  1 The script.  It needs to be more narrative and less didactic.  It's too concerned with its message that the characterization suffers as a result.  Furthermore it felt as if the look of each scene determined how the characters were going to behave.  As a result the film is long and tedious.  2 The direction.  This film needs to adapt a more direct narrative and avoid arty gimmicks such as replicating Diego Rivera images which take away from the purpose of the film.  Because of Mexico's complex history the subject matter can be difficult to understand even for the informed and the direction doesn't help much in this regard.Looking at Mr. Carrasco's credits on the IMDB I noticed that this is his first film as a director.  It is a remarkable achievement however one that unfortunately does not do the subject matter justice.  Hopefully he can do what Robert Rodriguez did with El Mariachi and be given the opportunity to remake his first film. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "The Other Conquest has had the most successful theatrical run in Mexico's history as well as being the first film to address Spain's conquest of Mexico.  Amazingly it has the look of an epic Hollywood presentation with the sensibility of an independent production I really can't think of another independent film that looks and sounds as grand as this.  It is paradoxical that it takes an independent to remind us of a time when Hollywood epics were thought provoking when it is released nationally in the States it will most likely incite other directors to examine and dramatize Mexico's perplexing history.  We can only hope that they will be able to present the subject with as much depth and character as director Salvador Carrasco has.SPOILER ALERTThe Other Conquest is all the more striking because there are so few current pictures that encapsulate such a strong contrast of tones.  It is quiet and harrowing violent and peaceful thoughtprovoking and visceral as well as being infinitely complex amidst a straightforward storyline.  After seeing the film my friends and I discussed our different readings but we all converged when it came to premise and plot.  We had some conflicting interpretations concerning the moral compass of the characters which is due to the filmmaker's refusal to portray both the oppressors and oppressed as all good or all bad.  For instance I felt the Friar had good intentions but my wife saw him as guilty as the Captain I thought the Virgin Mary's tear was a projection of Topiltzin's mentality yet my friend took it literally.  The film deals with a myriad of issues that led us to intense even philosophical discussion but there was never any question as to what the story meant.  I can't remember the last film to work on that many levels.The narrative centers on Topiltzin Damian Delgado an Aztec scribe who is the most resilient of his tribe.  During a sacred ceremony involving human sacrifice the tribe is violently invaded and conquered by Cortes' Inaki Aierra army.  Even after his fellow tribesmen and women convert Topiltzin states I know who I am. I don't adapt.'  His allegiance to his culture comes at a price.  Captain Cristobal Quijano Honorato Magaloni is centered on the physical torture of Topiltzin while Friar Diego Jose Carlos Rodriguez becomes obsessed with converting his soul.  However Diego has met his match with Topiltzin.  Instead of rejecting the Catholic faith Topiltzin acknowledges the Virgin Mary as a signifier that both societies no matter how polarized share the same need for spirituality.  Topiltzin is more evolved than Friar Diego because he is able to reconcile both faiths with the idea that the spiritual world is not as dogmatic as the human world.SPOILER ENDI recommend The Other Conquest with highest accolades.  In this age where we are force fed rote messages that trivialize the idea of tolerance this film induces the audience to think deeply about the ramifications of ignorance and cruelty.".

During a sacred ceremony involving human sacrifice the tribe is violently invaded and conquered by Cortes' Inaki Aierra army.  Even after his fellow tribesmen and women convert Topiltzin states I know who I am. I don't adapt.'  His allegiance to his culture comes at a price.  Captain Cristobal Quijano Honorato Magaloni is centered on the physical torture of Topiltzin while Friar Diego Jose Carlos Rodriguez becomes obsessed with converting his soul.  However Diego has met his match with Topiltzin.  Instead of rejecting the Catholic faith Topiltzin acknowledges the Virgin Mary as a signifier that both societies no matter how polarized share the same need for spirituality.  Topiltzin is more evolved than Friar Diego because he is able to reconcile both faiths with the idea that the spiritual world is not as dogmatic as the human world.SPOILER ENDI recommend The Other Conquest with highest accolades.  In this age where we are force fed rote messages that trivialize the idea of tolerance this film induces the audience to think deeply about the ramifications of ignorance and cruelty.";

Nahuatl is the language spoken by the Aztecs the people of Tenochtitln now Mxico City. They were formally known as Nahuatls.People must understand that two invasions were made to Mxico in 1592 the military invasion led by Hernn Corts and the theological led by the Catholic Church.The first won by an inhuman difference primarily because of the common cold virus and other illnesses imported by the Spaniards.The second was never consumed for the traditions and beliefs are so deeply rooted in the Nahuatl people that many of them are still kept alive by many of us over 400 years latter and that is what makes you proud of being Mexican With all the bad stuff that has happened after all that time we've never stopped being Mexican.The only drawback I see in this film is that many people will not make sense of some of the dialog or reactions of the characters therefore I recommend you do a small research of preColumbian specifically Mexican culture before you feast your senses to this spectacle.If you wish to understand more of the Mexican culture watch this movie.

It not only tells the story from the point of view of the Spanish but also from Aztecs that were being conquered. Coming from the Philippines I have noticed several similarities between our culture and that of Mexico. Not to mention both have been conquered by Spain and Catholicism is the predominate religion in both countries.Topilzin the main character of the story represents a conquest for one's identity. He battles between his own cultural beliefs and those instilled upon him by the Spanish invaders. In doing so he becomes torn between two ideals which ultimately leads to a compromise of the two. He accepts Christianity but won't relinquish his own belief system.In many ways this story is symbolic for how cultures assimilate other cultures into their own. The Philippines for example is a fusion of many cultures. It is a mixture of many beliefs knowledge values and ideas. And yet they are still able to call it their own.I would recommend this movie to anyone who is trying to get in touch with their roots.

Mexico's very first blockbuster epic is brought to life by film director Salvador Carrasco and his team of storytellers who centralize on bringing to life the controversial history of Mexico's people. This isn't a knockoff variable picture and in no way does it come to resemble Mel Gibson's falsely depicted post gore epic Apocalypto but in fact this film with such symbolic meaning combining the story of historic figures like Hernan Cortes drives out the motion picture story of what was suppressed in the history of Mexico from the wipe of the Aztecs to how Spanish blood became infused within the Mexican peoples. Though watching this film as an exCatholic I find it a great picture that details the forced Catholicism conversion happenings that occurred during the Spanish conquest of Mexico yet flowing with the message of the people without creating hate for a religion. Beautifully photographed by Arturo de la Rosa The Other Conquest combines symbolism surrealism metaphors and Christian imagery which haunts the mind of the viewer as something more than just the story of a people who diminished but the fight to stay true to ones own belief's. The film isn't so much the conquest of a people but the conquest of one man Topilitzin who bound to his beliefs and in the end died for his own sake of conquering a belief known to himself that he would not fall into conversion. Although set in a different century The other conquest seeds a modern day message that cultural tolerance is never to be abandoned.".

It is a powerful drama that fully captures the struggles faced by any people that has been conquered.

The film is about her journey from spoilt brat to English Boarding schoolgirl. If you're into Rom Coms and you're between 12  19 years of age I would definitely recommend this one for a good night in with the girls. there's some magnificent Alex Pettyfer moments JUST WANT TO ADD  That there have been many complaints mostly from British girls  of which I am about the way British girls are portrayed in this film but please rethink this and look at how Americans are treated! Our main character starts as a lying self obsessed and vain brat and her best friend Ruby American proceeds to steal her boyfriend and backstab her!

Swinging from one end of the spectrum of an ideal kid to a spoilt and bratty one her Poppy Moore character in Wild Child is a rich kid who has issues with discipline because she thinks she could get her way with her devil may care attitude and wads of cash. With her relationship with her father going to the doldrums she gets shipped off to an English boarding school in an effort to be schooled in the prim and proper and thus sets up plenty of room for your typical fish out of water story.Naturally as the loner who stands out because of her rather uncouth behaviour and fashion sense this was somewhat a throw back to The House Bunny where the protagonist is clearly out of place and remains to be seen if it is herself who would be assimilated into the norm or if she could be the trendsetter and begin a serious case of behavioural osmosis.For starters this is clearly chick flick territory with all characters being girls it's set in an all girls boarding school and the only male supporting characters happened to be her dad Aidan Quinn the school principal's son Freddie Alex Pettyfer for romantic purposes and Nick Frost who cameos as a small town hairstylist. So you can imagine the amount of bitching that would go around in the film where Poppy offends the head student on her first day on multiple fronts thereby starting off some serious personal vendetta issues. Or how Poppy is initially unwelcome by everyone in her dormitory because her stubbornness got them all detention before they decide to assist her in a winwin situation  getting her expelled so that she could return home.Wild Child is surprisingly entertaining with a good story to tell even though it's the usual about having friends for life versus the superficial ones that one tend to meet from time to time. I guess for parents this could be one of those childsafe movies to bring their kids to and hopefully to have some of its positive messages rub off on their kids. Written by Lucy Dahl daughter of the renowned Roald Dahl that credit alone provided some interest in this movie despite the story and plot development being nothing unusual and being very predictable.But I guess predictability could still work if the ensemble cast delivered their roles convincingly which they do and with any movie that deals with friendship and one targetted at children this is as plain sailing a movie as it can get  nobody dies everyone becomes friends tense situations get diffused amicably and there's plenty of BFFlove to go around.".

For those expecting a tween film like What A Girl Wants this is not it! There's a lot of swearing sexual reference and drinking which is more like the kind of things normal 16 year olds do.

	schema:headline " This isn't a chick flick it's a nobody flick.";
	schema:reviewBody "There's no doubt about it Wild Child is not a film for the male populace. So far this year I've had a surprisingly rewarding experience with chick flicks usually finding at least something positive to cling onto during the course of the feature and at times even enjoying the movie as a whole. Yet today was not one of those days as sadly enough my male attributes got the better of me. With all of this said however despite my obvious problem with connecting to any of the characters on the screen I found it hard to believe that anyone could do so regardless of gender age or anything else Wild Child is formulaic dumb mawkish and irksome not just through it's nave inane plot but more importantly through its just as banal characters. Devoid of any real likable personalities or interesting original characterisation director Nick Moore's feature length debut neither sustains any entertainment value nor offers any significant insight into the script's themes. Younger female audiences will probably appreciate it a little better than me but not by much.I don't know what's worse watching lead character Poppy Emma Roberts a supposed rebellious Buddhist fashion queen of Malibu prance around for the first half of the movie playing the same Eww! England is so dirty and medieval! note or seeing the British antagonised once again as stuffy snobbish dirty monarchist morons that have never heard of an iPhone. Told in two polarising halves the story here attempts to tell the tale of someone becoming a better person and coming of age by leaving behind their spoiled bourgeois lifestyle behind for a much more disciplined and simpler life. Instead however what Wild Child achieves is a sort of cartoon annoyance that's only real intent seems to be to rehash countless other similar stories whilst at the same time demoralising every act and line of dialogue that comes out of all the characters' mouths. It's transparent and utterly drab never truly conveying the difference in cultures between the British and Americans with relevance or even comic effect I wonder if you have ever seen Wife Swap? If so it's a bit like that only with more cheese at the end of the race.The first half of the movie with its black and white ethics and cultural insight tinged with humourless jokes and crass characterisation is thankfully the weaker half but this still doesn't say much for the second. Following Poppy as she and her new friends attempt to get her expelled from the boarding school so that she can travel back home to Malibu it's of no surprise that soon Poppy through trying to escape finds she doesn't want to leave. Not only is it predictable and without any original flavours whatsoever but it's overlong and tiresome. The working in of a seedy antagonist set out to take revenge on Poppy for the sheer sake that she's always been the queen of the school and now Poppy looks to steal her thunder is just as tedious and useless. In the end all these elements come together in the form of a ridiculous school court hearing judging the fate of a certain character and at this point it's clear just how derivative and mawkish the whole affair is. Of course it all climaxes in a super happy ending for everyone but the evil antagonist that actually presumes you thought it was going to end up anywhere else yet doesn't ever lead you to do so beforehand.This just about sums up the entire feature it's anticlimactic mundane and lazy with only slight glints of interest to be seen over the course of the superfluous runtime. One underused strength in particular is the relationship dynamic between Poppy and her father yet sharing only a few scenes together nothing much is achieved or capitalised on. Instead the film occupies most of its time making sure to throw in tired jokes about the differences in culture that presumably exists between America and Britian which if you've ever been to both countries you'll know isn't as caricature as it is portrayed here. Of course cultural stereotypes can be funny but that's not the case here it's humdrum humour filtered through characters that you don't even want to laugh with. I suppose if I was to state one clear coherent aspect of the film it would be Michael Price's score. Yet I hope you can see that with a movie such as this when the music captures your attention more than anything else that is going on you've got trouble. Lame sappy and pretentious it certainly won't help to see this if you're a guy but even if you're not I advise you give it a miss anyway this isn't a chick flick it's a nobody flick.A review by Jamie Robert Ward.

Later on in the film things were getting a little bit better although the characters were so annoying it was frustrating to watch...It doesn't relate to many other films apart from St. Trinians. This film is different in its own sense of humour but that gets boring after a while...I recommend this for a girlish slumber party otherwise its a miss!".

Acting and direction are excellent and there is a lot of enthusiasm from everyone involved. The dialogue is fast I actually found it a little too fast for me to keep up with in places  but I'll catch up with what I missed when I see it again! and there's plenty of it. I like films with plenty of dialogue and found what the girls were saying to be interesting. An example might be the way they had found ways to circumvent the school's rules e.g. as regards their mobile phones. There is plenty of action and visual humour and a few touching bonding scenes  as well as some quieter and more introspective moments. I thoroughly recommend seeing this entertaining thoughtprovoking moving and most enjoyable film .".

Emma Roberts plays her character Poppy fantastically and really shows her development throughout the film. Having a good looking lead boy also helps.

I came across this movie by accident I never followed the entertainment world since I left High School it's not that important in my book. I was at first skeptical that I must admit. Still I am glad I looked pass that and went on to watch the entire movie. The movie is first definitely not any Oscar or any award material. It's just some feel good movie. Something that makes you laugh and wanted to hate the villain. It's done fairly well in my book. Though to me Emma Roberts looked too much like she's trying to Addie Singered the role yes I did watch Unfabulous I have young cousins and turned it Malibu. From where I stand I think Ms Roberts could have done better but she's young I suppose there are time to learn. Alex Pettyfer aren't too bad but seeing I've watched Strombreaker I couldn't stop seeing him as Alex Rider just yet. He's a little stiff but pleasant.Frankly if you're expecting some high roll movie and have too much of an expectations you would be disappointed. However if you look at the movie just as another work of art you'd find it fairly enjoyable. It's not exactly a masterpiece nor is it going to put the actors on the map of the world but if you really thought about it you could possibly see those characters around you in the people you know in your life or the ones in Hollywood. It's funny not too dramatic sweet slightly eccentric and somewhat charming in its own way. Though seriously can anyone stop comparing places and schools in England to Hogwarts? What's this? Hogwarts  That line the movie would have been better off without it. And overall the movie is not too bad moderate acting skills slightly predictable storyline and not a bad movie to watch every now and then to take your mind of 'seriousness'.".

It can be argued that Harriet was an unpleasant person but was Poppy really so different?

It's clear after watching this that Gene and Paul are the one's in control of the band and they have no problem trashing the former members of the band in this documentary. Gene even went so far as to give Paul credit for Ace's logo showing that some bad blood still remained at this time.Overall this movie will provide you with laughs videos classic stories and generally interesting drama involving one of rock and roll's most charismatic bands.

	schema:headline " Entertaining but not one of his best";
	schema:reviewBody "Up to the middle 1980's Pierre Richard was a major figure in French comedy this film though pretty entertaining is not one of his best. The title word La Carapate is not actually correct French but is derived from the verb se carapater meaning to go on a jaunt a spree or an adventure.In this film he plays the lawyer for a violent criminal who has been condemned to death and whom he is visiting in Prison in Lyon. The time is set in May 1968 when there were numerous studentworker riots in several of France's larger cities. During the visit things turn bad there is a riot where prisoners escape and our violent criminal  played by Victor Lanoux  escapes taking Pierre Richard hostage. The body of the film covers their escapade from Lyon to Paris via Dijon and Auxerre and culminates on the wartorn streets of central Paris.This film is lively and active  there are good ideas  though all is not funny. Grard Oury is a superior director and though he has produced far better efforts such as Le Corniaud or Rabbi Jacob it is still a pleasure to watch this film as our two heroes wend their way towards Paris. In fact the film is a satire of all the characters in France at that time  the revolting students the CRS and the police the rich French thinking it was the end of the world and trying to flee the country with their wealth stashed away in their cars  as personified by the couple of the much loved JeanPierre Darras and his wife . The great Raymond Bussires one of the funniest of all plays Pierre Richard's father and has a whale of a time sliding down stair rails in apartment buildings.The film is a little pedantic with the political portrayal of each of the main heroes  Richard is supposed to be a gauchiste or left wing extremist and Lanoux is supposed to have fascistic ideas although it should be said that for French people the word fascist is often used to mean simply anything that ISN'T Left Wing so too much importance should not be paid to this by foreign viewers.But on an entertainment level one cannot accuse the film of being boring there's always something interesting happening including lovely ladies doing stripteases on the side of the road and causing pileups although the plot itself in my humble opinion is far less well constructed and less meaningful than in many other Oury films.The film has recently been issued in France as part of a two DVD set of Pierre Richard films the other film being  Le Coup du Parapluie a far superior and much funnier film starring the late Goert Froebe !".

The title word La Carapate is not actually correct French but is derived from the verb se carapater meaning to go on a jaunt a spree or an adventure.In this film he plays the lawyer for a violent criminal who has been condemned to death and whom he is visiting in Prison in Lyon. The time is set in May 1968 when there were numerous studentworker riots in several of France's larger cities. During the visit things turn bad there is a riot where prisoners escape and our violent criminal  played by Victor Lanoux  escapes taking Pierre Richard hostage. The body of the film covers their escapade from Lyon to Paris via Dijon and Auxerre and culminates on the wartorn streets of central Paris.This film is lively and active  there are good ideas  though all is not funny. Grard Oury is a superior director and though he has produced far better efforts such as Le Corniaud or Rabbi Jacob it is still a pleasure to watch this film as our two heroes wend their way towards Paris. In fact the film is a satire of all the characters in France at that time  the revolting students the CRS and the police the rich French thinking it was the end of the world and trying to flee the country with their wealth stashed away in their cars  as personified by the couple of the much loved JeanPierre Darras and his wife . The great Raymond Bussires one of the funniest of all plays Pierre Richard's father and has a whale of a time sliding down stair rails in apartment buildings.The film is a little pedantic with the political portrayal of each of the main heroes  Richard is supposed to be a gauchiste or left wing extremist and Lanoux is supposed to have fascistic ideas although it should be said that for French people the word fascist is often used to mean simply anything that ISN'T Left Wing so too much importance should not be paid to this by foreign viewers.But on an entertainment level one cannot accuse the film of being boring there's always something interesting happening including lovely ladies doing stripteases on the side of the road and causing pileups although the plot itself in my humble opinion is far less well constructed and less meaningful than in many other Oury films.The film has recently been issued in France as part of a two DVD set of Pierre Richard films the other film being  Le Coup du Parapluie a far superior and much funnier film starring the late Goert Froebe !";

I never heard an audience laugh so loud at any comedy either before or since then. I have never been able to find a Zone 1 DVD version North America of this movie. Pierre Richard plays his usual role of the naive but goodhearted protagonist who falls into and out of one difficult situation after another. The plot is a fastpaced chase comedy. The characters are almost comic book stereotypes but unique in their own way. This movie is not subtle but is hilarious. If you liked Les Comperes or Le Chevre this should entertain you just as much. When is someone going to make a North American DVD of this available.?!".

	schema:headline " Slices of good parts giving food for thought about the great man's demise";
	schema:reviewBody "This film tackles a very serious subject of the sudden and violent post war Dec 45 death of General George Patton.The film builds up to the denouement of showing this death to be an assassination something I have thought was a distinct probability given the enemies he made during and post the Allied victory over Germany. The story line of the motivations behind the assassination is built up around the theft a huge quantity of the gold that the NationalSocialist government had accumulated that went missing in action so to speak. The film shows a train hijack of the gold  though not sure if that happened but huge quantities of gold did disappear postwar Germany and was never found.Whether this was really the route and the root of the motivations behind the events which led to his sudden death is debatable but I am very intrigued as to whether or not the death of Patton as shown here was a reasonable accurate recreation of that death something which sadly appears not to worry too many of the previous reviewers. The buildup to the setup so that his vehicle came round a bend and hit a parked lorry seemed to be well done and just how you would expect an accident to be prearranged.Kennedy's portrayal of Patton's aggressive AntiSoviet anticommunism with the postwar Red Army command's behaviour having no difficulty coming right down to meet the low expectations Patton had of them seemed well done. Patton had many enemies in the US. One of the things that he did to infuriate those who wanted to use the Allied victory to unleash a vindictive payback over and against the defeated enemy was to release the PostWar POW's under his jurisdiction the only set of Postwar POW's to be set free during that time to go back home instead of suffering and dying of starvation and disease in unsheltered open fields surrounded by barbedwire and shot at by guards as was the fate of others German solders in these postwar death camps. These Germans were to be made to pay time and again for their collective sin with a usurious rate of interest so that punishment and retribution was to be their fate. Patton wasn't interested in such policies once the victory had been won but his internal enemies were. He was recalled to the US and was due to go home imminently and had already been stripped of his executive powers but Patton's enemies could well have thought that they needed to get their payback time in quickly before he did get back to the US and start to interfere with their plans against postwar Germany because of his highstatus in the US despite their incessant campaigns to undermine his credibility.So an uneven film methinks with some good parts and some bad but the slices of good parts giving food for thought about the great man's demise.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film tackles a very serious subject of the sudden and violent post war Dec 45 death of General George Patton.The film builds up to the denouement of showing this death to be an assassination something I have thought was a distinct probability given the enemies he made during and post the Allied victory over Germany. The story line of the motivations behind the assassination is built up around the theft a huge quantity of the gold that the NationalSocialist government had accumulated that went missing in action so to speak. The film shows a train hijack of the gold  though not sure if that happened but huge quantities of gold did disappear postwar Germany and was never found.Whether this was really the route and the root of the motivations behind the events which led to his sudden death is debatable but I am very intrigued as to whether or not the death of Patton as shown here was a reasonable accurate recreation of that death something which sadly appears not to worry too many of the previous reviewers. The buildup to the setup so that his vehicle came round a bend and hit a parked lorry seemed to be well done and just how you would expect an accident to be prearranged.Kennedy's portrayal of Patton's aggressive AntiSoviet anticommunism with the postwar Red Army command's behaviour having no difficulty coming right down to meet the low expectations Patton had of them seemed well done. Patton had many enemies in the US. One of the things that he did to infuriate those who wanted to use the Allied victory to unleash a vindictive payback over and against the defeated enemy was to release the PostWar POW's under his jurisdiction the only set of Postwar POW's to be set free during that time to go back home instead of suffering and dying of starvation and disease in unsheltered open fields surrounded by barbedwire and shot at by guards as was the fate of others German solders in these postwar death camps. These Germans were to be made to pay time and again for their collective sin with a usurious rate of interest so that punishment and retribution was to be their fate. Patton wasn't interested in such policies once the victory had been won but his internal enemies were. He was recalled to the US and was due to go home imminently and had already been stripped of his executive powers but Patton's enemies could well have thought that they needed to get their payback time in quickly before he did get back to the US and start to interfere with their plans against postwar Germany because of his highstatus in the US despite their incessant campaigns to undermine his credibility.So an uneven film methinks with some good parts and some bad but the slices of good parts giving food for thought about the great man's demise.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a military history buff as well as a big fan of McGoohan I'm a big Prisoner fan and most movies I see him in because of it I'm also curious whenever I see Ed Bishop who I liked in UFO as CDR Styker Captain Blue from Captain Scarlet etc etc and I have loved Cassavetes in the few films I've seen him in The Killers Dirty Dozen Rosemary's Baby. So being how I'm in a foreign land with limited entertainment on the TV I made sure to check out this flick on TCM UK. One things for sure it took guts for George Kennedy to play Patton after George C Scott did it because NO ONE could hope to get close to that performance as a result Kennedy doesn't really try hard Luckily his role is somewhat minor. The beginning is good and than McGoohan comes in and it's pretty bad sorry to say  . His dialog is rather uncomphrensable in his bad American accent so mercifully he gets killed pretty quick totally saw most of the deaths here coming. So thats strike one weak McGoohan performance. Strike two Cassavettes looks really really old in half of this film. He looks like a late age Jerry Orbach so he really doesn't look like the commando OSS stuff that a Sterling Haydon who actually was in his 20's would have looked like. He also is just going through the motions here so he really brings the movie down as the lead. Sophia Loren who gets top billing has an unneeded minor role she also looked better 20 years later in the grumpier old men movie miracles of modern medicine so she's no added attraction although there are a couple of cuties in the film. Von Sydow is good as usual so I guess he kept it going for me. Also I did manage to stay with it because I kept wanting to know how he was going to kill Patton with a rubber pellet in a movie car with the window up all explained so those gaping holes got filled in. Vaugn and Hermann are also a funny footnote as two Gay Colonel's Vaugn gets caught with the help even!. All in all if your in the isolated middle east with lack of entertainment it's worth your 2 hours of time but thats a big if!. 6 out of 10 for the nice tidy ending where most of the bad guys die.".

	schema:headline " One Day I May Watch This Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "One day I might. So far I have watched the halfhour Macauley MiniMovie. That has already earned Brass Target 9 out of 10 so the whole movie could well be a classic of epic proportions.Patrick McGoohan makes his entry to the movie a short way in after a classy prologue explains the plot of the movie itself. Colonel Macauley is found lording it up in a German castle captured by the Allies. He is dressed in an alpine woolly jumper with a gay Austrian titfer complete with feathery knickknack in the hatband. He has been sought out by embittered OSS veteran John Cassavetes. Cassavetes is obviously fond of the old warrior. He knows Macauley is a ne'erdowell shyster these days but in an odd kind of way he still trusts him. Cassavetes seeks his help in the investigation of a huge ReichsGold theft but leaves disappointed eventually after watching Macauley enjoying a sampling of the best German wines his new Bultler can find for him in the cellar of the castle. Sophia Loren arrives and the gallant Macauley beckons her within his gatehouse sweeping a low bow to the Italian beauty as he removes his hat flashing but briefly his chestnut hair.Shortly thereafter the scene changes and Macauley is in a jeep. he is in his smartest brown American uniform and after his mildly dissolute appearance of yesterday we glimpse the soldier that so impressed the earnest Cassavetes. Macauley is as we say in England a little bit crooked but he next meets a truly evil man. Bobby Vaughn plays an utterly amoral corrupter of men. He even shocks the swindling Logistics Colonel. Sadly for Macauley he is a victim of his own weaknesses and has no choice other than to be sucked further into a dark plot that has already murdered 50 of his fellow Americans and now seeks the assassination of the greatest General in the Army Patton.Macauley has to meet with creepy assassin Max Von Sydow at his most chilling Scandinavian best. He hands over 500000 for the 'Hit'. We are becoming conscious that whilst Macauley is sleepwalking into this mire of murderous intent his conscience may send him to Cassavetes at some point to undo this madness he has embroiled himself in. First however Macauley must relax after the tension of his meeting with the cold gunman. He is met not by his expected paramour but by a mysterious and beautiful Fraulein. She persuades him he can trust her by stripping to her brassiere. At this point McGoohan as Macauley comments as he eyes her up and down that he has had a hard hard day or perhaps he said he'd had a hard hard time. I'm not sure which because by then I was giggling at McGoohan's mischievous performance. I must make notes next time. The young lady leads him to the bathroom which is rapidly filling with steam and Macauley asks her if there will be Bubbles? Assured there will he happily heads inside singing a little bubbles song to himself.The Fraulein sits down revealing a tidy leg clad in suspenders and stockings. This was promised for Macauley. Unfortunately Bobby Vaughn guessing that Macauley will inevitably betray the evil plot to Cassavetes has sent an assassin who garrotes Macauley whist the poor man was waiting for Bubbles to arrive. We know Macauley is dead because John Cassavetes checks his corpse in the next scene in the Mortuary.Patrick McGoohan has now left the building.........".

He takes personal charge of the investigation and puts himself in an assassin's cross hairs.I think a lot of good players got wasted here in a film that didn't make sense many times. You have to fill in a lot of gaps. Sophia Loren is in the film top billed in a supporting role that doesn't make any sense.

	schema:headline " Poorly made movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "This was an extremely lacking WW II movie. The story is told poorly and most of the time is just mainly confusing. The movie also lacks in tension and the main characters in the story are handled in a boring and bad way.The cast of this movie is truly impressive. George Kennedy John Cassavetes Sophia Loren Robert Vaughn Max von Sydow Patrick McGoohan Bruce Davison. All are great actors but the material they had been given to work with in this movie was just plain awful. None of the actors really get the opportunity to shine due to the very poor directing and some weak ridicules dialog. All of the characters in the movie are just totally uninteresting to follow. Sophia Loren's character is just pointless and works only distracting and causes the movie its pace to be even more lacking in speed. George Kennedy also really wasn't convincing as Gen. George S. Patton Jr. Robert Vaughn plays a villainous American colonel who also happens to be a very active homosexual in the movie. This just feels totally pointless and was not needed at all for the story. Basically the only really interesting and good character is the hitman played by the always dependable Max von Sydow. Cheering for the bad guy in a movie like this one that's never a good sign. It was also sort of fun to see a young Bruce Davison before he received real fame in the late '90's00's.The story itself really isn't that bad and was good enough to make this movie just as good and entertaining as movies like Where Eagles Dare The Guns of Navarone and The Eagle Has Landed. However the story is told extremely muddled in the movie which makes it hard to understand at times what is the main plot line of the movie. At first you think that the movie is about getting the stolen German gold stock back. However as the movie progresses it becomes obvious that the movie is about an assassination on General Patton instead and the movie turns into a whole different movie entirely almost more in the same style as The Day of the Jackal which was made 5 years earlier. Needless to say that not all of the elements that happen in the story feel connected to each other.The movie is also truly lacking in tension. The movie is slow paced and could had really used some action sequences. Instead the movie is a slow and boring one to watch. Also because the story is so confusing and distorted you never really connect to anything that happens in the movie. The characters feel really distant and the events in the movie are far from interesting or exciting and the movie also totally lacks in style and atmosphere.So why should you watch this movie in the first place? I can think of no reason. It by no means is one of the worst movies ever made but it also most certainly isn't the best in its genre. It's a very poorly made movie with weak directing and storytelling that feels like an huge waste of a great cast and a story that had quite some potential and deserved a better treatment. It's already an almost totally forgotten movie and it should better just stay that way as well.410httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Max von Sydow in a familiar role is the hired hit man and believe me he doesn't confine his activities to killing Patton. He kills everybody. Don't worry that's not a spoiler.John Cassavetes plays the soldier trying to identify the assassin. Sophia Loren is his girlfriend. She is there for star power. Patrick McGoohan is pathetic going for some sort of American accent. Then there's George Kennedy as Patton. He must have needed the money badly. Robert Vaughn and Edward Herrmann are gay soldiers who are in on the heist. Lucky Luciano is also involved somehow.There is one really dandy scene at the end.

What follows is the story of an assassination contracted by the perpetrators on General George S. Patton due to his involvement in the robbery investigation. This does not make a whole lot of sense since Patton was ordered back to the States in a few days therefore the urgency to eliminate him seems rather pointless. Although the cast is strong the screenplay is murky and confusing. Plot contrivances abound especially a highly improbable code breaking.

Not only is it the most cheese filled pap ever it's a walking clich and the people in it even say the word LOL rather than actually laughing in one scene one person even rolls around the floor laughing when she is told a joke by her friend and it wasn't even funny. The entire dialogue in this film looks as if it has actually been written on a Nokia 3310 by a 10 year old boy who has ADHD no offence to people who actually HAVE ADHD but seriously it's like they've given a child three things1. MDMA.2. 90 Blank Sheets of Paper and a typewriter.3. 2 Days to complete it.The acting is below par and even in one scene it is blatantly obvious that the actress has forgotten her lines so she seems to make her line up on the spot. How on earth did Demi Moore get roped into this? Demi Moore has made some god awful movies in her time but this will be a black hole on her CV for many years to come and I imagine she is only kicking herself to the loony bin for partaking in this absolute rubbish.Then I have to mention the obvious fake posts on here which are condoning and praising this teeny bopper movie which is obviously made to capitalise on fans of the girl out of this kids who are grounded and have to use their phones as a social outlet LOL and teen kids who have nothing better to do with their money than go and see how the media thinks they should live their lives.Anyone paying to watch this god awful trash should take themselves and get counselling go and see a doctor because whilst there are thousands and thousands of good script writers trying to earn a living thousands of actors trying to break through and thousands of budding directors just aching for a chance to even get 1 of this budget for their work production companies are still lying and pulling the wool over our eyes with pap like this.If you are fan of the girl in this film think about it and think about it hard!!!If you actually like this girl then you will NOT go and put money into the pockets of the greed ridden pigs who are actually trying to exploit YOU as well as your idol. So I'm not going to give you grief for liking this girl like most will but seriously think about it before you part with your money. If this film does even remotely well the fat corporate pigs will only release more pap with her in to try and prize YOUR hard earned money from your hands and in turn the big wheel of fortune will grind away on YOU and ONLY YOU!It says something when a production company pull out of post production marketing like they did on this kids they want to BURY it without trace because they know how terrible this film truly is! Fair enough watch it on cable it will be on there soon enough download it from some kind of torrent site but whatever you do do NOT go and spend a penny of your money on this you will regret it for years to come.Long live the free thinkers.".

Demi Moore has made some god awful movies in her time but this will be a black hole on her CV for many years to come and I imagine she is only kicking herself to the loony bin for partaking in this absolute rubbish.Then I have to mention the obvious fake posts on here which are condoning and praising this teeny bopper movie which is obviously made to capitalise on fans of the girl out of this kids who are grounded and have to use their phones as a social outlet LOL and teen kids who have nothing better to do with their money than go and see how the media thinks they should live their lives.Anyone paying to watch this god awful trash should take themselves and get counselling go and see a doctor because whilst there are thousands and thousands of good script writers trying to earn a living thousands of actors trying to break through and thousands of budding directors just aching for a chance to even get 1 of this budget for their work production companies are still lying and pulling the wool over our eyes with pap like this.If you are fan of the girl in this film think about it and think about it hard!!!If you actually like this girl then you will NOT go and put money into the pockets of the greed ridden pigs who are actually trying to exploit YOU as well as your idol. So I'm not going to give you grief for liking this girl like most will but seriously think about it before you part with your money. If this film does even remotely well the fat corporate pigs will only release more pap with her in to try and prize YOUR hard earned money from your hands and in turn the big wheel of fortune will grind away on YOU and ONLY YOU!It says something when a production company pull out of post production marketing like they did on this kids they want to BURY it without trace because they know how terrible this film truly is! Fair enough watch it on cable it will be on there soon enough download it from some kind of torrent site but whatever you do do NOT go and spend a penny of your money on this you will regret it for years to come.Long live the free thinkers.";

Juno revealed an ultrasound picture of her baby to its future adoptive parents in person. She laid out an entire living room set on Paulie Bleeker's front lawn to tell him she was pregnant in person. The reason its main character maintained quickwitted comebacks and came up with ironic allegories at the drop of a hat was because of her characteristic of going out and exploring new things. That movie was so refreshing because it took place in a world in which teenagers didn't constantly have the glow of a cell phone screen reflecting off of their faces. In fact there was only one part in the film involving a phone conversation between two people...and both sides had their phones plugged into a jack!So why does LOL's mentioning of such a great movie bother me? Because its own message contradicts Diablo Cody's vision and her faith in teenagers. Cody believed in a world in which adolescents might actually look up from their gadgets turn to each other and like talk. Hell there actually is a scene from WallE in which two morbidly obese men favor looking at monitors with video feed each other when they're in floating chairs side by side.

Its lead characters are so reliant of online social networks where every sentence is simplified and shortened that once they finally log off they use phrases like it's good to love someone so much it hurts. A line like that wouldn't even make it into Juno's deleted scenes section on the DVD. LOL celebrates the idea of kids hunching their heads over a five by three inch screen all day long as the rest of the world passes them by. Don't get me wrong  I'm well aware that there actually are teenagers in the world who are this overly consumed. With it being near impossible to find a person between the ages of 18 and 29 NOT on a phone within a three hour period of time writer and director Lisa Azuelos isn't exactly making up fiction here. But to try to portray these hypnotized kids as deep thinking and complex is wrong. How could they have the drive to reflect on who they are when they don't even put effort into typing out full words into text messages? Like I said it's fine for characters like these to exist because there are real world people like this. But don't try dragging another film down to your level when it boasts unexplained emotions open for interpretation while your own best moment of selfreflection consists of the line Every year it's weird going back to school but here we are just going with the flow.

	schema:reviewBody "LOL 2012  out of 4Lisa Azuelos remakes her own French movie. This one here has Miley Cyrus playing a teen who seems obsessed with sex drugs and music which is something her single mom Demi Moore doesn't know about. I'm guessing that's the socalled plot to this film but the truth is that plot and this movie really don't go together. I can't comment on the original film since I haven't seen it yet but this thing here pretty bad but thankfully it's so bad that most people should be able to get a couple good laughs out of it. I think what really kills the movie is the fact that every character from the teens to their parents are just downright idiots. I mean the Moore character is without question one of the dumbest mothers I've ever seen from any movie. Just watch the way the character pretty much can't put her foot down on anything and the scene where Cyrus talks her out of taking her phone away is just embarrassing. Even worse is a sequence later on when mommy and daughter have it out after mom reads her diary and notices all the things she's been up to. Not only the entire sequence unintentionally funny the performances by the two actresses is just embarrassing. Cyrus really comes off bad here because she can't handle what limited range the character has. The scenes with her crying are just poorly done and I can't say I believed anything she did here. Moore isn't quite as bad but she's burdened by the horrid character. Even Gina Gershon Ashley Greene and Thomas Jane can't do anything. Everything from the dialogue to the actual story is just really bad and there's really nothing good to mention here outside the use of a certain Rolling Stones song. What keeps LOL watchable is how bad it manages to be and I'm going to guess that the only people this thing will appeal to are those who enjoy movies that are so bad they're watchable.".

They can't really get away from their persona. This is a movie in need of gritty reality if it could ever work at all. Neither of them can give the movie that reality. The worst is that everybody is various degrees of annoying. As for the story itself it's a lot of teen melodrama. That's the reason it needs its realism. With so much drama the movie can only work if it isn't so Hollywood. Instead the jokes are bad and this is nothing but a bad teen soap opera. I don't know if the French movie was any better.

Now objectively there have been other worse teen sex movies like the innumerable American Pie sequels but this one is offensive because of the fact that it so obviously has pretensions to be a generation defining examination of the sexual politics of high schoolers. But contrasting this film to even the Tina Fey penned Mean Girls almost a decade this film's junior LOL absolutely pales in comparison. Now I'm willing to give Lisa Azuelos some credit. I have not seen her original 2008 French film and maybe it's good. Maybe it is the sharp edged satire that this film failed to be. Maybe something was lost in the translation to English. Maybe lines such as Skankass ho don't engender the kind of bad laughs in French as they do in English. But ultimately the faults in this movie have to come down to her screenplay. Character motivations change every minute plot lines are introduced dropped only to be either picked up again at a point when it's convenient for the film or just abandoned outright. The casting was atrocious. Miley Cyrus cannot act. Not that any other actress would have much luck trying to breathe life into this rotting  personalityvoid corpse of a character whose only motivation in life seems to be deciding between two nearly identical wispy haired lowrent Cilian Murphy lookalike she's gonna give her Vcard to. But give the artist formerly known as Hannah Montana some credit at least she looks like a teenager! The absolutely goosebump inducing storyline involving the blonde wanting to bump hormonal uglies with her math teacher fails to capture the creepiness and desperation of the situation if only for the fact that the two actors look about six months apart in age! Not that any of that matters as this plot thread like so many others comes to a complete halt with no resolution no consequence and no lessons learned. And that's the biggest problem with this movie it gives us absolutely no reason to care at all about the people in it. Why should I care about Lola's love life? What about this cop am I supposed to find charming apart from his motorcycle and leather jacket? Why should I like Kyle as opposed to the other guy?I can't remember his name and no I won't look it up because I've already spent an hour and a half of my life on this movie and that's about two hours too long. Demi Moore is the only one in this movie that comes across as credible. She's believable as a single mom trying to have a family and a careerWhat career you ask? Good question we're never told.. This movie is a complete mess of halfbaked ideas trying to say something profound about the Twitter generation. Take my advice watch Mean Girls or Fast Times at Ridgemont High two films that despite their age have as much to say about teenagers in their time as they do now.

If this is what our society thinks is a good way for teenagers in this generation to act it needs fixing now. The main character played by Miley Cyrus threw a tantrum because her mother read her diary and found out that she was sleeping with someone she packed her bags and went to live with her dad. This is definitely not how teenagers should be acting. Teenagers need to learn to take responsibility for their actions not jump to conclusions before they've heard the whole story. And they definitely shouldn't expect to get whatever they want whenever they want just because they want it. Which is exactly what this movie is portraying. Basically showing young girls that they can disrespect themselves and their family be rude and impolite to those who love them just because they didn't get what they wanted. Spoilt little brats. I would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone it's sending the wrong message. Especially to teenage girls. Horribly horrendous.".

The main character played by Miley Cyrus threw a tantrum because her mother read her diary and found out that she was sleeping with someone she packed her bags and went to live with her dad. This is definitely not how teenagers should be acting. Teenagers need to learn to take responsibility for their actions not jump to conclusions before they've heard the whole story. And they definitely shouldn't expect to get whatever they want whenever they want just because they want it. Which is exactly what this movie is portraying. Basically showing young girls that they can disrespect themselves and their family be rude and impolite to those who love them just because they didn't get what they wanted. Spoilt little brats. I would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone it's sending the wrong message. Especially to teenage girls. Horribly horrendous.";

They use internet slang in person they are on social media a lot and always using a smartphone. It makes sense for films to reflect that.The problem is that this film is total tripe regardless.The acting is horrendous on all sides particularly Cyrus who clearly already passed the limits of her acting talent in Hannah Montana and needs to just jack it in. How Demi Moore got involved in this I do not know. Sure she's done some bad movies in the past but I thought she was older and wiser now. Apparently not.I not only failed to empathise with any of these people I actively started to dislike all of them for being so woefully one dimensional. If you have a teenage daughter or even just know a teenage girl ask her about her life at school or the boys she likes. I guarantee it will be more interesting and engaging than the plot of this film.I actually consider this film does more harm than good to the very people it portrays. It could have been an insight into the sometimes impenetrable world of teenage life. It could have shown parents or other adults how things have changed since their youth and why social media is so important to teenagers these days. Instead it just reinforces the image that they are shallow whiny and entitled 'kids' with no perspective on the real world.I would say this is just for hardcore Miley Cyrus fans but actually it's more likely to upset you if you liked her before. It's not for anyone simple as that.".

There is no way in hell that these kids would be hanging out with that many hot girls. The group of friends that is portrayed in this awful film would never be considered the cool kids at this school. Not once in this movie are these kids actually bullied. Why do these movies portray the cool kids in high school to be a bunch of whiny artsy kids who complain all the time and constantly look like they are about to cry? Not one person I have ever met has ever acted like these kids in high school. Not only did I hate every character in this movie but I hated every word that came out of every stupid mouth. The dialogue seemed to have been written by a thirteen yearold girl who is trying to sound sexually mature. I felt like this presumed thirteenyearold girl writer just wrote one draft to this script and that was that the first draft was the final draft. I was so confused as why people got together or why they broke up or why they got back together. Things would happen with zero explanation to it. Why did Lola and Kyle makeup with no words spoken while on the plane to Paris. They broke up for no reason then got back together for no reason. Then out of nowhere Lola appears to become a lesbian with that blonde haired girl but they never address that relationship. Also at the beginning of the movie Lola says that Kyle was her best friend all her life but at the end of the stupid movie she introduces him to her mom. HOW HAVE THEY NEVER MET IF HE HAS BEEN LOLA'S BEST FRIEND ALL HER LIFE. This movie is the worst movie ever made.".

So I decided to watch the whole thing it never had a plot. That is probably what bothered me the most. However I am not going to slam down as a god awful movie either because I have seen worse. Let me tell you what is good about it or what I really think the writers and makers of this movie were going for. First the movie showed what teenage life is like now. With social media texting partying drinking drugs and relationships It was not sugar coded material which is nice I guess. Second It had some relate to characters. Lola being a teen trying to live her own life. A mother trying to deal with being a single parent. I would some what say they did a fair job at that. However there is so much bad you can say about this movie. Even though I thought Miley was great in The Last Song however I think her acting days are numbered. I also think her singing career is to but hey this about her acting. I felt like she could have given more to her character as Lola. I also think they lack of character develop could had done that. Again I could say so many bad things about this movie you can read other reviews on their experience of this movie. In short I would not recommend this movie on less you want to watch something just because. I would recommend Cyperbully which has Emily Osment as the lead. Very emotional movie and a great example what social media is like these days.".

Anyway if you want some gore check out White Apache dir. by Bruno Mattei.  I'm in that one too by the way  playing the White Apache. Sebastian";

	schema:headline " Many flaws but entertaining fare.";
	schema:reviewBody "In an alltoofamiliar scenario a group of teenagers traveling in Europe discover an isolated villa and choose to stay there overnight unaware of the mansion's dark wartime past. Italian filmmaker Lucio Fulci ventures into the realms of Naziexploitation with this crudely produced yet strangely entertaining obscure lowbudget film. 'The Ghosts of Sodom' begins in a typically sleazy manner with a short portrayal of a drugladen Nazi party of debauchery being filmed by one member of the party who we will soon come to know as Willy Robert Egon. Despite the pseudoeroticised nature of the opening segment the sequence soon takes a rather unpleasant repellent tone before the cutshot quickly transports the viewer back to the present day. It is here that we are introduced to the main characters and rather characteristic of a Fulci film these characters remain underdeveloped throughout and seemingly have no individual personality. This is an unfortunately consistent flaw with a large number of Fulci's movies but more so with this film. Despite a few brief instances the majority of lines in the film could have been spoken by any one of the six main characters. Sadly this rather glaring fault is coupled with numerous instances of wholly pointless and asinine dialogue. However this is not to say that 'The Ghosts of Sodom' is an entirely bad movie. In fact for a production of this type it is a rather accomplished piece of filmmaking. Fulci utilises a beautiful enchanting soundtrack in a professional productive way to create a dynamic dramatic and foreboding atmosphere when coupled with the astonishingly gloomy despairing and mesmerising visual elements that had become one of his trademarks. Although there are only a few gory shots to satisfy those viewers who have become accustomed to Fulci's oftenexcessive usage of gore one should be able to appreciate that the erotic and supernatural elements of the film provide the fodder here. Unfortunately the rather slowpace and often empty prolonged instances of tedium can certainly subtract from the viewing enjoyment and distract the viewer from appreciating the more intricate and important plotaspects a true concern as the story is far from enormously intricate. However in reality how many similar films do not suffer from these same problems? One can appreciate this film for the superb atmospheric presentation if they are able to ignore the predictability plotcharacter flaws and kitsch of the whole production. Despite the somewhat inane storyline although adequate for the production and oftenridiculous scripting of the movie one can certainly waste eighty minutes on films far poorer than this. 'The Ghosts of Sodom' is quite simply Naziexploitation with a supernatural twist which in places is full of tension with the 'Russian Roulette' sequence being the absolute peak of heartpounding suspense. Fans of Fulci's other films may be disappointed but fans of the subgenre may find various things to like about this film despite the movie not being as explicit as other movies of its type. My rating for 'The Ghosts of Sodom'  610.".

Those were the late 70's and the early '80's. After that a good movie was no longer guaranteed.I recently tracked down a couple of his movies I never even heard of. 1972's Don't Torture A Duckling was a surprisingly well done classic. I loved it. Since I never saw it I was afraid it would be dull and outdated. I was wrong. I also saw 1988's Touch Of Death which was certainly OK. Sodoma's Ghost was from the same year but it's anything but OK. It starts of with a dull and laughable naziorgy. After decades 6 young people stay in that same house and are visited by ghosts from the notorious past. The dialog is cheesy the actors are unconvincing and the story is really boring. It feels like time is standing still really hard to watch without using the flash forward button. There are boobs around every ten minutes but even that won't help you not to fall asleep. No idea why Fulci directed it there are a couple of special effects at the end that are hardly worth watching 75 minutes of this mess. In conclusion it's more a rated PG13 softsex hauntinghouse parody than a horror movie. If you want a decent movie Lucio Fulci made around that time watch Touch Of Death or the better Nightmare Concert.".

The results are what opens Sodoma's Ghost as a group of Nazi deserters and prostitutes are at play while Willy films the proceedings. Everyone dances to strange jazz music and claps their hands while watching films of the war then the bombs fall. When you combine this intriguing beginning with a great movie poster you can see why I picked Sodoma's Ghost for a 325 AM viewing.Years later six American students  Mark Paul John Anne Celine and Maria  are traveling to Paris when they find the house we just saw in the opening. It's abandoned but fully furnished and by fully furnished I mean it's packed with all sorts of pornography on the walls. And oh yeah. It's also duly appointed with Nazi ghosts.Also there is a flea market here the Rossi Pop Up Market that used to be a movie theater. You walk from theater to theater some of which are turned into stores and some of which I am certain are now places where hoarders live during the week. This Nazi house looks like one of those theaters with the seats all ripped out and a man in rags ready to surprise you as you search for old DVDs and only find his collection of old bags of Wonder Bread and stacks of old copies of Grit.Is it politically correct of me to say that I would like to think that sexcrazed Nazis would have had better taste in decoration than this?Also It's 21 minutes into a Fulci film and no one has lost their eye yet.That night Anne sleeps alone in a room when the ghost of Willy returns and slaps her around bloodying her lip. He then licks the blood off and they have the most awkward kiss ever while the worst background music ever created plays and she bleeds all over the place. Evil Nazi ghost Willy is also a worse kisser than Randy West. He makes her confess that she loves it. She then wakes up all alone again as it was all just a dream.Every time the kids try to leave they get stuck. The roads all lead back to the house. The car breaks down. The police station answers with evil voices. The phones are cut. And then they're locked in the house. As cabin fever sets in Maria starts to lose her mind.Mark drunk and wandering finds some Nazis playing cards. He joins them only to play Russian roulette for Willy which he survives and is rewarded with a prostitute. As he starts to touch her his hands go right through her body and he's covered with blood. He runs away and sees Paul as a Nazi then tumbled down the steps to his death.Maria then is seduced by a prostitute  who is also a ghost  who tries to turn her against her girlfriend Anne who she claims is cheating with Celine. Speaking of Anne a possessed version of her tries to get with Paul before turning into a corpse. Sex hijinks amongst friends was never this gory. Or ridiculous.Paul and John find the film of the Nazis as Mark's corpse begins to rot. They play the film and just as the ghosts arrive the bomb drops again and the screen goes to black.When everyone wakes up Mark is back alive and it's all a dream. The teenagers finally drive away safe from the Nazi menace.This movie just makes me sad. Anyone but Fulci could have directed it  it's free from the trademark verve and spark of mania that he brought to films where you expected nothing like Conquest. It's rote and boring with it's running time feeling way too long. Honestly  any movie packed with Nazi ghosts sex and violent death should be way more exciting than this.".

The group fall prey to madness and seemingly supernatural forces as the Nazis in spirit return to haunt them. Attempting to get back to the road to Paris they find themselves driving in circles leading right back to the villa. Soon the windows and doors are shut and the group find themselves trapped inside. Spirits begin to appear to certain members when they go to their rooms separately often manipulated by them. Will they escape or are they doomed forever? I'm not that crazy about Fulci's beloved zombie films..except his first one ZOMBI 2 but one thing they weren't and that was boring. For a good hour nothing much happens except the characters argue with each other drink booze contemplate their difficult situation some converse with the spirit of a male or female German who have ulterior motives behind their actions promising pleasure but secretly plotting something else. Fulci never establishes a strong storyline and SODOMA'S GHOST features a rambling series of supernatural occurrences which never quite work. The opening orgy is a deadeningly dull poorly staged and protracted sequence which fails to even titillate. It's over an hour before the gorehounds who admire Fulci so much get what they seek out when looking for his movies..and even when you get the gore it's minimal..one male victim attempts to grab the breasts of a female German ghoul only to rip apart her deteriorated flesh eventually confronting a friend believing he's a Nazi tumbling down a flight of stairs crushing his skull at the bottom and soon his corpse begins to rot with puss oozing from slowly appearing sores and decaying skin. The entire film consists of one uneventful sequence after another with nothing exciting ever produced. And the ending is yet another It's all a dream scenario..yawn. The characters are routine and trite and their plight you could care less about. I believe even his most ardent admirers would have a hard time defending this misfire. It's one of his raunchier films but lacks any kind of eroticism whatsoever as Fulci teases with possible lesbianism..at least he could've delivered a nice female lovemaking session to spice things up a little but even here Fulci couldn't deliverwithout executing anything properly. Dreadful movies like this fuel Fulci's critics with proper ammunition. I'm not sure if it was lack of inspiration or funds available but Fulci doesn't even create an atmosphere in the film with nothing but boobs to capture your attention or divert your mind from looking at your watch.".

	schema:headline " Fulci's art died before him";
	schema:reviewBody "I think it all boils down to passion and driving force the key thing that made Lucio Fulci the unique director he was and many of his movies absolutely fabulous. I can't really think of any director in the history of cinema who was so much about commitment and motivation. Maybe Edward D. Wood Jr and that's an interesting comparison. While Fulci went straight on seemingly against any possible sensibility and good advice he had a style and a vision and an inner logic that somehow made it all work albeit not for neither a traditional mainstream nor arthouse crowd whereas the same thing drove Edward D. Wood Jr to becoming known as the worst director of all time. It is a strange fine line though because Ed Wood could certainly have made Sodoma's Ghost.When Lucio Fulci made movies he didn't just make a movie it seems to me. With a history of both medical school and art criticism I imagine him as this Leonetempered butcher with a knack for art and a mind that's all happy trigger. The kid is going to get his brains drilled out don't ask questions it's not over the top! What do you mean you can't puke out your intestines!! I say it so it must be so! His creativity seems to have been radically set at random he could to the silliest movies and still squeeze in some kind of more or less profound message and he could jump into whatever project that seemed reasonably interesting. Murder to the tune of the seven notes that sounds great! I want to make that movie! Of course when he pulled it all together he made movies that apart from being simply awesome also totally challenge how we label art and genre in cinema. The Beyond for instance is simply a great movie but I can't really label it as anything else A wonderful movie that could only have been created by a very specific and unique vision executed with passion and driving force. And that was Fulci's trade and that's the reason that most of his movies are interesting entertaining or at least positively watchable if you appreciate him.That is also the reason why Sodoma's Ghost is a tragedy to watch. I don't know all that much about Fulci's life so I can't speculate too much but obviously he went downhill during the 90's and if you follow the reasoning I presented just now it must have been a mental fallback as well. Fulci's career was that of an explorer's and it seems logical that after being done with horror he could have ventured off into something else. True all his later movies are more interested in more or less classical Gothic motifs but it just isn't strong enough. Specially in the case of Sodoma's Ghost which has got to be Fulci's weakest effort and this is the key word here 'weak'. On paper Sodoma's Ghost has every chance to be a great Fulci movie. A nazi ghost in a cursed house infiltrates the minds of a bunch of kids on the road making their own weakness their doom. It paves the way for his trademark pessimism the eerie surrealism clever gore and the classic Fulci theme of the human eyeball and who sees what. I can even accept the hokey ending which I won't give away. And once in a while we are talking seconds or bare minutes of film a splinter of a good thing appears. The first sequence is the only true good scene in the movie but there are others involving our charismatic nazi ghost that float somewhere around the interest mark but it never becomes worthwhile because you can so strongly sense the movie being simply dead.I never thought I'd have to say this about a Fulci movie but the actors and their dialogs are crap. Who are these people? Maybe acting in Fulci movies in general isn't more bad than melodramatic but the people in front of the camera in Sodoma's Ghost look like random people picked up on the street. They read lines and make one or two attempts at acting but what's worse is that Fulci has not given an attempt to make this movie worthwhile for anybody. It's almost dark the kids say upon arrival to the house yet it's obviously daylight! They can't escape from the house  because they just can't! When the characters talk you find that you barely comprehend the words they are saying as said by these actors because it is so stale and rudimentary that you begin to wonder if you shouldn't clean the house instead. One of the kids lay dead on the floor the others mourn him. Minutes later they are cracking jokes by his corpse which by the way is magically starting to fry. For a good part of the movie he lies around they pass him and should see his oozing corpse but not until they have to do they see his gory presence laying there in plain sight.There is not a single eyeball zoomin in Sodoma's Ghost and while some might think that is fan bigotry I think it really is just an example of dead passion or a way of thinking that this really isn't a Fulci movie at all. In fact it ain't much of a movie at all! It consists of scenes yes but I think Sodoma's Ghost is more recorded data than a proper movie. There is not any point of reference given to make anybody understand the coherence of it not in theme nor in plot and as a director Fulci comes off as a dying animal in this movie. The shots seem barely finished the movie barely cut together and you know on a pure quality level Bruno Mattei did better movies than this.".

I can't really think of any director in the history of cinema who was so much about commitment and motivation. Maybe Edward D. Wood Jr and that's an interesting comparison. While Fulci went straight on seemingly against any possible sensibility and good advice he had a style and a vision and an inner logic that somehow made it all work albeit not for neither a traditional mainstream nor arthouse crowd whereas the same thing drove Edward D. Wood Jr to becoming known as the worst director of all time.

However there's nothing but boring scenes of the teenagers talking about being lost and every once in a while you get some pretty girls taking their clothes off.Being a Fulci film you'd expect some gore but you'll be disappointed because there is very little. Again the lack of a budget meant not much could be done with the special effects so we're basically left with nothing. The death scenes are all rather bland and boring and the only saving grace is that the orgy sequence is so bad that you can laugh at it.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has been kicking around on cable TV lately and I've put off watching it because I expected it to be another very stretched version of a buddy cop movie. The story seems made for it. Experienced old reallife marshal Wyatt Earp teaches callus young phony cowboy Tom Mix how to solve a crime. Dragnet on a 1920s back lot. But it wasn't that way at all.It's true enough that Earp Garner hung around Hollywood at the time or maybe a bit earlier. We don't really get to know much about his past. But although Mix Willis drove expensive cars and wore flashy suits and big hats he wasn't a phony. He'd been a real cowboy too was a great rider fought in the SpanishAmerican war and could take care of himself. Instead of the expected clash between the master and the tyro we get two guys who pretty much hit it off with one another right away and show mutual respect.It's an interesting friendship.But then the movie turns darker. A murder takes place. There are fist fights mostly comic and several shootouts done seriously. Willis is kind of cocky. Garner displays the laconic offhand dignity he showed in Murphy's Romance or whatever it was. He's an icon here with that black outfit and mustache. He's never been a flashy actor but invariably a competent one. Offscreen he's come up with some dandy spontaneous comments about how the social world of Hollywood and the rest of the country is structured. He's got my vote. Willis isn't bad either.The rest of the cast does yeoman work but no one has roles that are as interesting as those of the two leads. And the murder story fails to grip the viewer at least this viewer. I didn't really find myself caring who did it although it was clear from the beginning who the villains were. There was an exception though the British actress playing Garner's former lover. She's simply outstanding in a supporting part and provides a great example of how to be beautiful without being beautiful. I wish the film didn't seem kind of  I suppose lost is the word. It meanders between comedy drama and warmth without seeming to know just what it wants to do. This isn't a total failure on Edwards' part. It holds together as a story but the characters bounce off one another. Henry Mancini who wrote many scores for Edwards' films shows his versatility here.The score is quiet and unobtrusive except for one or two brass bands that seem to follow Tom Mix around and is punctuated by contemporary recordings including one by Duke Ellington. The photography is first rate. It must be getting hard to find locations that look like Southern California looked in the 1920s before the irruption of humans and their artifacts. It's worth watching. But I don't know where that title came from. Sunset. What is the sun setting on? Not Earp. He's old but not doddering and he can shoot and make love even at the risk of permanent damage. It's not setting on Hollywood which would continue to book for another two generations or so. I suppose we'll settle for its being one of those generic titles that could mean anything. Another Dawn. Guns of Darkness. On the Edge. Sunset. The Muppets Conquer the Mustang Ranch.".

It's worth watching. But I don't know where that title came from. Sunset. What is the sun setting on? Not Earp. He's old but not doddering and he can shoot and make love even at the risk of permanent damage. It's not setting on Hollywood which would continue to book for another two generations or so. I suppose we'll settle for its being one of those generic titles that could mean anything. Another Dawn. Guns of Darkness. On the Edge. Sunset. The Muppets Conquer the Mustang Ranch.";

Pay no attention to the critics this is good stuff.  Bruce Willis as Tom Mix and James Garner as Wyatt Earp have never been better at their laidback charmboy schtick.  The plot while complex and often violent is not to be taken seriously  or better still not to be thought about at all.  In this connection just remember what the movie itself tells you It's all true give or take a lie or two.  In addition to Willis's and Garner's stellar performances Kathleen Quinlan as Mix's long suffering girl friend is a hoot.  The mood of time and place  1929 Hollywood  is perfectly captured  interesting costumes great looking vintage cars the last gasp of the Jazz Age just before the Depression.  Highly recommended 7 out of 10.".

I liked Willis as Tom Mix although I am not otherwise much of a Bruce Willis fan except that I loved Moonlighting ...  I thought he gave a much more subtle and textured performance than he has done in most of his movies. And of course I've liked Garner since I was a girl watching Maverick on TV.Black Edwards' movies are not everyone's cup of tea I guess. I love most of them and minimally enjoy the rest. His movies are always intelligent the wit biting the dialogue sharp with some extraordinary monologues. For the Blake Edwards fans out there is there a better monologue than William Holden's speech which in many ways was his own obituary  in S.O.B. another of Black Edwards' great films that hardly anyone seems to appreciate.Okay. I'm finished. I think Sunset is a very fine movie. If what you are looking for are car chases piles of corpses slapstick sex and special effects this is NOT your movie.

By comparison Sunset is a weak film.But it is a good Blake Edwards film and good Edwards Blind Date Curse of the Pink Panther is much better than horrible Edwards Switch Bring Your Smile Along Justin Case. Sunset is Edwards' attempt at a risky genre film noir which if handled wrong gives us films such as Palmetto. When handled right the results can be very entertaining.Sunset is indeed very entertaining. It has laughs but they're not important here. The atmosphere is what's important here and Edwards drenches us in it. And his casting of James Garner and Bruce Willis is inspired and right. They work wonderfully together  and it is a testament to Garner and Willis as actors that they are so utterly believable as Wyatt Earp and Tom Mix respectively. The bigger surprise here is Willis who has a fresh faced charm that he doesn't show all that much anymore. I had forgotten what a solid actor he really is beneath that cliched ACTION STAR persona.What prevents Sunset from approaching greatness is that Edwards is weighed down by the plot. He wants to create a complex mystery and he achieves that. But after getting to know such rich and likable characters I really wish he had just forgotten about the plot and focus on them. All of his very best films are about character. Look at the list in the beginning. Each and every one of those films has characters we care about and he wisely forgets about resolving the plot. He observes and that's how he gets our attention and laughs where appropriate. I only wished he had remembered. Luckily his next film Skin Deep remembered that.I still recommend Sunset if only for the charm of Willis and Garner and that wonderful atmosphere. This isn't a great film but you just can't resist smiling at the end. out of 4 stars".

Sunset is a fictionized account of the meeting of two famous cowboys Marshal Wyatt Eurp and Western film star Tom Mix. This is the second time that James Garner played Wyatt Eurp as he played the part in John Sturges' underrated film Hour Of the Gun which told the story of what happened after the famous Gunfight at The O.K. Corral. Though in that film Garner played him very downbeat and here he is his usual likeable cowboy.Eurp and Mix played by Bruce Willis in his second staring filmgetting involved in an complicated mystery involving a Studio head played by Malcom McDowell playing a sort of evil Charlie Chaplin. It's not only the wonderful chemistry between th two stars that makes the film enjoyable but it's all the situations that they go thru.Also a high point in the film is the score by master composer Henry Mancini. Mancini has score most of Director Blake Edwards films since they first teamed up on the TV show Peter Gunn. Here Mancini shows why he was such a great composer adaptable to any film genre his western theme is as good as anything done by Elmer Bernstein and Dimitri Tiomkin two of the highly regarded composers of western movies.While parts of the film are a little uneven and Director Edward should have not casted his daughter Jennifer Edwards in such a crucial role. She was totally miscast as McDowell's sister. She worked much better in Edwards S.O.B. and That's Life and even more in a film not directed by her dad called The Perfect Match.The main reason to watch this film is that it's fun and it's fun watching two legends getting together I mean both Garner and Willis as well as the real men they portray Erup and Mix and remember like the film says it's all true give or take a lie or two.".

If you want to see him step out of the Western role there are many opportunities including Frankenheimer's Grand Prix probably the definitive motorsports movie ever made along with Le Mans featuring another tough guy sometimes antihero Steve McQueen. Nonetheless Garner is a true cinema treasure and this is fun murder mystery is too good to pass up. Two thumbs up way up.".

	schema:headline " Is There a More Likable Leading Man than James Garner";
	schema:reviewBody "I cannot remember a time since I was eight that James Garner hasn't completely won me over. His easy mix of handsome leading man charm and skill as a movie actor has made him a favorite of mine for more than 45 years. Only Cary Grant can match that. Garner throughout his long and productive career has succeeded in doing what John Wayne could notmake consistently interesting films. The Americanization of Emily VictorVictoria helmed by Blake Edwards and costarring Julie Andrews The Thrill of it All The Great Escape Murphy's Romance are all movies I love and have watched over and over again. Few actors have as consistently good body of work as Garner. Even in weaker films such as The Children's Hour or or Grand Prix Garner manages to hold them together. I don't know who came up with the inspired casting of Garner and Willis but the results are just wonderful here. Wyatt Earp and Tom Mix solving a murder romancing the ladies using their brains and their charm to get them in and out of trouble can make for a very enjoyable movie. I was a huge fan of the first two seasons of Moonlighting and Willis must be given a huge amount of credit for the incredible chemistry he had with Cybill Shepherd. Willis has brought that charm to other roles such as Nobody's Fool and especially Bandits. That charm can turn to smirkiness that the critics so often jump on him about. His Tom Mix is one cool dude. Everyone's best friend the guy you can always count on Willis is adorable rash and ready. He makes up his mind that Wyatt Earp is someone He can respect. He admires Earp's livedin cool and he knows something is always going to happen around this legendary lawman. Willis even manages to pull off one outrageous western costume after another The hats are huge as mountain tops the shirts are colorful the chaps are as wide as Montana. It's a tribute to Willis' ability to sell the character of Tom Mix without being swamped by all the fabric he's hauling around. Garner's easy affability makes watching them a real pleasure. Mariel Hemingway and Kathleen Quinlan as their girls are also well cast. The biggest problem is the casting of Malcom McDowell as the dark and sinister film producer Alfie Alperin. On the surface this is a part that McDowell could have phone increepy controlling violent and threatening. But McDowell seems bored right from the start. There's no spark or real inspiration for this bad boy and Jennifer Edwards as his lame sister is equally miscast. All the bad guys are real clichs here. The final showdown between Earp Mix and their McDowell's now completely unbelievable villain goes on too long and you know every step of the way before the film reveals the heavy handed plot. Henry Mancini's big western score is tuneful and memorable as any written by experts in the genre and show off his huge versatility. Up the final denouement Garner and Willis make you remember why buddy pictures can be so much fun. I happen to love Blake Edwards filmsalways have. The best are just really really good. Most of SUNSET is very very good.".

I had never seen the film before but had always been interested because of the two leads and the era in which the film is set the late 1920s.I enjoyed the film quite a bit actually. I thought the story was very good and well written and Garner and Willis made a great team. I especially enjoyed Willis' characterization of Tom Mix. He brought just the right amount of cowboy style to the silen movie hero. And of course Garner is always good. But he really excelled as Wyatt Earp.I thought the premise was very original and that the whole film was a lot of fun.With one exception. Why is the villain of this piece so obviously supposed to remind us of Charley Chaplin ? Alvy Alperin ? Formerly known as The Happy Hobo ? A clear reference to Chaplin and his little tramp. And yet the character is an abuseive rapist and murderer who beats his own wife to death.Why Edwards chose to virtually villify one of the most talented and entertaining comedians of the silent era who was also a fairly nice bloke in real life if a bit of a womanizer I do not know.The other original characters in the film that is character who are fictional rather than historical like Earp and Mix are very wellcrafted believable and completely original. No single character seems to be a rip on any single individual in Hollywood at the time except for Malcolm McDowall's Alperin.As a fan of Chaplin Normand Arbuckle and the great silent clowns I found this to be a strong defect in the overall film. I can definitely believe Tom Mix as a hero. But I simply cannot reconcile even a thinly renamed Chaplin with a bully and a rapist.I wonder why Edwards didn't go the extra mile to make the Alperin character more original.Aside from this point which is a big one really the film is a lot of fun for fans of the period and the leads.".

Of interest also is Mariel Hemingway who is quite good as needing woman. The main problem with the film is that the mystery is rather dull and its implementation into the plot comes at the cost of sacrificing room for further character development. Blake's directing work is slightly heavyhanded here full of silly spectacles and violence that add little flavour to the film  and his work directing the film won him a Razzie award.

	schema:headline " You're a long way from Tombstone Marshal.";
	schema:reviewBody "More than the actual story itself what intrigued me about this picture was the way it mashed together historical elements at the turn of the silent era in Hollywood. At the time Tom Mix was a genuine movie legend and he lived a lavish lifestyle that the picture barely touches on. The story references Mix as having made his last silent film and he's about to appear in a picture about the Gunfight at the OK Corral on which Wyatt Earp has been called in to be a technical adviser. In real life Earp did become friends with Tom Mix and another veteran silent film star William S. Hart.The setting for the film is 1929 with the very first year of the Academy Awards serving as a backdrop to the murder mystery at the center of the story. The event was held on May 16th and Earp was already deceased for four months. It's unlikely an eighty year old Earp would have been running around Los Angeles getting involved with crooked cops and hookers though I wouldn't put it past Mix. Even so Mix would have been fifty himself and it was getting harder with each passing year to get up on a horse.As cowboy star Tom Mix Bruce Willis gets to wear some outrageously colorful outfits and drive some of the best looking vintage vehicles I've ever seen. Mix had a free spending lifestyle and Willis's reference in the picture to owning sixteen cars was probably pretty close to the mark. Content with portraying Mix as a rather hip and fashionable playboy no mention is made that he was married five times in real life. Just as well it wouldn't have worked for the story at all.For his part James Garner does a competent job as former marshal Wyatt Earp now a private citizen and working as a consultant in Hollywood. I like Garner and if you're going for a buddy teamup the chemistry between himself and Willis is enjoyable. However the script calls for an affable Earp and from what I've read about the real life lawman Garner's portrayal seems out of character here. Which is OK just not very believable. But we already established that.The main villain of the piece is portrayed by Malcolm McDowell in a thinly based caricature of Charlie Chaplin. A number of reviewers on this board opine on why director Edwards would have tarnished Chaplin's reputation with such an obvious parody Happy HoboLittle Tramp. It may simply have been a way to include another Academy 'first' in the proceedings. Chaplin was honored that year with a special award for his all around contribution to producing The Circus.Another reviewer puzzles over the title of the movie. Personally having seen hundreds of TV and movie Westerns it's probably a convenient way to memorialize just about every B oater in which the cowboy star gets the girl at the end of the picture and rides off into the proverbial sunset. But then again in researching the first Academy gathering in 1929 one learns that the Best Picture winner for 'Unique and Artistic Production' went to Fox Studio's Sunrise. So if this was another overt accolade to the original Oscars it was cleverly done.I guess I'd like to close out by mentioning one more bit of trivia regarding Tom Mix and Wyatt Earp. The last surviving brother of the infamous Gunfight at the OK Corral died on January 13th 1929. His pallbearers were all prominent men from Los Angeles and Hollywood including friends William S. Hart and Tom Mix. Newspaper accounts of the occasion state that Mix cried at the funeral.".

Personally having seen hundreds of TV and movie Westerns it's probably a convenient way to memorialize just about every B oater in which the cowboy star gets the girl at the end of the picture and rides off into the proverbial sunset. But then again in researching the first Academy gathering in 1929 one learns that the Best Picture winner for 'Unique and Artistic Production' went to Fox Studio's Sunrise. So if this was another overt accolade to the original Oscars it was cleverly done.I guess I'd like to close out by mentioning one more bit of trivia regarding Tom Mix and Wyatt Earp. The last surviving brother of the infamous Gunfight at the OK Corral died on January 13th 1929. His pallbearers were all prominent men from Los Angeles and Hollywood including friends William S. Hart and Tom Mix. Newspaper accounts of the occasion state that Mix cried at the funeral.";

I was expecting standard Blake Edwards fare which for me means mostly enjoyable usually ranking about a 7 of 10 but instead was treated to an engaging cinematic odyssey. This movie has everything it is a western it is a romance it is adventure it is a crime drama it even has horses car chases and a biplane not to mention the stunning art deco scenery. And western scenery. Add in the fabulous shots of Mix's Duesenbergs and what's not to love.Malcolm McDowell is sublime as the villain James Garner is charming as the sidekick and Bruce Willis is truly at his best here in an unusual role not playing Bruce Willis. Not a great film by Academy standards but an enjoyable way to spend a couple hours. Beautiful silly intriguing...all in one movie. Splendid eh?".

	schema:reviewBody "I appreciate Sunset the film because it gave the man who I consider the best big screen Wyatt Earp James Garner a chance to reprise the role.Garner played Earp back in the mid sixties in John Sturges's Hour of the Gun. That film took the unusual plot line of beginning with the famous Gunfight at the OK Corral and showing the aftermath from that event. It was a pretty grim western and Garner was not playing his usual likable con artist.It took twenty years from Hour of the Gun to Sunset but it was over 40 years in real life from the OK Corral fight until the events of Sunset that take place in Hollywood in and around the first Academy Award dinner in 1928. Wyatt Earp was in fact in Hollywood and did in fact know Tom Mix. Earp died in 1929 at the age 80 and Garner is one of the liveliest 80 year olds ever on screen.Blake Edwards must have hated Charles Chaplin because Malcolm McDowell as Alfie Alperin the Happy Hobo and villain of the film is one loathsome creep. No doubt Chaplin's character is used as the basis for McDowell's. The famous Thomas Ince shooting on board a yacht is also worked into the plot. Topping all that the first Academy Award dinner had a triple homicide in the lobby.Bruce Willis as Tom Mix stars as Wyatt Earp in a film about the OK Corral and of course with Wyatt still being alive Garner is brought in as a technical adviser. The two of them get involved in a lovely web of intrigue during end of the silent era that starts with the murder of a bordello madam who had a lot of blackmail information concerning the mighty of Tinseltown. Wyatt Earp discovers a few personal facts about himself he didn't know also.Patricia Hodge is McDowell's long suffering wife and Jennifer Edwards is his equally loathsome sister. Another pair that Willis and Garner have to deal with are Richard Bradford as a corrupt LA detective and M. Emmet Walsh as the studio cop who do a lot of McDowell's dirty work.Sunset is entertaining enough not a great film for either Willis or Garner. And it does capture the ambiance of old Hollywood give or take a lie or two.".

In the film he's quite young and at the top of his career. James Garner plays Wyatt Earp who's hired as a technical advisor for Mix's films. Earp would have been 80 Garner is 60 and he died in 1929. This film is like that it mixes reality with fantasy to no purpose. Why are Mix and Earp the main characters in a story that could NEVER have happened? Why bother using reallife people?They get involved in a murder at a bordello which gets them on the wrong side of Los Angeles' crooked police force and a sadistic movie mogul and former acrobatic comedian named Alperin Malcolm McDowell who is clearly patterned on Charlie Chaplin for no reason at all.Alperin's battered and wan wife Patricia Hodge made up to look as much like Julie Andrews as possible has a secret and she's an oldtime friend of Earp's. It seems her son Dermot Mulroney may have committed the bordello murder. Earp gets involved with a hostess at the bordello Mariel Hemingway who's connected to the murder victim. The cops say they were a lesbian couple.The film tries to add humor in the mismatched buddies Mix and Earp as they tool around Hollywood in one of Mix's 16 custommade cars. Mix is sorta sweet on Alperin's production assistant Kathleen Quinlan who is imperiled by the murder investigation which also involves a gangster.Director Blake Edwards tries to hit upon almost every Hollywood scandal and story from the silent era. which equates to a mixedup mess of a movie whose plot is all over the lot. There's whisps of the William Desmond Taylor murder the Roscoe Arbuckle murder scandal and the Thomas Ince murder.There's a scene involving the first Academy Awards ceremony which is wrong in just about every detail. It was actually held at a brunch at the Roosevelt Hotel not a dinner with hordes of fans as at a movie premiere. In another scene Alperin warns Mix that Fox and Chaplin were toying with talkies. By 1929 all of the studios were producing talkies and Chaplin was a famous holdout not making his first talkie until 1939!Very few real stars are mentioned in any context. The bordello specializes in Hollywood lookalikes and features Greta Garbo and Mae West with mention of Janet Gaynor Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish. The cast lists actors playing Douglas Fairbanks John Gilbert James Cagney Thelma Todd and Oliver Hardy but I never noticed them and they were not mentioned. They may have been cut from the final print.And then there's the army of stunt doubles who so obviously do all the action scenes fights and anything deemed dangerous. They are painfully obvious.Might have looked good on paper but the end result is a big dud. Garner also reported hated working with Willis which explains why there's zero chemistry between them.".

Perhaps the film's makers weren't sure that he had the pulling power to carry a film on his own because he shares much of the screen time with costar James Garner who provides an altogether more memorable character as Wyatt Earp  who is either the sprightliest octogenarian you've ever seen or has mastered the art of time travel.Earp is invited to Hollywood to act as technical adviser on his biopic in which Tom Mix Willis will play his part. Studio mogul McDowell 'asks' Mix to befriend Earp a chore against which he initially bridles. For a while it looks as if we're going to be faced with another of those buddy movies in which two disparate characters manage to overcome their initial mutual loathing in order to catch the villain and become best friends in the process but Mix and Earp's mutual admiration is almost immediate and they quickly get down to business when McDowell's wife an old friend of Earp's asks the lawman for help.Writerdirector Edwards throws a few twists into an otherwise straightforward plot and there's nothing here to really gripe about. The budget precludes any real depth to the period detail and Edwards only halfheartedly weaves real incidents from Hollywood history into the mix. McDowell's character Alfie Alperin who was once a film character called the Happy Hobo is not so much based on Charlie Chaplin as a completely different character to Chaplin based on some aspects of the comic's life. We discover Alperin murdered his wife aboard a yacht an incident which inevitably draws comparisons with Chaplin's exploits aboard William Randolph Hearst's yacht in 1924 which culminated in the death of director Thomas Harper Ince only for those comparisons to be found to be tenuous in the extreme. The finale takes place at the inaugural Academy Awards ceremony and flies off in a complete flight of fancy that ties up all loose ends while curiously failing to offer much satisfaction to the viewer.As a sidenote I watched this film a couple of hours after watching The Milagro Beanfield War. Both films were made in 1988 and both feature Richard Bradford as a bad guy supported by the wonderfully weaselly M. Emmett Walsh. Bradford was better in Milagro but Walsh gets more screen time here and makes the most of it.".

The premise of Tom Mix and Wyatt Earp buddying up to work on a Hollywood movie in 1929 makes a nice playground for a movie and although the characters are very thinly drawn and the acting mostly tepid there is also some satisfaction of finding the bad guys really bad and the good guys really good. Bruce Willis plays the Hollywood hero Tom Mix with plenty of sardonic selfconscious cool but James Garner really brings it home as Wyatt Earp the historical hero.As with most of Edwards movies the supporting players are as important as the leads. Malcom McDowell does another turn as the delightfully twisted director and Mariel Hemmingway  who many times has delivered her part woodenly is a pleasant surprise aided by Garner's megawatt charisma. The movie is being produced by the dastardly husband of an old love of Earps and Earp and Mix get entangled in movie studio shenanigans murder madams and deep secrets. This is all done with the backdrop of the glitz and glamour of the old Hollywood studios the richest of the rich and lowest of the low. Just seeing the wardrobes and cars of the era are worth the time spent watching the movie. Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

And what I expected to be nothing more than a real fledgeling of a film with only a glimmer of the Van Sant that attracts many to his work was in actuality a stunning fully sustained episodic and tender Kapow! that was wonderfully made and full of all the visual tricks and flair that makes Van Sants movies so idiosyncratic and so ... well him. This was the biggest delight for me about it. I expected simply because it is so hard to find and that it has no DVD release that it would be a mere trifle of a film. But it is anything but.I was moved all the acting was topnotch. The main character was likeably deluded such a victim of his own desire it was funny and warming at the same time. The Black and White and evident grain in occasional sound inconsistencies actually work for it it helps draw the detail out of the locale and its people in a manner very reminiscent of Van Sants Idaho and Drugstore Cowboy. There are moments of confusion of randomness of erotica and tragedy. The music is wonderful every camera angle delicately crafted but never contrived or pretentious full of humour and warmth. What a joy this film was and to me seriously one of Van Sants best. Maybe its because I'm a gay man and with the exclusion of his Paris Je Teme segment and elements of My Own Private Idaho this is his only overtly gay story. And it plays real with an almost documentary like realism for example the scenes of language barriers between the the main protagonist and Pepper but then again its almost as theatrical as opera playing it broad and surreal. I cant praise it highly enough. A real surprise a delight. I hope it gets seen.".

That is the subtitle for this movie and it does tell one side of the story.  Another side involves the randomness of life in Portland a city that's more like an overgrown small town with a big seamy underbelly and lots of folks eking out an existence on the margins.  This movie shows with subtly limned images and snatches of wry realistic dialogue just how vast and differentiated the landscape of the margins is in this town. And maybe too in that weird district of the Twilight Zone known as America.Twilight is a state of mind that provides the true setting for this story that seems to be a fragment of a greater whole but nevertheless has its own peculiar beauty.  The black and white photography is stunning and seductive and perfect for the film noir desperation occasionally melodramatic but never posturing with which these characters seem to run their lives. The director uses chiaroscuro the play of light and shadow over the faces and bodies of his players to hint at people's emotions or to suggest the cluelessness with which they get through the day.  Despite the sense of general confusion there are poignant and powerful emotions that surface here thanks to the skillfully nuanced photography and the expressiveness of the actors.The casting is perfect but among the actors only Tim Streeter really seems to give a coherently thoughtthrough performance.  Streeter to judge from his performance here is an actor of brilliance and considerable sensitivityit's sad that his only other credit is a 1987 appearance on 21 Jump Street.  A lot of the shots in the movie are composed with great inventiveness but the visual beauty that results never feels arty or contrived mainly because of the gritty realities that encompass the characters' lives and passions.Certain scenes in this movie made me think of images that surface in the songs of indie bard Elliott Smith whose music was used in Gus van Sant's much glitzier mainstream movie Good Will Hunting.  Images of lonely people smoking late nights away over cheap beers in loud bars waiting for their sense of woundedness to dull sufficiently so that they can go back out on the street and face some semblance of life again. The use of music is yet another element that gives Mala Noche a distinctive flavorthe music credits cover several  screens at the end of the movieas one would expect with a director who is also a composer and musician in his own right.Poetic frail fragmentary and haunting this is one of those movies where even if you never quite get the story certain images from it will nevertheless linger a long time in your memory after you have seen it.".

It's not about anything other than the passion felt by Walt a store clerk played by Tim Streeter for Johnny a young Mexican tearaway with little or no English who acknowledges his feelings but doesn't reciprocate them. Its freewheeling unfettered sensibility has made it a seminal film for both Independent and New Queer Cinema and it's a lot more likable and perversely more accessible than most of Van Sant's later output. It also makes great use of TexMex music and the 'nonperformances' of the three boys who take centre stage have an offthewall quality that has nothing to do with 'acting' but feels nicely naturalistic. All three boys are actually quite engaging in their disparate ways. Short sharp and sweet.".

It's touching sad and frustrating to watch as Walt keeps throwing himself at Johnny and is constantly rebuffed. Walt who is the caregiver to just about everyone he meets spouts life philosophy and seems to enjoy the thrill of the chase in the gritty side of town. At the same time it's refreshing to see a film from 20 years ago treat gay characters and relationships with respect and to give them normal lines without resorting to stereotypes. Oddly Ray Monge who plays Roberto a friend of Johnny is the only one has has had more than one or two roles listed in their career and he has just four roles listed. Some neat little touches like the bottle on a string that pulls the door closed like a spring Walt greeting everyone on the street and the driving lesson gone wrong. Interesting interview with van Sant on the DVD from janusCriterion where he explains how it was made from Curtis' story. A little offbeat and rough but fun to watch.".

As a native Portuguese speaker English is my second language it's funny for me to realize that those beautifulsounding words mean plainly bad night.

Shot in blackandwhite 16MM for only 25000 the film lacks the wholesomeness of Van Sant's following movies more notably his masterpiece My Own Private Idaho 1991. The acting varies from mediocre Streeter to plain bad Cooyeate and most of the supporting cast but in spite of the below par actors and the extremely low budget Van Sant managed to create some beautiful scenes already demonstrating his raw sense of streetlife poetry.

	schema:headline " A Milestone In American Gay Cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "As the stagnant state of films in the 1980's was still in its inevitable decline the emergence of a new breed of American independent directors saw this as a moment full of opportunity. Gus Van Sant decided to turn his camera on the outcasts of a small Portland neighborhood and create an intimate portrait of 3 young men at an important turning point in their lives. Not only is Mala Noche an influential example of 1980's independent cinema it also serves as a milestone for the New Queer Cinema that would become more prevalent in the 1990's. Gus Van Sant's stark debut would serve as a blueprint for many directors to come. Mala Noche focuses on convenience store worker Walt's and his infatuation with a young immigrant Jonny who is fresh off riding the rails from Mexico with his friend Pepper. From the film's first scene its unabashed open gayness lets the viewer know what they are in for. Van Sant makes no attempt to justify his films openly gay stance instead he embraces it and explores the beauty and darkness that accompany it. Walt and Johnny coexist solely based on their parasitic relationship. Walt gushes romanticized convictions for a boy he knows little about such as I want to drink this Mexican boy or I have to show him that I'm gay for him. While Johnny uses Walt for a house to crash and the occasional joy ride in his car. At the same time both are uncomfortable with their personal situation but can't help to hold on to what they have left.John Campbell's bleak camera work adds a lot to the look of the seedy underbelly of Portland almost as if it could have been shot as a documentary. Mala Noche is one the few films that benefits from working on such a small budget. It gives the viewer a sense that Van Sant was truly in touch on a deeper level with his subjects than just an actordirector level. Ultimately Mala Noche is a profound representation of America's emerging gay cinema and an important document of Portland in the mid 1980's. Gus Van Sant would go onto make stronger films but this fascinating debut will show he has shown a strong passion for his films and his subjects right from the beginning.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been more than twenty years since Gus Van Sant released his first fulllength feature film. For a first film Mala Noche avoids many of the pitfalls other first films usually exhibit. The screenplay is realistic and the camera work is impressive. So despite its age the film is still worth a viewing.Mala Noche is a social realisminspired drama about the life Walt Curtis. Curtis is a shopkeeper from Portland Oregon and he falls in love with a Mexican immigrant named Johnny. The film covers Walt's effort to befriend Johnny his brother Roberto and his brothers. Walt is never able to sleep with Johnny as he wishes he could but ironically has sex several times with Roberto.The most striking feature of Mala Noche is the realism of its lead character and the main supporting cast. Walt exhibits the characteristics of a poor young man. He works in a remedial job and lives in a rundown apartment. His attraction to Johnny is not romantic but visceral. His voiceover narration describes his anguish as he fails in seducing Johnny. This adds a provocative flair to Walt's character. It allows us to sympathize with him because he is so frank about his problem that we wish for him to succeed. Similarly Johnny and Roberto also act appropriately given their roles. Johnny uses his status as an immigrant and his knowledge of Walt's homosexuality to manipulate him into giving away products at his store. Roberto also manipulates Walt but for sexual purposes. Perhaps the best example of the incredible realism of the film is Roberto's inability to admit to his affair with Walt. I cannot recall another film which portrays a secret homosexual relationship as earnestly as this one does. Most films including those in support of homosexuality display it in a sensationalized way. Mala Noche earns marks for originality by showing that homosexuality is just a part of life even though it isn't public.For a budget of 25000 Van Sant has created a wellconstructed film. The lighting is from practicals or appears to be but this adds to the film's realism. This may interfere with your ability to see the characters but at least a portion of an actor's face is always visible. There are no special effects beyond the lighting. There are several shots of nature which appear beautiful despite the lack of color. Budget constraints prevented more elaborate effects and Van Sant probably stretched his stipend out filming the few colored scenes. This doesn't affect the film's quality and adds appropriateness to it.All isn't perfect with this debut. With its paltry running time the film isn't able to develop a real exposition. The first sequence is Walt narrating his attraction to Johnny. This is representative of a larger concern in the film's plot progression the episodic nature of its events. However realistic it appears to a viewer he may find it difficult to understand what is happening in subsequent sequences. It warrants another viewing. A noteworthy example is when Johnny temporarily steals Walt's car. We are given no plausible explanation for the specific reason why he wants to confiscate the car at that moment. Again this is a byproduct of a 78minute running time and not the direct fault of Van Sant.Mala Noche has become a cult classic especially in youth culture. While most cult films are exploitative Mala Noche has achieved its status for the opposite reason. This is an optimistic film about the possibility of people to interact without bias for country of origin or sexual preference. While the film is highly reflective of the sexual anguish of the young it is challenging to connect the disjointed sequences into a coherent film. The film has no direction and moves continuously forward like a Magical Realism novel but lacks the characterization to keep the story afloat. Still Mala Noche is worth watching for the purposeful lack of chemistry between its protagonist and his love interest. Walt cannot become Johnny's lover regardless of how much emasculating effort he makes. Despite their shared minority classification they are still able to befriend one another. The film presents a faux relationship between two young men in a nontraditional way and this makes it an excellent candidate for Netflix.The newest DVD edition of the film is worth a purchase if you enjoy Van Sant's work. It features an interview with him and a trailer of the film. The subtitles are only sporadically placed when Spanish is spoken and they remain on screen only briefly.".

In this case the main character Walt Tim Streeter falls desperately in love with a Mexican boy Doug Cooeyate and the whole film is a small journey into following the many dumb attempts of Johnny catching the boy's attention and affection often refused or played against him. In a humdrum town where almost nothing ever happens this 16 yearold kid coming into Walt's store is a big event in his life everything seems to change. He sees as a positive thing we as audience don't. He's too absorbed and infatuated with this boy who doesn't speak his language but understand his moves on him to which he avoids time and time again yet he's always there to help him or help his friends  in one of those lucky days he manages to sleep with one of them. Nothing good comes from those acts yet he's obstinate headstrong is a more suitable adjective definitely a pigheaded. That's what life is all about. That's what romantic novels pop songs and so many films teaches us never give up on the one you love. However the limit established here is there's always a time to stop move with your life and analyze better what you're doing. One can't find someone else to love and adore.Crude a little humorous though with a very imperceptible humor sorely depressing sad as a whole. Mala Noche Bad Night is less of a love story and more of a desperate run to find a true love but it all goes to show the embarrassing ways of getting to someone who's only interested in taking advantage of this person. Tim is almost like Cabiria always waiting for the love of her life except he goes after this kid who pushes him away changes of subject teases him a bit. He doesn't realize he's confusing love with lust. It's an excellent film debut for Gus Van Sant but also a strange one certainly. He doesn't crave for our attention he gets it quite easily by telling a very simple story in a simple way engaging despite the whole melancholia and on a nonhurried short time 70 minutes and in a stylistically blackandwhite always uncertain and darker just like the characters hidden intentions occulting the foreseeable sense of danger. It's not all sadness there's some great erotic scenes amazingly wellfilmed despite its restrained conventions with the lack of color. But here's something why would someone would like to expose that story to an audience of watchers and readers  this was based on an autobiographical novel by Walt Curtis  or let me say this better why would someone would like to expose his tragedy for others to see? I say that both Sant and Curtis by sharing this with us are following D.H.Lawrence or Rainer Werner Fassbinder's school of thought to use art to say this is what will happen if you follow into this direction. They reprehend and advise without doing so a warning sign that isn't preachy or too moral like the classical literatures and the Hays Code movies that's why I like those works. That's the primal and ultimate purpose and value no more and no less. It isn't the jolliest of the experiences but it's a powerful and effective artistic expression. And of course it's Independent Cinema at its greatest being real humane convincing and authorial. 1010".

The guys who were cast as the young Mexican homeless boys were HORRIBLE! Spanish is my first language and I could tell that the actors who portrayed JOhny and Robert were not fluent at all in Spanish which for this film it is a MAJOR point since they re supposed not to speak English. I guess that explains the reason why when Johny had dialogue the camera was not on him and the times when he spoke and the camera was on him there was no sync. I am 100 percent sure that they used someone else's voice  a bad actor's at that to do the voice over for Johny. For someone who speaks Spanish it was PAINFUL to listen to the monotone emotiondeprived delivery of the lines. I don't know under what circumstances these two horrible actors were cast but I am sure the director did not do a thorough audition process to get the best actors. The actor who played Robert was better at ATTEMPTING to sound better in Spanish. I still don't know if he was fluent in Spanish which it sounds like he was. And if he was then he was just saying the grammatically incorrect lines given to him by the director without complaining about not being correct. One of the examples is when he is being harassed by the white guy. Roberto says Para. No me molesto. Translated that means  Stop. It doesn't bother me.or  Stop. I don't get bothered. Im sure the intention of the writer was  Stop. Don't bother me which should've been Para. No me molestes. The only character that spoke good Spanish was the guy who was telling the story of how they crossed the border. And I could bet the reason that being is because probably he really went thru that and he was just being interviewed  he did not NEED to actI doubt that was scripted. That part when he's talking it totally threw me out of the movie because it had a documentary feel to it and then to go back into the bad acting was like disconnected. Among other thingsit was torture when they had the Spanish speakers dialogue on the background. They kept on repeating the same dialogue over and over and over again! same lines over and over! I guess it would work for nonSpanish speakers because they just hear a foreign language and they have no idea whats being said. But when you understand the language you get so frustrated that you wanna throw a shoe at the TV and make it shut up. I really like Gus Van Sant's directing but I have no idea and im very curious to know what pressed or forced Mr Gus Van Sant to cast these horrible actors. Was it pressure from the producers or did he honestly think these guys were the BEST?".

From the opening shots in the box car as the two Mexican friends sneak across the border shadows play upon their faces emphasizing the fear and excitement that these guys must feel. It is surprising to hear this called a low budget film Mala Noche has the look of a polished and professional film. Blockbusters such as Sin City with their huge budgets attempted to achieve the look of this one and failed. The story is simple and takes a back seat to the imagery. A normallooking guy in his 20's develops a crush on one of the young Mexican immigrants who spends his days hanging around the Portland streets near the gringo's shop. Walt professes his love to 18 year old Johnny. However the fact that they don't speak the same language and have nothing in common make this more a case of sexual lust. Johnny who has no interest in men lets Walt into his life if only for the benefits of some free food cash and rides around the city. It is quite sad and tragic to witness the Mexican boy treating Walt so cruelly but Walt's behavior is not much better treating the boy like a piece of meat by offering him 15 for sex. After being rejected and abandoned by Johnny Walt finds himself in a shaky relationship with Johnny's best friend Roberto. When Roberto enters the picture the film gets even better. It is interesting to witness how these two outcasts relate as they struggle to understand each others worlds. Roberto played by Ray Monge is more likable than the hardened Johnny and possesses this quality that makes you want to take care of him. When he becomes sick Walt does just that and this is the most unforgettable thing about Mala Noche. This is one of the very few gaythemed films that is actually cool and not embarrassing to watch. Van Sant made the surprising and wise decision to make Walt a totally normal straightacting straightlooking guy. Most films present gays in the typical stereotype feminine looking and acting men appearing foolish and camp. Of course the best thing about Van Sant's debut film is it's style and the phenomenal way he uses black and white to portray mood. Each frame could be cut out and hung on the wall it is that beautiful. This is the true definition of cult cinema. Finally available after years of obscurity this is now available on a high quality DVD featuring razorsharp picture quality and good sound. For fans of Van Sants earlier work Mala Noche is a mustsee film. Also those who remember Portland in the 80's will get a kick out of all the street scenes featuring locals who mostly seem to like drinking Night Train. Mala Noche is a classic..".

	schema:headline " A classy film debut";
	schema:reviewBody "'Mala Noche' is a classy movie mostly filmed in blackandwhite about an Oregon young gay shop worker Walt who falls in love with a vagrant and illegal migrant a young Mexican lad Johnny. And how does he fall in love! He gets run in by the scheming young man and his other illegal migrant Mexican buddies but is blinded by his feelings for the lad. They move in with Walt taking over his apartment. To make matters worse they don't speak English and nor does he speak Spanish. While he chirps pleasantries to his new onesided love they make fun of him the puto queer Grinko. That while they are happily abusing his hospitality. But how would it end for our naive lover?The acting by Tim Streeter as Walt and DougCooeyate Ray Monge and Sam Downey as the Mexicans is excellent. The cinematography is particularly good and some of the best I have ever seen with any blackandwhite film. The contrast between dark and light is stark and enhances the film's arthouse qualities.I had a look at the interview made with Van Sant 20 years after completion of the film that accompanies the DVD and it is quite illuminating. Van Sand made this movie his first serious attempt at filmmaking on a meagre 20000 budget. He could not afford the much more expensive colour film and had to settle for blackandwhite. He could not afford the large numbers of expensive lights needed and had to settle with only one light for his many indoor shots. That explains the stark contrast between dark and light with little gray inbetween. Although not intentional it in my view made the photography even better. I score this impressive indie film an excellent 810.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Mala Noche' is a classy movie mostly filmed in blackandwhite about an Oregon young gay shop worker Walt who falls in love with a vagrant and illegal migrant a young Mexican lad Johnny. And how does he fall in love! He gets run in by the scheming young man and his other illegal migrant Mexican buddies but is blinded by his feelings for the lad. They move in with Walt taking over his apartment. To make matters worse they don't speak English and nor does he speak Spanish. While he chirps pleasantries to his new onesided love they make fun of him the puto queer Grinko. That while they are happily abusing his hospitality.

It was about time to finally check out the Criterion Van Sant titles and while not on the Criterion DVD today I saw Mala Noche and I will renting as soon as I can the Criterion DVD of My Own Private Idaho which is one of the most acclaimed films of Van Sant. And by the way if you go to the website of Criterion you will find the lists of favourite Criterion titles of people like Richard Linklater John Lurie.

	schema:reviewBody "Mr. Van Sant I just watched your film Mala Noche and I found it really sad and appalling that such a spectacular piece of art was so blatantly racist and bigoted. I was at first enthralled by the dark images and experimental camera work style and transitions. I loved the way you played with space on the screen forcing the viewers to search for the flickers of light that would break up the pitch black searching for information letting oneself be guided by the narration to make sense of the powerful images. I liked how the camera like the viewer would slowly pan and search the space for meaning finally resting on a subject and slowly revealing meaning. However no matter how great a piece of art it could never justify racism and bigoted statements. I was deeply offended how the character of your film would spit out these horrible statements like 'The Mexicans were stupid that's why they were there on the corner looking for work' just to mention one example. I was really upset not just by the bigoted statements of the main character but also how the characters were displayed as buffoons constantly making fools of themselves with no real character depth. All characters of color in your film were portrayed as subhumans who's purpose in life was merely as distractions to Walt the intellectual and the only responsible reasonable and cultured person in the film. To justify the racism of film by saying that your character Walt is the racist and you were just trying to portray the reality of the time period in Organ is no excuse. It was no excuse for skin heads and the Nazi film makers in the 40's and it is no excuse today. The only way a film maker could legitimately portray the reality of racism in a film is to either provide feedback through other voices or through actions and behavior of other characters in the film to negate the racist statements and show the reality that the characters views are just racist views of the character and not statements made by the film. You do non of that in Male Noche and the actions and behaviors of the characters of color only prove the racist statements of Walt as truth. I watched your interviews and searched online to find interviews where you would at least acknowledge or apologize for overt racism of the film but I was further disappointed when I found nothing. Your film Mala Noche in my book will be remembered in film history as the first bigoted and racist gay film and not as a true piece of art.".

This time we are confronted with a very different product. This movie starts very quietly directed very evenly by Giorgio Diritti a car drives through gorgeous sceneries Italy the Piamonte region valleys mountains incredibly majestic setting and a zigzagging road bordering a deep abyss and we are introduced to a couple of natives within the car discussing the selling or renting of one of the properties in this small village Ussolo within the valley Maira that once in 1900 had 1.000 inhabitants and nowadays no more than 50? to a french cheese maker. At first the quite old natives are very enthusiastic about the new arrival since the village is almost dead everybody left it long ago to look for better lives in faraway places and they make plans thinking that the cheese maker could be a good addition to the summer months when the tourists will come In winter the weather is very bitter and the snow covers everything. The film develops this idea starting with a very moving reception from the natives to the newcomers from France only this couple are professional actors Thierry Toscan and Alessandra Agosti but everybody else in this movie is as good an actor as anybody you could think of and slowly but surely incidents start building up and greed envy and the worst feelings in human beings start to raise their ugly heads.Excellent development excellent camera work and excellent everything! If you saw Stromboli with Ingrid Bergman Rosellini directing this film has an approximation in its story to that one that is the main characters are driven out of the village because if they remain their lives will become hellish.It's very impressive the way one notices the gradation of moods changing from good to nasty. And when I say nasty I mean NASTY. To me this is a jewel of the Italian cinema but unfortunately a totally noncommercial production. The film is in Italian and the particular dialect Occitane of this place very difficult to understand so much so that when they speak it the subtitles in Italian translate the meaning TO ITALIANS!".

At first the quite old natives are very enthusiastic about the new arrival since the village is almost dead everybody left it long ago to look for better lives in faraway places and they make plans thinking that the cheese maker could be a good addition to the summer months when the tourists will come In winter the weather is very bitter and the snow covers everything. The film develops this idea starting with a very moving reception from the natives to the newcomers from France only this couple are professional actors Thierry Toscan and Alessandra Agosti but everybody else in this movie is as good an actor as anybody you could think of and slowly but surely incidents start building up and greed envy and the worst feelings in human beings start to raise their ugly heads.Excellent development excellent camera work and excellent everything! If you saw Stromboli with Ingrid Bergman Rosellini directing this film has an approximation in its story to that one that is the main characters are driven out of the village because if they remain their lives will become hellish.It's very impressive the way one notices the gradation of moods changing from good to nasty. And when I say nasty I mean NASTY. To me this is a jewel of the Italian cinema but unfortunately a totally noncommercial production. The film is in Italian and the particular dialect Occitane of this place very difficult to understand so much so that when they speak it the subtitles in Italian translate the meaning TO ITALIANS!";

This is a nice study of narcissism metastasized into psychopathology. She is headstrong motivated and rather stupid. She thinks only of herself and would do anything for herself and would do anything to anybody who got in her way. And amazingly she does.Matt Dillon is wasted as the husband in more ways than one. I'm surprised he agreed to do the part. Kidman is mesmerizing and makes us believe in a slightly unbelievable character. We've all known narcissistic little darlings who would kill you for the right shade of eye shadow but to see it acted out so coldly and with such appalling stupidity yet with a psychology so bizarre that it has to be real fairly takes your breath away. It was especially apt that she had him killed so that her pointless little docudrama Teens Speak Out could become newsworthy enough for national exposure. Consicously she doesn't realize this she has no introspection she just acts.Also cute is the way the picture is framed a pseudodocumentary within a pseudodocumentary. Everything is so well orchestrated that when Kidman gets her surprising but entirely appropriate comeuppance at the end we are quite pleased.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:reviewBody "Gus Van Zant's wildly original take on the pursuit of fame at any price is a gruesome black comedy that works flawlessly on every level. Van Zant comes at his story from the viewpoint of a series of narrators who see through media lusting Susan Stone Marretto as she stops at nothing to bask in it's spotlight. The media in turn is more than willing to accommodate.Nicole Kidman as Susan is intimidating beyond the screen as she narrates much of her story into the camera. In addition to her remarkable seductive charm being put to use she also intimidates with a convincing icy coldness. She is the bold and the beautiful and Kidman is perfect to the role.Having bullied her way into a job as a weather forecaster at a small audience cable station Susan never stops shooting higher. She enlists three aimless high schoolers in a plot to kill her husband so as to unburden her to pursue her career. With sex as a tool it is easy to convince the moronically dim Jimmy who masturbates to her late night forecasts to come on board. The three teens Joaquin Phoenix Casey Affleck and Allison Foland are uniformly brilliant particularly Phoenix as the clueless doomed Jimmy. Her husband Larry Matt Dillonit might be said is in the same boat. Dillon along with Ileana Douglas and Wayne Knight fill out the solid supporting cast as narrators and victims of Susan. Buck Henry's biting script shows he has not lost his edge since his Graduate days. Director Van Zant's vision of a fin de siecle cross section of America is brutal and original. From those laboring for the American Dream to the bleak Lidsville existence of the teens Die burns with both nervous energy and tragiccomic farce. Accompanied by an all inclusive period music score Vant Zant's wide angle is both brazen and revealing from gaudy colored suburban drab sterility with hints of incest to tragic siding housing and an auto graveyard landscape that serves as a playground to the teens. Told in flash forward and back Van Zant's pace never lingers for a moment as it rapidly presents an in your face comic and tragic pastiche of dark Americana. Van Zant admirably expresses it with a bold visual flair keeping scenes lean and sharp that over a dozen years later still retain there power and energy. It is a vibrant piece of film making and a 90s classic.".

In addition to her remarkable seductive charm being put to use she also intimidates with a convincing icy coldness. She is the bold and the beautiful and Kidman is perfect to the role.Having bullied her way into a job as a weather forecaster at a small audience cable station Susan never stops shooting higher. She enlists three aimless high schoolers in a plot to kill her husband so as to unburden her to pursue her career. With sex as a tool it is easy to convince the moronically dim Jimmy who masturbates to her late night forecasts to come on board. The three teens Joaquin Phoenix Casey Affleck and Allison Foland are uniformly brilliant particularly Phoenix as the clueless doomed Jimmy. Her husband Larry Matt Dillonit might be said is in the same boat. Dillon along with Ileana Douglas and Wayne Knight fill out the solid supporting cast as narrators and victims of Susan. Buck Henry's biting script shows he has not lost his edge since his Graduate days. Director Van Zant's vision of a fin de siecle cross section of America is brutal and original. From those laboring for the American Dream to the bleak Lidsville existence of the teens Die burns with both nervous energy and tragiccomic farce. Accompanied by an all inclusive period music score Vant Zant's wide angle is both brazen and revealing from gaudy colored suburban drab sterility with hints of incest to tragic siding housing and an auto graveyard landscape that serves as a playground to the teens. Told in flash forward and back Van Zant's pace never lingers for a moment as it rapidly presents an in your face comic and tragic pastiche of dark Americana. Van Zant admirably expresses it with a bold visual flair keeping scenes lean and sharp that over a dozen years later still retain there power and energy. It is a vibrant piece of film making and a 90s classic.";

I don't know if I ever saw Kidman look this pretty which is saying a lot. Matt Dillon costars and is excellent too as are the two young no name actors Joaquin Phoenix and Allison Foland.

Told appropriately in the style of a television documentary it satirizes society's obsession with fame celebrity and television in a way that's sharp and smart but also incredibly funny. The idea to make use of flashbacks and interviews with people who talk directly into the camera is also extremely effective.One of the movie's strongest points is its dialogue which contains lines that make an immediate impact either because of their wit or because of the way in which they succinctly encapsulate the state of mind of a young woman who thinks that You're not anybody in America unless you're on TV. On TV is where we learn about who we really are because what's the point of doing anything worthwhile if nobody's watching? And if people are watching it makes you a better person.Suzanne Stone Nicole Kidman lives in Little Hope New Hampshire and is determined to become a top broadcaster on TV. She's attractive smartly dressed and thoroughly selfabsorbed. Her commitment to making progress in the TV industry is so strong that on her honeymoon she takes time out from being with her new husband to attend an industry convention where she meets and subsequently sleeps with a top network executive. After returning home she gets an entrylevel job at a local cable station where through her persistence she soon becomes the station's evening weather girl and also starts work on a documentary about high school kids called Teens Speak Out.Suzanne's husband Larry Matt Dillon is a thoroughly nice guy who's deeply in love with her and manages his father's Italian restaurant. After being married for nearly a year he thinks they should settle down to running the business together and raising a family. This idea doesn't sit well with Suzanne whose sole focus in life is to make it to the top in television. She decides that she needs to remove any impediments to the progress of her career and so to that end plans to have Larry murdered.Suzanne is very manipulative and becomes increasingly friendly with three of the students who are participating in her documentary so that she can use them to kill Larry. All three students have their problems which she exploits to achieve her ends. She seduces Jimmy Joaquin Phoenix who's not very bright and is supportive to Lydia Mertz Alison Folland who's an overweight misfit and the promise of money wins the support of their friend Russell Hines Casey Affleck. After the murder has been successfully carried out Suzanne's documentary seems to provide the police with some useful clues but actually convicting Suzanne for the crime proves to be impossible.The quality of the acting in this movie is so good that some of the most memorable contributions come from the supporting cast. Matt Dillon is tremendously natural as the guy who can't say no to Suzanne and says she's it. She's the golden girl of my dreams and Illeana Douglas as Larry's cynical sister who's not fooled by Suzanne even for a minute says she can describe her in four letters starting with a c.....cold. Dan Hedaya as Larry's Italian father makes a huge impression. He looks totally sceptical about his son's relationship with Suzanne and through most of the film looks as if he's going to explode with anger at any minute and there's also a superb cameo appearance from George Segal that's not to be missed.Importantly Nicole Kidman is sensational in her role. The way in which she portrays her character's combination of perky attractiveness and utter ruthlessness is tremendously well balanced as is the way in which she conveys how clever she thinks she is whilst also demonstrating convincingly that she's a complete airhead.To Die For is a great piece of filmmaking about a tragic character who after being seduced and corrupted by the media became so obsessed by its superficial values that she ultimately developed into a delusional sociopathic monster. The fact that this kind of story could be made into such a successful comedy really is a great achievement.".

Also stars Dan Hedeya Illeana Douglas Casey Affleck Alison Folland and a most impressive Joaquin Phoenix who gives the flick's other strong turn as the confused unsure but totally love struck teen whom Sue bends to her own will with ease.What a shame the performances from Kidman and Phoenix are the only strong points of the movie. In his attempt to make a hip observant film from Joyce Chopra's original bland drama Murder in New Hampshire Van Sant has completely missed the mark.

	schema:reviewBody "A brief disclaimer  I usually enjoy weird indie films black comedies and social satire.  So my distaste for this flick runs much deeper than a simple matter of personal preference or not getting the point.When I first saw To Die For I almost walked out of the theater.  Upon viewing it years later older and wiser I liked it even less. Ordinarily I would not waste my time panning an old movie but I was appalled to see several slanderous reviewers comparing this piece of pretentious trash favorably to Election and American Beauty which were two of the best films of 1999.  This heresy cannot be left unchallenged.To Die For tries very hard to be a satirical black comedy an art film and a meaningful commentary on the sordid mediaobsessed culture we live in.  It fails badly at all of these goals and rapidly degenerates into selfparody.First of all the movie had no characters... it had caricatures 2dimensional cardboard cutouts.  While certain forms of satire can successfully utilize caricatures to represent certain types of people in society these 2D characters still have to display a certain amount of humanity in order for the viewers to see a reflection of something familiar. Nicole Kidman's character is such a cartoonish and transparent villain that it undercuts the point of the movie and eliminates any chance at humor. I don't see anyone I know reflected in her character... I see Cruella DeVil or Natasha from Bullwinkle without the charm.  Even the trashiest most manipulative TV anchor trying to sleepmurder her way to the top would have to occasionally convince someone that her intentions are pure.  Kidman doesn't.  Reece Witherspoon in Election portrays an exaggerated but recognizable character and the satire succeeds in that film.Apart from Joaquin Phoenix the acting was atrocious.  Kidman gives an uneven wooden performance and appears to be reading from cue cards.  Not a single character other than Phoenix was sympathetic or likeable.  While this may have been exactly the message Van Sant wished to convey about America he goes too far and the satire completely fails.Van Sant wants to be taken seriously as an indie artist so he uses arty editing sudden scene changes and postmodern kitsch.  But all of these efforts are so clicheed and hamhanded that it just comes off as pretentious.  He wants to create an artfilm parody of the American media. Instead he unintentionally creates a SNLalumtype Bmovie parody of art films.To Die For does succeed somewhat at being sleazy but not in any satisfying way.  In the seduction scene the lighting is so bad and Kidman's demeanor so cold and rigid that I felt the horniest teenage male in the world would be turned off in spite of her hot bod and racy lingerie.This isn't even a good bad film which would be fun to gather around with some friends and a case of beer and watch in order to mock it.  It's just plain terrible.  I give it a 2 out of 10 merely out of respect for Joaquin Phoenix.Of course that's just my opinion.  Some folks obviously feel otherwise.".

Ordinarily I would not waste my time panning an old movie but I was appalled to see several slanderous reviewers comparing this piece of pretentious trash favorably to Election and American Beauty which were two of the best films of 1999.  This heresy cannot be left unchallenged.To Die For tries very hard to be a satirical black comedy an art film and a meaningful commentary on the sordid mediaobsessed culture we live in.  It fails badly at all of these goals and rapidly degenerates into selfparody.First of all the movie had no characters... it had caricatures 2dimensional cardboard cutouts.  While certain forms of satire can successfully utilize caricatures to represent certain types of people in society these 2D characters still have to display a certain amount of humanity in order for the viewers to see a reflection of something familiar. Nicole Kidman's character is such a cartoonish and transparent villain that it undercuts the point of the movie and eliminates any chance at humor. I don't see anyone I know reflected in her character... I see Cruella DeVil or Natasha from Bullwinkle without the charm.  Even the trashiest most manipulative TV anchor trying to sleepmurder her way to the top would have to occasionally convince someone that her intentions are pure.  Kidman doesn't.  Reece Witherspoon in Election portrays an exaggerated but recognizable character and the satire succeeds in that film.Apart from Joaquin Phoenix the acting was atrocious.  Kidman gives an uneven wooden performance and appears to be reading from cue cards.  Not a single character other than Phoenix was sympathetic or likeable.  While this may have been exactly the message Van Sant wished to convey about America he goes too far and the satire completely fails.Van Sant wants to be taken seriously as an indie artist so he uses arty editing sudden scene changes and postmodern kitsch.  But all of these efforts are so clicheed and hamhanded that it just comes off as pretentious.  He wants to create an artfilm parody of the American media. Instead he unintentionally creates a SNLalumtype Bmovie parody of art films.To Die For does succeed somewhat at being sleazy but not in any satisfying way.  In the seduction scene the lighting is so bad and Kidman's demeanor so cold and rigid that I felt the horniest teenage male in the world would be turned off in spite of her hot bod and racy lingerie.This isn't even a good bad film which would be fun to gather around with some friends and a case of beer and watch in order to mock it.  It's just plain terrible.  I give it a 2 out of 10 merely out of respect for Joaquin Phoenix.Of course that's just my opinion.  Some folks obviously feel otherwise.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a soso film. It is reasonably entertaining and has some good performances. I am struck by something in reading 20 or so of the 92 comments on this film. None of them have noted one of the more important facts about this story that is that To Die For is loosely based on a reallife drama that unfolded in New England involving a teacher's aide named Pamela Smart who was convicted of having enlisted her teenaged lover and some of his dullwitted school mates to murder her husband. AE's series American Justice ran a very good episode on the subject which they in true AE fashion reair periodically. It is fascinating to see what Buck Henry did with that true story in To Die For. Jimmy Emmett as written by Hery and portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix comes very close to Pamela Smart's reallife boyfriend and I use the term BOYfriend advisedly. The real life teen was obviously smitten by the attractive older woman Pamela Smart is no Nicole Kidman but she was reasonably attractive and more importantly for a teenager willing. The scenes of his testimony during the trial of Pamela Smart are riveting because he was obviously so naive as to have believed that Ms. Smart was in love with him and wanted to be with him. Phoenix captures the mind of that teen confused teen brilliantly. In this case seeing the real life story helped me as a viewer better understand Phoenix's take on the character.On the other hand Henry makes Suzanne a reprehensible character too dimwitted to understand how little she actually knows ultimately she wasn't even smart enough to realize that manipulating lessthanbrilliant teens into an act of murder was not likely to end well. Henry I think took more liberties with the 'real life character here than he did with Jimmy Emmett. The primary attribute Suzanne has in common with Pamela Smart is a willingness to manipulate teen agers to do her bidding. Nonetheless Henry's take on Suzanne is Buck Henry at his leeringly sardonic best.Nicole Kidman is not one of my favorite actors but she does well in this role of Suzanne largely due to Henry's wonderfully caustic take on the ambition to be a television personality. Suzanne's only talent is her looks but the only people she can find who readily agree that has sufficient looks to be a TV news personality are a small group of troubled teen agers. No one else is fooled other than her equally lovestruck husband Matt Dillon.To Die For is not a great film by any means. At times the story slows to a crawl as Henry tries to delve into some depth in the relationships. Of course that is not really what the film is about  it's about Henry's acerbic take on celebrity in America circa the final decade of the 20th century. On that level the movie works. Where it doesn't work so well despite the strong performance of Joaquin Phoenix is in the portrayal of the teenagers. Their motivations are complex more complex than simply having sex with the gorgeous older woman and neither the screenplay nor the direction manage to pull off the merger of the dramatic story of Jimmy Emmett with the dark comedy of Suzanne.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some good things here  most notably the performances of Nicolle Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix  that nevertheless fail to coalesce into a satisfying whole because of the confusion of the central story. Kidman is great as the featherbrained harpy who will stop at nothing to be on television  the absolute narrowness of her worldview to the parameters of what fits onto the TV screen makes her a kind of female counterpart to Jim Carrey's Cable guy. But her singleminded devotion to this aim causes her subsequent actions to make little sense would someone as ambitious as her really stick around in a nowhere New England town humorously named Little Hope rather than set out for the big time of New York or Los Angeles? Such a transplant would have given the movie a kick since it would have set Suzanne's fundamental cluelessness against the reality of the television industry and how it actually works to perhaps more humorous results than are displayed here.But even if you can buy Suzanne remaining in her isolated little hamlet and it must be said that the setting does allow for some subtler more understated humor than the scenario drawn above would have does it make any sense whatsoever for her to get involved with much less marry the Matt Dillon character? If we're really supposed to buy her as someone who thinks about nothing but television and making it in that medium then what could she possibly see in Dillon who is barely even familiar with TV? Any explanation would probably be lame but what's lamer is the fact that the filmmakers don't even try to supply one! This leaves you with the sick feeling that it only happens in order to get the plot moving  the worst possible reason for ANYTHING to happen!This fundamental flaw in plot logic really sinks the movie before it even has time to get going. That's a shame because there are SO MANY good things here Kidman's performance is wonderfully perky and shallow in all the right ways and the candycolored outfits that have been designed for her are a scream just in themselves. The narrative style is inventive being told in flashback as a series of interviews  Hard Copy style or even Oprah style  with the main participants which in itself forms a metacritique upon television and its reconstruction of the world although curiously the film keeps dropping in and out of this style and so waters down its effect. Finally Phoenix is at once both hilarious and heartbreaking in his portrayal of a trailer park teenager so besotted with Kidman and the sophistication she supposedly represents the joke's on him of course that he'd literally do anything for her which is exactly his undoing. Watching him I kept thinking of Dustin Hoffman's groundbreaking performance in The Graduate and how it operated on the twin levels of satire and true sympathy all at once. Phoenix in my opinion hits the same bullseye.Other enjoyable performances come from Ileana Douglas as Dillon's sister wonderfully nasty and sarcastic when discussing Kidman and then surprisingly touching and vulnerable when you're least expecting it and Wayne Knight as the head of the cable station where Suzanne comes to work. If you know Knight only as Newman on TV's Seinfeld and so believe him only capable of wild overacting his performance here is a treat his baffled and understated responses to Suzanne's dippy ideas and shenanigans are some of the funniest things in the picture.But in the end it all comes to nothing. The good things in this movie just can't salvage the fact that the central story has not been worked out with enough rigor. The film spins its wheels beautifully but it simply has nowhere to go.".

Nicole Kidman makes me nervous as a viewer i'm always conscious of the fact that she's acting. Painfully so. The artificiality of her performance might be fine for black comedy but in practical story terms I just don't see why anybody would be fooled by her. She's clearly unbalanced from the getgo. What works about this is that there's a feeling of an inescapable fate  people marry the wrong person all the time so that was the one interesting thing about it that a person can actually be so blind to the fact that a person is wrong when we know she turns out being very wrong but we can't stop him from marrying her.The talking to the camera was so gimmicky it made me sick. As was the use of rock music in the film to try and convince us Nicole is really some dark superhero.15.".

Or don't see it. A lot of people are unhappy with this flick and I believe I understand why.One of the reasons this movie has been getting bad reviews is that it is being advertised as a romantic comedy and it isn't one. You have Sandra Bullock who has been in some very good romcoms and two goodlooking guys including Thomas Haden Church who is always willing to mock his immobile good looks and deadpan delivery the advertising campaign looks like a romantic comedy. What else can it be? Answer it's a pure clown comedy with a lead who starts out unlikeable but goes on an inadvertent voyage of selfdiscovery. Its antecedents are not the romcoms you grew up on but classic flat out farces like Keaton's THE NAVIGATOR and Harold Lloyd's WHY WORRY? in which we start out disliking the hero heartily. In these movies we wait for the comic to get kicked in the pants because we don't like him..... but by the end of the movie he has grown in wisdom and selfreliance and we wish him well. Or in this movie her. It's a difficult balancing act and some people think Miss Bullock has fallen off the wire. Since she starts out as an unbearably smart motormouth to whom people are an utter mystery who winds up stalking Bradley Cooper it's easy to write her off as insane and give up.But I didn't and it took me about half the movie to realize what the film makers were doing. It's not something done often since movies learned to speak and among female leads I can only think of Katherine Hepburn in BRINGING UP BABY and of course Goldie Hawn's movies in which her characters break out of their molds and walk away as good people although her most financially successful outing was probably PRIVATE BENJAMIN she did something even more extreme than the transformation that Miss Bullock undergoes here in OVERBOARD. One of the problems that people may have with this movie is that this is so rarely done and Miss Bullock has the courage needed to bring off a comedy she isn't afraid to look stupid or foolish or dress in outfits that don't suit her or fall into a hole in the ground. So many actors are.Miss Bullock doesn't change much here. She does become more selfaware as she talks endlessly about crossword puzzles cicadas hurricanes in Galveston and so on. The people she picks up on her voyage of self discovery are nerdy not too bright but quite willing to put up with her peculiarities because she will do as much for them meanwhile Steve Hartman and Angus whom she pursues make up a news team and are busy worrying about how to get air time usually by inserting themselves into news events as reporters making themselves of interest when they have nothing much to offer. The actors do a good job even when the roles are not well written or some key piece of celluloid seems to have wound up on the cutting room floor.This is by no means a great movie but it does have enough grace notes scattered throughout to have kept up my interest. If you sat down to watch it I hope you will agree. If you read this despite the spoiler warning perhaps you will give it a chance. I don't guarantee you will not be disappointed Miss Bullock's character may strain your patience beyond recovery before the story turns around but then again you may have a very good time as did I.".

She struggles to be normal but meanwhile finds that what's important is to be herself.It's been really good acted especially Bullock and Thomas Haden Church has a good rhythm and a clever script.It's the kind of movie you will enjoy... when you enjoy what you see and not what you're supposed to see.".

I also liked the characters. Sandra Bullock is easily one of the best actresses today even though she remains underrated. As annoying as her character Mary might be there is something likable about her an innocence and intelligence that made it impossible for me to dislike her. What Bullock excellently demonstrates is that Mary is a very brainy person but she is socially handicapped and consequently people don't give themselves the opportunity to see a lovable kind and caring side of her personality. Bullock is further brilliantly supported by Bradley Cooper Ken Jeong Katey Mixon and Thomas Haden Church this guy should be in more movies. 'All About Steve' is all about laughing. There were so many moments that had me laughing hysterically that I would suggest that one ought to just enjoy the film without expecting too much of anything else.".

Sandra does a fine job of portraying her character realistically as much realism as you can expect in a comedysatire. This is what they used to call screwball comedies back in the blackandwhite film era except that the male actor always had talent. I haven't seen any evidence yet that Bradley Cooper gets work for any reason except being cute no problem talent will not be required from him for another ten to fifteen years. Thomas Hayden Church as usual nails the selfabsorbed pompous airhead character they always have him play. That's OK if you're good at only one thing and can make a career of it at least he's a step ahead of Bradley. My main disappointment was that the applehead sculpture website they mention for one character doesn't exist. You type in the domain name and it takes you to the movie website. I wanted appleheads doggonnit! Oh and they didn't put Katie Mixon to nearly enough use what a waste of......TALENT! This one is a keeper on my Sandra Bullock DVD shelf.".

Sandra Bullock took on a character that was innocent in her social stupidity yet made her almost believable in her irritating behavior. I say almost because she is still quite beautiful and likable. But she is no Johnny Depp yet when it comes to character acting.We found the movie funny and quirky. I felt that they had a good ensemble cast even though Sandra Bullock was the center of the story. I don't believe it will ever be hugely popular though. It had the same unusual character as Will Ferrall and Emma Thompson in Stranger Than Fiction although no where as sophisticated as that little masterpiece.If you like quirky comedy this is a good movie to watch.".

Naturally her parents want Mary to experience love marriage and children so they keep trying to get her out of the house. Setting her up with the son of close friends Mary reluctantly agrees to go out with Steve Bradley Cooper. But oh joy! Steve is a looker and has an intriguing job as the cameraman for a cable news reporter Hartman Thomas Haden Church. Mary likes likes likes what she sees. But since the puzzlewriter won't stop talking and makes heavy romantic advances Steve gets spooked only minutes into their first date and he bolts citing his need to get to a new work assignment. But Mary is dizzy in love. She bumbles her next crossword duties gets fired and suddenly decides to follow Steve to his current location and the next one too. Steve is horrified and tries to get rid of her but Hartman tells Mary privately that Steve is secretly happy she is there and that she should not get discouraged in her pursuit of love. Its a puzzlement! Will Mary get her heart's desire? In the world of romantic comedies this one is an odd duck. It is interesting and has many good elements but doesn't achieve overall success. However its weaknesses do not include the cast for Bullock Cooper and especially Haden Church are great. All of the supporting cast members are very fine too. In fact its the actors' skills that elevate the film beyond its script and tentative direction. Yes it tries to make some good statements about individuality media hype and the like. But it never totally succeeds in getting its points across with aplomb. On a lesser note the costumes and sets are quite nice indeed. In short if you love Bullock Cooper Haden Church or quirky movies you might give this one a whirl. Sometimes an interesting failure is more fun than a slick but pointless flick.".

This was a satire on Everything from the news industry to the quirky girl to the people who would light a candle for any cause. There are real people out there who act as goofy as these characters. I have seen them but maybe not all in one place. Then every character was played to the Extreme! There was constant action and I didn't care if it jumped around a lot  that's what made it funny. This proves that a movie doesn't need a predictable plot sequence to be entertaining. In the end it all came together. Sandra Bullock is unbeatable in this part  I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off. The supporting cast was equally funny  there was not one who stood out more than the others. Sometimes I laughed so hard til I cried and we replayed several parts over and over. For example The woman telling of her birth defect and Mary's face when the truck driver put her in a quiet time. The irony is that she was so serious about her words and her work but so goofy in other respects. This is a good bit of nonsensical comedy.".

How wrong I was! The movie goes wrong the second these two meet for their blind date and never looks back. The main reason I think I had such a disconnect with this movie is because the characters do not act like any living person on this planet. Furthermore Sandra Bullock does not have a clear role to play she's vacillates between being sophisticated and clueless at all times when it's convenient for the plot. I don't know if I was supposed to sympathize with her or not but the eventual effect was annoyance! It's not a good sign when you're hoping that they just leave her at the bottom of that well. Bradley Cooper basically just smiles throughout the movie.The movie also can't decide what genre it wants to belong to. It tries to be a comedy a drama of self discovery a satire of cable news and a natural disaster movie whether it be tornado or abandoned well and fails at all attempts. Let it be said that the tornado looks good and that's about the best thing I can say about this movie.I think I laughed twice during the film but I can't remember if it was related to what was on screen or my on disbelief that I was in this theater. Sadly I would be willing to bet that a conversation with a real crossword puzzle designer for ninety minutes would be more fun than sitting through this mess!".

My wife is a psychologist who works with children on the autism spectrum a lot and found Bullock's portrayal to be spoton of a woman with what used to be called Asperger Syndrome high functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder with normal intelligence and language. Her character is off the wall and at times annoying to those around her yet at the same time endearing. And in the end unlike a conventional romcom the point is not whether or not she gets the object of her affection but whether she finds her people  men and women who appreciate her for who she is and help her come to love herself for who she is. The fact that Steve doesn't fall for her in the end but comes to respect and admire her anyway makes this a stronger movie. Bradley Cooper does a good job as usual with what could have been a throwaway role portraying the desperation of a hunted man with a manic wildeyed incredulity that he's in this situation. Thomas Hayden Church is hilarious as the gonzojournalism news reporter happy to egg Bullock's character's obsession along to create a story and for the pure enjoyment of watching Cooper's character squirm. I predict over time this will become a cult classic.".

Will Shortz the creator of the New York Times crossword puzzles said that we all have an inherent need to fill empty spaces Mary realizes towards the end of the movie that the whole obsession with Steve is driven by this need to fill a void in her life that she like many of us refused to recognize. We fill those holes in our otherwise happy lives with different things like work exercising eating and even a passionate albeit baseless belief of a strong romantic connection with someone. Eventually Mary realized that this internal void need not be filled with the thought of one great love like many of the rom com movies try to feed us but rather by the many people we meet the old and new friendships we make and the many stumbles we'll have as we journey through life.".

The Bachelor is the sort of movie that seems about eight years old as soon as it comes out on TV.  The special effects involving various men running with horses look about this old.Basically the film revolves around the idea of bachelors as stallions powerful wild and free the idea of true love and functions  as a frame work for cute romantic cliches about true love and what not.  Basically the best part that lasts more than thirty seconds is the proposal with Buckley.  This is not worth watching the movie for.The only non paid for reference read non advertisement to this movie that I have seen is something about Mariah Carey from singing to acting but this is the sort of acting that a fan would not want spread around.  Oh well so much for long term artistic merit or historical value of any kind.What interests me most about this movie is what bystanders thought when they saw the scenes with hundreds of wedding dress clad bride hopefuls storming the streets running up and down the same hill over and over again until they got the perfect take and generally walking around the city. The wedding dress scenes are very impressive and alone are almost worth watching the movie previews for.  It is kind of sad that some sort of candid camera clip of bystanders staring at a bunch of actresses in wedding gowns would probably be more exciting than the movie but thats the way it is with The Bachelor.I didnt think that this movie was worth my time but some people just love happy little romantic comedies.  I realize that I am not in this group and consider this to be the worst movie that I have paid to see this year.  Try as I might I will never get back my 5 dollars and the 90 minutes of my life spent on this movie.  If you do watch this do something else preferably something distracting at the same time.

It's a movie that almost seems to promise hilarity yet strangely the movie isn't that funny. In fact it's not that interesting either though certainly not unwatchable. Yet for some reason even though this movie contains two warm likable charismatic leads the movie never picks up steam.I think there were a few things that I did not like here one being the playing out of a very funny premise. But the movie even though it's not that long gets rather irritating. The whole thing centers on O'Donnell proposing to various women and while it was fun at first none of the women are in their scenes long enough to make a strong comedic impression and Zelwegger herself while coming across as charming and sweet as always is somewhat underused. Her main point seems to be moaning about her problems with Jimmy. In the meantime the viewer can't make up their mind whether Jimmy is a nice guy or a jerk mainly because he keeps switching back and forth and we never get to see him one aspect of his personality for to long.The movie becomes a bit tedious as well as Jimmy races around in search of new ex girlfriends to propose to so he can get his inheritance. It should be laugh out loud funny but isn't. I was moderately interested in how it turned out but also wanted it to end. It was a given that these two would wind up together anyway.The movie didn't seem to contain enough truly hilarious material and with a premise such as this it should have because this is a great situation on which to build a romantic comedy. I thought there would be unforgettable one liners and I'd be falling out of my seat....did not happen at all. However with this cast particularly Zelwegger I'd never call it bad just strongly lacking in some areas particularly the comedic.And then we come to the famous scene with the hundredsor thousands? of Brides chasing Jimmy. Now if any scene had the potential to be UTTERLY HILARIOUS it was that one. But it doesn't happen. The brides aren't funny their annoying and by that time one just wants them to stop chasing the groom so he can marry Renee Zelwegger and the movie can end. It's another scene that should be hysterical but just fell flat.In closing this is watchable but a bit disappointing and not very funny though the end is very romantic and big fans of Zelwegger may want to check it out that was my main reason for doing so. My rating is 5 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE BACHELOR 1999  Starring Chris O'Donnell Rene Zellweger James Cromwell Hal Holbrook and Brooke Shields Directors Buster Keaton and Gary Sinyor   Running time 101 minutes   Rated PG13 for language and some sexrelated dialogueBy Blake FrenchNew Line Cinema appears to be on a losing streak this year with releasing flops and encountering narrow critical success with their productions. From Drop Dead Gorgeous to Detroit Rock City to Body Shots and now The Bachelor. This movie is a romantic comedy that contains such a flat feeling and predictable plot it is arguably the worst film released by this production company all year.  The Bachelor accommodates a story centering on undeveloped characters and the one dimensional situations they are placed into. The male romantic lead here is played Chris O'Donnell and his name is Jimmie Shannon who is supposedly in love with the usually dependable Rene Zellweger where here is Anne. Jimmie and Anne are developed within a brief three minute opening scene where one meets the other at a coffee house when they exchange about ten words with each other. Their conversation is of pointless proportions and has no clue of preparing any romantic chemistry or witty dialogue for us. Thus there is no believable quality between Anne and Jimmie and this is just the opening sequence. How can a romance be effective if we don't buy the couple as a couple from the first scene? We couldn't care less about the characters so far in the film mainly because we lack knowledge concerning them. But soon afterward Jimmie proposes to Anne at a fancy restaurant where for some reason she is offended at his verbal presentation. You see the film is so hopeless for romantic tension it uses the Anne character as a stubborn unhappy brat in attempt to raise it. The film requires a delay in the engagement due to an upcoming gimmick. Now we have Anne angry at Jimmie hence taking a trip to some place far away in the very near futurebusiness matters. These events are present is to increase what little dramatic tension there. It also requires Jimmie to clean up his act before Anne leaves. Then one of his old relatives die whose will  leaves Jimmie over one hundred million dollars if his current life applies toward his requirements basically he has to be married within a day. The conflict is introduced in the beginning of the second act instead of at the start the picture. Not that it really matters where the problem is brought to our attention because we don't care about the outcome of any relationship here. The rest of the film has Jimmie running from exgirlfriend to exgirlfriend desperately proposing to each so he can receive the cash promised. After a brief appearance by a popular pop singer to an almost successful wed to a bitchy character played by Brooke Shields Jimmie only finds himself deeper in love with the girl in his heart Anne.I will not announce if Anne and Jimmie find true love in each other. Nor will I say if Jimmie inherits the millions left to him. The only thing we know by the trailers and posters is that somehow Jimmie will be trailed by hundreds of angry bridetobe's down the streets of his home town. This scene is highly anticipated and energetic but never really funny. The way it is carried out wreaks of hilarity but lacks slapstick quality and believe it or not it doesn't provoke any laughs.  The supporting roles are overacted and exaggerated but the main characters are greatly underplayed. The two romantic leads are boring shallow witless puppets of the plot. That is most certainly the reason why I found myself enjoying the side characters. Brooke Shields contributes an effective performance with a small side character. And James Cromwell as a kindhearted priest is easily the most interesting character in the moviethe only thing is he utters but ten lines throughout the movie.The performances from Chris O'Donnell and the Rene Zellweger come off as dreadfully dual unimaginative and withered. O'Donnell doesn't bring any charm to his otherwise likable character and ends up performing with conventional utterly undertaken style. And Zellweger who was so good in One True Thing has nothing to do here beyond following the commands of the plot. What a colossal disappointment. Another thing absent in The Bachelor is laughs which are no where to be found. The way the film is portrayed is not funny at all mainly because after the gimmick is introduced we receive more and more of the same unfunny marital. This is due to the severe lack of concern for the characters. One of the viewers I screened the production with literally fell asleep during this movie. She says that this is because it is boring. I say it is because we care so little and know so little about the characters we feel tired and slumberous. Conclusion Statement Half way through The Bachelor I still did not know the character's names. And personally I never did care enough to learn them.  Brought to you by New Line Cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anytime you come across a comedy that's well written superbly acted and delivered and really funny to boot it's a treat.  Unfortunately The Bachelor' directed by Gary Sinyor is not one of them.  Beginning with the voiceover narration of star Chris O'Donnell which draws an inane analogy between young single American males and wild mustangs and on through the rest of the contrivances of the lame story right to the end this movie is a disaster.  Right out of the gate it breaks the first rule of successful comedy  Play it straight and they will laugh.  O'Donnell reads the narrative in a lilting singsong manner that plays down to the audience it implies This is funny you can laugh now.'  Never mind that it isn't funny that there's nothing at all in what he's saying that makes you want to laugh.  The intent I believe with this movie was to make a romantic comedy what they ended up with is the most unromantic drivel you can possibly imagine.  When Jimmie Shannon O'Donnell asks his girlfriend of three years Anne Renee Zellweger to marry him she turns him down because his proposal is so crass the worst ever made.  Ironically it comes in one of the worst scenes possibly ever filmed.  Watching it takes you out of the story and almost makes you embarrassed for the actors.  The next day Jimmie's grandfather Peter Ustinov dies and leaves him over one hundred million dollars provided he is married by 605 p.m. the time he was born on his thirtieth birthday which happens to be in Twentyseven hours and change.'  Since the girl he loves has given him the gate and rightfully so because this guy is a real jerk he spends the rest of the movie contacting old girlfriends trying to find one who is willing to marry him.  And for the audience it makes for nothing more than one long make that LONG endurance test. O'Donnell brings nothing to the character of Jimmie he is merely boring and tiresome.  Talk about a less than sympathetic character.  Renee Zellweger whose career has been on a roll since Jerry MaGuire' goes into a tailspin here.  She does her best with what she has to work with but it's not enough.  That there's no chemistry between Anne and Jimmie is not her fault O'Donnell is just so unappealing in this role he couldn't make sparks with a flint.  The talented supporting cast which includes Hal Holbrook O'Dell Ed Asner Gluckman James Cromwell Priest Artie Lange Marco and Marley Shelton Natalie is wasted here as well.  Mariah Carey makes a brief inauspicious appearance as one of Jimmie's former girlfriends Ilana in a scene better for all concerned had it wound up on the cutting room floor.  The single high point if you can call it that amid all of this dreck is the scene in which Brooke Shields turns in a notable performance as Buckley another of Jimmie's girlfriends.  She plays her with an aloofness that actually makes her endearing and to find that in the midst of this film is a minor triumph.  To put it as succinctly as possible this is a bad movie.  There's not a laugh to be had and even the attempted slapstick and sight gags fall short which proves that nothing can save a project that begins with a screenplay as acerbic and obtuse as this one.  Personally I refuse to walk out on even the worst movies or to even turn off a video without sticking it out to the bitter end it's like a code I live by.  With this film though I must confess I honestly came as close as I ever have to breaking my own rule.  I rate this one 210.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Bachelor is a pretty good light romantic comedy.  Brook Shields does indeed have the best scene in the whole flick.  It's well described below and is wonderfully funny.  Rene Zellweger is both very good and very charming as is Chris O'Donnell.   It's not the sort of movie that will stay with you for much but its pretty good fun while it's going on.There's one thing I have to say though and the main reason I'm bothering with a comment to this flick.  Those that claim this movie is unrealistic and misogynist because of it's depiction of O'Donnell's former girlfriends and the huge number of women desperate for 100 million dollars are infected with a serious case of delusional feminist PC propaganda.  I can guarantee you that if an ad turned into a front page article with a picture guaranteeing sharing in a 100 million fortune for marrying a guy who looks like Chris O'Donnell the next day in a big American city and clarifying that he was deadline desperate due to the date of his grandfather's death and the will provisions so that many would feel they had a chance and he wasn't necessarily an impossible loser there would indeed be hordes of women lining up to do it.  Many wouldn't of course.  But there'd be legions willing to take their chances.  One of the main things limiting the numbers in fact would be self selection. The clich that women especially after their early 20's tend to be attracted to money or its prospect fame and or success while men tend to be attracted to beauty has more than a little truth to it.  Of course there also has to be personal chemistry in the ordinary course but with 100 million on the table a great many women would take their chances.  So the crowd scenes are indeed plausible if so many managing the wedding dresses on a few hours notice isn't.What's most unrealistic is the PC balancing rejection this centimillionaire gets from all but one of his former girl friends.  That of course is what takes up the bulk of the movie.  That is what is impossible to believe in the real world.  In other words The Bachelor actually leans over backwards to pretend that a far higher proportion of women wouldn't be swayed by the 100 million than is realistic.   But just imagine how a more accurate balance would be criticized by the American media not to mention academic pundits of the moment.  There are endless dismissive allusions to men being unduly or primarily interested in women's looks in today's American films  and that that is terrible.  Why  well because women tend to have different priorities and women must be right not only for themselves but for men as well of course..  That sort of commentary with some basis in truth if not in how it is characterized often clearly intended as a put down of males is perfectly fine under the reigning Hollywood ideology.   Whereas highlighting women's special attraction often enough to men with power of various sorts  money fame politics or sometimes physical power  is dangerous ground indeed.  Gee I wonder why that is.".

	schema:headline " Madcap and entertaining romantic comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "I found this to be a madcap and highly entertaining romantic comedy.  This is a remake of the 1925 Buster Keaton classic Seven Chances' and this story has been trotted out a number of times since in various forms so the material is far from fresh.  Jimmie Shannon Chris O'Donnell is a confirmed bachelor who finds himself in love with Anne Rene Zellweger.  As his friends begin dropping like flies to the marriage bug Jimmie realizes that his time too has come.  So he proposes to Anne but he botches it making it so unromantic that despite desperately wanting to accept she runs from the room.  When his grandfather dies he discovers that he is the sole heir to a vast fortune of 100 million but to get it he needs to get married by 605 PM on his birthday which as it happens is the following day.  With his one true love gone he must marry someone so he begins a litany of successive proposals to all his old girlfriends.The story is utterly predictable and overly zany. It is comedy in its simplest and most unsophisticated form.  Slapstick if done well can be very funny and this was done well.  There were numerous belly laughs in this film from the many sight gags and absurd situations that develop.  The romance between Jimmie and Anne was also charming.The direction by Gary Sinyor was nothing special from a visual standpoint but I felt he handled the setup of the sight gags well and did a good job of orchestrating the movement of the thousand or so brides in the chase scene worthy of any Keystone Kops skit.  The special effects on the Mustang scenes were pretty weak though.Chris O'Donnell was very good in his role as Jimmie.  His comedic timing was mostly effective and he succeeded in looking totally hapless in his various scenes with erstwhile girlfriends.  I thought his chemistry with Zellweger was excellent and sincere especially at the end.Rene Zellweger was a good choice for this role.  Though she is no goddess she has a very natural sweet and wholesome attractiveness very real and vulnerable.  She really made the romantic part of the story singlehandedly with her misty eyed looks and genuine longing for Jimmie.I rated this film an 810.  I enjoy this kind of silly romantic farce but it is not for everyone.  It requires an ability to laugh at absurd pratfall humor.  If you are in the mood for a good light date movie this might be a good choice.  But if you don't like slapstick you will probably want to steer clear.".

Life with girlfriend Anne is perfect because she doesn't seem to have any desire to take that extra step either.  The day that she does start to think about 'the future' things take a nasty turn. O'Donnell as Jimmy struggles through a proposal simply because his peers tell him he must.  Anne turns him down of course because his intentions are not honorable.  The plot thickens when Jimmy's ornery grandfather dies and leaves a 100 million dollar fortune to Jimmy the only surviving relative.  The catch is that our hero can only collect the money if he is married by his 30th birthday which just happens to be in one day.  A daring move one of the lawyers utters something about this being 'Brewster's Millions.'  A clever line obviously written by someone brave enough to admit that this plot is a total rip off.With the aid of his best friend a few lawyers and a stoic priest played by James Cromwell he sets about trying to win the heart of Anne.  When that doesn't succeed Jimmy goes through the list of old girlfriends most of whom are personality challenged and some of whom do not remember him fondly.  Anyone with a weak heart might melt at the image of O'Donnell running through the streets of San Francisco with a bouquet of flowers others would probably be wise just to pass.  O'Donnell and Zellweger play well in this film but like most cardboard comedies there isn't much for the actors to do.One might spot an attempt a some black humor in the same vein as better films like Heathers and Election but it failures to even come close to those.  The Bachelor presents an opening thesis using wild mustangs to describe men.  As each of his friends gets hitched we see them running along side a herd of these horses a lasso about to snag them.

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1999 The Bachelor is a romcom starring Chris O'Donnell as a commitmentphobic bachelor in San Francisco. When his grandfather dies he stands to inherit 100 million but with the stipulation that he must be married by the next evening amongst other conditions. Unfortunately the woman he loves Anne is nowhere to be found Rene Zellweger so his best friend Artie Lange puts an ad in the paper which attracts a thousand wannabe brides literally chasing the bachelor and his fortune. Marley Shelton plays Anne's sister while Edward Asner and Hal Holbrook have side roles.The movie has a great cast and a fun vibe. O'Donnell and Zellweger are appealing protagonists but I was bored by most of the first 45 minutes. Thankfully the story perks up when the bachelor seeks out several past girlfriends and unconvincingly proposes. This sequence features entertaining cameos by the likes of Jennifer Esposito Mariah Carey Brooke Shields Sarah Silverman Stacy Edwards and Katharine Towne. Unfortunately the filmmakers failed to take advantage of this wealth of feminine resources with the exception of the striking Esposito and Shields the latter of whom is delightful as a golddigging biyatch. The rest are underutilized. Nevertheless Katharine Towne shines in her small role.The most memorable sequence of course is the dude being chased through the streets of San Francisco by a thousand brides but this only comprises about a dozen minutes of the movie. Those who favor romcoms might like this one better than I did. For me it's not bad but it's not good either although there are some amusing moments. The plot is creative but the script needed tweaked to flesh out its potential.The film runs 101 minutes and was shot in San Francisco downtown L.A. and USC and Cook Ranch Galisteo New Mexico.GRADE C".

If you ever wonder how Bugs would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on you should watch this cartoon. Director Bob McKimson offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour.

In a brilliant Disney parody he hollers Pinocchio down the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. There are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'Laugh Clown Laugh' which as a child I used to impersonate regularly! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name. I've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but 'Acrobatty Bunny' breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst McKimson's best.".

While it starts off a little rocky with some disappointingly blocky animation the cartoon gets better and better and the animation does as well so by halfway through it is much more colourful and solid. The music throughout is absolutely great I loved the dialogue and the sight gags were both hilarious and aweinspiring. What I also loved about Acrobatty Bunny was how quickly it went it didn't feel rushed but it skipped along with consummate ease. As for Bugs I had no problem with his performance whatsoever he's still the funny arrogant and charming rabbit I fell in love with when I was six years old. Mel Blanc does a stellar job with the vocals so overall I don't think other than the rocky start that you will be disappointed. 910 Bethany Cox".

What I also loved about Acrobatty Bunny was how quickly it went it didn't feel rushed but it skipped along with consummate ease. As for Bugs I had no problem with his performance whatsoever he's still the funny arrogant and charming rabbit I fell in love with when I was six years old. Mel Blanc does a stellar job with the vocals so overall I don't think other than the rocky start that you will be disappointed. 910 Bethany Cox";

Filled with blood gore and sound clips from the Italian ProgRock band Goblin this movie is a must see for any survival horror film fans. This one was also heavily influenced by the films of Ruggero Deodato Umberto Lenzi and Tobe Hopper. Not your ordinary kungfu film!Several people have disappeared on a remote island near Hong Kong. The people of this island are all insane and crave the taste of human flesh. They feed on unsuspecting visitors and escaping fugitives. One day a government agent named 999 Norman Tsui is in the area looking for a long time federal fugitive named Rolex Melvin Wong. After being robbed by a fellow traveler and left to die in a trap Agent 999 comes across the mad residents of the island's city. No one wants to cooperate. So after beating up a few locals the chief of police Eddy Ko grants him an audience and points him in the direction of a nearby slaughterhouse. Foolishly he heads off to the house and nearly winds up on the residents' plate.Despite all of the evidence presented to him and meeting the fugitive Rolex he refuses to believe that the islanders are cannibals. The chief is fed up with Agent 999's snooping and decides to get rid of him. The runaway thief is also hiding out in town and he witnesses' first hand the barbaric cannibalism and tries to warn the police chief. He winds up being chased by the police who are in cahoots with the cannibals. Desperate to escape the pot the thief uses the chimney technique to flee the hungry cops. He even uses a cat as a weapon. But all to no avail the thief is captured and thrown in a cell waiting to be eaten.Rolex is sick of the cannibals and tries to help Agent 999. The chief suspect's Rolex's treachery and kills him dead. Still in denial Agent 999 skins off Rolex's tattoo and leaves the village. He doesn't get far and is captured. In despair and praying for help from anyone Agent 999 is about to be sliced and diced before the thief who escaped earlier thanks to a friendly local frees Agent 999 and helps the kid and the agent kill the captors and look for the kid's sister. Agent 999 has no luck because he's captured again. The chief is taking no chances and wants to slice him up in public. Before he can the thief and the kid fight off the cannibals using a couple of pairs of roller skates and a case of firecrackers.The desperate trio rescue the girl and leave for the beach. They find a hidden raft and take it to safety. A crazed lone cannibal jumps on the raft and attacks the three dudes. Agent 999 goes psycho and kills the man with his bare hands. Saitified the agent swims out the rescue the thief and the kid. When they return they scream in horror as the sister has ripped the dead man's heart out and holds it out for all to see. She's very hungry.A pretty down beat ending for a crazy movie. This was made during Tsui Hark's dark period. He made three depressing films BUTTERFLY MURDERS WE'RE GOING TO EAT YOU and the very rare DONT PLAY WITH FIRE. Filled with a lot of gore toilet humor and some wild stunts and fight scenes.Highly recommended.".

It's a very strange hybrid of kungfu action cannibal horror and comedy  with some really off the wall scenes and some decent gore.This one has a special government agent known as agent 999 who goes to a remote island village to track down and arrest a notorious thief. Turns out the villagers are all cannibals who dine on unsuspecting visitors. Gore and hilarity ensue early on as our hero has numerous misadventures with the local townspeople which include various freaks crazed maskwearing butchers a giant transvestite and the towns chief  a greedy dick who hordes all the meat for himself and his security team leaving almost nothing for the townspeople to live on.This could have been a really dark film considering the subject matter but WE'RE GOING TO EAT YOU is intentionally handled as a comedy with all sorts of goofiness to lighten the film  including the insatiable transvestite that doesn't take no for an answer and a hilarious kungfu segment involving rollerskates and firecrackers. Many crossgenre films don't really work  but WE'RE GOING TO EAT YOU pulls it off. A great Sunday afternoon diversion  especially with a few drinks in ya...810".

Harry finds himself on the wrong end of some amorous advances by a huge ugly woman seriously she's at least a foot taller than anybody else in the film with syphilis. 999 is attacked by whooping cannibal butchers wearing odd green masks.Anyhow the film follows a fairly logical progression up until the climactic battle between 999 and the Chief of police the dictatorial ruler of the village who refuses to give out fair shares of meat.  As another reviewer has mentioned here there is quiet a bit of communist thought in this movie critcising its abuses and SPOILERshowing it going off the best when the system is returned to the peopleSPOILER and some philosophic though If you don't eat people they'll eat you is symbolic but you can also just enjoy it.  This is a wonderful black comedy with a lot of physical comedy routines mixed in with the martial arts as well as some verbal jokes.  This is a very enjoyable experience if you can see it.  If you enjoyed Dead Alive Story of Ricky or Seventh Curse and don't mind trying to make out the smallest subtitles ever this movie is for you.This is the second movie that the legendary Tsui Hark directed.  You may remember his work from the Zu movies A Chinese Ghost Story Once Upon a Time in China and Time and Tide.  There's also Norman Choi AKA Norman Tsui SiuKeung appearing as 999 two years before his role as Hashimoto in the monumental Duel to the Death.  Eddy Ko who was the Chief in this movie was also in Duel to the Death as Kenji Rumble in the Bronx and Lethal Weapon 4 ! as Hong.  This is interesting to see where some of the people ended up. It seems this was the only movie half of the castcrew was in but the other half went on to great things.  If you're just a completist this is certainly a musthave curiosity.  If you just want some fun with the occaisonal gore this should also be up your alley.I just wish I knew who did choreography.  When watching this movie with friends they were slackjawed though it often wasn't amazing by comparison to other films I've seen.  Not to say it was badno the martial arts were at the very least on the level and probably on the upside though wouldn't distinguish this film from any other myriad kungfu flicks out there on its own unless you count the comedy in the fights.  If you're a conneseur it won't be excellent but it'll be competent.  If you're not used to the intricacies of martial art movie fights you should be impressed.Now to stop ranting.  You shall purchase this now!".

	schema:reviewBody "With a crazy overthetop title like We're Going to Eat You! you should already know not to expect a cannibal film with nailbiting suspense andor disturbing shock sequences but more of a deranged black comedy with absurd situations and a lightheaded ambiance. It all depends on your personal sense of humor of course but I thought this was a truly relaxing and imaginative Hong Kong cult film! There's not much of a storyline but the gazillion KungFu fighting sequences are masterfully choreographed and indescribably spectacular. On more than one occasion during these grotesque fights I wondered how the hell it was possible for certain people to be so ingeniously pliant! The story's hero is Special Agent 999 who in his quest to arrest the wanted criminal Rolex I guess he steals watches travels to an island inhabited by a strange community of cannibalistic weirdos. Agent 999 teams up with an eccentric loner and the only vegetarian girl in town to battle his way off the island again. The script limits itself to showing how 999  C get captured by the cannibals and how they subsequently fight their way out of the bubbling cauldrons again so you really shouldn't consider watching this HKsplatter flick for its intelligent dialogs or slowly oozing suspense. The fights are funny and creative with the rollerskating sequence as the absolute highlight and also quite gory since many of 999's opponents meet their death on sharp cooking objects like meat cleavers and butcher knives. The acting skills of the performers are modest but they're artists of a different breed! Norman Chu Eddy Ko and Melvin Wong know copious amounts of exhilarating Kung Fu moves and these definitely compensate for the lack of competent plotting. We're Going To Eat You is honestly one of the most entertaining  unpretentious horrorcomedy hybrids I ever had the pleasure of seeing. Warmly recommended to watch with a bunch of friends on a lazy Saturday evening.".

What follows is like one livescreen cartoon as 999 and his various friends repeatedly fight off attacks from dozens of hungry cannibals who themselves are starved of food due to the rule of their nasty leader the powermad Eddy Ko from John Woo's HEROES SHED NO TEARS.This bizarre oneofakind movie has plenty of diverse ingredients to recommend it. Unusually for what is primarily an action movie there is plenty of characterisation and throwaway lines for both the good guys and the villains and the acting is of a strong standard throughout with plenty of amusing performances. Hark mixes plenty of wellchoreographed martial arts into the film's formula as 999 fends off a dozen cleavers and battles it out with the leader of the village. The film has a distinctive visual style with the emphasis on the bizarre and unnatural and plenty of music is ripped off SUSPIRIA which makes for a weird experience. Not only are there a gang of gargoylelike baddies on the loose but there's also a sexmad transvestite and twisted contorted appearances a plenty. The film is fairly violent but with the emphasis on the humour in the violent scenes with bubbling stews of human entrails and limbs being torn off.

Unfortunately every scene is attacked with a sledgehammer and every actor overreacts to everything. What you end up with is a film with no shading and no contrast a loud blob of sound and picture serving no purpose but to assault the senses like an infant screaming into your face for ninety minutes.For gore hounds there is a bit of limblopping and copious blood is spilled but there is zero suspense and endless martial arts fights that come across like low rent Jackie Chan. And speaking of Chan many viewers will recognize the familiar Project A sets on display.Hark's debut feature The Butterfly Murders bored me silly and his followup Dangerous Encounters aka Don't Play With Fire didn't impress either with its confused politics and sledgehammer style. His The Lovers however made almost two decades later is his finest achievement so far a simple romantic drama directed with admirable restraint and style.This film's mix of cannibalism broad physical comedy and kung fu comes across as misdirected and awkward. I'd only recommend this to diehard Hark or cannibal cinema completists. The rest should look elsewhere for their entertainment.".

	schema:headline " The Life of David Gale Possibly the film of a lifetime.";
	schema:reviewBody "No one who looks through that glass sees a person they see a crime.  I'm not David Gale I'm a murderer and a rapist four days shy of his execution' exclaims Gale Kevin Spacey to reporter Bitsey Bloom Kate Winslet on one of his last few days of life.  While Gale might be right no one who looks at The Life of David Gale on the silver screen sees a movie they see a work of art.  This isn't The Life of David Gale this is one of the most meaningful and insightful films created in years.  Its gripping screenplay brilliant acting and creative cinematography explores one of America's most pressing issues in a captivating manner.David Gale top of his Harvard class was Texas' leading death penalty abolitionist and professor at the University of Austin.  Now on death row for the rape and murder of his best friend Constance Hallaway Laura Linney reporter Bitsey Bloom interviews Gale on his last three days of life.  The film is produced as a series of flashbacks exploring Gale's intriguing life and the crime he allegedly committed.Gale was written by former Vienna philosophy professor and firsttime screenwriter Charles Randolph.  The story is full of remarkable twists and turns constantly forcing the viewers to change their thoughts on who committed the murder.  The film is packed with memorable lines both serious and humorous.  When citysavvy Bloom and her intern Zack first arrive in smalltown Huntsville Bloom remarks You know you're in the Bible belt when there are more churches than Starbucks.'  Zack adds More prisons than Starbucks.'  When Bloom first meets Gale the prison guards seem unnecessarily rude toward Gale.  He remarks they are practicing being cruel and unusual.'  In a flashback Gale describes the prodeath penalty Texas Governor as being in touch with his inner frat boy.'The strongest part of the script occurs toward the end of the film when Bloom begins a race against time to discover what really happened at the crime scene.  The last ten seconds expand the film's meaning into a questioning of the purpose of life.  This theme is brilliantly touched upon in earlier segments of the movie.  During a flashback of Gale teaching his U of A class he lectures The only way we can judge the value of our own lives is by valuing the lives of others.'  In our hollow world of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days Bringing Down the House and Old School comes this film that is truly meaningful.While the overall script was extremely powerful it did have one significant weak moment.  On the night before Gale's execution Bloom discovers some odd occurrences at the crime scene.  Instead of spending the night investigating she goes to sleep.  The following morning is a battle against the clock to determine if Gale is guilty she finally realizes the truth just a few minutes before the execution.  The plot would have been notably more gripping if Bloom had spent the night working on the case instead of snoring.  Mr. Randolph Certainly not bad for your first screenplay it is worthy of keeping you off this reviewer's death row.Each actor was ideally selected for their respective roles George Clooney was originally solicited for Spacey's role thank God he turned it down. Spacey's role as Gale was one of the best in his career.  Much of his offbeat sarcastic and monotonous American Beauty voice seems to emerge when Gale first meets Bloom and explains why he called for her.  One of Spacey's best lines ever uttered occurs later in the film when he tries to convince Bloom that he is innocent.  He shouts I used to be the state's leading death penalty abolitionist and now I'm on death row.  Doesn't that strike you as a little odd?' Another memorable Spacey scene occurs in a flashback at the U of A when a seductive female student Berlin pleads for a higher grade.  Gale approaches Berlin and whispers in her ear Okay Berlin I will give you a good grade a very good grade if you would just. study.'British actress Kate Winslet flawlessly pulls off an American accent throughout the entire film.  Winslet's tones of voice and minute expressions reveal a dynamic change in her personality from when she first arrives in Texas to when she leaves.  She enters Huntsville conscious of her status and hardened from city life.  I'm a reporter you're an intern' she explains to Zack when they first arrive at the scene.  Later she becomes so immersed in Gale's story that she nearly suffocates herself when trying to reenact the murder sequence.  This occurs when Bloom infiltrates the crime scene and secures a plastic bag over her head with duct tape to determine how long a person can survive without air.Director Allan Parker took this powerful screenplay and perfect cast and created Gale in a strikingly different fashion.  Parker worked with both Director of Photography Michael Seresin and Editor Gerry Hambling in 1999 to create the depressing slow tale of old Ireland in Angela's Ashes. Considering Gale was done with the same key crew members you would think that there would be strong correlations between the two productions but this was not the case.  Gale explores presentday issues in a fast paced suspenseful thriller. Parker uses a fresh and different film technique when going between presentday and flashbacks.  The camera seems to be spinning 360 degrees as the film cuts between presentday the flashback and graphics of a variety of buzz words like death' truth' power' love' etc. until the flashback phases out the other footage.Parker masters the technique of intercutting to convey meaning.  On the day of Gale's execution Parker rapidly cuts between the jail cook preparing his last meal reporters discussing the execution Bloom trying to tell the world of her findings and finally Gale walking down the hall toward the death room.  These visuals along with the frantic track Media Frenzy' portray the extreme sense of tension.  Similarly in a flashback shots of Gale having sex with a student at a party are rapidly intercut with the fastpaced dancing of the other partygoers.  Parker smartly conveys emphasis through juxtaposing striking images following a scene.  After Gale utters to Bloom I'm running out of time' the film cuts to a steak sizzling at a nearby barbecue.  Parker is comparing Gale's hopeless and desperate situation to frying dead meat.The Life of David Gale is a truly remarkable film one that will force tears out of your eyes and cause your knees to shake throughout the entire 130 minutes.  This absolutely riveting film will leave you thinking for a long time about the purpose of the death penalty and about the meaning of human life.  Beware The film is so thoughtprovoking that it just may change your stance on the death penalty issue.".

While Gale might be right no one who looks at The Life of David Gale on the silver screen sees a movie they see a work of art.  This isn't The Life of David Gale this is one of the most meaningful and insightful films created in years.  Its gripping screenplay brilliant acting and creative cinematography explores one of America's most pressing issues in a captivating manner.David Gale top of his Harvard class was Texas' leading death penalty abolitionist and professor at the University of Austin.  Now on death row for the rape and murder of his best friend Constance Hallaway Laura Linney reporter Bitsey Bloom interviews Gale on his last three days of life.  The film is produced as a series of flashbacks exploring Gale's intriguing life and the crime he allegedly committed.Gale was written by former Vienna philosophy professor and firsttime screenwriter Charles Randolph.  The story is full of remarkable twists and turns constantly forcing the viewers to change their thoughts on who committed the murder.  The film is packed with memorable lines both serious and humorous.  When citysavvy Bloom and her intern Zack first arrive in smalltown Huntsville Bloom remarks You know you're in the Bible belt when there are more churches than Starbucks.'  Zack adds More prisons than Starbucks.'  When Bloom first meets Gale the prison guards seem unnecessarily rude toward Gale.  He remarks they are practicing being cruel and unusual.'  In a flashback Gale describes the prodeath penalty Texas Governor as being in touch with his inner frat boy.'The strongest part of the script occurs toward the end of the film when Bloom begins a race against time to discover what really happened at the crime scene.  The last ten seconds expand the film's meaning into a questioning of the purpose of life.  This theme is brilliantly touched upon in earlier segments of the movie.  During a flashback of Gale teaching his U of A class he lectures The only way we can judge the value of our own lives is by valuing the lives of others.'  In our hollow world of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days Bringing Down the House and Old School comes this film that is truly meaningful.While the overall script was extremely powerful it did have one significant weak moment.  On the night before Gale's execution Bloom discovers some odd occurrences at the crime scene.  Instead of spending the night investigating she goes to sleep.  The following morning is a battle against the clock to determine if Gale is guilty she finally realizes the truth just a few minutes before the execution.  The plot would have been notably more gripping if Bloom had spent the night working on the case instead of snoring.  Mr. Randolph Certainly not bad for your first screenplay it is worthy of keeping you off this reviewer's death row.Each actor was ideally selected for their respective roles George Clooney was originally solicited for Spacey's role thank God he turned it down. Spacey's role as Gale was one of the best in his career.  Much of his offbeat sarcastic and monotonous American Beauty voice seems to emerge when Gale first meets Bloom and explains why he called for her.  One of Spacey's best lines ever uttered occurs later in the film when he tries to convince Bloom that he is innocent.  He shouts I used to be the state's leading death penalty abolitionist and now I'm on death row.  Doesn't that strike you as a little odd?' Another memorable Spacey scene occurs in a flashback at the U of A when a seductive female student Berlin pleads for a higher grade.  Gale approaches Berlin and whispers in her ear Okay Berlin I will give you a good grade a very good grade if you would just. study.'British actress Kate Winslet flawlessly pulls off an American accent throughout the entire film.  Winslet's tones of voice and minute expressions reveal a dynamic change in her personality from when she first arrives in Texas to when she leaves.  She enters Huntsville conscious of her status and hardened from city life.  I'm a reporter you're an intern' she explains to Zack when they first arrive at the scene.  Later she becomes so immersed in Gale's story that she nearly suffocates herself when trying to reenact the murder sequence.  This occurs when Bloom infiltrates the crime scene and secures a plastic bag over her head with duct tape to determine how long a person can survive without air.Director Allan Parker took this powerful screenplay and perfect cast and created Gale in a strikingly different fashion.  Parker worked with both Director of Photography Michael Seresin and Editor Gerry Hambling in 1999 to create the depressing slow tale of old Ireland in Angela's Ashes. Considering Gale was done with the same key crew members you would think that there would be strong correlations between the two productions but this was not the case.  Gale explores presentday issues in a fast paced suspenseful thriller. Parker uses a fresh and different film technique when going between presentday and flashbacks.  The camera seems to be spinning 360 degrees as the film cuts between presentday the flashback and graphics of a variety of buzz words like death' truth' power' love' etc. until the flashback phases out the other footage.Parker masters the technique of intercutting to convey meaning.  On the day of Gale's execution Parker rapidly cuts between the jail cook preparing his last meal reporters discussing the execution Bloom trying to tell the world of her findings and finally Gale walking down the hall toward the death room.  These visuals along with the frantic track Media Frenzy' portray the extreme sense of tension.  Similarly in a flashback shots of Gale having sex with a student at a party are rapidly intercut with the fastpaced dancing of the other partygoers.  Parker smartly conveys emphasis through juxtaposing striking images following a scene.  After Gale utters to Bloom I'm running out of time' the film cuts to a steak sizzling at a nearby barbecue.  Parker is comparing Gale's hopeless and desperate situation to frying dead meat.The Life of David Gale is a truly remarkable film one that will force tears out of your eyes and cause your knees to shake throughout the entire 130 minutes.  This absolutely riveting film will leave you thinking for a long time about the purpose of the death penalty and about the meaning of human life.  Beware The film is so thoughtprovoking that it just may change your stance on the death penalty issue.";

Meanwhile Gabriel Mann Leon Rippy and Matt Craven also provide colorful backdrops to the story at hand with their credible supporting characters.The Life of David Gale is a film that had a great opportunity to create controversy about the death penalty.

By my guess the director is the key suspect though he has a raft of successful films behind him including the closest echo Midnight Express 1978 which is about injustice and a prisoner who is extraordinary. But in all his films that I've seen which is quite a few it turns out there is a feeling of powerful story line carrying the day Mississippi Burning Birdy.

Which is fair enough as a start. The Life of David Gale is a powerful morality tale most of all with some great acting and many or most people watching will be glad they saw it.

	schema:headline " Machiavelli is still alive and kicking in death row.";
	schema:reviewBody "You may think this film is a thriller about the death penalty but it is not. It looks like it true but the end reveals it is something completely different. It is about the way the media can be manipulated in any direction provided you are intelligent. Once a brilliant university professor was confronted in a TV debate to the governor of Texas about the death penalty. The governor asked him to give the name of one executed person that was innocent and could be proved so. The professor could not answer such a question for the simple reason that there is no post mortem investigation in the case of an execution except And the professor started with his main assistant in his fight against the death penalty to think of how to prove that point. In the mean time he is tricked by some dumb girl student into doing exactly what he should never have done have sex with her. She sue him for rape even if later she will drop the charge. The damage is done. He is kicked out of academia. His wife takes his son away and gets a divorce. She sells the house. He cannot even get a job as the manager of a technical store. He is reduced to nothing to being a rapist forever. But he does not want to move. His main assistant in his fight is going to die of leukemia. When he learns that the plan to trap the governor germinates in their minds and they put it through. He is going to be accused of the murder of his assistant though it is not a murder. The evidence it is not is a tape the recording of what really happened. But it will come in three pieces. The man will be sentenced to death. Three days before his execution he asks a famous journalist from New York to come and take the first and last interview he is going to give her in six hours spread out over the three days before his execution. The first excerpt of the tape we have mentioned will turn up in the journalist's motel room on the second day before execution too short and a copy. Worthless. Then after some adventure the journalist manages to recuperate what she thinks is the whole tape that proves what she was thinking after some personal experimentation is right the woman killed herself but who worked the camera? A man that is seen at the end of the tape a man the journalist has seen here and there and in whose shack she has found the tape. But that too is too short though not worthless. It creates havoc and it proves an innocent man can be sentenced to death. During that time the 500000 for the interview travel to Mexico and the exwife for the son. The father had been vindicated in the mean time. But the journalist finally receives the last excerpt of the tape the end of the suicidal demonstrative sance and there the professor is shown coming at this very moment just after the death of the woman just as if he had been behind the camera all the time and he turns that camera off after checking the woman is dead. The media had been manipulated about the guilt of the man and about the fairness and justice of the death penalty then about the man's innocence and the suicide of the woman and yet the truth was that the death had been planned in such a way that the execution would demonstrate how an innocent person can be sentenced to death.

	onyx:emotionText "You may think this film is a thriller about the death penalty but it is not. It looks like it true but the end reveals it is something completely different. It is about the way the media can be manipulated in any direction provided you are intelligent. Once a brilliant university professor was confronted in a TV debate to the governor of Texas about the death penalty. The governor asked him to give the name of one executed person that was innocent and could be proved so. The professor could not answer such a question for the simple reason that there is no post mortem investigation in the case of an execution except And the professor started with his main assistant in his fight against the death penalty to think of how to prove that point. In the mean time he is tricked by some dumb girl student into doing exactly what he should never have done have sex with her. She sue him for rape even if later she will drop the charge. The damage is done. He is kicked out of academia. His wife takes his son away and gets a divorce. She sells the house. He cannot even get a job as the manager of a technical store. He is reduced to nothing to being a rapist forever. But he does not want to move. His main assistant in his fight is going to die of leukemia. When he learns that the plan to trap the governor germinates in their minds and they put it through. He is going to be accused of the murder of his assistant though it is not a murder. The evidence it is not is a tape the recording of what really happened. But it will come in three pieces. The man will be sentenced to death. Three days before his execution he asks a famous journalist from New York to come and take the first and last interview he is going to give her in six hours spread out over the three days before his execution. The first excerpt of the tape we have mentioned will turn up in the journalist's motel room on the second day before execution too short and a copy. Worthless. Then after some adventure the journalist manages to recuperate what she thinks is the whole tape that proves what she was thinking after some personal experimentation is right the woman killed herself but who worked the camera? A man that is seen at the end of the tape a man the journalist has seen here and there and in whose shack she has found the tape. But that too is too short though not worthless. It creates havoc and it proves an innocent man can be sentenced to death. During that time the 500000 for the interview travel to Mexico and the exwife for the son. The father had been vindicated in the mean time. But the journalist finally receives the last excerpt of the tape the end of the suicidal demonstrative sance and there the professor is shown coming at this very moment just after the death of the woman just as if he had been behind the camera all the time and he turns that camera off after checking the woman is dead. The media had been manipulated about the guilt of the man and about the fairness and justice of the death penalty then about the man's innocence and the suicide of the woman and yet the truth was that the death had been planned in such a way that the execution would demonstrate how an innocent person can be sentenced to death. Manipulation all along by a woman who wanted to make her natural death useful for the cause she advocated and by a man who did not have the courage to move on and start a new life after having been destroyed by an unscrupulous student and by his own dumbness students are out of reach as long as they are within grading distance.

	schema:reviewBody "It is strange how much this movie was ignored. It doesn't rank on many critics top 10 list and it wasn't a huge box office success anyway. Weird considering it is one of Kevin spacey's best performances. I almost cried at the end so the movie achieved what it set out to achieve.The movie is about a man named David GaleKevin Spacey who is a philosophy professor and also a antideath penalty campaigner. He was arrested some time ago and convicted on the crime of raping and murdering a fellow death penalty campaigner named Constancethe gorgeous Laura Linney. He has been given a death sentence. He asks for a reporter during his last week to tell the real story supposedly. That reporter is Bitsey BloomKate winslet who shows a genuine disinterest at first towards the case but who has a reputation of reporting on difficult and controversial stories. Bitsey bloom travels with her partner Zack to the facility where Gale is held.The movie has many twists and turns showing the collapse of David Gale's life as he changes from respected philosophy professor to an ostracised man because of some events in his life. These scenes are quite sad and depressing and Gale doesn't have many friends who stand by him in the hour of need. The way the movie flows is actually quite excellent and the revelation in the middle is quite surprising. It doesn't seem like a gimmick and that's where the movie triumphs.The performances are quite amazing. Kevin Spacey as David Gale has given one of the best performances in his career and Laura Linney as Constance is cutesmart and amazingly compassionate. Kate winslet as Bitsey Bloom also gives a great performance as a woman who starts off as indifferent to the case but then transforms into a woman who feels genuine sympathy for the plight of David Gale. The background music is also quite amazing and this is one of the best in movies. At the very least it should have gotten an award for this category. The music at certain points is quite emotional and towards the end it is one of the reasons for the beautiful climax.The only problem I have might be the rewatchability factor. I think I might not watch it again. Maybe because it is too depressing. But it should be definitely watched by people who are interested in the issue of death penalty and its accompanying ethical questions. The questions raised by David Gale in the interview with the Texas governor are one of the best examples. That scene alone is enough for people to watch this movie. The movie is also an example of how one mistake changes the life of a respected person in society and how quickly things can change in life if we are not careful about everything we do. So in essence it is not just a movie for death penalty campaigners and those who are interested in the concept of death penalty. But it is also a movie for people who are interested in human nature in general.910".

The cast is outstanding led by the incredible Kevin Spacey who is one of the most versatile and intriguing actors out there the script is strong and interesting with a moral argument about the death penalty and a mystery with a twist of an ending that leaves you shocked but satisfied with the film as a whole. This a must see film that is very underrated considering it's lack of awards and critical acclaim. I admit that the ending although riveting and a twist I did see it coming and I had it pegged which for me is very unusual. I was a little disappointed that I figured it out but it didn't decrease how much I loved this film.Kevin Spacey plays lead character David Gale. A former antideath penalty advocate Spacey ironically finds himself sitting on death row in the murder of his coadvocate. He cries innocence and with only days left to live invites a top tabloid reporter to take his story and investigate. Spacey does his usual incredible job. The man is so deep and intelligent and just so watchable. You feel for him and feel every moment of his story. He was built for this role and should have garnered an Oscar nod. Kate Winslet plays Lois Lane type reporter Bitsey Bloom. I've never been a huge Winslet fan but her performance in this film supporting Spacey's character is quite brilliant. She intently follows the story and plays an unwilling part in a sick game. Her role is quite emotional but her role is strong and well played. Laura Linney plays victim and Spacey's friend and lover Constance Harraway. Linney's role is small but good and I found her a little bland next to Spacey and Winslet but Linney is usually a little bland however she does decently. Character actors Leon Rippy and Matt Craven both play small but important roles and they add something to the already terrific cast.Equally part drama thriller action and mystery The Life of David Gale is the perfect film to entertain and make you think. It's a win win film because it has everything that a person could want in a good strong entertaining film. It's brilliantly written and has a strong director in Mr. Alan Parker who has done similar films before. It feels almost like an indie film almost artistic in style but much more mainstream than the average artsy film. The film is gritty and sad and violent at times but has this overtone of light and knowledge. It really must be seen to be believed...the film is a must see and absolutely breathtaking!! 910".

Then there are films like The Life Of David Gale which are such a cut above the rest of Hollywood fare that you will be extraordinarily picky merely because you wish an excellent film and been flawless. So what follows is merely a list of petty complaints and may contain spoilers. The reader should take it as read that this film is worth every penny and then some of the price of the cinema ticket or bought DVD. Spacey as always is impeccable. He has that knack of acting well without apparently acting at all. Kate Winslet too was excellent. But now for my list of complaints as this was a thriller Alan Parkers obviously tried to keep the tension up. But often he did so by adding elements which otherwise make no sense. For example our first glimpse of Dusty the mysterious cowboy was when Bitsey and Zac stop because of engine trouble. But wait a minute this can neither be coincidence why would Dusty stop suspiciously on the offchance that here he has come across the car of two New York reporters come to cover Gale's execution? But nor can it be the case that Dusty was able to follow the rental car all the way to the rest stop. And why would he stop anyway? The answer is of course that Parker wants to heighten tension. And why not? you ask. Well of course he can  but it is not organically part of the film. Another example Why involve Bitsey in the first place? Why not simply write a letter of explanation and send it to her with the complete tape of Constance's suicide once the execution has take place? She could still be enlisted to write a piece about how innocent people are executed. But of course in that way  well you haven't got a film. As for the half million dollars did I miss something? Why was it part of the film? Why was it required by Bitsey and Zac? Why was it sent to Gale's exwife? Similarly with Dusty's love of opera this seemed particularly gratuitous an element added simply for the sake of effect. But back to my original comments these are essentially minor quibbles and it is ironically a mark of just how good this film is compared to so much other dross that I make them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possible SpoilersThe Life of David Gale is a tremendous mystery thriller of a film that is an indictment of capital punishment. This film on the outside looks like just a murder mystery about a man who may or may not be guilty or innocent but it takes a wonderful and unexpected turn and ends up being a lot more than that. I have been looking forward to his film ever since I saw the previews for it late last year and was disappointed when it got pushed back to February. I am a huge fan of Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet two of my favorite actors and actresses respectively. Kate Winslet plays Bitsey Bloom a hard nosed take no prisoners attitude reporter for News magazine...effectively Newsweek. She has been sent down along with a bright young intern Zack Stemmons played by Gabriel Mann to the biblebelt of Huntington Texas to interview a death row inmate 4 days shy of his execution. That man is David Gale played by Kevin Spacey a man who has been sentenced to death for the murder of his colleague and friend Constance Harraway played by Laura Linney who was found raped and murdered in her house six years earlier. Bitsey is to conduct three 2 hour interviews leading up to Gale's execution by lethal injection on the fourth day. She does not really know why she is there or what story will come from this. It is a major story because of who David Gale was and what he stood for. That man was an intellectual and professor of philosophy at Austin Unversity and he was the state's leading death penalty abolishinist along with Constance Harroway they lead an anticapital punishment organization. The story is intercut between Bitsey's interviews where we see David Gale's life leading up to the murder and Bitsey and her intern trying to figure out what really happened and why it did...did David Gale kill her? Was he framed or set up? etc. Now with this type of film usually the suspected inmate comes off as a decent guy and you know he didn't do it and eventually the real killer's are found out and brought to justice at the last minute...involving some convoluted conpiracy involving money revenge etc. I am so glad this film did not take that easy route...it takes a startling and ultimately ver convincing path leading up to a story that is truly about selfsacrfice the ultimate of human experience that Spacey's character Gale talks about in one of his earlier scenes as a professor of philosophy. I won't really say too much than that because it might ruin what is a delicious surprise of a film. I understand that some might feel manipulated by this film and dismiss it as taking a onesided stand on the subject of the death penalty. Let me say right now that I am for the death penalty but that doesn't distract from what I think is a very good film condemning the death penalty. Politics is not an issue here for me. The system obviously has flawsone being you have to wait 9 years on death row which I find absurd and this film proves they can be exploited. Overall The Life of David Gale is not exploitative or manipulative...it doesn't pull a fast one on the audience. Howeer it is a film about three people who exploit and manipulate capital punishment to brilliant affect. A story about selfsacrifice for what you believe in and featuring an excellent cast which includes Kevin Spacey Kate Winslet and Laura Linney. Just a superb gem of a film.".

	onyx:emotionText "Possible SpoilersThe Life of David Gale is a tremendous mystery thriller of a film that is an indictment of capital punishment. This film on the outside looks like just a murder mystery about a man who may or may not be guilty or innocent but it takes a wonderful and unexpected turn and ends up being a lot more than that. I have been looking forward to his film ever since I saw the previews for it late last year and was disappointed when it got pushed back to February. I am a huge fan of Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet two of my favorite actors and actresses respectively. Kate Winslet plays Bitsey Bloom a hard nosed take no prisoners attitude reporter for News magazine...effectively Newsweek. She has been sent down along with a bright young intern Zack Stemmons played by Gabriel Mann to the biblebelt of Huntington Texas to interview a death row inmate 4 days shy of his execution.

	schema:reviewBody "I remember in 2004 at the dawn of the Presidential Campaign there was a vast controversy surrounding Bush' military service yet the documents used by his adversaries were proved to be false and the case was closed in favor of Bush. The irony is that the accusation was still valid but since his opponent a distinguished journalist if I recall lost all his credibility and had to apologize about it no one ever mentioned it again and Bush won by default. And I remember very well my initial reaction what if the documents were given by the Bush side this would have been one hell of a strategy you start a controversy to better discredit it perverse but ingenuous.To a certain extent I had the same feeling concerning Alan Parker's film The Life of David Gale a film that created so many high expectations on me during the viewing that I couldn't believe how wrongly it was concluded. The Life of David Gale pretends to be against capital punishment the whole time yet at the end the activists prove to be part of such a treacherous and monstrous scheme that if anything we can't empathize with them let alone their fight. The death penalty wins by default. You could even give the benefit of the doubt by thinking that the film is prodeath penalty as it doesn't even exploit the real basis of its activism which is the sacredness of life. In the film people are against capital punishment because it can kill innocent people so guilty people deserve to die? The film totally belies the whole purpose of the plot and the way it builds our empathy towards Kevin Spacey Laura Linney and Kate Winslet. Either it was dumb either it was misleading in both cases it was pointless.And what's more tragic in that failure besides having in its cast such talented actors and a director of Alan Parker's caliber who proved to be capable to handle politically difficult subjects such as Midnight Express or Mississippi Burning the saddest thing is that one lousy shot was enough to ruin the whole film I'm talking about the last twist with the videotape. The Life of David Gale seemed to go somewhere with intelligence until the final revelation that killed off every ounce of credibility. Kevin Spacey was part of the activist murder. They wanted to provide an example of a man wrongly accused and whose innocence would be proved AFTER his execution. Well apparently he wasn't that innocent and he invalidates the whole point he was trying to make since he wasn't innocent he deserves to be sent in the death row. Naturally it's up to Kate Winslet to expose the truth or not but it doesn't matter. Since the point is to convince the viewers not the film's characters. We already know.And we know that they are wrong. And it's a shame because this was the core of their fight in a previous scene Gale lost a debate because he couldn't come up with a valid example of an innocent executed. Gale had to find a way to be a martyr of his own cause. Talk about a thrilling premise. And then the last shot on the videotape appears and reveals to us viewers that Gale was a morally corrupted guy who didn't hesitate to participate to a killing to make a point. This last scene was obviously aimed to provide a cheap thrill impressing the audience before the ending credits start. Basically the director traded the credibility of the plot just for a last 'wow' effect. Spacey and Linney played characters who were obviously more interested in having a point proved than saving people's lives.At the end I felt cheated because I did empathize with these characters I felt cheated by the screenwriter who came up with the lastminute idea. Why did they do that? Is it because Kevin Spacey is associated with so many twist endings like Se7en or The Usual Suspects he's even involved in a middle plot twist in L.A. Confidential that the film was calling for one? Well it worked in these films because the viewer was mislead only to finally realize how he got fooled but it never implicated his deepest beliefs. In The Life of David Gale we don't feel fooled but cheated characterswise storywise messagewise. Not every film is entitled to have a message but when you deal with death penalty you have a point to make if not a side to take.What was the point of The Life of David Gale it's not because everything seems to accuse a man that he's not guilty well I wish the film wasn't even made if it was to make such a ludicrous point because if it doesn't bring much to the debate it doesn't help those who fight death penalty. I give the film 1 star for the last minute it's so well acted and directed that maybe I could have given more but I can't accept the actual rating on IMDb. Ebert gave it 0 star and I've never been so much in the same wavelength than him I read his review it was like reading my own mind.To conclude The Life of David Gale had the casting the directing the catchy title and the interesting plot line but it sinned by a cheap misleading and fallaciously manipulative twist ending obviously put for the sake of it. To give you an example imagine if 12 Angry Men ended with an additional scene where we would learn that the kid killed his father proving that we was guilty from the beginning how would you have felt? Well the same goes for The Life of David Gale. What a waste what a shame!".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many social subjects which can instantly divide any group of people. To avoid these divisive quarrels it is better not to broach subjects like religion politics or the Death Penalty. For this film taking a stance is the issue at heart. The Movie is called  The Life of David Gale  and it features one of the finest thespians ever. Mr. Kevin Spacey plays David Gale a Harvard graduate acclaimed writer respected Professor and stanch advocate against the death penalty. The intricate complexities within this story are incredible and deeply mindbending. With exam's week approaching the good professor has a quick but consensual assignation with a philosophy student who promptly has him arrested for rape. Despite the false charges being dismissed he is nonetheless rearrested for a new murderrape. The trial and repeated appeals exhausted Gale is days away from being executed when reporter Bitsey Bloom Kate Winslet and her partner Reporter A.J. Roberts Constance Jones are granted a final interview with the condemned man. What they learn and later discuss is that the complex case is far from over. Indeed as she listens to his story and he investigates it they become convinced the professor has not told them everything. This they must uncover before they run out of time. The movie begins slowly enough and then shifts into high gear with the acting of all characters involved displaying an academy award tour De force. What is created is an exciting heart pounding Classic drama. One which will be added to Spacey's long list of great films. Excellent and easily recommended. ".

Mr. Kevin Spacey plays David Gale a Harvard graduate acclaimed writer respected Professor and stanch advocate against the death penalty. The intricate complexities within this story are incredible and deeply mindbending. With exam's week approaching the good professor has a quick but consensual assignation with a philosophy student who promptly has him arrested for rape. Despite the false charges being dismissed he is nonetheless rearrested for a new murderrape. The trial and repeated appeals exhausted Gale is days away from being executed when reporter Bitsey Bloom Kate Winslet and her partner Reporter A.J. Roberts Constance Jones are granted a final interview with the condemned man. What they learn and later discuss is that the complex case is far from over. Indeed as she listens to his story and he investigates it they become convinced the professor has not told them everything. This they must uncover before they run out of time. The movie begins slowly enough and then shifts into high gear with the acting of all characters involved displaying an academy award tour De force. What is created is an exciting heart pounding Classic drama. One which will be added to Spacey's long list of great films. Excellent and easily recommended. ";

Characters are stalked by the unknow man. Who seems to be nothing but a cheap gimmic. And there was that horrible line call the governor the warden call everone that was so so generic.  And the most silly transistions i have seen in a long time. When ever you go to flashback in the story its flashes of words writen and typed on paper with a spining camera. Really lame. This movie tried to have meaning and thats why it fails it did not fulfil its promise to the viewer.  Just watch it on video if you need to see it its really not worth it. I wasted two really good passes on it.

	schema:headline " An experiment that didn't quite work";
	schema:reviewBody "Casino Royale has some outstanding elements. The production design is worth a 10. There are beautiful often provocatively dressed or relatively undressed women everywhere you look. Many of its segments are funny it's even occasionally hilarious.The problem arose in putting all of it together. And with at least five directors and at least ten writers it's not difficult to see why. The whole is a mess. There is little in the way of overarching plot. Most threads are just completely abandoned after awhile.The story which is very loosely based on Ian Fleming's James Bond novel Casino Royale published in 1953it's the first Bond novel is a spoof of the typical adventure featuring the infamous secret agent. The real Bond David Niven went into retirement when his skills were at their peak. This Bond is quite different than the Bond we knowhe is almost chaste he's a homebody he dedicates each evening's twilight to playing Debussy on the piano and so on. Casino Royale has it that the Bond we know from other films is a decoy.A group of older men representing the secret agencies of the US the UK Russia and France are on their way to the real Bond's home to ask for his assistance. It seems that someone has been trying to wipe out as many secret agents as they can. While they're pitching the idea of coming out of retirement to Bond they're attacked. Bond's house is blown up and he implicitly agrees to the assignment. Casino Royale is the story of the real Bond trying to get to the bottom of the sinister agentwipeout plan. Part of carrying that out involves changing the identity of nearly every spy to James Bondif the real Bond is to work unimpeded he can't always be worrying about being killed by the criminal mastermind.Each director worked on a different segment in relative isolation from the rest. This went so far as having their own portions of the script written. The problem was that despite Eon Productions the production company behind most of the Bond films not owning the rights to Casino Royale they had used many of the bits in other Bond films. So there wasn't much of the book left to adapt. In addition it was felt that a serious alternative Bond film couldn't compete against the Albert R. BroccoliHarry Saltzmanproduced films. So Casino Royale producers Jerry Bresler John Dark and Charles K. Feldman had different writerdirector teams create their own parodic Bond segments that would be loosely tied togetherit was almost a filmic version of the Exquisite Corpse game in which you fold a piece of paper so that you can't see other persons' work and you have to continue the drawing on your section with only a couple visual anchors.Each segment features a different set of starsthe primary sets centering on Niven Woody Allen and Peter Sellers with Ursula Andress and Orson Welles. Those are all great actors and great comedians in at least two cases. They all do a bit of their own schtickin some cases they demanded this. Woody does his neurotic New York Jew character Peter Sellers rides the gray area between bumbling buffoon and suave playboy with a couple generic Indian and Chinese impersonations thrown in for good measure Orson Welles does his best Paul Masson Winepitching elder statesman demeanor and also throws in a few of his more famous magic tricks. All of this stuff is good but does it work as a unified film? No. And if that's not enough evidence for you consider that the segments were further chopped up into setpieces.

	onyx:emotionText "Casino Royale has some outstanding elements. The production design is worth a 10. There are beautiful often provocatively dressed or relatively undressed women everywhere you look. Many of its segments are funny it's even occasionally hilarious.The problem arose in putting all of it together. And with at least five directors and at least ten writers it's not difficult to see why. The whole is a mess. There is little in the way of overarching plot. Most threads are just completely abandoned after awhile.The story which is very loosely based on Ian Fleming's James Bond novel Casino Royale published in 1953it's the first Bond novel is a spoof of the typical adventure featuring the infamous secret agent. The real Bond David Niven went into retirement when his skills were at their peak. This Bond is quite different than the Bond we knowhe is almost chaste he's a homebody he dedicates each evening's twilight to playing Debussy on the piano and so on. Casino Royale has it that the Bond we know from other films is a decoy.A group of older men representing the secret agencies of the US the UK Russia and France are on their way to the real Bond's home to ask for his assistance. It seems that someone has been trying to wipe out as many secret agents as they can. While they're pitching the idea of coming out of retirement to Bond they're attacked. Bond's house is blown up and he implicitly agrees to the assignment. Casino Royale is the story of the real Bond trying to get to the bottom of the sinister agentwipeout plan. Part of carrying that out involves changing the identity of nearly every spy to James Bondif the real Bond is to work unimpeded he can't always be worrying about being killed by the criminal mastermind.Each director worked on a different segment in relative isolation from the rest. This went so far as having their own portions of the script written. The problem was that despite Eon Productions the production company behind most of the Bond films not owning the rights to Casino Royale they had used many of the bits in other Bond films. So there wasn't much of the book left to adapt. In addition it was felt that a serious alternative Bond film couldn't compete against the Albert R. BroccoliHarry Saltzmanproduced films. So Casino Royale producers Jerry Bresler John Dark and Charles K. Feldman had different writerdirector teams create their own parodic Bond segments that would be loosely tied togetherit was almost a filmic version of the Exquisite Corpse game in which you fold a piece of paper so that you can't see other persons' work and you have to continue the drawing on your section with only a couple visual anchors.Each segment features a different set of starsthe primary sets centering on Niven Woody Allen and Peter Sellers with Ursula Andress and Orson Welles. Those are all great actors and great comedians in at least two cases. They all do a bit of their own schtickin some cases they demanded this. Woody does his neurotic New York Jew character Peter Sellers rides the gray area between bumbling buffoon and suave playboy with a couple generic Indian and Chinese impersonations thrown in for good measure Orson Welles does his best Paul Masson Winepitching elder statesman demeanor and also throws in a few of his more famous magic tricks. All of this stuff is good but does it work as a unified film? No. And if that's not enough evidence for you consider that the segments were further chopped up into setpieces. There's the M or McTarry funeral stuff the Niven car chase stuff the SellersAndress romance stuff and so on. Each set piece ends up being largely independentyou could almost see this as a series of skits on a similar theme. These facts make Casino Royale not quite work.

It's pointless to compare Casino Royale to any of the other straight Bond films. There is no plot worthy of the name. The five disparate directors saw to that to the extent that the writers didn't. It's a succession of gags puns and visual effects taking place in spectacularly designed settings spoofs of German expressionism psychedelic imagery and all that. Some of the gags miss the mark. A British soldier who has been practicing karate chops on wooden boards comes to a stiff attention when his superior approaches and snaps a quivering Britstyle salute knocking himself out with his own hand. Ha ha. Such silliness abounds and at times the movie drags a bit but there is always another joke around the corner. Orson Welles with his fat cigar at the card table performing magic tricks with flags and scarves amid flashing lights while everyone whistles and applauds. Peter Sellers trying on different costumes for Ursula Andress including one of a gruff old general There's nothing wrong with the British Ahmy  that a damned good swim won't cure. You really can't look for logic in all of this. Listen to the score and watch the performers squeeze the most possible laughs out of their situations. Too bad the movie loses steam at the end so that what should be a climactic pulling together of all the accumulated lines of narrative and jokes is instead just plain silly  clapping seals parachuting Indians. Ridiculous but not funny. Writers who have trouble ending absurd movies like this seem to think that a few minutes of chaotic slapstick will serve. What's New Pussycat had the same problem with people running frantically from room to room in a hotel a Feydeau farce without laughs. Sex and the Single Girl thrust everybody into vehicles and sent them racing down a California freeway with nothing to say. Just about all of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World was an attempt to substitute destruction and speed for wit. I saw this movie when it was released and laughed from beginning to end. I don't find it quite so funny now I don't find ANYTHING quite so funny anymore but I watch it when I can. It's an opportunity to live in the unfolding moment.".

OK maybe with maturity I can see it has dated a little some scenes may drag a bit and a few people may be offended by the sixties outlook on life but hey whadda you expect from a sixties film? What it boils down to is a series of comic vignettes featuring just about every famous face in the movies at the time bringing Sellers and Niven together again after the first Pink Panther movie which practically founded the whole crazy sixties anythinggoes genre of which this is the pinnacle and epitome. Set to some fabulous tunes and on a collection of extraordinary sets dozens of master mirthmakers perform a loopy little dance around the plot of Fleming's novel this film actually contains a lot more of the novel it is named after than most of the proper Bond series. Some of the faces only feature for a few moments Peter O'Toole's part is tiny for one others like Sellers Allen Niven and Welles do enough to create truly memorable characters despite the frantic pace of much of the film I still cannot think of Welles' face without those scary shades.  Sellers does his multitalented thing as usual Niven plays Bond to a tee as the quintessential unflappable Englishman his screen persona provided much of the inspiration when Fleming created Bond and Allen plays his nervy sexmad little stereotype as well as in any of his own films. I can see that this will not appeal to some people but anyone who can lighten up enjoy a little silliness and appreciate that 60s sense of humour will find this a hilarious jaunt round the spy genre. If you do like it check the other installments in this classic period for Sellers  What's New Pussycat After the Fox the Wrong Box and of course the awesome Magic Christian.

So the intent here was a spoof of the thenwildly popular Bondspy mania of the midsixties. Of course this wasn't the first such effort others already began the Our Man Flint duo film series and The Man From UNCLE on TV was in full swing not to mention Get Smart. So how to outdo them? Get five top notch directors. Get as many sixties stars as possible. Get everything but the kitchen sink literally in the overthetop climax. The original intent was to have each director do their own little minimovie spoof  an anthology they ended up editing everything together into one socalled film. A heady brew and predictably largely incomprehensible. In addition actor Sellers the nominal star left before completing all his scenes so his personal trajectory is less than smooth  as if a scene is missing naturally. If you pay very close attention you might be able to follow about 50 of the plot but do you really want to put so much effort into watching a comedy? Some of this editing is quite clumsy the first precredits scene a short one features Sellers as if the producers are pointing out to us that he is indeed in this movie he doesn't show up again until 40 minutes later. Welles doesn't show up until the 80minute mark. The first sequence concentrates on Niven the real James Bond. He's in retirement but is forced back into a weird plot by the heads of all the world's spy agencies. This first halfhour except for the scene with the lions is slow and mostly stupid not funnystupid as intended involving Kerr and a lot of dull fun at the expense of the Irish for some reason and painfully obvious joking about Bond's sexual magnetism. There's also one sly poke at the real Bond film series and its gadgetry apparently that Bond of Goldfinger and Thunderball fame is actually a replacement for the pure spy played by Niven who looks down at the concept of gadgets. Things start to pick up a bit later with the intro of several femme fatales played by some of the most ravishing starlets of the sixties Andress of Dr.No fame Bouchet as the new Moneypenny Lavi and Pettet as Bond's daughter Mata why Pettet did not become a major star is baffling to me. Much of the nonplot involves Niven taking over M's operations and naming a bunch of other agents James Bond to confuse the enemy  SMERSH lifted straight from the books. We finally do see similar plot lines to Fleming's novel involving villain heavy Le Chiffre Welles and one of the Bonds Sellers dueling at cards Baccarat  dramatized differently in the 1954 TV version yet eerily similar.Curiously it's not Sellers who provides the more amusing scenes in this confusing fest as we would expect. No that honor falls to Woody Allen as Bond's nephew and Welles in his brief scenes conducting some offthecuff magic show. Allen's highlight is his very first scene involving the firing squad. Allen previously seen in What's NewPussycat? now proves to be one of the most natural comedians for the silver screen. His mannerisms and body movement recall some of the great comedians of the silent era Chaplin  Keaton especially evident in the scenes where he can't speak a mental block whenever Uncle Bond is around. Famous starlet of the seventies Ms.Bisset pops up briefly in a small role as yet another femme fatale. There's also some mildly amusing commentary on the division of East and West Berlin  yes this was the height of the Cold War  including some almostclever use of color. But all the psychedelic stuff crammed into the tail end of this is very outdated and useful only if the viewer has smoked a lot of weed. This movie also has one of the worst musical scores  almost like nails on chalkboard to me. If you're in a really good mood you may be able to sit through this long movie comfortably if not you'll probably get pretty antsy as the last third begins  and that's where most of Woody's scenes are.

We finally do see similar plot lines to Fleming's novel involving villain heavy Le Chiffre Welles and one of the Bonds Sellers dueling at cards Baccarat  dramatized differently in the 1954 TV version yet eerily similar.Curiously it's not Sellers who provides the more amusing scenes in this confusing fest as we would expect. No that honor falls to Woody Allen as Bond's nephew and Welles in his brief scenes conducting some offthecuff magic show. Allen's highlight is his very first scene involving the firing squad. Allen previously seen in What's NewPussycat? now proves to be one of the most natural comedians for the silver screen. His mannerisms and body movement recall some of the great comedians of the silent era Chaplin  Keaton especially evident in the scenes where he can't speak a mental block whenever Uncle Bond is around. Famous starlet of the seventies Ms.Bisset pops up briefly in a small role as yet another femme fatale. There's also some mildly amusing commentary on the division of East and West Berlin  yes this was the height of the Cold War  including some almostclever use of color. But all the psychedelic stuff crammed into the tail end of this is very outdated and useful only if the viewer has smoked a lot of weed. This movie also has one of the worst musical scores  almost like nails on chalkboard to me. If you're in a really good mood you may be able to sit through this long movie comfortably if not you'll probably get pretty antsy as the last third begins  and that's where most of Woody's scenes are.

It seems impossible to create a successful film with 5 directors and 10 writers not including Ian Fleming but including Ben Hecht Joseph Heller Terry Southern and Billy Wilder !!.  The story lacks even a real protagonist Niven and Sellers trade places in that role.  When they run out of story pie fights emerge or fusillades of bullets or tremendous explosions.The film is certainly not without its merits.  Like What's New Pussycat they did manage to corral some of the most beautiful women of the time together in the same film.  When Andress is not speaking as in the Look of Love sequence or in Seller's shampoo dream she's truly breathtaking. Allen is always funny and Welles does a pretty good turn as le Chiffre. The Bacharach score and Herb Alpert open and closing sequences are memorable.As a DVD extra the American dramatic version of Casino Royale 1954 is included on the DVD which predated Connery by 8 years!!".

To waste any time here discussing the plot would be to give the film credit that it simply doesn't deserve  the makers owned the rights to the actual novel and could have made a 'real' film but instead the outcome is a film that is more like a load of poorly conceived individual scenes. Some of these have funny moments but generally they are silly beyond being funny and are just daft for the sake of it. The design 'humour' directing and script is all very 1960's and I do not mean this as a compliment in this case.The cast list makes this film even more annoying  some of the funniest men alive are in this film but yet they are given nothing to work with whatsoever. Niven is amusing at times but he does no more than play his usual personae. Sellers is a comic legend but this film has him doing a bad Bond spoof and he struggles even when allowed to ad lib. Allen is an unusual find here and in fairness he is actually funny because he brings his stand up routine to the role and seems to just be having a laugh as he goes.Even to waste these three actors is a crime but when you consider that the film also has Orson Welles Ursula Andrews Deborah Kerr William Holden John Huston George Raft Jacqueline Bisset Derek Nimmo Ronnie Corbett Bernard Cribbins Peter O'Toole Stirling Moss David Prowse Burt Kwouk John Le Mesurier and a few others then you have to wonder how so many people were fooled into appearing in this. I can only imagine how good it seemed at the development stage 'Bond but with laughs' but I doubt if any of those involved are actually proud to have this on their cv.Overall this is a pretty awful film but I suppose you may get a few laughs out of it if you can buy into the silly tone but I'm afraid I wasn't even able to get close to the mind state needed to enjoy this. The laughs come occasionally but they are too rare and the plot and actual script are not big and not clever. The end product  a silly selfindulgent mess of a film that is actually very hard to work though and not worth the handful of laughs that you might actually have.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before getting to the actual review of the film a word of warning 1967's Casino Royale has nothing to do with the superior 2006 adaptation of Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel. In fact it's not part of Eon Productions official series of films because it was made without any input from the producers at the time Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Salzman. Unfortunately that's not the only reason that it's largely been forgotten by mainstream audiences it probably has more to do with the fact that the film a term I use very loosely because the plot is so episodic is almost unwatchable.When asked to name a spy spoof most people usually think of Mike Myers' Austin Powers series or Die Another Day sorry turns out that's an official entry in the Bond franchise. But predating Mr. Myers' and his unnecessarily slowmoving dipping mechanisms was this movie produced by Charles K. Feldman and directed by no less than 5 people that right there should be an indicator of the movie's quality. Since Feldman had little to no chance against the official series if he was to make a straight adaptation of the 1953 book he decided to produce a film that was the exact opposite a spoof that parodied the exaggerated ridiculousness of the Bond films. I can appreciate thisI enjoy the Austin Powers movies because they're clever and sometimes hysterical. The problem with Casino Royale isn't just that it's not in the least coherent but that it's just not funny.Surprisingly the first ten minutes of exposition sets up a good situation. The real Sir James Bond David Niven is enjoying his retirement from the Secret Service when agents all over the world start dying. M or McTarry who knows? played by John Huston calls on Bond to find out what's going on. He refuses and for some reason his mansion is blown to smithereens and I believe M dies since he's absent for the rest of the movie and I read somewhere that he does. I obviously couldn't have gotten this while watching the movie but maybe I just wasn't paying attention. The remainder of the movie easily explains why marijuana is recommended while viewing with scenes making little sense and everyone being codenamed 'James Bond' by the end.Most of the film plays out like an extended recent episode of Saturday Night Live. The scenes in the McTarry Mansion are especially dreadful and tiresome adding nothing to the plot except 15 minutes of unfunny padding while the Casino Royale which is where the movie gets it's title from is shoehorned into the script and only seems like an excuse to have Orson Welles show up and play Le Chiffre in a less than interesting gambling scene. But nothing compares to one of the most bizarre and ludicrous endings I've ever seen. And you've guessed it it's painfully unfunny and cringeinducing.Believe it or not buried within this mess are three things that save the movie from getting a big fat zero. Half a star goes to the musical score by Burt Bacharach which is a breezy soundtrack that fits the sporadic nature of what's unfolding on screen. The other half goes to the amazing cast which includes Niven Welles Huston Peter Sellers George Raft Jacqueline Bisset Deborah Kerr Woody Allen a cameo by Peter O'Toole and according to IMDb an appearance by the then unknown David Prowse. On top of that there's apparently 7 actors that could be found in an official Bond movie Ursula Andress Angela Scoular Vladek Sheybal John Hollis Burt Kwouk Caroline Munro and Milton Reid. So it's too bad that everyone especially Allen seems to be doing what ever they want. Finally the auction scenes are the best in the movie not that they follow any logical narrative but because they offered the only chuckles during the entire running time which is 130 minutes too long. The only other times that I was laughing was at the ineptness of every other production value.With a small army of writers and directors it's hardly a surprise that the plot or plots isare uneven characters switch sides without reason and every jokegag falls flat on it's face because of poor timing. The point of a comedy is to make us laugh which is what something like the Scary Movie films succeed in. I bring them up because while they have the same scatterbrained humor of Casino Royale at least you can actually follow what's going on! The troubles that plagued the production including Peter Sellers being fired before he finished shooting and the budget going way out of control prove how durable the Bond series is because Casino Royale still managed to rake in some money. Just goes to show how such a misfire like this along with every criminal mastermind cannot kill our favorite spy. 110".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1960s when satirical parodying silliness was all the rage particularly the parodying or satirising of spies and espionage during the Cold War of the 60s Casino Royale appears in 1967 as a 'swinging' movie version of Ian Fleming's book of the same name which was originally published in 1952 or 53 if my memory is right. But this film simply does not work. The swinging sixties' version of the book is about as silly as it can get with absolutely no art in its silliness. Its attempts at comedic surrealism were in vain.The other Bond films up to the Casino Royale of 1967 starring the softlyspoken Scottish James Bond everyone liked were cleverly satirical and ironic with Sean Connery delivering his lines with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek and a wry smile on his lips. And the iconic 60s' t.v. series that hilariously sent up glamour spies and espionage Get Smart was not only cleverly satirical but an exceedingly artful parody bordering on pure genius with Don Adams and the supporting cast saying their inspired lines written by the likes of Buck Henry with perfect timing and delivery. But Casino Royale an 'unofficial' Bond film and the first to use the name without starring Sean Connery is just silly for the sake of silliness with practically no redeeming features see below.I have seen Casino Royale probably three times since 1967 including at the pictures during its Australian release back then and with each viewing it gets worse. A couple of months of ago it was screened on commercial t.v. here on a Saturday night I think it was and about fifteen minutes' worth of it was all I could take. Even for one as nostalgic for the 60s as I am Casino Royale was too much for one viewer this one.A bigname cast doing and saying silly unfunny things with pretty miniskirted girls with the Mary Quant look scattered round rural and urban Britain are simply not enough to make a film effective anymore if they ever were. Indeed so averse am I to watching the 1967 version of Casino Royale I am even put off going to see the current version of the film of the same title. However I take comfort from the fact that no matter how silly and bad the remade version of Casino Royale may possibly be it just cannot be as silly and bad as the film made in 1967.PS. I've given it two stars out of ten for Burt Bacharach's memorable theme music for Casino Royale and Herb Alpert's marvellous trumpet playing of that theme. The music was the best aspect of the entire movie. All right then! 1967's Casino Royale may have one redeeming feature.".

The makers got the rights to the Ian Fleming novel Casino Royale and feeling it was unwise to compete with Sean Connery they chose to make it a comedy instead of a serious action flick.Not that that makes much of a difference. James Bond spy films have always bordered selfparody anyway so granted this film can't be taken too seriously but then again neither can ANY Bond film. And that's what makes them so great. I also have a hard time labeling this film as a spy spoof since it has an appretiation for the stuff it is mocking and the plot line in itself if you were to take the funny elements out would have stood as a pretty good serious film. Therefore I'll label it a spy comedy and not a spoof.Unfortunately it's really not very good. Despite a huge budget and a terrific cast the movie has a hard time finding its focus. Many unrelated scenes are catapulted on top of each other and while it features many good parts both in action and in comedy the carchase scene is a highlight as well as the showdown with Dr. Noah and though it follows the Bond formula pretty close all in all it falls short. It's not the worst of the Bond films though even as an unofficial one. A View to a Kill was probably the most painful of the whole franchise.The plotline follows the adventures of an elder Sir James Bond played straightly by David Niven stepping out of retirement after M is murdered. He must stop SMERSH one of his arch organizations with the help of Monneypenny's daughter his own daughter and lots of different spies. And he has the perfect plan to confuse his enemy he codenames them all James Bond 007 so SMERSH will be so confused that they won't know what's going on. So we have a typical actionfilled Bond plot interweved with uneven comedy and some dialogue that is at times great...and at other times weak.Actually Niven as James Bond is the film's saving grace. He was Ian Fleming's original choice to play Bond and he does a good job as the retired agent. He is the straight man in all of the shinnanigans and he manages to be suave and dashing as Bond even as an elder man. But that's just proof Niven's great acting skills. He's probably the third best actor to play Bond behind Sean Connery and Pierce Bronson and in front of in this order Timothy Dalton Roger Moore and George Lazenby.So check it out if you're a Bond fan or if your a comedy fan. It's not great but it's not an absolute disaster. Summing it up it's Stirred....not shaken.12 out of ".

It took 6 directors and 10 different writers to complete the movie.

A big problem since there characters have to be in same sequences together.The movie is named Casino Royale but basically this movie and story have very little to do with the original Ian Fleming novel. it seems pretty pointless that they bought the right to the Ian Fleming novel. Or perhaps they simply had to do so in order to get to use all of the official names from the Bondseries since all of the usual Bond characters such as Bond M Q and Moneypenny are present here.Of course over the course of years there have been numerous movies spoofing the James Bond series but because this movie actually uses all of the official names this movie has a more 'official spoof' reputation and feeling over it. It doesn't make this movie better than other James Bond spoofs though.You should mainly blame the script for it that the movie doesn't work out. It's a movie with such an incredibly messy story. Halve of the time the movie just didn't made much sense to me. If of course also doesn't help that the movie it's main character in name is played by many different actors with different styles in this movie.It just isn't a very funny movie for a comedy. Basically only Peter Sellers and Woody Allen mange to put some fun into the film but their roles are rather limited compared to others. Also as a spoof of the James Bondseries this movie isn't exactly good or striking enough. Other movies have handled its James Bond spoofing elements far better.This movie can go down in history as the biggest waste of talents involved. Besides Peter Sellers and Woody Allen the movie also features Orson Welles David Niven William Holden and John Huston among many other great and well known actors. The movie is also filled with cameos from some well known '60's figures and also actors.A messy unfunny movie that is one big waste of all of the talent involved.310httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

This film is much worse than any of the films usually rated as worst ever Ed Wood would never have lowered himself to this level of imbecility and sloppiness!But why did this film that featured some of the greatest names in film history people who really should have known what they were doing turn out so bad? First of all we have the James Bondmania in the 60's people would go and see the film no matter what. Secondlymy theory is that the film is a case of the wrong people at the wrong place. Maybe the film turned out so extraordinarily badnot in spite of but because of all the great names?When Casino Royale was released in 1967 it was one of most expensive films ever made much more expensive than You only live twice the real Bond film of the same year. How could so much money have been spent on rubbish? Maybe it's because no one dared to say no or stop to the great geniuses Orson Wells and John Houstonamong many other geniuses?As a whole the film is unwatchable its a comedy but its never funny. It's not even bad in an interesting or amusing way like the films of Ed wood. It's boring. It's stupid. And above all its sloppy.One scene very typical of Casino Royale is the gambling scene Peter Sellers is Bondat least i think so and Orson Wells is the villain le Chiffre. Orson Wells likes doing some magic tricks he gets to do that. Peter Sellers favorite party trick is to imitate indians and Chinese people he gets to do that. But why does this belong in the picture? And why is it in any way funny?Of all the bad things in the film must also be mentioned the music by the very famousof coursecomposer Burt Bacharach. It's extremely annoying!".

Maybe it's because no one dared to say no or stop to the great geniuses Orson Wells and John Houstonamong many other geniuses?As a whole the film is unwatchable its a comedy but its never funny. It's not even bad in an interesting or amusing way like the films of Ed wood. It's boring. It's stupid. And above all its sloppy.One scene very typical of Casino Royale is the gambling scene Peter Sellers is Bondat least i think so and Orson Wells is the villain le Chiffre. Orson Wells likes doing some magic tricks he gets to do that. Peter Sellers favorite party trick is to imitate indians and Chinese people he gets to do that. But why does this belong in the picture? And why is it in any way funny?Of all the bad things in the film must also be mentioned the music by the very famousof coursecomposer Burt Bacharach. It's extremely annoying!";

The movie is even funnier when you watch it now. If you squint when Peter Sellers comes on screen you can tell that Austin Powers is mirrored off his character Evelyn TrembleJames Bond 007. Thats not the only similarity between Austin Powers and Casino Royale such as the fact that the women wear nothing but incredibly revealing clothing in both movies.

	schema:reviewBody "Before I continue I need to say that the one I am reviewing is definitely not the new film rather it is a 60s spoof of the James Bond Series starring Woody Allen Peter Sellers David Niven and Ursula Andress. Okay now that i have that out of the way i will go on.The film is about an older version of James Bond. One that is still nimble and still stealthy but tired of doing this spy stuff. He goes on one more assignment before fully retiring to uncover secrets behind a sort of powerful agency SMERSH. Well at last that's what it seems to be about. I can't really tell.The film jumps back and forth between seemingly unrelated stories that never come together in any real way. There appears to be a branch of Q that settles around James Bod impersonators and James Bond animals and stuff and it all really doesn't make a bit of sense. There's a subplot somewhere herein that follows a nephew of James Bond named Jimmy Bond. Jimmy is played by Woody Allen who frankly is at his funniest here in a small but memorable role. Add to this a plot involving the real James Bond meeting his long lost daughter and then witnessing her getting kidnapped. There's also a plot surrounding a particular James Bond impersonator played by the masterful Peter Sellers in a pretty decent role as the closest thing to the novel from which it's based.I can't really recommend this film because most people who see it will probably hate it simply because it makes no sense at all. The film is a jumbled piece of what can happen when there are five different directors for a film and none of them are making the same movie. The scenes with no conclusion no context and no lead. There are scenes that are out of order poorly made poorly shot and poorly scripted. There are characters who disappear for no reason and others who are introduced too late in the film to really have any real importance.I feel horrible for saying these things because really it is a very likable film. There are some fantastic sequences full of pure energy and originality. There's a great scene toward the middle section involving an auction that is really quite funny and made me laugh out loud despite the fact that i was watching it alone. I do find the film to be quite enjoyable at parts. The ending of the film at least is really quite fantastic. I won't spoil too much but i will say that it involves a war in a casino reaching to some very far out incidents. I do like the film quite a bit. It's just a very misguided poorly made masterpiece.".

She even acts as a kind of therapist transmitting to the brides and groomstobe the optimism that relieves them of their secondthoughts and that allows them to fulfill their true dreams of marrying. Yet one day a literal faux pas turns Mary's orderly life upsidedown she walks across a street and gets her shoe stuck in a manhole.

Similarly her costar McConaughey is depicted as a goodlooking sensitive man who enjoys his work as a pediatrician. However the film's secondary characters especially Mary's family friends and coworkers are sketchy and mostly inconsequential. Thus The Wedding Planner creates a story that solely revolves around the coupling of its two main characters a choice which makes The Wedding Planner's plot extremely predictable although at times amusing. While the plot complications are limited to the unavailability of either of the two main characters where Steve is unable to abandon his prior commitments and Mary is ready to take up new ones The Wedding Planner is most enjoyable when it creates romantic settings for its lovesick characters.".

	schema:headline " A flawed mildly formulaic but likable and charming romantic comedy that will probably keep you smiling";
	schema:reviewBody "True The Wedding Planner does have its share of cinematic conceits.  Just watching the previews you pretty much have a good idea what's going to happen in the end.  But unlike many romantic comedies this is not predictable by the minute.  The characters are likable and charming and you get quite engrossed in them.  The actors are charming as well.  Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McCoughnahey are equally good and have a fine chemistry. The scenes in general are handled in a sweetnatured fashion without becoming nauseatingly sentimental.  The opening scene is very original and made me laugh.  In the first scene we get an idea of how Mary Lopez plans her weddings staging them like a secret service operation strapping wires to the bride and groom feeding them suggestions as they walk down the aisle and making sure all the guests are in order pronto.  There are certain moments of sitcom stupidity.  There's a scene where Steve McCoughnahey gets his hand stuck to a statue's privates.  The comedy was badly timed and the scene appeared quite lame.  A similar joke was used in Rodney Dangerfield's Meet Wally Sparks but was done in a much more structured manner and spawned hilarious results.  About the member of the cast who I felt was a little hammy was Alex Rocco as Mary's Sicilian father.  His accent comes and goes and in some scenes he struggles so much with it that he starts talking like someone with down syndrome.  Fred Willard has a short but funny scenestealing role when hasn't Willard stolen the show? as a ballroom dance teacher.  There are some moments in the plot that are forced and created simply to move the film along so we can quickly arrive at the juicy climax.  One of the subplots involves Mary's father trying to fix his daughter up with this silly thickaccented Sicilian cassanova.  He wants her to get married to him but she refuses.  Throughout the film they don't seem to have any more than a friendly bond.  Yet later in the film he makes a sweet proposal and Mary actually agrees to marry him.  The ending is farfetched and overthetop and though I can't discuss it you've probably seen this ending before.  One thing I have to credit the writers for is refusing to make Fran Bridgette WilsonSamprasMan is she sooooo beautiful!!! a total bch like they would in most films of a similiar plot.  The way the formula goes is the guy's engaged this girl while another girl captures his heart.  But the girl he's engaged to is usually so unlikable that you wonder why he wanted to marry her in the first place. I'm glad they didn't take that cheap route.  Even Fran has a certain charm to her character.  The charming characters and the charming actors are really what makes this movie worth seeing.  Yes it's pretty much though less than usual a formula romantic comedy but a likable one because of the way we're captured by the people on screen.  This is not a great film it has its dull moments it has its silly moments but it's often a fun and pleasant movie experience.  You'll fall in love with The Wedding Planner.My score  7 out of 10".

The story is one big clich with not even one attempt to make it fresh. Lopez and McConaughey seem to have been cast for their looks only Which doesn't surprise me at all for Lopez as I have never been convinced of her acting qualities. They have no chemistry and do not even seem to be interested in the characters they are playing making the whole a very boring affair to look at. This is not a movie but a commercial product a blatant attempt to squeeze some more money out of the public.

	schema:reviewBody "Jennifer Lopez has gotten herself into quite a quandry of sorts here. Only as of recently has her musical career exploded internationally her focus on acting seems to be diverted elsewhere as her last few movies have been quite awful ie. ANGEL EYES UTURN. Before her musical career took off her movie roles were quite commendable ie. OUT OF SIGHT SELENA. For Jennifer it is unfortunate that I feel she should have to choose between one career or the other because I don't think she can handle both. She is a great singer and she can be a great actress but it is apparent that she can't manage both at the same time. This mess of a movie is supposed to showcase her 'comedic' talents yet displays the worst side of her onedimensional acting abilities.The trailers for this movie depicted THE WEDDING PLANNER to be a few hours of enjoyable romantic light fluff that anyone could enjoy on a lazy Saturday afternoon. Unfortunately I turned this movie off half way through after my nerves finally gave in.Yes Jennifer Lopez portrays a successful wedding planner who is successful in her career but apparently unlucky in love. That is of course until she has a 'runin' with her knight in shining armor dryly portrayed by Matthew McConaughey in a 'phonein' role. The only problem here is that Matthew is getting married to one of her new clients and she may very well be doomed to a loveless life married to some loser from high school who used to pick on her. It's a nobrainer in figuring out how this movie will end.Yes movies like SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING and FRENCH KISS were enjoyable romantic comedies. We all knew how they were going to end yet we enjoyed the two hour journey that we had to take in order to see the grand finale. Unfortunately for THE WEDDING PLANNER the two hours are a rocky mess that tries to pair two unlikely characters with no chemistry whatsoever backed by a soundtrack filled with Jennifer's own songs. The only thing I really enjoyed watching was the San Francisco scenery how can one not love that city?Usually when the grand finale in these romantic films happen you generally leave the theater feeling warm and fuzzy inside or at least basically satisfied for the plot outcome of the characters. When THE WEDDING PLANNER finished I could only think Good I'm glad this garbage is over.For a generic romantic comedy THE WEDDING PLANNER fails to deliver. It could have worked had the characters shared at least a little bit of chemistry but I didn't even pick up that vibe from what I saw. The credits close with Jennifer's hit song My Love Don't Cost A Thing and that generally tops off the point I raised at the beginning of my review  Jennifer needs to choose between singing or acting because her film career is beginning to suffer as a result.My Rating  2 out of 10".

One day she accidentally gets her high heel shoe stuck in a manhole and a taxi man drops his ice cream in the car and hits a bin that nearly kills Mary.

She later becomes smitten with himbut she gets a shock when she finds out that he is engaged to be married to another woman who happens to be Mary's clients Francine played by Bridget Sampros Oh No.Anyway while his fianc goes off for a week Mary spends some more time with Steve and she begins to fall in love with him. Mary of course is supposed to be engaged to MarcelloJustin Chambers who was in Grey's Anatomy as Alex who is sporting a fake Italian accent that is so bad you couldn't help but laugh. Of course you know that she ends up with Steve in the end which is so cute yet kinda wrong as she stole someone else's fiance who was so stupid she decides to not marry him after and goes off on their honeymoon on her own.I think Hollywood is running out of ideas when it comes to making Romcoms as they are loosely based on the same thing again and again.Having said the above I thought it was a cute Rom Com that will have you either loving it or hating it. Matthew McConnaghey was hot in this and JLo was a bit wooden in some parts but still she's just acting like the same character again and again.Nothing new here but still worth watching on a lazy afternoon.710".

I think he owes that to Jack Nicholson's performance since Jack can carry a film so well he also makes the jokes into perfect cues and great laughs. Adam does a good job as well both actors worked very well together and actually have great chemistry. I think everyone would agree that their version of I feel pretty was just so awesome and beyond hilarious. It was also nice to see that this wasn't a typical Sandler film filled with predictable cameo's of his friends so it showed that he could carry the film without doing the common predictability.Dave is a man who designs cat suits for fat cats he has a beautiful girlfriend Linda and seems to have it together only he's actually pretty taken advantage of by his boss and Linda's ex boyfriend. He lets a lot of things go. One day when he is on a plane he is accused of assulting a flight attendant and racist marks despite the situation actually being the opposite. But he is sent to anger management anyways and is being mentored by Dr. Buddy Rydell a bit of a psychotic but this proves Dave's internal anger and turns out to prove that Dave does need help and who might be crazier in life.Anger Management is sometimes a bit silly but I love this comedy it's always good for so many laughs. Buddy was just so awesome in that scene where he has to pull his car out of the parking spot but there is another car blocking him and he just handles it his way you'll have to see. Adam and Jack were great together and I would recommend this film for anyone. Like I said it's not a typical Sandler film and really works well.710".

I've heard bad things about his personality lifestyle bla bla bla but the fact of the matter is no matter what kind of selfish bean he may be he is a remarkably good actor. The way he can put so much life into his character how he can make you believe this was an actual event is amazing. He made the terrible About Schmidt a watchable barely film. And in his earlier effort Anger Managemenet he plays the most annoying man ever to be put on screen including that utterly stupid Gilligan but this time thankfully! to a brainbustingly hilarious effect. Dave Buznick is played by Adam Sandler a calm relaxed cool man despite his troublesome childhood who is after a rollonaisles hilarious scene given Anger Managemnt therapy for 20 hours with none other than the Buddy Rydell. It turns out this two had a past meeting...One great thing about this film which is rare sortof in comedies is the acting. John Tutorro plays the hilarious Chuck anger pal to Dave Allen Covert star in basically all of Adam Sandler's movies plays mr.bigweener Andrew Jack Nicholson is the unbelievably annoying Buddy and John Mackenroe even gets off the Tennis courts to make an appearance as a hilarious client to the therapy. Some of the most standout funny scenes include a bizarre maleprostitute carscene the gutburstingly funny scene in the plane and when Buddy and Dave go on a terrible morally unethical yet damn funny scene in which they kick the crap out of a bunch of Monks. All in all Anger Management is a hilarious annoying feel good film that deserves to be watched by all. Overall  out of  4 out of 5".

Nicholson is supposed to be a weirdo and a man of respectability at the same time but we don't really feel that he is all that credible as an authority and his weirdness is just annoying instead of being funny. He tries to provoke Sandler in some kind of pseudo mental health treatment but how is it that Sandler follows his advice even though he knows pretty early on that he is dealing with a nutball.There are a few decent moments like the opening scene in the airplane with the snotty flight attendants who insist that Sandler is raising his voice but nearly every comedy uses those jokes so that only generates laughs of recognition than great comedy.Another amusing scene is with the Buddhist monk who used to be Sandler's bully. Even though the scene is highly unbelievable it is far better to have the bully be exactly the same as he used to be than having him totally transformed into a good guy. The casting of John C. Reilly was also right because he looks menacing enough and is still kind of soft spoken.Unfortunately most scenes are just run of the mill psychiatrist jokes and the end could not be anymore contrived. Sandler has not made a movie yet that I could sit through saying That was brilliant! but his earlier like Billy Madison had ten times more laughs than this. Nicholson should do a Tim Burton or James L. Brooks film next because he has done way better with them than anybody else.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best I can say about Adam Sandler's films is that I don't hate them. Unlike many of his detractors I find his humor dull rather than obnoxious. But I do have one pet peeve regarding his habit of stealing jokes from recent films then executing them poorly. A case in point I found the 2000 Farrelly Brothers comedy Me Myself and Irene forgettable overall but it did feature an amusingly irreverent scene in which an AfricanAmerican dwarf limo driver Tony Cox who has made a career out of playing characters like this goes berserk after a white character played by Jim Carrey offhandedly uses the phrase you people in reference to limo drivers not blacks. Nobody handles material of that sort better than the Farrelly Brothers and what makes the scene even funnier is that the entire plot hinges on those words carelessly escaping Carrey's lips. This event causes a chain reaction leading to an affair a divorce and finally a mental breakdown.The opening scene of Anger Management features the same joke. Sandler's character utters the phrase you people in front of a black air marshal who becomes enraged and zaps Sandler with a taser. The joke here is not in any way pivotal to the plot. It's just thrown redundantly into a sequence in which Sandler is accosted by the airplane crew who misinterpret his behavior as disruptive.Nevertheless Anger Management represents a transition in Sandler's career. He attempts to tone down his persona of the immature man prone to violent outbursts. His character in this film Dave Buznik is much more normal and likable than the typical Sandler character. But that's what makes the premise so ironic Anger Management is probably the first film in which Sandler plays a guy who doesn't need anger management. So what is Buznik doing being put in such a program? The way he's treated at the beginning on the airplane is inexplicable. It's like a comedy version of Kafka's The Trial where a guy is arrested and sentenced for no apparent reason. He acts perfectly sensible most of the time and it's the world that's turned against him.Sandler does ultimately resort to some of his traditional antics later in the film like his runin with an old bully in a sequence that manages to take potshots at both religion and fat people reminding me once again how much better the Farrelly Brothers are at handling political incorrectness. But Buznik acts this way only because Jack Nicholson's character provokes manipulates and blackmails him. In fact we begin to realize that Nicholson's purpose isn't to help Buznik control his anger but quite the oppositeto make him stop holding in his emotions and start being more assertive. The program to which Buznik has been sentenced isn't so much anger management as nebbish management.Although Sandler's jokes are as lame as usual I did enjoy seeing Nicholson here probably because he appears to be enjoying himself so much. Of all the celebrated American actors Nicholson may be the one who looks the most comfortable in a comedy. After all he has long infused his serious parts with a comic touch. I can't imagine any other actor successfully pulling off a character like Dr. Rydell a hairy snorty man the kind of guy who laughs loudly at his own jokes and will talk for hours when everyone is dying to tell him to shut up but is too intimidated to say anything. Amazingly Nicholson exudes these traits without losing his usual demented charm. He has a fingernailsontheblackboard effect only on Buznik not on the audience.If Nicholson's role doesn't work as well as Robert De Niro's overbearing CIA agent in Meet the Parents that can be blamed on the script which lacks the focus to tell a real story. It seems to structure itself less like a comedy than like a thriller with continual shifts in the plot as we are asked to ponder Dr. Rydell's true motives. But it's a bluff the plot twists are just a cheap way of distracting us from the story's lack of content. The final revelation seems too labored for such lightweight material and only calls attention to the shapeless quality of the earlier scenes.".

Perhaps I am being overly harsh and maybe even stodgy but I'm definitely past the point in my life where I crack up at overlyrepetitive peepee and poohpooh humor.  Lest it be thought that I can't enjoy ANY movie in this genre I should state that I did like Something About Mary. I guess it's a matter of degree.As the movie progressed I kept imagining the scene where actors were reviewing this lame script for the first time and could not help but wonder What were they thinking?  Could anyone seeing this dialog on paper possibly think it was funny?  There were precious few scenes that worked  and most of them were in the trailer.My advice Watch the trailer.

	schema:reviewBody "Anger Management is a highly uneven film that seems ridiculously improbable. However despite this it's enjoyable and worth seeingmostly due to the strange yet engaging work by Jack Nicholson.The film begins with Adam Sandler playing a complete wuss. He lets his coworkers walk all over him and he will never stand up for himself. Oddly however after a very minor incident in an airplane during which time he did NOTHING wrong he's arrested and labeled as an angry man! And as a result he's sentenced to an anger control program led by Nicholson. However it soon becomes apparent that Nicholson is a crazy sociopath. Instead of helping Sandler through the course of the film he makes his life hellish. And whenever you think Nicholson can't push his poor patient any further he doesstealing his girlfriend and getting him repeatedly arrested for MORE supposed outbursts. What gives?! The plot is when you think about it totally improbable and stupidmore so than even films like Sandler's The Water Boy! The ending makes no sense at all it does NOT explain so much you've seen through the course of the film and Sandler isn't particularly distinguished in the movie. He's just too wimpy and unappealing most of the time and seems a bit lost. But in a supporting role Nicholson steals the film and makes it all worth your time. My only advice is that if you watch it turn off your brain and especially try not to think during the last 10 minutes!! By the way while funny many of the supporting characters made no sense at all and were NOT explained by the funny 'twist' ending. However the odd cameo with Woody Harrelson was pretty good. The John C. Reilly scene started out well but soon became repellentwith jokes about a mentally ill sister that are about as funny as cancer.".

I am a big Bill Maher fan and this was definitely the moviedocumentary I was most looking forward to at the festival.I was not disappointed though I think it could have been developed a bit more. It seemed to play to the lowest common denominator in that a lot of issues were touched on sometimes in rapid fashion but none was examined closely for any length of time. Any astute viewer of Real Time already knows what Maher thinks about religion and many of his arguments with regard to the same. I was hoping for a more in depth analysis of some of the primary aspects of how religion can negatively affect our world in ways that people might not intend. The documentary did that only on the surface. I suppose that shouldn't be surprising as the need to draw people into contemplative thought in this area is probably more of a priority than retaining those that already are there not to mention selling more tickets.Subsequent to the showing director Larry Charles had a discussion on stage with Michael Moore with questions from the audience. Larry pointed out that he had many many more hours of footage that didn't make it into the final cut and that he thought maybe a series could be released on cable of this material. I would very much like to see that happen as I think it would quell the thirst I had for more substance with less of the fluff.However kudos for Maher and Charles for doing this. If it is successful in getting people to think about religion in real world terms then it has accomplished its goal.".

The second problem is that the people he interviewed could have easily made fools of themselves without him cutting them off and lecturing them. That being said let's get to the good points.For one thing he makes it so clear how illogical the mass amount of people can be. He exposes phony beliefs and shows how they can become very protective against his film crew. The film stock they put into use is done masterfully. Plenty of laugh out loud moments particularly the image of Jesus as a teenager you will see. My word must be taken as truth when I say that the final part of the film MUST be seen. This isn't just about cracking jokes on faith. This film is about the human race taking responsibility of itself and stopping the damage it has been doing for far too long.I truly hope religious people are not quick to brush this film off.

That said this film attempts to cover the basic tenets and idiocies of several of the major religions namely Catholicism Judaism and Islam. It also encompasses evangelicalAmericanbornagaintype Jesusfocused religion which considers itself Christian but I have never understood that title since Catholics revere Jesus also. But anyway...Maher is a smart man and I would like to think that he considered the points I feel were left out of the movie and chose not to include them for the sake of condensing the film. However there are several facts that I think would have made an even stronger case against mass religion in general 1. Although Maher mentions several times that the JudeoChristian Bible was written by men and therefore contains the fallacies of men he does not bring up the fact that the Bible has been constantly rewritten translated from language to language and amended to suit the needs of those in charge of its distribution  for most of history since Christ this was the Catholic Church and its founders. And for those of you who don't know translation is not an exact science. Languages just do not translate word for word and the accuracy of the translation depends on the skill vocabulary and motives of the translator a human being don't forget.2. Catholicism was successful because it incorporated many old religions. Greek and Roman gods are just a few of those who have direct equivalents among the Catholic saints. Mahar discusses the inherent flaw in a monotheistic religion with bunches of demigods but he does not point out that Catholicism deliberately found supposedly Catholic replacements for the more ancient householdtype gods. Why? Because those who wanted the religion to succeed decided that people would be more likely to convert to it if it weren't too different from what they were used to. Why did these men want the religion to succeed? For the same reasons that people promote religions today to gain money and power particularly in the form of influence. Maher reminds us that the story of Jesus Christ included many elements of older heroes or gods but the film presents this as a matter of fact not pointing out that Catholicism was built upon the success of these preceding stories and histories. The types of dramas that move the human spirit have not changed over thousands of yearsthey have simply been retold and reinterpreted.3. My third point is more of a question. I was raised as a nouveau American Catholic so I feel that I know a little bit about that religion but I know next to nothing about Islam. However it is my understanding that Mohammed did not want images of himself used to promote his teachings. Is this why some Muslims get so mad when an image ridiculing or not of the prophet is publicized? I wish Maher had included this as he did talk a lot about the violence specified in the Koran.This is a terrific film. It is funny and has a great soundtrack. My hat is off to Maher for his nerve in interviewing people who become belligerent when their religion is questioned. I guess it partly comes from being a comedianone must have guts and a thick skin! The message of the film however is not humorous at all. It is truly terrifying to think of all the murder torture and oppression that is perpetuated in the name of religion. Why then is someone who calls himself Godly or religious considered to be a person with wholesome morals?".

As someone who believes in evolution as well as God the film did enlighten me about a host of issues that I had been unaware of. In recent weeks my biggest fear has been that the Neocons were finally going to give someone the nuclear football that truly believes in the rapture. Bush and McCain and Reagan and even Bush Sr. catered to the evangelists because they are sheep and are as strong a voting block as this country has. But none of those politicians really believed things like every word of the Bible being literal. Now Palin comes along and she like Huckabee who also scared me is the real deal. The NeoCons have plucked an actual sheep to get the sheep vote this time. When people with beliefs like that are given power the inevitable result is destruction and that is the point that this admittedly at times hilarious film hammers in during the final 5 minutes. I call Maher a hero in that he fears the consequences of irrational religious so much that he is literally willing to put his life on the line to deliver his message.Make no mistake about it this man will get death threats from the film and I will pray that that is all that he gets. I am not worried about a Christian extremist though maybe I should be I am worried about Muslim reaction to the film though he arguably treated that religion with a bit more of kid gloves than his other targets. I believe that everyone should see this film but instead all the nuts that need to see this film the most will probably be picketing in front of the theaters where the film is showing.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Bill Maher's new movie Religulous at it's world premiere at the Traverse City Film Festival. It was one of the first films to sell out at the festival selling out in just the first couple days of sales.Okay... now for the movie review for those of you who thought that Dawkin's Root of all evil or Jesus Camp were powerful statements then you might want to wear diapers because you might just crap yourself. Religulous doesn't take prisoners. It addresses Christianity Scientology MormonismIslam and other religions. Bill Maher travels around the word visiting the Wailing Wall USA Bible Belt Salt Lake City and other locations while interviewing a wide range of religious leaders and followers.Throughout the interviews Bill throws out zingers and the joke timing is impeccable. Like the procreationist movie Expelled Religulous cuts to a variety of old film stock when making jokes. Although it fails at times I would say the vast majority of the cuts connect and generates hearty laughs.The first third of the film deals with Christianity and several offshoots of it. Here the movie shines. It is hilarious! Poking jab after jab into insane ideas by asking simple questions.Unfortunately the move starts to slow down after he lampoons Scientology. Dressed as a vagrant he appears in Hyde Park's Speaker's Corner and runs through Scientology's belief structure... appearing as a raving lunatic while accurately describing what that religion teaches.By the time it deals with Islam a lot of inertia has been lost. Although it still delivers some funny bits the movie is much more subdued. Granted anytime you are dealing with a subject so inflammatory that people have been killed over it you tread lightly but I think Christians will criticize the movie for being softer on Islam than on Christianity. The sad thing is that it's true. Being the more dangerous religion people seem to be treating Islam with kid gloves. I wonder how long before other religions start adopting that tactic as they become threatened by critics? The ending is a fiery call to action for freethinkers. Rousing music  inflammatory speech hammer the dangers of religion into the audience. Propaganda techniques? Yes. Pretty heavyhanded about it too. However I think it's needed. The flow of the movie needed something to bring things together and although thick with images and rhetoric... it is a solid ending.Is it worth seeing? Hell yes! Will people be offended? Most definitely. Will there be protesters? There should be this is far more blasphemous than Dogma Passion of the Christ or The DeVinci Code.Comparing Expelled to Religulous it's pretty quickly apparent that Religulous is the better movie. Bill Maher with his previous experience doing standup and conducting interviews shames Ben Stein. Nicely done Bill!".

	schema:headline " Some food for thought but Maher undermines himself by being silly picking easy targets and not being as intelligent in his approach as he is capable of";
	schema:reviewBody "I was really looking forward to this film because the one thing I hate on Real Time is when Bill Maher goes off on one about religion making massive sweeping statements about people not being allowed to vote if they believe in angels etc. It is not that I disagree with the basic argument he says but just that he doesn't seem to have a lot to back it up and the odd time he is called on it by the guests he will move along and not really seem to have much behind his general opinion that people with religious beliefs are idiots. So for me this film was not an opportunity to get more annoyed by this but rather give him my undivided attention and let him lay out his case.He manages to do this here and there but nowhere near consistent or good enough to make an argument capable of changing minds  although perhaps good enough to provide food for thought. At the end of the film he gives a very good speech that sums up his film and this is probably the strongest part of the whole film as it challenges and makes reasonable points. OK it is loaded with imagery that backs up his points in a very blunt way but I can forgive him for this. What I have a problem with is that the rest of the film doesn't have this same core of logic and reasoned argument. He hits it here and there but too often he is doing two things. The first of these two things is that he will never give up an easy joke and this is not helped that his goal often seems to be that he seems very keen to mock people rather than reason with them. Hence we get the personal barbed remarks that are thrown out for the audience but the interviewees either don't hear or don't get their response shown. The second thing he does is select really weak people if his goal is anything other than mockery. I do agree with a lot of what Bill says  particularly about the role of religion in world politics. I do believe in the concept that religious tenants within people's personal lives as guides and moral foundation is something I can live with but when things are taken as fact and taken totally literally then things get out of hand. So I do want to see Bill present a more rounded argument and have that debate with people who can talk to him at the same sort of intellectual level.Sadly what we get are interviews with a priest who is a selfappointed doctor a man who plays Jesus at the Holy Land theme park a Muslim extremist British rapper who let me say has ZERO profile over here a man who is a reformed homosexual a man who claims to be descended directly from Jesus and thus now leads the one true church and others of similar quality. We do have experts on the roster but they are mainly used to back up what Maher is saying. Now I know many people do not like him but to me Maher is too smart to need to be protected from reasonable discussion. The only exception I would give is the one priest he talks to who seems very liberal and open to taking the basics of his religion and getting away from dogma and ritual. Outside of him though Maher does not have a hard time showing them up but when he occasionally gets someone who is a bit more careful with language and phrasing and can prevent themselves sounding like nuts the film uses an even more cowardly trick. What we get are Maher filmed in the car talking about the interview which very much gives him the final word and allows him to make responses and ridicule once the individual is not there to respond anymore. I do like Maher enough to watch his stuff but this is a cheap trick and cheapens the film by extension. Of course this doesn't look as bad when you consider the heavy editing in of footage from other films  some of it is fine to provide images stimuli or just as a base but again mostly this is used to mock the subjects after the fact the most unnecessary and annoying example being the use of Scarface  the guy was doing fine making himself look crazy it didn't need the heavy hand.I read a comment on this website that said if you disagree with Maher then the film is not for you it is about you  sadly I have to agree with that. This film will do best with those who are coming to watch Maher put the boot in without a lot of finesse or intelligence  just like he often does on Real Time. There are plenty of moments where he makes very good points and allows his subjects to talk themselves into a corner but too often he is selecting weak targets people at a theme park! mocking them with easy gags letting them make themselves look like idiots which many are and then standing back as if he has proved something beyond the point that this person right here is an idiot which he has not. It is a real shame because this should be a film for everyone  even if not everyone likes it. If he is serious about his plea for moderates to look in the mirror then he needs to make a film that does that and sadly this isn't it. It provides food for thought and I did find it a rousing challenge to religion but it is nowhere near the film that he should have made.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was really looking forward to this film because the one thing I hate on Real Time is when Bill Maher goes off on one about religion making massive sweeping statements about people not being allowed to vote if they believe in angels etc. It is not that I disagree with the basic argument he says but just that he doesn't seem to have a lot to back it up and the odd time he is called on it by the guests he will move along and not really seem to have much behind his general opinion that people with religious beliefs are idiots. So for me this film was not an opportunity to get more annoyed by this but rather give him my undivided attention and let him lay out his case.He manages to do this here and there but nowhere near consistent or good enough to make an argument capable of changing minds  although perhaps good enough to provide food for thought. At the end of the film he gives a very good speech that sums up his film and this is probably the strongest part of the whole film as it challenges and makes reasonable points. OK it is loaded with imagery that backs up his points in a very blunt way but I can forgive him for this. What I have a problem with is that the rest of the film doesn't have this same core of logic and reasoned argument. He hits it here and there but too often he is doing two things. The first of these two things is that he will never give up an easy joke and this is not helped that his goal often seems to be that he seems very keen to mock people rather than reason with them. Hence we get the personal barbed remarks that are thrown out for the audience but the interviewees either don't hear or don't get their response shown. The second thing he does is select really weak people if his goal is anything other than mockery. I do agree with a lot of what Bill says  particularly about the role of religion in world politics. I do believe in the concept that religious tenants within people's personal lives as guides and moral foundation is something I can live with but when things are taken as fact and taken totally literally then things get out of hand. So I do want to see Bill present a more rounded argument and have that debate with people who can talk to him at the same sort of intellectual level.Sadly what we get are interviews with a priest who is a selfappointed doctor a man who plays Jesus at the Holy Land theme park a Muslim extremist British rapper who let me say has ZERO profile over here a man who is a reformed homosexual a man who claims to be descended directly from Jesus and thus now leads the one true church and others of similar quality. We do have experts on the roster but they are mainly used to back up what Maher is saying. Now I know many people do not like him but to me Maher is too smart to need to be protected from reasonable discussion.

Father Reginald Foster  a senior Vatican scholar principal Latinist for the Pope  will stun you as he agrees with Maher on some points. There is unexpected goodwill and kindness from a group of evangelists attacked by Maher they pray for him and really mean it. You may have chills running down your back as you listen to Sen.

You don't need to be a Christian to be offended and amused by the commercial Jesus impersonators Maher interviews and you may feel a bit sorry for the Pentecostals speaking in tongues. Gov. Palin and John Ashcroft neither featured in Religulous are members of that church.After comedy irony and sarcasm Maher turns serious at the end of the film and asks with deep concern if the future of the world can be entrusted to the many varieties of believers in the unreal the illogical the incongruous the phantasmagorical.

	schema:reviewBody "One issue one could have with Religulous is that it doesn't seem reasonable to believe that the religious literalists who are the targets of the film will see it realize the futility and archaic silliness of their beliefs and change. But really if you consider the way Bill Maher speaks to his interviewees the way he comments as director Larry Charles interviews him during the film's road trip and Maher's overall embitterment towards religion evidenced clearly in his standup act and on his show Real Time With Bill Maher you will see that this film is not made to change minds but to reassure those who already understand that lack of necessity and the danger of futility and bigotry in religion that they are not alone and that there are hit movies like this that defend the viewpoints they are reticent to voice themselves.At a recent book signing at JosephBeth Booksellers here in Cincinnati I spoke with screenwriter Joe Eszterhas who recently found Christianity through his dilemma with throat cancer. Yes that Joe Eszterhas. He claims to find it nearly impossible to sell his new script about St. Paul to Hollywood professing that it's because there is a bias against Christianity in the studio system. Maher feels otherwise. His admitted intention behind making this comic documentary is because religious epics that have poured out of Hollywood since the dawn of cinema have endeared audiences to religions that especially in their organized forms preach and imply startling aversions to scientific and historical facts take advantage of certain texts as means of racism sexism and homophobia and other such things.I am just now getting around to writing about Religulous which I saw weeks before the Joe Eszterhas book signing but I can't help but wonder about the differing viewpoints of a hilarious righteously cynical Libertarian with whom I consistently agree and one of the highestpaid screenwriters who has worked for nearly half a century in the very system that he claims to oppose his newfound beliefs. Really the truly surprising breadth of this film's release and commercial success though I do know a few people in St. Louis who last time we spoke claimed it had yet to show there should affirm Eszterhas's viewpoint but actually seeing Maher's film is a different story.This admittedly and purposely biased documentary is about Bill Maher's view of religion. As I find that he usually is he's very smart shrewd and funny and I found the film pleasurable even if from time to time he's a little unkind to his interviewees who come off as objects of ridicule. He goes to holy places in Italy Israel Great Britain Florida Missouri and Utah and talks with fanatics of the religions he confronts there.A good confirmation of what I said earlier about opponents of Maher's views not being affected at all by this film is that he interrupts talks over spots subtitles and inserts movie and TV clips. The film's preaching to the converted and alienating of the nonconverted is not a misstep by Maher and director Charles but rather the intention. We relish his misconduct. The people he interviews are shockingly patient and tolerant even most not all of the truckers in a makeshift truck stop chapel. You are dreading the point where one assaults Maher but nobody does although one trucker balls a fist and says You got a problem. Later in the film there is an interesting moment where Maher walks out on a rabbi who favorably attend a Holocaust denial conference in Iran.Persistently Maher's altercations regard logical inconsistencies of holy books. Did Jonah really live for three days in the belly of a whale? No of course not! It was a large fish! There are people who believe it. Is the End of Days nigh? A rather decent U.S. senator thinks so. Will the Rapture arise in our lifetimes? Common accord. Mormons believe Missouri will be the place to be to which Maher quips with impeccable timing Branson I hope. Maher visits the Creation Museum to which I've been thus I can corroborate the diorama of human children playing at the feet of dinosaurs. He didn't even penetrate the surface of what I saw there.His two most logical guests ironically are Vatican priests who with pleasure write off large parts of widely perceived Catholic beliefs including the existence of Hell. One of these priests dies laughing as he mentions various beliefs that I was taught at Nativity Elementary. The other remarks that Jesus is polled sixth person to which Italians pray in crisis. The Hispanic pastor who believes he is the second coming of Christ will be disappointed.Maher also has ominous questions Muslims about whether or not the Koran orders the death of infidels leading to a frightening climax where he ties organized religion to a premature nuclear apocalypse leaving us with the feeling that religion must be overshadowed for us to survive.Religion is harmful to progress. Faith is the benefit of not thinking. Doubt is respectful. The Republicans I know personally all hate Bill Maher. No surprise there but my point is this There is little to zero chance that they who tend to believe what this film ridicules will see this film and every chance that those of us like me who already love him will rush to see this because essentially it turns out to be a rallying of secularists who should be more alarmed and more active than they are. Maher's persona and his approach to the material are totally in sync with the midpoint of your any given agnostic intellectual young person like me for instance.".

	onyx:emotionText "One issue one could have with Religulous is that it doesn't seem reasonable to believe that the religious literalists who are the targets of the film will see it realize the futility and archaic silliness of their beliefs and change. But really if you consider the way Bill Maher speaks to his interviewees the way he comments as director Larry Charles interviews him during the film's road trip and Maher's overall embitterment towards religion evidenced clearly in his standup act and on his show Real Time With Bill Maher you will see that this film is not made to change minds but to reassure those who already understand that lack of necessity and the danger of futility and bigotry in religion that they are not alone and that there are hit movies like this that defend the viewpoints they are reticent to voice themselves.At a recent book signing at JosephBeth Booksellers here in Cincinnati I spoke with screenwriter Joe Eszterhas who recently found Christianity through his dilemma with throat cancer. Yes that Joe Eszterhas. He claims to find it nearly impossible to sell his new script about St. Paul to Hollywood professing that it's because there is a bias against Christianity in the studio system. Maher feels otherwise. His admitted intention behind making this comic documentary is because religious epics that have poured out of Hollywood since the dawn of cinema have endeared audiences to religions that especially in their organized forms preach and imply startling aversions to scientific and historical facts take advantage of certain texts as means of racism sexism and homophobia and other such things.I am just now getting around to writing about Religulous which I saw weeks before the Joe Eszterhas book signing but I can't help but wonder about the differing viewpoints of a hilarious righteously cynical Libertarian with whom I consistently agree and one of the highestpaid screenwriters who has worked for nearly half a century in the very system that he claims to oppose his newfound beliefs. Really the truly surprising breadth of this film's release and commercial success though I do know a few people in St. Louis who last time we spoke claimed it had yet to show there should affirm Eszterhas's viewpoint but actually seeing Maher's film is a different story.This admittedly and purposely biased documentary is about Bill Maher's view of religion.

	schema:reviewBody "This starts out as any typical documentary where Bill Maher presents that he is on a journey to find the truth about the validity or stupidity of religion. By claiming agnosticism when clearly he is not Maher pretends to be fair by acting like he is unbiasedly going to explore religion saying I have to find out. Shortly afterward one can clearly see that this is purely a Bill Maher ego trip and a Boratstyle type of mockumentary. He doesn't really bring any debate discussion of issues or scrutiny to the table. Instead he just resorts to a religious joke fest which is all very entertaining and humorous but then the real joke is calling this an intellectual documentary on the criticism of religion.To prove his points he finds only the most extreme or corrupt religious fanatics that are even considered nutcases in their own respective religious communities. He especially loves throwing loaded questions to people who are unlearned in their religion or others who have skewed offbase and noncanon ideas within their own beliefs. He questions laymen and doesn't once acknowledge the experts or learned crowd in religion.Some of his subjects include pastors who don't even know what their bible says a Jew who doesn't believe Israel is currently a nation who supports that the holocaust was from God gay Muslims a weed smoking church and a Jewish inventor that creates contraptions to avoid Sabbath laws. These people are all extremely obscure and on the outer fringes of these religious groups.At one point Maher even tries to argue that the existence of the historical man Jesus was up for debate. I don't know if he actually believes this or if he was just trying to fluster the interviewee and make him falter I think the latter. But if he does actually believe this he would be laughed out academia by nearly every scholar theist and atheist alike.Bill does make many valid criticisms of religions but the problem is he leaves no room for any real intellectual rebuttal. He is mostly catching people offguard and asking loaded questions. He had some good points like on the U.S. not being founded as a Christian nation or the absurd idea that Christianity is American. But there were other claimed facts completely false like his information on the HorusJesus debate or pulling despicable Biblical stories and not really addressing what those passages were actually about. Maher also asserts that all religion is violent when in fact just as much or more violence has been done in the name of no religion. He eventually moves on to other religions but really never far from Judaism based ones which really doesn't touch on most of the world.This is without a doubt a very funny piece unless you are extremely offended by it all but it would be completely inaccurate to call it an intellectual one. It's just Bill Maher being Bill Maher. Even to the point of him bringing up other irrelevant issues like his views on the environment and nuclear applications. He didn't actually do extensive research he's mostly just shooting from the hip and catching dumb people offguard. The makers even cut the scenes cleverly in the interviews weird pauses strange faces for extra awkwardness and comedy.The only thing this documentary really proved was that there are a lot of people that believe strange things some of them being very stupid. Most people watching this already knew that beforehand. At one point Maher says Religion is arrogant certitude which ironically also perfectly describes himself.".

He seems to believe it himself when asked directly by Bill Maher.And Holy Land in Florida? An audience watches in awe as the Crucifixion of Jesus is reenacted.

	schema:reviewBody "After watching this movie I felt a bit like getting a wrappedup roll of toilet paper for Christmas accompanied by a card that says 'It's the thought that counts'.Any roundabout approach to a difficult subject will invariably have its shortcomings but 'Religulous' in my humble view never makes off the ground of its failed premise and overbearing protagonist who is all but funny in his annoying showman attitude.I consider myself part of the target demographic group of agnostic academics with an alternative lifestyle but I'm still rather offended by Bill Maher. It is usually more offending when a media product tries to pass itself off as smarter than it is instead of focusing on plain entertainment.Bill Maher's premise and ultimate message is that if the dissenting minority of this world does not unite against raving religious fanatics these may bring civilization to ultimate ruin. He does not address the interesting question of how such a union could be achieved and how it is supposed to vanquish fanaticism without resorting to fanatical methods. He also ignores the fact that conflict between intelligence and religion is not necessarily a latterday occurrence but can be traced redthread like through the histories of all civilizations.He criticizes intellectual timidity in the face of ridiculous gibberish altogether ignoring that such humble timidity is in fact a rather quintessential feature of intelligence per se. He resorts to scientific generalizations to counter theological generalizations of his fairly unimpressive interview partners or better to say victims as he wastes no time to rush into revealing them as frauds. In order to achieve this objective he frequently jumps to irrelevant conclusions confusing his victims so that a closeup camera shot may catch a puzzled face thus the viewer may go ha! there you have it just another phony. As if anyone interested in the film's subject would not already have his or her own doubts on that. Inbetween these shenanigans Maher and his crew have themselves evicted from the Vatican and the grounds of the Mormon temple in Salt Lake City going oh! see how intolerant these religulous people are. As if any of us would not call the police if a camera team posted itself on our front lawn without prior notice.To justify my complete dismissal of this film let me elaborate on one detail. Maher juxtaposes the pseudoChristian statements of a 'reformed' former gay man counseling other homosexuals to that end with a twosecond snippet of footage confirming with a scientist the existence of a 'gay gene'. That is to say look a scientist says there is a gay gene so it's an established fact that gays are biologically preconditioned and here you are talking about what the bible says. That is just as totalitarian an approach as saying gays are an abomination to god if you want to eliminate the element of choice from such an individually complex field as sexuality you're being as dogmatic as the haters. Another very critical issue is the treatment of Islam. There is some footage of a Mollah rambling 'In the name of peace all infidels must die' or so and Maher refers to the Fatwa against Salman Rushdie as a hint to a general intolerance of free speech in Islam rather than fanaticism being the result of politics as his Muslim interviewees say. He ignores the fact that the highest authorities of Islam dismissed this Fatwa and excommunicated its instigator Ayatollah Khomeini and that Rushdie himself is of a Muslim background and has attributed the Fatwa to the political radicalization of Islam. Maher also alleges that Muslims would never agree to an outsider that something is wrong with their religion. Obviously Maher is not familiar with the works of Tariq Ali Edward Said or even Rushdie himself who all call for a reform of Islam. This makes me suspect that much of the criticism against religion in general is actually voiced in order to be able to bash Islam in a 'politically correct' way.Sadly 'Religulous' points out that dogmas can only be replaced by other dogmas in public discourse. I give it to Maher that 'either you agree with me or you are a loony' is still a better statement than 'either you agree with me or you're an enemy of god'. But the fact remains that all there is to see in this film is the competition of attentiongrabbing individuals too full of themselves to care how similar they are to each other.".

Instead he focuses on how Muslims see women and try's to show that Muslims are aggressive people. A VERY subjective documentary.Which brings me to the conclusion. Its one thing showing the crazy things you see in religion... But not exploring what evidence each religion brings as proof changes this from a documentary about religion to a documentary about things from religion that will sound crazy to you.It has its funny moments and even though i only gave it 6 out of 10 i can still recommend this but only to people who shares his opinion.

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of all things Bill Maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting. Of course I am Catholic come from a welleducated family and go to church of my own volition which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of Bill's opinions.Bill's problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative. He's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i.e. one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion or more accurately by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of God but that said he never looks at its positive side. Quite frankly I think that hell would freeze over before Bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of Calcutta where Mother Theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor. She's dead now of course but he could easily visit the Jesuit priest in East LA who runs Homeboy Industries which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills get their tattoos removed and to become responsible members of society or he could visit USC's Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies which has brought together some of the world's finest theologians diplomats and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than 1 a day. Of course he won't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion and it's so much easier to continue to make snide superficial jokes.That fits into the other large problem with Bill's movie which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is. In this movie you have Maher the Cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational Christian truck stop service in a night club with a Dutch guy who smokes pot all the time with the minister of a storefront church in Miami who claims to be the reincarnation of Christ and with an actor playing Jesus at a Holy Land theme park.What you won't see in Bill's film beyond some superficial speculation alongside a Ph.D in Grand Central Station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like Notre Dame BYU or Wheaton College who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter. You won't see any serious discussion of any of the writings of C.S. Lewis G.K. Chesterton or any papal encyclicals and of course you also won't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the nonAbrahamic Judaism Christianity and Islam faiths whatsoever. All you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending snobby elitist from the west side of LA who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gutlevel understanding whatsoever of how the other half of America that elected George W. Bush twice lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it.I get a lot of what Bill's saying but for someone possessing his intellect and influence this film was nothing less than pathetic. Anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the Teletubbies.".

	schema:headline " An ill prepared and passionless Bill Maher takes cheap shots at belief. Its amusing to a point but far from deep";
	schema:reviewBody "Bill Maher's essay on religion is disappointing and not very good.The film is essentially Maher traveling around talking to people about God and religion in the most cursory of ways. Its Maher asking softball questions to people who fumble and stumble and look silly while Maher looks ill prepared.I wanted to either love this film or hate it. I wanted to walk out of it fired up about it in a pro or con way. Instead I walked out of it wondering why Maher bothered.This is not the Maher from his TV show asking pointed questions and leveling scathing observations this Bill Maher the Wuss asking everyday people questions that aren't very good and then talking over their answers. The people all look like nice people who believe what they believe even if its silly. There is nothing in the film other than Maher's use of suicide bombers and explosions to indicate why he comes to his point at the end that religion is so dangerous.The first 90 minutes does not justify the last 9 A final nine that is sorely lacking in passion. I found it troubling that Maher never seemed to do his home work. He could occasionally quote well known scripture but there was never any sense he knew the history.certainly his assertion that Jesus never lived is questionable since Josephus does fleetingly mention him granted with out the details The criticism thats been leveled at the film that its too Christian centric is right on. The Jewish Islamic and Scientological portions of the film feel unformed and half thought out actually a quarter thought out since the film is for me half thought out. Maher talks about what he knows which is why I'm guessing there is nothing on Eastern religions.And I guess the Cannabis church which preaches nothing was there so Bill could write off the expense of getting high.Why is that segment in the film?  I'm also troubled by Maher's repeated assertions that people who are defending their religion as they see it or expressing how they feel are lying to him. Take for example the Muslim woman he speaks to in Denmark who expresses her view of the Koran and her religion. There is a cut away of him saying that she's lying and covering up for her religion. Oh really at what point did he gain the ability to get into peoples minds? It would be fine if he clued us as to why he felt this but mostly its just his word against hers.What I want to know is where is the passion? Where is the sense of drive to know? This seems to be Maher driving around in a limo asking people that are easy targets questions that he know will provoke a reaction. There is a real sense of cut and paste journalism in the drive for a quick answer. I would like to see the entire interviews of some of the people he talks to especially the priest he talks to in the Vatican observatory here's a guy who isn't a boob who probably could talk rings around Maher and yet we get scant time with him. additionally I'm curious what the whole interview of the Rabbi who went to Iran was like since Maher simply talked over the man's attempts to answer. I left the film wondering why I bothered in a neutral way. The film was just sort of there.In the end what struck me was that Maher's assertion that we should doubt and we should is just as religious and pigheadedly fundamentalist just like a terrorist. Its also a belief that seems to come from the place of if I can't have this no one can or if I don't feel this no one can. After all he states in his final speech that since he doesn't have the answers no one does which is a nice way to feel but isn't necessarily true.Is it a bad film? Not if you just want an amusing if jaundiced look at what we belief there are some laughs. As viable commentary or criticism of religion its weak and insubstantial since had Maher really done his home work he could have used facts instead of jokes and stolen clips to make his point.5 ish out of 10.".

There is nothing in the film other than Maher's use of suicide bombers and explosions to indicate why he comes to his point at the end that religion is so dangerous.The first 90 minutes does not justify the last 9 A final nine that is sorely lacking in passion. I found it troubling that Maher never seemed to do his home work. He could occasionally quote well known scripture but there was never any sense he knew the history.certainly his assertion that Jesus never lived is questionable since Josephus does fleetingly mention him granted with out the details The criticism thats been leveled at the film that its too Christian centric is right on. The Jewish Islamic and Scientological portions of the film feel unformed and half thought out actually a quarter thought out since the film is for me half thought out. Maher talks about what he knows which is why I'm guessing there is nothing on Eastern religions.And I guess the Cannabis church which preaches nothing was there so Bill could write off the expense of getting high.Why is that segment in the film?  I'm also troubled by Maher's repeated assertions that people who are defending their religion as they see it or expressing how they feel are lying to him. Take for example the Muslim woman he speaks to in Denmark who expresses her view of the Koran and her religion. There is a cut away of him saying that she's lying and covering up for her religion. Oh really at what point did he gain the ability to get into peoples minds? It would be fine if he clued us as to why he felt this but mostly its just his word against hers.What I want to know is where is the passion? Where is the sense of drive to know? This seems to be Maher driving around in a limo asking people that are easy targets questions that he know will provoke a reaction. There is a real sense of cut and paste journalism in the drive for a quick answer. I would like to see the entire interviews of some of the people he talks to especially the priest he talks to in the Vatican observatory here's a guy who isn't a boob who probably could talk rings around Maher and yet we get scant time with him. additionally I'm curious what the whole interview of the Rabbi who went to Iran was like since Maher simply talked over the man's attempts to answer. I left the film wondering why I bothered in a neutral way. The film was just sort of there.In the end what struck me was that Maher's assertion that we should doubt and we should is just as religious and pigheadedly fundamentalist just like a terrorist. Its also a belief that seems to come from the place of if I can't have this no one can or if I don't feel this no one can. After all he states in his final speech that since he doesn't have the answers no one does which is a nice way to feel but isn't necessarily true.Is it a bad film? Not if you just want an amusing if jaundiced look at what we belief there are some laughs. As viable commentary or criticism of religion its weak and insubstantial since had Maher really done his home work he could have used facts instead of jokes and stolen clips to make his point.5 ish out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Set in the Cameroons in West Africa in the 1950s Claire Denis' Chocolat is a beautifully photographed and emotionally resonant tone poem that depicts the effects of a dying colonialism on a young family during the last years of French rule. The theme is similar to the recent Nowhere in Africa though the films are vastly different in scope and emphasis. The film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country. France Dalens Mireille Perrier a young woman traveling through Cameroon recalls her childhood when her father Francois Cluzet was a government official in the French Cameroons and she had a loving friendship with the brooding manservant Prote Isaach de Bankol. The heart of the film however revolves around France's mother Aime Giulia Boschi and her lovehate relationship with Prote that is seething with unspoken sexual tension. The household is divided into public and private spaces. The white families rooms are private and off limits to all except Prote who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower outdoors exposing their naked bronze bodies to the white family's gazes. It becomes clear when her husband Marc Franois Cluzet goes away on business that Aime and Prote are sexually attracted to each other but the rules of society prevent it from being openly acknowledged. In one telling sequence she invites him into her bedroom to help her put on her dress and the two stare at each other's image in the mirror with a defiant longing in their eyes knowing that any interaction is taboo. The young France Cecile Ducasse also forms a bond with the manservant feeding him from her plate while he shows her how to eat crushed ants and carries her on his shoulders in walks beneath the nocturnal sky. In spite of their bond the true nature of their masterservant relationship is apparent when France commands Prote to interrupt his conversation with a teacher and immediately take her home and when Prote stands beside her at the dinner table waiting for her next command. When a plane loses its propeller and is forced to land in the nearby mountains the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located. Each visitor shows their disdain for the Africans one a wealthy owner of a coffee plantation brings leftover food from the kitchen to his black mistress hiding in his room. Another Luc JeanClaude Adelin an arrogant white Frenchman upsets the racial balance when he uses the outside shower eats with the servants and taunts Aime about her attraction to Prote leading her to a final emotional confrontation with the manservant.Chocolat is loosely autobiographical adapted from the childhood memories of the director and is slowly paced and as mysterious as the brooding isolation of the land on which it is filmed. Denis makes her point about the effects of colonialism without preaching or romanticizing the characters. There are no victims or oppressors no simplistic good guys. Prote is a servant but he is also a protector as when he stands guard over the bed where Aime and her daughter sleep to protect them from a rampaging hyena. It is a sad fact that Prote is treated as a boy and not as a man but Bankol imbues his character with such dignity and stature that it lessens the pain. Because of its pace Western audiences may have to work hard to fully appreciate the film and Denis does not in Roger Ebert's phrase coach our emotions. The truth of Chocolat lies in the gestures and glances that touch the silent longing of our heart.".

One relatively forgettable but covering the same geography is Coup de Torchon the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of Indochine the complex and unspoken relationship between France and her colonial subjects.I was struck with the dignity of Potee with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses. I was also struck with the lovehate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter that gives the film its driving force it is the latter that links this movie to Indochine.One never is sure what motivates everyone though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that ties it to Coup de Torchon. Theirs is the more scandalous story perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way but Denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships.The American black who gives the grown up France a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the Western world have when we look at Africa. He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother. He was coming home but they just thought him to be a little daft. France the character and the girl grew up in Cameroon but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was.".

	schema:headline " Very good but it's still missing something...";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an amazing film to watch or show young people. Aside from a very brief nude scene it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in Africa that you'll rarely find in other films. It does bear a superficial similarity to OUT OF Africa but without all the romantic fluff. The White French people in Cameroon are fascinating because they don't even seem to regard the natives as people. The Whites are all the bosses and they expect Black servitude without question. However unlike real servants you only once hear any of the Whites say 'thank you' and no other regard is given these people. Again and again it's like they are pets or slaves as the feelings of the people are never even considered. The central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother Aime and her servant Prote. Although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other the White woman never considers Prote or the existence of his feelings. A good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has Prote lace up her dress and it's obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this. Apart from this relationship while almost all the Whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the Africans are people a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage.Also interesting is the relationship between Prote and the little girl who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film. While they are very close at times he's more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native children.There is one bizarre White character who seems at times to regard the Blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing. One moment he's doing hard work along side the Blacks or eating with them something the other Whites would never have done and the next he's trying to beat up Prote! I could only guess as to what motivated himperhaps he was just a jerk or was crazy or perhaps was a Communist agitator trying to stir up the Blacks against the Whites who knows!. In fact other than a few good scenes this character seems pretty much wasted.While I really enjoyed the insight this movie gave I wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life. The context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more. The film appeared to begin in the early 1980s since she's wearing a Walkmanstyle headset and when the film went back in time it seems that it was set about 1960 more or less but there was never any mention of the 1950s anticolonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early 1960s. I am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and SHOULD have made the beginning of the film earlier such as the 1970s and had the lady think back to her life there in the early 1950sbefore the country experienced political change.Apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea. And I also appreciated the ending as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride. But overall it just feels like something is missingthere just isn't any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel.".

The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient. For example a central theme in the story is young France's inability to form strong relationships with others. Although this portrayal is executed flawlessly notably in the way that Denis frames the story with scenes from France's return to her childhood home the girl's lack of intimacy with the film's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development or lack thereof as a protagonist. The general stagnation of the film's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot. The film raises a great deal of tension between characters particularly between Aimee and the men in her life but never fully addresses this social friction leaving the viewer unsatisfied. The final few scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.".

	schema:headline " Sometimes getting what you want isn't always best for you.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a film ostensibly about a young woman's quest to revisit the land of her childhood experiences. It deals more however with the complex relationship between her her mother and the black house boy who is used at various times as a servant a substitute father and substitute man of the house when her father is away doing administrative governmental work in other areas of the country.As a child the girl had difficulty making relationships with her peers and there is a restrained attraction between the mother Aimee and Prote the house boy. Suppose a sexual relationship had developed between Aimee and Prote what then? The simmering tension is removed to be replaced by what? Clearly Aimee is not going to kick her husband out and set up house with Prote and where would that leave him? To remain a servant and be picked up and put down as the 'Lady Boss' saw fit. He would be in a worse position than before but without his dignity. In a situation where a hierarchy exists then sometimes it is better to not have what you want. The obvious answer is to get rid of the hierarchy which is what the end of colonialism was in theory moving towards but this also removes the family's reason for being there anyway. A telling scene not mentioned by others is when Aimee makes a subtle play for Prote whilst he is drawing the curtains at the end of the day. Without saying a single word he brings her out of her reverie and leaves her in no doubt as to the nature of their relationship. Because she leads an unfulfilled existence she accuses her husband of being 'too nice' when in fact he has done nothing wrong.The film ends with the clear conclusion that whether they are subjugated or not westerners are definitely the black mans burden and it doesn't matter on the colour of your skin whether theirs is the only culture you have ever known or how much you empathize with them if you are not black and born there you are never going to be one of them. A distinct example of inverse multiculturalism.In the final scene where the airport baggage handlers get caught in a tropical storm it would have been nice if they had actually got wet. But hey life is not always about getting what you want.".

It's a sense consistent with another movie I've seen about Africa in a similar time period Nirgendwo in Afrika 2001 but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression  things do happen in the movie  but the plot is understated.

The rest of the ragtag ensemble is just forgettable. The black Africans are to say the least offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the director's poor handling of her material.

Most movies never develop a love story.....rather they jump into some steamy sexual situation. What happened to leaving things to our imagination....Happily Ever After!!! Don't get me wrong the script was lacking at times but the performers made up for it with energy and realism. Who can't relate to being torn between something you love and something you want. Vanessa L. Williams is outstanding. If she had starred in MOULIN ROUGE I may have been able to watch the whole thing. Vanessa is one of the few MULTITALENTED PERFORMERSsinger actress and NOW danceroverlooked by Hollywood. Few women can do it all. Not since the likes of Judy Garland Audrey Hepburn and Ginger Rodgers.

Sometimes I just forgot that they were telling a story because almost in every scene there was movement feeling and attention in the dance choreography. It was a wonderful display of dancing and choice in music. Some may not like the movie because it lacks a strong storyline but there are no new ideas. We all know what hidden behind door number 1 2 and 3. Nonetheless it is not that the movie doesn't stray into the unknown it is that the movie has attraction heat and passion especially with the chemistry between Chayanne and Vanessa. I even like the music video that complements the movie. Chayanne has done a great job in his first English role and better yet he has the moves to back it up. Although Vanessa is heard in the movie speaking extremely poor Spanish she did a wonderful job in the Spanish version of You are my home it was great!".

I read the cable synopsis and thought Uh oh! Clich city! But to my surprise this film was not clichd and the film was like a breath of fresh air. The performances for the most part were true and honest. Chayenne as Rafael a Cuban migr is charming and acts well in his Englishlanguage film debut. Vanessa Williams is stunning as always. And the music! Picante! The dance sequences are excellent and Chayenne is an excellent dancer as is Vanessa. Chayenne has a soulful demeanor and with his eyes and subtle facial inflections he made me feel his loneliness as a stranger in a new land. Many times I thought the film would sink into gooey sentimentality but again to my surprise it rose above such obviousness. The best scene in the film is when Chayenne is caught in a lawn sprinkler system that turns on unexpectedly. With great charm and wit Chayenne does an excellent homage to Gene Kelly but with his own style and grace. A wonderful and funny scene. I recommend this film if you want to hear some great Latin music see some great dancing and be captivated by Chayenne and the beautiful Vanessa Williams. By the way Kris Kristofferson is very good as the man who gives Rafael Chayenne a place to live upon arriving from Cuba and who plays a key role in Rafael's adjustment to a new life in America.".

The Chemistry between the two leads is electrifying especially evident in the Dance championships and in the club scenes. Well casted.

The music is so incredibly catchy  I have the soundtrack which also contains a couple of songs not in the movie which should be but unfortunatly leaves out some that are in the movie that should  be on the CD as well! There is also Dance with Me 2 which contains songs not in the movie but in the syle of. Features Chayanne and Vanessa Williams Gloria Estefan Sergio Mendes DLG who have a role in the movie performing at the club Rafael and Ruby go to Ruban Blades and more! I think I must have seen this movie over 25 times and I never get sick of it! I've almost memorised the script! Would have been nice to embelish the fatherson relationship of Rafael and John Kris Kristofferson but this may well have detracted from the dance scenes. And I definatly would have liked more on the romance between the two leads...! I hope Chayanne does more movies as he has a talent for it and I'm hanging out for more perving!

You can tell director Randa Haines is a fan of the dancing the way she lovingly photographs it and gives all the dancers a chance to shine especially during the long dance scene at the club.  She's also the first director who really gives Williams a chance to cut loose and show her talent.  I don't know much about Chayanne but he's good too.So the plot isn't much.  Who watches musicals just for the plot?  And actually I liked how they handled certain aspects like the dance competition and how Chayanne and Williams resolve their feelings for one another without even dancing together.

I could hardly take my eyes off of him during the entire movie.  Watch for the scene where he dances in the sprinklers he's absolutely charming!  I could go on for days about him but I'll spare you. Vanessa Williams Ruby is every bit his equal though not only is she breathtakingly beautiful but her dancing is some of the best I've ever seen in any movie. I still can't figure out how she dances so well in those shoes! As for the supporting cast Joan Plowright Bea can even steal a scene from Chayanne!  She's adorable as one of the older but very enthusiastic dance students.  Her second performance in the Las Vegas competition is another one of my favorite scenes.  Do not miss this movie! Now where do I sign up for Chayanne's fan club???".

Dance movies are almost always weak in either acting or dancing and the stories are often just filler to pass time and loosely connect the dance scenes. Not so with DWM where the chemistry of the characters is so strong it makes the story believable even though it is predictable. The production values are also very high  footage of a real professional ballroom dancing competition is seamlessly integrated and the film is infused with great Latin music from beginning to end. And Venessa and Chayanne DO sing one of the songs in the soundtrack all of which sounds terrific in 5.1 surround on the DVD. If you like dance films you owe it to yourself to see DWM.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recall seeing 'Saturday Night Fever' talk about your clichd movie plots! and leaving the theater with nothing but the dancing of John Travolta on my mind. That movie was a huge hit the music was terrific and to my mind it made John Travolta a star.This movie gives me the same feeling. Why was it not a similar hit?I've watched it scores of times. Chayanne and Vanessa Williams have credible chemistry onscreen and the plot although kind of standard is interesting enough to carry the action.In particular I always come back to this movie to watch the dancing. It is simply spectacular. The scene where Chayanne and Vanessa Williams' characters reach a kind of truce because they love to dance and like each other  so they go on a second date  is simply amazing. They arrive at the nightclub where they had a failed first date and the crowd parts to let them in to a kind of Latin musical dance fest where the music doesn't seem to stop long enough for anyone to sit down and catch a breath. They are immediately caught up in the swirl and almost as soon they part and go off in different directions passing each other picking up different partners and having a wonderful time to the fantastic music. The scene is not about them it's about the crowd and the sheer joy of dancing to Latin music  which in this case is not sultry and sensuous onetoone dancing but an allout bacchanalia of multiple partners and a pounding beat. Wonderful wonderful!Everything about this film feels so natural and relaxed. It's like a breath of fresh air. It's not fair to compare it to 'Strictly Ballroom' directed by Baz Luhrmann. I love his movies but I appreciate them for being grand operatic extravaganzas. 'Strictly Ballroom' was certainly that. 'Dance with Me' will always be one of my favorite movies and now I've got a crush on Chayanne that just won't quit.".

There is definite chemistry between them Vanessa and Chayanne. Joan Plowright is one of the dance team married in real life to Laurence Olivier and a remarkable actress so the fact that she chose to be in this movie is a point to note. Kris Kristofferson also gives a fine performance as the long lost father we come to know about. The dancing in the movie is superb there is a lot of dancing...dancing lessons in a dance studio but the storyline progresses well even if you don't like dancing. After watching this you will.

Chayanne has a boyish friendly charm that is immediately disarming. Williams and Kristofferson two actors I've never been particularly fond of turn in great performances and won me over as a new fan. They have splendid screen chemistry with Chayanne and the multiple plots are developed well because of this. The supporting cast have their share of great moments too and provide plenty of comic relief.The wide variety of music and dance styles throughout the movie are utilized well. Look for excellent choreography particularly in the nightclub sequence where Williams gets spun turned and whirled by about a hundred other dancers.

Her acting is drenched with Irene Papas catharsis when she plumbs her soul at the climactic final championship dance she travels through more horizon lines on her emotional interior landscape than Keir Dullea at the end of 2001.  We don't need FX to see those plateaus.  Her face is a gradient seismograph of the turbulent earthquakes transforming her heart. This is an AMAZING performance. To accomplish this in the middle of an athletic dance of Olympic intensity is simply beyond the pale of any other actress on screen today.  No one else could have pulled this off and Williams does it with such absolute authority it's chilling.We have VASTLY underrated the talent of this woman and Hollywood should hang its head in shame for that.Hollywood adapted actress rankings quickly when required to do so in the past.

	onyx:emotionText " Williams performance is the rock which sustains the believability and dramatic tension of DANCE WITH MEs unfolding events.  Her acting is drenched with Irene Papas catharsis when she plumbs her soul at the climactic final championship dance she travels through more horizon lines on her emotional interior landscape than Keir Dullea at the end of 2001.  We don't need FX to see those plateaus.  Her face is a gradient seismograph of the turbulent earthquakes transforming her heart. This is an AMAZING performance. To accomplish this in the middle of an athletic dance of Olympic intensity is simply beyond the pale of any other actress on screen today.  No one else could have pulled this off and Williams does it with such absolute authority it's chilling.We have VASTLY underrated the talent of this woman and Hollywood should hang its head in shame for that.Hollywood adapted actress rankings quickly when required to do so in the past.
