	schema:reviewBody "BLOW  2001  out of fourBy Blake FrenchI don't think George Jung was a corrupt sleazy drug smuggler but more or less a young businessman making money to support his family and wild lifestyle. That is what makes Ted Demme's Blow different from other drug moviesit does not portray its characters as addicted lowlifes but as recklessly successful high powered individuals who simply want to live the American dream. The film is based on the true story of George Jung whose image went from the average Joe next door a highschool football star from a small Massachusetts town to the world's premiere importer of cocaine from Colombia's Medellin cartel who once supplied the States with over 85 of the total amount of imported cocaine in the 1970's and 80's. Blow is one of the best movies of the year.Blow covers a wide range of generations and locations ranging from the turbulent 60's to the haze of the 80's and from such areas of the North America like Massachusetts Florida Colombia California Mexico New York and Illinois. The time and location span provided the filmmakers with a challenge. The film was shot in a variety of locations in Southern California and in Mexico. It was a difficult film to schedule and shoot because it had so many different time periods. And since it was the story of a man's life every scene was fairly brief which meant an incredible number of scenes to be shot explains executive producer Georgia Kacandes.Covering so many years in a single film also tests the ability of the film's costume designers and makeup artists. The wardrobes makeup and hair styles appear authentic and  impressive. This movie pays close attention to even some of the most minute of details. George Jung's motives for pursuing drugs may have been triggered by his family life as a child. His father was a nobody construction worker who often struggled with money and his marriage. In the film Ray Liotta plays George's poor but content father with the versatile Rachel Griffiths as his bitter unhappy mother. George vows to never live his life in poverty no matter what. He moves to California as a young adult where selling marijuana supports his independent lifestyle. Paul Reubens and Ethan Suplee play George's drugdealing comrades. Eventually the authorities send him to prison for a while where he meets Diego Delgado Jordi Molla. An insider in Colombia's rising drug trade this man educates George about the profits of selling cocaine. After serving his time Jung becomes partners with Pablo Escobar Cliff Curtis the billionaire godfather of international cocaine trafficking.Blow displays a consistent and detailed portrait of the spectacular rise and dramatic fall of Jung and his travel towards turning powder cocaine into American's biggest drug problem. Ted Demme's direction is vivid determined and stylish. He reportedly conducted many interviews with the real life George Jung as he makes very clear the early high life and the dangerous reality of a drug smuggler's everyday lifestyle. Demme is careful to stay away from frequent potential distractions like the drug use side characters family issues and romantic interests. This is a vivid narrative of a very interesting character. It does display a message about drugs that we have seen before but never in this stylishly innovative light.Laced with amusing detail and probing awareness Blow defies the usual road of drug movies and provides us with tension and interest from Jung's many experiencesrisky border crossings ferocious consultation unexpected deception the persistence of the authorities and unconquerable temptations. But untimely the film shows the true tragedy of losing your dreams to greed and drugs. Johnny Depp proves once again what a triumphant adaptable actor he can be. He portrays George Jung with the perfect amount of greed style confusion pride and desperation. The real George Jung is in a prison cell in New York. Without possibility of parole Jung's release date is scheduled for 2015. Depp acknowledged the responsibility that comes with dramatizing a true individual but also the responsibility of the director. I knew Ted was committed to the film but I didn't understand how deeply committed he was to the real George.Blow becomes one of the most intriguing movies of 2001 but it even suffers in comparison to the incomprehensible achievement director Darren Aronofsky accomplished last year with his disturbingly real display of the downward spiral of four drug addicts in Requiem for a Dream. That film gave us a cinematic taste of what drug addicts experience through their addictions and depravity. Blow still shines a fresh new light on drugs in movies and perceptively portrays the story of a person from whom many can learn.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since not every film can be a great masterpiece it only stands to reason that there are some which as good as they are will never be mentioned in the same breath as The Godfather. Blow happens to be one of those films. In today's market where films are literally churned out with more attention paid to marketability than merit it is no surprise that films of almost every subject are saturating the market. Even films about or based upon historical crime figures are a dime a dozen these days. The plus to this is that the ones that do come out have to do something special in order to be considered good.Blow's strengths lie in a couple of performances and the scenes in which George Jung's ability to negotiate his way out of a fix or into one are displayed. Johnny Depp plays Jung with a consummate authenticity that especially when sees the interviews with the real George Jung literally leaps out of the screen. It's hard to believe this guy who I saw as a freshfaced seminerd in A Nightmare On Elm Street is able to portray such a wide and varied range of characters. Ray Liotta gives him ample support as Fred Jung showing a man hit hard by his own unsuccessful attempts to keep himself independent and free therefore fully understanding of how far his son will go to see he doesn't fail in the same endeavour. The final scene with Liotta where he is listening to the tape recording is one of the most touching examples of men declaring they cannot regret their defiance seen on film.The scenes with Pablo Escobar are especially amusing. As we see how George was able to charm his way into any deal he set his mind to one cannot help but admire the man. Merely standing before the most powerful drug lord in South America at that time would have taken more guts than most people are allotted. The Jungian method of keeping oneself calm while smuggling through customs even if completely fictional sums up this this calmness in the face of danger quite brilliantly.But and it seems there always is a but with Hollywood product these days some aspects of the film are terrible. Penlope Cruz is absolutely horrible as Mirtha Jung and it is hard to believe that someone as cocky and bold as George would tolerate her presence. I've heard Salma Hayek or horsejaw as she is probably betterknown suggested for the part but she is just as bad. Given how many actresses there are in Spain who would appreciate a break and know a mode of speech other than screaming one can't help but wish the director could have shown a bit of Jungian testicular fortitude and cast an unknown.Adding to the film's woes is the end of the story. Compared to the first two thirds where we seem to be going along at the speed of one of Jung's sports cars the whole thread about Jung's inability to live without contact with his daughter brings affairs to a screeching halt. That Christina Jung has never visited her father at least according to the ending crawl is a pretty sad fact. What's even worse is that after viewing this film we never learn anything about Christina. We don't learn if the cocaine abuse on her mother's part during pregnancy had any ill effects or whether she has led a life she would call satisfactory. She is little more than a prop. The fact that Jaime King the actress who played her during the final wrapup is a recovering heroin addict only makes one wonder more. Especially among those of us who really have to live with permanent physical damage that may have been caused by parental drug abuse during in utero development even if it was only nicotine in my mother's case.In all I gave Blow an eight out of ten. If you want to know anything about George Jung and how cocaine got to be such a hot item in America then this film does make some excellent points. With the poor economy in America where bluecollar workers are in borderline poverty while CEOs rip them off something blind it really is a wonder we aren't seeing the rise of an army composed of George Jung wannabes.".

	schema:reviewBody "The effects of lacking the fortitude and conscience to make the right choices in life are examined in Blow' directed by Ted Demme and starring Johnny Depp as George Jung a young New Englander who decides early on that living week to week and barely being able to make ends meet is not the kind of life he wants.  George grew up in the 50s in a decent middleclass family but was deeply affected by the fact that his father Fred Ray Liotta worked his fingers to the bone as a plumber sometimes fourteen hours a day seven days a week and it was never enough especially for his mother Ermine Rachel Griffiths who complained endlessly about not having enough money.  More than once she abandoned her family only to be taken back every time upon her return by Fred who adored her.  Then in the late 60s George along with his childhood friend Tuna Ethan Suplee moved to Southern California and quickly discovered the freedom of the beaches and a lifestyle conducive to his idea of paradise.  That paradise' being anchored in the realization of the big easy money to be made at the time selling marijuana and for George it was only the beginning the onramp to the freeway that would ultimately take him to the top of his profession' and which was destined to define his life.  It's a tale as old as time the lesson of which is destined forever unfortunately to be ignored by those who seek the quick and easy road to wealth and happiness.  Courage it has been said has many faces one kind earns soldiers and citizens medals for rising above imminent danger. Another can be defined as being able to decline the carrot of illgotten gains when it is dangled before you.  George lacked that kind of courage and instead grabbed the promise it proffered with both hands only to discover too late that it was empty indeed and laced with unhappiness. It's a classic ragstorichestooblivion story with a moral that will be embraced by those with the wisdom to build their house of brick instead of sticks and straw.As George Depp turns in a convincing believable performance portraying him as a misguided rather than bad' person.  You sense that George's naivete enabled him to take chances and enter an arena to which common sense would otherwise have dictated avoidance and because of that you are able to sympathize somewhat with him.  Depp lends an innocence to the character in which you can find the kid next door the good kid you grew up with and knew throughout your school years and in retrospect it would seem that George a reasonably intelligent young man simply made some very stupid decisions. And as they say the prisons are full of those just like him.  But the most telling indication of who George really is and what he couldshould have been comes through his relationship with his father.  And it is that which becomes the very core of the story.As Fred Jung Ray Liotta gives a poignant performance presenting a very real person in a very real setting.  completely avoiding any kind of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen Liotta plays him with a depth that averts  sentimentality and makes the unconditional love he shows for his son entirely believable.  It's a direct and understated performance that so clearly defines the true character of the man and it is in the scenes between Liotta and Depp that the true nature of George is revealed as well in which you begin to understand that he was just an ordinary guy who got caught up in extraordinary circumstances of his own design.The supporting cast includes Penelope Cruz Mirtha Franka Potente Barbara Paul Reubens Derek Foreal Jordi Molla Diego Cliff Curtis Escobar and Max Perlich Dulli.  A cautionary tale for those who allow themselves to stray from the straight and narrow the real impact of Blow' is ultimately contained in the final frame of the film.  It is a still picture of the real George Jung and to fully realize what his life has been about you need look no further than into the eyes of the man in that photograph.  I rate this one 810.".

A cautionary tale for those who allow themselves to stray from the straight and narrow the real impact of Blow' is ultimately contained in the final frame of the film.  It is a still picture of the real George Jung and to fully realize what his life has been about you need look no further than into the eyes of the man in that photograph.  I rate this one 810.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand why many people I talked to either thought the film was bad or mediocre.  Sure it isn't a great movie but when was the last time you saw 5 great movies in a row?  A great movie comes along once in a blue moon depending on your definition of great.  I personally was very engaged in the plot.  Johnny Depp gives a tourdeforce performance fully engaging himself in the character.  I'm sure he did lots of research on George Jung and tried to mimick his every mannerism because this was far from a halfbaked effort.  Then again I don't ever recall Johnny Depp doing a movie where he didn't put his full enthusiasm into the role.  The movie has many tragic moments and many funny moments.  The film is a little over 2 hours long but the time flew by in a breeze.  I was so enlightened that I'm anxious to do some research on the real George Jung.  I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz and they could've chosen a much better actress but she's only in the film about 20 or 30 minutes so she isn't given enough time to ruin the film.  Paul Reubens gives a surprisingly earnest performance as a flamboyant bisexual hairdresser.  It's too bad he's caught up in all this controversy because he seems to have sufficient range as an actor.  I loved hearing all the great classic rock songs in the soundtrack and every time I watch the film the songs get stuck in my head and I start singing them for days on end.  Blow is a touching drama that doesn't try to exploit the world of drugs nor condemn it.  After seeing George's tragic outcomes as a worldclass coke dealer I doubt anyone would want to get in or get back into the business but that doesn't necessarily mean the message is preachy. My score  8 out of 10".

The fact that it was based on a true story?At any rate back to the film which is wonderfully shot backed up by great performances from Johnny Depp Ray Liotta and Jordi Molla. The film is told from a narrative perspective by George Jung Johnny Depp tracing the spectacular rise and fall of the pioneering US cocaine distributor of the 70  80s.The film moves seamlessly from George's adolescence to adulthood through a number of locations and vividly captures the essence of that decadent era. The sets costumes and music all work perfectly.The audience takes an incredible journey pulled into a world of drug smuggling  distributing the illusion of 'easy money' ensuing greed and finally betrayal. While many are quick to point out the fact that this person was a drug dealer and ponder why feel sorry for him? this misses the point IMO. His story doesn't search for sympathy from the audience although it is a sad one. It is an unapologetic look at an unapologetic life.The greatest takeaway from his experience was that he realized too late what was truly important in his life. Simple things not the money not the cars but real things as foreshadowed by his father's speech to him as a child. A point that is continually being underscored by his father's unconditional love wonderfully played by Ray Liotta a refreshing character change for him and culminates in his own unconditional love for his daughter  although he is too late to recieve it. minor spoilers ahead Notable scenes in the movie includeThe beginning of the US cocaine explosion after meeting Pablo  the stylish kaleidoscopic montage of single shot images brilliantly captures the essence of that era underscored by the song Blinded by the Light in the backgroundJolla's solid performance as the twofaced 'Judas' Diego is highlighted in the powerful cokeinduced scene where admits his betrayal to George.Johnny Depp is tremendous as usual. His understated performances are growing on me with every picture. This contrasts harshly with Penelope Cruz's performances which I have found to be increasingly annoying with each performance.Lastly the sad irony of this film is that it is also now a selftribute to a rising film maker who could not himself escape the dangers of cocaine.Ted Demme RIP.".

The scene where George has to carry a suitcase containing fifty kilos of cocaine through customs is both good crafts work and very exciting to watch.Watching the film today however I must say I didn't find the George Jung character very plausible. To me it seems like the entire purpose of the film is to whitewash George Jung and make him and the dope trade into something it obviously isn't.George Jung was a high level player in the organization known as the Medellin cartel run by drug lord Pablo Escobar. This was the organization which among other horrible acts including countless murders singlehandedly declared war on the Colombian state and put Colombian society through several years of fear and arbitrary terror making Meddelin and Bogota into two of the most dangerous cities in the world to live in. Yet we are led to believe that George Jung wasn't like this. He never turns to violence. It's not George that's bad it's everyone around else except for his father and the murderous Pablo Escobar.It's astonishing how many alterations are made to the real story in order to whitewash George.When he skips bail the first time in the film it's because of his wife's illness when in reality he was motivated by pure egoism.When he makes the arrangements for the first cocaine flight it's this evil Colombian guy who demands of the pilot information on his family implicitly threatening to murder them if something should happen to the narcotics while this was in fact George's own preferred method of securing his goods.Not to mention the mild reaction he gets to Diego's treachery. He merely travels to Normans Cay in order to show his contempt for the guy. George never intends to hurt anyone. Wrong. The only reason why George called of his plans to kill Diego or Carlos which was his actual name was out of fear of an all out war with the Medellin cartel. To them Carlos was much more important than George.I know it's only fiction and by the use of voiceover it is made clear that this is in fact George's own subjective account of what went down. To me though that just isn't enough. I think the film would have profited of a more complex character. The whitewash of George is not essential to the plot.My question then is why doesn't the director create a darker character as would have been perfectly called for in this film? What are his motives? Why the need to whitewash? One is almost led to think that this was George Jung's own making. But it couldn't be could it...?".

The whitewash of George is not essential to the plot.My question then is why doesn't the director create a darker character as would have been perfectly called for in this film? What are his motives? Why the need to whitewash? One is almost led to think that this was George Jung's own making. But it couldn't be could it...?";

	schema:reviewBody "Blow is always watchable and it's often very entertaining  well acted. However I also found it extremely trite and shallow. This movie wants to be Goodfellas or even Casino an unfairly maligned film and will inevitably be compared with those films. But it falls well short and comes across like Scorseselite at best and at worst as reductive and predictable as a TV movie. Blow's timing is especially unfortunate since we just got a trenchant comprehensive view of the drug world from Traffic  and Blow pales in comparison.The first and perhaps most fatal flaw is how broad the strokes that the screenwriters David McKenna  Nick Cassavetes and director Ted Demme make  they tend to settle for boiler plate scenes. The film depicts the rise and fall of a drug dealer  and you could probably plot out every scene right now without even seeing the film. Here's the scene where he meets his first beautiful girlfriend. Here's the scene where they make their first score. Here's where they get high  live it up. Here's where they get busted. Etc.etc. etc. Characters pop in and out and things happen without much explanation or development. I never really felt like I got to know any one or emotionally attach myself. Perhaps this is a result of choppy editing but I felt that the script and direction tended to go for the obvious or the obviously gritty. The cast consists of some of the most interesting actors from around the world including Max Perlich and Run Lola Run's Franka Potente  wasted in a throwaway role but the movie doesn't give them much to do or bother to dig deeper into their psyches. Paul Reubens aka PeeWee Herman manages to give a winking fey performance as a hairdresser cum drug dealer but he's one of the few actors that actually registers a presence aside from Depp. Both Rachel Griffiths and Penelope Cruz are wasted in caricatures The women in the film consist mostly of strident caricatures  screaming harridans and crazy coked out bitches. While Depp is always magnetic to watch and does a remarkable job with the physical transformation of his character through time though his Boston accent is erratic and he has a tendency to appear too much like a rock star in his recent roles  remember Chocolat?  I'm still trying to forget his characterization ultimately disappoints by remaining remote. George Jung remains a cipher for us. I wish he'd return to the maturity and subtle depth of his performance in Donnie Brasco which remains his best and perhaps most adult performance  free of gimmicks and quirks. We get crude attempts to draw lines between Jung's early family life and his later domestic life with his wife and child. My next complaint is that I didn't learn a damn thing from this movie. I was hoping to gain insight into the details of cocaine production distribution  sales or find out about what made George Jung or Pablo Escobar tick. We only get a rough sketch of Escobar etched with sly savage economy by the great Kiwi actor Cliff Curtis  when will someone give him a movie of his own? from a distance  Jung remains a remote albeit charming blank. We never meet the customers the users of cocaine we don't even really see deals being made in any great detail. We don't see anything we haven't seen before and I walked away unenlightened and unedified. Last there's the matter of style. The movie suffers a lack of tonal consistency Is it a realistic docudrama? Subjective firstperson account? A blend of the two? Campy social satire? Tragedy? and worse from a lack of a coherent style. Goodfellas was always filtered through Henry Hill's eyes  and went even further by being filtered through Scorsese's view of Hill and his world  giving it an extra subtle layer irony to the amoral proceedings.Demme and his DP Ellen Kuras change stock exposure camera angles  employ freezeframes and stylish lighting flourishes with reckless abandon. I'm all for stylistic adventurousness and experimentation. But there has to be a moral or aesthetic justification for each flourish otherwise it becomes arbitrary MTV gobbledygook. When Scorsese uses these tricks they're used with tremendous skill and precision. Each effect is designed to underline a specific character emotion piece of information or theme. Or perhaps he wants the audience to share the emotions of his character at that particular moment. Demme's style is more wilynily.I learned far more about the rise and fall of a sinner  criminal pathology from Goodfellas. Soderbergh's Traffic gave me more insight into the international world of drug trafficking  moved with more with the intractable complexity of Benicio Del Toro's character. Blow just passed the time somewhat uneasily. It bums me out to dislike this film since I was gunning for it  we really need a great film to watch. But this isn't it.".

Its plot is rambling bloated and tediously predictable  so many plot points are crammed into it. This poorly constructed narrative results with sorely limited characterisation. Some seemingly important characters come and go within ten minutes it's a total mess. Much of the film is one long dreary drug deal only the most immature viewer would be engaged or even worse allured by it. Most people will watch it thinking about how it lacks the energy sophistication and talent of all the fantastic crime films it so crudely rips off. Few films are as annoyingly kitsch as this. Johnny Depp again proves his lack of credibility in the crime genre his first attempt being in the similarly dull 'Donnie Brasco'. I'm not sure why some deem his performance 'excellent' his feminine features and lack of charisma just don't work in the genre. Ray Liotta plays Depp's father the noble working class stock character that forms the film's rather flimsy antidrug message. This fails because of the aforementioned narrative issues the film is utterly devoid of any message that properly resonates with the viewer because it is all so hackneyed and clichd. Most people who like this film appear to foolishly do so because they find it 'cool' much like the bonehead rappers who idolise Tony Montana in 'Scarface'. To make matters worse the film also has mawkish lashings of sentimentalism towards the end. The crew had to have known how inferior this film was during production I can imagine it was exhausting for them to complete the project with any conviction.www.hawkensian.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to like Blow a lot more than I did as I am a major devotee of the riseandfall drug movie subgenre.  However despite another effortlessly excellent performance from Johnny Depp this film fails to add up to more than the sum of its parts.The story told here spans decades and chronicles the familiar story of the dizzying rise within the drug trade the opulent excess the unheeded warning signs of violence and loss and the final fall resulting in emotional devastation.  Individual moments in the film are affecting especially in the last third when Depp's character attempts to go straight and win back his daughter. These scenes reveal a side to this ofttold story that are not always evident in other films.  But unfortunately the structure of the film is a mess and the timing is all off.  Somehow I felt myself longing to see more depth of character for the writers and directors to spend more time with each scene while at the same time feeling boredom and restlessness due to my inability to become fully engaged by each new scene or characterthe story being told is big and long and the filmmakers clearly do not have a real handle on it.Lack of focus and a clear sense of direction are the film's greatest flaws and these overshadow more favorable elements including a fresh visual take on the partytime 70s setting  This film eschews the glossy disco sheen of so many of the recent films about this era with a dingy sunbaked vision.  Glamour is noticeably missing from Blow a fact that I both admire and find refreshing.Other bright moments include a subtly hilarious cameo from Bobcat Goldthwaite as well as other strong supporting performances and a calm unhurried and believable portrayal of the relationship between Depp and his father played by the alwaysdependable Ray Liotta.  However the performance by Penelope Cruz is unbelievably shrill manic and offputting.  She comes off as a deranged harpie a onedimensional coke fiend. I wonder if there was far more meat to Cruz's performance before director Ted Demme began editing heavily to keep the film under 3 hours.  Cruz's work has been promising so far so I wonder if she is solely to blame for a truly awful performance.A sign of a film that misses the mark in a fundamental way is its ability to constantly remind you of similar but far better films. Blow does this and it only makes clear how unsuccessful the film is.  This film owes a debt to GoodFellas and Boogie Nights as well as a number of other films but suffers greatly by comparison.  It lacks the vitality originality and skill of Traffic and the existence of these inevitable comparisons only makes it clearer that Blow is bluntly put together deeply flawed and an uninteresting take on an important and fascinating topic.".

And along comes Depp. The dynamics of the character are that he engenders trust with the people he contacts.Well known social phenomenon when you take drugs with someone an intimate opportunistic fellowship is created not from any commonality but by shared exclusion of the outside' in spite of the best attempts of that outside to intrude. Get enough druggies walking around and you have a bazillion pairs of immediate mostly superficial conspiracies adding up to a counterculture. This film focuses not on the counterculture but the pairs formed by Depp's character and the people he meets. As he says he is very very good at this.Depp is coming along as a fine actor. He's no Sean Penn yet but he is one of a half dozen male actors worth following and he is steadily growing. His solution to the challenge of this film is to adopt an acting style that is a conspiracy of pairs. He completely ignores Demme who seems concerned with his checklist of directors to copy. Instead what we see is a two layered performance between Depp and each of his collaborating actors.At the low' level we see Jung forming a bond. At the higher level we see Depp forming similar bonds to create the illusion of the first. It's intelligent stuff which he shades according to each role. For instance with Rubens there are sexual bounds that are excluded but because they are explicitly so they become important at the higher level. The partnership with Liotta is notable liotta is the senior but less talented so he withdraws. Depp goes extra distance in this conspiracy to help Liotta define the character of the Dad.Particularly of interest is what Depp works out with the two women again all behind Demme's back. Potente is an intelligent actress who was in Lola' a landmark bit of folded selfreference. His bond with her is intellectual. See the virtual winks and nudges. If she had lived he would have had a chance at turning his life into something meaningful and with Depp controlling the movie to have a more meaningful existence.Cruz is not an intelligent actress rather an intuitive. See how Depp forms an improv bond with her at the actor level that mirrors the story? Mostly acting with their body movements? And on and on one at a time Depp creates a counterculture of performances. Stay tuned to Depp.".

There are too many plays for sympathy a certain neatness in the way events always seem to absolve the criminal of blame a sense of something being laid on a little too thick. So it is with 'Blow'.George Jung as played by Johnny Depp is a perpetual ingenue. His character is a catalogue of good looks and sweet gestures and he has a downright saintliness in his dealings with others that's so slick and saccharine that one can see the con coming from miles away. George is kind to his friends generous to his business partners oddly enough always the victim and never the perpetrator of double crossings and by God he loves his daughter. I was disappointed that there were no scenes of Johnny Depp administering aid to wounded animals but it's possible that these were cut to allow the film to run its current six hours in length.While there's a certain low humour in watching filmmakers unknowingly playing the role of patsies the warped and jagged caricatures Jung's narrative makes of the other people in his story the better to portray him as Christ soon nip any fun in the bud. George's mother Rachel Griffiths utterly wasted is a cold insatiate bitch his wife Penelope Cruz hysterical is a cokemad tantrum throwing ingrate and his West Coast distributor Paul Reubens the less said the better is a limp wristed fairy largely I suspect so as not to threaten George's position as the film's only sympathetic attractive nonethnic heterosexual male. It's notable that the only female close to Jung who gets anything like a good rap is his flowerchild stewardess fiancee Barbara who rather conveniently drops dead before her relations with him have a chance to sour.While it's not exactly unentertaining  the film's earlymid section works well as an evocation of sunlit good times  'Blow's' inherent manipulativeness is never far beneath the surface. Once things go bad for Jung the film starts to sag in sympathy literally with him and becomes instead a chronicle of Bad and Unjust Things Suffered with Commendable Stoicism by George Jung. My advice would be to have already left the theatre by this point. The ending is painfully overblown and drawn out and we are forced to endure one of the more 'off' moments in recent cinema as the film primly castigates Jung's daughter for not visiting her father in jail. I'm sure she has her reasons.".

Instead of seeing the real George Jung as a man who just wanted to have a normal life but didn't know how to do anything else but smuggle drugs we are just treated to Depp not even aging well but just going through several decades with a bad haircut.Other characters enter his life but we never get to know them.  Some seem more of a distraction like making his first love die of cancer or they end up disappearing through half the film like George's gay hairdressing contact to Hollywood played by Paul Reubens of PeeWee Herman fame.  Simply Jung goes and deals drugs then he tries more gets caught tries again gets caught friends come friends go.  We all know from the beginning of the film that it won't work for George in the end but the wait to get there is a romp through many uninteresting scenes and characters which just didn't hold my interest.The only time the movie seems successful is the interaction George Jung has with his Mother and Father which are played greatly by Ray Liota and Rachel Griffiths but they only amount to small parts in the film.In the end they throw on a soundtrack reminiscent of the era and try to glitz up a couple shots but the movie just doesn't have enough interesting characters memorable scenes or dialogue and goes on for far to long. There have been better films on the subject matter which are more interesting have memorable characters and scenes such as GoodFellas and Scarface and perhaps that's the problem.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this adaptation of Bruce Porter's novel Blow having read most of the book. As a film alone it is passable. But as an adaptation of truly attentiongetting material it is a sorry failure. Based on the truelife of George Jung who created an empire in the United States by dealing cocaine the film starts off on the wrong footing and continues to descend into a whitewash of the events of George Jung's life.Director Ted Demme takes Jung's life and creates artificial sympathy for the character making the film a tragedy of circumstance rather than of choice. However George Jung himself admitted that the only reason he chose to be a cocaine dealer was that times were slow and he needed the money. Demme also turns Jung's mother into an uncaring villain who turns her son into the cops and taunts him as he is led away when in reality Jung really doesn't know who turned him in. The film also looks over the fact that George had a wellpaying job when he decided to enter the world of drug trafficking. It is of no surprise that director Ted Demme sympathized with Jung considering Demme's own cocaine related death less than a year later.What was advertised and initially appeared to be a truly engaging exploration of the world of cocaine dealing turned out to be a very typical Hollywood film about drug dealing. With music video cinematography and underwhelming performances by Johnny Depp Penelope Cruz and most of the remaining cast Blow doesn't come close to expanding or improving upon countless other films exploring the same topic. It falls quickly into the Hollywood glamor trap and never ascends to anything more than typical.".

	schema:reviewBody "Edelweisspiraten or The Edelweiss Pirates is a coproduction between four different countries one of them being Germany and the result is that this film is mostly in the German language. The version I saw ran for 96 minutes including credits but I see there is also another version out there that is roughly 15 minutes longer. The director and also one of the writers is Niko von Glasow and it is probably even more than a fairly prolific decade after this one was made back in 2004 his most known work. Does it have to do with the cast? Not really I guess. Jochen Nickel Anna Thalbach and Bela B. Felsenheimer are all no unknown actors but also nowhere near the elite of German film performers. As for Bela B. he is still much more known for his performances with German punk rock band Die rzte even if his acting career is also more prolific than most may think. And with Anna Thalbach I am not only amazed how much she resembles Katharina like identical twins in different decades but also that she somewhat nicely pulled off the female lead here as well as in looking both desirable and stunning but also in terms of looking like a political victim of her time.And this of course refers to the Nazi years because this is when the film is set and the Edelweisspiraten are a resistance group that did in fact exist for several years even if hardly anybody outside the historian profession knows about them today. And maybe one reason is that the attention they received for example with this movie is not on a level that depicts them as memorable to those interested theatre audiences in this specific case. Sadly the two brother characters never really attracted my attention and I found them relatively weak and interchangeable. Bela B. was slightly better but given the material and potential to his character he was also underwhelming. Thalback was okay like I wrote earlier. The Nazi actors did not make a difference either. I believe that with a subject like this resistance and suffering in 1940s Germany films need to come up with something special something that stands out because there are hundreds of films on this subject and if you really want audiences to care then you need to make a difference compared to all these other films. This film here does not and so it sinks in the gray matter of the genre I just mentioned. Even worse the horrortortureviolence scenes towards the very end make it look like a desperate attempt to achieve this previously mentioned difference but it never feels creative just for the sake of it. Like I wrote in the title of my review this is quite a shame as these Edelweipiraten sure deserved a film that accurately and convincingly elaborates on their existence. I hope they get one in the future. This one is not it. Watch something else instead.".

While Harry Kumel's film is one of the most aesthetically beautiful vampire pictures ever lensed dripping with subtle sexual tension it also presses forth with a feministlesbian subtext that's as alluring as it is clever. The plot is relatively straightforward and the film takes its time in establishing mood and atmosphereValerie Danielle Ouiment and Stefan John Karlen are newlyweds who are on the rocks only 3 hours into the marriage and things are complicated further when Countess Bathory and her assistant Ilona Andrea Rau check into the same deserted seaside hotel. While the atmosphere could be compared to the Universal and Hammer horrors Kumel's artistrywith wellframed images emphasis on wardrobe and a very deliberate color schemeexists in its own unique league. The topic of lesbianismand even heterosexualityis presented in a minimalist unexploitative manner yet maintains a pervasive eroticism throughout. Even the vampiric seduction is presented with a minimum of graphic bloodshed which is all the more effective. Daughters of Darkness is the type of moody characterdriven piece that plays like a sensual sister to George Romero's similarly unique Martin. As my comment title implies this is an excellent film required viewing for fans of horror and great art alike.".

While Harry Kumel's film is one of the most aesthetically beautiful vampire pictures ever lensed dripping with subtle sexual tension it also presses forth with a feministlesbian subtext that's as alluring as it is clever. The plot is relatively straightforward and the film takes its time in establishing mood and atmosphereValerie Danielle Ouiment and Stefan John Karlen are newlyweds who are on the rocks only 3 hours into the marriage and things are complicated further when Countess Bathory and her assistant Ilona Andrea Rau check into the same deserted seaside hotel. While the atmosphere could be compared to the Universal and Hammer horrors Kumel's artistrywith wellframed images emphasis on wardrobe and a very deliberate color schemeexists in its own unique league. The topic of lesbianismand even heterosexualityis presented in a minimalist unexploitative manner yet maintains a pervasive eroticism throughout. Even the vampiric seduction is presented with a minimum of graphic bloodshed which is all the more effective. Daughters of Darkness is the type of moody characterdriven piece that plays like a sensual sister to George Romero's similarly unique Martin. As my comment title implies this is an excellent film required viewing for fans of horror and great art alike.";

	schema:reviewBody "Stay with this film it is incredible. Great acting cinematography direction. The lead actress isn't great but the actress who plays Erzebet Bathory is phenomenal. Bizaar sets and strange milieu really add to this film's strange portrayal of vampires and how they deal with the living. I really loved this film. Of course today everything happens at the speed of light. Back in 1970 they took their time with building the film and really letting it sink in before hitting you with the shocks. This one has plenty of shocking moments and some really great inventive scenes that add to the history of the vampire film. Unfortunately today we now have 'Twilight' a disgusting parody of the genre that hopefully audiences will someday say 'What the hell were we thinking?'.".

	schema:headline " psychosexual fever dream";
	schema:reviewBody "I was fortunate enough to unwind last night with Harry Kumel's erotic and Stygian Daughters of Darkness Les Lvres Rouges. It is a tasteful vampire movie an oxymoron?. Let me start by saying that the art direction is astonishing. If ever a building was elevated to the status of a character it would be the offseason and deserted Grand Hotel des Thermes in Ostend where the majority of the film is set. Its de Chiricoesqe arcades and columns shot in their full crepuscular splendour separate the action from the real world enveloping the players in a metaphysical demimonde. One senses from the beginning the film's perversity everything is set in Melvillean twilights and dusks somewhere ephemeral between or beyond good and evil. The travelling couple of the vampire movie the man generally virtuous and upstanding the woman meek and ingenue in this case are replaced by a fractured and sensual pair. He announces on the nighttrain to Ostend I don't love you which she parrots back and they decide that this means that they are perfectly matched. The soundtrack is perfectly atmospheric subNyman and the sense of colour is almost unmatched in film history. Twilight exterior shots in the mode of Whistler are interposed with glowing yellow interiors. The exquisite monochrome costumes perfectly match the psychosexual themes. Particularly memorable is Delphine Seyrig in a flowing scarlet dress sipping a turquoise cocktail from a martini glass. Whilst this is a perfectly cast movie one would have to say that Delphine Seyrig as the countess Elizabeth Bathory runs away with the show in a screenstealing performance. The sensuality of her voice is reminiscent of fever dreams and the subtlety of her expression turns what could have been in the wrong hands a porno flick into a Schnitzlerian psychosexual drama par excellence. There were a few false notes some ludicrous Hammerinspired shots towards the end plus a less than satisfying codicil whose raison d'etre seems to be a false belief in the relevance of the plot. But all of this can be sorted with judicious editing and doesn't really detract from the general tone of the movie. Watch this but beware it is a truly adult fairytale and an explicit exploration of sadomasochism.".

	schema:headline " DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS Harry Kumel 1971 12  SPOILERS";
	schema:reviewBody "I had wanted to watch this cult classic for ages and I finally managed to do so via Blue Underground's SE DVD reissue. Although I had been tempted by the previous SE DVD edition from Anchor Bay I reasoned that since it was one of their earliest discs they'd eventually reissue it somewhere down the line in an improved edition which they didin a way! Actually I had originally planned to get this in August along with that batch of horror film DVDs from MGM and Warner but I literally couldn't wait until then!Even though I was expecting to like DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS I must say that by the end of it I absolutely loved the film. To me it's a nearperfect masterpiece. I can think of only a handful of films in the horror genre which come anywhere close to its accomplished artistry and sophistication. That may be because the film's director did not treat it as a horror film in the first place and he still doesn't consider it as one but instead supplied it with a distinctly personal and uniquely 'arty' look where the color red is predominant.The film's very opening sequence is an unusual and boldly erotic one a passionate sexual encounter between our two protagonists the newlywed couple Stefan John Karlen and Valerie Danielle Ouimet the only other film I know of which starts in this way is the Donald CammellNicolas Roeg collaboration PERFORMANCE 1970. Rather than coming off as an exploitative scene it serves the purpose of illustrating the unity and bliss the couple experience during their lovemaking feelings which are immediately seen to be illusory and tenuous at best shattered by a tangible tension rising out of Stefan's resolute and irrational reluctance to introduce his wife to his aristocratic 'family' in London. In fact although he is ostensibly the film's 'hero' as the narrative progresses the audience is all but alienated by the increasingly disquieting pieces of information which we come to learn about Stefan his violent moodswings his morbid and possibly necrophiliac fascination with death his ambiguous sexual identity etc. In an early and disturbing sequence which prepares us somewhat for the later shocking belting scene while sightseeing in the city of Bruges Stefan becomes so fascinated by the sight of a dead girl apparently the Countess' victim that he unconsciously perhaps violently hits Valerie who is trying to hold him back on the face. Afterwards on their journey back at night by bus they try to make up again but the only way they can communicate is by having Valerie almost unbuttoning his fly! His mind is still on the dead girl however and he brushes Valerie's hand aside. It is interesting to note that Kumel had originally wanted Malcolm McDowell for the role of Stefan  after seeing him in Lindsay Anderson's IF.1968. However in Kumel's own sarcastic words 'when he McDowell saw the script he threw it back at me  he thought it was disgusting! Afterwards he went to make CALIGULA 1979!' Despite this as it turned out John Karlen star of the DARK SHADOWS TV series and subsequent movies was a very adequate replacement.As for Valerie Kumel was looking for something of a Sarah Bernhardt figure 'like a lily on the verge of exhaustion'. However he complained that 'she Ouimet was far too healthy for the part.' Although she is certainly a beautiful woman and at times captures the wounded frailty and vulnerability of her character admirably on the whole she comes out as rather stiff resulting in a wooden performance especially towards the end when her submission to the Countess' will is complete. In this regard the coda of the film where she is seen wearing a cape and seducing two new I daresay unattractive victims suggesting that the story will repeat itself is unconvincing and seems tackedon in fact I found it to be the one undeniable false note struck by the film during its entire runningtime although as Kumel explains in the Commentary the epilogue was needed so as to show that evil was not destroyed with the Countess' death but was to live on through her lover.The film's sparse austere settings particularly the Hotel Astoria is reminiscent of Alain Resnais' impenetrable arthouse classic LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD 1961 and fit the dreamlike mood and deliberate pace of the film perfectly. Perhaps that is why Kumel wanted Delphine Seyrig star of MARIENBAD from the outset for the role of the infamous Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory. Her iconic performance complete with an intoxicating smile which would melt ice is simply magnificent and she looks stunning in those gorgeous outfits she is made to wear throughout the film. A prude may have misgivings about the depiction of the sexual attraction existing between Bathory and Valerie but given the undeniable sensuality and the unexpected sensitivity which puts contemporary lesbian vampire pictures to shame with which it is portrayed it is inevitable and utterly credible that Valerie would eventually leave Stefan for Bathory. Since the film was shot at the start of the Seventies and the character of the Countess is said to have stayed at that same hotel some forty years before i.e. the early Thirties Kumel's modeling of Seyrig's interpretation of Bathory after Marlene Dietrich as she appeared in Josef von Sternberg's films is no mere homage by a film historian turned director which Kumel actually was but also an accurate rendering of the acting styles and social mores of the period. It's gratifying to learn that both Alain Resnais and Delphine Seyrig  who had already appeared in such notable films as Resnais' MURIEL 1963 Joseph Losey's ACCIDENT 1967 Francois Truffaut's STOLEN KISSES 1968 which incidentally I also purchased along with DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS and Luis Bunuel's THE MILKY WAY 1969  considered this to be her best work. It's a pity therefore that her work after DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS is so hard to track down nowadays with Bunuel's THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE 1972 and Fred Zinnemann's THE DAY OF THE JACKAL 1973 being the bestknown although one would think that she was always worth watching.If Delphine Seyrig referenced Marlene Dietrich the shortcropped hairdo sported by Andrea Rau playing Bathory's longsuffering secretarylover Ilona makes one think intentionally so of Louise Brooks as she appeared in G.W. Pabst's PANDORA'S BOX 1928 and DIARY OF A LOST GIRL 1929. Whilst not an actress in Seyrig's class Rau possesses an intensely captivating and physical presence or as Harry Kumel himself puts it 'Andrea was a natural she had no inhibitions maybe because she had done porno.' Kumel downplays all vampiric lore in his film so that the fleeting moments in which they appear like Bathory casting no reflection in the mirror take you by surprise. This is most evident when Stefan entreats and then playfully if a little too forcibly pulls Ilona into the shower with him. Her horror at being splashed with running water causes her to slip fall and impale herself on an upright razorblade! Farfetched perhaps but undeniably effective. Two other actors appearing in the film worth mentioning are Georges Jamin and Fons Rademakers. Jamin playing the hapless and enigmatic retired Detective with his long overcoat and apparently on the Countess' trail reminds me of Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot character his unexpected and blackly comedic 'death' scene at the hands of the Countess is reminiscent of a similar scene in that which I consider to be JeanLuc Godard's masterpiece WEEKEND 1967  and which I unconsciously paid homage to in my first and still unproduced screenplay! The idea of having Fons Rademakers playing Stefan's 'mother' was an ingenious one adding just the right touch of eccentricity and ambiguity to the proceedings revealing a hitherto unknown side to Stefan's sexual identity and going some way in explaining his reticence towards discussing his 'mother' with Valerie and his eventual violent outbursts towards her when the latter keeps forcing the issue. This could have easily been a ludicrous and unintentionally hilarious revelation but Rademakers' understated performance devoid of clichd camp attributes makes it work. Of course I knew about this 'twist' before watching the movie but I can imagine how this must have baffled the clueless contemporary audiences  rather akin to finding out that Isabelle Adjani had been humping a tentacled alien in a dilapidated apartment in Andrzej Zulawski's delirious POSSESSION 1981! Fons Rademakers who had been a former assistant to Jean Renoir Vittorio De Sica and Charles Crichton was a notable film director himself with the OscarWinning THE ASSAULT 1986 being his most famous work.While the film is usually pigeonholed with the other lesbian vampire movies prevalent at the time  THE VAMPIRE LOVERS 1970 COUNTESS Dracula 1972 VAMPYRES 1974 etc.  DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS is so much more than that. Frankly it may very well end up disappointing both horror and adult film buffs due to the artistic as opposed to exploitative deployment of bloodletting and nudity in the film. As a matter of fact the film also has three very improbable but remarkable death scenes which in Ilona's case include an homage to the shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO 1960 a blasphemous allusion to Christ on the Cross in Stefan's and possibly Joan Of Arc in Elizabeth's! Even so I have all the three movies I mentioned earlier on preorder at the moment and am looking forward to watching the last two for the first time particularly COUNTESS Dracula which is a cruder retelling of Elizabeth Bathory's exploits with Ingrid Pitt and LesleyAnn Down stepping in for Delphine Seyrig and Andrea Rau. Three aspects of the film I haven't tackled yet are Eduard Van Der Enden's fabulous cinematography Francois De Roubaix's wonderful music score and the screenplay. Even though the film is an international coproduction the latter cowritten by Kumel Jean Ferry and associate producer Pierre Drouot has some beautifully lyrical English dialogue. Ferry was a notable screenwriter who had previously worked with HenriGeorges Clouzot on QUAI DES ORFEVRES 1947 whose recent Criterion DVD I also purchased with DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS Luis Bunuel Louis Malle and Georges Franju. Cinematographer Eduard Van Der Enden bathes the film in shades of black white and red  signifying the tyranny of the Nazi regime pretentious no? while the recurring red fadeouts precede Ingmar Bergman's in CRIES AND WHISPERS 1972. Composer Francois De Roubaix provides an eerie hypnotic accompaniment which totally suits the proceedings. It's strange to learn in the Audio Commentary that Kumel was dissatisfied with both and would have preferred giving these chores to Gerry Fisher and Bernard Herrmann respectively! It all goes to show that the greatest movies do come together by accident most of the time.The film has been known with a multitude of titles along the years throughout the world the original Belgian title was LE ROUGE AUX LEVRES literally meaning 'Lipstick On The Lips' but it was also known as LES LEVRES ROUGES 'The Red Lips'. In other countries then besides DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS it was also known as BLOOD ON THE LIPS CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT ERZEBETH THE PROMISE OF RED LIPS THE REDNESS OF THE LIPS and most ludicrously perhaps LA VESTALE DI SATANA 'The Vestal Of Satan' in Italy!Initially I was slightly disappointed by the video quality on the Blue Underground DVD since it occasionally suffers from print damage apparently it was transferred from the same source print utilized for the old Anchor Bay disc but having now sat through it three times including the Commentaries I'm getting used to that. I would have liked to have seen the 87minute version which played originally in US theaters included on the disc as well as some much needed biographical information on the elusive Harry Kumel but I'm nitpicking now. I still think this is an essential purchase for all true lovers of cinema but especially those with an affinity for arthouse and horror. The John KarlenDavid Del Valle Audio Commentary is the same one which was included on Anchor Bay's 1998 DVD and it is a reasonably informative easygoing affair and with a couple of genuine laughs as well. Here it is also revealed that Harry Kumel and John Karlen had had a falling out in midproduction and have probably never talked to each other since. However while a more sober and technical one the Harry KumelDavid Gregory Audio Commentary is the better of the two wherein Kumel discusses his stylistic influences and artistic intentions in making this film. Although this is his bestknown work by far he does not flinch from pointing out its deficiencies in his eyes and is rather dismissive of it as a whole referring to some of its most striking images Ilona's weird pose at the window when she attacks Valerie Elizabeth's batlike envelopment of Valerie in her cloak on the sand dunes in longshot etc. as insignificant. He also puts down directors like Roman Polanski and Martin Scorsese while extolling the virtues of several others including Jacques Tourneur and Robert Wise which he counts as a personal friend during the course of the discussion! He seems to have made DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS in order to attract the necessary financial resources to make his dream project MALPERTUIS 1972 starring Orson Welles but this does not diminish any of the undeniable qualities of this extraordinary film.I would really like to see more of Kumel's admittedly small output especially the two films which immediately preceded and followed this one MONSIEUR HAWARDEN 1968 and MALPERTUIS.".

I still think this is an essential purchase for all true lovers of cinema but especially those with an affinity for arthouse and horror. The John KarlenDavid Del Valle Audio Commentary is the same one which was included on Anchor Bay's 1998 DVD and it is a reasonably informative easygoing affair and with a couple of genuine laughs as well. Here it is also revealed that Harry Kumel and John Karlen had had a falling out in midproduction and have probably never talked to each other since. However while a more sober and technical one the Harry KumelDavid Gregory Audio Commentary is the better of the two wherein Kumel discusses his stylistic influences and artistic intentions in making this film. Although this is his bestknown work by far he does not flinch from pointing out its deficiencies in his eyes and is rather dismissive of it as a whole referring to some of its most striking images Ilona's weird pose at the window when she attacks Valerie Elizabeth's batlike envelopment of Valerie in her cloak on the sand dunes in longshot etc. as insignificant. He also puts down directors like Roman Polanski and Martin Scorsese while extolling the virtues of several others including Jacques Tourneur and Robert Wise which he counts as a personal friend during the course of the discussion! He seems to have made DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS in order to attract the necessary financial resources to make his dream project MALPERTUIS 1972 starring Orson Welles but this does not diminish any of the undeniable qualities of this extraordinary film.I would really like to see more of Kumel's admittedly small output especially the two films which immediately preceded and followed this one MONSIEUR HAWARDEN 1968 and MALPERTUIS.";

	schema:reviewBody "Beware as you go into this it may sound like Hammer but it's nothing like it. It's a chic stylish vampire film dripping with the most wanton aestheticism. The whole thing exudes the scent of an absinthe dream the contours of a flowing red dress.Superficially it is about a couple of newlyweds  but who as the film opens with them having sex in a train cabin openly declare that they don't love each other  who find themselves stranded in Ostande and move in to a strangely empty hotel for a few days. A countess Bathory arrives there with her female companion there's also the baffled concierge who tries to stay out of passion's way.I say superficially because the dynamics between the couple is what at first sight seems to be driving the story. The woman is desperate to break out from the limbo of anonymous sex and be introduced thus be legitimized as a wife and woman to the man's mother an aristocrat back in England. The man on the other hand is content to derail those expectations and savour the erotic dream he has concocted to inhabit.But of course we come to understand that the narrative is powered from outside. The countess courts both seducing in the emotional space between them. She personifies that wanton aestheticism right down to her body language. It is important to note that she is played by the actress who starred in Marienbad for Resnais which this film alludes to in the mysterious hotel setting with its expansive balustrades in the twilight wanderings in the sense of time revoked and sensations amplified.She is the architect of all this building around these people the desires that will yield them to her. So it is the man's semiconscious world of secret pleasures but it's she who is slowly slyly perverting them. She does this with the malevolent purity of a femme fatale.It does not matter that she is Bathory or that blood is eventually savored from wrists this is merely the desire made visible in a way that would appeal to a niche audience. So even though Jess Franco borrowed the velvety sunsets and decadent air from this for Vampyros Lesbos this operates deeper. It matters for example that she seduces the man into a new obsession with violence the destructive flipside of eros. It further pries the woman apart from him.Gradually what was a matter of taking pleasure from flesh is spun into something else entirely again involving flesh but now literally draining from his.It ends with a stunning sequence across countryside roads a lot of the imagery recalls L'Herbier  who also inspired Resnais  but here more pertinently. The soul has been so withered away from inside so consumed from the fever of passion that mere sunlight sends it reeling. Of course we can explain away by falling back to our knowledge of vampire lore but we'd be missing on the finer abstractions how for example the femme fatale is magically cast into the circumstances that as we know from our knowledge of this type of film would precipitate her demise. Nothing else would do after all.If we follow the set of reactions from what at first sight appears like an accident it can be plainly seen how it all flows from her desire to control the narrative.It's marvelous stuff just the same the colors the desolate aura. I just want to urge you to see as more than just an 'artsy vampire flick'. Save that for Jean Rollin.".

Daughters of Darkness as I am sure has been said numerous times before has higher aspirations than cheap thrills. That doesn't mean however that fans hoping for a trash quotient won't get it as there is a fairly generous dose of nudity male and female in one key scene. It's stately intelligent and very deliberately paced with a clear focus on character and ambiance. Now there are some genuine shock moments and scenes of sudden violence but they are few and far between.The action so to speak is mostly set inside a vast opulent hotel that a honeymooning couple is visiting in the wintertime. So it is actually almost empty until the couple Stefan John Karlen and Valerie Danielle Ouimet make the acquaintance of sophisticated Countess Bathory Delphine Seyrig who just might be THE Elizabeth Bathory of reallife infamy and her sultry companion Ilona Andrea Rau.Enhanced by lovely music composed by Francois de Roubaix the movie just like its cagey main character has a certain seductive allure going for it it's hard not to be captivated by Seyrigs' performance and hang on to every word she speaks. One can sense that her presence can only lead this young couple to some pretty dark places as passionate impulse takes over and the violent side of Stefans' personality is more prone to emerge. In fact as this story plays out The Countess doesn't seem as bad as Stefan turns out to be.The other actors do a fine job of reinforcing the notion that a substantial part of acting is REACTING as their characters feel the influence of this sexy stranger. The atmosphere and mood of this movie are simply excellent as right from the get go there is a very somber feel to the characters and dialogue. Stefan and Valerie go so far as to admit that their relationship is not really based on love. Character details like this are given throughout Stefan reacts with more than casual curiosity to being present at a murder scene and when he and the Countess recount the horrific acts of Elizabeth Bathory it arouses them more and more Valerie yells at them to stop and is it the sordid nature of what they speak the fact that they're getting turned on or both that is unnerving Valerie? What the characters realize about themselves and the others becomes vitally important to what unfolds.With its elements of lesbianism eroticism and sadomasochism this is an interesting piece of cinema for patient viewers.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1970's were the peak for the lesbianvampire films. They varied from being more mainstream titles such as Hammer's Carmilla adaptation The Vampire Lovers to more deliberately artsy trippy works such as Jess Franco's aptly named Vampyros Lesbos as well as basically every Jean Rollin film such as Shiver of the Vampires and Fascination. They all seemed to have been inspired one way or the other by Roger Vadim's exceptional Blood and Roses but none more so than Daughters of Darkness which is most definitely a cut above your regular Eurotica. But whereas Blood and Roses is a lonely delicate film Daughters of Darkness is a bolder darker and disturbing slice of the genre. I have a slight preference for Blood... if only for it's one of the few films that can make me cry but that doesn't diminish the impact of Daughters... at all  in fact it may even be the better of the two. As usual for an Eurohorror this is a visually breathtaking work of art. Harry Kumel's miseenscene is simply phenomenal with almost every shot being a knockout of imagery and aesthetic delight. The first two colorful death scenes are bound to make Dario Argento envious. From the lush but eerily deserted hotel interiors to the breathtaking shots of the Belgium twilight accompanied by Franois De Roubaix's minimalistic but effective score this is a visual and aural feast. Still so far it doesn't diverge much from the norm. What makes it stand above the titles mentioned above is that Daughters of Darkness is a very well written film with extremely developed characters  a rarity for the genre. Set in a vacant hotel whose sole guests are two young healthy and happy newlyweds and a mysterious Countess and her assistant. Judging by her name alone  Elizabeth Bathory  it's not surprise that the mysterious aristocrat is a vampire and the one responsible for a series of murders in the area. She sees the couple as both possible lovers as well as prey. The couple itself soon turn out not to be what they initially seemed as the husband in particular seems to have more than his share of skeletons in the closet. The Countess begins to realize this and soon she begins a terrifying mindgame with the two draining them first out of their sanity and moral values and then out of their blood. Kumel doesn't seem too interested in fangs and vampire attacks but rather in creating a claustrophobic decadent atmosphere of psychosexual madness that grows tighter and tighter as the story progresses to the point of becoming almost unbearable but yet you just can't take your eyes off the screen. The amazing use of editing quite ahead of it's time helps in creating this bewildering grueling atmosphere of a fever dream mostly through rough and rapid cuts or intercuts between different scenes. Another extra point is due to Delphine Seyrig's timeless portrayal of Elizabeth Bathory. Sporting the looks of a once glamorous but now decadent 1930's actress she is seductive and beautiful but yet something not quite right with her. Opting for a relatively lowkey performance she relies on her strong screen persona with her husky voice and enticing body language that lures the characters as well as the audience into her dark twisted world. Her casting is all the more ideal considering the film's constant references to Alain Resnais' Last Year in Marinebad of which she was the star. Danielle Ouimet and John Karlen while not on the same league as Seyrig but are quite good. Karlen is particularly convincing as another tortured soul who like Bathory possesses a vampirelike fascination with violence and is driven by madness by his own unwholesome backgrounds. Andrea Rau as the Countess' lover Illona doesn't have to do much other than look pretty but she gives a hysterical and haunting if brief showcase during her particularly nasty bathroom death scene  possibly the film's saddest and most cringeinducing set piece. The film's two more noticeable flaws are the somewhat silly final scene and the police officer character which detracts from the story. The latter's death is a somewhat humorous moment that feels out of place with what had been seen before. These flaws however are minor and easy to ignore specially since you consider it's degree of excellency in almost every other level. Overall this is a fascinating unique lesbian vampire film that definitely ranks among the very best of it's kind. It may not be for everyone but those looking for a more psychological emotionally raw take on this often used theme you simply can't go wrong with Daughters of Darkness.".

That is until a mysterious Hungarian Countess and her equally mysterious companion arrive and take rooms just next door. It soon becomes apparent that the Countess has designs on the young bride that could lead to her death. Is the Countess responsible for a string of deaths in the area of similar young women who have been drained of their blood? If a horror movie could be considered art Daughters of Darkness would certainly qualify. Almost every scene is like a painting  surreal lovely and haunting at the same time. Even the people especially the mesmerizing Delphine Seyrig as the Countess look and seem like they've just stepped out of a painting. Seldom do you see a character like the one played by Seyrig that seems so at home in her surroundings. She is amazing to watch.The movie is very slow moving. I could see many fans of modern cinema being put off by the pace. Don't expect any of the modern MTV style editing or explosions every five minutes. This movie takes its sweet time moving the plot along. But for those who stick with it you'll be rewarded by one of the most intriguing vampire films ever produced. The slow pace and isolated locations only add to what is surely one of the most atmospheric films I've seen.While watching the movie I couldn't help but be reminded of George Romero's Martin. Like Martin there is a certain ambiguity to the vampires in Daughters of Darkness. There's no doubt they drink blood but does this make them vampires? They are certainly not the fanged superhumans as portrayed in most Hollywood films. Like Martin they need external assistance to get the blood that they need or at least think they need.".

It is also strange that a Flemish director Harry Kumel was able to get big names Delphine Seyrig was an icon at that time and even the others were well known then. The quality available on the Blue Underground DVD is excellent even the sound is great no hiss or whatsoever. It is a beauty to see and remembering that it was made without a big budget.

Going a long way to make that happen depended on what actresses you could get to allure an audience.

Quite unconventional as it's a slowburn Gothic story driven by its concentration on exploring characters richly melancholy tragic and sadistic if still having an ambiguity to it all and arranging edgy if almost fairytalelike atmospherics. There's something slightly unsettling about its tone but while explicit it's done in a lowkey manner. An unforgettable Delphine Seyrig is beautifully mesmerizing as the infamous Scarlet Countess  Bathory  who bathed herself in the blood of 300 virgins for eternal youth. It's hard to take your eyes off Seyrig. An enticing Andre Rau with her striking facials large eyes and bob haircut plays the countess's young companion. These two characters come across a newlywed couple John Karlen and Danielle Ouimet staying at the same empty seaside hotel during the dead season. The countess soon becomes fascinated with the couple especially with the wife. Director Harry Kumel crafts out an exquisitely surreal looking nightmare where the detailed art direction the eerily grand hotel and hauntingly isolated locations is just as important as the story and performances. Visually captivating like the powerful positional work in the climax Eduard Van Der Enden's spaciously offbeat camerawork is distinctly framed in a sense if your peering in or sensually intruding while the unhinged music score is seductively expressive.".

	schema:headline " Classic erotic vampire film";
	schema:reviewBody "The vampire film was very popular in Europe in the early 70's. Several key entries in the genre were released at this time such as some interesting films from Hammer Studios as well as numerous titles from specialist auteurs like Jesus Franco and Jean Rollin. Unlike the majority of films from this subgenre Daughters of Darkness underplays the vampirism and nudity somewhat while still retaining a dark mood and overwhelming eroticism. It's certainly far classier than most others in the vampire genre and is committedly artistic with beautiful cinematography and costumes shot within interesting locations with a very effective and unusual soundtrack. Its story has a honeymooning couple Stefan and Valerie end up at a deserted hotel in Ostend where the only other guests are a pair of unusual women one of whom it turns out is the Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory.Like the later Don't Look Now 1973 Daughters of Darkness uses the strange mood of an offseason resort to great effect. Like that film too this is a horror film that really works simultaneously as an art film too. Director Harry Kmel needs to be given a great deal of credit for the stylish presentation that always feels like it accentuates the content rather than just being showy. The visuals are especially memorable and the use of colour quite excellent throughout while the strange setting adds its own unorthodox atmosphere to proceedings. It has to also be added that this is still a movie that does not disregard its horror angle at the expense of artistry as there are several macabre scenes and some that go for a much more visceral approach. It's a film that operates in several ways.These things all in themselves would ensure that Daughters of Darkness would be a classic within the genre but it doesn't even take into account the presence of Delphine Seyrig. This is a calibre of actress very rarely seen in this type of movie and she is really quite magnificent as Countess Elizabeth Bathory. She oozes sensuality throughout the picture and very easily convinces as a woman capable of seducing anyone. Her mysterious acting persona is one of her gifts  see it utilised in another famous enigmatic film Last Year at Marienbad 1961  and here it is her very screen presence that makes us believe in her supernatural character. Seyrig is clearly the star here and head and shoulders above everyone else but the rest of the cast actually do good controlled work too.Daughters of Darkness is certainly a classic of its type. It just seems to have a lot more going on in it and a pleasing ambiguity. Take for instance the character of Stefan who it becomes clear is not only a violent sexual sadist but whose overbearing 'mother' turns out to be a very strange man instead. It's these kinds of bold moves that make the film as a whole even more fascinating and disturbing. This is undoubtedly one of the alltime great European cult horror movies for several compelling reasons.".

The husband is supposedly unkind towards his wife who becomes seducedbewitched by Bathory.I thought it was fantastic but do believe many might be turned off by the rather icy presentationI wasn't. When anyone ever mentions EBath around me from time to time I will always think of Delphine Seyrig. She epitomizes theatricality in a good way. I love one scene after the burial of a specific person when the Countess opens her cape as the camera pulls back draping over her new acquisition. I think one can see the exact painstaking detail by the director and filmmaking collaborators to orchestratingly compose each and every scene..I respect the approach given to the film and think their efforts work splendidly. I found each female lead exuding their own type of beauty..and feel it's pretty difficult to take your eyes away from them.AS far as our male lead I particularly found one scene fascinating as a layer is slightly unpeeled when he contacts his mother on the phone. One might just see why he's in such mental turmoil just from this slight gaze into his life before his courtship and marriage to Daniele Ouimet. I didn't think Ouimet needed to bring any acting into this film I felt the director was using her beauty hypnotic..a term I throw around a bit too much but that's the reaction I felt so I use it hereas it was to frame artistic shots within the frame with John Karlen.I also liked how the director won't reveal Countess as a vampire per se instead showing her blood drinking in one particular scene..probably my favorite of the film when Seyrig isn't given the camera to do her thingfrom afar.One thing that many might criticize..that doesn't bother meis the deliberate slow pacing. This is an atypical horror film..it's more stylized art film..for instance what the director does with a red scarf as it drapes over a colorful lamp with the room dimmed a specific huewhere presentation from scene to scene is just as important as the characters and what their goals are within the scene.A user friend on the IMDb horror message board I felt was exactly right when he mentioned how Seyrig modeled her character after Dietrich. The way she moves her hands is exquisite how she smoothly delivers her dialogue how seductively she takes over the conversation and mood of each gathering and the way she is dressed. She's an amazing sight and I won't soon forget her departure from the film.".

Suddenly the sun is well overhead  amazing how fast it rises in that part of the world. The crash is almost a relief. How the sole survivor actually survives this gives us one more mystery to contemplate.However this is an art film not a Hollywood production  it's much more about mood than story or realistic people.

	schema:reviewBody "Having been a journalist and a documentary maker before turning to fiction it is hardly surprising to find that Alix Delaporte has a talent for capturing reality. In Angle et Tony the time is now and it shows Angle Tony their family and friends are indeed people that you could meet down the street at the baker's or at your local caf. Likewise the place a small fishing harbor in Normandy is anything but artificial. Shot entirely on location in PortenBessin a small town by the sea which was already the setting of Marcel Carn's La Marie du Portin 1949 and of Zanuck's The Longest Day in 1962 the film gives you the feeling you have always lived there all that lacks being the spray of the sea and the smell of fish! Socially speaking Angle et Tony is grounded in reality as well. The hardships of being among the last fishermen in France and the struggle to survive as such are aspects that are examined seriously albeit briefly through descriptions conversations and tense confrontation with the police. Last but not least the relationships between the characters ring true Angle Tony Tony's mother face and confront each other using ordinary everyday words in close connection with their immediate environment.On the other hand Alix Delaporte does not mistake realism for naturalism which is a good point. Sure Angle has a troubled past but the writerdirector does not dwell on it. Agreed a fisherman's life is no life of roses but Alix Delaporte shows them taking action not moaning about their lot. Granted the relationships between Angle and Tony are difficult but this is not the point. The real point is to show how these strangers who have apparently nothing in common will open to each other and try to exist as a couple becoming better human beings in the process. Such a positive dynamic makes Angle et Tony a potentially depressing drama a pleasant movie both instructive and entertaining.The leading couple is a surehanded choice and contributes to the success of Alix Delaporte's first fictional effort. Clotilde Hesme constantly finds the right note managing to combine stubborn aggressiveness and touching frailty. And Gregory Gadebois turns in an interesting performance as a lifelike fisherman withdrawn and brooding but hiding romantic feelings behind this facade. His restrained acting style is so natural that you would never think he is a member of the ComdieFranaise.All in all a good film but which could have been even better had the director avoided a few lengthy passages in particular when it comes to Angle riding her bike. Why spend so much film time on scenes that do not bring much to the whole thing Okay Angle zigzags a metaphor of her wayward ways but she does it too often and too long  five seconds are enough to get the point! while there are more interesting aspects which would benefit from a more indepth approach? However this is only a minor defect and it should not deter you from spending an hour and a half in the company of Angle and Tony.".

Her smile lit up the screen in that one and it does the same in this one. She's an excellent actress. The acting is all good actually. The story is simple and predictable enough if you want to predict things but it's very nicely told with delightful understatement and restraint. The film is beautifully photographed again with great restraint so that the beauty of the northern sea and sky and the pale and subtle colours of the landscape are allowed to emerge and speak for themselves. The film doesn't pretend to be anything more than a simple romance. It certainly doesn't pretend to be great. But it is in fact very good.".

It is a small picture about ordinary people that come together in an unexpected way. One can easily identify with the simple story that M. Delaporte has created.Angele a young woman recently released from prison after serving four years wants to be near her son that has been living with her parents. The boy feels badly because the rejection he perceives happened when his mother disappeared from his life. Angele must find an employment that will prove to the judge in charge of her case she is a reformed woman capable of regaining her son's custody.The only thing available for Angele is working as a fishmonger for Tony the fisherman who works with his mother selling what he gets from the sea. Tony a heavyset man is a shy person as it is obvious he is also afraid of being rejected by any woman he might decide to go after. Living and working with his mother things become hard for the young Angele to overcome. After all she has no experience.It is not hard to think that Tony wants to help Angele even going against his better judgment and upsetting his own mother but Angele is able to overcome her initial awkwardness and suddenly she gains Tony's mother trust as well as his love something that was hidden behind their outward acceptance of one another.Alix Delaporte got an ensemble atmosphere for his project. Clotilde Esme is lovely as Angele. Gregoire Gadebois a member of the prestigious Comedy Francaise makes an impression as Tony the fisherman with a heart of gold. Evelyn Didi plays Myriam Tony's mother. Claire Mathon's cinematography takes us along the Normandy coast to picturesque fishing villages and other places capturing the atmosphere of the area. Mathieu Maestracci contributed to the music score. M. Delaporte shows he is a natural for being behind the camera and one can only hope he will go far in his next venture.".

For the first two or three reels Delacorte is happy to let us see the negative aspects of Angele and have her unable to penetrate the defensive shell of Gadebois and conclude the relationship has nowhere to go and then the humanity that has been simmering beneath the surface in both cases bursts out joyously and we have a charming love story on our hands. Like Ariane Ariscade the face of Clotilde Hesme in repose in not so prepossessing but when she smiles she can just like Ariscade light up a whole city.

The editing was pedestrian. The camerawork didn't show me anything new. Watching someone ride their bicycle endlessly doesn't add any enjoyment to my life! The unerotic sex scene at the very beginning was not a good way to begin a movie! Usually when I see French films I want to go to where the film was made but this was definitely not the case with this graceless dull movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Despite having some talent and material to work with this feature produces just a few good moments and it never really comes together the way it might have. The cast headed by Ginger Rogers and including some fine supporting actors certainly supplied plenty of talent. The story idea was only mildly imaginative but it had the potential for some decent comedy and entertaining romantic mixups. But it seems to go in too many different directions at different times and perhaps as a result it has a few stretches of good material packed amidst some longer less interesting parts.Rogers was easily one of the more attractive and talented actresses of her era but the role of Arlette just doesn't seem to work for her. The character is not really as interesting as the situation and Rogers often seems to be trying too hard. In any case the character never quite rings true.The story starts with Arlette a reluctant enrollee in a school for petty criminals getting roped into a scheme by an unscrupulous aristocrat that plunges her into a series of romantic and personal complications as she develops a tangled relationship with a diplomat played by JeanPierre Aumont. The story is pure fluff deliberately implausible but with some good possibilities and it would likely have worked better with a lighter more farcical touch all around.Basil Rathbone is well cast as the 'professor' at the crime school and there are some amusing details in his classes and teaching methods but all of the sequences in the 'school' are essentially just elaborations on the basic gag idea. Adolphe Menjou was an ideal choice for the unprincipled nobleman but he has to contend with some clunky dialogue in his part. For all of these and other reasons Heartbeat  though probably worth seeing  never hits its stride and it delivers less than it could have.".

	schema:reviewBody "A light comedy like this is so different from typical Hollywood fare. It's a delightful French omelette  fluffy and sophisticated all at once. It leaves a sweet savour and refreshment where other 'zany' comedies rely on just heaping up one clich after another thick and fast with an often indigestible overcooked somewhat tiresome result.Heartbeat keeps you guessing what will come next like the most skilled flirt.Six years earlier in 1940 the film Beat of the Heart Battement de Coeur was produced in France starring the stunning Danielle Darrieux and the incredibly charismatic Claude Dauphin. As an American remake Heartbeat according to the credits was the creation of the three original French writers plus two additional Hollywood writers for adaptation and additional dialogue.Overall it makes its transcultural moves very well in a romantic dance across the Atlantic.Ginger Rogers is completely convincing as an 18year old and on this point I disagree with other reviewers. It should be considered for the sake of argument that an 18year old woman in Europe in 1940 or in 1946 had the maturing experience of World War II imprinted on her mind and heart. Truly such a creature was a childwoman not a plastic doll an airhead a sex object or a narcissistic 'Material Girl'. She would have had the character of an adult combined with true innocence the innocence of a person who has seen cruelty and ugliness and crime but has not yet personally become corrupted. As a matter of fact I don't think any 18year old American starlet would have had a clue as to how to play this part effectively. The following actresses certainly would have been the right age. Amazingly these five were the only American ingnues with star quality in 1946. Would you have cast any one of them instead of Ginger Rogers? I doubt it. They simply weren't ready yet for such a role.Patricia Neal age 20 Grace Kelly age 17 Janet Leigh age 19 Jeanne Crain age 21 Ann Blyth age 18.On the other hand these two European lovelies would have been perfect and they were already skilled on both stage and screen. But they would not come to Hollywood for several more years.Audrey Hepburn age 17 Jean Simmons age 17.Adding to its unique character Heartbeat handles some very mature themes with a delicate Cosmopolitan flare. The leading man is the lover of a married woman and he is in the diplomatic corps of her older husband the Ambassador. This portrayal by Adolphe Menjou is perfect  suave funny devious and attractive. Now Arlette knows from the very beginning that the handsome JeanPierre Aumont the man she is falling in love with the man who enjoys baiting her innocence is himself a scoundrel. For his part he tries to get rid of her puppydog affection by marrying her off to a sponger who will take her off his hands for a price. The actor captures this duplicity expertly. He is not at all a onedimensional Romeo!By the way the humorous sponger is played to the hilt by British comic actor Melville Cooper who was actually a true hero a veteran of the First World War who had been captured by the Germans. Another tourdeforce performance is delivered by Russian emigr Mikhail Rasumny. He was already 56 when he charmed the viewers of Heartbeat playing the thiefbutler who counsels Arlette when she needs it most.As for the opening episodes with Basil Rathbone playing a sort of Fagin to a motley group of overaged delinquents these scenes serve to introduce Arlette as a most extraordinary young lady indeed. She actually manages to fool Professor Aristide himself the expert schemer and arch criminal of them all! A spectacularly funny cameo for Sherlock Holmes!Far from suffering through this film let alone finding it boring I was immensely entertained to the very end. The 'Hollywood ending' was really not predictable. In a film like this anything could have happened.The whole fantasy was delightfully bubbly like pink champagne.".

	schema:reviewBody "I waited to view 'Heartbeat' until I had first managed to watch the French original from 1940 that this movie is derived from. I felt that to see them in chronological order offered the best chance to appraise them relatively.I thoroughly enjoyed 'Battement de coeur' finding it possessed a lightness of touch and was full of sparkling wit. Despite watching it on a SECAM tape that didn't play terribly well in my PAL VCR the French original bowled me over with its zest and sprightly charm. The inestimable Danielle Darrieux shines as only she can.After such a pleasing viewing experience I was rather intrigued to discover how the story would play out under different auspices but with Max Kolpe again contributing to the writing. It really proved to be a bad case of dejavu when a week later I watched the DVD of 'Heartbeat'. I honestly don't know who decided that it should be a scenebyscene remake. Constrained by adhering rigidly to the scenes from 'Battement de coeur' 'Heartbeat' was always going to struggle to be anything other than forced in areas to persons who had already viewed the 1940 movie. For example the scene where Ginger Rogers kicks the floor in adolescent frustration at being detained just falls flat whereas the scene in 'Battement de coeur' exhibited buckets of vitality and flouncing joie de vivre. The halfhearted reenactment of scenes and characters' movements was eerie and strange to observe.Up to about twothirds of the way through I wasn't particularly held by the script or by the performances. For me the early scenes in the pickpocket school are uninspired recreations of those in 'Battement de coeur'. Even the dummy they practice on is exactly the same! Luckily though it gradually grew on me and began to charm me somewhat. In contrast to many reviewers I feel that the romantic elements of the second half aid the movie considerably. The scenes in the last reel of Rogers and Aumont dancing contain more spontaneity and zest than those that have gone before. 'Heartbeat' is inoffensive and contains some reasonably funny moments involving watches. Despite being overaged for her role I thought Rogers was appealing and displayed a nice mix of teenage shyness and spunkiness. Adolphe Menjou and Basil Rathbone appear fleetingly but are good value as always. As the teacher Rathbone is watchable but he cannot quite equal the menacing and imposing performance of Saturnin Fabre in 'Battement de coeur'. Menjou does well and is at the centre of many of the funniest intrigues. Overall the movie is relatively likable but considerably hamstrung by its aping of the French original. Do attempt to take in 'Battement de coeur' before seeing this for goodness' sake!".

In relation to Ginger playing a much younger character than her years how can one forget her in The Major and The Minor at age 32 passing herself off as a 12 year old? With the softest focuses available at the time this was still an incredible piece of casting! I believe this film was a remake of a French film entitled Battement De Coeur made in 1939 which I intend to track down for comparison purposes.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very watchable movie but it is also amazingly dumb in places and should have been a lot better. A lot of the problem should rest on the shoulders of Ginger Rogers who for at least the second time in her career is ridiculously portraying a woman half her age! This 35 yearold actress plays an 18 yearold and is about as convincing at that as she would have been playing Hattie McDaniel's role in GONE WITH THE WIND! This same ridiculous idea was the plot for another Rogers film THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR where at 32 she played a school girl!!! While a very small number of actresses MIGHT have been able to carry this off Ms. Rogers appeared at least her chronological age and in both films it just comes off as ridiculous. While not quite as bad as Mae West in MYRA BRECKINRIDGE who was 77 and STILL making passes at young men it was still along the same lines as far as actresses who won't admit that they are no longer the young starlets they had once been decades earlier.The second problem is that the film in many ways has two totally different tones. I loved the first portion of the film where we see Basil Rathbone operating a school for wouldbe thieves! This segment is very funny and incredibly originalI really wanted to see much more of this. The second portion was a very familiar love story with complications. Sure it was fun to watch but not nearly as much as the other partand it was very very hard to believe that the budding romance could be real. Frankly the film tries a bit too hard and comes off as forced.The bottom line is that this is merely a timepasser and nothing more. If you do watch it though try not to laugh when Ginger tells the camera how old she is supposed to beit isn't supposed to be a comedy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Actress Ginger Rogers is best known for her performances in RKO's musical films in which she was partnered with Fred Astaire such in the case with 1935's film 'Top Hat'  1936's film 'Swing Time'. However after two commercial failures with Astaire in 1938's 'Carefree'  1939's 'The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle. Rogers began to branch out into dramatic films and comedies. This movie is one of those films. Directed by Sam Woods the film tells the story of a young nave struggling escapee Arlette Ginger Rogers willing to do anything in an attempt to avoid going back to reform school even dealing with schemers liars and cheats by pickpocketing and playing the system in Aristocratic Paris. Without spoiling the movie too much the first part of the movie was indeed the best part as I found the idea of a pickpocket academy to be very unique even if it's a bit unbelievable. It remind me so much of author Charles Dicken's 'Oliver Twist' with everybody trying to get Arlette to do something very wicked. However after a few scenes of pickpocketing the film really turn into mindless boring fluff with her abandoning it for another gold digger scheme in which she tries to shame marry an aristocrat in order to get a working permit. Because of that the film plot got really generic and forgettable. Plus all the life was suck out of the room as the humor and great acting was gone as interesting supporting characters like Professor Aristide Basil Rathbone Yves Mikhail Rasumny  'the Ambassador' Adolphe Menjou were replaced by belowstandards hammy acting from JeanPierre Aumont as Pierre de Roche  Melville Cooper as Pierre's friend Roland. It was no longer fun to watch. It would likely have worked better if personalities like Aristide and 'the Ambassador' stick around longer. Both were amazing characters. Who knew that an actor that is best known for playing detectives Basil Rathbone would be so great as a funny masterful criminal! He was wonderful! For Mikhail Rasumny I hate the fact that his character was barely used. He was wonderful as the trouble man looking for work. For Adolphe Menjou he was the only actor that seem like he was from France. Everybody else seem like they were miscast. Don't get me wrong Ginger Rogers isn't bad in the role that she was given but her American southern accent was pretty jarring to hear in a film that supposedly taking place in Europe. It would have work better if the movie explain that she was indeed an illegal immigrant AKA American in France living in the streets. Then it would make sense why her character acts the way she does. Another thing that was jarring about her performance was the fact that the 35 year old Rogers was playing an 18 year old reform school delinquent. It was just too big a stretch for this viewer's imagination. Despite not looking the part she does had a mix of teenage shyness and spunkiness. However I wish the movie used more of her dancing skills. The ballroom scenes could had been better if that was the case. Still the movie had some really good scenes that shows the pressures of selfpreservation. I love the movie theater scene it was brilliant. Seeing the surrounding speaks without the character moving their mouth was a wonderful move by the director even if the movie they are seeing is it's a bit too convenient to what is happening in the main plot. Still in the end I have to say the original French film in which this movie was based on Battement de Coeur AKA Beat of the Heart was better. After all everything about this American version seem like a shot for shot remake of 'Beat of the Heart'. Even the dummies are nearly the same. So they had to be doing something right. In my opinion even the acting was better. French actress Danielle Darrieux  actor Claude Dauphin were far more stunning savour and incredibly charismatic than anybody in 'Heartbeat'. Also the plot was more focus on the pickpocketing than this film. At least the good oldfashioned happy ending in 'Beat of the Heart' seem more earn than it was in the American remake. So overall I have to say Heartbeat' is a few beats off from me really liking it. It's too bad because this movie could had stolen my heart but it didn't. It was just disappointing.".

Unfortunately Jean Pierre Aumont shows up and the comedy disappears. We get a love story that doesn't really go anywhere. There's little chemistry between Rogers and Aumont. Plus there's the problem of having a real Frenchman playing with an American actress who is supposed to be a French woman but does not have a French accent.The movie also doesn't take place at any particular time. At first I thought we were in the 1890's in Paris but then it sort of shifted to the 1920's and 30's. In the narrative the movie takes place over a few weeks so this is not a deliberate time jump just a result of sloppy filmmaking.The movie should have stuck with Rathbone and Menjou but they disappear for much of the second half of the film and we are left with the much duller character of Aumont. This forces Rogers to supply whatever comedy and passion the film is capable of showing. She looks like she's waiting for Fred Astaire to show up. Alas he never does.".

Plus there's the problem of having a real Frenchman playing with an American actress who is supposed to be a French woman but does not have a French accent.The movie also doesn't take place at any particular time. At first I thought we were in the 1890's in Paris but then it sort of shifted to the 1920's and 30's. In the narrative the movie takes place over a few weeks so this is not a deliberate time jump just a result of sloppy filmmaking.The movie should have stuck with Rathbone and Menjou but they disappear for much of the second half of the film and we are left with the much duller character of Aumont. This forces Rogers to supply whatever comedy and passion the film is capable of showing. She looks like she's waiting for Fred Astaire to show up. Alas he never does.";

Ginger's other side of the track characters at least had some class and knew when to shut up. Another major issue is that she's about 15 years too old for this part a young waif out of reform school becomes a professional pickpocket trained by Basil Rathbone and later taken in by the suave Menjou whose really out for no good as well. Along comes Jean Pierre Aumont to sweep her off her feet and it's on the path to reform for the out of her element Ginger who wasn't having much success in films in the mid 1940's in spite of still being considered an A lister.This seems to be striving for the European style of films not the Italian or French new wave but an operatic elegance that was present in the films of Cocteau but seems forced and overstuffed here ultimately seeming pretentious. Indeed it is a remake of a French film. Ginger has one scene where she gets to screech like a teenager making me wonder if dogs were barking in the San Fernando valley as she filmed this scene in Hollywood. She's forced to speak like a much younger character and dresses closer to how I'll Be Seeing You costar Shirley Temple did. Menjou seems like he's still acting in the romantic comedies of the early 1930's as if he was in another film altogether. This is pretty much an almost fiasco but it looked so good in its lavishness that I just couldn't bear to give this a bomb.

	schema:reviewBody "Madame X is one of the great soap opera films of all time popular back in the day but by the sixties that genre had really run its course. But it is given one handsomely mounted production by Ross Hunter who was the last great Hollywood producer of such drama.This film has a long pedigree. It is based on a play by Alexandre Bisson entitled La Femme X and in France it has been filmed quite a few times. In America Madame X was filmed twice. The original film was an early talkie and won an Oscar nomination for its star Ruth Chatterton. But that one was essentially a photographed stage play.Come 1966 if nothing else Ross Hunter made this film move. All kinds of location shooting done here from Fairfield County Connecticut to Switzerland to Mexico and back to New York. It's the 20 year saga of Holly Anderson who paid big time for a bad mistake.Lana Turner played Anderson who when we meet here has just married Clayton Anderson from a very old line WASP family with a pedigree back to the pilgrims.

She signs a written confession with an X hence the title.I won't tell the rest but make sure the bathtowel is handy while watching this film. Lana Turner who knew plenty about scandal and sacrifice in her life does pretty well by this role. The rest of the players are in support of her almost in awe.By this time soap opera had found its way on to the small screen both in the afternoon and evening prime time. Films like Madame X just didn't do that well any more at the box office. A pity too because you won't forget Turner's climatic scene with her grown son played by Keir Dullea.".

	onyx:emotionText "Madame X is one of the great soap opera films of all time popular back in the day but by the sixties that genre had really run its course. But it is given one handsomely mounted production by Ross Hunter who was the last great Hollywood producer of such drama.This film has a long pedigree. It is based on a play by Alexandre Bisson entitled La Femme X and in France it has been filmed quite a few times. In America Madame X was filmed twice. The original film was an early talkie and won an Oscar nomination for its star Ruth Chatterton. But that one was essentially a photographed stage play.Come 1966 if nothing else Ross Hunter made this film move. All kinds of location shooting done here from Fairfield County Connecticut to Switzerland to Mexico and back to New York. It's the 20 year saga of Holly Anderson who paid big time for a bad mistake.Lana Turner played Anderson who when we meet here has just married Clayton Anderson from a very old line WASP family with a pedigree back to the pilgrims. John Forsythe is Clayton and in her last film Constance Bennett is his mother Estelle. They have a son but Forsythe's political career takes him away for long stretches and she begins an affair with playboy Ricardo Montalban.

	schema:reviewBody "The old chestnut Madame X has had something like 9 screen versions not to mention a play and the book. There's an occasional change here and there but the plot remains basically the same A young woman is thrown out of her home and separated from her child. She hits the skids and 20 years later the child defends her on a murder charge.So goes this version of Madame X as well with a nice roster of stars Lana Turner Keir Dullea John Forsythe Ricardo Montalban Constance Bennett and Burgess Meredith. Turner is the unfortunate woman happily married to Clayton Anderson John Forsythe a man with a good political future and she's the mother of a young son. But the marriage becomes strained when Clayton is away too much and Holly starts fooling around. When her husband comes home and she realizes how much she loves him she tries to break it off with a rou Ricardo Montalban. During an argument he falls down the stairs to his death. Holly's motherinlaw played by Constance Bennett arranges for her to disappear with a new identity. In Europe Holly meets a wealthy musician who falls in love with her but she runs out on him  a big mistake  and ends up turning to alcohol and easy sex. When she murders a blackmailer Meredith who is going to tell her son who she is she ends up on trial  defended by her son.Well the pot doesn't boil any better than this and Hunter gives it a big expensive production and sets Lana Turner loose in what is probably her best performance. Although the agedissipation makeup is a little over the top Turner gives the degenerate Holly a great hard edge and a lot of frailty. It's a nice juxtaposition to the earlier sweetness and buoyancy of her character. Turner was one of those movie stars whose beauty glamor and private life often had critics not paying much attention to her performances but she gave some good ones nonetheless. The other standout in the cast is Bennett who's as slender as she was in the '30s and a lot tougher. Her voice has dropped a couple of octaves and her hair is a strange brown this was perhaps in deference to the blond Lana. Toward the end of the film she gets white hair softly styled and looks beautiful  even with the age makeup that needed to be added to the 60yearold. The role of Forsythe's manipulative protective mother is perfect for her  a fitting last film for one of the great and prolific stars of the 1930s. She died before the film was released. Keir Dullea is appealing as the son and Forsythe is pleasant though he doesn't have a huge role.Try as they might Madame X is from another time and by 1966 just wasn't great movie material. It is however entertaining and engrossing. The most jaded person can't help but to be moved by the ending though you may hate yourself for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Madame X is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I would recommend it to every movie goer not just Lana's fans. She manages to portray to perfection a very very complex character and she certainly deserved an Oscar. I liked in particular her scenes with another fine actor John Van Dreelen who shared with Lana some very nice romantic moments. The actor actually said in an interview that his chemistry with Lana was as good onscreen as it was offscreen and this does a lot of good to the film. I also bought the magnificent book Madame X by Michael Avallone which was published in 1966. I recommend it to everyone because it was adapted after the original screenplay of Jean Holloway. Thanks to the book I managed to discover the scenes that were cut from the film such as the scene where Holly is trying to get a job at an expensive French shop and also a scene where Christian the pianist Van Dreelen is giving her a hint that they should marry because the whole press was discussing about them during his concert tour. So in order to avoid gossip and scandal he thought they ought to marry. This was his first proposal to her while they were driving an automobile  and that is why in one of the sequences with them in the car Lana's character seems preoccupied about something. The novel reveals that she was very much in love with this artist who became her God or guardian angel but whom she had to leave so that neither he nor her first husband played by John Forsythe would find out who and where she really is. A great book and a great film! I bought the original DVD from France and it was an excellent purchase. The music is also superb and the soundtrack was released separately in 1967. I only wish there were kept more scenes from Madame X because the film is much too short to understand the complexity of the plot. Still I highly recommend it even if it is a very sad film a real tearjerker.".

Thanks to the book I managed to discover the scenes that were cut from the film such as the scene where Holly is trying to get a job at an expensive French shop and also a scene where Christian the pianist Van Dreelen is giving her a hint that they should marry because the whole press was discussing about them during his concert tour. So in order to avoid gossip and scandal he thought they ought to marry. This was his first proposal to her while they were driving an automobile  and that is why in one of the sequences with them in the car Lana's character seems preoccupied about something. The novel reveals that she was very much in love with this artist who became her God or guardian angel but whom she had to leave so that neither he nor her first husband played by John Forsythe would find out who and where she really is. A great book and a great film! I bought the original DVD from France and it was an excellent purchase. The music is also superb and the soundtrack was released separately in 1967. I only wish there were kept more scenes from Madame X because the film is much too short to understand the complexity of the plot. Still I highly recommend it even if it is a very sad film a real tearjerker.";

	schema:reviewBody "Coming in pretty late in the women's picture cycle which had it's peak in the '40's and a resurgence in the late '50's and early '60's is this Lana Turner tour de force. Very few people in 1966 were willing to allow themselves to be swept away by such a romantic sentimental and at times preposterous storyline but if taken as a fable of mother love the film delivers in spades. Turner at 45 a touch old for the earliest scenes but still very effective marries a wealthy politician Forsythe with designs on the White House. She is immediately disdained by his socially prominent mother who lays in wait for her to make a mistake which will give her the ability to offload Turner for good. The time finally comes and Turner is forced to leave her husband and small boy without even a goodbye. This is only the beginning of the story as Turner endures a lifetime of depression and oppression along with unwanted affection. The whole thing culminates years later in what is for some one of the ultimate tearjerking moments in film. For the cynical...it's all just sappy soap opera. It is overwrought and overdone at times but is extremely plush and grand and has a familiar cast which does an excellent job throughout. It's amusing to see Turner become involved with Blake Carrington Mr. Rourke and The Penguin as she goes along but each actor compliments her in some way. She goes from ingenue to feeble sickly old woman in what many consider to be her finest film work ever. Dullea was never more appealing...his blue eyes searing the screen. Threatening at all times to steal the show is brittle Bennett in her last film role. Rail thin and sporting a hilarious red Mary Tyler Moorestyle wig she is a firebreathing raspyvoiced condor. She is denied a chance to shine at the end but lingers in the memory as a venomous villain. The overthetop musical score by Frank Skinner only adds to the fun and all the hallmarks Jean Louis gowns fine jewels furs... of a great women's picture are in place. Curl up and have laugh or two and then a good cry.".

Yes this is a movie where Lana Turner kills both Khan and the Penguin but it's less campy than one might think unlike Turner's following film the hilarious acid trip movie The Big Cube.

	schema:reviewBody "Madame X is one of the perennial tearjerkers that has been revived again and again since its original incarnation as a play around 1910. The casting of John Forsythe in the pivotal role of the title character's husband is a big hint at what's in store in this shrinkwrapped Ross Hunter production. But it works chiefly due to a moving performance by Lana Turner which takes about thirty minutes to kick in. THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS Until then Turner seems inappropriate as a young newlywed. Later when her icy motherinlaw Constance Bennett forces her into lifelong anonymous exile after a scandal involving a high society ladies man Ricardo Montalban she finds herself rejected and abandoned whereupon Turner comes to life as a lost desperate aging alcoholic wretch wandering the globe trying to forget her past her husband and most of all her little son. Burgess Meredith is appropriately hissable as a con artist who meets her in a sleazy Mexican hotel learns of her past and schemes to make money from her tragedy by using her to blackmail her wealthy exhusband.Constance Bennett who came out of retirement to play the nasty matriarch contributes muchneeded zing to the routine expository section. Gone is the slinky throwaway charm of her youth in its place is a lacquered reptile all class and style some slink but no soul. It was her last film she died shortly after this production wrapped. And it was Lana Turner's final bow as a serious leading lady after this she did nothing of note. How sad that so many studioera American movie stars had to call it quits in early middleage just when many of them were learning how to act! In any event by 1966 Madame X was considered old fashioned and irrelevant panned by critics and largely ignored by audiences. It works well on the small screen because production values spectacle and visual artistry were never the essence of this story anyway. If by the last moments you haven't already dismissed it as contrived melodrama the finale is heartrending.".

	schema:reviewBody "LANA TURNER knew a good part when she saw it. And there was even a courtroom scene that she could savor while she recalled her own real life courtroom drama a decade earlier. She digs into the script with all of her being and gives one of the strongest performances of her career. Unfortunately her costar John Forsythe is all but invisible in a thankless role. But because the story was an old chestnut that had been done many times before Hollywood seemed to turn its back on her work and she received not even a nomination for this one of her best roles.At 45 she was really too old for the early scenes depicting her as the young bride of a wealthy political candidate but her makeup is expert and she looks radiant. She is soon to be undone by her mean motherinlaw a youthful looking Constance Bennett who incidentally just had a face lift before starting the film much to Turner's distress. The plot has Turner getting involved with a playboy Ricardo Montalban who gets too serious before she decides to ditch him. She rejects him and an accidental fall down a steep stairway ends in his death and leads to the motherinlaw's scheme to get rid of the unwanted Turner by sending her into exile and making her give up custody of her young son.The suds get thicker as Turner turns into a lonely woman who can never forget her past and the son she left behind. After an irrelevant episode with a concert pianist who wants to marry her Curt Jurgens she hits the skids and ends up boozing it up in Mexico with an unscrupulous Burgess Meredith. At this point in the film Turner really does the kind of emoting that should have guaranteed at least an Oscar nomination. She pulls no punches in revealing with gut wrenching honesty what she has become under the influence of alcohol bitter selfcontempt and loneliness. It almost comes as a relief when she reaches for a gun and shoots Meredith when he plans to use her for his own ends.Her acting is further strengthened by some courtroom scenes that show the ravages that her wasted life have done to her once lovely facade. And her expression in court when she realizes that the young lawyer defending her is her own son says more than a thousand words of script. There are moments throughout the film where she does some of her best acting since PEYTON PLACE.She is wonderfully supported in the final scenes by some excellent work from Keir Dullea who shows great sensitivity in his dealings with the woman he only knows as Madame X. His final line I loved her from the moment I first saw her is guaranteed to make the eyes tear after Turner's emotional courtroom outburst. Constance Bennett is efficient and cold as her motherinlaw but John Forsythe has such an underwritten role as Turner's busy husband that his performance is as wooden as any he has ever given. Luckily for him he found his niche on television.By all means if you're in the mood for a good tearjerker and would like to see Lana at her best this is one that you can't miss. The background score by Frank Skinner adds greatly to the story's effectiveness in wallowing in those soapy suds reminding one of the days when Max Steiner would have been called upon to do exactly that for a Bette Davis film.".

Yet this overwhelming tale will haunt you forever.The original 1966 trailer the packaging on the 2008 DVD and the opening credits give away a supposedly major surprise at the concluding portion of this swiftly moving melodrama. We learn that Lana Turner's character Holly will stand trial for murdering a man and her lawyer is none other than the grown son she was forced to abandon when he was a young child. She becomes Madame X to hide from the sins of her past.There is a reason for this early revelation to the viewers. Holly initially doesn't know his adult identity and he is unaware of hers. Learning who he is she is understandably shocked. Since we already know the truth we are able to fully focus on her mental state instead of withdrawing into our own inner feelings.The trial was filmed during the heart of the civil rights battle. Despite Holly and the deceased and the jurors all being white her attorney employs an argument favored during that time  jury nullification meaning that a person should be acquitted even though technically breaking the law if a higher purpose is served. He justifies her killing the man not in self defense because the man was blackmailing her and threatening the welfare of her son. This is analogous to a battered housewife killing her tormentor while he sleeps not legal but nevertheless legitimate in the eyes of many citizens.We never learn the verdict because Holly dies before it is delivered. We the viewer are again free to fully focus on her death as she in the arms of her son comes to grips with what had happened in her life. Her last prerogative is to remain Madame X so he will not inherit her sins. In his heart he knows she is his mother.You cry buckets of tears not precisely for this fictional character rather in the name of the best within us as Ayn Rand described in her novel Atlas Shrugged. There Cherryl Taggart a shop girl struggling to do the right thing got in over her head and drowned herself. Holly was also a shop girl struggling to do the right thing got in over her head and drank herself to death.In addition to Turner fine performances are rendered by John Forsythe Constance Bennett Ricardo Montalban Burgess Meredith and Keir Dullea. Madame X offers exquisite theme music delivers much food for thought and can provide you a catharsis more valuable than numerous psychiatric sessions.You'll be grateful for this fabulous film.".

This is analogous to a battered housewife killing her tormentor while he sleeps not legal but nevertheless legitimate in the eyes of many citizens.We never learn the verdict because Holly dies before it is delivered. We the viewer are again free to fully focus on her death as she in the arms of her son comes to grips with what had happened in her life. Her last prerogative is to remain Madame X so he will not inherit her sins. In his heart he knows she is his mother.You cry buckets of tears not precisely for this fictional character rather in the name of the best within us as Ayn Rand described in her novel Atlas Shrugged. There Cherryl Taggart a shop girl struggling to do the right thing got in over her head and drowned herself. Holly was also a shop girl struggling to do the right thing got in over her head and drank herself to death.In addition to Turner fine performances are rendered by John Forsythe Constance Bennett Ricardo Montalban Burgess Meredith and Keir Dullea. Madame X offers exquisite theme music delivers much food for thought and can provide you a catharsis more valuable than numerous psychiatric sessions.You'll be grateful for this fabulous film.";

I have not seen many of her movies but this one shows her range in a rather favorable light. Constance Bennett also gives a performance that makes you love to hate her. And finally the young man that plays her son is very tender and real in his portrayal. This was a very endearing movie with a beautiful message. I would have to admit that the John Forstyth character seemed rather limited and did not allow for much character development. Perhaps this was a result of poor editing or weak character writing. I found myself wanting almost needing Madame X to reach out and tell her son who she is. This was the most emotionally charged part of the film I recommend this film to those interested in getting to know Lana Turner and her body of work.".

	schema:reviewBody "So you're married to an upandcoming politician who is in love with you but his work keeps him away for weeks at a time. You have an infant son to care for but a male friend of yours who is a smooth talker charms you into having an affair with him. Wanting to break off the affair you go to his apartment and after a scuffle he falls down the stairs and breaks his neck dying instantly. Unfortunately your meddling motherinlaw knows what happened and in an effort to save the reputation of her son she blackmails you forcing you to fake your own death by falling overboard from a ship leaving your husband and son to think that your are gone forever. If this sounds like a predicament that only Drama Queen Lana Turner could get herself into you're right and it's the plot of David Lowell Rich's 1966 film Madame X.Holly Parker Turner is banished by her motherinlaw to Europe where in her imminent grief and isolation begins a major downslide in her life. She takes up alcohol and lecherous men with equal ardor while her husband Forsythe and son continue to live their lives in the United States completely unaware. When Holly goes through the allowance that has been provided for her she finds herself back in the States in the company of Dan Sullivan Meredith a real slime ball who discovers her true identity and makes plans to use it to his advantage by alerting her husband and nowgrown son Clayton Jr. Dullea. Again there is a scuffle and Sullivan ends up dead Holly doesn't have a lot of luck in this area apparently only she doesn't run this time her life has become so low and her depression so great that she just wants to be tried for murder and to die. In an ironic twist mostly reserved for only the greatest of potboiling melodramas Holly who is refusing to speak and only goes by the name Madame X is being defended by her son a fact that remains undiscovered by Holly until she sees her husband in the courtroom. Clayton who obviously thinks she is dead can't believe that this woman is the same person he fell in love with twenty years ago and even the motherinlaw also in the courtroom to observe her grandson's first trial is stricken with grief over what she did to this poor woman's life. The only person who remains oblivious is Clayton Jr. who is protected until the bitter end.Madame X is Grade A Pure melodrama. It is kind of comparable to an overthetop film like Valley of the Dolls only it's cheesy and deliciously good rather than being cheesy and deliciously bad. Lana Turner a beautiful woman to be sure is about 45 in this movie and is at first playing a young wife. While reading up a little on the film after seeing it people were lauding her courage for playing old and unglamorous toward the end of the film which is certainly valid particularly since Turner is normally impeccably made up and coiffed in her films but she definitely wasn't a spring chicken in this one though she and the filmmakers tried to get away with it. Incidentally the woman who plays her motherinlaw showed up on the set with a face lift and looks almost the same age as Turner unfortunately. Age inappropriate and filtered camera lenses aside Turner is as good as she always is. She is up there with Bette Davis without the evil streak and Joan Crawford without the insanity in the upper echelon of classic drama queens.The story of Madame X is an old one and this is actually one of many film adaptations. Stripped down to a bottom line the purpose of melodrama is to get the waterworks going and Madame X worked on me as I was bawling by the end of it not that there isn't a melodrama that hasn't cracked me yet and therefore it gets a very solid 610 from me.Shelly".

TAXI DRIVER does however share with SEUL CONTRE TEUS a sense of psychosexual determinism.  The protagonists in both films are at least partly driven by sexual compulsions they either can not control feel they can not control or badly desire to explore.  Both films have memorable scenes that take place inside a porno theater emphasizing the dominance sex and sexual compulsions have over each of the protagonists though for different reasons in each of them.SEUL CONTRE TEUS however is less of a film about an inexorable pull toward insanity and instead is more of a film about an inescapable rage  the rage associated with a fiercely guarded sense of pride that has a strong tendency of violence toward anything that appears the least bit insulting and a rage that comes from endless feelings of loneliness.  The protagonist known only as The Butcher which is his past profession is consequently very vulnerable to feelings of humiliation and has little ability to make sound decisions in life.  SEUL CONTRE TEUS is about the rage of those in the working classes that suffer the pain of a hard childhood are punished for their crimes that mainly arise out of anger and endure the humiliation of unemployment and unwantedness  yet refuse to let the harshness of life knock them down for good.  The Butcher refuses to lie down.  He wants to fight back at whatever blocks his path.  But like an animal he chooses his targets arbitrarily and impulsively.  Those that he is most threatened by in reality offer little danger and perhaps could instead offer friendship or even assistance.The film features an astounding interior monologue that runs like an intensely embittered sermon told through a voice over throughout the duration of the film.  Many of The Butcher's thoughts are intensely provocative and refreshingly fearlessly insightful and profound.  My favorite is probably the line that says something like there is no revolution anymore when we are all alone there is only revenge. Valuable lines like this are mixed in with incendiary rants against foreigners and homosexuals  thoughts and emotions rooted in painfully stubborn pride and bitter humiliation but which sometimes have the feel of some desperate lost apocryphal truth to them.There are a couple of other qualities this film shares with TAXI DRIVER. For the most part even though they are quite frightening the protagonists in both films are sympathetic though again for different reasons and even charismatic.  Also both films have extremely violent climaxes that thematically and psychologically resemble the male orgasm gone psychotic. The conflation of sex and violence in both films is unmistakably real and psychologically and perhaps politically profound.  Also both films feature a twisted sense of redemption at the end though I will say no more than that for fear of spoiling the endings of both films  twisted in the sense that there is a future and not all hope is lost but it is a hope that is rooted in something unclean and false.  I think most people will find the scene of reconciliation and redemption toward the end of SEUL CONTRE TEUS to be remarkably moving at least until it turns into something perverse.This film is not for everyone  that's for sure.  If TAXI DRIVER was more than you bargained for then stay away from this film because this film is even more intense and brutal.  But for those of you who desire or even need to see a film about the rage of a man who is disenfranchised and dispossessed and is driven toward fantasies and expressions of violence and perversity  then here it is.  This is for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gaspar No's first fulllength film seeks to provide and sometimes achieves an elegantly bleak picture of the world through the eyes of a French butcher whose life has been devolving from day one. The film begins as a kind of quick documentary life narrated over still photos with the voiceover of the butcher played by Philippe Nahon. From here forward the voice never leaves us moving relentlessly forward with its declarations of gloom and anger. The narrator's negativism commands our attention and even our respect because of its intensity and clarity. Perhaps this man is just a depressive a hopeless loser. But his anger and his articulateness command attention and create an irresistible and memorable voice  a voice quite reminiscent of the writings of LouisFerdinand Cline Journey to the End of the Night Death on the Installment Plan who like No's protagonist was a nihilist fascist and antiSemite and likewise shocked with his bluntness of expression. Set in 1980 the story of I Stand AloneSeul contre tous may also be meant to reflect the thinking of a certain French underclass of that time whose desperation and resentment toward growing minorities in the country and toward the rich and the liberal bourgeoisie led them to rally behind the far right political leader JeanMarie Le Pen.Philippe Nahon is strong in the central role. Indeed one can hardly imagine anybody else playing it. But all the characters Nahon interacts with tend to be little more than static cameos. There are even moments when we are not sure they exist or when his declarations seem like fantasies and this uncertainty undermines the otherwise forceful narrative. Unfortunately also the film tends to disintegrate into excess verbiage and alternative finales in its last chapters. The nonstop narration has seemed to work well up to then but when No resorts to an overlapping second voice and approaches the father's sexual violation of his daughter through panning off into the street the voiceover becomes a wall preventing us from experiencing what's been dealt with and the hitherto blunt manner  the obscene slangy language and the gunshot blast divisions of images and the boldly declarative intertitles No is of the nothingsucceedslikeexcess school of filmmaking  comes to seem a bit of a facade. As in the later Irrversible it seems as though the director's desire to shock and exploit ingenious and attentiongetting cinematic techniques is greater than his willingness to develop a story and characters in depth. Nonetheless there are strong signs of a bold and original talent on display here and of an independent point of view. The respected critic Jonathan Rosenbaum went overboard when he classified I Stand Alone as a masterpiece. No strives so hard to achieve profundity he dupes himself into the certain conviction that he has achieved it. Whether I Stand Alone will stand the test of time is a question only time not No or Rosenbaum can decide. The film is not particularly well served by a Strand Leasing DVD providing a slightly blurry print and no extras. The Menu design however is rather handsome.Watched on Netflix DVD November 2005.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the last couple years french filmmaker Casper Noe has created quite a name for himself. With two full length films that are both extreme and psychologically disturbing. I Stand Alone is not as disturbing as Noe's Irreversible but it still is a bumpy ride that some people might not be prepared for. The main character is the jobless butcher who is featured in Noe's other films. The film narrates the history of the butcher's life and all the hardships he has faced. It's 1980 in the film and the butcher can't find a job. He lives with his whiny pregnant girlfriend along with her mother. The butcher's mute daughter seems to be the only person he cares about. Throughout the film we hear the thoughts of the butcher which are angry hateful and horrifying. He's at the point of a midlife crisis and wants to now live his life for vengeance. Peace of mind through a hand gun so to speak. He slowly starts to loose his sanity as he endlessly searches for a job and is turned down repeatedly. The film is very bleak like Taxi Driver and Bad Luitenant and psychotically tense like Clean Shaven. Viewers are even warned before the disturbing finale. Let's just say the butcher loves his daughter a little too too much. Casper Noe takes us inside the mind of a man who's sometimes racist misogynistic and homophobic but is still sympathetic towards the character's insanity. In fact I felt so bad for the butcher that the film made me almost cry. It has such poetic emotion. I have to say I Stand Alone and Clean Shaven are the two films which portray mental illness the most realistically. I say this because I have suffered with mental health problems since I was young and have been on many medications. At one point of my life when I was working 70 hours a week and on two medications I almost had a similar emotional breakdown like in the film. That's why I can identify with the butcher. The film is so gritty and realistic in it's portrait of insanity. Many people will probably find the finale frightening. I Stand Alone is a masterpiece of psychological drama and intensity unlike any other film. Casper Noe just may become this generation's Roman Polanski. I can't even imagine what he's going to do next.".

Society and it's egoism loneliness selfishness and individualism affect all humans. Some more than others. This movie is a rather extreme example but it is definitely what is needed to shake you and make this world a better place. Some might interpret it as a useless display of bitterness and turn their head to keep on living their comfortable lives. Probably most will do that by fear of confronting such a terrible reality. With that attitude nothing will change. I see the main's characters attitude as the natural consequence of a society without love a society where everything is given in exchange of something natural consequence of capitalism. Unfortunately people living afraid and with no love are everywhere. Their acts are a consequence of the extreme individualism and lack of interest of human beings towards others hence the lack of care for themselves hence the lack of love. Life is a selfish act. Unfortunately our society or in other words ourselves act selfishly. As long as that keeps on going the world will be a sad boring and lonely place. I have faith in humanity and in living in a world of care respect tolerance and responsibility towards the rest. Unfortunately we still have a looooong way to go. I recommend it to everyone specially the ones who do not like facing reality and prefer living in comfort. They need it more than anyone. I give it a well merited 10.".

Don't get me wrong I liked how it was filmed and how No played with a lot of avantgarde and art elements but in the end I have seen it as nothing more than a Inyourface Artmovie with interesting ideas.After reading multiple reviews about Seul contre tous I finally decided to watch it but before I wanted to see Carne the short that takes place before Seul contre tous and I was absolutely surprised on how good it was how twisted and how incredibly weird on such a realistic level it was. It's an understatement to say I was hyped for the highly controversial and kind of infamous Seul contre tous.But let's talk about my experience with it.Right when I clicked play I figured out that it's going to be bad in the best possible way the overall tone is dark from the beginning and the way the camera and the sound are used adds a lot to the avantgarde note of Seul contre Tous.The introduction of the main character is how it needs to be right when we see and hear The Butcher we know that he could be anyone from your hard working Neighbor to your best friend.Philippe Nahon does an amazing job portraying that totally degenerated guy that seems so normal to his outside world he's so good that you lose yourself seeing and hearing him it's a constant conflict between understanding and hating him between judging him and hoping he'll find his good side even though that hope leaves pretty fast.And that is why I love Seul contre Tous it's not about a super villain that wants to destroy the world it's not about a hero that fights his inner demons but it's also not about a cold blooded murderer it's about a desperate and angry sicko that is about to break lose and even though he's stuck in a relateable situation what he makes out of it is what makes him one of the most sinister characters I've ever seen.If you want to see something new intelligent or evil this is your movie!".

I had seen Irreversible and was actually afraid of seeing this movie because of not knowing what to expect. Anyway I loved it. It rings so true to the thoughts of most of us... truly we see in his racing thoughts the angry mentality that takes over us when the social structure conspires to crush our spirits. Unemployed in a relationship with an ugly demanding woman who has furthered the walls around him by carrying his child away from the only person he loves his daughter aging with nothing to show for it flat broke and immersed in a system only preoccupied with appeasing the rich and ostracizing the poor. Of course it generates anger and the blame definitely needs to be attributed to someone. Now in the case of our friend he shows very strongly how information overload leads to stagnation it almost becomes a matter of survival for him to turn life into something monochromatic some action of his must be undertaken in order to effectively change. Playing the game according to the system has failed him. The movie has a lot of inner dialog and if you're like me and don't speak French you will be reading very quickly. This definitely reflects the manic state he is in he concretely projects his aggression into external objects and takes action accordingly seen when he kills his unborn child still in the womb. It unravels into a psychotic state when he becomes delusional about what he needs to do in order to save himself and his handicapped daughter. They must both die so they can truly be free so they can truly fuse as one. At this point an advisory notice comes onto the screen stating you have 30 seconds to leave the screening. This is definitely anxietyprovoking for anyone. What follows is definitely disturbing. His daughter is shot from behind the bullet hole piercing through her neck and she lies on the floor writhing bleeding from the orifice resembling the slaughtering of a cow or horse the image that came to me was of the horse at the beginning of Carne and he as well states that animals usually die faster and he can't stand to see her suffer like that. The analogy to irrational beasts is more evident with the fact that she does not speak thus contorts and dies as a nonverbal creature would. The concreteness of his outside projections becomes more limited and he decides killing the man who didn't give him a job was less important than carrying out the main plan. In essence by reenacting his past profession and thus the definition of his life in that moment he literally kills off the 2 key aspects of his existence to date with the 2nd shot he destroys the image of the slaughtered contorting animal which he can no longer stand to watch and he kills his daughter his link to happiness and the only thing truly keeping him in this world. Thus she is shot in the head. He deliberates for a long time before turning the gun on himself and committing suicide thus destroying the 2nd part of his psyche the castrated version of himself that no longer has any real reason to remain alive. Eventually we see this was all engendered by his imagination and he decides to seek the socalled fusion with his daughter in a sublimated form having sex a more attractive alternative which also allows psychic survival. After this there is something of a reverse Oedipal role she is the motherfigure consoling the crying baby and the boundaries of the forbidden incestuous relationship are shattered thus he can find peace. All in all an excellent film. Don't compare it to Irreversible they have exceedingly distinct messages.. there do seem to be allusions to it many references to tunnels as well as to Noe's new film in the mentioning of the great void of death. Highly recommended this man is a genius.".

All I know is that I feel extremely alone and weird at the moment independent of anything going on in my life. In that way I think the film did its job. To an extent the main character is so sick and jaded that one doesn't exactly relate to him or identify with the character. At the same time however for those of us that don't experience life as rosy and joyous all the time there is an element of utter pessimism that one can relate to. In a traditional sense not that much actually happens in this movie. The majority of it is filled with an inner dialogue and scenes of people just sitting around.I suppose it's odd for me to say that I like this film but as I said I think it did its job. The soundtrack was well done and the acting was thoroughly convincing. If you can deal with depressing and disturbing movies I'd give I Stand Alone a shot. If not rent Big and go to bed feeling nostalgic and hopeful about the future.".

	schema:headline " Incredible film from Gaspar Noe. Powerful disturbing unique important and won't leave the viewer alone.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film from French film maker Gaspar Noe is true piece of art and is so full of message content and cinematic elements that it will definitely not leave the viewer alone after the first viewing no more than after the future viewings. The butcher is living in a hell as his life has been destroyed he has lost almost everything and all the people around him are bad bad and even more bad and wicked. The butcher does not have a reason to live and continue his life among this filth. He has only one thing that has kept him alive and given him power and little motivation his retarded and institution based daughter. What follows during the movie's running time is a plethora of cynicism hate disgust and depravity presented in a methods of cinema.The film is full of more than dark visions of humanity and society in which nothing is kind or likable and everyone is selfish evil and worth nothing. The people around the butcher are stupid mean spirited and know nothing about loving and caring and the whole vision of life and world is one of the darkest I've ever witnessed in film. Similar experiences among cinema are Pier Paolo Pasolini's Sal o le 120 Giornate di Sodoma Buddy Giovinazzo's Combat Shock Scorsese's Taxi Driver and T.F Mous' extremely hard to take Men Behind the Sun. These films are similar in theme and all are very hard to take and understand for most of the people and powerful experiences. Why are things this way? What is wrong with us that the world cannot be safe and warm place to live and why there is a need for suicide and death. Why can't the world be such a place that everyone wants to live and no one tries to kill and finish someone other's life? These mentioned films and similar films which I didn't mention are perhaps the most important there is because they punch even stupid people right on the face and grab their attention and show the real faces of things. Seul Contre Tous is a kind of film which may change people's attitudes and ways of living and that is probably the greatest achievement a film maker can reach with his work.The methods and cinematic magic used in Seul Contre Tous is something never before seen. The editing extremely ominous the gun shots at the soundtrack the monologue by the protagonist the little amount of actual dialogue the use of colors and the texts appearing in the screen and the warning at the end are something that I had never seen before and they totally blew me away and left me speechless. How can a movie be this effective? It won't leave you alone and it appears again and again in your mind days after the watching. Last time in my case I felt such a cinematic punch when I viewed Darren Aronofsky's superb and incredible A Requiem for a Dream which is similar in effect with Noe's film. The answer for the question how artmovie can be this powerful is of course the talent in these film makers which so often and sadly tends to be neglected because of Hollywood mainstream productions and the large entertainment business. But it does not matter because these artists can work and make films despite what mainstream thinks and prefers. I think that these mentioned films are almost as effective and perfect as any movie can be. It doesn't matter what large audience thinks because all they want is to have fun and eat pop corn and they would not understand a bit about these important movies.There is absolutely nothing optimistic in this film although the end scene is not as pessimistic as the rest of the film and is actually even optimistic but I naturally won't spoil how this one ends. The end sums the director's conclusion and the butcher's conclusion and despite the viewer being totally numbed with realistic terror at that point it forces to think and think hard. There is a way towards brighter and better world and as far as there is a will to help alter and love there is also a way to do it and express it. I want also note that this film is definitely not for a casual viewer as this is so hard to take due to its extremely nihilistic attitudes thoughts and imagery both violent and sexual so these challenging elements are too much for most of the people so don't even try to watch if you feel uneasy with difficult and depressing material. I hate to read reviews from people who have seen this and having understood nothing about it they only abuse and express their loathing for the film without even trying to understand its real points and merits. This is always the case with art cinema and especially difficult art cinema because people usually don't want to interpret and don't want to think during a movie and after it. This is not entertainment so mainstream fanaticspopcorn eaters stay far away!And for last but definitely not least I want to mention one particular element which is one of the most original and unforgettable I've ever seenA slight spoiler aheadBefore the notorious end scene and bursting there is is a warning which says that there is 30 seconds time to leave the theatre..At the same time a the butcher speaks and indicates that what will happen and what is his conclusion. And then the end scene begins and there is no chance to get out of theatre anymore...It has to be experienced because it gives so ominous and powerful effect to the film and to what will follow. And what follows is really shocking and inconsolable. The scene itself is brutal in mental but also in graphic way but is never gratuitous or needless.no spoilers anymore!That end scene reminded me of Takashi Miike's incredible masterpiece Audition which also has one of the greatest endings and disturbing moments in the history of cinema. Audition and Seul Contre Tous are very different films in content but both share the magnificent talent and use of cinematic techniques and both are very important achievements for their makers.I hope that this writing doesn't sound too praising and I have tried to make this as closely argued and explained as possible. Seul Contre Tous is Gaspar Noe's masterpiece and I hope that he can continue his work in this field and make more this kind of personal provoking and definitely challenging cinema.10 bright stars for Seul Contre Tous and its creator the great artist Gaspar Noe.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film from French film maker Gaspar Noe is true piece of art and is so full of message content and cinematic elements that it will definitely not leave the viewer alone after the first viewing no more than after the future viewings. The butcher is living in a hell as his life has been destroyed he has lost almost everything and all the people around him are bad bad and even more bad and wicked. The butcher does not have a reason to live and continue his life among this filth. He has only one thing that has kept him alive and given him power and little motivation his retarded and institution based daughter. What follows during the movie's running time is a plethora of cynicism hate disgust and depravity presented in a methods of cinema.The film is full of more than dark visions of humanity and society in which nothing is kind or likable and everyone is selfish evil and worth nothing. The people around the butcher are stupid mean spirited and know nothing about loving and caring and the whole vision of life and world is one of the darkest I've ever witnessed in film. Similar experiences among cinema are Pier Paolo Pasolini's Sal o le 120 Giornate di Sodoma Buddy Giovinazzo's Combat Shock Scorsese's Taxi Driver and T.F Mous' extremely hard to take Men Behind the Sun. These films are similar in theme and all are very hard to take and understand for most of the people and powerful experiences. Why are things this way? What is wrong with us that the world cannot be safe and warm place to live and why there is a need for suicide and death. Why can't the world be such a place that everyone wants to live and no one tries to kill and finish someone other's life? These mentioned films and similar films which I didn't mention are perhaps the most important there is because they punch even stupid people right on the face and grab their attention and show the real faces of things. Seul Contre Tous is a kind of film which may change people's attitudes and ways of living and that is probably the greatest achievement a film maker can reach with his work.The methods and cinematic magic used in Seul Contre Tous is something never before seen. The editing extremely ominous the gun shots at the soundtrack the monologue by the protagonist the little amount of actual dialogue the use of colors and the texts appearing in the screen and the warning at the end are something that I had never seen before and they totally blew me away and left me speechless. How can a movie be this effective? It won't leave you alone and it appears again and again in your mind days after the watching. Last time in my case I felt such a cinematic punch when I viewed Darren Aronofsky's superb and incredible A Requiem for a Dream which is similar in effect with Noe's film. The answer for the question how artmovie can be this powerful is of course the talent in these film makers which so often and sadly tends to be neglected because of Hollywood mainstream productions and the large entertainment business. But it does not matter because these artists can work and make films despite what mainstream thinks and prefers. I think that these mentioned films are almost as effective and perfect as any movie can be. It doesn't matter what large audience thinks because all they want is to have fun and eat pop corn and they would not understand a bit about these important movies.There is absolutely nothing optimistic in this film although the end scene is not as pessimistic as the rest of the film and is actually even optimistic but I naturally won't spoil how this one ends. The end sums the director's conclusion and the butcher's conclusion and despite the viewer being totally numbed with realistic terror at that point it forces to think and think hard. There is a way towards brighter and better world and as far as there is a will to help alter and love there is also a way to do it and express it.

Never before have I felt so many shockingly complex thoughts and emotions being brought to the screen as vividly as director No has done here. I Stand Alone or One Against All is the sequel to the director's short film Carne1991 which is wonderfully summarized at the beginning with a photographic montage and breakneck narration. Here The Butcher Philippe Nanon has been released from jail and attempts to start a new life with his mistress. She has promised him a new butcher's shop in the small suburb where they move to but soon finds out that she has lied to him. Thusly he decides to go back to Paris and reconnect with his daughter. No spares none of the encyclopedia of film technique which he so obviously holds and creates a film of immense intelligence that deserves to be viewed and discussed. The Butcher's haunting voice over carries the film and viewer into the mind of a deeply troubled Frenchman punctuated with well executed outbursts of violence. Philippe Nanon reprises this role at the beginning of No's follow up film Irreversible2002. This is a film that will violate the viewer and their beliefs a film that is seldom made and seldom matched. We truly need more films like this which force the viewer to confront and refine their beliefs. WARNING You have 30 seconds to leave the screening of this film. S".

	schema:reviewBody "When I finished I Stand Alone I got up and looked into the mirror. My mind still racing from the intense final act. I looked at myself and muttered why. Why does this type of film exist. Why do I seek out and watch these types of movies. Why. I've got answers for both now. Movies like this exist because they have to and because there is disturbed film makers like Noe out there willing to put together this kind of art.The reason I seek out these movies is also another reason as to why they exist. To invoke thought and emotion. I have seen a murderers row of shocking disturbing cinema. From Serbian Film to Ken Park all the way down to Salo if it fits the sub genre I've likely seen it. I Stand Alone is not only one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen it's one of the most disturbing disturbing movies I've ever seen. The Butcher is such a piece of sht mentally ill and disturbed character. I never once felt sorry for him or felt anything aside from hate towards him. He's an example of some of the worst human garbage on the planet and you have to take a step back and say people like him actually exist which makes me want to vomit. Whether he is speaking about how meaningless and shitty life is or pummeling his unborn child to death The Butcher is scum. I Stand Alone can surely come across as a meaningless pretentious shock piece with no message or merit aside from look at how vile this movie is. I can completely understand this opinion and would not argue with someone who held it. I would say yes it is a drama but really it's a horror movie. At the very least its sometimes horrific. The final act begins with a warning telling audiences to leave the theater and hit the road. I kind of wish I took this advice. This part is an unrelenting look into the mind of a madman and his sadistic ramblings and acts as well as some heinous gore. I can say surely that I will never revisit this movie and if you'd like a free DVD copy of it feel free to message me and you can take mine off my hands. That being said it should be seen by any... I don't know hardcore film fan? It's a good movie but it's also a bad movie if that makes sense. I'm giving it a 7 which is about as high as I go for this type of film.".

I probably don't even realize how sick and perverted that sounds right now and if I ever have a daughter I promise I will kick myself in the nuts for what I am about to write but having to put up with so much crap for so long has to result in something drastic Here is a man who decides no to act on his revenge only for his mute daughter's sake he was two steps away from killing her but after visualizing her gruesome death he chickened out yet in exchange for this he feels that he can have sex with her. And he does so because deep down in his mind he doesn't feel he's doing something wrong he feels that this is his reward. So how sick am I for actually thinking that he isn't that bad a person for reasoning with himself the way he does.Most of the movie isn't nearly as depressing and extreme it is a showcase of great and groundbreaking cinematography Noe's next movie Irreversible however manages to take another step forward that is simply put light years from even this one  how he manages this is an enigma to marvel astounding acting and narrating Phillipe Nahon has my deepest respect and admiration  the scene where you actually see his eyes shouting out that he is about to kill his daughter leaves a person in awe and the screenplay is both dead funny and dead serious at the same time so the movie leaves you feeling mixed emotions all the way. Love the sound that breaks the scenes and love Noe's storytelling abilities. Somehow he managed not to make me feel down although the subject of the movie is very serious and even more so sad. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Going into I Stand Alone I was only aware of one thing that it was made by Gaspar Noe the director of the incredibly memorable Irreversible. This is his first outing as a director and I personally think it's one of the best debuts in movie history.The story basically follows a desperate desperate man who is losing his grip on life. Growing up an orphan working hard his entire life only to succumb to poor luck. From unhealthy relationships to bankruptcy and unsuccessful job hunts. Nothing is going his way. You basically just follow him around and listen to his thoughts while he tries to set things on the right path. Mostly it's him speaking his voice on how much he dislikes things or what he thinks of suchandsuch. But his constant pessimism always seems to ring true in a certain way. Not always but more often than not. And this is where the movie shines brightest. The writing is fantastic. Simple situations blended with great realistic writing. And having great performances by all actors doesn't hurt either.I Stand Alone is the second film I've seen by Mr. Noe and again I came out very pleased. With Irreversible he shocked us with some amazingly realistic scenes. And again I Stand Alone doesn't shy away from the horror of realistic situations that happen from time to time in our world. And like Irreversible the scenes are also very memorable and controversial. With such great writing acting and direction this is a movie that most serious filmgoers should definitely check out. It's a slow moving film but with insightful and interesting themes popping up quite often. I really didn't know exactly what to think of Gaspar Noe as a filmmaker after Irreversible but I'm certainly one of his fans now. Check this out if you're looking for a unique flick.".

For that reason I found this movie to be terrible and disgusting and with a hateful horrible message.This is by no means a good film not even a decent one. It was directed by Gaspar Noe who also made the equally bad Irreversible. I hated both films. I don't recommend this film to anyone.

She has lived there most of her life except for a short stint in London thirtyseven years ago following the vicious murder of her married lover John Mayhew at the plantation's summer house while Sam was hosting one of his legendary grand balls in the mansion. She and John had planned to run off together that night but instead he was bludgeoned to death his head and right hand severed from his body. Nobody was ever convicted for his murder but most people believe Charlotte did it after John changed his mind about running off with her.

	schema:reviewBody "Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte was as most people know intended as a follow up not a sequel to the first and most influential horror hag film of them all Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?. Producerdirector Robert Aldrich who had helmed Jane wanted to repeat that film's box office success. He reteamed Bette Davis as Charlotte and Joan Crawford as her cousin Miriam but in events that have become the stuff of Hollywood Legend Crawford became ill and checked into the hospital and wouldn't come out. She was eventually replaced by Bette's longstanding friend Olivia de Havilland fresh from Lady in a Cage 1964. Although many find the plot somewhat convoluted it is basically rather simple. Aging southern belle Charlotte Hollis lives in decayed splendor in the Louisiana mansion where thirty seven years earlier a horrible murder took place. The victim was none other than her married lover John Mayhew Bruce Dern in an early screen appearance whom Charlotte fears was killed by her overbearing father Victor Buono who was against their affair. Over the years however the local townspeople have concluded that Charlotte herself was responsible but escaped punishment due to her father's political connections. As it happens the highway commission is planning on building a bridge where Charlotte's house stands and are tirelessly trying to remove her from the property. She is just as doggedly determined to remain because she fears demolition of the house will reveal proof of her father's guilt. Charlotte's only companions are her old white trash housekeeper Velma Crother Agnes Moorehead and the family doctor Drew Bayliss Joseph Cotten. Charlotte's attempts to hold off the sheriff are finally beginning to weaken so in a last attempt to hold onto the old plantation she sends for her Cousin Miriam Deering hoping she can help. Miriam does eventually arrive but it's soon obvious that she is there for reasons other than to comfort and aid her cousin.The film is well photographed in eminently suitable black and white and the haunting musical score by an Oscarnominated Frank DeVol as well as the beautiful nominated title song aid it immeasurably. The performances are what makes the movie so much fun. Bette Davis as usual goes all out as the tormented cousin moaning whining simpering andespecially shrieking her way through her part. In contrast the still very attractive de Havilland is at first a model of restraint. Matching Davis in the histrionics department is Moorehead who was also Oscarnominated for her performance as she carries on sometimes so hilariously it's difficult to understand what she is saying. Oh well that's what DVD subtitles are for! At the same time she can be moving as well. Cotten gets to do his own relatively restrained scenerychewing  but the scenes in which Davis de Havilland and Moorehead scream at each other in very thick southern accents could be right out of the old Mama's Family TV series. As Jewel Mayhew widow of Bette's lover Mary Astor gives her usual excellent performance so subdued and realistic that she seems to be in a different film. Ditto Cecil Kellaway as a curious insurance investigator. In the end though it's all the overplaying and gaudy scene stealing which makes Charlotte so much fun. A remake would be not only redundant but a mistake. Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte is truly one of a kind. The justreleased Fox DVD includes a great widescreen transfer of the film an audio commentary and best of all a trailer teaser trailer and three television spots which emphasize the movie's lurid aspectswhat else could you want? GET IT NOW!".

It's the Southern setting that gives the film its potent flavor with that overwrought plantation house the Southern accents the small town gossip antebellum attitudes and the music at the party in 1927. The script's dialogue also reflects this Southern tint. Mournfully reflecting on the past Sam Hollis Victor Buono says near the beginning My daddy sat out there on that veranda let this whole place slide to dust when he died there was nothing but debts and dirt I touched that dirt and made it blossom.The story's theme is a preoccupation with the past with ghosts not properly buried and with family secrets repression and subterfuge. Charlotte Bette Davis is a pitiful woman because she is not rational. Like her daddy she can't let go of the past. Living all alone in that big house with just her housekeeper Velma Agnes Moorehead Charlotte obsesses about bygone days. But if her own delusions contribute to her misery she at least has the presence of mind to understand that those who come to visit her may not have her best interests in mind hence the story's conflict as she attempts to fight back.All of the major roles are ideally cast. I would not have made a single change in casting. Acting trends a tad melodramatic at times but that's part of the fun. Agnes Moorehead gives one of the great supporting performances of all time. And Olivia de Havilland with her vocal inflections shrewd smile and stylish behavior adds elegance that contrasts nicely with the shabby and humorously uncultured Velma.BW cinematography also contributes to the film's high quality. Dramatic lighting interesting overhead camera angles lots of interior shadows and quick zoomins all add visual interest.Plot structure is okay but the runtime is a bit lengthy. I wish they had edited out some of the campy scenes in the second half.Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte is a grand movie with grand actors and grand moments. The story contains mystery spinetingling suspense and it veritably drips with Southern angst. Though the film is a tad campy in a few spots and is a bit long nevertheless it's wonderfully entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few films have the ability to show the decay of plantation life in the South better than Hush...Hush sweet Charlotte.  The setting is a rural plantation home that in 1927 was the scene of a brutal murder where an unfaithful husband was beheaded and behanded.  Next we fast forward to 1964 and see the effects of this crime on Charlotte Hollis..the young girl accused of the crime and bordering on mental instability.  Bette Davis plays Charlotte and her performance is a tourdeforce as she plays a woman under stress with a zeal that would make any ham actor proud.  Davis tops her baby Jane performance by not only creating a character with obvious problems but also giving this character feeling compassion and an air of pity.  The plot of the film involves Davis's descent into madness as she thinks she sees things..or really does.  The rest of the cast is firstrate with Joseph Cotten playing the stereotypical Southern doctor with the overpronounced inflection only Cotten could provide.  Olivia De Havilland creates one of her better roles and makes a superb wicked woman.  The real treat to watch is Agnes Moorehead who plays a wisecracking crotchetey housekeeper. Rounding out the superb cast are a few  nice performances from the ever affable Cecil Kellaway as one of the few humane people in the film a nice cameo by Mary Astor Bruce Dern and Victor Buono in flashback sequences. The movie tells a pretty inventive tale...but really is a showcase for great talent good direction wonderful atmosphere and a rather perverse thematic underpinning.  To use a wellworn cliche....they just don't make em like this anymore.  Ain't it a shame!".

Bette Davis was in her element in this role of Charlotte while Olivia de Havilland in the role originally planned for Joan Crawford was superb and was an inspired piece of accidental casting! Agnes Moorehead deserved her Academy nomination while Mary Astor was a most welcome sight. Joseph Cotten normally seems very wooden in his parts but does an excellent job here. The Black and White photography adds a great deal to the mood and is far better than Colour would have been. The ending was very well planned and carried out and you feel after the film ends there is something else that happened that the viewer never saw. Get it on Video  it is well worth the experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Mayhew Bruce Dern a married man is having an affair with Charlotte Hollis Bette Davis. When Charlotte's father Sam Victor Buono a local bigwig the town is even named after the family finds out that John was planning on eloping with Charlotte he demands that John tells Charlotte during a big party that he's breaking off their relationship. John ends up dead and Charlotte is the likely suspect. Thirtyseven years later Charlotte is still living as a recluse on her family's plantation but now she is being forced to move as a highway is going to be built across her property. Gradually people come back into her life to ostensibly help her.For at least the first 45 minutes to an hour or so into the film Hush . . . Hush Sweet Charlotte is a 10 out of 10. Unfortunately given a 133minute running time director Robert Aldrich can't sustain the intensity for the length of the film but Hush . . . Hush Sweet Charlotte finishes as an 8 out of 10 for me.Although there are some thriller and horror elements both take up relatively little screen time. At that though these elements are extremely effective. Some parts are surprisingly graphic for 1964just enough to be a surprise and evoke the appropriate sense of shock. The best horrorthriller material in the film is in the haunted house vein and for a time we wonder if Hush . . . Hush Sweet Charlotte is going to end up being a ghost story.But the focus here is primarily on Charlotte and Miriam Deering Olivia de Havilland and their relationship to one another. Davis and de Havilland are both incredible in the film and both go through a very wide range of emotions. Oddly Agnes Moorehead as Velma Cruther was more recognized for her performance than the rest of the cast in terms of awards and nominations with de Havilland receiving neither. Not that Moorehead wasn't good but in my view she wasn't the standout performance. However that's just further fuel for my belief that the Academy Awards have little to do with rewarding the best films actors and filmmakers.There are also broader themes explored as a subtext including the changing way of life in the southern United States between the early and mid20th Century.I subtracted two points because the film lost a bit of its momentum and direction in the middle but the last halfhour is as exciting as the beginning.".

Or could it have been the overprotective servant Agnes Moorehead in an Academy Awardnominated performance? Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte is an engrossing film about the ruthless machinations of Miriam Deering Olivia de Havilland and her doctor lover Joseph Cotten as they try to push her cousin the disturbed Charlotte Bette Davis over the edge in order to get Charlotte's inheritance.  Blackmail and deceit abound in this psychological suspense drama which exceeded my expectations much better than the cheap blood and gore that I thought it would be. Bette's performance was at times heartbreaking sometimes humorous and mostly macabre. One of the better performances she gave towards the end of her career. Olivia de Havilland gave a chilling performance as a scheming vicious vindicator of envy...a long cry from her roles as the good woman in such films as To Each His Own and In This Our Life. The film made me sit up and watch some scary bits some humour some malevolent emotions. All very exciting. Very well executed. Very much worth watching when you're in the mood for something highly entertaining.".

Cecil Kellaway Harry Willis and Mary Astor Jewel Mayhew are pale appearance as a homing pigeon and an eternal enemy.This is not bad ... not at all.";

She was excellent as the eccentric but very perceptive housekeeper. I wish Kellaway's role had been bigger. It was interesting too to see such a young Dern. Davis looked really grotesque but that was the idea. Kudos for her to not care about her looks.Speaking of looks the best feature in here might have been the cinematography. I have not seen this on DVD but I'd like to and wonder if it looks tremendous. It sure looked good on VHS. And that theme song! It is played throughout the movie and once you hear it as I first did in the theater over 40 years ago you never forget it.My lone complaint is the length of the film. At 133 minutes I think it would have been a lot tighter and better at about 110. However even though there were definite lulls in the story they were never that long in length.".

When the state condemns her home to put in a new highway she defiantly refuses to leave with a shotgun. When her longlost Yankee cousin Miriam arrives to help heads start to roll literally. Although not a sequel to Whatever Happened to Baby Jane it was conceived as a vehicle to reteam Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. And the story is similar in that the parts were written as Crazy Bette and Phony Joan as Davis put it. Too bad Davis drove Crawford off the picture. For details read Bette and Joan The Divine Feud by Shaun Considine. It would've been great to see them do battle again this time with Crawford having the upper hand. And the scene when Joan slaps Bette would've been cinematic history.Still I enjoy Charlotte more than Jane. For one thing it has the delightfully grotesque Agnes Moorehead acting like Quasimodo as Charlotte's screwy allyservant Velma. She steals every scene she's in and an Oscar nomination and I'm surprised Davis allowed it. It's also nice to see sweetfaced Olivia DeHavilland cast against type as Miriam. She handles herself quite well and god knows it couldn't have been easy for her. When Crawford heard that she was out and DeHavilland was in she ranted against Davis and director Robert Aldrich in the press but cooed I'm happy for Olivia she needs a good movie role. Ouch. And after the picture was completed Queen Bette said Olivia was good at keeping the audience's attention while I'm off screen. With friends like her....By the way there is a long shot of Crawford still in the movie. Look for it when Miriam gets out of the taxi after arriving at the plantation house. That's actually the back of Joan's head not Olivia's.".

It's got a great cast and gives Olivia de Havilland her first taste at playing a real bitch the car scene where Miriam de Havilland slaps Charlotte is fantastic! It's hard for me to think that Joan Crawford was cast in the original role of Miriam only because de Havilland brings such a refinement to the character. She's wellmannered classy and eloquent which makes it that much better when she finally snaps.Agnes Moorehead is a hoot playing Velma and while her whole character is a tad overexaggerated the true caring she had for Miss Charlotte is nice to see. As always Joseph Cotten is great as Dr. Drew Bayliss and unlike his other roles he doesn't underplay this one. I enjoy the chemistry between him and de Havilland in their scenes together particularly in the one after Velma's death. The black and white cinematography is wonderfulgiving the whole film a moody creepy look. The whole movie leans towards the category of campy bitchfests but what a fantastic campy bitchfest it is! 'Charlotte' is always labeled under horror but the scene where Bruce Dern is murdered always makes me laugh. Compared to today's gore standards this one is the equivalent of a paper cut!1010. And personally I found 'Charlotte' much more interesting than Baby Jane which just rubbed me the wrong way I think I spent a good half of that movie just staring at Joan Crawfords eyebrows. Come on Fox! Get going on a DVD!".

	schema:reviewBody "There is an ominous feeling about this movie even its title which seems to go out of its way to seem like it truly has soul and communicates with us. Its story is very sad. Bette Davis nearly melts down from the heat of her own presence as a wealthy spinster who lives in a big mansion on a plantation that has interminably been in her family. The Highway Commission plans to level her home and build a new highway through the estate. Davis playing the titular Charlotte disregards the eviction notice and refuses to leave feeling that it is all she has in the world. She demonstrates her feelings by keeping the demolition crew and the bulldozer away by shooting at them. They finally give up and leave temporarily.The movie rather than opening with cursive credit titles and interchangeable orchestral music starts immediately set many years earlier when Charlotte is still barely an adult and her married lover played by a very young Bruce Dern is murdered in a stunning scene for 1964. Although the killer was never discovered the local townspeople and director Robert Wise's camera are persuaded of Charlotte's guilt. Charlotte has since become a recluse a black sheep of the community living with her housekeeper Agnes Moorehead in the fading mansion. Now she tries to find support in her struggle against the Highway Commission from Olivia de Havilland playing her cousin who lived with the family as a girl. Upon her return she refreshes her relationship with a local doctor who jilted her after the murder played by Joseph Cotton who flaunts a hugely persuasive Southern twang.Olivia de Havilland's performance is inordinately remarkable. She is an actress entirely opposite of Bette Davis. She is of incredible selfcontrol not only as an actress but as a woman. Her first instinct is to fight feelings smother restrain and simply not accept her outsized emotional condition. But in refusing to welcome innate unpredictability grief is only complicated but this is never overt. She masks this complexity in her irresistible feminine poise and beauty. She brings such incredible adjustments that slowly build upon one's comprehension of her character. Her looks her reactions her completely closeted feelings are knowingly real and natural. Robert Wise a master of realism in the most haunting contexts sees this as significant realistic gold and makes sure to steadily maintain its purity.Wise maintains purity in many areas of HushHush Sweet Charlotte. The evil for instance that is unraveled is unadulterated shocking cruelty heartlessness and sadism. The film is definitely scary in spite of the shock value it bears for its time. As a grand guignol sort of story it is a naturalistic horror tale a graphic amoral psychological drama. It is this kind of pure evil that really draws you in to a thriller. Wise's Gothic tale shot in a telling black and white has that draw and would not be out of place being performed in one of the turnof thecentury French theaters perhaps a converted chapel the theater's history shown in the confessionals angels and stain glass above the stage.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlotte Hollis Bette Davis at 56yo carries one of her heaviest roles as a wealthy unmarried Southerner who is socially outcast by neighbors of all agesincluding children making scandalizing rhymes about herbecause they believe she's responsible for the town's most notorious murder that of John Mayhew Bruce Dern her fianc' 40 years ago. A haggardly faithful servant Velma Cruther Agnes Moorehead at 64yo takes care of Charlotte since she's both so haunted by the ghost of Mayhew  so damned to reclusive isolation. The Hollis plantation is Charlotte's home that's been the family's prior to the Civil War. Because a highway is being built the Sheriff issues an eviction notice to Charlotte. Devastated by it she digs in her heels  refuses to leave. The rumor that she's crazy seems confirmed when Charlotte takes her father's rifle aims  shoots repeatedly at the workmen  foreman George Kennedy who approach the Hollis' property line all the while screaming at the top of her lungs to get off of her land. Charlotte sends for her only living relative a mildmannered cousin Miriam Deering Olivia de Havilland at 48yo because she believes she needs her help  influence to keep the Hollis plantation. Instead of mounting a legal battle to save Charlotte's home Miriam hires packers  orders Velma to assist her picking through the contents of Charlotte's home before Miriam fires Velma. Velma is a faithful servant to Miss Charlotte who sees straight through Miriam.

A haggardly faithful servant Velma Cruther Agnes Moorehead at 64yo takes care of Charlotte since she's both so haunted by the ghost of Mayhew  so damned to reclusive isolation. The Hollis plantation is Charlotte's home that's been the family's prior to the Civil War. Because a highway is being built the Sheriff issues an eviction notice to Charlotte. Devastated by it she digs in her heels  refuses to leave. The rumor that she's crazy seems confirmed when Charlotte takes her father's rifle aims  shoots repeatedly at the workmen  foreman George Kennedy who approach the Hollis' property line all the while screaming at the top of her lungs to get off of her land. Charlotte sends for her only living relative a mildmannered cousin Miriam Deering Olivia de Havilland at 48yo because she believes she needs her help  influence to keep the Hollis plantation. Instead of mounting a legal battle to save Charlotte's home Miriam hires packers  orders Velma to assist her picking through the contents of Charlotte's home before Miriam fires Velma. Velma is a faithful servant to Miss Charlotte who sees straight through Miriam. As Moorehead conveys Velma's suspicions  hatred of Miriam undoubtedly her facial expressions  silent gestures earn her the 1965 Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.

By today's Scream standards of course this sequence is tepid.  The value of watching this movie as many maybe most people will comment is the dialog and the performances.  Two of the supporting character performances are remarkable for two entirely different reasons. Agnes Morehead was roundly praised in 1964 for her performance in this movie and even got an Academy Award nomination.  It was however a completely misguided conceptualization that comes across as a racist Amos and Andy burlesque sketch.  The other performance is by Mary Astor as Jewel Mayhew.  This was Mary Astor's last performance in a movie and in her big scene with the actor Cecil Kellaway she is Oscarworthy.  With overthetop performances in no short supply in this picture it is understandable that Astor's marvel of delicacy and restraint hardly ever gets a mention.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1962 when the careers of acting heavyweights such as Bette Davis Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland were beginning to subside as the years took their toll director Robert Aldrich directed Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? a story of sibling jealousy and sadism that saw Davis and Crawford go head to head. The film was notorious not only for it's brilliance but for it's genuine rivalry between the film's two leads. The film was a success and unwittingly gave birth to a new genre that has since become known as 'hagspolitation' or 'psychobiddy thrillers' a splurge of films that usually portrayed a psychotic older woman played by a 194050's superstar. Davis and Crawford were the key players in the subgenre and they were both cast by Altman in his next film Hush... Hush Sweet Charlotte only for Crawford to drop out due to 'illness' when in reality it was because she just couldn't take Davis' bullying and general nasty behaviour. She was replaced by De Havilland and although the film doesn't come near to capturing the greatness of Baby Jane it is still a nice little shocker.Beginning with a shocking murder that sees a married man who is having an affair with Charlotte Davis have his arm and head hacked off with a huge cleaver the film jumps forward four decades where the ageing Charlotte lives alone in her giant mansion that is being torn down by city developers. Haunted by the murder of her former lover for which she may or may not have been the culprit Charlotte is losing her mind when her cousin Miriam De Havilland comes to stay to try and convince her to leave before she is arrested by the developers for failing to leave her home. What follows is Charlotte's fast decent into insanity but is she being played and manipulated by people after her vast fortune?The film is a solid horror film with some genuine shocks and extreme gore for its day. Of course the everreliable Bette Davis is superb as the squeakyvoice southern gal seemingly with the mind of an infant. Although the film works well as both a Southern Gothic horror and as a thriller the film doesn't have the intensity to last out the 2 hours and 15 minute running time and slightly outstays his welcome. But their is solid support from Joseph Cotten an actor who has never been recognised enough for his excellent body of work and Agnes Moorehead another main player in the genre.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

In the case of Crawford the result found her in some terrible movies while Davis went on to star in roles on TV and films. At the end of the series it discussed their reteaming under the same director Robert Aldrich for the film HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE. Their battle of wills resulted in Crawford being dismissed from the film and replaced by Olivia de Havilland and the film being completed. Why mention this? Because it provides an interesting backdrop when looking at the film now on bluray from Twilight Time.The movie opens in 1927 in the antebellum south with a party being held by Charlotte Hollis father Victor Buono. Charlotte has made plans to elope with her lover John Bruce Dern but before this takes place her father confronts John with the fact that he knows he is already married. Realizing he can't leave with Charlotte he breaks off with her. That same night someone takes a meat cleaver to John and Charlotte is thought to be behind the killing.The story moves forward to 1964. The grand old house is in ruins and Charlotte lives their almost alone an aging spinster with only Velma Agnes Moorehead there to keep her company. Times are worse than Charlotte realizes with the house set for demolition since a new highway is to be built here. Charlotte confronts the construction crew armed and after the sheriff intervenes is given days to move out.Seeking help Charlotte has convinced her cousin Miriam de Havilland to return and help her. Arriving from New York Miriam does her best renewing her romance with local doctor Drew Bayliss Joseph Cotton and trying to help. But as the days pass it seems that Charlotte may have gone mad over the ensuing years since Miriam left. She sees images of John at night and fears that her father the man she thought murdered John all those years ago is back as well.Something isn't quite right here and we as viewers know it. Velma does her best to keep Charlotte calm and suspects that something is amiss. But just who is behind it we're not sure. Was John really murdered all those years ago? Did Charlotte actually do it and now is racked with guilt over her actions? Or is there some other mystery long buried over the years that is only now playing out? The film offers a solid Gothic style mystery one where a number of potential solutions are presented. Davis performance would seem a bit on the hammy side if it weren't for the fact that the method she employs here adds credulity to the character of Charlotte and her eccentric ways. Aldrich who moved on to bigger and better films like THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX THE DIRTY DOZEN and THE LONGEST YARD does a great job of bringing his cast together to offer performances that are among their best.If you read my reviews you may tire of hearing me saying this but yes Twilight Time has brought a great looking offering here with a fantastic looking print. They've done a great job with extras this time around as well which include an isolated score track audio commentary track with film historians David Del Vale and Steven Peros audio commentary track with film historian Glenn Erickson HUSHHUSH SWEET JOAN THE MAKING OF CHARLOTTE BRUCE DERN REMEMBERS Wizard Work TV spots and the original theatrical trailers. As always it's limited to just 3000 copies so if you want one order today.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I don't understand how was missed  you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film. The first time I saw it I just said well mistakes happen and brushed it off. After about the 10th time it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. If you haven't seen the film yet try counting how many times you see the microphone might make for pretty interesting game.Now about the film. This movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid ghost story however the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely. You begin watching the movie under the assumption alluded by the TV commercials that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children particularly young children which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger. The opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film. SPOILER The movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force in the home. The idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar. The young boy also witnesses this supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed. After his family is killed the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as well.As I said this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a twoyearold. This began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well completely ruining the only children can see illusion set forth by the commercials and opening scene.Regardless of this the movie didn't actually get ruined until the plot twist at the end. In which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie. All of a sudden after being attacked by a swarm of crows the man snaps and tries to kill the mother daughter and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be HIS family which he killed at the beginning.The whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf. First why was the family's souls trapped in a house? If the director was going for a JuOn The Grudge approach in which the family after dying in a fit of rage would haunt the house and kill whoever enters why did the haunting stop after the father was captured by the ghosts of his family? If the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them why were they attacking the new family? Here's another one for you. It takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest. This tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie was living on the property for months. During all this time why didn't the ghosts just go kill him? This movie included a lot of clichd horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. However I'm telling ya this movie still could've pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end. It's like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending. For this movie to have been a success they should've stuck with the only children can see them premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning would've opened the door for possible sequeltoo.".

The first time I saw it I just said well mistakes happen and brushed it off. After about the 10th time it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny.

Not all thriller movies can be the best  and this one is not one of the best you'll ever see. But that's no reason to slam it quite so badly. There have to be a bunch of movies that are in the average range obviously not all movies can be the best. This one is definitely in the average range  BUT it's one of the better average thrillers you'll come across. The reason it's in the upper levels of average is because it's directed by the Pang Brothers. They are responsible for The Eye and Bangkok Dangerous and their brilliant stamp is all over this little thriller. Take notice of how beautifully framed each scene is the effective use of silence throughout the play on colours  textures the minimalist dialogue etc. It's beautifully filmed and well acted by all but the mother character and it creates a lovely tense atmosphere with plenty of scares and spooks but no blood and guts  so that will disappoint some. The biggest problem with the movie is the screenplay itself. It's not the most riveting story in the world  the plot has several flaws like so many thrillers do. But it doesn't matter in the hands of the Pangs this taut little thriller still a far better movie than most and easily worth the rental. Just don't go into it expecting the next best thing. It is what it is. An average but gripping movie.".

Only once or twice they jump into 'Saw' territory. But even having not seen the majority of the Japanese horror movies that have give rise to the overabundance of 'ghostsinmyhouse' wave and likewise to their American counterparts there isn't too much with surprise or shocks in The Messengers. I'm sure they're selfconscious of the films they're paying homageripping off the one scene involving the crows and their rendezvous with John Corbett's character is like a chummier mash of The Birds and North by Northwest Shining and Close Encounters references seem a little more than clear to me too yet they also succumb to having their film be really affectless. It's never too stupid though I didn't have a disliking toward any one character with the exception being maybe towards the end with Corbett I don't think I'm spoiling much there and it's the sort of typical familymovesintoacreepyhouse story that decides to hit the usual bases without going rapidly wrong on the marks.But there's also the muddle that comes in dealing with the supernatural side of things amid the average scares of 'what did I hear in the other room I'll go check'. For one thing the variations on who the ghosts and demons in the house are if they're the family that used to live there or if they might be the whatevers that killed off the family striking back at the new family in the house. There's fair acting from the family Kristen Stewart of Panic Room fills in the teenagegirl niche and there's competent work from McDermott and Miller Colbert is a little creepy but I guess that's the point William B. Davis's bit part is the best real surprise of the movie but it's all at the mercy of a standard script that might've been better damn if I say it as a half hour TV episode or something. Only sometimes too are there some potential unintentional laughs to be had mostly towards the climax and with the very randomly placed crows that can only come in a pretty inexplicable flick such as this. In the end the Messengers is nothing new and won't contribute much at all to the horror genre at large but I wouldn't throw it in my 'I hate this movie so much' bin either as it only continues to that nonthreatening realm of the kindacreepy PG13 haunted house picture.".

A man who shows up out of nowhere John Corbett to work at the farm and the family becomes pretty close with him as well. But the increasingly frightening supernatural experiences that only Jess seems to see get more and more violent and seem to have a relation to something that happened in the house years ago.With some obvious similarities to The Grudge and just about every ghost story you can think of The Messengers is an extremely derivative ghost tale that manages to hold itself up without becoming unbearably watchable. The story itself is your typical hauntedhouse yarn  family moves into house strange experiences begin that can only be seen by the children or our main character seems to have a relation to a horrible incident that happened in the house years before. Full of dark and shadowy rooms ghostlike figures with ridiculously orchestrated jerky movements reminiscent of The Grudge mostly useless jump scares and a small child character who can see things others can't The Messengers is clichd no doubting that. I wasn't afraid once during this film because I knew when to expect all of the scary moments. Maybe it's because I've seen films like this one too many times but all I can say for sure is that I didn't find this film scary.While this film is heavily clichd which is probably it's strongest negative point I still managed to enjoy the majority of it. While the story is typical it managed to keep my attention and I was at least interested. The cinematography really soared in this film. Everything was very nice looking and the atmosphere was great. The backdrop of the house and the surrounding land really made it feel like it was in the complete middle of nowhere and the old house itself while it was your typical haunted house was admittedly spooky looking. The acting was really good for the most part. Kristen Stewart is the lead and is very talented and convincing. I'd previously seen her in Panic Room at a younger age and even then she was good. I can see her going places. Dylan McDermott and John Corbett are both very good as well and Penelope Ann Miller while not giving the best performance of the cast was decent enough. I can't say anything too horrible about the acting though.Overall The Messengers is your typical clichridden modern ghost story and it borrows so much from other recent films of it's type which a lot of these films seem to do that it becomes another one of those we've seen it all before horror movies. It doesn't offer much of anything new for the genre but it was at least watchable. If you want some cheap scares and a very few number of eerie moments you'll probably enjoy this. But mostly this film is one big clich. Enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously though but just average. 510.".

But mostly this film is one big clich. Enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously though but just average. 510.";

However there is absolutely no originality in the story that blends The Shining The Birds Wicked Little Things The Sixth Sense The Others The Amityville Horror Poltergeist The Gate The Ring The Grudge and many other movies plus a collection of clichs and a terrible happy end. The story has a great flaw and does not explain why Jessica and her family are haunted by the Rollins however when Burwell threatens the Solomon family why the ghosts do not protect them? My vote is six.Title Brazil Os Mensageiros The Messengers".

	schema:headline " A lazy horror film that is filled with the usual clichs";
	schema:reviewBody "After having problems in Chicago the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter Jess Kristen Stewart and her 3yearold brother Ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won't allow them to live in peace.The Messengers starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that's a lot more humorous than frightening. After reading the premise I thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential. Unfortunately the film didn't live up to its potential although I should have expected this since the trailer was awful. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was full of silly sequences and bland dialog. The characters were not developed at all and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots so it was hard to feel sympathy for them.The directors did a horrible job at building up suspense. They mainly relied on cheap scares like loud noises and random jumps. The music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next scary moment. I also didn't like how they pretty much just used one location for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of the story and that's where the majority of the filming took place so it got a little boring after awhile to see the same area. Also I didn't like the closeups of the actors. During a conversation the camera would continually jerk from character to another in the span of five seconds and it got really annoying. The directors did create a decent atmosphere and they do get some points for making their movie stylish. However since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects it's not really that hard to make your movie look nice especially if you are working on a Hollywood film.The acting was atrocious and if this movie had been released in December I'm sure it would have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in Panic Room but you wouldn't be able to tell she has talent by watching her performance in The Messengers. She was okay at acting scared and that's it. The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was just awful when it came to everything. It sounded like she was reading her lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions I have ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just very wooden and he showed almost no emotion. John Corbett gave the best performance and he had a couple of good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to out act many of the adult actors. Overall this lame horror film is not worth watching because of it's blandness and lazy filmmaking. Rating 410".

When the bad guy all of the sudden becomes a homicidal maniac solely because a bunch of crows start pecking him then I have a problem spending 9.00 for a ticket! Alfred Hitchcock would be spinning in his grave. Didn't anyone learn anything in their college Film 101 class? A good movie has at its roots an INTERESTING story!Here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie If you have desperate financial problems move from Chicago to the middle of nowhere in North Dakota to grow Sunflowers I kid you not!. If your toddler has serious neurological problems from a car accident move away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to an isolated small town which at best has a community hospital. Hire a drifter to live  work with you out of the blue without checking any references when you have a teenage vixen daughter a wife and toddler.  I'm glad they're not my parents! A town where everyone knows everything would have no problem missing a triple homicide just outside of town. And of course blame the man's lunacy on a bad crop of Sunflowers! Doesn't anything else grow in North Dakota? A couple of days after you buy your rundown house  with huge vines growing everywhere  that it reminds you of Jack and the Beanstalk a guy from the XFiles ala Smoking Man I'm glad to see the cigarettes didn't get him I guess he doesn't inhale! will just suddenly sneak up on you while you're working to offer you the sale price of your home plus 15 more for absolutely no reason!I think you get the picture. I have seen so many godforsaken awful movies in the past month it just blows my mind! Is it that difficult to make a movie that doesn't treat the audience like an idiot? I'm glad at least the crows in this sorry film turned out to have the some brains! I wish I could say the same for whomever thinks they are going to make money off this celluloid piece of trash!".

	schema:reviewBody "Special sneak previews are always a good time. No matter what movie it is you are seeing the theatre will always be packed by people who have been awaiting the film like free stuff thought it'd be something to do or just got lost. Either way no matter how good or bad the film the audience alone will make it enjoyable. Now when said movie is a PG13 pseudo horror film can you really delve into horror when the MPAA is on your back censoring everything? you know there will be chatter laughing and breath holding. With The Messengers the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous outbursts and warnings to the characters on screen. As for the actual movie I feel sorry for those involved because it really could have been much better had it been paced right and allowed to stretch its legs beyond the scarefadetoblackshow aftermath progression these films have. In the end we are shown a boring plodding story with no surprises and few moments of actual suspense.The story is a common one. A family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try and rebuild their relationship with each other. Once settled in the spirits of the house come out to the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for the parents to disbelieve everything told to them. Of course the child is not crying wolf and those around only find out when it is too late. I will credit the Pang Brothers directors of the acclaimed The Eye that I would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without Hollywood interferencesupposedly reshoots on The Messengers were done by someone else but the brothers retained credit it's a shame what our studio system does to foreigners especially when it was creative independence which made the films that brings them in and not bottomline interference for really having a fitting style and for keeping the tired plot line somewhat fresh. Unfortunately though I also must give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness. Similar to why I disliked What Lies Beneath I couldn't stand the drawn out suspense which goes so far as to make it laughable. When our heroine and her brother stand in a hallway with a ghost behind them the scene lasts about eight minutes with just static oddly composed closeups and depth of field focus changes to end up culminating to absolutely nothing. For being only 84 minutes I almost think it would have worked better even shorter.Besides a very effective opening sequence featuring the fantastic Jodelle Ferland strangely playing a boy and a great atmospheric credit sequence the only thing that saves the film from utter garbage is the acting. Except for Penelope Ann Miller who first made me wonder what ever happened to her and then after a few scenes made me understand why I never asked that question in the years she was absent and Dustin Milligan completely lacking in credibility the acting is very strong. Dyan McDermott does a nice job as the father trying to keep his family together through all the tough times. He has many little moments of light comedy to counteract his serious dramatic role. William B. Davis everyone's favorite Cancerman is used effectively as an almost foreboding character sadly not utilized more. Our true stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart plays the emotion very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and Panic Room on her resume. As for Corbett if he didn't pull off his role the entire movie would have unraveled completely. I do wish he would be given more work as I've enjoyed him since the underappreciated series The VisitorI still need to check out his first role in Northern Exposure a show I haven't yet been able to catch up on. It's a shame he will probably be most recognizable for the overrated My Big Fat Greek Wedding.If anything The Messengers gave me a nice introduction to the Pang Brothers' work and reinvigorated my desire to check out their Chinese horror catalog. The mood and performances were there it was just the simple and vacant story that needed way too much padding to make a feature film. If they delved more into other characters rather than just Stewart's it could have been more effective while also having something more to show then ten minute scenes of nothing. If our protagonist is the only one being attacked there is no suspense as to how far the creatures will go to harm her. The moments of danger had no gravity to them and until the ending really just stood in as filler. I am excited however for the free comic book given away after the special screening as hopefully the medium will allow for a faster paced story that engrosses before it tries to surprise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's cut through everything in the first paragraph. The Messengers the newest film by the Pang Brothers Danny and Oxide as a horror movie is profoundly bad. And just as a movie in general is a big disappointment. It's nothing but a rewarmed Sixth Sense and as long as that picture is still available there is no reason on Earth to pay money to see this turkey.Lately horrorslasher films such as the Final Destination series Wrong Turn Boogie Man The Ring 2 and The Grudge are becoming increasingly more reliant on big shocks with no payoff for instance something jumps out at the person on screen elicits a gasp from the audience but turns out to be a cat or a crow or something. Little goes into making it a genuine frightening experience like The Sixth Sense or Signs or some of the classic horror movies of the 1940s '50s and '60s.The Messengers relies upon the same old tired clichs as these newer far inferior films and is therefor old tired and  to my surprise  ended up as one of the most boring movies I have seen in awhile.The plot has another stupid family led by dad Roy Dylan McDermott The Practice mom Denise Penelope Ann Miller Awakenings Kindergarten Cop TV series Desperate Housewives big sis Jess Kristen Stewart Zathura A Space Adventure and toddler Ben Evan Turner who move to North Dakota from Chicago.The reason for the move is never really outlined here but it has something to do with the dad's inability to find work and Jess' drunken driving escapades. We know there will be trouble immediately because they move into a big Gothic house in the middle of nowhere a domicile that looks like the Munster's summer home. Oh and the first five minutes of the movie show something really horrible happened there.Jess hates the place hey who could blame her but optimistic pop hopes to make a go out of raising sunflowers despite the unusually large amount of crows fluttering about. But when he meets Burwell John Corbet Raising Helen and looking like Kevin Costner in the film version of My Name Is Earl an itinerant drifter and expert on raising sunflowers things start to pick up.But then weird things begin to happen Jess is terrorized by a violent unseen force in the house of course no one else but the twoyearold Ben can see it so she's labeled a flake and the crows keep hanging around. Ben also is able to detect the unearthly creatures but since he's two he cannot articulate it. Scene after scene of people telling the little boy to tell them what he sees finally had me wanting to yell to the screen He can't tell you! He's two  freaking'  years old! Yes have the only protagonist who can solve all of these things be a mute toddler is real smart. Anyway we're left to ponder the sanity of Jess when and if Ben will ever properly describe the paranormal visions he sees if dad will make the sunflower thing work if the high plains drifter is a good guy or bad what the point of the George Plimptonlooking Realtor is how a pitchfork plunged in the back can only be a flesh wound what mom's role in the family is and where are all the crows coming from.All of this while waiting and wondering for something  anything  to happen. The conclusion is really lame as well and once again begs the question of how a spirit which has no physical body can cause harm to a living person. Very dull pointless and most terrible of all not frightening in the least.Oh and there are a lot of crows in this movie.".

	schema:headline " Sometimes It's a Good Idea to Shoot the Messenger";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clichd subpar haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending. Clue 1 for all considering seeing this turkey Sam Raimi didn't direct it. Although commercials for the movie play up his involvement in truth he is one of four producers. It's too bad that someone as talented as Raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie. I don't think he would ever have directed something like this that task was left to the Pang Brothers.The screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other horror films so you'll find absolutely zero original content in The Messengers. What we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of Pulse a couple that could have come from The Birds one or two from The Others etc. Nearly every scene almost every line of dialogue is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies. The whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the surprise ending long before it comes.Right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts has nothing to do with this movie. In fact everyone can see the ghosts. The teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them even quite early in the movie. I'm sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal which otherwise is entirely absent. Now you know so don't be fooled! Perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. It simply isn't there. All of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. Coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened anyhow? Didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him? it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots loud noises visual flashes and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling Boo! All we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorlymade film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house. If there's any message that The Messengers delivers it's Don't waste your time on this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well at least we have to acknowledge the big Hollywood horrorproducers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive. Instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of Asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in America they now discovered they could simply hire the Asian directors and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the states. That's like killing two birds with one stone way to go guys! The Messengers is pretty much identical to every other supernatural chiller that came out of the Oriental countries ever since Ringu. Roughly translated this means it's a boring overlong and entirely gorefree film but it does feature copious amounts of false scares and embarrassingly weak did we scare you yet? moments. The Pang Brothers Danny  Oxide previously made the extremely overrated The Eye and it sort of is a tradition for them to build up a story with clues and hints towards a point where it becomes nearly impossible to meet the expectations of their curious audiences yet they don't seem eager to alter their formula any time soon. And they're also unscrupulous enough to recycle the same old  repetitive ghost topics over and over again. Restless spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of a remote countryside farm? The protagonist family torn apart by unprocessed traumas from the past so they first have to restore faith and trust in each other? Give me a break! Throw in a videotape and a sevendayscurse why don't you? Even the attempts to make you jump in your seat are too djvu and won't scare anyone over the age of 7. Slamming doors filthy  gradually larger growing stains on the walls ghostly appearances noises coming from the cellar... The endless overuse of cheap tricks like this is almost becoming insulting to horror fans. The Messengers revolves on a family on their way to a new life in the country as the growers of sunflowers. The family situation is kind of dysfunctional since a personal tragedy which doesn't get revealed until late in the film caused their youngest son to stop talking and the parents to distrust their revolting teenage daughter. Soon after the children experience strange presences in remote farmhouse but they don't manage to convince their parents to leave. That's pretty much concludes the entire film. Little Ben sees things but he can't talk and Jessica repeatedly gets attacked by supernatural forces but nobody listens to her. The basic premise of The Messagers is very derivative of Stanley Kubrick's immortal classic The Shining only it lacks the constantly ominous atmosphere and disturbing tone. The script takes itself far too seriously even though it's fairly easy to predict the final denouement and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. At least The Eye delivered some genuine shocks in the end whereas the happy happy joy joy ending of The Messengers is just pathetic. The only positive elements I can think of are the beautiful rural filming locations the adequate editing job and the promising young acting talents and beauty Kristen Stewart. And there's an uncanny but sadly underdeveloped supportive role for William B. Davis.".

	schema:reviewBody "The clichd scare moments in a horror film is when a earwringing sound is followed up by a musical motif which then coincides with an inanimate object unexpectedly zooms right past the camera lenses as a visual indicator that trouble is only moments away. The purpose of these scare moments is to produce goosebumps manifesting on your skin. Most horror fans take pride of the scare moments like a grain of salt The Messengers has lots of scare moments but it seems that it is the only thing that's going for it. It provides you with scares but there's no clear story and the plot becomes ludicrous. It comes to the point where it becomes more laughable than horrific because the scare moments tend to constantly materialize to the screen. The fans took it to heart because they were forced into it but to me it was just too repetitive. It's absolutely pitiful this movie is a dustcollector because it had a lot of good quality traits that made for an entertaining scare fest. The lack of an effective psychological horror is overwrought by the poorly execution that the narrative has to offer. Is the leading character seeing apparitions or is she just delusional? If the horror effects had a connection with the synopsis it would be one of those obscure PG13 rating horror films that actually works. The Messengers heavily paraphrases itself from a plethora of other horror films like The Amityville Horror The Grudge The Omen Poltergeist and so much more it doesn't have the time or space to be something original. Just a compilation of horror films disguised as an original movie. And even though she doesn't get praised for her acting but Kristen Stewart was the only performer who showed that she even cared about this poorly crafted film. Everyone else knew this movie was stupid so they decided to not care about the material. And if they don't care then should we?Chicago natives Roy Dylan McDermott and Denise Penelope Ann Miller migrate to an isolated small town in North Dakota as way to renewal the troubled issues that their daughter Jess Stewart is facing. We know she's a troubled teen when her daddy dear says his schmaltzy diatribe about doing this for your own good tough love tactic. We take pity for Jess for abandoning her friends and to move into dilapidated house while her father and hired assistant John Corbett are growing sunflower seeds. Suddenly Jess starts seeing the spooks and when she tells her parents about it they easily dismiss her saying she's just making excuses because all old houses are haunted. The family's logic isn't very convincing but it really cranks up in fullblown contrivances when they had to include a subplot involving a pitchfork killer into the mix during the last 30 minutes. Never mind that the ghosts are causing havoc in their lovely estate but now everything has to have an explanation. Can't a spook just perform hisher mischief without spoonfeeding its audience to explain why they're causing evil like we're dumb? It just ruins the fun of horror films. Early during the movie we have to sit through the tiresome family plot that offers little to no interest or intrigue complete with abysmal character development. But the direction by Danny and Oxide Pang does succeed in making the atmosphere very intensifying. When the ghosts makes their presence known it is a defining moment and reminds us we are seeing a horror film. Instead of putting out the scares we have to focus on the contrived plot. The ending lacks in any kind of climax even though the setpieces were right in front of us. The PG13 horror film is suitably fit and for the rightful reason and not a good one at that. It generates to convoluted plot devises and randomly selected twists that makes no significance to this narrow plot. Only hardcore horror enthusiasts might like this film just for the scare moments. Good for a popcorn and soda to go with this stupidity. Don't rush when you eat or you may walk out before the film ends.".

OK well let's see a desolate house in the country? We know that the previous owners were disposed of? New family moving in? Doors won't open? The little kid sees more than the adults? The family is troubled to start with... in the most insanely insipid manner imaginable with blackandwhite blandness of character and empty lines. There is no character building whatsoever just building up the TYPE each character is supposed to stand for OK the wellmeaning loser father the subdued wife the alienated daughter and the 3yearold. Can we get any more clichs please? OK here's some crows. CROWS! In a horror flick! What creative brilliance. Also all the symbolism e.g. the meaning of the crows the meaning of the clock the meaning of the final crisis and resolution is ludicrously obvious.Dylan McDermott seems like he wandered off from a Disney family morality play and wound up in a horror movie Penelope Ann Miller's performance made me feel that it was either going to be revealed she had just become part of the family or is the father's new girlfriend who for some reason chose to move in with him into a haunted house on the prairie  there is absolutely no chemistry between her and her husband which is rationalized later on but in my opinion her performance is just too perfect in that area. Kristen Stewart and John Corbett are OK but this is certainly not a movie where they had any opportunity to shine. Note that Kristen Stewart was only 1617 when the movie was shot so that's pretty fine unannoying work from such a young actress. There are a few moments where the cinematography seems to be seriously wrong especially in the scene where the father discovers some crows have been eating his sunflower seed and the next two minutes. The score becomes catchy in odd moments and is pretty much as formulaic as the plot overall.Everything about this movie is completely formulaic. This is the type of film where in the first three minutes you can tell what the ending will be and then you can just switch your mind off and then you see that ending happen. If you are new to horror movies just see the original Amityville Horror The Others and The Signs. If you're just looking for something to eat pizza and get wasted over this is a safe choice this movie is mediocre it is not extremely bad. If you're looking for a good scare look somewhere else.".

Also suspicious of Poundstone is Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne who lets slip to Miller that Poundstone told her he had secret talks in Jordan with an important Iraqi codenamed Magellan who told him about the weapons though it now seems likely Magellan's true information was to the contrary.

The war being fought in the film is more between the Pentagon and the CIA than the US v Iraq which makes it all the more interesting and the film allows you to see things from Iraq's perspective for a change. The premise set up in the film regarding the 'Intelligence' regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction used to justify the invasion is entirely believable. Matt Damon is well suited to his part as a unit leader Roy Miller as is Brendan Gleeson as the CIA man and Greg Kinnear is refreshingly nasty as Poundstone from the Pentagon  all turn in good performances. Shot on location in Morocco Spain and in England I could have sworn we were in Bagdad the whole time  settings are very convincing. Yes there is too much hand held camera movement that quickly brought on discomfort followed by a headache but that is my only negative and as the film doesn't outstay its welcome I'm willing to concede the shakiness probably lends an 'embedded' realism. Is any of the plot or characters based on real events or people? I have no idea other than learning the film is based on the 2006 nonfiction book 'Imperial Life in the Emerald City' by Rajiv Chandrasekaran a journalist for The Washington Post. I haven't read the book so I can't comment on how closely the film follows it. I spent a few moments of the film wondering about the story's authenticity but as a piece of cinema entertainment in its own right Green Zone gets the green light from me.".

	schema:headline " A thriller that doesn't forget its political foundations";
	schema:reviewBody "The new offering from Paul Greengrass is an intriguing progression from his previous films. Marrying the political engagement of films such as 'Bloody Sunday' with the blockbuster attraction of the Bourne films 'Green Zone' was always going to promise attractive viewing and it doesn't disappoint.Matt Damon's character Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller is in charge of an American Armed Forces unit in search of Weapons of Mass Destruction during the early stages of the Iraq conflict. When their search proves fruitless Miller begins to question the supposedly 'solid' intelligence that gave the locations of these WMD sites. The plot follows Miller's demand for answers from an unstable command desperate to hide them revealing a political division at the heart of the U.S administration.Yes this is fiction but Greengrass has become adept at tapping into our taste for conspiracy contextualising his stories within a political reality that has become all too familiar to us since the invasion began in 2003. It's thrilling stuff and I think that is the key word to remember when watching this film. Thriller. Yes there is political content here and yes it does hold up to some scrutiny. For example the opening of the movie portrays the sense of confusion of conflicting command structures particularly well really getting into the disorientation and intrigue of a military operation that isn't going as planned. The role of journalist Laurie Dayne played by Amy Ryan also provides a wellexecuted analysis of how the media's coverage of the facts can be impaired by the manoeuvrings of political and military authority.There are moments when this political engagement appears heavyhanded but that is because the director's priority is always first and foremost entertainment. For example there is nothing subtle about Damon's character walking into a scene of Americans drinking and lounging by the pool of one of Saddam Hussein's palaces. Furthermore the film suffers from conventional Hollywood stereotypes when it tries to depict the 'downtroddenyethopeful' Iraqi citizen who works with Miller in order to expose the truth about his country. Khalid Abdalla best known for his lead role in 'The Kite Runner' does his best with the material available but the role lacks depth and complexity and for me is one of the few disappointments of the film.But as I said this a work of fiction and there are plenty of moments where our taste for excitement and spectacle is satisfied. Greengrass' now familiar 'handycam' filming style is appropriate to the sense that we are never sure as an audience where the threat is going to come from. It provides a kick of adrenaline to the action sequences making us feel the sand in our mouths as we are thrown to the floor and adds docudrama realism to the events on screen. Some of the reviews I have seen complained about this style of cinematography but I think Greengrass has managed to make the technique contribute to the content of his film rather than becoming overly intrusive or threatening our cinematic experience.There is a delicious feeling of melodrama to the piece as a whole  the moustached Jason Isaacs as the sinister Special Forces operative provides a gripping counterbalance to the inquiring Matt Damon. Brendan Gleeson is superb as the CIA agent that won't roll over and accept the demands of the military and political commanders. Indeed the cast as a whole appears to work well together in a film that successfully marries the need for political engagement with the desire for cinematic spectacle. It is a film designed for box office appeal and yet despite this it doesn't compromise on the political foundations on which it is based. Its climax is a fine reward for the audience's suspense  in short a wellworked film that cuts to the heart of our craving for conspiracy and revelation.James Gill Twitter jg8608".

A chance encounter with a sympathetic Iraqi civilian puts Miller on the trail of an Iraqi general who could provide him with the evidence that he needs. However the Pentagon the recently deposed Baathists and the CIA all have different agendas for Iraq's future and Miller finds himself being used by players from all sides.This is a tautly paced engrossing thriller that inhabits a moral world where all colors are shades of gray. The cast are excellent and the direction is topnotch. Particularly noteworthy is the realistic and sympathetic depiction of the Iraqi characters irrespective of their allegiances. There is no shortage of action and the plot keeps you guessing until the credits roll. Along with The Hurt Locker this is one of the best films about the Iraq war and a brilliant night out to boot.".

Anyway I was prepared to watch the movie based on the trailers but had second thoughts when the nature of the movie was mentioned on a movie review show on TV here in Australia. That nature concerned the movie venturing into the rationale of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.So taking a punt I saw the movie armed with this new information. It's actually good...not depressing like movies with this type of theme can be. Not sure how much reality there is to it...it seems to cover the bases on the reasons given as to why the US invaded Iraq and the underlying reality on the ground.What's particularly interesting is how the Pentagon and the C.I.A. are depicted. No doubt there are numerous American movies where both organisations are depicted as suspect or evil. Here one organisation comes off as acting in good faith and acting morally. Don't know enough about the war to say for certain if any US organisation can claim to have acted ethically but this dichotomy is illuminating for the factoids it throws at the audience.If the movie does have a lot factual truth to it then some of the events in it are truly disturbing...e.g. how the U.S. deals with people who may be able to disprove the official government line on the reasons for the war. Maybe this is just artistic license or perhaps it's real politic as far as the U.S. goes...and anyone who has read Noam Chomsky knows that the U.S. goes all the way.I'm reminded of General Colin Powell's handontheheart moment in the U.N. where he showed satellite photos of vehicles and swore that these were mobile weapons of mass destruction delivery vehicles. Turns out that they were milk trucks...like the Iraqis said they were. It's this 'evidence' which convinced a reluctant U.N. to take the US' assertions as true and to authorise the invasion of Iraq. This movie's trailer is like General Colin Powell's moment of infamy...the trailer bears no relation to what you actually see. But it's more compelling than what the general's photo turned out to be.Matt Damon as Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller makes for a good lanternjaw type hero...if such a figure actually exists you'd think they would have have been run out of the ranks for not towing the official line. Anyway the movie is about Miller's role in finding those elusive weapons of mass destruction that President Bush assured us were there. When he doesn't have much luck finding them he wants to find out why...".

Personally my eyes have been able to follow a moving object ever since I was a child. I have no problem with a handheld camera.As for the movie 'Green Zone' is an excellent action thriller about a US Army Warrant Officer investigating the shady reasons why the military intelligence being fed to the Iraq Survey Group is failing to uncover weapons of mass destruction in postinvasion Baghdad. Much of the ensuing shenanigans are inspired by the findings of both the Iraq Intelligence Commission Report and the UK's Butler Review which in 2004 found that prewar intelligence had been highly suspect.I say 'inspired' because 'Green Zone' is fictionunless I blinked and missed it there's no opening title card claiming based on a true story. Conservatives so often unable to discern fact from fiction will view the film as a piece of docudrama reportage and find it deeply flawed as it would be if it purported to be such a thing. The rest of us will recognize that Greengrass has crafted an excellent conspiracy thriller that simply uses the controversial politics of postwar Iraq as background color and does so very well. As is to be expected from a director who at this point in his career can do this stuff in his sleep the action sequences are brilliantly choreographed the tension masterfully built and the characters multilayered. The cinematography that others have called ugly I found added a sense of realism particularly in the grainy night scenes. My only complaint is a couple of instances in which Iraqi characters begin spouting embarrassing soapbox polemic. It isn't that such thoughts are out of character just the way they are expressed the dialogue being too obvious and cheesy. Thankfully such moments can be counted in seconds rather than minutes. What's so impressive about 'Green Zone' is the seemingly authentic locations. It really does look as though it were filmed in Baghdad. Instead it was shot on location in England and Spain. A production designer hasn't worked such magic since 'Full Metal Jacket' converted a London parking lot into the battlefields of Vietnam.'Green Zone' is an excellent movie that will be thoroughly enjoyed by fans of political conspiracy thrillers. It isn't presented as factual and only fools would look to a movie for facts. For facts read books or better yet read the Iraq Intelligence Commission Report and the Butler Review.

	schema:reviewBody "Feel like seeing an action flick watching bodies fly everywhere and good guys kill bad guys? Do not see this movie.Green Zone was a very surprising experience for me. I was on the way to the cinema expecting as several posters quoted 'Born goes epic'. Instead I got a nice combination of politics moral dilemmas and maybe even some very light philosophy.The film takes a popular but still a controversial  for many people shameful view on the Iraq war. The plot is complex but relatively easy to follow thanks to asometimes too straightforward set up good directing and sensible scene sequences. The plot does not bring you any traditional action flick twists and rarely pushes you to the edge of the seat but makes up for it by making you think about some of the more real and worrying aspects of war and politics. The characters could have used some more development and dynamic but on the bright side it was nice to not have every single thing rotate around Bourne. On the contrary throughout the whole movie the focus was on a wider picture rather than on any of the more specific details in the story itself. It was nice to see the lines between bad  good drawn in such a blurry manner. I was confused and indecisive in labelling characters as on the goody or the baddie side. The plot had an interesting ending slightly ruined by a cheesy line from one of the characters but brilliantly made up for by a fantastic scene of Baghdad at night. I found that whilst the epilogue of the movie was needed to explain consequences something like a few sentences appearing on a black screen would have finished the movie in a much nicer mood than that in which it finished in reality. The plot took up an intellectual viewpoint on the Iraq war and gave me something to think about on the subject of both the Iraq war and the idea of war in general. This was something that you rarely see in movies like this and made the movie the enjoyable experience that it is.The directing  cinematography in the movie were nothing special. Several style ideas were reused from the Bourne movies and action was not always as gripping as one might want or at least expect. However it was never bad either  all sequences kept a consistent standard of dialogue special effects and the little action that there was.The acting in the movie was one of the few things that I expected. Matt Damon delivered his usual performance a cool incontrol soldier committed to get to the bottom of things. The supporting actors all delivered their parts well enough with Greg Kinnear holding his usual cunning conniving corrupt moneythirsty politician role. However because as mentioned before the film focused on a wider picture the acting did not put me off the movie in any way whatsoever. The one other thing which the movie lacked almost entirely throughout was humour. It's always nice to get a giggle in between moral implications and people dying all over the place.I have given the movie 7 out of 10 in total with seven points for wider plot depth intellectual aspects directing  cinematography CGI  special effects and the last three points deduced for acting immediate plot depth action sequences and humour or rather the lack of it. It's a pleasant and original surprise and something that will make you think after leaving the cinema.MK".

	schema:reviewBody "Green Zone is a film that deafly navigates the possibly disastrous path of action saturation creative liberties and touchy subject matter. Matt Damon's and director Paul Greengrass' third effort after The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum tells the fictionalized but accurate account of the span following the opening siege of Iraq where the supposed WMD program of Saddam Hussein failed to unveil itself. Green Zone will keep those looking for a sharp actionwar film entertained and enrapture those interested in the politically charged events of the war without alienating either group.This may not be the hard hitting expose for which some may be yearning but it is all we could hope for in a mainstream Hollywood product. Greengrass is certainly no stranger to the events surrounding Iraq having already helmed the highly touted United 93 which tells the story of one of the doomed planes on September 11th of 2001. His obvious passion for the subject gives Green Zone the gravitas and grounding a film like this needs and with the exception of multiOscar winner The Hurt Locker and Ridley Scott's Middle Eastern thriller Body of Lies this is the strongest of the growing glut of such movies.Damon stars as Roy Miller a chief warrant officer who is at the forefront for the search of WMD sites all of which were gathered from a mysterious source known only as 'Magellan'. When site after site turns up empty Miller begins to ask questions that high ranking officials do not want asked. With seemingly his only friend in all this Marin Brown Brendan Gleeson a veteran CIA operative and an Iraqi interpreter named Freddy Miller goes rogue to uncover the truth. Standing in his way are the remaining loyal insurgents a Whitehouse bureaucrat named Poundstone Greg Kinnear who wants to keep things on track and his asset on the ground who is tasked with stopping Miller's inquiries.Matt Damon is extremely solid here. He has no weepy dramatic scenes or big blowups through which to act showy. He is very believable and low key and is an infinitely charismatic and commanding presence on screen. Kinnear is also quite good as the slimy suit that stands in the way of our hero and the lesser know supporting cast all drive home noteworthy performances as well. Much has been said about Greengrass' handheld camera technique which seems to leave some on the nauseous side. I have however come up with a theory in light of all the critics starting to get on my nerves and actually managing to turn my attention to the so called shaky cam which has never before bothered me.Take for example film critic James Berardinelli who seems to be on the line when it comes to that style of shooting. For the latter two Bourne films he made ample criticism of the shaky cam and it would seem that his overall consensus reflected such. For Green Zone he claimed the vibration was far more restrained which is in contrast to most other critics who claimed it was the worst yet. My theory? One's perception of the film is not due to the camera movement but rather the inverse. Depending on how engrossed a person is with the material performances etc that is how watchable they perceive the film to be. So in the case of Berardinelli the camera movement was likely fairly similar but he found Green Zone's material simply better.Cinematography aside Green Zone is a rousing action film with a spectacular climax. Not only will it keep you entertained on a Friday night but it will serve as a reminder of what happened in Iraq every time you press play.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " The Other Magellenic Word";
	schema:reviewBody "Pretty interesting stuff. If anyone needs convincing that genres and cinematic vocabularies are evolving all they have to do is go to the movies. This one is a part of a new trend the wardetective genre. It is strictly noir in the sense that forces outside our hero's world are at work on him. He is an ordinary Joe he has amazing coincidences happen to him he is trust into the role of detective and serves as our onscreen surrogate as we discover together some hidden perfidy. So innovation number one is that we have a wardetective genre almost fully formed already. The action is there for the same reason that smoke was 5060 years ago to enrich the screen. But this is no longer a war movie based on the assumptions of the founding genre. Then we went to these to help identify as a tribe to reenforce that identity by celebrating its natural values and of course we have to win. Not here. In this case we have what is widely known about these wars. They were a mistake based on fictitious realities coaxed out of tortured detainees. The military here is not used to validate an identity but to validate that we are estranged from the institutions we used to trust and venerate. Look at the characters on the US side everyone is a stock stereotype smarmy Cheney factotum grizzled CIA operative earnest girl reporter wild amoral snakeater scads of lazy soldiers in battlefield luxury.The only two interesting characters are Iraqi. They not only are real men with complex motives but they are the ones with agency.I can see that they had some trouble with how critical to be of the men in uniform. Apparently a whole subplot about abuse of luxuries at Sadam's palace was jettisoned. Only a few scenes remain necessary for the main plot. But that whole business together with the name is left dangling. I think the movie failed to make money because it is easy to buy into an evil operation managed from the White House. But we still find it hard to not think of the man in theater as anything but noble.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

So innovation number one is that we have a wardetective genre almost fully formed already. The action is there for the same reason that smoke was 5060 years ago to enrich the screen. But this is no longer a war movie based on the assumptions of the founding genre. Then we went to these to help identify as a tribe to reenforce that identity by celebrating its natural values and of course we have to win. Not here. In this case we have what is widely known about these wars. They were a mistake based on fictitious realities coaxed out of tortured detainees. The military here is not used to validate an identity but to validate that we are estranged from the institutions we used to trust and venerate. Look at the characters on the US side everyone is a stock stereotype smarmy Cheney factotum grizzled CIA operative earnest girl reporter wild amoral snakeater scads of lazy soldiers in battlefield luxury.The only two interesting characters are Iraqi. They not only are real men with complex motives but they are the ones with agency.I can see that they had some trouble with how critical to be of the men in uniform. Apparently a whole subplot about abuse of luxuries at Sadam's palace was jettisoned. Only a few scenes remain necessary for the main plot. But that whole business together with the name is left dangling. I think the movie failed to make money because it is easy to buy into an evil operation managed from the White House. But we still find it hard to not think of the man in theater as anything but noble.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.";

	schema:headline " 'Bourne' goes political";
	schema:reviewBody "In 'Green Zone' the 'Bourne' action blockbuster team led by Paul Greengrass and his star Matt Damon goes to Iraq or rather to a facsimile staged in Spain and Morocco switching from a superassassin's identity crisis to contemporary political and military history.It seemed like this might be the great Iraq movie Americans haven't had a blockbuster as exciting and realfeeling as Bigelow's Oscarwinning 'Hurt Locker' but with real political context. 'Locker' is a superb battlefield action movie but it doesn't delve into the larger issues  and lacking a big name star hasn't been seen by very many people at least for a movie that won the Oscar for Best Picture. More analytical and contextual Iraq war movies like 'Lions for Lambs' 'In the Valley of Eli' 'The Messenger' or 'Rendition' on the other hand have been too small anemic and downbeat to be big box office. If anybody could turn this around and make an Iraq film that's both exciting and a think piece the 'Bourne' guys could right? Unfortunately no though the 'Bourne' team's involvement means 'Green Zone' will substantially outperform 'Hurt Locker' at the box office and they have made an action movie that's boldly political however deeply flawed. Let's bear in mind that the 'Bourne' movies are smart but they're fantasy. Dealing with historical events is is a different kind of project.The focus of 'Green Zone' is on the early stages of the 2003 US Iraq invasion. The writer Brian Helgelund 'L.A. Confidential' 'Mystic River' is trying to get across the information in Rajiv Chandrasekaran's nonfiction 'Imperial Life in the Emerald City' while telling an action tale that follows an investigating tough guy played by Damon. As described in the documentary 'No End in Sight' the US authorities made a number of crucial mistakes in the runup to the war and how the occupation was run. Helgelund gets all this across but the result is a mashup that lacks credibility or logic.First US mistake the key pretext for the invasion Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction or WMD's proved illusory no such weapons were found in locations where an Iraqi credible source said they were hidden. Matt Damon plays Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller who heads a squad charged with checking out places where US intel says there are WMD's stored. He points out the intel is bad and soon finds out his opinion is not wanted by the higher ups represented by Poundstone Greg Kinnear a Bush official who arrives with Ahmed Zubaidi Raad Rawi  a standin for the actual Ahmad Chalabi the US puppet the Bush administration foolishly thought could be put in to head a new government another mistake. 'Green Zone' shows in a scene how spectacularly this fails.Second the allied forces did not prevent widespread looting or maintain the infrastructure. Chaos reigned in Baghdad and eventually the rest of Iraq and the invaders lost the hearts and minds of Iraqis who were enraged at being deprived of safety food water and a steady power supply. This is when Donald Rumsfeld uttered his line Stuff happens. There's no Rumsfeld standin here but the line democracy is messy occurs.Third the provisional authority chose to dismantle the entire Iraqi administrative structure including all Baath Party members in government and the Iraqi army. With the second and third mistakes the US lost its credibility and made a vast number of unnecessary enemies and the way was paved for chaos and civil war in the country.After Chief Miller comes up with doughnuts at every supposed WMD location and becomes convinced the intel is no good in spite of being told at briefings it's pure gold he becomes a cowboy and sets out on a zigzagged path of his own. He's supported by a highranking CIA officer with profound incountry experience named Martin Brown Brendan Gleeson who knows the WMD locations are fake and sees a coverup. Amazing how Miller encounters both Poundstone and Brown right away in the occupation's safe Green Zone palace HQ. In fact Miller has magical access. He also runs into a Wall Street Journal correspondent called Lawrie Dayne Amy Ryan who turns out to have touted the government's dubious WMD stories received from Ahmad Chalabi in widely read articles and she's discovering that she was duped but trying to cover it up. Dayne is a standin for the Times's Judith Miller.By this point it's obvious the screenplay is as schematic and implausible as 'The Hurt Locker's' is specific and real. Hence it's not surprising Chief Miler runs into Freddy Khalid Abdalla  an Iraqi trying to guide any Americans he can find to a meeting of Baath leaders and cohorts held by a big Iraqi general Al Rawi Yigal Naor an Israeli who specializes in playing Arab officials in American movies. Miller now turns into a rogue soldier with Poundstone ordering him reassigned to his unit and Poundstone's more cooperative military operatives out to get him. Miller forgets about looking for WMD's and is now trying to save lives by tracking down Al Rawi which involves sneaking into a prison with Freddy and a million dollars from his CIA ally Brown.This is where things get really exciting with everybody chasing everybody else and Greengrass and his dp Barry Akroyd who incidentally did the photography for 'Hurt Locker' as well as Greengrass' 'United 93' fully up to speed in the action sequences. 'Green Zone' is consistently good on that level but that success is undermined by the overall implausibility. Helgelund is obviously interweaving themes from a book about US mismanagement and aloofness from reality in Baghdad with chases and shootouts staged to give his action hero work to do. Will this movie change anybody's perception of the Iraq war? Probably people who go just for the action will look on the political stuff as decoration as it usually is. But you never know. . .".

	schema:headline " Green Zone Brings to MInd Costa Gavras Film Z";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching Green Zone is an enthralling cinematic experience. Even while going along for the engrossing sensoryoverload ridden and immensely satisfying trip it brings to mind the 1969 Costa Gavras film Z. That film depicted the journey of discovery by a magistrate that led to the conclusion that the system of government he represented and sought to serve faithfully had been corrupted by forces of US sponsored ignorance greed and cynicism. I was posted in Greece for fifteen years. Papandreou wins that election if I don't have the junta take him prisoner. I've advised and armed the Hellenic army. I've neutralised champions of communism. Philip Seymour Hoffman's CIA agent character in Charlie Wilson's War Both Green Zone and Z share that intellectually absorbing rigour. Both are powered by that same action driven unyielding narrative momentum. The same conflict car crash colour and movement packed visceral involvement. The same unnerving progressive revelation of corruption by unseen forces in high places and its effects on the actions of those who are condemned to take the consequences of that stupidity and evil in rather lower places. Green Zone brings to mind the observations about good wars such as WWII and bad wars such as Vietnam by Howard Zinn author of A Peoples History of America and former neighbour mentor and inspiration for Mat Damon. I enjoy the weekly privilege of listening to David Barsarmiane's excellent Coloradobased Alternative Radio news and current history radio shows. My weekly public radio station fix has allowed me to acquaint myself with the analysis of such academic historians as Zinn Naom Chomsky as well as former Marine and Iraq weapons inspector Scott Ritter. But for these who do not enjoy that privilege it is all presented up on the big screen in Green Zone. The slew of popular films that have been prompted by the Middle East military interventions culminating in Avatar demonstrate the rich undercurrent of good old Yankee selfexamination that has survived albeit barely perceived by the public and its news media since the Vietnam War disaster. Copolla's hero in Apocalypse Now summed it up with his Never get out of the boat observation about the futility of opposing the puppet clowns in the Pentagon and the largely unseen forces that pull their strings. The general critical dismissal of Charlie Wilson's War as a light weight comedy rather than a clinical dissection of how the forces of evil can so distort the conduct of foreign policy bears witness to the difficulties faced by the prophets whose words would otherwise have to remain written on the subway walls. But the fact that popular rather than art house big box office cinema is prepared to take on such a critical and analytical role as opposed to that of mere purveyors of government propaganda that the Hollywood studios adopted during the Second World War gives nonAmericans hope that the USA might one day find true redemption.Or does it? As the end credits rolled in the cinema in which I watched Green Zone a lady sitting behind me complained to the bloke who had brought her about the unsatisfying experience to which she had been subjected. He countered that it was an OK war film. She insisted that it could all have been said in five minutes. Mat Damon Soldier Miller where ever you are. Will all your patriotism and self sacrifice meet with such mulish incomprehension? Are we condemned to live in a world in which the Mission Accomplished self delusion is considered to be more worthy than efforts of those who create such engrossing cinema as Green Zone?".

	schema:reviewBody "A tremendous Iraq thriller with a brave and contemporary storyline. It is a story and not a history. Yet it does skilfully blend a number of important political and historical themes into a fiction. Director Paul Greengrass delivers the tale superbly Matt Damon shines as the soldier who learns too much. Brendan In Bruges Gleeson is marvellous in a supporting role as a CIA officer. When Baghdad is secured the hunt for WMD's start and as that search proves consistently fruitless questions start to be asked and it is Damon who is the literal and figurative means for asking them.The plot revels in upsetting conventional stereotypes. The Americans are the good guys AND the bad guys. The Iraqis are simply trying to survive. And the press are neither good nor bad just innocent dupes. Baghdad is convincingly portrayed as an anarchic hellhole the soldiers as decent men simply trying to do the job. However the Politicians fare less well.It remains a mystery as to why America a country which has been the economic and technological powerhouse of the world for a century is so hopeless at Diplomacy and Foreign Affairs. The backdrop of an Administration which went to war with little appreciation of the country it was dealing with and no appreciation of what to do once the war was over is witheringly parodied . A puppet Iraqi leader who less than ten Iraqis had ever heard of is installed and the American administrative presence is headed by a cynical functionary with no sympathy for the country at all and a handful of Washington interns. The brutality of the American Military replacing the brutality of Saddam makes for unsettling viewing.Unsurprisingly with Greengrass at the helm the action sequences are dynamic realistic and authentic. The hand held camera work is used effectively unlike in the Hurt Locker where it is used because nothing else interesting is going on. Damon as Chief Warrant Officer Miller has to perform a role in mechanical plot terms which requires suspension of disbelief to great length and for War Film purists this will rankle. It is true that his freedom of action movement and access bears no relation to the day to day reality of that role in real life. But hey it's a story and a good one.I doubt that this film will play well to an American audience which is neither particularly bothered about Iraq or is bothered about finding out much about it anyway. It's natural constituency is the more sophisticated British and European markets. But it is to the enormous credit of both Universal that they made this and Matt Damon that he fronted it. It took a long while before America was prepared for verite stories about Vietnam and subsequently it is those that are remembered. No doubt that same cycle will have to be lived for Iraq too.".

The film looks at the subject of the search for WMD's in Iraq and we see our protagonist Miller conducting the search from his perspective. The film could have ended being nothing more than a barrage of chases but that wasn't how it really played out. We see the problems encountered and the people met along the way that was interesting to see. No scenes really felt pointless now meaning I wasn't really questioning any of the scenes for their validity more or less being kept at a premium in order to focus the plot. This was a positive move on the part of the makers. It is not without its flaws and there are some such as the final where the action is good but I hate to say this it was the shaky cam that took some of the bite out of it. I don't think I have ever been one of those people to seriously complain about it but it did detract from what was an exciting scene. The sequence itself all seems like a blur and I think I'd need a second viewing to really get a grasp of what was going on it just could have been handled better. However this is really a minor complaint in what was a very enjoyable thriller that didn't drag on when it so easily could have done. Don't mistake it for just another Bourne film as I nearly made that mistake it is thriller that shows Paul Greengrass' excellent credentials and made me want to see more films like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was almost giggling at the opening minutes of this film because I instantly knew that Paul Greengrass was doing it again  that was to send me through another hellacious thrill ride of a movie. That pace slows down a bit as things become very murky. The weight of what is at stake will erase that smile from your face. The other thing about Greengrass is that you have to have your brain operating at a high level to really appreciate the gifts of this master. This is the smartest movie he has ever made  that probably accounts for the lackluster opening weekend box office. It deals with big issues in a big way.As another IMDBer noted the trailer makes it look like a Bourne ripoff. The only thing it shares with Bourne is the adrenaline rush those movies gave you including Liman's excellent 1st Bourne. If Greengrass has a weakness it might be that he cannot resist making your pulse race.This is a very political  complex thriller. FOX news fans stay away your time is better spent watching Beck's home webcam. It wears it heart on its sleeve  makes no apologies for the stance it takes.Matt Damon leads a very impressive cast of actors. He IS NOT Bourne here. It is a delight to see Brendan Gleeson  Amy Ryan here too  Greg Kinnear wears his reptile skin very well. Everybody seems to be underplaying things a bit to great effect. There are other actors from Greengrass's earlier films you may recognize including a cameo by a key player from what I think is Greengrass's best film United 93.The Greengrass team is at the top their game AGAIN but I am so sick of people whining about the camera work in his films. It is edgeofyourseat 1st person POV cinema but then again I like to ski downhill really really fast too.Ineviteably you can't help but to compare this movie to The Hurt Locker which I also loved. This film is much bigger in scale much more political THL was almost totally devoid of politics much less straight forward although it doesn't have the open ending of the Oscar winner  lacks the 1 signature iconic performance of the prior movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "So many reviews dismiss this film as whimsical propaganda. I long for the day when our American friends across the pond start to understand the real sense of irony here irony is not like steely but with a bit of iron in it by the way.What do these people think that the American and British Government have been feeding us over the last 20 years  you've guessed it propaganda. And lots of it. In Britain we have spin doctors for this very purpose  in America you have a President.This film is fiction but the basis of the movie is true. There were no weapons of mass destruction and therefore the war was unjust. Now I don't know why the powers that be sought to invade Iraq. Maybe it was to rid the world of a known megalomaniac. Or just payback time for 911. Or maybe even by dismantling the country and then wading in with billion dollar contracts to rebuild it. Or a crude attempt to corner the oil market pardon the pun. The truth is we will never know.The film itself is flawed in many areas but the overall message is powerful. Matt Damon doesn't disappoint although on many occasions the motives of his character appear ludicrous. And of course Paul Greengrass's renowned shaky camera style does at times make the film difficult to watch. The film also predictably plays a familiar card  that different elements of the US Government CIA vs Army are singing from completely different hymn sheets. This card has been played many times before.But the plot doesn't let up the action scenes are well done and there is a certain aspect of relief that Hollywood even in a limited way is prepared to question the morals of a Government who are clearly not being truthful with their own electorate. And for this reason alone the filmmakers should be applauded.The storyline come conspiracy theory may be propaganda but the moral message is indisputably true. And that much greater propaganda formed a coalition which waged war on a country under completely false pretences. This gives this film merit even if it is not a classic by any standard.I look forward to the raft of Afghan war films to be made over the next 20 years with an underlying message that it is war that can never be won. Watch this space  its going to happen.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the past few years there have been a handful of directors which have brought something to the genre of politicalactionthriller movies that I had thought lost for good namely class quality and substance actually ingredients I and I guess others would like to see in films of any category. From David Mammet with Spartan Peter Berg with The Kingdom and David Gaghan with Syrianna these directors and these movies though perhaps unfairly flying under most people's radars have revived that genre or subgenre of movies. Paul Greengrass is another one of these directors and Green Zone is another one of these movies. In their heyday movies in this category became classics in their own right or at least made for a helluva viewing experience. Three Days Of The Condor Marathon Man The Conversation are just some examples. After providing a very effective antidote to James Bond and Jack Ryan with the sober and somber Jason Bourne Paul Greengrass has returned with a more realistic and vivid thriller Green Zone. This movie is a solid well done and well paced piece of work. The cast the direction camera work score the visuals are on point I didn't feel let down at all. Everything about the movie is somehow muted and restrained which I like. There are no grandiose battle scenes or large scope nonstop action with no sense or context. Paul Greengrass knows how to combine and synchronize all these basic elements whose end result is really a good movie. Perhaps for some people the film is too modest or to limited but it worked for me in so far as what I expected from it. The movie maintained the right balance of intensity and tension and kept me entertained from beginning to end. No disappointment for me here. As for the subject matter and overall theme of the movie well let's just say that it is frightening to see how ignorance incompetence corruption selfinterest and just plain stupidity can make an already dire situation worse! Though the topic might not be new it has sparked my interest to take another closer and much more detailed look at what brought upon the whole sordid episode that is the war in Iraq the ensuing events and the environment which they created.Though only loosely based on the book by journalist Rajiv Chandrasekaran Imperial Life In The Emerald City Inside Iraq's Green Zonea book which I am in the process of reading the movie does touch on and brings forth the absurdity and folly of some of the parties involved in the decisionmaking process which led to the invasion of Iraq and its subsequent unravelling into chaos.The movie though for obvious reasons taking creative licence with the events and the topic is at most a hint a suggestion at some of the underlying causes for the ensuing mess that became Iraq. It is a strong and effective one at that but it is just a hint. It is up to the people to better inform themselves about this whole affair.No matter what opinions one might have of war or political views one owes history and all those that were and continue to be affected by this war to pay closer attention to be more openminded and critical of those who make the policies and take the decisions that so many have to live with. Iraq is no exception...PS July 14 2010 I have recently finished reading Rajiv Chandrasekaran's book Imperial Life In The Emerald City Inside Iraq's Green Zone. I highly recommend this book. Though a work of nonfiction is sure reads like a fictional novel. As I said it is astounding to see how the Bush administration made a situation that was already bad as in the war should never have happened way worse. At times I did not know whether to laugh cry be angry etc. at the same time. What also angers me is that NOBODY has ever been held accountable though the reason why is quite clear if one thinks about it for the sheer incompetence which not only borders on the criminal but IS criminal the failed policies the egregious mistakes the crass nepotism and gross favouritism etc. All in all the book is a great read and a good companion to the movie...to my mind it makes no difference if you first see the movie and read the book later or vice versa. This is one to read digest and think about.".

	schema:reviewBody "Green Zone is an outstanding film.Matt Damon's character Warrant Officer Chief Roy Miller gets frustrated after going on countless missions hunting for Weapons of Mass destruction WMD only to find nothing. He is concerned that he is risking the lives of his soldiers and wants to know what is going on.Greg Kinnear plays a Pentagon Senior official intent on feeding poor intelligence to Damon's team  where have we heard this one before?.The intelligence supposedly comes from Magellan NB references to Magellan are very similar to the true story of Curveball a senior officer in Sadaam's army. As the movie goes on we learn that Kinnear's character has lied about what Magellan said during a meeting. Kinnear said that Magellan told him Sadaam had a WMD program but in actuality there was no program. Kinnear's lie gave the US justification for the war.Green Zone is heavily based on what really happened in Iraq. The War was initiated under the premise that we had to stop Iraq's WMD's. Whether it was a reprisal for 911 is another matter. However it would appear that WMD's were never found.The film has some excellent fighting and action sequences and seems to be accurate as to the portrayal of what life in Iraq is currently like.This film is to be highly recommended to anyone who appreciates a good solid war movie.".

He is concerned that he is risking the lives of his soldiers and wants to know what is going on.Greg Kinnear plays a Pentagon Senior official intent on feeding poor intelligence to Damon's team  where have we heard this one before?.The intelligence supposedly comes from Magellan NB references to Magellan are very similar to the true story of Curveball a senior officer in Sadaam's army. As the movie goes on we learn that Kinnear's character has lied about what Magellan said during a meeting. Kinnear said that Magellan told him Sadaam had a WMD program but in actuality there was no program. Kinnear's lie gave the US justification for the war.Green Zone is heavily based on what really happened in Iraq. The War was initiated under the premise that we had to stop Iraq's WMD's.

	schema:headline " Iraq had WMDs that is why they were attacked in 2003. Or did they?";
	schema:reviewBody "When the US troops attacked Iraq to oust Saddam Hussein in 2003 the overriding justification was intelligence that was certain that Iraq had WMDs weapons of mass destruction and on the heels of the 911 attacks this could not be tolerated. Still today in 2010 no WMDs have been found and the world strongly suspects there never were any. Was it simply incorrect intelligence or was it a conspiracy within the US government to put out false intelligence simply as a justification for an attack? This movie examines that latter scenario.Most of the movie is set in Baghdad and the surrounding areas in the weeks following the attack in 2003 although it was filmed in Spain and Morocco. As the movie opens we see an Army group led by Matt Damon as Chief Miller converging upon a site in the city one that intelligence code named 'Magellan' had given as a site hiding WMDs. They found nothing as was the case in several sites they were led to earlier. Miller being a soldier who wants to know he is there for a legitimate mission begins to question how good the intelligence is. He is basically told to just do his job and shut up. But Miller is not that kind of person and his own questioning leads him to Yigal Naor as General Al Rawi a high official in the deposed regime. Miller begins to suspect that Al Rawi is 'Magellan.' Amy Ryan is reported Lawrie Dayne working for the Wall Street Journal. She is looking for more stories. Greg Kinnear is Clark Poundstone an official with the US administration. Brendan Gleeson is Martin Brown of the CIA and he and Poundstone appear to be on opposite 'teams.' Brown seeks the truth along with Miller.This is a good movie brought to us by the same team that produced the Bourne series of action movies.SPOILERS Miller's hunch was correct they were being fed false information as a way to pacify the public while knowing there were no WMDs. In fact in a meeting in Jordan just days before the invasion in 2003 Al Rawi told the US there were no WMDs left but that was not what they wanted to hear so they created the 'reliable source' as a ruse. In the end Miller wrote his report and sent it via email to Dayne plus each of the major newspapers and TV news programs an expose' of the ruse.".

	schema:headline " A Beautiful and haunting film";
	schema:reviewBody "Berlin Symphony of a Great City' is a film I've watched over and over with fascination.  I think it's true that it is not so much about the people of Berlin although we see many of them but the city itself as a huge living breathing organism.  Back in the 1930s filmmaker John Grierson apparently wrote that this film created nothing' and that it violated the first principles of documentary by showing us nothing of importance but beautiful images.  Looking at it more than 70 years after its creation however its documentary value seems evident to me at least.  I find it fascinating just to see what the people clothing uniforms vehicles streets parks restaurants shops theaters nightclubs and factories looked like in that distant time and place.  It's amazing to contemplate how soon this complex sophisticated society would be consumed in the most primitive debauchery. Do these people really look that much different from those we see on our streets every day?  It makes me wonder what we're all potentially capable of.Some slight differences do seem apparent however.  When a fight breaks out in a public place today people usually try to ignore it or even duck their heads and run for cover.  But in a scene where two men argue violently in the street the Berliners of the 1920s crowd in close around the combatants and even try to separate them and arbitrate the dispute before a policeman moves in.  Whether this was typically European at that time or just typical of its era I really can't say but it seems strange to me today.Although I think the majority of this film was shot in a candid manner and looks it it's obvious that not quite all of it was unstaged as a previous commentator has pointed out.  For example look at the argument scene just mentioned.  Considering one of the camera angles probably from a 2nd floor window the argument must have been staged at the exact spot where this camera could catch it and the crowd's reaction from above.  In addition a second camera was in place at street level to move in close which hardly suggests a serendipitous event.A good musical score is vitally important to bring this film to life.  It's too bad the original score has been lost.  It would be fascinating to know what it was like.  But I think the one written by Timothy Brock for the Kino edition is superb in that it captures its changing moods and rhythms.  If as one internet reviewer commented it seems a bit melancholy that may be apropos considering that this beautiful city and a great many of its inhabitants would be consumed in fire less than 20 years later.".

	schema:reviewBody "Classic and splendid film that is still fascinating to watch. Walter Ruttmann did not make a documentary about Berlin although 75 after date it certainly can be considered a document about a Berlin that is no more he composed a film that tries to catch the essence of the atmosphere of a big city.  The film is a good example of the art style Neue Sachlichkeit functionalism it is a crosssection of Berlin's life in which every element is equally important shown without comment and in its totality it is the expression of the joy of Berlin's life. It is not a film about the life of Berliners it is Berlin seen as a living mechanism.The subtitle referring to Grostadt big city is the key it could have been any other city. The idea as such is not the makers' prerogative. Elsewhere the fascination with the hustle and bustle of the big city was also present as was the idea to catch this on this film and in music e.g. Cavalcanti in France made a film about Paris and the US Ferde Grof composed his musical suite Metropolis 1927 with New York in his mind.  The irony of all these endeavours is that the film or music is abstract but that the result is a romanticizing view.Ruttmann made several abstract film and he refers to them in the beginning with abstract horizontal lines dissolving to rail way tracks. In my view the rest of the film is also abstract. Although we see real people and situations the brilliant editing constantly keeps the film abstract the situation and the people in a shot are not important important is the juxtaposition to other shots is the composition varied enough?. Thus we see a filmic composition in stead of a musical one and the subtitle Symphony is just. As with every composition the theme has to be modulated to keep it interesting and it is here where the weakness of the film is. The building up from the start and elaboration up to the beginning of the afternoon is splendid precise and exiting but from that point it bogs down for a while we see another shop another street etc. without adding much to what already was. It may be that Ruttmann was aware of this note how quickly he finishes the afternoon to continue with the nightlife and then immediately all the excitement and filmic fun is back.In an 1939 interview cameraman Karl Freund said that everything possible was filmed  using only candid cameras. I have my doubts. Let's take for example the sequence of the drowning lady how could he make an extreme closeup with a hidden camera in such a brilliant angle? By the way if she really tried to commit suicide was Freund himself not only one of the gaping bystanders without doing anything to save her?  How could he foresee the right angle to film the prostitute picking up her client near the cornered shop window? Not that it matters for the quality of the film but it proofs the old adagium filming is deceiving.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very straightforward and pleasant silent picture that delivers exactly what it promises. Namely footage of Berlin its residents and the whole spectrum of city activities during an ordinary day in 1927. If you have any interest in seeing real life in Weimar Germany this film is an excellent rental. It opens with an Eisensteinianstyle montage sequence as a train approaches the city. Upon its arrival in Berlin's Union Station the city is remarkably desolate. As the film progresses the city begins to wake up and you are shown residents at work mostly in factories and leisure. You will see shopkeepers businessmen restauranteurs policemen soldiers politicians children at play and even some vagrants. The acts become gradually more harsh as the film progresses with mildly unpleasant imagery beginning to creep in e.g. shots of dogs fighting footage of beggars litter an arrest etc. only to gracefully recede as the film reaches its closing. The final act shows Berlin's night life which is as lavish and swinging as anything in our own Roaring 20's. This is an impeccable time capsule and it has something to offer both film and history buffs. Berlin was truly a world city at this time and it was extremely interesting to see everything in the Weimar's Golden period before Hitler and the destruction that followed. Technically speaking it is a very well made and restored film the footage is crisp and the music was never overwhelming. This is a really easy film to appreciate and it is definitely worthwhile particularly for history buffs. Highly recommended.  Reviews by Flak Magnet".

But watching it now you become reflective of the changes to this important city. It's history since the making of this film events that the director would never see due to his death in 1941 which is devastated by war and divided by a wall. It's always fascinating to see visual objects of the past. Whilst this doesn't have the interesting longevity of the more political Soviet films this is an important piece of silentera documentary and would go on to influence the British documentary movements of the 1930's and 40's.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Berlin a city that has come to life";
	schema:reviewBody "A day in the life of 1920's Berlin Walter Ruttmann's images on screen is structured in a way showing us the great city. Ruttman toured us in the Berlin's awakening midday rest busy afternoon life and evening leisure. A normal day in the heart of the city Berlin but a day full of life and energy. On the whole this sequence focuses primarily on people. Though it's true that it is not so much about the people of Berlin although we see many of them but it is not a film about the life of Berlin people it is Berlin seen as a living organism.Scenes are edited and cut together based on relationships of image motion point of view and content the five reel film is divided into five acts. The first act starts the day beginning with calm waters and a representation of a sunrise. The opening sequence with the train but it's when the train reaches the station that the main part of the movie really begins presenting an interesting typical day in Berlin.Second act shows more how the usual morning starts with the opening of gates shutters windows doors people busy cleaning fruit carts children going to school. A montage of monkeys biting one another telephone operators machinery and dogs fighting is mixed into the general busy work of the office.The third act showed the busy side of the street's of the great city wherein a variety of people of different classes going about their business. There are industrial workers construction workers salespeople shoppers etc. A fight between two men breaks out briefly but is quickly stopped by bystanders and a policeman. There are many crowds a father and bride arriving at a wedding and a strong contrast of some flirtation on the street. Fourth is the lunch break where 1200 is shown on a clock. Berliners start to eat and drink and animals feed. There is a scene in the film wherein social issue was shown in symbolism form wherein during the lunch hour sequences when we see the rich eating in fancy restaurants and the poor eating in harder conditions. Ruttmann then follows it up with the shots of a lion eating his big meal of raw flesh and a few kittens looking for food in the garbage. This is the only real significant hint but rather than seem like the portrayal of a serious social issue of Marxist ideology that one of Marx's arguments is the difference of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. And as the camera moves among the wealthy and the less fortunate while children play and factories roar. Words from a newspaper fly off the screen Murder! Marriage! Money! Money! Money! A wild eyed woman throws herself from a bridge and disappears into the dark water while office workers pound the keys of their typewriters then on the lover's boat on a peaceful city lake. It shows how Ruttman has the power to shift the scenes gracefully and violently manner through each frame shown.Finally the fifth act is the people's entertainment at night. Montage of entertainments includes hockey indoor races boxing and dance contests. The city starts to spin wildly transitions into a majestic fireworks display and thus concludes the day of the great city Berlin.This fascinating classic never loses its ability to capture the attention and imagination of its audience.

	onyx:emotionText "A day in the life of 1920's Berlin Walter Ruttmann's images on screen is structured in a way showing us the great city. Ruttman toured us in the Berlin's awakening midday rest busy afternoon life and evening leisure. A normal day in the heart of the city Berlin but a day full of life and energy. On the whole this sequence focuses primarily on people. Though it's true that it is not so much about the people of Berlin although we see many of them but it is not a film about the life of Berlin people it is Berlin seen as a living organism.Scenes are edited and cut together based on relationships of image motion point of view and content the five reel film is divided into five acts. The first act starts the day beginning with calm waters and a representation of a sunrise. The opening sequence with the train but it's when the train reaches the station that the main part of the movie really begins presenting an interesting typical day in Berlin.Second act shows more how the usual morning starts with the opening of gates shutters windows doors people busy cleaning fruit carts children going to school. A montage of monkeys biting one another telephone operators machinery and dogs fighting is mixed into the general busy work of the office.The third act showed the busy side of the street's of the great city wherein a variety of people of different classes going about their business. There are industrial workers construction workers salespeople shoppers etc. A fight between two men breaks out briefly but is quickly stopped by bystanders and a policeman. There are many crowds a father and bride arriving at a wedding and a strong contrast of some flirtation on the street. Fourth is the lunch break where 1200 is shown on a clock. Berliners start to eat and drink and animals feed. There is a scene in the film wherein social issue was shown in symbolism form wherein during the lunch hour sequences when we see the rich eating in fancy restaurants and the poor eating in harder conditions. Ruttmann then follows it up with the shots of a lion eating his big meal of raw flesh and a few kittens looking for food in the garbage. This is the only real significant hint but rather than seem like the portrayal of a serious social issue of Marxist ideology that one of Marx's arguments is the difference of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. And as the camera moves among the wealthy and the less fortunate while children play and factories roar. Words from a newspaper fly off the screen Murder! Marriage! Money! Money! Money! A wild eyed woman throws herself from a bridge and disappears into the dark water while office workers pound the keys of their typewriters then on the lover's boat on a peaceful city lake. It shows how Ruttman has the power to shift the scenes gracefully and violently manner through each frame shown.Finally the fifth act is the people's entertainment at night. Montage of entertainments includes hockey indoor races boxing and dance contests. The city starts to spin wildly transitions into a majestic fireworks display and thus concludes the day of the great city Berlin.This fascinating classic never loses its ability to capture the attention and imagination of its audience. The technique is creative and resourceful and the images are significant. Everything fits together to make the idea work wonderfully well truly a great classic and contribution to the world of cinema. Although the film seem portray the lives of the people in the city humanity is not its focal topic rather the Berlin City itself how it has come to life in film and how it will be remembered and visited in the time capsule Ruttmann has created for the whole world to see and appreciate.";

A large portion of this film was destroyed in a fire so it took director Hemmings nearly three years to piece together a motion picture out of what remained.  With that in mind this is a remarkable film and one can't help but wonder what the finished product might have been like had it not been for the fire.  For what is most intriguing about this film is the use of real footage of the Weimar Republic Germany in all its glorious decadence and decay.  Whether this footage was used to buffer the missing footage or planned from the beginning I guess we'll never know but it brings an invaluable air of absurdity and black humour to what is already a pretty outrageous film.  All the performances are great especially Bowie who really is one of the most underrated film talents out there.  And the music score which features some of the glorious songs from that era as well as the irresistible theme song from Miss Dietrich is fantastic!  If anyone knows where I can get a copy of the soundtrack let me know!".

Lushly produced and with an astonishing cast fortunately for us allowing some genuine movie greats to perform and sing JUST A GIGOLO is almost a parallel universe to the lives of Sally Bowles and Michael from Cabaret with an equally convincing and sleazy world. Bowie at times even looks like Michael York. Viewers need to be patient and let the story unfold in its awkwardly edited way. Often it seems dubbed and post produced with echoing sound effects. The musical numbers alone are worth the rental on this Gigolo. I hope it is released in your country soon. Otherwise Umbrella Entertainment from Melbourne Australia might help you. They got it from somewhere. There is a KINOWELT logo on the box too. Regarding the soundtrack it was produced at the time and I have it on vinyl so a vintage ! LP store will help you.

The hippie movement brought us the natural look in hottie women with long straight flowing hair and little makeup but Frank's Rat Pack women were still into a gaudy Vegas look. And I'm no expert on 1967 fashions but I sure don't think men ran around in a warm climate I was raised in So Cal wearing hats with their suits.....but enjoy this look back at 1967 when fashions and what was cool were changing dramatically today's starts don't even change their names chuckle.The film is beautifully filmed on actual Miami locations by a renowned cinematographer Joseph Biroc check him out here on IMDb. And of course Richard Conte's house is no mansion with its chain link fence along the waterwayhe's an honest cop not a multi zillionaire....but the house looks real cuz it is real!I submit that Richard Breen's script if full of truly great hard boiled lines.....even the one where Jill dumps Frank telling him you'd probably just lose me in a poker game anyway and Frank agrees. Check out Sue Lyon who looks great to meif Jill fails to excite you she does nothing for me I think you'll like Sue as she is even convincing in the part beside being hot looking.So stop being grouchy and enjoy!".

Nancy Sinatra sings the theme song penned for her by guess who Lee Hazelwood.    Jill St. John has a nice comedy part as the femme fatale who hates Miami twenty miles of sand looking for a city.  It was not a good idea to dress Mrs. Schuyler in a polkadot outfit which sets up a fierce onscreen interference pattern but as Tony Rome would say It's one thing you can't blame on Lyndon Johnson.    Whenever the film tries to be 'now and happening man' it simply reveals itself as hopelessly out of its depth.  Cracks like when georgia gets a coloured governor weren't funny even in 1967.  In one highly significant scene Frankie walks along a quay gazing up in bewilderment at some youngsters boogieing at an onboard disco.  The gulf between Ol' Blue Eyes and 1967 is unbridgeable.".

Her presence makes it feel like Connery's Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever. They do have great chemistry and their scenes together make for most of the film's charm. Tony Rome does have some recognizable faces and names for diehard film buffs including Gena Rowlands Simon Oakland Richard Conte a fun role for Joan Shawlee one of Billy Wilder's constant actors as a lady Sinatra interrogates and who propositions him and a rare 60s role for 193040s actor Jeffrey Lynn who you'd miss if you didn't know him. But the film's major flaw is its length and its emphasis on characters introduced late in the film which makes the viewer confused having to deal with so many interested parties in the case of the missing jewelry and of whom the viewer has not invested any interest in. Therefore the viewer is left wondering what happened and feeling rather unsatisfied. A movie similar in tone but done much better is Paul Newman's Harper. But I give it a 5 for a good beginning and Jill St. John making the most of her role.".

Sinatra is never anything less than likable  he was one of the few singers who could act his ass off and convince us that no job could ever be too difficult to master  and Tony Rome thrives off of our inability to do anything but want him to win the battle that pits him against a bunch of glamorous twofaces. It's better than his other late'60s Sam Spade imitation The Detective fearless but tiresome and it's a lot more tolerable than his later career moments that attempted to disguise him as a young buck when he in fact was a wizened old buck. It's breezy and shimmering a neonoir without all the hardcore grit of the other cop pieces of the era.In Tony Rome Sinatra's titular portrayal is put to good use as he investigates the bizarre behavior of a millionaire's daughter Sue Lyon. Middleaged tired and living on a houseboat Rome has lived the life of a detective for decades only succumbing to the tirelessness of it all in recent years. He's an ace at what he does  just don't expect him to get very involved with his clients. Because here he has three the daughter who wants his help in solving her many predicaments her father Simon Oakland and his chic wife Gena Rowlands who happens to be her distanced stepmother. Also involved in the story is Ann Archer Jill St. John a sultry divorce with little purpose besides love interest fodder.Set in Miami Beach Tony Rome has a feeling of boundless sexy heat Rome's job always seeming romantically dangerous as the thugs are always shady characters instead of people and the women are decorations made to disappear as soon as a potential sequel is announced. The film is nothing more than studio fluff meant to modernize the private detective noir era with a bona fide star leading the way no less  but it's enjoyable. Sinatra suits the role St. John providing him with a presence at once seductive and self aware.Tony Rome is much less imaginative than the darkened crime thrillers it so desperately tries to emulate but it's agreeable and well acted  a cut above many films of the late'60s which was no doubt a shaky era. So I'm not just glad Nancy Sinatra sings the title tune like the star isn't her father I'm also glad Frankie gets to put his blueeyed appeal to good use.".

	schema:reviewBody "One could make a case that 'Tony Rome' is the best private eye movie of the 1960s. Also we could argue that it's the first neonoir depending how one defines these things. In any case a lot of the film's success can be attributed to Sinatra who is just terrific. The Tony Rome persona is clearly in the tradition of the classic private detective. However Sinatra gives the character a more laid back hip quality than the usual Old School tough detectives we saw in the 1940s played by the likes of Bogart Mitchum and Dick Powell. Given the setting and lifestyle the character of Rome is also an obvious first cousin to Travis McGee of the John D. MacDonald novels. Moreover in its way the film anticipates Miami Vice of two decades later. The style and mood is more early than late 60s and there is a whiff of 007 with the lush Miami Beach backdrop zingy repartee frequent consumption of alcohol topnotch production values and beautiful women. And like the Bond films of that era some of the sensibilities are by today's standards decidedly unpc. To wit Rome's penchant for violence to the point of sadism and the depiction of most of the women characters as little more than sex objects. Still the film provides a good time capsulelike view of what Miami Beach was like a half century ago. Perhaps the best thing about TR is the cast of quirky secondary characters played to perfection by the fine supporting cast. Refreshing to see Richard Conte as a cop instead of a mobster. And Jill St. John makes for a fetching semiromantic interest for Rome. There's not much that's new in 'Tony Rome' but there's not a lot that's wrong with it either.".

It should be an easy two hundred bucks but sometime that night Diana's diamond pin has gone missing. She asks him to find it before her father finds out it has been lost but see isn't the only one looking for it a group of heavies ambush Tony on his boat and then ransack it looking for the pin. That is only the start of the matter Tony's partner is murdered in his office and later somebody takes a shot at Kosterman clearly the case is about more than a missing piece of jewellery. As the case progresses Tony gets close to beautiful redhead Ann Archer who may have been involved with the man everybody is looking for.This film is almost fifty years old so it is inevitable that it looks a little dated at times but that isn't necessarily a bad thing the violence is relatively bloodless there is no strong swearing and raciest things get is seeing Jill St. John in a bikini and some gogo dancers in a bar. There is also the accidental comedy of seeing characters on the beach wearing suits! Frank Sinatra puts in a solid performance as eponymous hero Tony Rome a likable character who has his flaws but not too many. He is ably supported by Jill St. John as Ann Archer the two have some enjoyable scenes together as she flirts with him without anything actually happening. The rest of the supporting are pretty good too. The story contains a good central mystery and the actual motive for the events doesn't become obvious before it is formally revealed and when it is revealed it makes sense. There are also some comic moments along the way every time Tony returns to his boat we hear his female neighbour encouraging somebody named Malcolm in what can only be a sexual manner when we finally see Malcolm he can barely walk! Overall I found this to be a fun film not dark enough to be Film Noir but it certainly features some of that genre's tropes.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the moment the opening credits begin with Nancy Sinatra offering a groovy swinging title song the audience is aware that they're going to get Ol' Blue Eyes in his cool Rat Pack mode. However he does bring a level of seriousness to the proceedings at least more than Dean Martin ever did to his Matt Helm series and would get even more down to earth in The Detective a short while later also directed by Douglas. Here Sinatra is the title character a boatdwelling private detective who is called upon to deliver a drunk unconscious socialite Lyon to her wealthy father Oakland. The owner of the motel she's discovered in wants to avoid publicity. This reasonably simple task opens up a huge can of worms including a sexstarved divorce St. John a nervous society wife Rowlands a skeptical police detective Conte a bickering dysfunctional couple Lynn and Cooper and a thuggish hit man Greene among many others. There are many pieces to the puzzle and interesting little side trips and twists as the answers begin to unfold. There's also a fair amount of violence and death along the way. Sinatra is worldweary and yet charming. He's also very matteroffact even when delivering some slangy zingy lines. Oakland is typically blustery while Rowlands looking sensational is more edgy. St. John shows off her spectacular bod and enjoys a nice rapport with Sinatra. Lyon is surprisingly underutilized considering some of the roles she'd played previously. Conte is a nice foil for Sinatra and would return for the sequel Lady in Cement. Veteran Lynn has a small but pivotal part. Cooper as his wife is barely given a chance to do anything. Funny man Greene is effective in his lowlife role. Lund has a bit part as a sexually aware stripper. Shawlee is fun as a chubby hooker. The appeal here is seeing Sinatra navigate the labyrinthine plot while rubbing elbows with some interesting characters and some delectable females all decked out in 1960's hair clothing and makeup. Moss Mabry drew up some very pretty gowns for the ladies and some fun things for St. John. Oddly Lyon gets a series of cookiecutter dresses that are nice but awfully simple and demure. Location filming in Miami adds to the flavor of the film a lot. A recurring joke about a honeymooning couple is punctuated by a hilariously suggestive song that's played each time they are referred to. The even seedier sequel features Raquel Welch and Dan Blocker.".

	schema:headline " Ole Blue Eyes Plays A Private Eye in Miami";
	schema:reviewBody "Gordon Douglas' Tony Rome ranks as an average whodunit that benefits immensely from Joseph Biroc's fantastic widescreen lensing in actual authentic Miami locations. First off Tony Rome is no Maltese Falcon or Big Sleep and Frank Sinatrafor all of his cool movesis no Humphrey Bogart. Nevertheless this detectives' story is complicated enough humorous enough and relies on enough gumshoe conventions to make it entertaining. What surprised me about everything that I've read here and at other Internet websites is that nobody observed that Tony Rome was the only movie that ole Blue Eyes made that had a sequel. Sinatra never played the same named character more than once except here and in Lady In Cement. Another interesting fact is that old Blue Eyes must have gotten along well with veteran helmer Gordon Douglas because Douglas directed him in Tony Rome and then The Detective and then Lady in Cement. Earlier Douglas called shots on Sinatra's Rat Pack clan gangster movie Robin and the 7 Hoods and even earlier Young at Heart. As sensitive as Sinatra was about his friends and coworkers and as ready as he was to punish them for their slights the fact that he worked with Douglas so many times must say something. Perhaps Douglas was simply compliant. Compliant or otherwise Gordon Douglas was one of those extremely efficient but rarely celebrated Hollywood helmers. Reportedly Sinatra hated to shoot a scene more than once and some directorseven Oscar winning Lewis Milestonewere content to follow his wishes. Oscar winning scenarist Richard L. Breen who penned the Barbara Stanwyck version of Titanic as well as PT109 knew a thing or two about writing hardboiled detective dialogue. He wrote enough Dragnet episodes to ensure this quality. Breen's screenplay contains some hilarious moments that do rank up there with The Big Sleep and the horse racing dialogue scene between Bogart and Lauren Bacall. In this instance a client shows up at Rome's roomy office and tries to hire him to investigate their kitty cat because pussy doesn't smile any more. I suspect that even in 1967 everybody knew that this was racy joke. Later there is a scene between a gorgeous stripper and her fat worrisome roommate. The fat roommate slaps around the curvaceous stripper and then both cry and hold each other. Tony Rome observes them with all the cynicism in the world and switches off the lights for them and leaves their trailer. Surely this must have raised some eyebrows back in 1967 especially since the Production Code Administration was on its last legs.As for the plot Tony Rome is mild compared to the classics. Miami private investigator Tony Rome does a favor for his expartner Ralph Turpin Robert J. Wilke of The Magnificent Seven at his slimy best who saved his life once. The unsavory Turpin is a house detective at a seedy hotel and he has a young drunken dame on his hands that he needs to get rid of before the Miami Police give him flak. It turns out that he rolled her for fifty bucks and he winds up paying Rome 200 to take her off his hands. The dame is pretty Diana Pines Sue Lyon of Lolita the daughter of wealthy construction magnate Rudy Kosterman Simon Oakland of Bullitt and Rome takes her home without getting Turpin in trouble. Kosterman pays off Rome to make sure that his family doesn't get in the headlines. The next day Diana shows up at Rome's houseboat. She appears to have lost a diamond stick pin valued at 5thousand and she wants it back without her father knowing about it. No sooner does she tell Rome about the pin than a couple of thugs show up and give Rome the option of a pistol butt over the head or chloroform. One nice trait of Sinatra's Tony Rome is that the guy is no hero. He chooses chloroform and the thugs trash his boat only to find zilch. Interestingly Lloyd Gough who portrayed the idiotic Sentinel news reporter on the TV series The Green Hornet plays a strongarm guy who roughs up Rome. Rome is a gambler too who often loses. Moreover his back story is that his father was a Miami cop who tangled with the wrong politician and committed suicide. Tony quit the force and earns peanuts as a private eye. Eventually Rome finds himself up to his neck in trouble with his own cop buddy Lieutenant Santini Richard Conte of The Violent Professionals because he finds Turpin shot dead in his office. Meanwhile Rome discovers that the precious pin that Pines wants recovered is made out of glass. He also suspects that Kosterman's lovely wife Rita the ever lovely Gena Rowlands has something to hide. The high point of the plot occurs when an imported gunman tries to kill Kosterman at his construction site. Shecky Greene of TV's Combat shows up briefly as a hitman who has been arrested so many times that he knows the law better than his lawyers. The fabulously beautiful Jill St. John of Diamonds Are Forever slums through several scenes with Sinatra as a threetime married vodka guzzling babe. For a while it looks like Tony Rome is going to get the girl but no such luck. She goes back to hubby number three because he has bought her a new nightgown and a new honeymoon in Nassau. Tony Rome has more plot than action and it lacks noisy gunfights car chases and nudity but it is a good Sinatra flick.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gordon Douglas' Tony Rome ranks as an average whodunit that benefits immensely from Joseph Biroc's fantastic widescreen lensing in actual authentic Miami locations. First off Tony Rome is no Maltese Falcon or Big Sleep and Frank Sinatrafor all of his cool movesis no Humphrey Bogart. Nevertheless this detectives' story is complicated enough humorous enough and relies on enough gumshoe conventions to make it entertaining. What surprised me about everything that I've read here and at other Internet websites is that nobody observed that Tony Rome was the only movie that ole Blue Eyes made that had a sequel. Sinatra never played the same named character more than once except here and in Lady In Cement. Another interesting fact is that old Blue Eyes must have gotten along well with veteran helmer Gordon Douglas because Douglas directed him in Tony Rome and then The Detective and then Lady in Cement. Earlier Douglas called shots on Sinatra's Rat Pack clan gangster movie Robin and the 7 Hoods and even earlier Young at Heart. As sensitive as Sinatra was about his friends and coworkers and as ready as he was to punish them for their slights the fact that he worked with Douglas so many times must say something. Perhaps Douglas was simply compliant. Compliant or otherwise Gordon Douglas was one of those extremely efficient but rarely celebrated Hollywood helmers. Reportedly Sinatra hated to shoot a scene more than once and some directorseven Oscar winning Lewis Milestonewere content to follow his wishes. Oscar winning scenarist Richard L. Breen who penned the Barbara Stanwyck version of Titanic as well as PT109 knew a thing or two about writing hardboiled detective dialogue. He wrote enough Dragnet episodes to ensure this quality.

It is largely a plot and dialogue driven film and luckily both elements deliver the plot is appropriately convoluted and twisted but still followable and the dialogue is sharp snappy and sometimes very funny Oh I get it. She's the mother and you're the grandmother or First Diana hires me then her father hires me and now you wanna hire me. If you had a bigger family I could retire!. Sinatra plays the private detective role with a welljudged mixture of seriousness and humor cynicism and ethics toughness and fatigue. Jill St. John begins as an independent smart character just like her more famous role in the Bond outing Diamonds Are Forever the welcome difference is that in Tony Rome she stays that way to the end. The rest of the cast is solid. The Miami locations are wellused they're not just background they give the film its own character. Even if it's not the most exciting thriller of its decade or anything I would still recommend Tony Rome to any Frank Sinatra  mystery fans. 12".

She has to be the biggest Robsessed Twilightsessed twentytwo year old out there and it was her birthday last week so I being the good friend I am decided to put myself through two hours of torture on her behalf. Turns out I didn't have to.I think I've made it clear that I did not like any of the actorsactresses particularly nor did I like any of the moviesTV shows any of the actorsactresses had done in the past. That being said I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of emotion the movie brought to me. One minute I'd be laughing like a hyena and the next I'd be nearly in tears. It truly was an emotional roller coaster. Perhaps I didn't give the tween heartthrob vampire enough credit because if there was a single thing I noticed in the part of me that wasn't overcome with emotion it was that Robert Pattinson stood out. He made me feel the happiness the pain the excitement and most likely will make you feel them too unless you're a coldhearted jerk. He actually is an actor not just some semigood looking guy who happened to be noticed for his semigood looks. The Twilight movies do not do him justice.Although my friend will forever hold this against me I must say you the reader should see this movie. I've seen the movie critics' reviews for this movie and I know they say this movie is a waste of time and money but that is because they are looking at the separate parts of the movie. Allow me to explain. Have you seen The Sound of Music? When The Sound of Music was released it raised a lot of controversy. Some critics said it was too saccharine others said the plot was pointless yet not one of them could explain why every person who watched the movie fell in love with it or why each of them had a copy stashed under their bed. Why was it so popular? It had all the components of a bad musical kiddish songs fairytale romance nothing bad. Even the Nazi chasing the family scene was not very intense. So why did people like it? The problem was the movie critics were looking at the separate parts not the movie as a whole. A movie can be judged by its separate parts and most of the time it is but one must also consider the glue that holds the separate parts together. A house made of bricks would fall down without the mortar. It is the same with this movie. The critics say this part was too sad this part too happy they don't fit. They are analyzing the movie too logically. Sometimes the best movies are the ones that touch your emotions it doesn't have to be explained. Give this movie a chance. It will touch your heart and if you are like my friend leave you bawling.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film definitely Robert Pattinson's most profound is not to be taken or experienced lightly. It is a heavy drama that is less about romance than it is about family loss amidst tragedy. It is also the first film to surprise me in a very long time. I had no idea how it would conclude until about three minutes from the ending which absolutely blew me away.I went to see it with my girlfriend and we had been waiting for it for a long time. We both expected it to be good but what we were really hoping for was a Pattinson performance that demonstrated something beyond the level of range exhibited in his interpretation of Stephanie Meyer's lackluster antihero Edward Cullen. Needless to say we got a lot more than we bargained for. Shockingly not only did Pattinson easily eclipse both Pierce Brosnan's and Chris Cooper's performances as the two fathers of the story which were both excellent but he gave us something we will remember for a very long time. This is definitely the most powerful film I have seen in theaters over the past year. It reaches far beyond the limited emotional scope of bigger releases such as 'Avatar' or 'Shutter Island' both of which are disastrously overrated. What 'Remember Me' accomplishes with its riveting noholdsbarred storytelling and its brilliant final sequence is a feat rarely if ever attempted so tastefully. It connects us with so many aspects of our reality our own world and our own history that many of us try not to face. It forces us to examine what certain significant events mean in the progression of our lives and the lives of our families and friends. It examines how we relate to one another in both the simplest and most complex of our relationships. It ties our daily lives together with the unexpected which is something that is often unavoidable whether we are prepared for it or not. And it provides us with some insight as to how to deal with our hardships in life. It doesn't give us all the answers as no film or book or story of any kind could ever do but it certainly inspires us to ask the tough questions.".

I am wowed by the movie stunned truly...

Robert Pattinson Emile DeRavin and cast are brilliant and it is without a doubt the most powerful and jaw dropping film I've seen in quite some time.

It fails to be either of these.Then to add insult to injury the choice of ending that is used to get one last emotional response from the audience is inappropriate and has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of movie.Whatever you do will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it.

If you are not a huge fan of Twilight  Pattinson you might not be impressed of his acting I found it really bad. Then there was the script the story was not believable I mean I don't think people in real life would react the way they did in some of the situations. I had the feeling that the writer wanted to get them in certain situations but didn't know how to do that in a natural way so he exaggerated a lot in character traits in reactions in lines. So instead of relating to them and their sad feelings I was annoyed by them. I couldn't get their anger I just felt they were stupid. I was left with absolutely nothing after watching an hour and 20 minutes of this movie  that being the moment I stopped watching. I wasn't even curious of how it ends or whatever happens to them all I could think of was how I wasted a Friday evening. Maybe younger people I'm 26 relate better to all this maybe I've seen too many movies and lived too many situations by now to still be impressed by this.".

It is a complex multilayered story that subtly draws you into the lives of two families who are living with and dealing with how tragedy has defined them. Don't mistake this as simply a chick flick or love story. It is a portrait of the impact of human beings. By the end of the movie which was spoiled for me in advance but no less powerful I was completely invested in the characters. The entire cast was incredible and Robert Pattinson very capably showed that he has talent that will sustain him far beyond Twilight. The actors were outstanding as they delivered performances that were warm gritty authentic and endearing. As a side note about the surprise ending I felt the emotional punch but I feel that it was tastefully done.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I bought this DVD I had no definitive idea what the story was about i'd not seen any trailers. From the cover I suspected it was a romance and as the store was doing buy ten get two free I picked it up. It sat on the DVD rack for three weeks before I got around to watching it. The film is about 1 hour and 57 minutes long.The opening scene is of a robbery turned murder of a woman on a queens subway station platform in 1991. Then we jump forward ten years. For the next ten minutes we're rapidly bombarded with a whole bunch of new characters in such a tenuous way that we're pretty much left to figure out who's who and how they are connected for ourselves. In fact the character introductions and development is almost as random as throwing dice. Eventually they land on the films romantic interest Tyler and Ali.Tyler's family has been torn apart by the suicide of his elder brother and Tyler seems to claw through life in a mixture of rage and self pity. Ali who's mother we saw being murdered on the subway platform in the opening scene seems other than for witnessing her own mother's murder to be a fairly non descript person. The acting is weak throughout the cast Tyler and his roomie in particular are quite irritating. The dialogue bland and unimaginative. A scene develops where Ali tells Tyler her mother was murdered and he doesn't even ask one single question about it but simply brushes it aside and moves on to another subject. None of the characters are developed enough to make you care about them Tyler's mother and stepfathermother's boyfriend  we don't know which he is it's that vague are so distant to us they might as well be extras. Those whom are developed  such as Tyler's father and Ali's father are both completely anti social and simply not particularly likable anyway. So here we are rambling through a film going absolutely nowhere about people we don't much care for in what could best be described as a celluloid over indulgent quagmire with little if any saving graces.SPOILERS At 1 hour and 38 minutes I actually asked myself does this film have any point to it? then at 1 hour and 44 minutes in a classroom scene the teacher has written on the blackboard Tuesday September 11 2001 and the first thought that went through my mind was oh for goodness sake that's what it's about. The film ran on for another ten minutes needless to say what the end was about how the lives of the various characters were affected blah blah blahetc.. etc.. Was this an intentional twist? Were we supposed to feel sympathy for the characters we don't like just because of a tragedy? Or did the director actually think we'd care about these nothing irritating people? Using the image of Tyler standing looking out a window of one of the World Trade Centre towers was probably supposed to be powerful tragic ending but it just seemed pathetic weak and quite frankly all a bit tawdry. I'm sure the American's loved this film got all upset and tragic over it but for the rest of us it's just total over indulgent wk basically. Still I expect Hollywood will continue to churn out low grade self indulgent feel sorry for us films about 911 for the next twenty years like they did Vietnam and I doubt this will be the worst Adam Sandler's Reign Over Me already tops this for sheer cness.If you're not from the US honestly don't bother to watch this because it's absolute rubbish.210".

	schema:reviewBody "There ought to be a law against using the tragedy of September 11 2001 for cheap manipulative teen drivel. There I said it. This film ends with the attacks on 911. Now there's absolutely no reason for anyone to waste 2 hours of their life to watch this derivative piece of crap. This is a badly written badly directed and badly acted film. Which is not surprising because when the movie ends you realize that it was only ever conceived as an ending 911 to begin with. The movie was loosely sorted out later as an afterthought to justify it. It is essentially an ending in search of a movie... I cannot believe that this garbage ever got backing. One can only conclude that this was dreamed up as a way to capitalize on Robert Pattinson's popularity. This movie genre is not new or necessarily bad. It's about teen angst Romeo and Juliet Legend of Billie Jean Rebel Without a Cause... Nothing new. There've been many before. Some very good. There'll be many in the future. But the plot points of this script are ridiculous. It really jumps the shark when Pattinson's character's little sister gets her hair chopped off at a birthday party for no reason by a bunch of mean girls. She's traumatized so he takes her to school the next day as her protector and in front of her class and her teacher whips up on one of her female classmates another 9 year old for saying Did you do something different with your hair? And then hurls a fire extinguisher through the classroom door and out into the hallway. And even though he committed battery on a child terrorized a whole classroom full of children and vandalized a school he's able to be bailed out once again by the father he hates because he earns a living what a bad man. In the real world you do serious time for something like that because a grown man who would push a small girl around even if she's a mean girl has serious problems and can never be a hero in a movie. What's even worse about this bad movie is that is uses 911 in order to pretend to be something more than it is. The writer of this mess Fetters and the director Coulter ought to be ashamed of themselves. If they can't make a decent movie at least have the decency not to cheapen the tragedy of 911 in order to provide substance to an otherwise B grade film.".

	schema:reviewBody "RKO's Out Of The Past 1947 is regarded by many as the finest Noir ever to come out of Hollywood. But CROSSFIRE made just prior to it the same year was a fair contender for that coveted title. Produced by Adrain Scott for RKO the recognized home of Noir it was magically photographed in beautifully defined black and white by J.Roy Hunt. Written for the screen by John Paxton from a novel by Richard Brooks it was stylishly directed by Edward Dmytryk and was fleshed out with an imaginative cast headed by the three Roberts  Young Mitchum and Ryan plus Gloria Grahame Sam Levene and Paul Kelly.A Jew Levene is murdered in a hotel room by antiSemitic GI Montgomery Robert Ryan leading to pipe smoking detective Robert Young investigating three soldiers who are suspects. Interestingly in the original novel it is a homosexual that is murdered but in 1947 homosexuality was very much a taboo subject to put on the screen so the murder victim was changed to be Jewish. The change had little effect on the story's impact for it is still a dynamic and potent drama.CROSSFIRE is not only a fascinating well produced motion picture but it also has a fascinating look to it. Taking place entirely at night the deserted dark wet streets filmed with a bugeyed lens together with the shadow filled interiors make for some of the most startling and vibrantly shot sequences ever seen in pictures. Also though it is sparsely scored by RKO's resident Noir composer Roy Webb there is a thundering and punchy Main Title and a reflective love theme. Webb must have been saving himself for his masterpiece Out Of The Past which would come later that year. Also heard in the night club scenes in CROSSFIRE is the great New Orleans trombonist Kid Ory 18861973 And His Creole Jazz Band uncredited playing some wonderful jazz numbers. And later in Grahame's apartment Ory can be heard again on the radio playing the marvellous Jelly Roll Morton composition Whinin' Boy Blues which lends a persuasive atmosphere to the drab surroundings.Performances are generally good! Robert Young is excellent in what is probably his best remembered role as the detective. But disappointing and wasted is Robert Mitchum! He doesn't really have very much to do in what amounts to nothing more than being cast in a sombre and subdued role. The acting honours however must go to Robert Ryan's blistering performance as Montgomery the violent Jew hating GI. His sneaky and scary portrayal deservedly earned him an Acadamy Award nomination. Also effective is Sam Levene as Samuels the illfated Jew and Gloria Grahame as the girl in the night club who picks up the naive George Cooper. And watch out too for a young Lex Barker in one of his first film appearances.Not as good as the magnificent Out Of The Past that came later that year but still an engrossing and tight little thriller from that once great RKO studio in Hollywood who produced exceptional movies that we can never forget and which now sadly Hollywood itself seems to have forgotten.".

'Crossfire' is a message movie but it is also a cracking good drama and that's what I enjoyed about it. Plus the cast is dynamite  Roberts Preston Mitchum and Ryan and the beautiful Gloria Grahame 'In A Lonely Place'. Mitchum doesn't have a big a role as you might expect the movie was released the same year as 'Out Of The Past' in which he gives a much more substantial performance but he's always great to watch and Robert Ryan 'The Wild Bunch' steals the movie as a very nasty piece of work. I find many 1940s romance and comedy movies to be too corny for my taste but the crime movies are much more to my liking. They are usually grittier and more realistic and 'Crossfire' is a great example of this. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " A study of hate crime through the lens of film noir";
	schema:reviewBody "As a rule there are few things more dispiriting than Hollywood's attempts to be courageous. Mixing caution with heavyhandedness message movies pat themselves loudly on the back for daring to tackle major problems. CROSSFIRE is not entirely free from this taint it includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious assuming a level of naivity in its audience that's depressing to contemplate. As late as 1947 it was a big deal for a movie to announce that antiSemitism existed and that it was bad. It was unthinkable of course for Hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the movie was basedits victim was a homosexual. Nevertheless thanks to good writing and excellent acting CROSSFIRE remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crime.Postwar malaise was one of the major components of film noir and CROSSFIRE addresses it directly. The film is set in Washington D.C. among soldiers still in uniform but idle spending their days playing poker and barcrawling. Joseph Samuels Sam Levene an intelligent and kindly Jew explains that the end of the war has created a void all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now unfocused and bottled up. Samuels meets three soldiers in a bar the sensitive Mitchell who is close to a nervous breakdown the weakwilled Floyd Bowers and Montgomery a tall overbearing bully who nastily belittles a young soldier from Tennessee as a stupid hillbilly. The three soldiers wind up at Samuels' apartment where the drunken Monty becomes increasingly abusive calling his host Jewboy. Samuels is beaten to death and Mitchell disappears making himself the prime suspect for the killing.Unraveling the crime are Detective Finlay Robert Young dry and bythebook and Sergeant Keeley Robert Mitchum a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows Mitchell is incapable of murder. Among the pieces of the puzzle are Ginny Gloria Grahame a nightclub hostess who met Mitchell and gave him her apartment key and Floyd Steve Brodie who as a witness to the crime holes up terrified in a seedy rooming house. While there is no real whodunit suspense the story remains gripping and the trap laid for the killer is extremely clever.The strong noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling didactic or sanctimonious. The cinematography is a striking shadowplay with inky darks and harsh lights rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. Worldweariness is as pervasive as noir lighting. Nothing interests me Finlay says quietly To nothing is Ginny's toast in the nightclub. Gloria Grahame the paragon of noir femininity nearly steals the movie with her two scenes. Platinumblonde jaded and caustic she's the quintessential Bgirl poisoned by the stinking gin mill where she works for laughs she says bitterly her sweet face curdling when Mitchell tells her that she reminds him of his wife. Now and then a wistful kindness peeks through her defensive shell as when she dances with Mitchell in a deserted courtyard then offers to cook him spaghetti at her apartment. When he goes there he meets a weasely crumplefaced man Paul Kelly who seems to sponge off Ginny and whose conversation is a dense layering of lies and false confessions. Gloria blows Mitchell's goodgirl wife off the screen in a scene where she's asked to give Mitchell an alibi. Slim and frail in her bathrobe with her girlish lisp she lets us see just how often Ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a tramp.Robert Young is a nondescript actor and he stands no chance against Mitchum's charisma but he does a good job of keeping his pipesmoking character saddled with delivering the movie's earnest message this side of pompousness. Mitchum meanwhile gets some cool dialogue but not nearly enough to do still even when he's doing nothing but lounging in a corner you can't take your eyes off him. The third Robert Ryan creates a fully shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant unstable bigot we see his phony geniality his bullying his resentment of anyone with advantages his Am I right or am I right? smugness how easily he slaps labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising them.CROSSFIRE's message seems cautious and dated now though not nearly so much as the same year's A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. Finlay's speech about bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white victimhood reminding us that Irish Catholics were once persecuted next it could be people from Tennessee he says or men who wear striped neckties. Or maybe blacks or Japanese or homosexuals or communists? The script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems. It sweetens its message by making the Jewish victim saintly as though his innocence were not sufficient and it takes care to exonerate the military having a superior officer declare that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery and stressing that Samuels served honorably in the war. Still it did take some guts to depict immediately after World War II an American who might have been happier in the Nazi army and the movie's basic premise is still valid. If Monty were alive today he would have gone out on September 12 2001 and beat up a Sikh.".

Slim and frail in her bathrobe with her girlish lisp she lets us see just how often Ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a tramp.Robert Young is a nondescript actor and he stands no chance against Mitchum's charisma but he does a good job of keeping his pipesmoking character saddled with delivering the movie's earnest message this side of pompousness. Mitchum meanwhile gets some cool dialogue but not nearly enough to do still even when he's doing nothing but lounging in a corner you can't take your eyes off him. The third Robert Ryan creates a fully shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant unstable bigot we see his phony geniality his bullying his resentment of anyone with advantages his Am I right or am I right? smugness how easily he slaps labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising them.CROSSFIRE's message seems cautious and dated now though not nearly so much as the same year's A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. Finlay's speech about bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white victimhood reminding us that Irish Catholics were once persecuted next it could be people from Tennessee he says or men who wear striped neckties. Or maybe blacks or Japanese or homosexuals or communists? The script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems. It sweetens its message by making the Jewish victim saintly as though his innocence were not sufficient and it takes care to exonerate the military having a superior officer declare that the army is ashamed of men like Montgomery and stressing that Samuels served honorably in the war. Still it did take some guts to depict immediately after World War II an American who might have been happier in the Nazi army and the movie's basic premise is still valid. If Monty were alive today he would have gone out on September 12 2001 and beat up a Sikh.";

	schema:reviewBody "Crossfire feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece  it's well acted and beautifully filmed but thinly written and way too short. As is it's just a decent police procedural with hints of film noir at its zenith in 1947 and social commentary also trendy at the time thrown in for good measure. It's remembered today as one of the first two Hollywood films to deal with antiSemitism and as being much better than the similarlythemed Gentleman's Agreement no mean feat. But its real subject is the difficulty that WWII soldiers as trained killers were having as they made the transition to civilian life. For a more genteel take on this topic try The Best Years Of Our Lives. A man is beaten to death in the first few frames of the film. We do not see his attacker. The movie is about the investigation of this murder which is actually pretty straightforward but it takes some unnecessary detours like when the main suspect a depressed soldier winds up in the apartment of Gloria Grahame a dancehall hooker with a really weird pimp played by Paul Kelly. There's also a civics lecture halfway through the movie that slows the proceedings to a crawl and the ending is tidy enough for a cop show. But otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery. Still what a great noir it could have been. Director Edward Dmytryk drops a few hints at the subject of the original novel  homosexuality not antiSemitism  like when sadistic creep Monty seethes at the image of his friend Mitch talking with a strange man at a bar. And the cast is excellent. Robert Ryan makes for a very credible cretin and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes not unlike Peter Lorre as the child murderer in M. He deserved an Oscar but lost to Edmund Gwenn that year you can't beat Santa Claus. Robert Mitchum is onhand as a soldier friend of the accused killer. Was Mitchum a great actor or a great star? Someone else can figure that out but his sleepy eyes and bemused halfsmile work very well here since they imply that his character knows something everyone else doesn't. And he does. And Robert Young as the detective assigned to the murder is surprisingly gritty discarding his usual avuncular affability even when he has to deliver the civilrights sermon midway through the picture. There's no question that Bogart or Tracy would have been brilliant in the role but neither of them were at RKO in 1947 so you'll just have to deal with Dr. Welby. Still Young is good enough to make you wish someone had cast him in a detective drama instead of Father Knows Best which he hated and which drove him to alcoholism and suicide attempts. The man deserved better than smarm and Sanka.".

	schema:headline " Redefining the Enemy";
	schema:reviewBody "Unlike most film noir Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire adapted from a novel by Richard Brooks is not nearly as concerned with its murder mystery which at first sight might seem superficially formulaic to the casual viewer as it is with the complex motives of its characters and the oppressive ambience of its accurately rendered postWWII setting evoking feelings of disorientation loneliness and entrapment. Under its classic noir exterior it is about hardened and aloof veterans' struggle with postwar reintegration utterly unable or unwilling to put their traumatic experiences behind them and about their desperate attempt to redefine their goals. For those who define themselves by who their enemies are such as hateful loner Montgomery the brilliant Robert Ryan this necessitates establishing a new one a role filled here by Jewish intellectual Joseph Samuels Sam Levene who becomes the regrettable victim of a senseless hate crime.At first the film appears to simply be going through the motions After the ambiguously shot opening murder scene all evidence points for reasons I cannot presently remember to Corporal Arthur Mitchell George Cooper. Captain Finley Robert Young investigates and is soon joined by the idealistic Sergeant Peter Keeley Robert Mitchum who is certain of Mitchell's innocence. Two minor military characters Floyd Bowers Steve Brodie and Bill Williams Richard Benedict are also somehow involved. Monty murders the former while the latter after a stern Hugh Beaumontesque talkingto reluctantly aids Finley and Keeley in setting a trap for the dastardly ne'erdowell. Or perhaps it was the other way around  I watch so many movies that Bowers and Williams might as well have been stranded in the South Seas and mistaken for Gods by the natives. Or possibly they have to spend a night in a haunted house before they can claim their inheritance where they find a monkey that can play baseball and helps the local team win some games. At any rate there's also the obligatory femme fatale Ginny Tremaine Gloria Grahame and a compulsive liar Paul Kelly delivering a wonderful performance who might or might not be her husband and exists mostly for local color and comic relief.However the real meat of the piece is the complex characterization of the veteran archetypes. Mitchell for instance suffers from a classic case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder often also referred to as shell shock' war neurosis' or combat stress' and like many suffering from this condition is taunted and branded as a coward by his fellows. He has become utterly selfloathing and fears the return to normalcy. The scene in which is wife finally gets him to confront these fears and enables him to return to her and his art is one of the film's many highlights. Then there's Peter Keeley perhaps the most positive military archetype on display here the natural born leader. He is extremely charismatic and persuasive has great concern and compassion for his fellow soldiers and manages to bring out these qualities in others. It is Keeley's considerable understanding of both human nature and his compatriots' dilemma that makes him so valuable to Captain Finley the only other character of equivalent moral fiber. Their polar counterpart is Montgomery a sadistic racist bully who vents his frustrations by mocking and humiliating his fellow men. Left without an enemy he creates elaborate rationalizations to justify his hate for a substitute. This really could be the member of any marginally different group in the novel I am told the victim is a homosexual but in this case it happens to be a Jew. While one's initial reaction might be that Montgomery obviously fought on the wrong side during the war it is important to remember that at the time antiSemitism was far from limited to Nazi Germany. Indeed after World War One the financial and societal crisis of the Great Depression caused antiSemitism to reach its zenith and violent attacks on Jews were quite commonplace in many major cities. Later the U.S. refused entry to countless GermanJewish refugees interpreted by Hitler as a clear sign of approval for his Final Solution.Still as Captain Finley correctly points out practically anyone would have done as a victim for someone like Montgomery.".

	onyx:emotionText "Unlike most film noir Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire adapted from a novel by Richard Brooks is not nearly as concerned with its murder mystery which at first sight might seem superficially formulaic to the casual viewer as it is with the complex motives of its characters and the oppressive ambience of its accurately rendered postWWII setting evoking feelings of disorientation loneliness and entrapment. Under its classic noir exterior it is about hardened and aloof veterans' struggle with postwar reintegration utterly unable or unwilling to put their traumatic experiences behind them and about their desperate attempt to redefine their goals. For those who define themselves by who their enemies are such as hateful loner Montgomery the brilliant Robert Ryan this necessitates establishing a new one a role filled here by Jewish intellectual Joseph Samuels Sam Levene who becomes the regrettable victim of a senseless hate crime.At first the film appears to simply be going through the motions After the ambiguously shot opening murder scene all evidence points for reasons I cannot presently remember to Corporal Arthur Mitchell George Cooper. Captain Finley Robert Young investigates and is soon joined by the idealistic Sergeant Peter Keeley Robert Mitchum who is certain of Mitchell's innocence. Two minor military characters Floyd Bowers Steve Brodie and Bill Williams Richard Benedict are also somehow involved. Monty murders the former while the latter after a stern Hugh Beaumontesque talkingto reluctantly aids Finley and Keeley in setting a trap for the dastardly ne'erdowell. Or perhaps it was the other way around  I watch so many movies that Bowers and Williams might as well have been stranded in the South Seas and mistaken for Gods by the natives. Or possibly they have to spend a night in a haunted house before they can claim their inheritance where they find a monkey that can play baseball and helps the local team win some games. At any rate there's also the obligatory femme fatale Ginny Tremaine Gloria Grahame and a compulsive liar Paul Kelly delivering a wonderful performance who might or might not be her husband and exists mostly for local color and comic relief.However the real meat of the piece is the complex characterization of the veteran archetypes. Mitchell for instance suffers from a classic case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder often also referred to as shell shock' war neurosis' or combat stress' and like many suffering from this condition is taunted and branded as a coward by his fellows. He has become utterly selfloathing and fears the return to normalcy. The scene in which is wife finally gets him to confront these fears and enables him to return to her and his art is one of the film's many highlights. Then there's Peter Keeley perhaps the most positive military archetype on display here the natural born leader. He is extremely charismatic and persuasive has great concern and compassion for his fellow soldiers and manages to bring out these qualities in others. It is Keeley's considerable understanding of both human nature and his compatriots' dilemma that makes him so valuable to Captain Finley the only other character of equivalent moral fiber. Their polar counterpart is Montgomery a sadistic racist bully who vents his frustrations by mocking and humiliating his fellow men. Left without an enemy he creates elaborate rationalizations to justify his hate for a substitute. This really could be the member of any marginally different group in the novel I am told the victim is a homosexual but in this case it happens to be a Jew. While one's initial reaction might be that Montgomery obviously fought on the wrong side during the war it is important to remember that at the time antiSemitism was far from limited to Nazi Germany. Indeed after World War One the financial and societal crisis of the Great Depression caused antiSemitism to reach its zenith and violent attacks on Jews were quite commonplace in many major cities. Later the U.S. refused entry to countless GermanJewish refugees interpreted by Hitler as a clear sign of approval for his Final Solution.Still as Captain Finley correctly points out practically anyone would have done as a victim for someone like Montgomery.";

But as detective Finlay digs deeper into the case he finds that they could be barking up the wrong tree and that this crime is dealing with something desperately sad and vile antiSemitism.Crossfire was born out of the novel written by Richard Brooks adapted by John Paxton and directed by the shrewdly excellent Edward Dmtryk. Crossfire originaly titled Cradle Of Fear is a taut and gripping picture that boldly tackles antiSemitism. Tho the makers were forced to tone down the story from the original source the novel is about homosexual hatred as opposed to antiSemitism what remains largely due to RKO supremo Dore Schary and producer Adrian Scott is a sort of creeping unease that drips with noirish style.The cast features three Bob's Young Mitchum and Ryan with noir darling Gloria Grahame adding the emotional female heart. Tho only third billed it's Robert Ryan's picture all the way his portrayal as the bullying conniving Montgomery is from the top draw and perfectly showcases the talent that he had in abundance. Ryan had good cause to give Montgomery some of is best work for he had served in the Marine's with Richard Brooks himself both men having discussed the possibility that if the novel was to be made into a film then Ryan wanted in and to play Montgomery. Thus the genesis of Ryan's career as weasel types was well and truly born!Gloria Grahame also puts in a wonderful and heartfelt turn which is all the more remarkable since she was being plagued by her abusive husband at the time one Stanley Clements. He was known to be violent towards her and his constant presence around the set irked other members of the cast but Grahame probably channelling real life emotion became the character of Ginny and shone very bright indeed. Both Bob Mitchum and Bob Young come out with flying colours as well to really seal the deal on what proves to be a smartly acted picture. Tho Crossfire was released before the other 1947 antiSemitic picture Gentleman's Agreement and raking in over a million and a quarter dollars at the box office some of its thunder was stolen by the Academy Award winning picture from Fox Studio. Nominated for Best Picture Best Supporting Actor Ryan Best Supporting Actress Grahame Best Director and Best Screenplay it won nothing. But critics of the time hailed it as a brilliant shift in American Cinema and today it stands tall proud and dark as a bold and excellent piece of work. 8.510".

And to be honest Sam Levene is written as a gay guy who picks up a drunken soldier. But okay you have to go with the flow. Consider 1947. Not even antiSemitism has been treated on screen yet. Many of the people responsible for contemporary movies were themselves Jews but antiSemitism had been verboten for years because it was considered unpleasant. So we can hardly blame the makers of this film for not leaving the victim a homosexual. Now that's REALLY unpleasant  and besides there might have been many among the audience rooting for Robert Ryan to get away with it. We are by no means free of prejudice but we've still come a long way since 1947.Watching this again for the first time in years I was impressed with the rather slow pace of the first half of the movie the many shots of two people talking the shadows the time that passes between the question and the answer the uninspired editing. But I could live with that because of the film's subject matter and because of a few other things.One of the things that keep me glued to events as they unfold so deliberately is Robert Ryan's performance. The guy does a splendid job. At times he can seem thoughtful cheerfully subordinate and helpful to the police  Any way I can help yes sir. Then alone or with another soldier the simmering hatred rises to the top not so much through what he says but the way he LOOKS. That scowl that penetrating stare those dark eyes glittering. Wow.The film has taken a lot of heat because of Robert Young's preachy speech about his Grandfather's murder. That doesn't bother me at all although I guess Dmytryk didn't have to have Young shove his face into the camera while talking about MICKS and PAPISTS. Still taking the context into account it's one of the more shocking moments of the film. Part of its impact is due to Young's almost casual delivery of the message and part of it is due to the message's not having been heard on screen before.Another feature of the film that transforms it almost into the surreal is the Paul Kelly character and his relationship to the whore Gloria Grahame. Holy Guacamole what elliptical conversation Kelly is given to. You know what I told you? All those things I just told you? They're all lies. His character neatly crosses pathos with creepiness. It's impossible to know what to make of him. He adds virtually nothing to the plot but the movie would be a lot less without his presence.It's a moody murky film. Its people live in the dark. And there is murder afoot. Practically no one screams or shouts. The horror that these men have experienced and that some of them still carry with them like malaria seems just beneath the surface.See it if you have a chance.".

Grahame however is given a real chance to show why she's a noir favorite. The scene where she defends her dignity before the eyes of the law Finlay is a little gem of wounded pride.

I wonder what became of him. All in all it's apparent that director Dmytryk's operative instruction is to lowkey it which an emotionless Robert Young for one really takes to heart.The movie itself generates some suspense and has all the visual trappings of noir but the characters remain little more than instruments of the message. An interesting exception is Paul Kelly's husband. What a strange character who kind of drifts in and out as if he's trying to find the right set.

No wonder that the film's initial victim a veteran whose murder the story was built around was able to break through Mitchell's fog and help him verbalize his sense of bewilderment.I found Robert Young's detective to be keen aware of his own weaknesses and strengths in his job as dedicated to his work and keeping his pipe lit as the servicemen were to theirs although in the film's Washington DC cops and MPs were the heavies always keeping an eye on the soldiers who were just marking time no longer having anything positive to contribute to society.Crossfire moved along at a steady pace never rushed.  The editing was pleasingly crisp notably superior to most films of it genre with superb matched action shots.  Long takes and invisible camera movement were successfully employed during lengthy monologues.Whatever the relationship might have been between Paul Kelly's character Mr. Tremaine and Gloria Graehme's Ginny his inventions made for comic relief.SPOILER  Mitchell is hiding out in a movie theater sitting in the last row of the balcony.  His face is blank lifeless uninterested in the cinema with its sweet orchestral soundtrack.  Unbeknownst to Mitchell his wife climbs the balcony steps seeking him out.  The music builds to a crescendo as Mrs. Mitchell approaches her husband.  He turns to screen left his face revealing surprise and a never before seen smile as he sees her.

	schema:headline " Corrosive Nature Of Hate";
	schema:reviewBody "Crossfire is one of those films from the Forties that is crying for a remake if for no other reason than maybe it's time it should be done as originally written. The story on which the film is based is about the killing of a gay man. But antiSemitism was certainly a hot topic in the days of post World War II with the holocaust fresh in everyone's mind.In the Lee Server biography of Robert Mitchum Edward Dmytryk the director was interviewed and and bluntly said that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against gays at the time with The Code firmly in place. It could have been though because the character of Robert Ryan is such an equal opportunity hater of everything that deviates from his societal norms.Mitchum was told in no uncertain terms that he was in the film strictly for the ride. Robert Young was cast as the Washington DC Police homicide captain who catches the case and while Mitchum was second billed he knew from the beginning the film would belong to Ryan. But he was RKO's new star by dint of his performances in The Story Of GI Joe and Till The End Of Time so he was there for box office insurance. Mitchum's part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case George Cooper.Crossfire is not a whodunit even though we don't see the crime it becomes clear that Montgomery is the one who kills Sam Levene the quintessential Jewish salesperson. And it becomes clear to Young and Mitchum that Ryan is the guilty party almost as fast as it does to the audience. It becomes just a question of getting the evidence.Ryan earned one of several Academy Award nominations the film garnered his Best Supporting Actor category. Though he lost to Edmund Gwenn the film was Ryan's breakthrough role. Similarly Gloria Grahame was nominated for a brief part as a party girl for Best Supporting Actress but she lost to Celeste Holm for Gentleman's Agreement. In fact Crossfire ran up against Gentleman's Agreement and lost for Best Picture and Best director for Dmytryk to Elia Kazan. It's fifth nomination for Best Screenplay and Crossfire came up short again with the winner being Miracle on 34th Street.Gloria Grahame also had her own problems on the set which spilled over from her personal life. She was having big trouble with her then husband Stanley Clements who was an abusive husband. He was hanging around the set causing Ed Dmytryk a lot of problems. Fortunately Grahame's part was a small one. In fact the whole film was shot in typical RKO economy style in 20 days.Robert Young has a particularly fine scene with William Phipps a young kid from Tennessee in Mitchum and Ryan's outfit who Ryan constantly belittles. Young is most eloquent in speaking about the corrosive nature of hate and how it affected his family as Irish Catholics who came over in the potato famine years. It was one of Robert Young's best moments on screen in his long career.As fine a film as Crossfire is it's time to be remade as a story about an antigay hate crime. Especially with the real killing of Barry Winchell from the last decade and the debate about gays in the military.That's a film who's time has come and almost gone.".

	schema:headline " Ignorance Intolerance  Irony";
	schema:reviewBody "Crossfire is ostensibly a murder mystery but what distinguishes it from other similar movies of the period is the killer's motive which is antiSemitism. The story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance which fuels bigotry and contains references to a hillbilly and an Irish immigrant who also suffered maltreatment because of their ethnicity.The movie's plot is based on Richard Brooks' novel called The Brick Foxhole which is about a hate crime where the victim was gay. It's ironic that this story about a form of intolerance should be met with intolerance by the censors who stipulated that for the screen version the type of bigotry involved should be changed to antiSemitism. Another irony is the behaviour of a soldier who seems fiercely proud of having served in a war against the Nazis and yet embraces their hatred of Jews. The director and producer of this movie also suffered another type of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being called to appear before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. All these points just seem to underline the deeply entrenched and intractable nature of the whole problem of bigotry as depicted in this movie.When Police Captain Finlay Robert Young investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels Sam Levene he discovers that on the night when he was killed Samuels had been socialising with a group of soldiers and one of these Corporal Arthur Mitch Mitchell George Cooper is quickly identified as the prime suspect. Further information is also gathered from Montgomery Robert Ryan who is another of the soldiers who was present that night and Sergeant Keeley Robert Mitchum who's a friend of Mitchell. Keeley with the help of some other soldiers then searches for Mitchell and when he finds him hears his account of what he did on the night of the murder including his meeting with a dance hall hostess called Ginny Tremaine Gloria Grahame.Keeley helps Michell to avoid being arrested and tries to identify the murderer. Ginny Tremaine is questioned but her information is insufficient to prove Mitchell's innocence but Finlay's investigations lead him to recognise the motive for the crime and subsequently he sets up an elaborate trap which leads the real culprit into exposing his own guilt.Crossfire is a movie with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed at a very early stage in the story. The message is conveyed in a way which was no doubt appropriate for the period in which it was made but by today's standards seems rather heavy handed. The cinematography by J Roy Hunt is just wonderful with low key lighting and creative use of numerous strategically placed table lamps combining to evoke a look which is perfectly compatible with the drama being played out on screen.Despite it being a low budget production Crossfire was a great box office success and benefited from having an absorbing and very relevant story with a marvellous cast two of whom were nominated for Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor Robert Ryan and Best Supporting Actress Gloria Grahame. The additional nominations for Edward Dmytryk Best Director producer Adrian Scott Best Picture and John Paxton Best Writing Adapted Screenplay are just further evidence of the positive recognition which this movie justifiably received.".

	schema:reviewBody " SPOILERS THROUGHOUT  This is a very strange film  particularly for its time  in every respect. For six years American movies had shown American soldiers as everybody's son brother father.In movies like The Best Years of Our Lives and Til the End of Time our hearts are tugged by the difficulty that the sweet returning soldiers have in adjusting to peace and their families. Yet in this same year this film shows soldiers as a mix of people rather worse than the viewer  one message of this film is  lock up your daughters. Even the good soldiers  with plenty of time on their hands  are gambling all the time getting stupefyingly drunk and are wholly indifferent to whether they even have wives any more. And their reaction to the police investigating a murder is  to conspire against them.Mitchum the most sympathetic soldier says things like I don't know if my wife wants to make a go of it now after the War. Haven't seen her in two years. Do I care? Not really. Maybe we'll make a go of it maybe not. Another soldier is shown as unusually sensitive because after years away he would like to see his wife again.Later when this soldier states at the police station that he spent the evening at a whore's home  without knowing his wife is sitting just behind him there seems to be no question whatever that his wife will be fine. Indeed she is  I guess it's Hey soldiers will be soldiers.The police detective played by Robert Young who is trying to crack a murder case states convincingly and with infinite weariness about someone's account of their actions on the night in question Do I care? No. I don't really care about anything any more. I've done this too long I guess. A man shows up at the whore's apartment. He says I'm just a man like you interested in the whore. Then he says No that's a lie I'm her husband. I'd like to be in the military I was turned down before. Then he says No that's a lie why would I want to be a soldier? He goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is. To the end of the movie we haven't a clue who he is or why he is there!He's one of the strangest characters in the history of movies! A man stands with his girlfriend at a bar talking to four soldiers when a clumsy soldier knocks a drink onto his girlfriend. She leaves to change her dress  and is right back wearing another no problem. Yet the man doesn't leave with his girlfriend  who simply disappears  but instead follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of the bar! The man then extrapolates from the minimal information he's learned about the soldier  to philosophize grandly about the problems of returning soldiers  and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick. This is strange stuff.Similarly a dance hall girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who would like to take her out for a real dance  and dinner maybe. Yet she does dance with him  and immediately gives him the key to her home! Were people in the late 1940s always urging soldiers to come to their homes after they just met them? Robert Ryan kills his host a stranger when he's enraged that the Jewish host tries to get the steadily drunker Ryan out of his home. The reason for the murder? No Jew tells me how to drink. How to drink? Huh? What does that mean? This movie is always offkilter quite deliberately so  the soldiers act consistently with total complete defiance of the law and all the characters are as cold and tough as any movie I've ever seen.And yet the movie is utterly gripping! You simply have no idea how these people are going to act  or what new bizarre character is going to pop up  without anyone thinking the person's actions are strange in the least  e.g. the wife's behavior.The acting is about the finest I'e ever seen  from Robert Young Robert Ryan Gloria Grahame who earned an Oscar nomination Paul Kelly and other actors I'd never heard of.I'd never heard of this movie  and it's a complete delight that I've discovered one that I shall want to see again and again and again. it's really strange but impossible to look away from because you've no idea what these creatures will do next.".

This is strange stuff.Similarly a dance hall girl is irritated by the sentimental soldier who would like to take her out for a real dance  and dinner maybe. Yet she does dance with him  and immediately gives him the key to her home! Were people in the late 1940s always urging soldiers to come to their homes after they just met them? Robert Ryan kills his host a stranger when he's enraged that the Jewish host tries to get the steadily drunker Ryan out of his home. The reason for the murder? No Jew tells me how to drink. How to drink? Huh? What does that mean? This movie is always offkilter quite deliberately so  the soldiers act consistently with total complete defiance of the law and all the characters are as cold and tough as any movie I've ever seen.And yet the movie is utterly gripping! You simply have no idea how these people are going to act  or what new bizarre character is going to pop up  without anyone thinking the person's actions are strange in the least  e.g. the wife's behavior.The acting is about the finest I'e ever seen  from Robert Young Robert Ryan Gloria Grahame who earned an Oscar nomination Paul Kelly and other actors I'd never heard of.I'd never heard of this movie  and it's a complete delight that I've discovered one that I shall want to see again and again and again. it's really strange but impossible to look away from because you've no idea what these creatures will do next.";

Only Sam Raimi the king of horror in my opinion has the power to bring a completely original horror movie back to the big screen in this day and age and capitalize with it. It was one of the most intense moviegoing experiences I've had in some time and I see it as a wild ride that no one should miss out on. It is guaranteed that you will be either jumping or cringing in your seat half the time unless you are one of those people lacking heavily in the department of sensitivity andor general thought processing. The movie is entertainment and horror fun in it's purest form. A lot of people complain about CGI and in a lot of cases I agree but in Drag Me To Hell they were never trying to hard with it  it was always in good fun and in a movie paced like this with it's SarcastiHorror it is certainly fitting.It is without question a new horror classic  thanks to it's basic yet innovative plot likable blondie loads of bodily fluids and an ending you will not forget.

	schema:reviewBody "Drag me to Hell is really a throwback in so many ways to the fun of The Evil Dead 2. The camera angles the excellent score  it all recalls how Raimi played with us in his earlier trilogy. What has changed however is the sense of pace. We know its coming and Raimi employs all his skills to draw out the tension. The thrills are all there in place I jumped like there was an electric buzzer under my seat. Perhaps a little too much CGI is indulged in but its easy to forgive in a film as wicked and blackly comic as this. I genuinely found the film disturbing for a 15 as well again I think this is a mark of tension that Raimi creates with the score and camera work throughout the film. So incredibly refreshing to see a horror film with out the hallmarks of the recent saw franchise. Special mention for the ending which has conviction and guts and was the proverbial cherry on top of the cake. throughly entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "After surrendering to the temptation that was Drag Me to Hell I jokingly announced to a friend that it was 13 horror 13 gross 13 funny and 100 fun! Yet as wholly cheesy as that proclamation is it is no less true. Ultimate B movie director Sami Rami's first horror film in years having dedicated himself to the Spiderman franchise succeeds in putting almost all recent horror films to shame. Drag Me to Hell proves that an R rating is not needed for shock scares nor does a PG13 rating mean that the film must feel stunted and incomplete only that it takes a dedicated and competent director to pull all the elements together.I recently called 2009 theyearofthealmostgoodhorrormovie with films like Friday the 13th The Haunting in Connecticut My Bloody Valentine The Last House on the Left et al simply not measuring up. While I am still hesitant to drop that moniker the thrills Drag me to Hell brings to the horror genre certainly improves the spread. Aside from the tantalizing premise itself Rami masterfully constructs atmosphere and amazes even further with a rousing and terrifying score and an absolutely chilling use of sound. Many tense sequences drift between an eerie quiet and a cacophony of anguish born from everyday objects and occurrences such as pots the wind and garden gates and this is the very best part of the film even if some other elements don't measure up as aptly.As a alluded to aside from Rami's fan base the real reason you would be drawn to this film is the premise and hell dragging there is. The unsuspecting victim is a young loan officer named Christine Brown Allison Lohman who in order to secure a spot in the managers chair denies an elderly lady a third extension on her mortgage. But her timing could not be worse as the gypsy mystic curses her to burn in hell for her shameful display. Christine now has only three days to rid herself of the terrible curse garnering the aid of a psychic Rham Jas Dileep Rao and her boyfriend Justin Long while trying to ward off the tormenting demon on her remaining days. Lohman is very good in this creating a character of equal parts spunk and sweetness. Long seems tailor made for a Rami film as his ability to drift between comedy and drama is a huge asset and is excellent as a result.The only real determent I found in this film was the ending which I will not spoil. It was actually a rather odd feeling that came over me when the credits rolled as usually a subpar ending leaves me either infuriated or disgusted. Drag me to Hell's ending left me feeling mostly indifferent and numb to the events of the entire film by which it was preceded. Many will disagree with me and I am glad as I thoroughly enjoyed the film and wish the ending had satisfied me accordingly. But the good certainly outweighs and bad and this schlocky gross and funny horror flick is very rewatchable and above all unique. If Rami can still turn out quality B movie thrills after all these years perhaps there is hope for liberation from the true hell which is the Hollywood horror scene of today.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

Raimi has always stated he wants his horror flicks to be nonstop fun and that's exactly what this is. It's a pretty stream of consciousness sort of thing the feeble plot about Alison Big Fish Lohman getting cursed is just an excuse to come up with as much demented stuff as humanly possible. Put some maggots in a pie and then somehow make it bleed why not huh? Anything goes here that keeps things interesting throughout. You never know what's going to happen next which is pretty damn scary. It's also a plus that eventually the movie works up to one of the the greatest climactic scenes I've ever seen in a horror movie now that's what I call a finale.

If she is so focused on herself to kill her cat when she's stating she's a humanitarian then she should have no trouble passing along the button to some miserable slime.

	schema:headline " Sam Raimi's Return to True Horror is a Triumph";
	schema:reviewBody "From the intense opening scene to the stellar and shocking finale Sam Raimi has officially returned to the horror genre with vigor and spark in the year's best horror film so far. Starring Alison Lohman in the leading role Ellen Page was originally cast as the lead but dropped out of the project early in production Drag Me to Hell feels like much more than your average predictable horror popcorn flick. It's filled with plenty of twists and turns and like any good ride a satisfying conclusion. And the PG13 rating? Forget about it! You hardly notice that little factor because of how immersed you become in the story. Also starring are Justin Long David Paymer and Lorna Raver.Christine Lohman a loan officer at a bank with a lovely boyfriend Long is being considered for a promotion. Jumping at the opportunity she comes across an old gypsy woman Raver who requests a third extension on her house. Her boss Paymer tells her it's a tough decision and its her call so she refuses the woman's payment. Absolutely infuriated the woman stalks Christine after work and bestows her with a supernatural curse one which she has only three days to overcome before the spirits drag her to hell.Lucky enough to have won tickets to a prescreening of the film I had heard nothing but great things about it. I was hoping for the best but I wasn't sure how the comedy and horror would mix together. Much to my surprise the horror and comedy in Drag Me to Hell are that rare perfect mix of perfection that one craves in horror movies. If too funny they can go overboard but not this one. In fact I don't think I've seen quite a proper mixture since Raimi's own Evil Dead II.Perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie is how well it's made technically. It had all sorts of interesting shots and the real work of a master filmmaker. Having both written and directed the film Sam Raimi more than proves his worth to the horror genre despite his long absence since Army of Darkness. In ways this is also a sort of revival of what people with think of PG13 horror movies. Drag Me to Hell is one of the most intense scary horror films in quite some time despite the PG13 rating which many tag as already crap.Drag Me to Hell is full of its epic shocks and the less you go in knowing about it the better. I could go on for hours about the movie and spoil everything there is to know but that would truly ruin some of its appeal. Which is certainly not to say that it is lost after a first viewing just that it's an experience unlike any other going into this movie watching virtually no clips and reading very little about it. It becomes a truly rewarding experience.Mrs. Ganush is one truly phenomenal villain that provides plenty of scares. Lorna Raver infuses the role with an enthusiasm  an terror  that is rarely seen in bigscreen baddies. She has more personality than The Ring's Samara for sure. Clay's character provides a muchneeded balance between the goofy and the horrific and helps make the film's heroine Christine all the more believable. It was an interesting twist to see Justin Long in a horror film despite the nature of his role. I believed his performance and the sincerity of his character. Lohman had a lot resting on her shoulders with this movie and she totally pulled it off with flying colors. Nobody plays the terrified but headstrong and determined female lead better than Lohman and she proves her worth over and over again in this movie. She totally has a career ahead of her.Overall Drag Me to Hell did more than just impress me nonstop. It was a masterpiece of a horror movie with unrivaled intensity scares and one killer of an ending. More often now horror directorswriters seem to have such a difficult time ending their movies properly. This one has an ending which snugly solidifies the movie as an early contender for best horror film of the year. Don't miss Drag Me to Hell... you will never look at handkerchiefs the same way!".

Drag Me to Hell is one of the most intense scary horror films in quite some time despite the PG13 rating which many tag as already crap.Drag Me to Hell is full of its epic shocks and the less you go in knowing about it the better. I could go on for hours about the movie and spoil everything there is to know but that would truly ruin some of its appeal. Which is certainly not to say that it is lost after a first viewing just that it's an experience unlike any other going into this movie watching virtually no clips and reading very little about it. It becomes a truly rewarding experience.Mrs. Ganush is one truly phenomenal villain that provides plenty of scares. Lorna Raver infuses the role with an enthusiasm  an terror  that is rarely seen in bigscreen baddies. She has more personality than The Ring's Samara for sure. Clay's character provides a muchneeded balance between the goofy and the horrific and helps make the film's heroine Christine all the more believable. It was an interesting twist to see Justin Long in a horror film despite the nature of his role. I believed his performance and the sincerity of his character. Lohman had a lot resting on her shoulders with this movie and she totally pulled it off with flying colors. Nobody plays the terrified but headstrong and determined female lead better than Lohman and she proves her worth over and over again in this movie. She totally has a career ahead of her.Overall Drag Me to Hell did more than just impress me nonstop. It was a masterpiece of a horror movie with unrivaled intensity scares and one killer of an ending. More often now horror directorswriters seem to have such a difficult time ending their movies properly. This one has an ending which snugly solidifies the movie as an early contender for best horror film of the year. Don't miss Drag Me to Hell... you will never look at handkerchiefs the same way!";

	schema:reviewBody "Drag Me to Hell might be the victim of unfair expectations or just plain incorrect assumptions. This might partially be down to the advertising campaign which could lead audiences to believing this is purely serious horror when in fact it is pulp silliness in the vein of the old EC comics and fully aware of it. Sam Raimi for whom the childhood experience of reading those pulp tales served as an inspiration for his nowlegendary Evil Dead movies and hence gave him his career has made his most fun and entertaining film since Army of Darkness and probably his best since then as well although I do need to see A Simple Plan again in Drag Me to Hell which feels like it could be an adaptation of one of those horror tales.Hopefully audiences will be expecting something along the lines of Evil Dead mixed with its sequels when they go in or they could leave disappointed. Unless you're scared by old women and supernatural mumbo jumbo unless you're a superstitious person Drag Me to Hell probably won't be giving you any nightmares. Then again I'm not scared by anything really. Still one can't help but feel that this sort of thing if done seriously doesn't belong in today's age of rationality and would work only in the 50's or maybe even then would be too late to really pack a punch.That's why this is like the Evil Dead movies a cartoon. It is one cartoony horror setpiece after the other more often than not with an overt comedic edge and always always with its tongue firmly in cheek. The characters are wellrealized enough for the movie to be endurable and wellplayed too Justin Long is perfect for the role regardless of how limited his range is and I can't imagine anyone but Lohman playing this particular role but Raimi doesn't really care about them. He cares more about piling on the pulp grossouts resorting here to all sorts of unsavory things including embalming fluid gushing out of a corpse into Lohman's mouth one of a multitude of things Raimi takes pleasure in introducing to that particular orifice of Lohman's body but not much blood at all. It isn't needed either the PG13 rating may sound like a limitation but it's hard to imagine this movie with much more gore although there are a few things that happen offscreen that I would have LOVED to see onscreen but that might be because I'm a horribly sick person.Utilizing an active expressive camera akin to the sort of thing we saw in the Evil Dead movies Raimi stages these ridiculous scenes with gusto and passion. This is not going to terrify many people but it is absolutely terrific at being what it sets out to be a live action EC comic. As long as you go in expecting that you'll probably leave satisfied. I'd like to leave you with the wise words of AV Club critic Scott Tobias He wants viewers to jump out of their chairs to laugh and scream and cheer and to nudge each other over the transcendent ridiculousness of what they're witnessing. This is junk filmmaking at its finest.".

	schema:headline " Predictable";
	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I HAVE to give this film a 110 to get the ratings down. I just got back from the cinema after watching this crap and I expected the IMDb rating to be 5 or lower. Imagine my surprise when it has 810!This film is all too predictable. Think of Stephen King's Thinner meets The Haunting In Connecticut.I walk into the cinema and there is NO ONE else there. The film starts with some Mexican boy being possessed and I thought the film was going to be one of those spoof horrorcomedies when I saw overthetop creepy shadow hands crawling over the ceiling. He gets dragged off to hell because he was cursed by a gypsy whose necklace he stole. Some Mexican woman looks on and promises to get revenge on the spirit that did it. When that scene finished we're taken to the life of Christine Brown a loan officer for Wilshire Pacific Bank. She's after a promotion to position of Assistant Manager but so is her rival  the Asian Company Agent from Prison Break season 2.She's day dreaming when some old gypsy woman starts asking her if the bank could give her more time on a mortgage repayment she missed. Christine wanting to impress the boss says no and so the gypsy then begs her lunges at her and is then dragged out kicking and screaming. To be honest I thought that was simply horrible and I thought immediately that she deserved what happens but then we cut to a spooky underground car park a setting used far too much for suspense and cheap scares where the gypsy is waiting in Christine's car. Now here is the only time in the film where I WAS surprised. I thought the gypsy would curse her like in Thinner but instead starts attacking her with great strength and agility and it was quite funny to watch. One bit that was funny was when the gypsy's false teeth smash and she tries biting Christine with gums. Anyway the whole fight seemed pointless as all she did was take a button from Christine's coat curse it and give it back and THEN the predictability starts.Christine and her boyfriend drive home where she starts getting creeped out with noises and seeing scary things with sharp teeth. Before she goes home she sees an Indian fortune teller who just happens to know EVERYTHING about the curse and was luckily just next to her boyfriend's parked car. He says she's cursed and makes no attempt to help her. After a half hour of miscellaneous scares and going to see the gypsy to retract the curse again just like in Thinner I KNEW the old bag would be dead she sees Indian man again. He says make a sacrifice so she kills her pet cat instead of finding a stray and I KNEW it wouldn't work. Meanwhile at work she has a nose bleed so intense that she sprays blood everywhere and no one phones a doctor or anything. They just do nothing while she runs away. So back she goes to Indian man who says he knows this woman and you know what's coming a standard Hollywood scary exorcism scene done by the Mexican woman from the first scene in the film what a coincidence.Here we're told that to remove the demon Indian man Christine Mexican woman and another Mexican man have to hold hands summon the demon and transfer it to a goat. Kill the goat and it's over. The goat starts to talk when it's possessed but of course the plan doesn't go ahead properly and the Mexican man gets bitten and is possessed. Mexican woman chants and the spirit is gone but Mexican woman dies for no reason. Indian man puts the cursed button in an envelope and says to give it to someone else and THEY will be dragged off to hell instead. She lies to her boyfriend saying it's all over and drops the envelope in the car and picks it up again. She ponders giving it to the Asian man from Prison Break but can't so back to Indian man again who says to give it to the gypsy's corpse. So over she goes to the cemetery digs up the corpse and puts it in her mouth.Next scene she's all happy and I KNEW it wasn't a happy end. When she dropped the envelope in the car she mixed it with another envelope with a coin in it so she never got rid of it. She's dragged to hell while boyfriend watches and cries and it's over. Predictable standard horror.If gypsies can curse people so easily they should be ruling the world. Why didn't she use those powers to make payments or whatever? It makes no sense. Why this has such a high rating I don't know. It relies on shock scares too much with the plot being too ridiculous. The Indian man was ridiculous. Why didn't he just say give the button back to the gypsy or take her to the exorcist in the first place?".

He says make a sacrifice so she kills her pet cat instead of finding a stray and I KNEW it wouldn't work. Meanwhile at work she has a nose bleed so intense that she sprays blood everywhere and no one phones a doctor or anything. They just do nothing while she runs away. So back she goes to Indian man who says he knows this woman and you know what's coming a standard Hollywood scary exorcism scene done by the Mexican woman from the first scene in the film what a coincidence.Here we're told that to remove the demon Indian man Christine Mexican woman and another Mexican man have to hold hands summon the demon and transfer it to a goat. Kill the goat and it's over. The goat starts to talk when it's possessed but of course the plan doesn't go ahead properly and the Mexican man gets bitten and is possessed. Mexican woman chants and the spirit is gone but Mexican woman dies for no reason. Indian man puts the cursed button in an envelope and says to give it to someone else and THEY will be dragged off to hell instead. She lies to her boyfriend saying it's all over and drops the envelope in the car and picks it up again. She ponders giving it to the Asian man from Prison Break but can't so back to Indian man again who says to give it to the gypsy's corpse. So over she goes to the cemetery digs up the corpse and puts it in her mouth.Next scene she's all happy and I KNEW it wasn't a happy end. When she dropped the envelope in the car she mixed it with another envelope with a coin in it so she never got rid of it. She's dragged to hell while boyfriend watches and cries and it's over. Predictable standard horror.If gypsies can curse people so easily they should be ruling the world. Why didn't she use those powers to make payments or whatever? It makes no sense. Why this has such a high rating I don't know. It relies on shock scares too much with the plot being too ridiculous. The Indian man was ridiculous. Why didn't he just say give the button back to the gypsy or take her to the exorcist in the first place?";

In all fairness I loved those movies as a kid when my dad showed me them on VHS. They were scary and weird so it was still enjoyable despite the oddness.Drag me to Hell on the other hand well I seriously considered leaving the theater. If you want to simply jump throughout the movie you're in luck it uses about 20 or so clich suspense moments to get you scared. Now I've watched plenty of horror movies in my day so disliking the movie had nothing to do with disliking gross things but the amount of goo in this movie was just unnecessary and only there for the sake of being gross. While I now understand the comicalhorror scenes in this movie As I'm now aware of the creator for newcomers to the maker or just casual moviegoers in general it doesn't make sense to be in there. If we come for a scary movie we don't expect to see LooneyTune situations. Laughter amidst a horror movie may be a nice break and all but it just makes the movie look silly low budget badly written and not serious considering the rest of the movies mood.The acting for this was mixed it was either over the top and unneeded or just awkward. Later we meet the Boyfriend's parents who are clearly wealthy. While they went for a smug rich people act it just seemed like acting of a cheap television show.Personally I found the music and sounds to be terrible in this movie I apologize if this is coming off as a rant but I'll explain. Drag me to Hell is LOUD extremely so in the suspense scenes people were covering their ears due to the loud pitch. Musically it was just inappropriate during one particular horror scene they chose a Jazzlike bass rift. CGI in the movie was decent nothing awardwinning but it worked despite certain scenes looking as if they were from the 1987 Evil Dead film. The style mirrored that of My Bloody Valentine where everything appeared ready for 3D assuming you didn't see that in 3DOn paper the plot is good. Or at least it started good though realistically its just your typical Somethings going to possess you and haunt you we need to do an old ritual to end it film See also The Eye The Unborn Etc.To sum things up I wasted my time and money by seeing this movie. While I would like to appreciate it as the Comeback of a great horror director I just refuse to call it anything more than a cult hit. Don't see this movie its a jumbled mess of random acts thrown together to create suspense just for the sake of doing so.".

	schema:reviewBody "To properly and fairly access my experience with seeing Drag Me To Hell Sam Raimi's The Gift Spider Man much anticipated and blogged about new opus we must first take a little trip back in time to the year 1995. As a kid I had always been intrigued by the horror genre most of which likely spawned from my parent's extreme hatred towards it. While they perused the Comedy and Drama sections of our old video store then stocked to the brim with VHS tapes I might add I found myself sneaking off to the far left corner among the gory trashy at often times downright pornographic cover art that adorned the paper sleeves for films such as Invasion of the Blood Farmers and Deadtime Stories. Like a college freshman introduced to mass quantities of alcohol for the first time with no guidance in sight I was on overload. What were they attempting to keep me from? If I slid this threw the door of my old Sony T120 what exactly would I be getting myself into? One would like to think I found the answer that day instead of being forced to watch The Jerk for the ten thousandth time but alas my first experience with the terror genre began that same year late at night in the comforts of my own bed with a remote control a freshly fluffed pillow and the SciFi Channel. The words flashed onto the screen The Evil Dead in blood red bold faced lettering. As I watch the plot unfold I found myself paralyzed by the images I was seeing. Humans being possessed by demons dismembered by their own friends maniacally laughing in a distorted demented all together frightening way and above all jumping out at me when I least expected it. I was changed. My outlook on movies changed. My fear of the dark was created and that was WITH commercial breaks. Of course I have only one man to thank for getting me hooked on the Terror genre and that is Sam Raimi.After almost twenty years since Army of Darkness the final installment of the Evil Dead franchise Mr. Raimi returns to his old stomping grounds with Drag Me to Hell the tale of Christine Allison Lohman Matchstick Men a loan officer whom forces Mrs. Ganush a sick decrepit gypsy woman from her home by denying her an extension on an already delinquent bank loan. As fate would have it after work in a desolate parking garage Christine is attacked and the curse of the Lamia is placed onto her. In the days to follow she is brutally attacked by unseen entities experiences visions of a deformed Mrs. Ganush and attempts to reverse the curse by contacting psychic mediums. Time is of the essence but taking the curse off proves to be much more difficult than it was to put on as we witness Christine attempt to silence it before she is dragged to hell.Earlier on I referred to my obsession with the Terror genre. Terror differs from Horror in that its goal is to completely terrify the audience as opposed to simply scaring them. Drag Me to Hell falls into one such category. From start to finish you make the first plunge down the drop of a 100 minute roller coaster and in the end feel as if you've been tossed around and abused by a master manipulator Raimi. It is evident through the use and placement of scares gore mixture of comedy and horror as well as pacing of the plot that Raimi didn't have to do much dusting off to get back in the game. He clearly knows that in this genre simplicity is often times the best course of action. The storyline and its unraveling is basic often times boarding on naivety but the absolute madness that ensues within its walls is comparable to a warm piece of chocolate cake. Allison Lohman who replaced Ellen Page in early stages of development does a fine job of portraying Christine and the character arc that she goes through. Page would have brought a bit more grittiness to the role but that's beside the point. Lohman is able to bring the charm and diversity to the part. Justin Long as Clay Christines boyfriend delivers as always and manages to keep it real in a role that could have very easily turned corny had it not been handled correctly. Supporting cast Mrs. Ganush Lorna Raver and Rham Jas Dileep Rao the Medium are both convincing in their extremely demanding parts. What's so special about Drag Me to Hell is that it knows its roots. It takes us back to the days when it was a true experience to see a horrorterror movie. When you went into a movie theater and the audience jumped yelled at the screen and quivered in shock and disgust. At the conclusion it brought them to their feet with a standing ovation and all along with the mindset of Okay we're all in this together let's make it out in one piece. Drag Me to Hell is what a good experience at the movies is all about. There will be those who hate it loath it even but for the handful of us that were transformed into obsessed fans of this niche market by a master director it will validate our love for the genre and will forever stand as a true testament of the best it has to offer. As for myself for a short moment in time I was a thirteen again curled up under my covers frozen with fear and loving every single minute of it.".

I have always been a big Sam Raimi fan....I watched Evil Dead 12 and Army of Darkness religiously in High School....so to be able to work on Raimi's return to horror was an honor and a pleasure. And this does not disappoint. It was exactly what I would have expected from a master of comedic horror that got to really cut his teeth on the mega budget Spiderman series. Extremely refined...but not a product. It doesn't feel like a typical Hollywood film....yet has the production values of one.I was extremely excited when I got my invitation to attend the premiere and I was not at all disappointed. The final film is both one of the creepiest and scariest film I've seen in a while and yet in perfect Raimi brothers style....very funny even at times most other film makers wouldn't have been able to make it funny.I'm not going to spoil anything but for those of you that saw the PG13 rating and groaned let me say....don't let it deter you. As with other great Raimi films the scare is in what is NOT seen....which is what makes it so damn scary! I wish more horror filmmakers would finally realize that. There are some extremely tense moments brought on by nothing but great camera work and awesome sound design.If you want a genuinely creepy movie....and a great laugh go check it out when it comes out. You will NOT be disappointed.Oh and none of my shots were cut!!! Woohoo!".

Judy Garland had appeared as a supporting player in several Rooney films and the two had significant chemistrymore over Garland had just completed photography for THE WIZARD OF OZa film that MGM rightly expected would launch her to international stardom. The time was right to costar the two and MGM did it with BABES IN ARMS. The film was an immediate hit one of the most admired musicals of the year. But time has a way of changing our perspective. Seen today BABES IN ARMS feels a little strange a little strained and at times just downright well ODD.BABES IN ARMS was originally a Rogers and Hart show that proved a smash on the New York stagea slightly satirical script with one of the most powerful scores of the 1930s. MGM specifically purchased the property for Rooney and Garland and then promptly threw out the script most of the score and transformed the thing into the tale of young teenagers who decide to put on a show in a barn.Although well performed the songs that replaced the original score simply do not measure up to the play's original score and viewers are likely to be startled by a minstrel show number that finds Mickey and Judy romping in blackface. In justice to the film it should be remembered that while minstrel shows remained popular well into the 1950s and such great stars as Al Jolson and Eddie Cantor performed in full blackface well into the 1930s. While the number is stereotypical it is not meanspirited and if nothing else it offers a glimpse into a now dead theatrical tradition.But weirdest of all is the grand finale In God's Country a strange mixture of Hollywood ballyhoo patriotism and fear of the European war that would soon engulf the world. In its original form the number also included Rooney and Garland doing a take off of FDR and Eleanor although cleverly performed and quite mild in content this was later cut in rerelease for MGM worried it might be construed as disrespectful during wartime.The film has a number of distinct flaws. Director Busby Berkley was most at home with bigbudget musicals that had scope for the elaborate dance numbers he favoredhe's something of a fish out of water with this more intimate material and his approach feels heavy handed. Although much admired at the time he actually received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for this film Mickey Rooney's performance is absurdly manic by modern standards and Garland's more natural performance is too often overshadowed by his excesses. The script is as weak as the score few of the supporting performers are memorable Margaret Hamilton is an exception and the whole thing has a awkward quality to it.Even so it's still possible to see what all the fuss was about. The film does capture an inkling of the famous RooneyGarland chemistrya chemistry that would fuel three more let's put on a show! musicals each one more more effective than the last. It is there in every musical number the two perform in every line in every scene a very real and very powerful thing. While casual viewers would do better to select either BABES ON Broadway or GIRL CRAZY in spite of all its flaws RooneyGarland fans will likely find BABES IN ARMS an essential.Gary F.

	schema:headline " Bought An Idea";
	schema:reviewBody "For Mickey and Judy fans Babes in Arms is an absolute must. It's the only one of their films in which one of the two got an Oscar nomination. Mickey Rooney was nominated for Best Actor personally I think as an afterthought because his competition was Clark Gable for Gone With the Wind Laurence Olivier for Wuthering Heights James Stewart for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and the winner Robert Donat for Goodbue Mr. Chips. Not that Mickey's bad but he really didn't belong with this field.What he and Judy do they do better than anyone else put on a show. In fact in this case the 'put on a show' gambit did originate in the original Broadway Musical. Babes in Arms was one of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's best shows it ran for 289 performances in the 1937 season and boasted such RodgersHart classics as Johnny One Note Way Out West My Funny Valentine I Wish I Were in Love Again all of which were discarded for the film. The Lady is a Tramp is only heard instrumentally my guess is the Code frowned on that lyric. The title song and Where or When are retained. In fact when you come right down to it only the basic idea the songs mentioned and a couple characters names came over from Broadway.Still Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed wrote Good Morning which is better known from Singin' in the Rain but it was Judy and Mickey who introduced it here. And a whole lot of other BrownFreed songs from MGM musicals got interpolated into the score.Douglas MacPhail and Betty Jaynes who were introduced in Sweethearts also are here and sing beautifully. They married but the marriage and MacPhail's career fell apart and he committed suicide a few years later. He had a great baritone voice what a shame. The following year he introduced my favorite Cole Porter song I Concentrate On You in The Broadway Melody of 1940. This was the film Judy Garland did right after The Wizard of Oz and coming along right with her is Margaret Hamilton playing another Miss Gulch like character. One of those spinster ladies who forever pry into other people's business.Believe it or not there was still a lot of prejudice against theatrical people even in 1937. A lot of old vaudeville types like Charles Winninger Rooney's father in the film settle in the town of Seaport on Long Island and their presence apparently upsets the ruling families like Hamilton's. When times go bad and vaudeville goes to seed things get kind of rough for them. The old timers try to take a last tour to raise some money but instead it's the kids who are up to the latest trends in pop music who save the day.Guy Kibbee is in this also playing against type as a wise and sympathetic judge usually the parts MGM reserved for Lewis Stone or Lionel Barrymore. A more typical Kibbee type would be the oafish tycoon in 42nd Street but he's fine here.Possibly director Busby Berkeley wanted Kibbee maybe as a good luck charm from that other breakthrough musical of his from his days at Warner Brothers. Of course the musical numbers in the show are set with the usual Berkeley surrealism a little tempered though from his high flying days at Warner Brothers. That same year Berkeley had done a surreal type number in the Jeanette MacDonaldLew Ayres film Broadway Serenade and it laid an egg. Someone at MGM must have reined him in.Babes In Arms retains all its charms from 1939 mainly because Mickey Rooney is infectious and Judy Garland's singing is eternal.".

Their first such movie I think and probably their most famous. Mickey  Judy are great. Mickey does Lionel Barrymore and Clark Gable impressions that are a hoot. He also has a fight scene in a drug store which is amusing. The supporting cast is made up of fine character actors like Guy Kibbee Charles Winninger and Henry Hull. Adorable June Preisser steals every scene she's in. Margaret Hamilton plays the villain a busybody who tries to get the kids taken away from their parents. Garland  Hamilton filmed this right after Wizard of Oz by the way. Interestingly this was actually a bigger hit at the box office than Oz was in 1939.Most of the songs are nice but none wowed me. Several classic Rodgers  Hart tunes from the Broadway musical this was based on are either omitted altogether or featured too briefly to make an impact. An earsplitting operatic version of You're My Lucky Star by Betty Jaynes is probably the worst song in the movie. Judy's I Cried for You is best. Salute to minstrel shows with cast members in blackface will upset some so prepare yourself if you're one of them. Directed by Busby Berkeley as evidenced by his distinct touches on the God's Country closing number. Speaking of which that number has Mickey  Judy satirizing FDR  Eleanor. After FDR's death this part was cut out of future showings and it remained that way until the '90s. It's a lively number and the added historical value is a plus. Good oldfashioned fun. Charming innocent and yes a little corny but an enjoyable movie overall.".

Judy Garland's portrayal of a girl in love but shunned is reminiscent of almost all of the MGM musical roles in which she partook during her stint that lasted into the late 1940s. The minstrel act is a particularly interesting look at the virulent racism that still plagued American cinema during the Studio AgeJudy Garland in blackface is perhaps one of the most frightening images I have ever encountered.Though one cannot approach a film like this with more than a hint of cynicism Busby Berkeley is arguably the greatest choreographer in the history of film and though he does not show off the spectacle of his earlier films like Gold Diggers of 1933 and Gold Diggers of 1935 which he did not direct his dance numbers are interesting for instance when the town's teenagers partake in a bookburning throwing into the flames symbols of conformity. The film is sweet fresh and bright and as the first Arthur Freed musical serves as one of his better though certainly not his best. In all I give it a 3 out of 4 stars . On a side note three of the songs that appear in Singing in the Rain appear in this film predating the Gene Kelly musical by over 15 years Good Morning Good Morning Singing in the Rain which appears in a montage showing previous MGM musicals and You Are My Lucky Star.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow I just finished watching Babes in Arms and my head is spinning. We old movie fans are used to seeing ethnic humor and even the occasional bit of blackface in early Hollywood films but what Babes in Arms gives us is outrageous by any definition an entire cast of a show within a show numbering at least 50 to 75 people including Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland every one in blackface performing not just a minstrel skit nor a single musical number but an entire 20 minute fullblown minstrel show in spectacular MGM fullproduction mode. It goes on and on and on. Dialect jokes. Banjoes and songs about Alabammy. And finally Judy Garland having removed her blackface comes out and performs an additional number I'm Just Wild About Harry as an only slightly darkened black woman. Wow.On the other hand is it really possible that the manic Mickey Rooney was only 19 when he made this? He really shows why he may be the single most talented American performer of the last century. He dances he sings he does drama he does comedy and he has incredible control over his every move and muscle. And he does unbelievable and hilarious impressions of Clark Gable and Lionel Barrymore. And Franklin Roosevelt.A few quick notes June Priesser who plays Baby Rosalie was a terrible actress. But watch out for her stomachchurning contortionist backrolls when she first comes out on a stage.The child actor who plays Mickey Rooney at age 5 dancing on a Vaudeville stage for a few moments early on really does look like Mickey Rooney! I think Judy Garland actually has some of the same lines in this movie as she does in Wizard of Oz done in this same year. Watch out for when Mickey Rooney feints early in the film Garland reacts to this exactly and I mean exactly as she does in Oz when the Lion feints. Eerie! When Judy Garland as Eleanor Roosevelt sings My day my day she is referring to an actual longrunning newspaper column written by E.R. from 1936 to 1962.Finally the final song and dance number is the most mindnumbing overthetop tribute to America dancing how we are not Nazis American Indians Asian Indians dancing the Roosevelts and dancing that I have ever seen. Yes it was early WWII but still you wonder if anyone even in 1939 thought this was a little too much? Recommended for its high energy its Rooney and Garland its more Rooney its offensiveness and its too much of everything. It is history and should be watched by all.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw it on TCM after finally acquiring cable. It's sweet. I imagine the original stage score was sharper and more adult but you must know by now that Hollywood has been tampering with the scores of stage musicals since the year 1. When they filmed GAY DIVORCE they eliminated the entire score save one little song danced by Fred Astaire. There's been stagetoscreen tampering done with SHOW BOAT ON THE TOWN BRIGADOON SWEET CHARITY and A CHORUS LINE to name a few. And Rodgers  Hart were decidedly more sophisticated adult composers they had to endure the wrath of the puritanical Hollywood image back then. This is why I've always preferred musicals originally created for the screen no one looking for a stage predecessor would be offended. As it is they did keep The Lady is A Tramp in the background and allowed Where or When to be performed as a slightly botched band rehearsal. But I love the staging of the title song a march through the street gathering more and more teens as they go with its bonfirerally finale and Judy Garland's torch solo I Cried For You is a stunning piece of poignancy which makes you forget that she is only 17 years old. She does a magnificent job of grounding the overly ecstatic Mickey Rooney. As for dated film accusations yes it is dated America just entered World War II at this movie's release and it's probably no coincidence that the film's finale God's Country is an especially long uplifting musical sequence. I mean how ageless can it be with Mickey Rooney doing an impersonation of President Roosevelt?!".

Thus BB encourages the Mickster to go into his full Eugene O'Neill mode and he outshouts everyone in the movie including the hurricane! That is when he's not on the verge of tears. If a woman had so overheated you'd say it's her time of the month I can only guess Mick's ego went nuclear and BB wasn't interested enough to rein him in. He may not have even noticed. The most absurd stroke is that Rooney clearly believed he was a great impressionist too and BB let him do crude impersonations of Gable and Barrymore among others that seem pointless and self congratulatory. Judy is early Judy shy more Dorothy Gale than the windstorm of talent she'd become in later Freed masterpieces like Meet Me in St. Louis and so forth. Some other oddities or at least they seem odd now a big number in which Mick and the kids march through the streets of a Long Island coastal town carrying torches and proclaiming that they are the future has an odd Nazi vibe to it. Creepy. Then there's baritone Doug McPhail who was five years from suicide he's the next Nelson Eddy except there was no next Nelson Eddy which may be why he poisoned himself. Johhny Sheffield later to be Boy to Johnny Weismuller's Tarzan is briefly glimpsed and such MGM regs as Guy Kibbee and Margaret Hamilston are around to ground the movie in solid professionalism.

Yet what an interestingly talented field of teenage talent not to mention an interesting case study of youth rebellion pre Rebel Without a Cause period. It proves how easily Hollywood could provide ample entertainment in the Golden Era and with all its simplicity all the reasons in the world as to why Hollywood simply cannot do this today. Although the predominance of Mickey Rooney is obvious throughout over Judy he was nonetheless a delight to watch comic charming musical and repressed talents and all receiving a well deserved Oscar Nomination up against some of the biggest names of Hollywood in its greatest year. Judy with little mention required was once again brilliant in one of her earliest starring vehicles. The supporting cast seems to be in need of a desperate stretch in order to keep up with a gold mine of talent. Usage of expensive looking dresses amongst the backyard setting doesn't assist and neither do seventeen year old operatic divas. The older members of the cast however seem to be doing alright despite the fact their competition is superseding them in real life as well. Otherwise the rest of the supporting actors in unconvincing scenery settings seem to be able to only follow Busby Berkley's direction with certain lines on repeat. Music dominates within the Rodgers and Hart play although much of the original score disappeared leaving two songs contributed by the duo including the title song. The highlight of the program is Good Morning which is probably also remembered for being reused with different lyrical arrangements in the MGM musical masterpiece Singin' in the Rain. This and most of the other songs remains the high point of the musical.It is obvious that the intent of the movie is not plot. I can now pride myself on being successfully able to predict every occurrence ahead of time for the first time in my life a fact I am usually oblivious to even in the most screamingly awakening of circumstances. What puzzled me was the reason as to why they didn't attempt Broadway Melody of 1939. Or was there such a thing?However this continued to pave the way with gold for two of the best Hollywood stars. All in all this is a great pleasure to watch. And for an evening in it is great fun for the young at heart. Rating 810".

Now the best musical number is at the begging of the film and its the Good Morning number. What is great about this number is that is just Judy and Mickey. No fireworks or special effects. ITs two very talented people and a piano. Other numbers in this film range only from Barely Tolerable to Awful. Worth watching once. Funny thing is that this film made more money At The Time than The Wizard of Oz".

	schema:headline " Lots of fun drama songs and dancing with manic Mickey Judy June Betty and McPhail hamming it up.";
	schema:reviewBody "Judy made an amazing transformation in the latter part of '39 from Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz into Mickey Rooney's girlfriend in what amounts to a transformation of the Andy Hardy series into a musical drama the first of a series of 4 3 directed by Busby Berkeley who also directed the spectacular finale of the 4th. The general construct of the subsequent films was established in this film with a big production number toward the end of the first half and another representing the finale with lesser musical numbers in between. Actually in this film in contrast to the subsequent films we have two big production numbers toward the end. The first of these is the minstrel show which serves as a model for the amazingly similar in many ways longer minstrel show in Babes on Broadway. In both these shows Mickey plays the stock minstrel character Mr. Bones while Judy plays the stock character Mr. Tambo who engage in a bit of inane dialogue with the MC. In both films there is a brief soft shoe dance to a classic moonbased song Mickey dancing to Moonlight Bay here while Ray McDonald later danced to By the Light of the Silvery Moon. These served as breathers in these mostly manic productions. In both films Judy later ditches her blackface Mr. Tambo character to become a mulatto singerdancer. Here she sings I'm Just Wild About Harry with Mickey later joining in then the chorus taking over as they dance wildly. This production lacks the latter part of the long minstrel show in Babes on Broadway. It's like BB wanted to redo it with more of his typical features such as some overhead projection shots and more chorus line shenanigans. If you are sensitive to blackface productions especially involving stock minstrel characters please skip these parts of these films. I don't have a problem.The rousing antifascist patriotic finale features the USApraising song In God's Country which includes a variety of scenes and themes some inane sometimes with a big picture of the capitol in the background. In part Mickey plays FDR. Actually Judy is much better in imitating wife Eleanor during the fireside chat segment. Mickey's previous attempts to mimic other actors also fell rather flat except perhaps for Eddie Cantor's Ida. The first big production unlike the more traditional comparable productions in the subsequent films is the bizarre scene where the gang of thespian hopefuls march through the streets while singing carrying torches and gathering crates for a bonfire which they dance around while McPhail sings defiant verse from a podium. Yes it does have the look of a Nazi rally as some others have noted. But it's really a symbolic burning of old vaudeville traditions. This scene was instigated by their disappointment in Mickey's father rejecting Mickey's new style of musical compositions and screenplays he proposed that his father help sponsor.This film can also be thought of as a model for some of Universal's wartime musical comedies starring young Don O'Connor and Peggy Ryan who were Uiversal's version of Mickey and Judy. Most of their film series included an operastyled teenage female singer and occasionally a Nelson Eddytype singer who provided a sophisticated dimension to some of the music. We see the same thing here which is lacking in the subsequent Mickey  Judy musicals. Douglas MnPhail's booming operatic voice dominates a number of scenes most memorably the mob march and bonfire scene. He was a significant character in the screenplay as well. Betty Jaynes who plays Mickey's sister was his female counterpart and his offscreen wife at this time. They had one too brief and interrupted duet to the classic When or Where from the play Babes in Arms. Betty also did a bizarre very abbreviated comedic You Are My Lucky Star. This prior Brown and Freed song along with their new theme song Good Morning would again be featured in Singing in the Rain. Very tragically this singing duo would be doomed to brief film careers as '30sstyled operettas were about to go out of style. Nonetheless they certainly could have been used in other types of musicals or in straight dramatic roles. McPhail looked much like Clark Gable at his age and from what I saw could have succeeded in purely dramatic roles. Alas he soon became an alcoholic and succeeded in a second suicide attempt a few years later. Veteran vaudevillefilm actor Charles Winninger was the main character in the first portion of the film. savoring his life in the heyday of vaudeville and fathering a son who would become Mickey's character. With the advent of soundies vaudeville went into a step decline thus he advises Mickey and friends not to try to follow as a stage actor.June Preisser plays 'Baby'  the sexy blond daughter of a rich family whom Mickey has to play up to in order to hopefully obtain the financing for his show. His date with her in her mansion is rather comical. Naturally Judy becomes jealous and wants to run away. But Baby's father pulls her from the lead female role in the show giving Judy a chance to take her place....June would return to play a similar role in the next film in this series Strike Up the Band. She was noted for the gymnastic and contortionist aspects of her 'dancing'.".

	schema:headline " Early RooneyGarland musical";
	schema:reviewBody "Babes in Arms is the first of four musicals MGM made for its two young musical talents Mickey Rooney as Mickey Moran and Judy Garland as Patsy Barton. And this one is very entertaining. The story is OK  the kids are protgs of parents who had been successes in vaudeville. They now live in a community on Long Island where many performers also have settled down. The rest of the story plot will be familiar to movie buffs. The story was developed so that we could see Rooney Garland and several other good performers display their talents. The movie is adapted from a play by Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart. The kids shine in two Rogers Hart numbers  Babes in Arms and Where or When. Several other numbers are interspersed in the movie. The last two numbers are lengthy staged routines with singing dancing and dialog. Nacio Herb Brown  Arthur Freed wrote Good Morning and Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg wrote God's Country. In the latter two Rooney shows some excellent footwork and does a couple of nice imitations. Garland also does a nice imitation of Eleanor Roosevelt.One strange thing in this move was the bus that Patsy takes to visit her mother in Schenectady NY. I've ridden Greyhound and Trailways buses many years ago but I've never seen a bus with sleeping berths. This is the first and only one I've ever seen in a movie or anywhere. And this berth doesn't even look cramped like those in trains. I suspect this was just a concoction of MGM to give Garland a more comfy setting in which to film her song I've Cried for You.This early film of the series isn't up to the caliber of the later ones but it's enjoyable just the same. Most have more comedy dialog. One cute and funny scene here is in the opening. Mickey asks Patsy Would you like my pin? Patsy replies It's your music class pin. Mickey Well what do you want me to say? Patsy You know what I want you to say. Mickey Well I won't. Patsy All right then don't. Mickey Oh Pat . I do. Patsy You do what? Mickey I do what you want me to say and I won't. Very much.And remembering that this was 1939 the last song in the tune God's Country has some clever lines. We've got no Duce we've got no Fhrer but we've got Garbo and Norma Shearer. Got no goose steps but we got a Suzie Q step .. Here in God's country.".

Both also play young teenagers in this movie and it earned Mickey Rooney actually an Oscar nomination. There of course weren't a lot of musicals around at the time which purely had teenagers in it. In that regard this movie is a refreshing little entry in the musical genre.It's an enjoyable and obviously light movie. But this of course also has as a result that the movie doesn't really ever reaches the a level of true greatness. The movie is enjoyable but just nothing more than that. It's obviously rather formulaic and predictable but this doesn't take away the entertainment value of it all. The movie is dragging in some parts but then again which '30's movie doesn't do so in parts? The movie perhaps also doesn't end in the way as it should have had when some more sentimental themes start to kick in.In all fairness the movie features some good songs. I'm normally not particularly too fond of songs featured in most musical movies but this movie does form an exception. Nothing I would be singing along with but it's nice sounding and of course gets performed by some capable artist.I enjoyed watching this movie simply for what it was.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It's almost as nuts as the one Joan Crawford does in Torch Song except that the later movie is in Technicolor and gets to show off Crawford's hair. There's also the finale that has Mickey and Judy doing their impressions of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt respectively.Mickey also gets to do an impression of Lionel Barrymore not too successfully and Clark Gable absolutely hilarious. Mickey is determined and almost manic to the point I half expected him to exclaim As God is my witness I'll never go hungry again!

	schema:reviewBody "Ayn Rand called her style of writing Romantic Realism. As far as her film adaptation of her famous novel The Fountainhead is concerned BodiceRipper with Philosophical Pretensions would be a more accurate description.Despite an enormous budget an accomplished director and some of the best acting talent available in the late 40's this is one of the most unintentionally hilarious message pictures of all time.Besides the fact that Raymond Massey had major parts in both films though here it's in a supporting role as pallid WilliamRandolphHearstclone Gail Wynand there are quite a few similarities between this film and another famous flop 1937's Things To Come. Both screenplays were written by revered authors with a huge popular following. The films themselves are visually stunning paeans to high technology with fine casts and lavish production values all of which are completely subverted by the reams of astonishingly clunky dialog mouthed by their cardboardcutout characters.The main difference between the two is that H. G. Wells was near the end of his career as a writer while Rand was arguably at the peak of her narrative powers. At least with The Fountainhead you know what you're in for from the very beginning as veteran character actor Henry Hull  playing Howard Roark's alcoholic ontheskids mentor  doesn't merely chew the scenery but tears into it like a famished piranha before his character's merciful for the viewer demise.And it's all downhill from there as Gary Cooper's ersatz Frank Lloyd Wright is dogged by the forces of conformity personified by despicable architectural critic Elsworth Toohey. Just one of the many sledgehammersubtle characterizations in this film this villain does everything but sneer and twirl his moustache yes he has a moustache as he declares that Howard must be crushed for daring to be an individual and not submitting to the will of the masses whom Toohey secretly despises.Roark also designs buildings for which his doughy loser friend Peter Keating played by the thoroughly Caucasian Kent Smith then takes the credit. Fortunately Roark at least has the forethought to retain his littleknown right SPOILER ALERT as the real architect to blow up his buildings rather than submit to the crushing tyranny of a conventional facade.Patricia Neal does lend a certain verve to her role as Dominique the sexually repressed and capricious romantic interest who must destroy everything she loves. We know this thanks to an introductory scene where she tilts a large heavy statue that she admires out the window of her highrise apartment. Look out below Dominique's in one of her moods again!. Nor is this the most hamhanded bit of symbolism employed I defy anyone to sit through the scene where Neal gets a blatant case of the hot sloppies while watching Roark get all sweaty pounding granite with a pneumatic drill without collapsing helpless in the grip of a fit of uncontrollable laughter.The rest of the plot is too ludicrous for words but here are a few highlights from Ayn Rand's Bizarro World brand of realismAn architectural critic can wield neardictatorial power by virtue of his vast following among fellow journalists unimaginative businessmen and the easilyswayed masses. And Roger Ebert thinks he has it made!Rape is the best way to a willful and selfdestructive woman's heart.A challenge to one's artistic integrity is best countered with lots of high explosives.SPOILER ALERT If treated to a tedious harangue about the importance of the individual juries will tend to forget that this particular individual is on trial for dynamiting public buildings in a fit of pique.Unless you're a rabid Ayn Rand fan  or a confirmed masochist who gets a sick thrill out of watching great actors humiliate themselves  stay far far away from this rancid hunk of cinematic Limburger.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not too many films can grab your attention with an atypical discussion of individualism inspire you with a character's strength of will disturb you with that same character's cold attitude towards humanity and make you laugh at the script's stiffness and awkwardness at the same time. I don't really know how to approach my commentary on this strange film so I will just list several of my observations. I first learned of this film while watching a documentary on AMC about screenwriters' experiences in Hollywood. This film was chosen by the documentary as an example of what a screenplay shouldn't be! Indeed the dialogue is melodramatic and positively stilted since it is delivered by characters that exist primarily as vessels of philosophical thought not real people that interact with each other. Does Dominique have any favorite hobbies books or radio programs? Or does she just sit around all day fretting about the inanity of the mindless masses only taking a break now and then to throw a valuable statue out her window and onto some poor pedestrian's head because as she says she loves the statue? Gary Cooper even stuttered a lot of his lines like a robot especially in that longwinded courtroom climax. By the way Cooper's character never seemed to be having fun except when he was getting fondled by Dominique or watching her trip and nearly kill herself while trying to run away from him. At times the film came close to acting as a successful examination of themes like resisting convention and finding one's internal independence and freedom a la Chopin's The Awakening. There are some provocative quotes that make good points on these issues. But the heavy dose of Randian antialtruism that the script administers adds a pallor of meanspiritedness and unlikeability to the characters and the screenwriter's points. Rand apparently had a pessimistic view of humanity that was morbid and spiteful in the extreme. Are we to believe that all but a few people comprise an incitable easymanipulated stupid mob of people? The scene where Wynand finds himself opposed by all 15 of his board members all of whom are apparently spineless 'fraidy cats typifies the exaggerated It's everybody against one of me! mentality that pervades the main characters' lives. The direction was much better than I anticipated. And Robert Burks scored big with his cinematography. The modern blackandwhite scenes must have provided him with lots of opportunities. Zaniest quote not word for word Dominique is taken aback at how Gail Wynand bribed Peter Keating to break off his engagement with her. Wynand Oh people do this sort of thing all the time. They just don't talk about it. Max Steiner's score is like Bernard Herrmann's score for Marnie  it is pretty good and exciting to listen to on an album but it is too emotional and highstrung for the screen. Oh did anyone else notice how the piano player at the Enright Building's housewarming party was playing the movie's theme song? Not enough attention was paid to the changes that the Gail Wynand character experienced. He went from strong amoral capitalist to redeemed supporter of the little guy to weak amoral capitalist in mere scenechanges! How could Ellsworth Toohey who is just a writer for a newspaper manage to essentially take over the entire newspaper staff? How come Toohey never smiles or drops his scowl? And does he take some pride from the fact that he looks like and dresses like an evil John Quincy Adams with a mustache? Also how does he have a hand in so many architecture projects? He's just a critic! Are we to believe that a cackling Roger Ebert hangs around the film studios in Hollywood and wields sinister influence over the producers and the films that they make?".

He's just a critic! Are we to believe that a cackling Roger Ebert hangs around the film studios in Hollywood and wields sinister influence over the producers and the films that they make?";

	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to imagine that a movie starring Gary Cooper Pat Neal and Raymond Massey could be this bad. But somehow King Vidor and Ayn Rand achieve this dubious distinction with The Fountainhead. From its dreadful dialog to its overblown set decoration to its overwrought score this picture is a turkey.The story of Howard Roark architect is presented showing a man with an ego the size of his largest building. He is not a pleasant or likable character. He is in a weird romance with the very strange Domenique played by Neal as an irritating fruitcake of a female with a irresolvable inner conflict that the audience surely could not relate to then or now. The chemistry between Cooper's character and Neal's is not just nonexistent it is repellent. Massey does a little better as a powerful man who eventually is shown the limits of that power.We are told of Roark's great talent but are shown samples of his work that are wretched unbalanced monoliths ludicrous while at the same time asking us to agree that they are masterpieces. We are told that the stuffy and selfimportant architectural critic of a newspaper has an ardent following among the common people a very long stretch indeed.Gary Cooper was sorely miscast in a role of a much younger man a man of iron will and granite ego. The role might have been suited to a young Charlton Heston or Gregory Peck. Cooper walks through the role that he clearly does not understand or sympathize with like a zombie. His speech at the courtroom scene is delivered with all the aplomb and effervescence of a flat beer.In every scene the dialog is stilted and unrealistic no one speaks like that nor did they ever. In every interior scene the set is a huge spartan room with unreal spatial expanses.And unfortunately the tale itself is boring and overwrought. It fails to redeem itself at any point. I can't recommend this overcooked turkey for viewing under any circumstances.".

	schema:headline " King Vidor Does the Impossible with Ayn Rand's Help";
	schema:reviewBody "Veteran director King Vidor was assigned the impossible project by Warner Brothers  Make a film out of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. Broadly supported by actors and other subversive elements in the film industry The Fountainhead is sort of a grandfather to the wellbudgeted bigstudio supported Independant film so often made today. Gary Cooper who was close to the pinnacle of his career at the time all but volunteered to play Howard Roark after reading Rand's novel. Rand herself wrote the screenplay and offered the same deal Roark so often repeated in the film  It's my way or the highway.Remarkably Vidor managed to hybridize Rand's intensely philosophical and political dialogical essay in the guise of a novel with his own superb visual skill and came up with a movie which though it has its problems remains interesting entertaining and relevant.Like Rand's novel the film is about the noble struggle of the individual against society  and amounts to a socratic dialog between several intensely powerful intellects Visionary modern architect Howard Roark Cooper erstwhile defeatist social critic Domenique Neal Contemptuous nihilist Wynand Massey and brilliant sociopath Toohey Douglas. Although the film like the book contains a lot of overblown soliloquies and philosophical prose which places components of the story fairly far from reality Vidor's visual style and uncompromising directing made the film work.Howard Roark is a modernist amidst an increasingly collectivist neoclassicist society. Roark will compromise nothing of his own integrity and will not lie compromise or entertain any notions about doing anything for the common good. He is an embodiment of Rand's individualistcapitalist political philosophy and eventually inspires even those who defy him to question themselves. But what will Roark have to sacrifice to fulfill his calling? And will he be able to do so despite his uncompromising approach to life? Although many have derided Cooper's performance and have stated that he was miscastI do not really agree. Cooper himself was disappointed in the lengthy soliloquy he delivered near the end of the film and it is clear that he was not given enough time to make this scene as good as it could have been. By the standards of the time a oneday shoot for a scene like this must have seemed like an eternity. However today I would not be surprised if a contemporary director would give an actor of Cooper's ability and stature several days and multiple cuts. Roark is a man of deeds not words and Cooper's unassuming almost humble matteroffact approach to the character is a surprising and consistent take on Rand's great protagonist. Nevertheless Cooper is in terms of acting the weakest member of the principal cast. Neal is excellent and Massey and Douglas are both unforgettable in their support roles.Recommendation Great fun for Rand fans and those who enjoy politically and philosophically charged dialog. Not recommended for artfilm fans as anything but an historic curiosity. Not recommended for fans of action films.".

Cooper just doesn't possess the fire that this character requires.

	schema:reviewBody "Unless one really digs Ayn Rand's philosophical theories THE FOUNTAINHEAD will leave you pretty cold. Yet the film has it's fascinations. Cooper Massey and Neal manage to make their ridiculous dialog sound meaningful particularly Cooper's courtroom defense. King Vidor was able to have some fun with the sexual symbolism of skyscrapers and Neal's yearning for Cooper a real yearning as it turned out  as they began a long love affair while on the movie.But to me the most interesting fascination is that of the character of the chief villain in the story Ellsworth Tooey Robert Douglas. Douglas normally played in the words of the novelist George MacDonald Fraser one of those villains with the sibilant esses in their speech like Henry Daniel George Macready Basil Rathbone who usually played costume parts. Douglas was Sir Christopher Hatton in THE VIRGIN QUEEN and the Duke of Lorca in Errol Flynn's DON JUAN. His characters are always plotting or carrying out some political double cross. Here he is out of his normal background. It's modern times and he is the critic on Raymond Massey's newspaper on architecture. But he is on costume even here  usually wearing tales and a top hat. How such a ridiculously dressed character would imagine he'd be taken seriously by the world is beyond me. Most people really don't care about architecture unless they are going to be affected by a building they will live in or work in. They rarely read books about it or newspaper columns about it. Yet Tooey we are told has great influence and uses it to hurt the public. He boasts to his friends that he favors anything that will give the common man ugly looking housing and business structures. Just how come he gets his jollies from this is never explained  sheer cussedness I guess.But given his appearance like former Governor Dewey of New York he looks like the groom on top of a wedding cake how can he be seriously taken by that public? If he dressed like a common worker he might have a chance but in the garb he wears everyone would suspect him.In the film he succeeds in manipulating his acolytes and allies into most of the important departments of the newspaper owned by Massey so that he basically takes it away from Massey who kills himself when he realizes his dreams of guiding public opinion are sand castles in the wind. That is not quite how the novel ends  in fact the novel deals with Tooey in a far more effective manner than the movie did. When the movie last sees Tooey he is in court listening in anger to Roark's courageous or longwinded depending on your view defense of the artist's right to control his vision. In the novel there is a follow up to Tooey's apparently successful coup at the newspaper.In the novel a day or so after Tooey has demonstrated his control of the newspaper's staff and policies to Gail Wynand Massey he comes back in triumph to resume his control of the paper. He is told to report to his desk which is on the top floor where Wynand's office is. As he enters the building Tooey notices how few people seem to be around but goes upstairs. A secretary ushers him into the office and he finds his desk there  opposite Wynand's. This pleases him to some extent it is symbolically showing he is equal to the publisher. Wynand is busy with some paperwork at his desk and looks up and nods at Tooey and then resumes his paperwork. Tooey walks to his desk and sits down. He starts readying his desk for work but is amazed to find nothing on the desk to look at or deal with. He waits. He taps the desk. He looks around the room and out the window at the nice view. It begins to bother him  this absolute silence from Wynand. Why no comments? He considers the situation and realizes that the publisher has just been humiliated and trounced by him so that may explain it. Tooey starts speaking to Wynand and explains that although what happened was...perhaps somewhat highhanded and humiliating to Wynand actually Tooey is a human being and they can probably get along very well. Wynand looks up doesn't say a word and resumes his paperwork.It slowly begins driving Tooey mad. Why is he here if there is nothing to do but watch Wynand? Didn't the paper tiger publisher learn his lesson the other day? And where is everyone else?Suddenly the clock strikes noon. Wynand looks up and puts his papers into his attach case. He gets up from behind his desk. He then tells Tooey1 as of this moment the newspaper ceases to exist. It is being closed down. The staff has been paid off and the various company properties are being sold.2. Tooey will find a check for the balance of his contractual salary for the time left on the contract. As for his future Wynand does not care what he does but he won't get any reference from him.Tooey pops up one last time just before the novel ends. He has found another job but he has to start at the bottom again he won't be headlining any column like he did on Wynand's newspaper. While he is politely listened to by others at his new job his reputation is not great because his allies at his last job all lost their jobs.Somehow that was a more satisfactory conclusion to the novel than what is in the film.

	schema:headline " The Rise of the Individual";
	schema:reviewBody "The Fountainhead sets off by means of a powerful question 'Do you wanna stand alone against the whole world?'. This may seem an unusual statement to start a film yet from that moment on the viewer will witness the path of a man who attempts to precisely do so striving against the whole world.King Vidor's film introduces us to an innovative and talented architect Howard Roark Gary Cooper whose artistic conception does not suit the public's taste and who has to face different forces that push him to conform to the conventions of his society. After an unsuccessful beginning in the profession Roark is hired to design his first big project but the influential newspaper The Banner directed by Gail Wynand Raymond Massey carries out an aggressive campaign in order to discredit the architect. Only backed up by his ideals and integrity Roark will struggle to carry on with his career.As this plot line manifests The Fountainhead explores an ancient debate  that of the individual vs. society  and its emphasis is overtly on defending the aspirations of the first over the expectations of the second. Thus the film offers a pessimistic portrait of society  controlled by the powerful and the media and having no mindset of its own  that is fairly downtoearth. He who does not conform is seen as a danger not only because he cannot be subdued but also because he may be an agent of change and consequently those who are in power try to erase one's individuality. However the resolution of the conflict that The Fountainhead offers is not very plausible and it makes the film lose some of its strength.

One may consider that it is not perfect that there are better ways of conceiving and creating films.

	onyx:emotionText "The Fountainhead sets off by means of a powerful question 'Do you wanna stand alone against the whole world?'. This may seem an unusual statement to start a film yet from that moment on the viewer will witness the path of a man who attempts to precisely do so striving against the whole world.King Vidor's film introduces us to an innovative and talented architect Howard Roark Gary Cooper whose artistic conception does not suit the public's taste and who has to face different forces that push him to conform to the conventions of his society. After an unsuccessful beginning in the profession Roark is hired to design his first big project but the influential newspaper The Banner directed by Gail Wynand Raymond Massey carries out an aggressive campaign in order to discredit the architect. Only backed up by his ideals and integrity Roark will struggle to carry on with his career.As this plot line manifests The Fountainhead explores an ancient debate  that of the individual vs. society  and its emphasis is overtly on defending the aspirations of the first over the expectations of the second. Thus the film offers a pessimistic portrait of society  controlled by the powerful and the media and having no mindset of its own  that is fairly downtoearth. He who does not conform is seen as a danger not only because he cannot be subdued but also because he may be an agent of change and consequently those who are in power try to erase one's individuality. However the resolution of the conflict that The Fountainhead offers is not very plausible and it makes the film lose some of its strength. As the story goes on the viewer follows Roark and is touched by the desolation of the atmosphere created feeling its lack of oxygen yet at the end this anxiety is dissipated so the impact of the film on the audience is reduced.

Ayn Rand had obviously never been to a movie or had complete contempt for movies and their audiences because she had no concept of what dialogue does in a drama or what it needs to sound like to be effective. She thinks that descriptive prose can be shoved into actors' mouths and that makes it dialogue. This is probably one of the most literate screenplays of the 40's but it is incredibly awful nonetheless.It is a testament to Gary Cooper's great abilities as an actor that he actually manages to make this stuff sound like a human being might speak it. None of the other actors achieves this feat although Patricia Neal sporadically approaches it. If you focus on Cooper you might be seduced into thinking this is a movie. If you listen to the other characters you realize that it's a diatribe being read  rather stiltedly in most cases  by some fairly talented but hopelessly overwhelmed actors.Ayn Rand's celebration of the ego reaches a zenith in writing the screenplay from her own book. The screenplay also demonstrates the big hole in her argument just because you've got an ego doesn't mean you've got talent. Like the architect Roark she wanted to keep possession of her ideas. So she designed the script from her novel. Unlike Roark she was able to see that the ideas were expressed her way. In doing so she destroyed whatever value this movie might have had in more competent hands.".

The Fountainhead concerns an architect Howard Roark who despite controversy sticks to his designs without altering them to please anyone. Because of this he becomes the brunt of a hate campaign by a tabloid newspaper The Banner.It's obvious from some of the comments on this board that many people are unfamiliar with the book. Unfortunately the way the book was adapted if you don't know it I'm not even sure you can follow what goes on. The buildings Roark Dominque Wyand et al. are all symbols  the buildings are what man can achieve Roark is the selfish artist whose work has integrity playing into one of Rand's main philosophies  man has a right to live for his own sake without altruism without bowing to the masses. Wyand is the brainwasher who cares about power his architecture columnist believes in suppressing genius as it is threatening  etc. Rand's novel itself is extremely prophetic the tabloid inferences and the rise of mediocrity being just two examples and therefore is timely today. It just didn't transfer well onto the screen. Symbols don't. There was too much material cut and the screenplay was adapted seemingly with the supposition that everyone knew the book. On top of that many of the scenes look almost fake from the use of a lot of process shots giving the movie a bizarre sensibility.Patricia Neal is astonishingly stunning and wears gorgeous fashions as Dominique the sexually repressed turned sexually charged woman who gets turned on by Howard and his work. When I first read The Fountainhead I kept picturing Dominique as Faye Dunaway and with her cold beauty Neal is certainly the '50s Dominique. Raymond Massey is excellent as Gale Wyand the Rupert Murdock character and Kent Smith does a good job as a weasel architect friend of Howard's.Now we come to Howard himself Gary Cooper. Ayn Rand was one of Cooper's biggest fans from the time she emigrated from Russia and worked in Hollywood as an extra. She was of course thrilled beyond belief when he agreed to play Howard. There is a photograph of the short Rand gazing up at the chiseled handsome Cooper and she's practically drooling. After Rand worked  I can't remember if it was months or years  on Howard's big speech in the courtroom Cooper told her after he finished filming it that he never understood the speech. I'm fairly certain he didn't understand the rest of the role either and that he had never read the book. A more gloriouslooking charismatic man to play Howard you couldn't have found but did he understand this role the way he understood Lou Gehrig? I doubt it. Did Rand for all her artistic integrity care? I doubt it. In the end that great philosopher that giant intellectual Ayn Rand was in reality a woman like any other.If you must see The Fountainhead read the book first which is fantastic. If you're not going to read it I'd skip the movie even though like Rand and Neal I love Gary Cooper.".

	schema:headline " Score not by Franz Waxman";
	schema:reviewBody "Whatever you think of the score it's by Max Steiner not Franz Waxman. Just an FYI.Personally I think it's overwrought and inappropriate. It's a movie about a hardcore uncompromising modernist artist or least a cartoon version of one and the score is a typical 40s melange of Richard Strauss and Rachmanninof with perhaps a touch of Scriabin here and there. I'm not sure what Roark would have listened to but somehow I doubt it would have been postRomantic treacle although apparently that's what Rand liked since her favorite composer was Rachmanninof.Others have excoriated the casting but I just have to pile on was ever an Alist Hollywood star so dreadfully miscast in a highprofile picture as was Gary Cooper as Roark? I can't think of one. Wrong physical type WAY too old and completely wrong temperament. Clearly he had not a clue what the role was about of course no rational human being would so perhaps that's not really his fault. Not that I think the best cast in the world could have rescued this script which as others have pointed out hardly contains a single sentence you can imagine any human being ever uttering. I know Rand never claimed to writing realistic dialog but still...But more importantly of all the artistic professions Rand could have chosen for her hardcore uncompromising modernist artist architecture is probably the worst. Building buildings like it or not is a thoroughly cooperative endeavor in which the architect is only one of many players. A crucial one of course but still only one and almost never the one who puts up the money. A building is simply not a picture you can look at or not or buy or not not a piece of music you can listen to or not or buy the recording or not not a play or movie you can choose to attend or not or even walk out of if you don't like it. A building is a place in which real people live andor work. A building design is not just a work of imagination it is virtually always a work for hire commissioned by a client who has specific needs and conditions that must be met. The architect can always refuse the commission but once accepted it must be lived up to. And guess what? That often involves a certain level of compromise.The only reason I even give The Fountainhead as high a rating as 2 is that it is gorgeous to look at.However as a glimpse at the appalling philosophy of an appalling human being the movie is probably pretty good. Watching it will save the endless hours of slogging through her books. And as you do remember that the current economic situation can be largely laid at Rand's feet since much of it is the result of her acolyte Alan Greenspan applying her ideas to real life.".

This is the direct benefit of having Ayn Rand write the screenplay.The acting was superb for the intended purpose most especially that of Gary Cooper. The characters are hard and sharp. This was certainly not an accident or oversight in the screenplay as the purpose of the film as to define a philosophy not to entertain the simple with the typical middleoftheroad.The black and white cinematography was wonderfully done. The acting again was perfectly suited for the intended purpose. The depiction of Ayn Rand's philosophy was beautiful.You don't have to agree with Ayn Rand to appreciate this film.

Which is not to say the movie's not entertaining  it is. It's just not very good.This was Ayn Rand's final screenplay in her brief Hollywood career which is a tragedy for connoisseurs of bad soap opera. It's tempting to blame director King Vidor for all the scenes where characters turn their backs on the hero to declaim their speeches to just left of the camera  a staple of daytime serials ever since  but the speeches themselves are so overthetop that avoiding each other's eyes may have been the only way for actors to deliver them without cracking up.Rand's scenes constantly begin with some character summoning the heroic architect Howard Roark to deliver a snide ultimatum which he impassively rejects at which point the Other Character turns on a dime and flings himherself at his feet metaphorically or in the case of Patricia Neal's Dominique literally.Even when Roark is not around people behave with bizarre inconsistency as if different writers had been assigned successive scenes. Take Raymond Massey's Gail Wynand whose sexually ambiguous name spelled like Gail Russell rather than Gale Gordon seems to explain his lack of passion for his wife and his devotion to Roark. Wynand is willing to ruin his paper rather than retract his backing for Roark...until his board of directors softly suggest that he back down. Whereupon he instantly turns on Roark so viciously that suicide after rehiring Roark is his only possible atonement.Wynand's wifetobe Dominique is a particularly kinky customer humiliating and abusing Roark until he satisfies her by in oblique Old Hollywood fashion raping her. Dominique definitely goes Scarlett O'Hara one better in bringing rough sex to the forefront in movies but her particular fetish forces her to go through the whole movie in a temper until she surrenders to Roark's perfection and Finally Gets What She Needs. You buy the affair because of the palpable heat between the gorgeous Neal and Gary Cooper...not because of the loony dialog.The minor characters behave as if the movie were set or at least written on Mars Angry mobs boycott a paper and tear down newsstands all to protest the firing of the reptilian architecture critic Toohey who dresses like Clemenceau and proclaims a selfloathing version of Marxism that would have earned him a icepick from Stalin. How did this fruitcake get so popular with the Joe Sixpacks of 1949? The hilarious thing about the film is that everyone on view accepts that its hero is a genius. Roark a paperthin conceit instead of a character never doubts himself for an instant which imparts even to Gary Cooper an aura of unbearable smugness.So where is dramatic conflict to come from? Well from the embittered paranoia that pervades every other character in the story. Even Roark's admirers are convinced he's too brilliant to succeed while the villains are determined to bring him down not because they're Philistines or because his designs look as cold and forbidding as Albert Speer's but because they hate Genius. After two hours of Roark's tinJesus certainty you start to sympathize with them.Imagine a movie in which the antagonists are not motivated by different ideals or greed or lust or revenge...but because they hate the hero's Goodness...and you have some idea of the depth of the writing in The Fountainhead.Robert Douglas on vacation from his usual swashbuckler villainy is excellent as the scheming Toohey. Ironically with his gift for glitteryeyed resentment Douglas might have been far more believable as Roark than the stiff earnest Cooper...but this casting would have laid bare the hero's narcissism and rendered him unwatchable.As it is Cooper that laconic cowboy American is visibly flummoxed by delivering Roark's rant in the courtroom climax. He spouts Rand's rambling derision for the common man in a speech that he scarcely seems to believe...as if he knew it would have earned him a clip in the jaw from Capra's Mr. Deeds.".

	schema:reviewBody "A climatic moment in THE FOUNTAINHEAD comes when its hero architect Howard Roark Gary Cooper blows up a building. The one in question is a building he designed but which is being built with changes that he did not approve. The building represents the world that Howard despises a world that doesn't recognize his genius and dares to question his superior talents. Therefore in his egocontaminated mind destroying the building isn't just a monumental temper tantrum but a political statement informing the world that it had better conform to his peculiar concept of individual freedom.A few years back THE FOUNTAINHEAD could have easily been shrugged off as a ludicrous display of knuckleheaded idiocy pseudointellectual rants mixing unbridled cynicism with delusional snobbery. However in the wake of September 11 2001 it is harder to take such a cavalier attitude. Howard blows up a building that represents all that he finds corrupt in an attempt to make the world bow to his philosophical superiority. How does that make him any different from the 19 hijackers and their puppeteers who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon? THE FOUNTAINHEAD is such a ridiculous movie that it is easy to laugh it off. With its pseudoGerman expressionism look and its stylized archly overwritten dialogue it begs to be mocked as inconsequential camp. Like an elaborate joke its cheesy Freudian symbolism and deadpan melodramatic performances would seem ripe for Carol Burnett and Harvey Korman to parody verbatim as one of the movie satires on her old TV show. If you could overlook the sobering reality that the film is based on a respected philosophy then certainly THE FOUNTAINHEAD would be good for a few hearty chuckles and a couple of eyerolling groans  all at the expense of the poor actors trapped therein. But THE FOUNTAINHEAD is a propaganda film existing to illustrate the views of Ayn Rand the author of the original book. Unfortunately or fortunately depending on your point of view the film is such an absurd mess that it is difficult to ascertain just what Rand's views are this despite the fact that she penned the screenplay. Apparently Rand believed in objectivism the notion that man as an individual is of supreme importance but not in a Capraesque sense. It seems that to Rand a person should have but one goal in life and that is to satisfy one's self. God mankind country friends and family are secondary and trivial concerns. Selfishness is the one truism and its own reward. If she had written IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE Old Man Potter would be the hero not George Bailey. Which brings us back to Coop and his little sticks of dynamite. In one of the most idiotic courtroom sequences this side of Woody Allen's BANANAS Howard defends his act of urban terrorism with a confusing maze of selfrighteous platitudes and smug displays of pious double talk. Delivered by a monotoned Cooper in a longwinded monologue his defense is barely comprehensible even after listening to his convoluted arguments repeatedly. He claims to be fighting for the right for man to exist but man seems to be only creators like himself as opposed to parasites which apparently would be just about everybody else on the face of the earth. He seems to be claiming the building as intellectual property not real estate He designed the building therefore he owned it. Forget everybody else from the investors to the laborers they are all just parasites feeding off Roark's genius. Should one therefore assume that Rand believed that the actors the director and all others involved in making this film were also mere parasites feeding off her genius? Despite such convoluted logic and the overall incompetence of the film as a whole there is something very scary about this entire enterprise. If Rand or anybody else wants to belch up lame scenarios about delusional selfabsorbed jerks that is their literary license. But when she seriously argues that such delusions justify violent unprovoked criminal acts then her philosophy becomes renegade. As such her hokey cinematic lecture suddenly morphs into a disturbing manifesto for mayhem. All acts of terrorism be it bombing abortion clinics or ROTC offices begin with a seed of genuine righteousness. When that seed grows into armed violence such philosophical selfrighteousness is the first victim. Her Roark is not a heroic figure a man of integrity fighting for his beliefs he is a ruthless arrogant megalomaniac. And if the buildings shown in the film are any indication he is also one heck of a terrible architect.Another disturbing element of the film is that it came out in 1949 on the heels of World War II. Throughout THE FOUNTAINHEAD Roark and his lovergroupie Dominique Francon Patricia Neal repeatedly refer to superior individuals whose genius makes them rise above the mob and above the law and who should not be restricted by a common sense of morality. It is fascist drivel not based on race or religion or ethnicity but on the sheer arrogance of a supposed intellectualism devoid of any trace of humanity. Objectivism appears to be based less on rational thought than on simpleminded paranoia. It seems Rand sees everyone from the ignorant masses to the power elite conspiring to oppress the loyal few who kowtow to her ideals. She obviously hates communism but worse she appears to hate democracy as well. It has a chilling similarity to the nationalism that propelled Hitler into power little over a decade prior. THE FOUNTAINHEAD with straightfaced piousness boldly defends its sociopathic ideology praising not the genius of the individual but the potential cruelty of the individual ego.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am hoping the viewing of this movie will end a week of viewing films with bad even execrable philosophy. But I just couldn't avoid this. It was a big film and based on a best seller an enormously good seller and an influential book.For decades it was the standard path for a college freshman to read this and imagine himself different. Probably still the case in Texas. The ideas here are hardly original but they are presented so boldly and with such panache that the author has spawned countless political religious movements in the US. Misguided kids thinking they were geniuses as measured by the degree of rejection by society began doing nothing but court rejection.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the major problems with The Fountainhead not mentioned by any of the IMdB reviewers is the time period the film is set in. The novel makes no bones about being set in the 1920s but the film seems to be set in the 30s or 40s. I bring this up because the ultramodern buildings protagonist Howard Roark designs would seem exotic before the Depression but by the Thirties such structures were becoming accepted and nowadays they are the rule. In the film Roark's designs are not accepted because they aren't Classical in some sense. In any case Roark's creations look like cartoons of Art Deco buildings while the Classical buildings of his nebbish chumantithesis Peter Keating are just photos of skyscrapers with classical facades pasted onto the ground floors. Another problem is Roark's character the man is a sociopath with not even a tiny shred of empathy yet he can design buildings that his clients dream about and which fit their locations perfectly. Rand's character could possibly survive as an engineer a job Roark briefly holds in the novel but no architect can work like that. One of the keystones of both the book and the film is that HR cannot compromise on designs either when they are blueprints or when they are under construction. My question is what if Roark goofs? Would he tolerate a redesign if something in one of his buildings proved unfeasable? And what about people remodeling one of his buildings years after it was completed? Roark's model the architect Frank L. Wright often suffered design failures and pressured his clients never to remodel namely because he also designed all the furnishings for his homes so I can only suppose that Roark would rather let a building collapse than change his perfect plans.Besides the impossible Roark we are faced with the bizarre snob Ellsworth Toohey. Toohey is supposed to be the embodiment of evil but he comes off on screen as a sneering Snidely Whiplashlike character whose attemps to drive Roark under look like cries for attention. Toohey is an architecture critic and intellectual public figure but he loves mediocrity. Why we are never told but probably because Rand equates mediocrity with socialism and in the novel Toohey is a Red. Inbetween the two poles of Roark and Toohey are the aforementioned yob Peter Keating Raymond Massey as protoRupert Murdoch Gail Wynand and Toohey's boss and Patricia Neal as Toohey's coworker Dominique Francon. As you can tell Rand loves giving the bad guys weird names the good guys WASPy names the love interests romance novel names and the tools names that rhyme with bad schoolroom behavior. And you can tell what is going to happen to these characters from the outset because despite its intellectual pretensions The Fountainhead is just another noir film. Somebody will snitch somebody will commit suicide somebody will just dissapear from the procedings and the protagonist will end up with the girl. I just wish that that noir film were The Big Sleep and not The Fountainhead.".

Based on Ayn Rand's popular novel THE FOUNTAINHEAD unites two of Hollywood's most legendary stars Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal doing some of their finest work ever. Though many people who have seen this film claim that Cooper was miscast he still gives a memorable performance and makes a strong impression. Cooper plays a gifted architect whose fierce individualism nearly ruins his career. Patricia Neal is an equally headstrong critic whose interest in Cooper goes beyond his work. Neal is a perfect match for the tough willofiron Cooper. In fact the chemistry between these two is amazing. Though their intimate moments are fairly tame by today's standards Cooper and Neal ignite fire in their lovemaking scenes. It's not surprising that their onscreen romance carried over into real life. My favorite scene is where an infuriated Neal rides up on horseback and thrashes her whip across Cooper's face when he rejects her notso subtle invitation up to her bedroom. This scene could have easily turned campy but King Vidor is such a skilled director and Cooper and Neal are such distinguished and professional actors that the scene comes off in a rather smooth and serious fashion.".

All the elements were probably at their best for this film  the script was entertaining from start to finish the characters were likable and interesting the music was at its most powerful and memorable the filmography was its most striking and the monster action incredible. This was also the movie with hands down the greatest Godzilla costume ever created. Known as Godzilla vs. The Thing before being changed to the present title somewhere along the line I cannot stress enough what a great film this is. Godzilla makes an awesome first appearance and from there the movie actually features a lot of very realistic rearscreen photography of Godzilla roaming around real Japan landscapes and streets. There are some truly amazing shots of Godzilla coming from behind real buildings and mountains as the usual crowds run for their lives. For some reason Godzilla films in the original series very rarely used this process after this film and in the rare case they did it didn't look nearly as good as it does here.I am very fortunately to actually own this film on the Simitar Godzilla DVD box set release from 1999 which features this movie in perfect quality and in widescreen. This box set is of the highest quality totally blowing away the insulting Sony Godzilla DVD box set with some of the same movies including Godzilla vs. Mothra only in very poor quality. If you have the hundreds of dollars to spend finding a used Simitar DVD set is the way to go. Of course another plus is that this is the only Godzilla movie ever to have monster scenes filmed for the American release that were not included in the Japanese release. Of course seeing this on widescreen rules!This is also a landmark film because this is the last film of the original series where Godzilla is completely on the bad side. Absolutely not to be missed by any serious monster or scififantasy fan.".

This film like the one that preceded it is part of a downward trend in the series' production values.  It certainly is tough to take seriously.  But...so flippin' what?  Despite screamingly obvious flaws this flick is a blast.  The surprisingly rich storyline involves corporate greed nuclear testing and totally bizarre mysticism.  The science fiction and fantasy elements blend well and it's fascinating as always to get the occasional insight into Japanese culture.The acting is obviously good even in the dubbed version and some of the directing isn't bad although Honda did a much better job on the first film  perhaps he had less money for this one.  The fights are a bit silly of course but there is the occasional thrilling moment such as when Godzilla's head gets set on fire and when he melts a whole mess of nicely detailed model tanks.  Ifkube's dramatic score elevates the film considerably except of course when he gets into  wailing horns turf which is when I always reach for the volume down button.If you can't stand the cheese stay out of Godzilla's way.

Godzilla looks amazing in this film it is the best costume used for Godzilla in the entire series.

Also Godzilla is once again a threat to Japan love when he is a bad guy.However as Godzilla first starts attacking Japan he seems to be dazed. He gets his tail stuck in a tower and then he stumbles down into a giant house destroying it. I do not know why this sequence of events happens are they trying to make it look funny when Godzilla is attacking? I do not know.

Mothra is the opposite of Godzilla beautiful harmless and not evil. So whenever he would fight Godzilla I always wanted Godzilla to destroy him. So this film is half good on that aspect. Godzilla does get to destroy the adult Mothra but losing to those two larval Mothra's is something that I will always remember as one of Godzilla's most humiliating defeats. How can he lose to them? THere is no way. That is my main and only complaint in this film.This is often regarded as the last film where Godzilla is a bad guy. That is true in that this is the last time in the Showa Series that Godzilla attacks Japan from his own free will. He does go after Japan again in Godzilla vs Monster Zero and Destroy ALl Monsters but that is when he is under control from aliens. So I guess this is the last time he is a complete bad guy although the fact that he is on Monsterland imprisoned is because he probably would have gone after Japan again. ALso I always thought that he was a bad guy in Monster Zero who knows what he would have done had he not been under control by the Xians. OK I am getting off the point but hopefully you see where I am coming from.SO this is a good film one of the best. Even with Mothra in it the worst monster it still succeeds mainly because this is one of the last times that Godzilla is a bad guy the whole movie in a showa series film.Maybe THE last time but that is arguable So even though the ending is awful go and see it because it really is a great film.".

A greedy developer has placed huge machines to suck dry a part of the ocean near Tokyo so he can put luxury condos there. After a storm a giant egg washes up on the beach nearby and is immediately put on public display. The developer's plans go awry when he disrupts Godzilla's rest and the monster goes stomping through Tokyo again. It's up to the elderly Mothra and then to its two offspring to save Tokyo from destruction. Special thanks to Molly Malloy for the synopsis. So the acting is this flick is pretty good not Oscar worthy or anything but still good. The special effects are decent for the time. To my surprise it is harder to see the strings of Mothra unlike in some movies I see like GODZILLA AND MOTHRA BATTLE FOR THE EARTH. You know it is interesting how an older Godzilla flick good hide the strings and yet a newer one couldn't. So all in all MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA is a great edition to the series.".

It's up to the elderly Mothra and then to its two offspring to save Tokyo from destruction. Special thanks to Molly Malloy for the synopsis. So the acting is this flick is pretty good not Oscar worthy or anything but still good. The special effects are decent for the time. To my surprise it is harder to see the strings of Mothra unlike in some movies I see like GODZILLA AND MOTHRA BATTLE FOR THE EARTH. You know it is interesting how an older Godzilla flick good hide the strings and yet a newer one couldn't. So all in all MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA is a great edition to the series.";

	schema:headline " One of Honda's Best Works!!";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the top Gfilms most definitely probably one of the best out of not just the Showa series but the whole franchise. Its number three on my personal top ten Godzilla film list right after Godzilla vs. Destroyah and Gojira. I think it's a great work of classic cinema in general not just as a Japanese giant monster movie. It was the last film before Godzilla began his transformation into a hero and worse in the 70s a child star. It wouldn't be for another 20 years in 1984's Return of Godzilla that the Monster King would go back to his roots. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy some of those films after all I highly enjoy Terror of MechaGodzilla and I absolutely adore Ghidorah The 3Headed Monster and Destroy All Monsters. But none of those have the effect of this one. Firstly it was for the most part realistic and didn't have any ridiculous story lines like latter Godzilla films like Godzilla vs. Gigan and Godzilla vs. Megalon. Plus it didn't involve aliens not that I mind that. It's just that after 1968's Destroy All Monsters it becomes too often a part of the story. The plot is excellent work and the human characters I found entertaining. One of the best parts of the film is when the moral of the movie is exposed as Kenji Sahara's character tries to get away with the money after shooting his supposed business partner Kumayama played by Yoshibumi Tajima in the back in cold blood. However his cleangetaway is inadvertently ruined by Godzilla who in turn kills him. Director Honda was a World War II veteran and abhorred violence and yet we clearly see when Kumayama is shot in the head. It's a graphic type of violence rarely seen in the early films though shoot outs would become common in the late 60s and 70s era Gfilms.The message is that for one greed never prevails. The antinuclear tone is still there after all a Geiger counter alerts the characters to Godzilla's location right before he awakes. But it takes a back seat for another powerful message that being the need for all nations to unite and stop being against one another the movement towards a brotherhood of men. Honda always had a beautiful story to tell and this is one of his best. Akira Takarada and Jun Tazaki star as well as well as Hiroshi Koizumi. So many great actors in one film including Yuriko Hoshi who stars in the 2000 film Godzilla vs. Megaguirus. The occasional comedic scene actually blends in but is not shown through the monsters. Godzilla's role in the film is very similar to his role in the first film an unstoppable terror who walks the earth to remind humans of the mistake of playing with the fire of the gods as one character calls it.Godzilla looked even better than he did in the last film and he really defines what the King of the Monsters is all about maniacal and brutal yet symbolic destruction. His eyes are powerful and imposing and the spikes on his head are a nice touch. This is my favorite version for sure. There isn't a single touch of campiness in his movements or attacks the best part of it all. The Monster King has another grand entrance and Ifukube's music really embodies his rampage. One theme where he is attacking Nagoya is sad and touching while another when he first emerges is dark and terrifying. Mothra both adult and larva look incredible and gave completely realistic movements throughout the film. The web effect is very nicely done and the adult throws a few neat moves in the epic fight.When the two monsters battle Tsubaraya makes sure the SFX give a presentable and creative show. The Mothra marionette is massive and moves as if it were a living creature. There are even shots where she appears as if she's actually breathing. The attention to detail in the film is monumental. And the many battles with the military are unique among Gfilms especially against the artificial lightning generators. For once Godzilla is hurt actually brought down to the ground but of course not stopped. And for once in a lifetime the American version doesn't go overboard and is pretty much left alone.I actually like the dubbing for the U.S. cut and I can honestly watch either version. One of Honda's best works Mothra vs. Godzilla is a total ten star.".

Along with the original GOJIRA I vigorously recommended this entry as your first movie in the series if you've never seen one before. If you don't enjoy this one it's unlikely you'd appreciate the others of this era.Godzilla initially makes a sensational first entrance coming up from out of the ground with his huge tail smashing through the earth and swirling about the air as tiny Tokyo citizens flee in panic! But his often hailed catastrophic stroll through the city is not as flawless as many fans think for one thing his clumsy tail gets caught in a tower and causes him to stumble and fall into the buildings he demolishes! Godzilla isn't so much terrorizing at first as he is clutzy and this intoxicatedlike introduction is the only demerit for me in this otherwise perfect Godzilla experience. I must also take a moment here to comment on the oftpraised Godzilla costume used for this movie  it's not even close to the best costume of all the films as there is an obvious phony and rubbery upper jaw which flops and quivers throughout the film most noticeably while the monster is slipping and sliding into buildings like a drunk. But I will grant that Godzilla's eyes are perfectly evil and nasty in this installment as he is still clearly a mean old monster at this point of the series.The two little miniature ladies from Mothra's island make their first appearance since the original MOTHRA and they're always a delight to see. The story is well written as Mothra's giant egg washes ashore during a violent storm and then two unscrupulous Tokyo businessmen try to make a greedy profit from it ignoring the twin fairies' pleas to return it to its rightful owner Mothra. Mothra has always been one of my favorite Japanese monster characters and she manages to hold her own against Godzilla in the final battle along with the aid of her two newborn caterpillars who emerge from mom's giant egg as Godzilla tries to destroy it. It is convincing and completely satisfying how these underdogs manage to give the King of Monsters a true run for his money during their confrontation.This is a hugely satisfying Toho monster picture well complimented by Akira Ifukube's lively musical score and well staged by director Ishiro Honda. The English version goes by the title of GODZILLA VS. THE THING and it actually is very capably dubbed as presented there in its original American International Pictures format. It's also interesting to note that this was a rare case where the Japanese filmmakers actually added an entire extra sequence of the army fighting Godzilla for U.S. audiences which is not included in the actual Asian release. 12 out of ".

	schema:headline " One of the best kaiju epics wellmade and vastly entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "I first watched this film as Godzilla vs. the Thing in the late '60s haven gotten special permission to stay up late. My friends and I speculated what kind of horror The Thing would be but our list of possibilities never included a giant moth. Nevertheless I liked the movie then and love it now. From the evocative opening music playing over an excellently executed typhoon to the climatic duel between the titular creatures Mothra vs Godzilla is perhaps the best overall film in the Toho kaiju franchise. The story opens with the discovery of a gigantic egg floating off a stormwracked shore and the appearance of two miniature twins the pop duo The Peanuts who plead for the return of the egg which they identify as Mothra's. They find supporters in Professor Shunsuke Miura Hiroshi Koizumi and news team Ichiro Sakai Akira Takarada and Junko Nakanishi Yuriko Hoshi but human greed wins out and the egg becomes the property of a shady developer who is building an immense industrial area near the shore. The construction awakens Godzilla in one of the film's best scenes and in the ensuing carnage the egg is threatened. While the JDF is futilely trying to stop Godzilla's rampage Sakai Nakanishi and Miura travel to Infant Island to beg for Mothra's help. They are rebuffed by the natives and the twins who blame the outside world for the devastation of their island during hydrogen bomb testing but Mothra herself intervenes and agrees to return to Japan to try to stop Godzilla. This sets the stage for a number of well executed battles between monsters leading up to the climatic showdown. The film is extremely well done especially the integration of models and live action. The matte shots with people in the foreground and Godzilla and miniatures in the back ground are excellent and allow for scenes of Godzilla and Mothra moving in the distance which greatly enhances the sense of their enormousness. The acting although a bit hard to judge in subtitled films is quite good with a cast full of Toho regulars. The movie fourth in the franchise is a return to the sobriety of the first two with limited comic relief mostly centered around eggs and also marks the beginning of a metaphysical or spiritual trend in the series. Mothra who is worshiped on Infant Island is essentially a God and her giving up her life for humans only to be reborn as a new saviour when the egg hatches is a none too subtle allegory. Overall this is a great film for fans or the genre as well as for anyone willing to suspend their disbelief long enough to immerse themselves in the world of suitmation kaiju. Note I am commenting on an English subtitled Japanese release of the film. The dubbed English version Godzilla vs. The Thing which contains limited additional footage there is an American rocket strike on Godzilla is supposedly much better than previous efforts e.g. 1955's dire Gigantis the Fire Monster.".

They are rebuffed by the natives and the twins who blame the outside world for the devastation of their island during hydrogen bomb testing but Mothra herself intervenes and agrees to return to Japan to try to stop Godzilla. This sets the stage for a number of well executed battles between monsters leading up to the climatic showdown. The film is extremely well done especially the integration of models and live action. The matte shots with people in the foreground and Godzilla and miniatures in the back ground are excellent and allow for scenes of Godzilla and Mothra moving in the distance which greatly enhances the sense of their enormousness. The acting although a bit hard to judge in subtitled films is quite good with a cast full of Toho regulars. The movie fourth in the franchise is a return to the sobriety of the first two with limited comic relief mostly centered around eggs and also marks the beginning of a metaphysical or spiritual trend in the series. Mothra who is worshiped on Infant Island is essentially a God and her giving up her life for humans only to be reborn as a new saviour when the egg hatches is a none too subtle allegory. Overall this is a great film for fans or the genre as well as for anyone willing to suspend their disbelief long enough to immerse themselves in the world of suitmation kaiju. Note I am commenting on an English subtitled Japanese release of the film. The dubbed English version Godzilla vs. The Thing which contains limited additional footage there is an American rocket strike on Godzilla is supposedly much better than previous efforts e.g. 1955's dire Gigantis the Fire Monster.";

It's a pretty cheesy thing but there is something endearing about the giant fluffy moth and its itsy bitsy fairy counterparts. Pitted against the original King of the Monsters this film represents one of the most original and most epic kaiju clashes.The film moves along briskly wasting little time to resurrect Godzilla and have him stomping on some buildings. The entire last half of the film is pretty much all mass destruction with plenty of buildings and towns getting whacked by the giant lizard's tail and crunched under its feet. When Mothra and its kin show up things get serious. Events leading up to the climactic battle cover just enough ground to set things up but hardly ever drags.The plot has been done before and is repeated in later films but in this film there's enough to the story to keep it interesting. Characters have their standout moments but are mostly flat and are pretty much forgotten by the final act. The story has some interesting conflicts running through it aside from the monstervsmonster action the film focuses a lot on corporate greed. Combined with the threat of nuclear supremacy represented by Godzilla and the sanctity of mother nature protected by Mothra the film underscores some key themes concerning unity and trust in the aftermath of the atomic age.This film boasts some really nice and colorful photography. Editing is decent with a few flashy transitions. Acting and writing are pretty decent. This production shows its age pretty badly with the model work and fakelooking monsters but most other sets props and costumes are really nice. Some of the matte paintings and composites are pretty decent too. Music is good.Mothra will reappear over and over again but the formula won't vary much the weird tiny fairy people will sing the giant moth appears flaps its wings to create a massive wind it drags Godzilla around by the tail then sheds some yellow stuff all over the place. It's a bit silly but I can't help but to adore the gargantuan insect and it's still pretty cool to see it in action in this oldschool monster flick. If you like either monster this film is certainly worth seeing and it remains a solid and perennial addition to the series.45 Entertainment Good  Story Pretty Good  Film Good".

The cast contribute admirably sincere performances with especially praiseworthy work by Akita Takarada as earnest newspaper reporter Ichiro Sakai Yuriko Hoshi as eager photographer Junko Nakanishi Hiroshi Kiozumi as the kindly Professor Miura and Yoshifumi Tajima as evil industrialist Kumayamu. Emi and Yumi Ito are absolutely adorable as the diminutive twin fairies. Akira Ifukube provides a robust and rousing score. Hajime Koizumi's crisp widescreen cinematography is likewise impressive. In addition we even get a strong but never too preachy antinuclear message and some funky Japanese mysticism. Highly recommended to fans of the Big G.".

Visually it is also quite good as it show of the landscapes and places in which the folklore of trolls actually arose and of course spices it with lovely computer graphics when needed. The graphics merge very well with the mockumentary style and the movie itself falls between categories mixing comedy action and fake amateur documentary style.The bad sides are simply that it lacks a bit of flow at times and of course the biggest drawback of them all one which only applies for foreigners it's a very very Norwegian story. I saw it with my Portuguese girlfriend and she thought it was okay. I briefed her on our fairy tales before seeing it but jokes like the three sheep on the bridge are hard to catch or appreciate without being marinated in our culture for a long time. One other issue for me was actually the cameo appearance of two Norwegian comedians something which slightly spoils the illusion. Others might disagree.I suspect this movie would be a seven or six of ten if I was not Norwegian simply for its concepts but because it is so rich to me I give it a ten despite its flaws. You'll love this movie for its visual side and some of the drama is also great. For Norwegians this is a must see. For everyone else it might be exotic and neat and offer you some relief from classical Hollywood monster depictions. And should you get curious after seeing it Google for Theodor Kittelsen and Asbjornsen and Moe  Enjoy!".

While the story is relatively tight it does not have the pretense as Sundance entries often do as it never takes itself too seriously. We ran into a couple of the film's producers the next day in Park City and found them to be as grounded as the film they were behind.I highly recommend this film and seriously hope it sees the light of day in the U.S.".

I have to admit that I am getting pretty sick of the usual movies. Recently I noticed that after watching thirty minutes in every movie good or bad I got bored. The reason is that I see always the same plot lines the same faces the same twists and I really don't care about them any more. If a movie does not have this effect on me its a sign that it is a special one. And this was the case of The Troll Hunter. The Troll Hunter is a really simple story its about a guy who hunts trolls in Norway and about a group of students who are filming him. This is where it gets interesting the movie is shot in the style of Blair Witch Cloverfield Rec Paranormal Activity etc. The handycam thing is one those things that makes the movie different. The second thing that got me in this movie was the quite unique Norwegian humor. I have not ran into it before but there are several moments that are really funny. Well its not hard to make funny moments when you make a movie about trolls that pretends to be serious. The third thing that was really good in this movie is the beautiful Norwegian nature there are many breath taking landscapes that I really want to see some day. The last there are many other thing that I liked in this movie was the old bearded guy the troll hunter. He was really cool. I mean he is hunting trolls all his life. OK so thats it go see this movie if you are bored with the usual ones.".

The trolls actually looked realistic though we all know they are fake. The realness actually pulled you into the movie. The movie really held tight to the myths behind trolls such as smelling Christians turning to stone and exploding with sunlight. Having it setup in a Blair Witch type with a first person camera angle made the movie all the more exciting. There was just enough camera shake to make you believe that the cameraman was running but not enough to make you sick. Allinall this was an excellent movie.

I could be wrong and I hope I'm wrong but I don't think I am.Nevertheless with that what we have here with The Troll Hunter is a story that starts with a trio of young college documentarians trying figure out why there are so many bear disappearances happening. Through Carmen Sandiegolike sleuthwork they come upon a Troll Hunter  and then the...hunt...is...on! Trolls are loose and it's now up to them to put an end to their trolly shenanigans! The film goes down the right paths and follows a rather formulaic storyline but with such a unique story leading the way you're more than happy to take the voyage through troll territory.The biggest and most satisfying aspect of this film for myself was that the film didn't shy away from any one area. A recent Scandanavian film that I won't name fartrareexportsfart  excuse me. That film brought you along and hoped to entice the viewer with emotion an early surprise and then male nudity  it didn't work and I was left stunned by the lackluster 'Fin'ished product. Here they talk about trolls and go off to hunt trolls so you'd think there would be trolls. And yep there are! And not only that they informed the viewer quite well about troll history and the different types. It was the type of love you hoped would be present here and I can't help to feel thankful for such research and creative thinking.Overall the actors and writing delivered a fine job as they juggled tongueincheek overacting with some scenes of serious drama. Basically every area of the film delivered to how you would want and I was totally content with how the fx and trolls all looked. It's one of the best found footage films around and if you enjoy fantasy in the slightest you should give this a look.My only real complaint here is how they could have neglected to put in the only troll that is still regularly found in modern days. I kept on asking myself 'Where the hell is the IMDb troll?' The stinkiest most pathetic troll to have ever lived is not put into the film? I suppose watching a troll whine to his or her mother about picking up the new and improved Oxy 5 zit medication or a bulk supply of super strength maxipads isn't really mustsee TV. It would have been nice to get a view into what their lairs must look like but I guess it would have taken away from the adventure aesthetic of this film. I suppose then it's up to me and you to stop the IMDb trolls. First things first if you see a hungry one restrain from feeding it. After you do that leave it to me. pulls on troll disemboweling gloves".

I kept on asking myself 'Where the hell is the IMDb troll?' The stinkiest most pathetic troll to have ever lived is not put into the film? I suppose watching a troll whine to his or her mother about picking up the new and improved Oxy 5 zit medication or a bulk supply of super strength maxipads isn't really mustsee TV. It would have been nice to get a view into what their lairs must look like but I guess it would have taken away from the adventure aesthetic of this film. I suppose then it's up to me and you to stop the IMDb trolls. First things first if you see a hungry one restrain from feeding it. After you do that leave it to me. pulls on troll disemboweling gloves";

	schema:reviewBody "I sincerely want to love Troll Hunter the latest in a batch of Scandinavian horror movies that have been shipped stateside. I want to love it for its tense cat and mouse moments I want to love it for its impressive ideas towards shaky cam cinematography and most of all I want to love it for the trolls themselves massive behemoths scouring the Norwegian countryside for a stray sheep or unsuspecting college student. Unfortunately Troll Hunter is a mixed bag that brings down the good with an abundance of the bad. The film starts out with a group of doeeyed college students who have been sent to investigate a recent influx of bear poaching perpetrated by a mysterious man with an initial aversion to cameras and a camper full of bizarre equipment. It doesn't take long for this shady character to reveal his mission to the students he is in fact a Trolljegeren a government hired Troll Hunter who ensures the illusive creatures existence is kept unknown by tracking down and killing any trolls that stray from their territorial boundaries. The students take this shocking revelation quite well and agree to follow the hunter as he tries to decipher the new found aggressiveness of trolls in the area.The plot is simple and passes up time that could be spent trying to establish logical character motivation in favor of lightly comic scenes and exposition regarding the biology and history of the trolls. This is not entirely a bad thing for most of the movie as director Andr vredal keeps things going smoothly pushing the audience from one impressive set piece to another. Many of the troll encounters are tense and breathtaking at the same time and one cannot help but marvel at the sight of a troll chasing our hapless heroes. This is largely due to the impressive low budget CGI used throughout the film and surprisingly smooth camerawork ditching the tiresome technique of flinging the camera left and right as one would most likely do in real life to be fair in favor of steady shots that allows the audience to marvel at the beasts without sacrificing the tension gained through shaky cam cinematography. The trolls themselves look amazing by far some of the most imaginative and well rendered budget movie magic I have seen in a long time especially coupled with the beautiful Norwegian scenery.Sadly despite all the praise I have heaped upon Troll Hunter the movie isn't without its flaws. The film falls flat on its face several times whether it is caused by overly bland exposition or painfully unfunny comedy that pops up throughout the film. These lulls aren't so bad in the first half but become incredibly agitating in the second as the viewer waits for a payoff that refuses to rear its ugly head. Also to note is the films general sloppiness in the final act in which multiple characters are introduced without purpose are never given an exit and don't fit at all within the story. Finally the film arrives at a conclusion that is incredibly odd as characters are dismissed without any closure to their arcs and events begin to happen that are head scratchingly misplaced. Although many of these gripes cripple what could have been one of the best scifi movies of the New Year Troll Hunter is still a fun but flawed ride with enjoyable scenes and some great visuals.".

This film is superior to others using that conceit in that the footage is supposedly being shot with professional equipment by aspiring professional videographers but there were still occasional jumbles and mumbles that I would have had to endure frustrated in a theater.It begins innocuously enuf with 3 student journalists from Volda University covering reports of bear poaching. Bear hunting is apparently strictly regulated in Norway and the licensed hunters are irritated that some unauthorized person has been horning in on their territory.

In fact he's the only licensed trolljegeren trollhunter in the entire country the sole field agent of the TSS Troll Security Service. Periodically after he's flashed a troll with powerful UV lights the lethal component of the sunlight which trolls invariably avoid and then sledgehammered its petrified remains into rubble it's necessary to come up with a cover story to explain all the damage the troll had done to the surrounding countryside. This is provided by scapebears killed and imported from far away Poland in the one scene our guys capture and left for the locals to gawk at.It takes some doing but Trolljegeren Hans Otto Jespersen finally opens up to the crew grumbling that his government handlers don't treat him with enuf dignity and respect let alone giving him adequate pay for overtime hazardous duty and night work. He explains that there are various subspecies of troll Ringlefinches Tosserlads Jotnars which inhabit different parts of the country and he can't figure out why this latest batch has wandered so far afield from their native stomping grounds.Eventually with the aid of a longtime veterinarian ally a PETA type who's sympathetic to the poor misunderstood Vitamin Ddeprived trolls he figures out that they've contracted rabies which explains their erratic behavior but also makes them much more dangerous.The trolls are always seen at night or in dark caves or at a distance so the CGI doesn't have to be very good to be convincing and their appearance is handled effectively. They are quite large the smallest easily standing 3 metres and the largest overtopping hightension power lines.The government of Norway is covering up the very existence of the trolls. We never learn why. Perhaps to avoid discouraging tourism? But I'd think public awareness of the trolls would have the reverse effect. Any idea that it's out of some benign desire to protect the native wildlife in its habitat is incommensurate with the demeanor of the Environment Ministry agent who keeps showing up periodically with ominous warnings to cease and desist.This whole story is played absolutely straight even tho there are times when a certain amount of levity seems warranted. It's kind of like MobyDick in that serious attention is paid to the gear and tactics of hunting the big elusive quarry.It's not a particularly compelling tale we never really get to know any of the characters and it tends to drag in spots but they do a fairly good job of spinning a yarn with a rockbottom budget. Generally things move along briskly unlike the other total dog of a DVD I saw the same night also a foreignlanguage film with subtitles Uncle Boonmee.It's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but you have to kind of admire their pluck.".

I saw the high rating of the movie so I started reading some reviews about it and they were 99 positive.In the end I downloaded it and watched it.Most of the reviews stated that the movie is funny. In contrast I thought that the movie is everything else but funny. It doesn't deliver humor in any way. As it was stated there are some inside Norwegian jokes which foreign people can not understand. For me  I couldn't understand any of the jokes.The actors tend to do a good job except the girl holding the microphone  she is just awful. As you probably have read the movie is filmed in a similar way as Cloverfield so that would mean that you have to expect acting off the radar. You should not be able to tell if the actors are acting .This is not the case whit the blond girl and the thing which was most irritating about her performance was the unusual facial expressions she made trough out the whole movie. There were some other cases which the acting seemed not natural but some of them were because of the script and not the actors. Speaking of which the script seemed very bizarre. I expected to see a humorous movie reviews if not an actiondrama as stated next to the title but in the end I got just an adventure movie also stated there. It takes in one way and ends up in to another.Unlike Cloverfield  you get to see the monster and in fact you get a lot of answers about the movie at the very beginning and as you move on  so this is a very different approach  which although new to me was a bit boring because there was nothing left to hang on in the end. The drama happening in the movie isn't that moving to keep you watching it and in fact it's not a big part of the movie .The characters are seriously undeveloped  so you basically don't care about them. There was some action at times but even the shaky camera couldn't intense me that much to say that it deserves to label it as an action movie. There were some other mistakes in the cameraeffects. The movie was represented as a documentary yet there is footage from other cameras except the one the characters hold in their hands. The night vision effect seemed unreal because it wasn't. You can clearly see at times that there are really dark spots when they turn it on  and others are really light  even though there is no light turned on in some of the scenes. There are a couple of other mistakes as well but I do not want to get in to detail.Finally the movie delivered a great representation of Norwegian landscape. I was thrilled by the footage I saw and how beautiful it is there. It just feels like an Adventure movieif I have to label a genre to it.Don't expect massive goreactiondrama or humor. Many Norwegians liked the film but I didn't know what to expect a disaster movie or a great movie. In the end I didn't get either. I got a different movie which wasn't a masterpiece. Although it had a bunch of flaws and it's not that interesting to watchIt's worth checking out and I do not regret doing so but keep in mind that if you are not from Norway you could have some trouble with it and it's representation reviewsrating and so on.".

	schema:reviewBody "I seriously don't really understand the high amount of positive critics concerning this movie. I bought this flick because I heard that the makers of the highly entertaining zombie parody Dead Snow were included in this project. This film though doesn't come close to it concerning the story the characters and even the special effects.First of all the characters have almost no development and you don't feel attached to them at all. You don't care if they live or die and the whole movie leaves you emotionally cold.Second the shaky hand camera filming techniques that are justified by a socalled documentary style as in The Blair Witch Project don't only happen to be used too much in modern cinema. They are also just a very cheap way to put less money and also less effort into this movie.Third the CGI animated special effects are really cheap and not impressive at all. If this movie is supposed to have a minimum of suspense then the bad shapes of the trolls just crush this intention. On the other side the effects are also not ridiculous or original enough to make you laugh at least. They are just boringly unprofessional and feel worked out in quite a hurry.This low budget disappointment is crowned by a stupid ending as if the production team was running out of ideas or out of money or maybe out of both of it. This bad conclusion definitely isn't worth your patience to sit through this mediocre effort. This movie is definitely lacking of any highlights whatsoever.The only reasons why I still gave a few points to this are first of all the breathtaking Norwegian landscapes that make you want to go there and discover this beautiful country. Second there are after all a couple of good jokes that mostly come from the troll hunter who happens to be the only character that stands out a tiny little bit even if he is already filled with too many stereotypes. The third and last small positive point is the connection to Norwegian culture and mythology in this movie featuring a couple of explanations in regard to the world of trolls.".

	onyx:emotionText "I seriously don't really understand the high amount of positive critics concerning this movie. I bought this flick because I heard that the makers of the highly entertaining zombie parody Dead Snow were included in this project. This film though doesn't come close to it concerning the story the characters and even the special effects.First of all the characters have almost no development and you don't feel attached to them at all. You don't care if they live or die and the whole movie leaves you emotionally cold.Second the shaky hand camera filming techniques that are justified by a socalled documentary style as in The Blair Witch Project don't only happen to be used too much in modern cinema. They are also just a very cheap way to put less money and also less effort into this movie.Third the CGI animated special effects are really cheap and not impressive at all. If this movie is supposed to have a minimum of suspense then the bad shapes of the trolls just crush this intention. On the other side the effects are also not ridiculous or original enough to make you laugh at least. They are just boringly unprofessional and feel worked out in quite a hurry.This low budget disappointment is crowned by a stupid ending as if the production team was running out of ideas or out of money or maybe out of both of it. This bad conclusion definitely isn't worth your patience to sit through this mediocre effort. This movie is definitely lacking of any highlights whatsoever.The only reasons why I still gave a few points to this are first of all the breathtaking Norwegian landscapes that make you want to go there and discover this beautiful country. Second there are after all a couple of good jokes that mostly come from the troll hunter who happens to be the only character that stands out a tiny little bit even if he is already filled with too many stereotypes. The third and last small positive point is the connection to Norwegian culture and mythology in this movie featuring a couple of explanations in regard to the world of trolls.";

But after to much you get no feeling that belongs to good movie...So whats giving the movie 4 stars?The Camera is good! If I compare this with Cloverfield same genre it is much more sightly and that get's high points. The Main Character Hans the Trollhunter is a very good actor and the only one who stay in the role. He rates the Movie higher. The story board itself is matured so you get what the wanted to show you. With the Locations they did also everything right.Now the fact that Trolls doesn't exist they have to do CGI Elements. And for me they tried to make good Trolls. But the fact that this Things are that big that many that simple and dumb... Evolution had already outsourced this species in my opinion. So it would be never a fact that the government made such a big deal out of it.If this movie would be made by students in real live I would totally give them 3 Bonus Stars.So overall the one question is left Would I recommend it? I'm sorry... but no. I cannot say it entertained me or made me philosophize about Trolls. And if you want to watch a movie in your free time this one is not one you should waste your time with.".

	schema:reviewBody "First let me say that I did NOT watch the film with subtitles but dubbed.The film gets a few stars for showing pretty nicely designed trolls that are  from what I've read  pretty accurate to old Norwegian folklore. This is actually a pretty nice idea but unfortunately the film doesn't make much of it because it is one giant plot hole in itself. The entire film doesn't make the least bit of sense they just found some stupid reasons to show off trolls and that's it.So let's get started... . A group of students wants to do a documentary about some guy named Hans who is supposed to be a bear poacher what an excellent excuse for another mockumentary. And as it seems students have a very hard time holding the camera straight for more than two seconds even when doing interviews. So anyway they find Hans and stalk him for a whole day until at night they follow him to the woods where they see some flickering light and then Hans comes running at them screaming Troll!. Freeze frame here for a second This was the first time I really had to laugh at how stupid the movie was because Hans runs until he is about half a feet in front of the children then stands still screams TROLL! and runs off in some camouflage suit. This could have been a slapstick scene actually. The acting of all main characters was pretty bad until that point but that scene carried it a little too far and actually made me cry in tears from laughter. Anyway let's carry on. They flee one of the students Thomas gets bitten guess that's going to be a problem huh? but they get away. Hans admits that he is a troll hunter and agrees for the students to go with him. The next day they go troll hunting find a troll make him into stone with a giant ultraviolet lamp and crush him. I have to say the trolls actually were pretty nice. They were well designed and animated and I liked them a lot. This was destroyed though by Hans telling the kids that the trolls can smell a Christian's blood and that if any of them believed in Jesus they couldn't come. Let's remind ourselves that this is a mockumentary that starts with the words A team of experts examined the tapes for a whole year and came to the conclusion that they must be true. Seriously? And you give me they smell a Christian's blood? Wow. So after they kill the troll Hans reveals that he is actually working for a super secret government agency that makes sure nobody finds out that there actually are trolls. No one of them ever asks WHY they want to keep that a secret. I mean there is no agency to keep elephants a secret is there? So why trolls? Hans then continues to say that he wants the students to film his troll hunting because he gets payed badly and wants the world to know that trolls exist in order to change something. But... if everyone knew about the trolls there would be no more need for his super secret government agency which pays him badly and doesn't even give him  and I quote here  extra pay for night work would it? Well he probably could still protect humans from trolls so he might not lose his job. Who knows. Anyway this one guy decides to blow the entire super secret agency and give it all away. Best part is when another guy from the agency arrives the bureaucrat and lays out some fake bear traces to cover up the troll genius! too bad he switched the left and right fake bear foot which later confuses some hunting experts who examine the bear tracks. He tells the students that he would not let them film their super secret work and then JUST DRIVES OFF and leaves the student with the camera and the tape. What? Wait a second ... what if they make a copy of the tape? Or simply just go away and publish it? Well I'm having the feeling I'm starting to rant here so I'll make the rest of the review quick. I guess you got an impression why I said this film is a giant plot hole. The rest of the film is about them hunting trolls with Hans and finding out something about a troll disease which makes them leave their territories but this really is of no interest to the viewer because by then you don't believe a single thing happening there and are not sucked into the movie at all because this all is so badly written and acted. I'm not giving away the ending here but it's pretty lame subjective opinion! and weird and makes no sense objective opinion!.In the end I had a few good laughs and was not completely bored but the film really suffered from it's badly executed mockumentary style. Doing a mockumentary means doing something half believable. Plot holes and bad acting this film has both! are even worse in a mockumentary because it makes the whole thing unbelievable and detaches you from the movie. This might have been more decent if it wasn't done as a mockumentary I can't say for sure. But the way it is done now is definitely the wrong way.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is one of the strangest experiences of a movie I have seen in a while not quite sure if it was trying to be funny at times or being serious. The film is all about a small film crew from a university who are trying to track a bear with some hunters. They then see a hunter who seems to be not registered to hunt bears and so they believe he is illegally trying to find it himself but things are not as they seem. We then get introduced to the world of Trolls and what it consists of the types of trolls where they live and how they are dealt with. The plot becomes thrilling at times and by the end it leaves you guessing what will happen next with its odd blend of humour to boot the movie is firmly a good one.The movie features a relatively unknown cast except maybe the comedian Otto Jespersen who to be fair will probably be only known to people in Norway. The cast being unknown works though because it gives the movie a more real feel to it and the footage actually looks like a bunch of amateurs filming it too. The characters are not the best people I felt if you like to connect with the people in a movie but nevertheless they can be funny and it is always good to see their reactions.Andre vredal directs and writes this and it is he who really takes this to a good level he seems to direct in a way which is the basis for that humour I have mentioned and blends it well with all the things going on in this. He writes it pretty well too and yet again it feels humorous the script there are times when the script can go a little over the top but it remains all well throughout. Toward the end I did feel the movie starts to actually eclipse it's documentary style and looks like an actual movie more with this the success comes from it looking real so it's good that only the end looks a little too un real.With the kind of budget this has you can't expect the trolls to look like they have come from a Hollywood blockbuster but what happens in this is pretty nicely done. The Trolls are usually seen either from far away or in the dark meaning even if the quality of the effects don't look 100 great you still don't see the detail too much which could have ruined the believable look surrounding this. The movie also excels in creating the troll world it has it's details all mapped out and never just goes straight for it in fact some of the most interesting moments come from when the characters are simply sitting round discussing Trolls.Overall Troll Hunter is a fine movie and one I would definitely recommend you watch it's mix of horror with comedy and of course Trolls makes this a unique watch and in regards to it's documentary style as well. The ending isn't one I personally liked so much but who cares the substance inbetween is enough anyway to make it likable. Look out some of the jokes in this can seem like legit serious lines but really are satirical in nature this film also employs things like the Christian thing watch it and you'll see what I mean it's a weirdly funny addition.".

	schema:headline " Near perfection in its genre";
	schema:reviewBody "The Troll Hunter is a 2010 documentary style film detailing the exploits of Norway's sole troll hunter and a crew of university film makers. The goal of this movie is to present the audience with a comedic adventure about hunting mythical creatures. While this film is most easily compared to The Blair Witch Project it provides a much more exciting viewing experience and avoids some of the obnoxious sequences that BWP suffered from. A very important thing to understand is that this film does not push new frontiers rather it utilizes a cinematic device to near perfection.From the opening scenes TH announces itself as a presentation of actual footage. The audience is immediately instructed to interpret this film as an edited series of real events and not a rollicking adventure story. Having this context in place makes several necessary assumptions easier to accept. First the viewer is challenged to believe that a secret government agency and its troll hunting actions would be allowed to be filmed. Second it appears that large humanoid trolls are able to live in sparsely populated Norwegian areas and never be detected. Under any other context these conditions are ridiculous at the very least. Yet in this film one is happy to completely suspend disbelief and join in on a cryptozoological safari. Why? The idea is sheer fun. This film has chosen the perfect creature in that it requires no real supernatural belief and it is just underexposed enough to grab hold of general interest. One note of clarification is useful here. Apparently trolls are culturally more discussed in Norway. As such some of the troll humor and lore may not be as accessible to a foreign audience as a Norwegian one. That said as a nonNorwegian I was still able to greatly enjoy this film.One of the biggest complaints that this film may suffer from is the roving camera style of shooting. Just as scenes in Blair Witch were at times disorienting or nauseating Troll Hunter suffers from some shaky camera work. Even though this aspect could be held as a fault it is completely in keeping with the agenda of the film makers. Troll Hunter as a production is completely aware of its own absurdity. As such the goal seems to be to present the absurd and humorous in the most dead pan and realistic way possible. As an example there are beautiful shots of icy fields interspersed with high voltage power lines. Instead of saying anything about power transport these wires are explained as secret troll fences. Making such an odd and unbelievable assertion without even a hint of cracking a smile is a near perfect example of how a mockumentary can credibly over stretch credulity. In addition to the overall mood of the film the pacing is excellent. This is not a movie where the audience is forced to wait over an hour for an unexpected payoff. On the contrary with a minimal set up the film begins to deliver tense action sequences and then fills in details around them. The effect is that this mockumentary builds as it is viewed as opposed to fizzling in its own story. Overall this is a film that can be enjoyed by near all audiences albeit Norwegians may take more away in the humor department but only slightly. This film has taken the adventurehorror mockumentary and brought it to almost perfection.On a personal note I will be recommending this film to friends. While it does require some attention to detail and story this is very good beer and pizza fare. 7.5 Stars.".

A very important thing to understand is that this film does not push new frontiers rather it utilizes a cinematic device to near perfection.From the opening scenes TH announces itself as a presentation of actual footage. The audience is immediately instructed to interpret this film as an edited series of real events and not a rollicking adventure story. Having this context in place makes several necessary assumptions easier to accept. First the viewer is challenged to believe that a secret government agency and its troll hunting actions would be allowed to be filmed. Second it appears that large humanoid trolls are able to live in sparsely populated Norwegian areas and never be detected. Under any other context these conditions are ridiculous at the very least. Yet in this film one is happy to completely suspend disbelief and join in on a cryptozoological safari. Why? The idea is sheer fun. This film has chosen the perfect creature in that it requires no real supernatural belief and it is just underexposed enough to grab hold of general interest. One note of clarification is useful here. Apparently trolls are culturally more discussed in Norway. As such some of the troll humor and lore may not be as accessible to a foreign audience as a Norwegian one. That said as a nonNorwegian I was still able to greatly enjoy this film.One of the biggest complaints that this film may suffer from is the roving camera style of shooting. Just as scenes in Blair Witch were at times disorienting or nauseating Troll Hunter suffers from some shaky camera work. Even though this aspect could be held as a fault it is completely in keeping with the agenda of the film makers. Troll Hunter as a production is completely aware of its own absurdity. As such the goal seems to be to present the absurd and humorous in the most dead pan and realistic way possible. As an example there are beautiful shots of icy fields interspersed with high voltage power lines. Instead of saying anything about power transport these wires are explained as secret troll fences. Making such an odd and unbelievable assertion without even a hint of cracking a smile is a near perfect example of how a mockumentary can credibly over stretch credulity. In addition to the overall mood of the film the pacing is excellent. This is not a movie where the audience is forced to wait over an hour for an unexpected payoff. On the contrary with a minimal set up the film begins to deliver tense action sequences and then fills in details around them. The effect is that this mockumentary builds as it is viewed as opposed to fizzling in its own story. Overall this is a film that can be enjoyed by near all audiences albeit Norwegians may take more away in the humor department but only slightly. This film has taken the adventurehorror mockumentary and brought it to almost perfection.On a personal note I will be recommending this film to friends. While it does require some attention to detail and story this is very good beer and pizza fare. 7.5 Stars.";

It delivered in several waysIt has the expected action stunts effects.It has the expected oneliners and humor.Acting is generally perfectly adequate for the purpose. Rather it must be pretty good when I never was disturbed by any bad acting.It is nicely futuristic in a nearfuture fashion with many perfectly or partially believable ideas and some that we don't quite believe in but hey if we accept hyperspace travel then we can accept this.It has a message that actually keeps us thinking after leaving the movie. The cloning problem is considered from many points of view not only as the bad guy's evil plan. How far can we heal how far can we preserve life when does it become an ethical problem when will it clash with religion?That is quite impressive if you ask me.However sometimes it fails on two points Predictability and suspense. Some scenes especially involving the bad guy are so embarrassingly predictable that it makes me wish they could have skipped some clichs just for once. And the movie misses great suspense opportunities on several occasions. I won't tell you how who or when but when a guy is assassinated it should not happen just out of the blue but we should be led into the situation slowly for example from the assassin's point of view so we get the chance to worry about it. That opportunity is missed at least twice when the movie jumps straight into the kill giving us momentary cheap shock instead of thrill. Compare it to the killing in for example Predator one of the most excellent Arnold movies. Most kills by the Predator don't come out of the blue we are warned and it adds suspense and thrill.Those flaws push the movie down from the top marks but I still rank it pretty high for the points mentioned above. Quite entertaining and even interesting too which makes it one of the better Arnold movies. Recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently had the pleasure of teaching the wonders of film criticism to an English composition class at Marietta College in Marietta Ohio. The experience was enjoyable and the class posed a number of questions. One of the more interesting questions concerned the films I had seen that I believed had potential but ultimately failed in execution. While I have seen a number of films that fit into this category I couldn't think of a decent example. This was because I hadn't seen The 6th Day yet. What could have been an interesting and exciting look at the evils of cloning was a B grade action film at best despite an abovepar script and one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's better roles to date.The film's premise is heavily based in TRUE science fiction that is fiction having its basis in scientific truth using projections of the future to fully examine some aspect of our society. Sorry to go into such an elaborate definition but I believe a lot of stuff gets swept into the category of science fiction simply because it has a robot or takes place in outer space. But I digress.This fictional reality here deals with cloning. In the film which takes place in the near future cloning is an everyday practice but only with pets and animals. Cloning people has been outlawed as the original human cloning project went horribly wrong. Schwarzenegger plays Adam Gibson a decent family man and helicopter pilot chartered to fly Michael Drucker Tony Goldwyn a rich businessman who owns Replacement Technologies. This corporation is at the height of cloning technology running everything from a fish cloning company to help repopulate the oceans to RePet a company that clones dead family pets. There's even a rumor that the company's head doctor Robert Duvall is experimenting with illegal human cloning. Something goes terribly wrong on Drucker's first flight and before he knows Gibson discovers he has been cloned. Its up to him to discover the secret controversy and get his life back.With this premise the film is wide open to make many social observations and does so very well on occasion. Much of the legalities concerning cloning as well as the ethical concerns are discussed and examined by the characters. Even though the technology exists in the future it is not widely accepted. Some of these observations are stated with all the eloquence you could expect from an Arnoldaction film but others are done so subtly and surprisingly with biting humor. Much of the concept of RePet is quite amusing.However if science fiction is the film's basis lame action sequences are its filler. In between these intriguing dialogues are shoddy cookiecutter action scenes one should expect from a made for TV film. No matter if it's a car chase a laser gun shootout or a helicopter battle it all feels very dull. It's not that I'm knocking these things because they have to appear in action film I just wish they were done well. Ultimately the action suffers from a lack of creativity which ironically is where the rest of the script excels.And one can't blame Arnold for not trying as he is both charming and believable in his part. His is a performance with a surprising level of humanity especially in scenes where he's going about his daily life. One almost forgets he's an action star and begins to take him a little seriously. But don't worry after the first halfhour he's picked up a laser gun and is fighting and onelining his way to the climax.I guess my one qualm with The 6th Day is its failed potential with some better action sequences like those found in The Matrix this could have been a very decent film one I would be sending you to right away. Instead it's simply a waitforvideo flick and by my guess that wait won't be long.".

From Robert Duvall who played the doctor who performed the cloning operations to Michael Rooker who was one evil henchmen with his menacing attitude and presence The 6th Day is one great film to see.I enjoyed how the plot of film didn't rely solely on the action sequences. Though the action is fine and dandy I believe that a film needs more than just action and The 6th Day has it.The 6th Day is one of the best Arnold films I've seen including the Terminator series. It is filled with action twists turns edge of your seat suspense and drama that will appeal to all movie fans of every age.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE 6TH DAY  2000  out of four By Blake FrenchRoger Spottiswoode's recent action film The 6th Day is of the best thrillers you will see this year and possibly the next. Seldom do action pictures have as much thought insight and are this well written and developed. With a screenplay by Cormac Wibberley and Marianne Wibberley the movie takes one of the most controversial current subjects cloning and applies it to a time when it may cause discern for public the near future. This is a movie with ample prominence and proximity and depending where you stand on the issue of cloning will determine whether or not we will side with the main character here. He is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger now forgiven for his last several bombs Jingle all the Way End of Days and Batman and Robin. If one thriller can make up for those three hideous productions you know it must be very good...and it is.Schwarzenegger stars as Adam Gibson a middleaged everyman who has a lovely wife Natalie Wendy Crewson and a young pretty daughter named Carla Taylor Anne Reid. Adam and his friend Hank Michael Rapaport are pilots for the Double X Charter Company a helicopter touring service. While most of society has adapted to the advancements in technology such as the ability to clone deceased pets and to own a realistic looking and behaving doll Adam is pretty oldfashioned when it comes branch of knowledge. At least until one night when he returns home to find his family and friends celebrating his birthday with him already inside. Outside his house waits several agents including Talia Sarah Wynter Robert Michael Rooker and Vincent Terry Crews who attempt to kill him. Adam and Hank were cloned by a multibillion dollar food cloning company Replacement Technologies. This corporation is run by an individual named Drucker Tony Goldwyn who supposedly used his cloning equipment to replenish the world's food supply. While human cloning is illegal he and his chief scientist Dr. Weir Robert DuVall are constantly cloning for various reasons. After they discover Adam escaped his assassins they begin an all out scheme to destroy the evidence in which they have created. The tedious measures the filmmakers take in development of the characters situations events and motives are outstanding. We get to know the main characters. They are intriguing and the conflict is highly engrossing even the antagonist's motives provoke thought. The film is engaging throughout because the subject and its execution are so relevant and controversial. The 6th Day does not feel like a high tech action film although it is. But it also has a very authentic flavor because it uses the special effects to further the story and the action sequences are all in context of the plot. About those action scenes and special effects they do not distract from the movie's themes or story. Roger Spottiswoode whose most poplar work consists of  Tomorrow Never Dies 1997 and Turner  Hooch 1989 keeps the story fastpaced but finely focused. The futuristic material so often overused in movies nowadays is kept to a believable realm here. The film handles the material with delicacy if the movie was to use too little its subject matter would be unconvincing if there was too much then the film would become too farfetched. Spottiswoode contrasts just the right amount and blends the effects with the various character's personalities beautifully. What impresses me most of all about movies like The 6th Day is how the writers deny the urge to allow the special effects and action to take place of the passion in characters. In the year 2000 we received big waves in The Perfect Storm big explosions in U571 computer animated sequences in XMen and all sorts of special martial arts stunts in Charlie's Angels and Legend of Drunken Master. But what those movies were missing is depth and insight of the real world and the movies that did contain heart like The Perfect Storm were contrived and shameless. With The 6th Day we have a movie that contains all the excitement and special effects but within a story that is characterbased and relevant to our times. This is one of the top ten movies released in the year 2000.".

	schema:reviewBody "That film is not a masterpiece for sure even as an action film. But this film goes along with many films with Schwarzenegger that are dealing with the future. We of course think at once of Terminator. But it also deals with another theme that is popular with him the use of technology and science to enslave humanity I mean true real human beings. At times this technology and science is coming from outer space like in Predator. In this case like in Total Recall or The Running Man it is coming from humans themselves. In this case it goes slightly further than in other cases. We are not speaking of robots of the misuse of television and so on but we are speaking of cloning. What happens when the inventor of a new technology that enables the cloning of a man in twenty minutes including his mind memories etc by the recording of all that via an eye scanner is using the technology to reproduce himself and his associates? What happens if that inventor is able to inject into each clone a fatal disease that limits his life span to five years maximum and only the very few at the heart of the plot would be free of that fatal gene or could be cloned again without it? The story of course does not answer these questions really because Adam Gibson a good old name for the one who will regenerate the creation of God the creation of the first Adam on the sixth day of his work selfappoints himself as the one who is going to clean up the plate and he does. The details are in the film. The film adds on this plate the fact that Adam Gibson had been by mistake cloned and then two Adam Gibsons have to cooperate and to survive together a good lesson of humanity for which the family is the inalienable unit that any man in this family has to defend. Slightly mancentered but that is no real accident. The man portrayed here is slightly oldfashioned. That's why he is against cloning and that's why he is a slight but gallant male chauvinist. Just watch the film for the action and do not compare with memories of yours.

	schema:reviewBody "In the near future cloning technology is highly developed and the corporation Replacement Technologies owned by the wealthy Michael Drucker Tony Goldwyn is responsible for cloning pets in RePet shops. However there is a law called Sixth Day that prohibits human cloning and many groups and movements that are against any type of cloning. When Drucker needs to travel to a remote location he hires the professional helicopter pilots Adam Gibson Arnold Schwarzenegger and his friend Hank Morgan Michael Rapaport requesting an eye test from them first. However Hamk flies since it is Adam's birthday the family dog has just died and he is thinking about the possibility of cloning the animal for his daughter. Adam decides to by a doll called Cindy instead but when he arrives home he finds that Oliver and he have been cloned. Further he is hunted down by four professional killers and he needs to flee. What happened to Adam and why was he cloned?The 6th Day is a thoughtful and full of action scifi from the beginning of this century.

	schema:reviewBody "The great things about this film are the high energy action sequences with an aging and only slightly unbelievable Arnold Schwarzenneggar. What is far from great however is how the film does a halfassed job of dealing with an ethical issue in what ought to have been a thoughtful way. The film treats the issue of cloning in an amazingly misinformed and ignorant manner and rides on a remarkably idiotic script.Don't people consult with realworld scientists when treating scientific issues any more? Assuming Western civilization survives into the 22nd century people will likely look at this propaganda film as an example of the savagery of 21st century life inhabiting the same cinematic context that Reefer Madness enjoys today.It is clear that a lot of thought went into this film. However thought without the support of FACT is about as useful as a teabag without water. Thought is a means to great things those great things can not come to fruition without a proper context and without the support offered by... reality.Arnold who is really the only personality in the film gets illegally cloned for no apparent reason the plot is not driven by necessity but rather by the writers poor conceptualization of the moral implications of cloning and his clone not being aware of the fact that he is a clone takes over the REAL Arnold's life. A lot of people in fact get cloned for no apparent reason and then get shot for equally inconsequential reasons. I will not spoil this by going much farther but I have to admit that the ending is WORTH the effort of suspending disbelief through all the absurdity of the first 34ths and is the reason I gave the film a 4 instead of a 1. Politically most of the movie is a 1 This is NOT a film about the REALITY of cloning. Rather it is a paranoid empty and weightless attack on the whole moral concept of cloning  and by implication an attack om science and medical progress. Science does not and can not progress by weak cowardly halfmeasure conservatism. If this were its mode of operation we would still be treating communicable diseases with mercury injections and sweat baths as we were just a hundred years ago. We are constantly beaten over the head by movies like this  with the message of science's potential to destroy all we hold dear. Folks your politicians invented the HBomb not the scientists in the Manhattan Project and certainly not Einstein upon whose work its technology relies. And worse... the politicians were also the ones who used it.One of the questions the film treats  seriously  is whether or not clones have souls. Getting past the fact that souls are not definable through any rational thought process and really have no place in movies concerning scientific themes clones being more or less exact genetic copies of existing organisms have as much soul as any other creature. How could it be otherwise? Fortunately this film does not provide a clear message in the end despite the heavyhanded futurephobic paranoiac ultrarightwing ignorance pervading the first half of the film. Worth watching if you can stomach the stupidity to get to the rather ambiguous but reasonable point.".

The story is not much to write home about but that needn't have made 6th Day such a disappointing film. The abject lack of Arnie's usual heavy violence makes this sorry viewing for fans of his earlier movies. Arnie's scenes with his family are utterly vomit inducing such are their insincerity. Robert Duvall is OK in this but he is never stretched. The rest of the cast are typical Bmovie fodder not terrible but hardly reinventing the wheel either! 6th Day will not be fondly remembered but will probably keep turning up on Channel 5 for years to come. It's harmless enough but not particularly fun to watch. Best to catch it when nothing else is on.".

And with muted sucess the Sixth Day Arnold returns to a movie which has more thought and brains than any of his past two or three films.However it doesn't fit well into what should be an allout action fest and it doesn't fit with the direction style.Set in the near future Arnold or Ahnuld is a future helicopter pilot  and wakes up one day to find himself looking at himself  a doppleganger effect if ever there was one. He finds out he has been cloned.At this point I have expected Arnold to go beserk ref Rainer Wolfcastle Simpsons  but instead we get Arnold walking around trying to discover the truth behind the evil cooperation behind his cloning in a sort of well I dunno if I want this to be all out action but I want it to be intelligent as well kind of manner.This isn't helped but the direction which goes into pseduoTony Scott style mixed with Matrix trickery. Thankfully there is enough darkness in the film with subtle references to Blade Runner and Paul Verhoven's work throughout the film that it doesn't get annoying.Unfortuently the Matrix trickery does get a little annoying especally when you get overhead shots of the same freeway with cars going at fast speeds  and Arnold's memory going into worbly effect for no reason. I know its his memory there's no need for it to be worbly.There is also the flipbook effect at the end of the movie where you see the whole movie in reverse in doublespeed which ends with a part where you seem to think your a clone as well  and this is your memory...it was a nice effect and a nice twist.The film treds lightly on the subject of cloning and although you know the film is dead against it it does try to debate why it might be useful. The empty vessels in the underground lab of the evil corp. seem to be there to scare the uneducated  it takes years to get full humans even cloning would not get you an exact copy of a person.The plot gets around this by using simcording's of a person's memory  this technology in itself is far more frightening than any cloning technology.The evil guy uses clones for his own selfish reasons  to make money  clones have faults in them so they die every so many years  hence happy customers will pay him billions just to stay alive.Again this is where the film misses the mark. Perhaps if someone else had starred in this film I could believe an evil guy just wants to make money  but this is an arnold film  I wanted the evil guy to clone the presidents of the world  take over the world or at least something that would hark back to the action that we as audiences have expected from Schwarznegger.Later on in the film Arnold seems to constantly pat himself on the back when he meets up with his clone  it is incredibly hammy  and for some reason I kept thinking Arnold had ventured into Jean Claude Van Damme egoterrotory.Anyway the film lacks from a real edge. It might have twice the Ahnuld but it certainly doesn't have twice the action.Perhaps a good rental but I certainly wouldn't buy it.Overall 410".

Arnold is know for kicking ass in big budget movies and this is just what he does here. Nothing more. The plot is a lame and uninspired version of Total Recall and it tries to top it with almost hilarious futility. There is even a scene where Arnold wakes up in a cab with no recollection of how he got there. Sound familiar? It should since you have probably seen that in a better movie.Now one can't blame this all on Arnold since the producers are likely to be just as much at fault. Take one of the opening sequences that involves two admitted cool helicopterjet hybrids racing in a canyon with one on remote control and the other actually being flown by a pilot. It's a fun scene but it offers nothing more than fancy special effects. I don't mind expansive special effects but there is a clear difference when these effects are thoughtful and designed with purpose than when they are not. The expansive and expensive sets and effects of Total Recall all worked within the film to show you the futuristic world that the story takes place in. Here many things are shown off just because they look cool and the overall scifi world isn't really a scifi world at all. It is just our contemporary world with random scifi things thrown in like holograms hightech vehicles and gadgets. Though in a very odd move one of the film's main action scenes a car chase has just regular cars and a regular suburban setting. The only indicator of science fiction is that these vehicles are virtually indestructible as they plow through houses and take vehicle suspensions to new levels of abuse. However in the end it just the same old thing reheated reglossed and reserved on the same old movie screen.In other words wholly uninteresting science fictionaction movie that barely scratches the surface of its interesting premise. It'll only entertain if taken as a nobrainer action flick but there are so many of those around anyway.  410Rated PG13 for violence. This is a real MPAA treat as we are treated to lasers severing body parts and neck breaking. A real high for violence in the PG13 category. Ages 13".

But beneath the horrid effects and poor script this movie raises important questions about human cloning and gives VERY good reasons as to why it should NEVER happen.We all know the plot by now. Arnie comes home from work only to find that he's already there and celebrating his own birthday. What a high concept idea! But the execution of it and the bad script turn it into a shambles.The action is badly done and the SFX are pathetic. I usually don't care much for SFX but I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie. Those helicopters that can turn into jet planes are soooooo tacky.Many of us doubted Arnie after Batman and Robin and End of Days I was one of them but he has proved himself here once again as an action hero who can still be the lead in a movie even if it still a crap one. Age has not slowed him down and it doesn't look like it will for a while yet. He has still got a few more action movies to go. Maybe one day we'll get a third Terminator.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was pushed as a dissertation on the ethical issues and social implications of cloning in the world of the near future and most viewers seem to have interpreted it as just that.  But the truth of the matter is the aspect of human cloning isn't really the crux of this film at all it's the 'syncorder' technology.  Theoretically we could clone a human being now but such a process would be a threat to no one we'd simply have a totally seperate individual with the same DNA the individual from whom heshe was cloned.  The ability to 'synchord' peoples memories and personalities and implant them into the clone however allows the films villains to insidiously 'replace' their victims.  Well if you have a bloody syncorder to hell with cloning!  These people could already conquer the world by retrieving classified secrets from people to whom they give 'retinal scans!'  Also the existence of the syncorder implies that the information storage and retrieval systems of the human brain have been cracked.  If that were the case wouldn't people be able to build more advanced computer programs than the mindless repetitive dolllike imitations of SimPal Cindy and the Virtual Girlfriend?The fact is this world is not one of the 'near future' because the kind of technology required to build a synchorder let alone one as small and easy to use as the 'vision testing machine' used by this film's villainry is not going to be available to use for a long looong time.  Since the characters ignore this and focus almost entirely on the mundane concept of cloning most of the important questions are not asked.  Arnold's clone wonders if he is human.  Well of course he's human!  And the idea that he doesn't have a soul simply because he is a clone is repulsive how about not having a soul because his memories and personality emanate from a digital information storage device?Barring this I think that this was a good action flick embedded in a surprisingly well done science fiction film.  Innovative direction if not choreography and the movie puts a lot of things taken for granted from Arnie's previous action films on their heads which is fun to watch. Having to kill the same people over and over Yeah yeah we've all been killed before. and two Arnies arguing with each other and double teaming the bad guys for example.  My only problem Arnold is some kind of extreme sports chartered helicopter pilot how does that explain his trademark aim paramilitary training and the ability to effortlessly kill people with his bare hands?  We know he HAS to be able to do these things but it still makes no sense in this case.".

It moves right along because there is no wasted motion as there is in most other action pictures.This does not mean there is no action there is fabulous action but only such action as is necessary to move the plot along. There is no action simply to occupy time until the requisite 90 minutes are up.The directing is equally economical. No fancy shots shaky cameras or special effects  just good straight forward directing.I doubt this picture could be made today for the above reasons. The script readers would reject it for 'lack of development' 'not enough action' 'no romantic interest' and all the other brainless formulas script readers dole out. The producers would demand 'more action' and 'camera work' from the directors.

He was backed up by a mafia reject the crazed and unpredictable Mr. Gray who couldn't wait to show who was boss and was keen to rack up a body count or as he put it get on the scoreboard! He didn't like to take orders and it took a lot to keep him in line. There was Mr. Brown and lastly Mr Blue who was a former transit employee who held a grudge against the authority and wasn't satisfied with his pension.Lieutenant Garber was the head of the transit security played by Walter Matthau who found himself the unfortunate go between or negotiator during the hostage stage. His New York dialect and humor was a great contrast to the methodical leader of the gang with the English accent who took himself very seriously and was prepared to kill anybody at any time in cold blood. Admittedly this type of negotiation would be ridiculous today he wasn't even in anyway qualified to negotiate with the hijackers. Also Garber not only had deal with Mr. Green but also found himself up against one of the head dispatchers who couldn't care less about the predicament of the hijacked passengers but was more concerned about getting his trains running on time. This approach would not cut it today 30 years on hostage taking requires a more professional approach. However he does his best and on a couple of occasions his quick thinking is able to save the lives of some the hostages.Anyway the crooks only wanted money there was no political reason but were highly motivated very well organized and determined. This was understood very quickly when one of the subway station managers Caz Dolowicz or known as fat Caz took exception to these upstarts and decided berate the hijackers and board the train. Just to prove that the hijackers meant business they gave him a 'lead breakfast' and he was ripped apart by the hail of bullets discharged from an automatic weapon which made him look like a swiss cheese! It's great viewing quite entertaining and has a very typical but jazzy 1970's music score that accompanies the movie. I would highly recommend this film 70's movies don't get more interesting or as watch able as this.".

Are these just maniacs without a plan? And if they do have a plan how are they all going to escape alive while the world watches?Right away this film grabs you and doesn't let go. Every character plays their role remakably and memorably. Enough suspense to keep you chewing your nails until they are stubs...and most of all a realistic and engrossing storyline. You will literally be on the edge of your seat wondering where the next plot twist will take you.You can easily see where Quentin Tarantino borrowed ideas from this movie to make Reservoir Dogs...and in my opinion this film makes Reservior Dogs look like a second rate film. Its truly a shame most people aren't familiar with this movie and it doesn't have the allure or big star power to draw in new fans seeking out a great film to watchIf you happen to run across The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three though do not pass it up!

	schema:headline " Pelham 123 is in motion";
	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite films from the seventies is The Taking of Pelham One Two Three because it's so New York. Of course the film was shot entirely on location in The Big Apple including the interiors which helped greatly. But more than that the characters have all the New York flavor about them with one exception.The cat of course is led by Walter Matthau who plays a Transit Police Lieutenant. His character is a kind of combination of Archie Bunker and Detective Lennie Briscoe from Law and Order in many ways not terribly admirable. He's also a transit cop and at that time the Transit Police were a separate entity. They were merged into the regular NYPD during the Giuliani administration. There's no real glory in the Transit Police these guys were mostly charged with dealing with drunks and kids with loud boom boxes. If a homicide ever occurred the NYPD quickly took it over as they would in most situations. But this ongoing crisis on a train on the Lexington Avenue Local occurs on his watch and it's career make or break case that Matthau is very aware of. And he proves fully capable during the crisis.The crisis is four men Robert Shaw Earl Hindman Hector Elizondo and Martin Balsam mount a carefully planned assault on a subway train out of Pelham Bay station in the Bronx in midManhattan and hold it and the passengers for ransom for a million dollars. The outsider to New York is Robert Shaw in one of his best roles a former British army officer and mercenary. During the course of the robbery they kill a station supervisor played by roly poly Tom Pedi one very quintessential New Yorker and their coldblooded villainy is established.In fact the whole cast is a microcosm of the ethnic strains of New York City which makes the film so enjoyable especially to one who lived there the first 49 years of his life. Even the mayor is portrayed as a weak fumbling nonentity and back then our mayor was one Abraham D. Beame who was just that probably one of the worst mayors the city ever had. Tony Roberts has a very good role as the tough as nails Deputy Mayor concerned about both his boss's political career and resolving the crisis.The Taking of Pelham One Two Three once the hijack is done is suspense filled and doesn't let up for a moment. I can't give the ending away but the final shot of Walter Matthau's face as the end title music starts and the credits begin to roll is priceless.".

It holds a memorable place for me as the first R rated movie I ever saw as well as the first time I ever heard the F word in a movie.  But way beyond that I was so completely sucked into the story even at my young age.  Now all these years later I still am.  I own the movie and must see it periodically.  I'm so glad reading all the other user comments to find that I'm just one of many who absolutely love this film.  Walter Matthau Robert Shaw Martin Balsam and the rest of the cast are all brilliant.  The comedy in the film is also outstanding and never out of place within the storyline.  It simply serves to make the film more realistic.  And last but not least David Shire's score is the coolest.  I only wish they had put a soundtrack out for this film.  When I watch this movie the music must be cranked.Don't bother catching this film on TV.  It's always completely hacked up. Rent it or buy the DVD.  It will remind you just how much fun movies used to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is my belief that the finest era for films was the 1970's. Consider all the classics that were produced in that era Godfather I and II Patton The Sting Jaws Mean Streets The Exorcist The French Connection Star Wars etc. My belief was recently validated by Jodie Foster who essentially said the same thing. One of the reasons why the films were great was that the directors were ostensibly in control of the films rather than by a committee of the usual Hollywood insiders who think they know what people want to see but rarely make the correct decisions.I know that this film was remade for TVGod knows whybut I'm sure if they attempted another film version Matt Damon would be playing the grizzled transit police cop Matthau's role and Jude Law would be playing the Robert Shaw role. That's another reason why the original and other films of the 70's were so great the casting was more believable. Today Hollywood is so incredibly youthobsessed that actors are completely miscast.I am not stating that this is another 70's classic but even this film is far superior to many of today's films. And yet I'll bet you couldn't find Pelham in your local video store.I love several things about this film. The first thing to hit you is that wonderful funky score that in some parts sounds like controlled chaos. I love the script which is not completely dark despite the underlying theme as there are some very funny moments throughout the film for instance the chagrined look on Matthau's face when he discovers the Japanese visitors can speak English. There are many examples of mistaken identity in this film the supervisor who is gunned down is called goombah but he isn't Italian Matthau thinks the black police captain is white over the radio Matthau mistakes the longhaired undercover cop who was shot on the train tracks for a female. I also love the character who plays the mayor who unbelievably bears a striking resemblance to Mayor Koch who was elected 3 years later!!!! All in all a great action film and one that will hold up for years.Addendum Well they're doing itthey're remaking this film because Hollywood is almost completely bereft of new ideas see Josie and the Pussycats Bewitched the upcoming I Dream of Jeannie. I halfexpect they will remake The Paper Chase next with P.Diddy as Professor Kingsfield.".

	schema:headline " A thrilling heist movie and a love letter to the New York City of our imaginations";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a splendid film from a time when exciting movies still tried to mirror the real world instead of mimicking amusement park rides.On an ordinary day in that most extraordinary city of New York 4 men hijack a subway car. Mr. Blue Robert Shaw is the leader of the gang a precise and icy military man with no war to fight anymore. Mr. Brown Earl Hindman is one of his old comradesinarms. Mr. Green Martin Balsam is a disgraced subway motorman. Mr. Grey Hector Elizondo is a foolish and cocky former mob hitman. They plan to hold the subway car and its 17 passengers hostage until the city gives them one million dollars. Opposing them are New York City transit police lieutenants Zachary Garber and Rico Patrone Walter Matthau and Jerry Stiller whose goals are to keep the hostages alive and figure out how the hijackers plan to escape from an underground tunnel surrounded by dozens and dozens of cops. But the dangerous and deadly crime drama has to share equal billing with a sprawling cast that embodies 1970s New York.That cast and their marvelous performances are really the standout element of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. It's not just Robert Shaw's cerebral precision as Mr. Blue or Walter Matthau's street smart practicality as Garber virtually ever actor shines like a star when they're on screen. They're not just playing individual roles. They're playing the entire city of New York in all its facets  bold angry jaded fearless racist profane impatient selfish selfless sometimes broken but never bowed. This is the New York that everyone loves even the people who wouldn't want to live there. This is a New York where every day is a battle and every New Yorker is a battler. Even if the rest of the film was terrible the atmosphere and personality of these characters would be worth seeing by itself.But the rest of it is just as good. The plot is clever well thought out and fast moving. The direction is unpretentious but affecting. Many big screen films from the 70s look like TV movies by today's standards. That's not the case with The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The story generates tension and suspense without having to resort to cartoonish levels of violence or emotional hysteria. This is also a pretty funny movie though none of the humor is jammed into the script just to get a laugh. It's the humor that real people use as a shield and a sword against the challenges they face in real life.As you may know they did a remake of this. I haven't seen it and I certainly don't plan on it now after having seen the original. I'd bet money that the remake is bigger louder faster and more extravagant in every way than its predecessor. But I'd also bet money the remake is harsh everywhere the original is smooth overwrought everywhere it's refined and aggressive everywhere it's inviting. Hollywood still tells good stories but it seems to have lost the talent for telling this sort of story well. Action movies are now spectacles that assault you as you sit in the theater. The Taking of Pelham One Two Three creates a fuller and more varied experience that excites you without requiring you to turn off your brain.When people say they don't make movies like that any more this is the kind of movie they're talking about. If you've never understood what that saying meant watch this film and be enlightened.".

But the truth is this film is a great film full of extremely talented actors with a dynamite story. Shaw and Matthau are the obvious stars with everyone else putting in a good costarring role.The story takes place on the 6 train no less which happens to be my fave subway line! It was a great surprise when I found the DVD for only ten bucks I would have paid a normal price. And the quality of the DVD transfer is VERY nice. The film though a bit brutal sometimes even has some decent humor even the ending is kinda funny but perfect. I recently watched this on TV just to compare the two versions and see where all the cuts and edits were. You can't go wrong with this film.".

It isn't all action but it's very tense and interesting.  What really tops it off is the thick vein of humour that runs through it  mostly coming from Matthau.Matthau shows how wonderful he is and how he manages to do well in so many different film styles.  His worldweary act is great and his Brooklyn accent is pushed to the fore.  Roberts Shaw is also good but has less of a character and is working hard to sound English.  The cast is actually deep in faces  we have an almost unrecognisable Elizondo Woody Allen actor Tony Roberts a fantastic Mayor from Wallace and Jerry Stiller Ben's dad who doesn't look much older today than he did then!Overall this is very enjoyable but it is made by Matthau.

	schema:headline " New York State Of Crime";
	schema:reviewBody "It takes a rough town to host a tough crime caper. New York City in its bankrupt Ford To City Drop Dead period offers a compelling backdrop to the story of four desperate men who launch a scheme to make the city pay a million dollars by taking a subway car and its passengers hostage. It's a fascinating story with a lot of local color and a perfect distillation of suspense.Funny lines too not clever sitcom banter but reallife wisecracks from people used to living their lives in constant tension delivered with all the electricity of New York Post headlines.Never say you're sorry a senior conductor warns a young trainee. Someone might come out here and hit you in your damn nose.An angry trainmaster Dick O'Neill when reminded about the 18 hostages replies What do they expect for their lousy 35 cents to live forever?When a senior transit cop named Lt. Garber Walter Matthau asks a colleague played by Jerry Stiller to tell some Japanese visitors about the kind of crime they have to deal with Stiller's character replies We had a bomb scare in the Bronx yesterday but it turned out to be a cantaloupe.Matthau's role isn't the most challenging of his career mostly he pushes a lot of buttons and talks into a microphone but he throws up an array of great reaction shots from his first moment of being woken from a catnap to his last one of the most memorable of any 1970s film. I love his reaction when Stiller's Lt. Patrone character offers his theory of how the hijackers plan to get away with the loot by flying the subway to Cuba You're a sick man Rico.The real sick man in this movie is the great Robert Shaw as the lead hijacker who goes by the alias Mr. Blue. Shaw excelled at playing functional psychopaths not to mention dangerous train passengers and here he keeps the suspense on a low boil throughout. He doesn't want to kill anyone not because he's a nice guy but because he's a perfectionist who doesn't want anything to upset his plans. This sets him at odds with his triggerhappy associate Mr. Grey Hctor Elizondo.Matthau's got his own problem associate the trainmaster who's probably feeling guilty about the subordinate he sent to visit the endangered car and their backandforth makes clear this is a shaky bit of business for all concerned.Director Joseph Sargent makes a very dynamic functional story hum with minimal drag. Another New York director of more artistic pedigree say Sidney Lumet would have made a great film from this John Godey novel but he would have paused a bit for whatitallmeans moments. There's none of that here but there are still many fine touches in the execution of this movie. I suspect Lumet got the idea for shooting his Washington Post interiors in All The President's Men from the gritty way the Transit Authority office is shot here with those hot florescent lights that contrast so wonderfully with the dark subway scenes.What else to say? David Shire's masterful score will keep you on the edge of your seat whenever it starts up and the editing by Gerald B. Greenberg and Robert Q. Lovett is up to the level of the scheming bad guys.If you want to see a movie that celebrates the Big Apple when all goes wrong this is a place to go.".

New York City in its bankrupt Ford To City Drop Dead period offers a compelling backdrop to the story of four desperate men who launch a scheme to make the city pay a million dollars by taking a subway car and its passengers hostage. It's a fascinating story with a lot of local color and a perfect distillation of suspense.Funny lines too not clever sitcom banter but reallife wisecracks from people used to living their lives in constant tension delivered with all the electricity of New York Post headlines.Never say you're sorry a senior conductor warns a young trainee. Someone might come out here and hit you in your damn nose.An angry trainmaster Dick O'Neill when reminded about the 18 hostages replies What do they expect for their lousy 35 cents to live forever?When a senior transit cop named Lt. Garber Walter Matthau asks a colleague played by Jerry Stiller to tell some Japanese visitors about the kind of crime they have to deal with Stiller's character replies We had a bomb scare in the Bronx yesterday but it turned out to be a cantaloupe.Matthau's role isn't the most challenging of his career mostly he pushes a lot of buttons and talks into a microphone but he throws up an array of great reaction shots from his first moment of being woken from a catnap to his last one of the most memorable of any 1970s film. I love his reaction when Stiller's Lt. Patrone character offers his theory of how the hijackers plan to get away with the loot by flying the subway to Cuba You're a sick man Rico.The real sick man in this movie is the great Robert Shaw as the lead hijacker who goes by the alias Mr. Blue. Shaw excelled at playing functional psychopaths not to mention dangerous train passengers and here he keeps the suspense on a low boil throughout. He doesn't want to kill anyone not because he's a nice guy but because he's a perfectionist who doesn't want anything to upset his plans. This sets him at odds with his triggerhappy associate Mr. Grey Hctor Elizondo.Matthau's got his own problem associate the trainmaster who's probably feeling guilty about the subordinate he sent to visit the endangered car and their backandforth makes clear this is a shaky bit of business for all concerned.Director Joseph Sargent makes a very dynamic functional story hum with minimal drag. Another New York director of more artistic pedigree say Sidney Lumet would have made a great film from this John Godey novel but he would have paused a bit for whatitallmeans moments. There's none of that here but there are still many fine touches in the execution of this movie. I suspect Lumet got the idea for shooting his Washington Post interiors in All The President's Men from the gritty way the Transit Authority office is shot here with those hot florescent lights that contrast so wonderfully with the dark subway scenes.What else to say? David Shire's masterful score will keep you on the edge of your seat whenever it starts up and the editing by Gerald B. Greenberg and Robert Q. Lovett is up to the level of the scheming bad guys.If you want to see a movie that celebrates the Big Apple when all goes wrong this is a place to go.";

	schema:reviewBody "An absolute classic thriller from the 1970's. Walter Matthau headlines a superb cast in this adrenaline charged roller coaster ride. Matthau is excellent as an everyman thrust into the pivotal position of negotiating with a lunatic who along with his cohorts has hijacked a New York City subway train.Robert Shaw is truly magnificent as the villainous mastermind behind the subway train takeover. But the magic truly starts to simmer in the high tension interplay between Matthau and Shaw as the ruthless killer demands his money while Matthau attempts to achieve the safe release of the victims.Each of the heavies in this picture are identified by colors Mr. Green Grey and so on a plot point which inspired director Quentin Tarantino in his debut film Reservoir DOGS. A solid crew of character actors round out this picture including Jerry Stiller as a transit worker in Matthau's department Martin Balsam is terrific as one of the hijackers with a terrible case of the sniffles. Hector Elizondo in a very early role really makes an impression as an unhinged thug who is more than eager to execute anyone who crosses him.Character actor Lee Wallace is memorable as the New York Mayor particularly for his striking resemblance to New York Mayor Ed Koch. New York City is used to great effect here especially during a frantic sequence featuring a police car making a crucial delivery. The back and forth plotting between the stalled train and the pressure ridden Transit Authority headquarters with Matthau attempting to appease the hijackers is crisply edited and creates wonderful balance in this high stakes thriller. During a decade that featured some of the best movies ever made this one is a jewel not to be missed.".

The movie deserves its own book and ranks right up there with Citizen Kane 1941 as a movie so good there's no way to say how good it is.The use of comedy intercut with tension and true tragedy was never done better in any movie and highlights how important the unlikely marriage of comedy and horror is when it's done well.The James Whale 1930's horror movies two Frankenstein movies and the Invisible Man movie do this well and so did better class scifi space travel movies Destination Moon in 1950 had a comic passenger very important to the film.I was born in New York City and lived there several times in my life and I'm partial to the unique wiseguy oneoneupmanship humor found nowhere else and brilliant when it's done well.In The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three 1974 New York City wiseguy humor is done well....the timing the straight face delivery of outrageous blandness the irony the putdown humor.....only New Yorkers could and have come up with comedy like this.They did it when New York City was truly a city which included people of all backgrounds and income levels all part of the city's life all players. Sadly that is no longer true.New York City in the 21st century has become a city made of up permanent residents who include embarrassingly rich people and desperately poor people who live in the nonManhattan boroughs except for Staten Island also known on maps as Richmond New York City is collectively made up of five different boroughs including Manhattan the Bronx Queens Brooklyn and Richmond also known as Staten Island for nonNew Yorkers who may not know. A commuter population mostly from northern New Jersy south of the Hudson River pour into Manhattan daily to do working class jobs once done relatively recently by Manhattan and other NYC borough residents.The movie's funniest and best actor is Tom Pedi famous for the late 1950's Dash soap commercials on TV and a great character actor. He plays an outrageous outraged long time supervisor worker on the New York subway system named Cas Dolowitz and his performance is incredible.Tom Pedi as Cas Dolowitz plays a proletarian character of dignity importance interest and charisma....not just a piece of background actor scenery decorating scenes dominated by beautiful people main actors.The is a proletarian movie in very important and unusual ways few other films ever are.In a sense every one of the actors in The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three 1974 are character actors and this defines the movie importantly and makes it one of the greatest movies about common people in one of the world's biggest cities ever made.Written by Tex Allen SAG Actor.

	schema:headline " Terrific Upbeat Crime Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "From the first notes of David Shire's groovy score playing at the movie's start you know you're in for a treat. The Taking of Pelham 123 is one of the most enjoyable and upbeat movies I've seen in a while. This is a gritty crime movie with deaths and yet it's also light and humorous in a way action movies no longer are. To find such lightness in a crime movie I have to go back in time back to The Thomas Crown Affair the only crime movie I know that exudes so much elegance and coolness.Four armed men hijack a subway train and demand a ransom for its passengers. In charge is Mr. Blue a courteous serene but implacable mastermind who will not negotiate or change one item in his plans. He gives the authorities one hour to deliver 1000000 dollars and if they're one minute late Mr. Blue and his associates will start killing hostages.Opposing Mr. Blue is Lt. Zachary Garber of the Transit Police. In this role which traditionally should have gone to an action actor is the unlikely Walter Matthau. But for Mr. Blue they chose an actor that matches the role the great Robert Shaw. He's such a bastard playing a hero in Jaws imagine what he can be when he plays an actual villain.Matthau and Shaw are pretty good in their roles. Matthau was especially delightful he brings humour and a humanity that is rare in this type of role. He's not a fighter he's a thinker and a damn good one he not only negotiates with Mr. Blue but also manages to crack the mystery that is at the center of the movie how will four armed men escape an underground tunnel blocked by policemen on both exits? Although in the history of cinema this movie is insignificant I think that in its own genre it's a masterpiece so tightly plotted and efficient in the use of resources to tell the story it's a joy to watch. And it has David Shire's score which is one of the best I've ever heard in my life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Terrific heistflick from the early 70's a golden era for me of moviemaking when quality filmmaking was set in everyday locations amongst identifiably ordinary people but playing out extraordinary situations. The extraordinary situation here mind you is up with the best of them namely the hijacking of a New York City underground train no less its passengers held for ransom by Robert Shaw and his rainbow gang Messrs Green Gray Brown and Blue prefiguring a minor plot device Tarantino would reuse in Reservoir Dogs. Despite lacking a really big name in the cast it is just possible to envisage a McQueen or Newman in Walter Matthau's role this only adds to the everyday mundanity of the scenario presented and enhances the credibility of the situation. It really does look and play like a reallife event aided in this also by the nearrealtime sequence of events depicted. The dialogue is razorsharp very much in the local vernacular with much grim humour abounding the mixture of studio and actual locations wholly convincing and the ensemble acting firstrate. Robert Shaw is very good as the cold calculating mastermind while Walter Matthau for whom the phrase hangdog expression must have been invented gets a break from his numerous comedy castings and is even better as the workaday transport cop whose instincts carry the day even surrounded by dozens of real cops. The narrative is played out tautly with the tension kept right up but as stated isn't afraid to throw in some humour to season the offering here. Thus we get a humorous subplot with Lee Wallace as a fluridden mayor unpopular with his electorate happy to lie in bed watching daytime TV until goaded into action by a very good Tony Roberts as his deputy. The violence is sparing but effective the outofcontrol train at the end again predates Speed by several years with the concluding denouement handled superbly and even if I saw well in advance Martin Balsam's giveaway to Matthau in the last scene it couldn't have been delivered more crisply or succinctly. Certainly no need for alternative endings here. All in all I just thought it was a gripping exhilarating ride of a movie unfairly overlooked and worthy of plaudits which somehow seemed to pass it by on original release.".

It really does look and play like a reallife event aided in this also by the nearrealtime sequence of events depicted. The dialogue is razorsharp very much in the local vernacular with much grim humour abounding the mixture of studio and actual locations wholly convincing and the ensemble acting firstrate. Robert Shaw is very good as the cold calculating mastermind while Walter Matthau for whom the phrase hangdog expression must have been invented gets a break from his numerous comedy castings and is even better as the workaday transport cop whose instincts carry the day even surrounded by dozens of real cops. The narrative is played out tautly with the tension kept right up but as stated isn't afraid to throw in some humour to season the offering here. Thus we get a humorous subplot with Lee Wallace as a fluridden mayor unpopular with his electorate happy to lie in bed watching daytime TV until goaded into action by a very good Tony Roberts as his deputy. The violence is sparing but effective the outofcontrol train at the end again predates Speed by several years with the concluding denouement handled superbly and even if I saw well in advance Martin Balsam's giveaway to Matthau in the last scene it couldn't have been delivered more crisply or succinctly. Certainly no need for alternative endings here. All in all I just thought it was a gripping exhilarating ride of a movie unfairly overlooked and worthy of plaudits which somehow seemed to pass it by on original release.";

The story line is familiar enough that I won't bother going over it much. The notion that the thieves should name themselves after colors  Mr. Brown Mr. Green  was adopted by Tarantino for Reservoir Dogs of course as every Turturro addict knows. I should point out that the novel is at least as good as the film because the author occasionally uses an omniscient point of view and we get some better notion of what the participants in this caper are feeling. The confrontation between the AfricanAmerican kid and Robert Shaw on the subway platform is more amusing for instance. In the film the kid glares at Shaw and Shaw can only smile back. In the novel we are taken inside the kid's head and invited to play with him the game that he plays with people like Shaw. He has this idea you see that if he stares at some stranger with this particularly menacing expression he HYPMOTIZE him! As it turns out Shaw is nobody to play games with. In deciding whom to execute Shaw looks around the car and thinks about the flatout drunken woman. She'd be the least missed. But on the other hand who am I to play God. The exposition in the novel is clumsy but adds to our understanding of what's going on. We get more information about how many cars there are on a subway train how long the train is how many transit cops are around and how they relate to the NYPD. Kind of interesting in a touristy way. The Japanese monkeys in the movie serve their comedic purpose. Anyone who has seen footage of the real Tokyo subway system in operation must suspect that they view the New York City subway system as a paragon of order and good taste.

Walter Mathau is at his slouching NewYorkese best grumbling kwetching outfitted in a droopy suit with a startling canary yellow tie. And  well look at the movie. Here we are given a story about the hijacking of a subway train  and there is not a single exploding fireball.There is some shooting with automatic weapons and pistols but not much of that and nobody wields two Uzzis at once. Nobody's head balloons into jelly. There is no blood and no final shoot out in an unused deadend tunnel or empty warehouse. Mathau doesn't even carry a gun. The movie ends with a sneeze and an ironically polite German blessing. The acting is up to snuff the narrative easy enough to follow and exciting if not entirely believable. The villains are neatly differentiated. The lowbrow greedy exmotorman of Martin Balsam who practically embodies New York City in its grittier aspects Shaw's icy disdain Elizondo's angry psychopathy. It's an enjoyable movie all around. The fact that it was made when it was in 1974 helps in understanding why the story and characters weren't overwhelmed by special effects. Cf. Stallone's movie about the Holland Tunnel. Everyone in that movie should have been drowned who would want to go to New Jersey anyway? The state smells like somebody's old sweatshirt.It ought to be mentioned that despite the tension and occasional violence this is a pretty funny movie. Much of the humor grows out of urban ethnic cynicism and vulgarity. Yiddish is flung around profligately  Mishigas putz. The transit supervisor a PolishAmerican is accosted by a released hostage who shouts I'm gonna SUE you! Hear me? I'm gonna SUE your a. Cas Dolowitz bellows back an obscene Italian expression that can be roughly rendered as fanablagotz! It would be nice to turn back the clock and be able to watch a film like The Taking of Pelham One Two Three on a regular basis.

Before doing so in reply to those who have seen it and have made comments on things such as the sound camera work lighting etc. it should be reminded that this film was shone at the festival in the Special Presentations category and was listed as a work in progress. The filmmakers were hustling to get the film edited as much as they could before the first showing in hopes of finding a distributor. That said minor details such as those mentioned need to be taken with a grain of salt. If released theatrically or to DVD alone it will be further cleaned up and edited. But I digress because that wasn't what I was paying attention to while watching this movie. I go to see a movie for the story the characters andor the actors not the lighting sound or costumes. Now on to my review In a nutshell this movie was fantastic and the performance of Johnny Depp was nothing short of brilliant.I was captivated from the moment Depp begins his monologue as the Earl of Rochester to assure the audience that You will not like me to the very end of his epilogue where he asks How do you like me now? Depp impeccably captured the essence of a man who despised life drank profusely seduced women condescended everyone from the King to his mother to his servant and preferred to have his portrait done with a monkey rather than his wife. Hmmm not too much to like right? On the contrary. Mixed with his utter disrespect for life was his charm his wit his irresistibility and his desire to do whatever he pleased. As such I had conflicting feelings of hatred pity love and admiration for Rochester. This was due entirely to Depp's performance. As Rochester's fatal disease begins to take it's toll Depp transforms into a creature almost too unbearable to look at. You will weep and shudder at the same time. It is without doubt Depp's best work to date and I'm convinced that no other actor could have portrayed him as brilliantly as Johnny. John Malkovich as Charles II and Samantha Morton as Rochester's mistress are wonderful as well and contribute nicely to a movie mixed with humor sex tragedy and darkness. All said it was a movie I would highly recommend and would love desperately to see again.".

	schema:headline " A personal synopsis of the Libertine";
	schema:reviewBody "The Libertine was a brilliant period piece. It was a tragically realistic yet witty and humorous look at the Restoration period in England but more specifically depicted the latter stages of the life of the Second Earl Of Rochester a poet who endured a short and debauched life. Here was a man so highly intelligent yet so bored with life that he thrived by consistently pushing his limits and the boundaries of his relationships.Johnny Depp eloquently and emotionally portrayed the Earl of Wilmot. This has to be by far his most brilliant achievement in a long line of unique and amazing performances. Mr. Depp's portrayal of the Earl showed a range of emotions incredible nuances and a depth of empathy never before seen on screen best illustrated during the scene where The Earl addresses parliament  which has to be the most gut wrenching scene rife with fervor but with credibility. Suffice it to say by the end of this movie I had been reduced to tears and cheers both at times coinciding. This is definitely an Oscar worthy performance. The golden statue is a must.The supporting cast was also excellent most notably the actor who played the Earl's servant and who appeared to have a great rapport with Mr. Depp on screen. Samantha Morton also superb as Mrs. Barry gave a lovely and unobtrusive performance as was required for this character.Laurence Dunmore captured the atmosphere of the period exquisitely with simplicity yet with a keen eye to detail. The reproduction of the 'family' Portrait of the Earl with the monkey is an excellent example. The lighting the sets the costumes all added to the reality of the movie. The musical score by Michael Nyman beautifully augmented the spirit of the times and of this production.The Libertine was a work in progress when I viewed it twice at the Toronto Film Fest. I cannot imagine a scene being cut even the more risqu dreams are required to impart the true emotional state of the Earl at that time in his life. Before passing judgment on this film I suggest that one see it at least twice so as to appreciate the full impact of the movie  to fully identify with the meaning and the thought behind this production.The Libertine is a wonderful piece of art representing the true raison d'tre of this poet with incredible wit and insight. Congratulations to all who graced the production of the Libertine.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Libertine was a brilliant period piece. It was a tragically realistic yet witty and humorous look at the Restoration period in England but more specifically depicted the latter stages of the life of the Second Earl Of Rochester a poet who endured a short and debauched life. Here was a man so highly intelligent yet so bored with life that he thrived by consistently pushing his limits and the boundaries of his relationships.Johnny Depp eloquently and emotionally portrayed the Earl of Wilmot. This has to be by far his most brilliant achievement in a long line of unique and amazing performances.

	schema:reviewBody "This wasn't a glamorized period costume drama that Hollywood loves to overdo and it wasn't NC17 for nothing! There was some technical roughness and lack of continuity but they were minor quibbles in what I considered a triumph. The mood the sets and cinematography the script and most of all the acting were all of the highest and most innovative caliber. Depp was in almost every scene and was fascinating beyond anything I'd ever experienced. His force and range of emotion and naturalness were exceptionally powerful and moving from first to last. You hated him and loved him were repulsed by him and felt pity for him. You were drawn to him almost against your will like a vortex pulling you in. All else paled in comparison. This was a Johnny Depp that I'd never seen before but so hope I have a chance to again. This performance is the crowning glory to date of his illustrious career and I see no limits to what he can accomplish in the future. Everyone else was uniformly excellent although Samantha Morton didn't portray the allure the Elizabeth Barry in the play had. My primary recommendation for improving this work in progress before theatrical release center around clarifying motivations up front for why these people were the way they were. This could be done by a combination of edits and additions. I found I liked it even better and was more moved by it the second time I saw it when I wasn't concentrating as much on following the storyline. This was a movie I loved and can't get it out of my mind. It was stunning and compelling beyond anything I've seen in a very long while.".

	schema:reviewBody "What images are conjured up by the title! Especially when we know in advance the lead is to be played by the handsome Johnny Depp. Perhaps a likable rake a dissolute even fashionable but very colourful icon of male supremacy  to be forgiven by female fans if they can watch from the safety of a cinema seat!The reality is a disturbingly different film dark and sombre a 17th century candlelit England a portrait of the poet and debauchee John Wilmot and one that ultimately bows out to a feminist heroine in the form of the great actress Elizabeth Barry played by Samantha Morton.In an opening prologue Wilmot tells the audience that they will not like him. With the gusto characteristic of Depp he throws himself into his melodramatic character in a way that is markedly different from his many halfserious halfcomic roles. As if to win his wager he is out to repulse us  but not just with licentious excess the tragedy of Wilmot is that he possesses genius but is unable to use it to furnish his own fulfilment. He is a tragic character no Don Juan that follows a promiscuous lifestyle as a summum bonum but a man of inner greatness for whom the outer world is so boring that he loses himself in drink and sexual excess and eventually alienates those around him. I have to speak my mind he says for it is always more interesting than what is going on around me.As the 2nd Earl of Rochester Wilmot is in and out of favour at the court of Charles II John Malkovitch and frequently upsets his lovely wife Rosamund Pike with his whoring and drinking. But his wife's jealousy is eventually piqued not so much by the loose women or the alehouse but by Wilmot's love of the theatre  especially in the form of prostitutedestinedforgreatness Elizabeth Barry. At a time before the emancipation of women when the stage had recently been the sole province of men Barry is determined to make it as an actress. She is hobbled by inexperience and a lowly position but Wilmot takes her under his patronage and tutelage. Wary of the deal Barry resists saying she wants to rise by her own efforts  not so Wilmot can take the credit! He asks her what drives her and her response her passion for theatre the desire to thrill and move an audience is one that Wilmot identifies with for he is tired of the lukewarm pastiches that trivialise even great writing.Unfortunately for Wilmot his own greatness is on the ebb. It was said of him that he was A man whom the muses were fond to inspire but ashamed to avow. His taunting of the king and a scurrilous lampoon of Charles II in front of the French ambassador help to seal his fate. Samantha Morton continues to show her acting talents with a substantial if not substantial enough part and Malkovitch is an adequate counterbalance to the very considerable stage presence of Depp. The screenplay based on an earlier play starring Malkovitch sparkles with wit and even if the direction is a little uneven or turgid at times it is an admirable and important debut from Laurence Dunmore. The desaturated colours and muddy rainsodden English countryside create an air of foreboding entirely appropriate for a work that is more serious than its title suggests.Intellectually we are treated to the drollness and intelligence of Wilmot but realise that he is a 'lockedin' and isolated character a loner and barely appreciated trailblazer in some respects like the great Marlon Brando to whose memory among others the film is dedicated. We also see the folly and weakness of his philosophy. Wilmot wroteConsider real Honour then You'll find hers cannot be the same 'Tis noble confidence in men In women mean mistrustful shame.Yet it was the honour of the lowly Elizabeth Barry that ultimately inspired him and somehow remained ever out of reach.".

We were blown away and that is the best way to describe it. It was funny in parts raunchy in others and finally tearjerking. I found myself holding my breath so many times because Depp's acting was so amazing.When Rochester starts to show the ravages of his disease towards the end all I could think of was that Johnny FINALLY got his wish....to play a character as ugly as possible with his face so mutilated and scarred that he was almost beyond recognition. It was MAGNIFICENT!! He was truly hideous and it was a good reminder of the toll that syphilis took on a person in those days. This movie is not for the fainthearted or easily offended. It's mid17th century England at it's grubbiest filthiest and most depraved. There is foul language plenty of nudity and phallic symbols are used liberally throughout this film although Rochester is always fully clothed.We definitely felt there was much more chemistry between Johnny and Rosamund Pike who played his wife than between Johnny and Samantha Morton. Perhaps it was supposed to seem that Morton's character Elizabeth Barry did not really 'click' with Rochester as that was the impression we were left with.The sex scenes even between Rochester and Barry are rough  almost emotionless as opposed to being actual 'love' scenes. It was the opinion of our group that Johnny Depp has elevated himself to that upper echelon of actors who are to be revered for their skills and talent. This role is the crowning glory of his career to date and it's time he is given his due for being one of the best actors of our time.Although the film needs some finetuning we left the theater in awe of the magnificent performances we had just witnessed.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Wilmot was a complex brilliant man. Having read about him and having read his poetry I was not certain a film about him could be done that portrayed those points in any meaningful way. The Libertine shows Wilmot for what he was a man of many personalities interests and indulgences.When the story begins after a marvelous prologue warning the audience not to like him Wilmot is for the most part still well. He returns after once again being banned from his precious city having missed all of the good plays. You will discover later just how important a play is to him. He carouses with his friends coming up with excellent extemporaneous lines of verse at their insistence.The heart of the film is struck when he enters the theater and witnesses the dismal failure of a newcomer to the stage. He sees in this woman a potential for taking the theater in an exciting new direction of realism and becomes determined to work with her to have her become the diamond in the crown of London's theater.At the same event the King welcomes Wilmot back and gives him a service to perform. It is quite apparent that Wilmot has no love for the King nor his assigned task. How little regard the Earl has for said King and task is the other major thread of the story. Much of The Libertine is spent in taking us along with the Earl as he proves his wit is far exceeds the determination of the monarch to manipulate.All the while the Earl himself is dying. He has lived his life in his own fashion always exceeding in every instance. Disgrace does not deter him banishment does not deter him. To live is to go too far and that is Wilmot's rule.The characters surrounding Wilmot are engrossing. From the servant Allcock who does his best to prove his is allcock to the favored whore to the less than enthusiastic actor who turns down the offered role everyone is either there to point the way to overindulgence or to run from it. Banned yet again from London Wilmot shows us his own expertise as actor as he turns quack physician Dr. Bendo. The good doctor's cures are embodied by urine and fornication.Finally Bendo is exposed to be none other than Rochester and brought back yet again to be told by the King that to be ignored is the only solution. Wilmot is returned to his country home to die. He flails at death and in a masterful scene shows us that of which he is made. He drags his useless body made up face and false nose into the House of Lords on crutches. He offers a speech to save the line of succession that finally exposes what he could have been all along. You see at last fully what his talents were and how he has wasted them on his life of surfeit.And finally you see him die. He has taken the short journey from brilliant scurrilous profligate to corpse. He accepts the angels dancing on pin which he's always fought. Watching you long for him to be young and well again to continue his journey.While the film I saw was a workinprogress you could see a masterful story there. A little work on the soundtrack a snip here or there of footage and this will be a film everyone will want to see and discuss.The performances are magnificent. Johnny Depp has never played a role like this before and you will be awe struck by his ability. John Malkovitch is stately and restrained. Samantha Morton does not let you forget that her purpose is to succeed upon the stage and not in the bedroom. The music seems strange at first then insinuates itself into the piece until nothing else would serve.".

Wilmot is returned to his country home to die. He flails at death and in a masterful scene shows us that of which he is made. He drags his useless body made up face and false nose into the House of Lords on crutches. He offers a speech to save the line of succession that finally exposes what he could have been all along. You see at last fully what his talents were and how he has wasted them on his life of surfeit.And finally you see him die. He has taken the short journey from brilliant scurrilous profligate to corpse. He accepts the angels dancing on pin which he's always fought. Watching you long for him to be young and well again to continue his journey.While the film I saw was a workinprogress you could see a masterful story there. A little work on the soundtrack a snip here or there of footage and this will be a film everyone will want to see and discuss.The performances are magnificent. Johnny Depp has never played a role like this before and you will be awe struck by his ability. John Malkovitch is stately and restrained. Samantha Morton does not let you forget that her purpose is to succeed upon the stage and not in the bedroom. The music seems strange at first then insinuates itself into the piece until nothing else would serve.";

	schema:reviewBody "My experience in viewing Laurence Dunmore's The Libertine at the Toronto Film Festival left me overwhelmed and in a high emotional state of awe and praise. The dramatic opening prolog was enough to convince me that Johnny Depp is the life force in this powerful film. He is more than an actor portraying a character he is a force that knows no limitations nor will stop at anything. His performance in The Libertine had such an effect that I was overwhelmed and moved to the point of tears and fear. Once sitting in the darkened theater I was not prepared for what I was about to witness. Slowly coming into view his beautiful face emerges as big as life itself and from his sinister and well formed sensual lips he speaks the words You're not going to like me. From there this man gives the most gut wrenching speech I have ever heard. This is Johnny Depp like you've never seen before. Powerful intense and compelling are an understatement. I felt as if I were hit between the eyes with a fortyfive automatic and left spent without even remembering the act. Even Laurence Dunmore could not say enough about Johnny's performance and I give him high praise for his art in progress. In my opinion Dunmore handed the reins to Johnny allowing him to play the Earl without restraint. Not only was Dunmore courageous with that decision he was brilliant in doing so. This period piece about the wretched Earl of Rochester has him go through incredible transformations and willingly pulled me along with each gritty step. I loved him I despised him and I wanted him. Most of all I felt him in my soul and this I will never forget. This Oscar worthy performance by Johnny Deep truly needs to be experienced.The film was the perfect vehicle in allowing Laurence Dunmore his creativity to soar with its wonderfully wicked and gritty feel and intense acting from Johnny Depp and Samantha Morton. John Malkovitch was superb as well however I would have liked to have seen more scenes with him and Mr. Depp.After watching Johnny Depp in The Libertine I am convinced he is a powerful force who not only took my breath away but held me on his rock hard pedestal and kissed my soul.".

It captures so much a dark and frenzied time in history full of intrigue and plotting. It is such a dark and muddy film but added up to a unique and refreshingly different cinematic experience. Thought it was Johhny Depp's best performance to date and also Samantha Mortan was fabulous as the determined and hardened actress who succeeded in out smarting the Earl and getting what she wanted.

Johnny Depp Samantha Morton John Malkovich lots of good things said at various film festivals... but the lack of a widespread release should have been a hint. This film isn't very good at all.It will mark me as a philistine to say so but I thought about 78 of the film was pretentious rubbish. Much of the dialogue was authentically 17th century but it was hard to listen to because the sound mix was bad and the print was so grainy it looked like a pirate DVD. Perhaps not being able to clearly see or hear the goingson was intentional but the lack of plot didn't give us much else to concentrate on. There was lots of artful focusing and unfocusing which just appeared as though the cameraman didn't know what he was doing. But most obvious of all was the fact that it was all pretty boring and everyone was acting their little socks off in it to make it worthy. There are several scenes between Depp and Morton where he coaches her to be a better actress. These scenes drag terribly they are unmoving and longwinded and slow the film to a virtual halt.I will give credit where it's due and say that Johnny Depp in a long curly wig eyeliner and cocked hat was worth seeing. The servant character was excellent. And to be fair the whole boring shebang massively improved about 20 minutes before the end. At this point the Earl gets syphilis becomes horribly disfigured loses control of his bladder and has to start wearing a strapon metal nose when his real nose rots away. He also gives a jolly rousing speech in the House of Lords which makes us actually care about him for the first time in the film. If the whole thing had been anything like as engaging as the last 20 minutes it would have been an excellent film. As it is our Christmas and Thanksgiving turkey has been served up early.Still worth going to see if only to witness John Malkovich's 'English' accent. You'd think he'd know better after starring alongside Ted Theodore Logan in Dangerous Liaisons but no.".

IMHO it's about time a filmmaker had the guts to show such a period piece accurately.2 The movie is about wasted talent. It's a morality tale. Whether from drink or deeply rooted personalitymental disorder or both this man had a brilliantly clever mind and he wasted it. He was numb for a whole variety of reasons many are not detailed in the movie admittedly and was therefore constantly trying to feel. He became bogged down in the fatalistic and cynical view that life is meaningless rather than in trying to make his life mean something. The movie shows his resulting struggles and the suffering he causes those who care about him while he gradually is made through horrible consequence to see how such waste leads to his own destruction.3 The movie has a message beyond the question of one man's redemption or lack thereof. Don't waste life's gifts use them wisely. He started to see the error of his ways by the end of the film a little too late I'm sure he realizes makes attempts to mend with mixed success and thus asks the question do you like me now. 4 Johnny Depp's performance is beyond description. He loses himself in yet another character and from accent to mannerisms is completely consistent in his depiction. The negative reviewers obviously take this seemingly limitless talent for granted. Let their loss not be yours.5 It's about time a movie actually contains some dialog as opposed to merely being a pasted together trite conglomeration of oneliners and head shots.6 See the movie.".

I was captivated and moved by every performance and haven't seen a collective effort like this in ages. The entire cast was incredible. I was surprised at how many funny moments it had and how none of it was in any way boring or longwinded as the reviews stated. The review that got to me was how it had rendered Johnny Depp charmless....alls I've got to say is that Johnny Depp in this performance could charm the pants off of Mother Theresa. I don't know who the woman was who wrote that but she she must be frigid not to mention blind deaf and dumb. Movies are religion for me and I go once or twice a week. I cannot imagine a movie like Brokeback Mountain getting all of this great press while an absolute masterpiece like this is set aside. I liked Brokeback Mountain but for me it was not much different from any afterschool special I've ever seen. The Libertine at least takes a bawdy and desperate character like the Earl Of Rochester and MAKES you love him despite everything he does to make you feel otherwise. Johnny Depp is a God. No less. He and Marth Plimpton both deserve Oscars. I'd love to see this little film storm the Oscars...poetic justice...no pun intended.".

Please watch for the Spaniel Scene compare the dogs in this one with the dogs in the early films. Keep track of the wigs too. This version is much more realistic than Stage Beauty but it is a close call. Like Stage Beauty it flopped in Paris. They like violent American cop films and weary eerie flicks and magical kid wizards trickery here these days. Stage Beauty lasted exactly one week and did not even go out to the small cinema houses after its week in the major theatres. If you are interested in the subject of Charles II and the Restoration you can still find copies of Lord Rochester's Monkey by Graham Greene who wrote it in the thirties but decided to publish it much later. My copy which I found at Amazon.Com was published by Bodley Head in 1974. It is full of engravings and formal portraits from the Restoration era.".

It awakens something within a passion for life that isn't there when he is home with his gorgeous wife ElizabethRosamund Pike. When he pulls one prank too manya hilariously perverse play for a French man of great importance that Charles wishes to impress for money his country has a lack of consisting of dildo's and the Earl himself dressed to the nines exactly as his King in a form of mockeryhis life descends into disease and poverty. His body ravaged with pox and his face overwhelmed with horrible diseased scarring..his nose needs a silver covering while he can barely walk hobbling everywhere he goes. He would lie dead a shell of what he once was at age 33.The film doesn't judge John Wilmot but certainly shows who he was and the film is frank in dialogue how he spoke. He followed the wants of the flesh despite the feelings of his Godfearing mother or his dutiful wife who took and took without anything given back to her. Wilmot was kept by Charles because of his abilities but even those become futile as he slowly washes out reality with the alcohol he consumes. Though the film is fascinating to me because of Johnny Depp's performance. Depp is enigmatic and Rochester..he held my interest the entire time. The film is directed by a handheld which may drive purists batty who are used to period pieces being lensed in a slick pattern. The director here seems to what to bring an ugliness and povertystricken feel to Charles' land at this point and time..by having the camera move even at times where the camera seems to be held by some amateur using his camcorder taping live events from the 1800's we feel like we're actually nearby watching Rochester ruin his life as a voyeur. I always felt that is why directors of today like to binge on the handhelds. They want to bring a personal feel to the viewer as if we are placed right within the action of that moment. I liked the use of this device in this film not to mention the dirty cinematography so many critics fussed about. I like that the film shows the period as ugly and deformed as Rochester becomes. But without Depp's giving his all to this character showing him with all the faults and loss the film wouldn't be as successful as I thought it was.".

	schema:headline " Johnny Depp triumphant as repellent Johnny Wilmot";
	schema:reviewBody "The Libertine takes as its subject John Wilmot the second Earl of Rochester Johnny Depp an English 17th century courtier who was a drunken womanising rake with a taste for the occasional man or boy and a writer of obscene verses which made fun of his peers including his friend King Charles II John Malkovich but who at the same time was a sublime poet when he chose. One major lapse of the movie is that it makes little of this last aspect of Rochester's character focusing almost exclusively on his seamy side. The real Rochester was also a war hero at one period in his life but the film seems to make no reference at all to this. Though more than a tad stagy betraying its origins as a play and possibly not making as much of its hero's contradictions as it might how could such a proponent of personal freedom so strongly defend the monarchy? the film provides a compelling portrait of Rochester and of the times in which he lived.

	onyx:emotionText "The Libertine takes as its subject John Wilmot the second Earl of Rochester Johnny Depp an English 17th century courtier who was a drunken womanising rake with a taste for the occasional man or boy and a writer of obscene verses which made fun of his peers including his friend King Charles II John Malkovich but who at the same time was a sublime poet when he chose. One major lapse of the movie is that it makes little of this last aspect of Rochester's character focusing almost exclusively on his seamy side. The real Rochester was also a war hero at one period in his life but the film seems to make no reference at all to this. Though more than a tad stagy betraying its origins as a play and possibly not making as much of its hero's contradictions as it might how could such a proponent of personal freedom so strongly defend the monarchy? the film provides a compelling portrait of Rochester and of the times in which he lived.

	schema:reviewBody "Completed only a few years before the end of his short life La Vida No Vale Nada earned Pedro Infante a Silver Ariel for Mexico's best male performance of 1955. Infante remains the primary reason to see this episodic somewhat disjointed film. The Mexican star plays Pablo an illiterate alcoholic drifter who has bouts with the bottle and interludes with several women of varying character a loving widow a generous professional his saintly mother and his father's lusty mistress. While attractive Infante does not have stereotypical moviestar looks and is convincing as a common man who struggles with existence. Women play a significant role in Pablo's life and offer him redemption love and sex for which he seems to offer little in return. Although he reunites with his mother he bonds most closely with his beachcomber father whose destiny he seems fated to follow.Fortunately the movie offers opportunities for Infante to sing and his voice rich and velvety in tone provides another reason to see the film. In two scenes however the actor sings while he is supposedly intoxicated. Although enjoyable these sequences are somewhat incredible because his enunciation and notes are perfect despite his inebriation. That a goodlooking man with such a rich voice would have to scratch out a living with odd jobs also stretches the plot's believability.Although others in the cast perform well the film is Infante's show and his charm supports its weaker sections. Rogelio Gonzalez's direction is competent although the transitions from episode to episode at times leave the viewer wondering if scenes were edited out. The IMDb plot outline for this film bears no relation to La Vida No Vale Nada and must refer to another film with the same title. Despite its flaws this oftenentertaining film is a showcase for the talents of one of Mexico's greatest stars. Although the movie is not worthy of his talents La Vida No Vale Nada provides a showcase for the dramatic and vocal skills of the great Pedro Infante.".

This is a canny move as it pulls in the viewer via the blurring action before beginning to develop the film's narrative in the middle third. While the story is a well used one kungfu bully comes to realise his skills can be used to educate rather than brutalise it's a perfect structure on which to hang the film's many excellent confrontations. It's obvious that this film is Li's love letter to his Wu Shu background and martial arts in general. In dramatic terms Fearless never reaches the heights of recent wuxia movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Hero and so is unable to feel truly fulfilling as a great movie per se. It is however up there with Jet Li's very best work in the genre OUATIC  Fist of Legend for example and if it is sadly true that it is to be his last period martial arts picture it's a hell of a bang to go out on.".

We don't have to wade through the typical love triangle the maniacal drug lord contracting a hit or the beloved school's instructor being tortured and murdered before the ultimate revenge takes place. This film has a legitimate story line skillfully presented in a clear and well edited manner.Although the film was generally concerned with the development of a specific fighting style and philosophy the audience is also treated to some authenticity of the then Chinese culture and the biography of a Chinese martial arts master. These features seem to give the production a much higher level of credibility than the average martial arts action movie.Although we did experience some speed editing in fight scenes it was done in such a way that it enhanced rather than detracted from the believability of the film. In House of Flying Daggers for example the ballet and acrobatic like choreography of some of the fight scenes tended to undermine rather than enhance. If there was any flaw in the fight scenes present it was minor. This flaw may have been inescapable because of the inherent limitations of the style of the film itself. For example trivial features such as disconnected striking combinations at the expense of speed editing or the fact that the Japanese martial artist did not seem to be using a typical Japanese style of fighting. It appeared to be a combination of Chinese and Korean oriented styles.This film should by all rights reset the bar for the standards of martial arts films from now on. It was simply an outstanding film in every way.".

	schema:headline " Jet Li's best film in years!";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's get to the point. This is Jet Li's best movie in years. Not because of the fight scenes but because the plot is engaging throughout and the emotional tension of the movie works even though it was a bit tangled with a bit of preach.The plot is simple. I think everyone here knows about it so I won't spent time talking too much about it. Jet Li plays Huo Yuan Jia an arrogant young man that has no regard for human life so to speak and in one brash move he indirectly caused the death of his family. He journey to a remote village to learn humility. This is probably the weakest part of the film. Mainly because a large part of it was cut out from the theatrical release. Huo had a few dialogues with Betty Sun who played a blind girl. Their relationship was very underdeveloped. And Huo's return to Shanghai to fight was with brevity and hardly explained. He returns to Shanghai and defends his country's honor.I thought Jet Li did a great job acting both as the arrogant man and as the wiser wushu master. But people of course came to see Jet Li fight. And to me the earlier fight scenes are good but have too much computer effects and slow motion. Still it was refreshing to see Jet Li return to using Chinese Kung Fu.The best fight scenes in the movie are definitely the battle between Huo and Nathan Jones the hulking giant and the weapons fight between the Japanese Samurai and Jet Li using the sword against the three sectional staff. The ending was very emotional and it was refreshing to see a different take unlike most endings of old Jet Li movies.The movie could have been better of course but I was very satisfied with it both the plot and the action sequences.910".

	schema:headline " Indeed it is a Fearless hit !";
	schema:reviewBody "Fearless marks Jet Li's last martial art production where i am glad to say he did not let anyone down in his martial art swan song.Worked together with director Ronny Yu of The Bride With White Hair and Freddy VS Jason Fearless marks the return of Jet and Ronny in the Asia market from Hollywood failures such as Lethal Weapon 4 The One and Formula 51.Jet portrays the life of martial art master Huo Yuan Jia which is also the Chinese title for the film. Fearless surrounds how he restored the pride and glory of the Chinese during the early 1900's from the intrusion and invasion of the Western powers and the growing Japanese power where they have been calling the Chinese 'the sick man of Asia.' Huo Yuan Jia proves them wrong by accepting the challenges of the American fighters the British and Spanish fighters and the Japanese samurai Tanaka Japanese actor Shidou Nakamura of Ima Ai Ni Yukimasu or Be With You fame. But before we have the showdown before Tanaka and Huo we are introduced to the past of Huo who was then a proud and arrogant fighter who wants to make himself the one and only invincible fighter of TianJin Huo's hometown. His arrogance and past victory from the competition indirectly leads to the death of his mother and daughter where he killed one of his opponent just to prove that he is invincible.Huo lost his sanity after the death of his loved ones and he drowns into a river where he was saved by a young lady and her granny. Living with them for 7 years makes Huo realize the real meaning of martial arts which he eventually sets up Jing Wu Martial Art School to promote the value of strengthening and developing Mind Body and Soul.Previously stated in his interview on making a movie that he truly ones Jet Li has achieved his objective in Fearless. Unlike any other BAction flick focusing on how well the actor fights Fearless carry the message of not to resort violence to settle any problem where we can see how violence did to Huo's loved ones.The showdown between Huo and other foreign fighters also promotes the idea of sparing your enemy a chance no matter how deadly they could be. This somehow reflects on part of the idea and philosophy Jet Li understands and promotes from his one year Buddhism studies.Director Ronny Yu has also made the right choice of casting Jet Li as Huo Yuan Jia after Jet portrays Huang Fei Hong in his remarkable Once Upon A Time Trilogy. This has once again strengthen the image of Jet Li as the Chinese hero among the Chinese around the world.Casting Shidou Nakamura as Tanaka one of the main supporting cast is fresh and new where he was more well known for his role of Takumi the husband who had an encounter with his late wife in Ima Ai Ni Yukimasu. Nakamura was more well for romantic and heart warming dramas. The showdown between Jet and Nakamura has not only make Fearless a must watch but also the climax of the film.However Fearless is badly edited from the original 150 min version. To fit in the market demand Fearless has been mercilessly chopped into a 103 min theatrical version. Michelle Yeoh who makes a special appearance in Fearless has been unfortunately removed. The duel between Jet Li and Thai boxer has also been removed sad to say. Somehow the movie has make the audience wants to go for something more than 103 min version.Hope that the DVD release of Fearless will not disappoint the fans of Jet Li and anyone who loves the film with the deleted scenes. Apart from that Fearless is remarkable. Definitely a must watch !".

One can interpret the message of the movie in many ways. It is a movie about conquering yourself about the meaning of honor and what it really means to be respected. Jet Li's character evolves from basically a glorified bully to the founder of a true Martial Arts competition based on respect of people and of fighting art. It is also a movie about how industry screws up... everything really.I personally feel that the film had enough material to be turned into a miniseries. The time from his personal tragedy to his realizing the meaning of his father's words it's very short and could have been expanded.In conclusion this is a great movie of Jet Li's and it's not only for martial arts lovers. I feel that his last block busters were meaningless violence films. Fearless is obviously NOT one of these movies. Enjoy.".

	schema:headline " Fearless";
	schema:reviewBody "Fearless has a similar structure to last years' Unleashed 2005 in that this is not just a martial arts extravaganza but also a film with heart and proper acting on the part of Jet Li. This latest effort despite flaws is the much more accomplished of the two works both contain exceptional and brutal fight scenes and a central 'drama' section where Li's character learns about life and about who he is and both of these aspects are handled better in Fearless. Based on actual events the story focuses on Li's Huo Yuanjin martial arts master whose family is murdered and who flees his home only to be taken in by simple farmers. Spending many years there Huo learns to embrace peace and live out his simple life with the villagers. However he is tempted back to his home town in an effort to show the foreign powers that are flooding China that the Chinese people are unified and will not be suppressed by foreigners. He sets up a martial arts school and competes in a fourway tournament to prove that he is the greatest fighter in the world.Make no mistake the main appeal to the film is the fight sequences. Courtesy of the ever versatile Yuen Wo Ping The Matrix Trilogy Crouching Tiger the staggering fight choreography manages to combine the graceful moves of Hero 2002 with the brutality of Unleashed to create possibly the greatest action scenes put to film aided by Jet Li's sogooditlookseasy martial arts capabilities. The film starts as it means to go on and contains plenty of inventive action the main highlights being a colossal oneonone in a restaurant and of course the climactic fourway tournament. The film is not all action though at its centre is the time spent with the villagers where Huo 'finds himself'. This is perhaps the films weakest point but it is held up by the fact that Jet Li showing he's not only a martial arts expert can actually act. However the scenes are lacking from a scripting and directing point of view enough emotional depth to allow us to truly get involved. Being based on a true story the film had to play out as it did but one feels that Huo could have gone anywhere to find himself even stayed at home and become a recluse. Director Ronnie Yu lacks the directorial range to let these scenes flourish so the section begins to bog itself down with unnecessary sentimentality. However it is a more developed section than the comparable parts in Unleashed and although maybe is too short  it could have been developed into much more  it at least doesn't outstay its welcome. Jet Li is good though and nicely moves from the arrogance of his early days to the wiser warrior in the second half. Fearless shows us a moralistic China that is ruled by an honour that is now lost amongst the modern world and its portrayal of upholding traditional values is a welcome move it gives the film purpose and not just an excuse to make good action scenes. Ironically the films message is one of antiviolence and if this is indeed to be Jet Li's last martial arts film then he has gone out on a high.Rated 810More reviews at httpwww.thelazylounge.net".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Fearless";
	schema:reviewBody "The first Jet Li movie which I watched as a little boy was his Shaolin Temple. Jet next shot to fame and prominence with the various Chinese folk heroes that he played in the late 80s and 90s like Wong Fei Hong Fong Sai Yuk Zhang San Feng and even taking on Bruce Lee's Chen Zhen role in a Fist of Fury remake called Fist of Legend. In Fearless he plays martial arts master Huo Yuanjia  Fok Yuen Gaap whom I presume most who are familiar with Fist of Fury will know who this chap is.Like Fong Sai Yuk Jet's portrayal of Huo Yuanjia starts off like Fong who initially is a cocky person proud of his skills but nothing interests him more than the challenge in the ring. He's uninterested in politics at that time China was being invaded by shiploads of foreigners and adopts a whole host of disciples who prove to be his downfall.Also like Fong we see Huo reeling from his carefree days get into some serious soul searching before returning for the finale. But Huo returns a more calm and measured person setting up the famous Jing Wu Sports Federation and taking on a whole host of foreign fighters to inspire his countrymen that they are not the sick men of the east.As this is much touted as Jet Li's final martial arts film it's plain obvious of the messages he wished to use this platform to spread. Scattered throughout the film are various martial arts and probably life philosophy on themes like respect and responsibility that violence isn't the means to an end. Somehow you forgive the fact that it's so blatant and it seemed to work well into the plot and narrative given that Huo's mission in setting up Jing Wu is for that purpose to to spread the word so to speak. From his early days of Chinese battling Chinese for the Number 1 pugilist title Huo learnt that instead of fighting each other they should unite in the face of new and external threats but yet to remember not to neglect the home front which he personally experienced from tragedy.But no the kungfu doesn't suffer from those messages though. In probably one of the most violent Jet Li movies it's rated NC16 here and no cuts detected except for the absence of Michelle Yeoh's scenes which ended up on the cutting room floor with bone crunching and blood spewing  you might think that Tony Jaa's acting in it. And director Ronny Yu takes his time to showcase many of Li's moves be it plain martial arts moves with the fists with the various weapons used or Yuen Wo Ping's jazzed up wire work for some of Huo's fights.And there are many fights which will keep the action fans happy. Though the much touted ones shown ad nausem in trailers against the foreign legion seemed a bit short in the final product. The filmmakers did keep one awesome fight scene under wraps though and that is between Huo and nemesis Mister Chin in a teahouse  wreaking tables chairs flipping around pillars navigating through different floors and ending up in the wine cellar.It's probably a fitting end to signal Jet's departure from the martial arts movie scene with the portrayal of Huo given the known circumstances of what happened to the character. Though there are various interpretations the essence is retained well in the movie. It is inevitable and there is no Chen Zhen character to distract the audience from what is essentially a showcase movie for Jet Li.P.S. I still can't figure out how Michelle Yeoh would have played out in the movie and no disrespect to her I thought it worked well except perhaps for the unnecessary lengthy middle where Huo was searching for himself".

There might be a bit of wanton proChinese propaganda in this movie but then again this has never stopped i.e. Spiderman from proudly standing in front of the American flag in his movies. I may not find it appealing but everyone has a right to be proud of their country and heritage.The acting is OK. Nothing really enticing but this is a kungfu movie so we don't exactly expect Shakespeare albeit Hero was case against this point. Nonetheless Jet Li is a maestro and all other opponents he meets on the ring are distinctive and complete the storyline in as much as is necessary.The storyline may not exactly be awardwinning but it is very appealing and actually quite well done giving this kungfu movie a real human feel to it. This allowed for quite an impressive character buildup of Jet Li's portrayal of the legendary Huo Yuan Jia. Historical script liberties can be taken for granted because all in all we have a heartwarming story with a lot of impressive if not groundbreaking fights to complement each other.Definitely a good movie and maybe I gave it one or two bonus stars but you just can't not be impressed by Jet Li who is a complete kungfu actor not only has the moves but also conveys the emotions.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first modern martial arts Chinese film which impressed me. Going back to the days of Bruce Lee China has never really been able to get past their comic portrayal of their martial artists as anything more than puppetry clowns with trampolines. When Bruce Lee came to America and captured the attention and loyal following of American audiences with his superb fighting skills and serious acting he was able to adapt all he knew into the visual art called entertainment. I believe Jet Li has also overcome his theatrical roots and has perfected his art. This film entitled Fearless is the result. Here we have him portraying the legendary Chinese hero Huo Yuanjia. That hero began as a street fighter but never knew much more than being a common thug out for power and glory. Only experiencing a life segment of tragedy and suffering did he finally acquire the true meaning of his craft. Upon returning to the arena he faces an American opponent called Hercules O'Brien Nathan Jones last time he was in TROY. It is here audiences observe our hero is no longer a thug but a Master of his craft and a Representative of his awakening country. Excellent film. ".

Quite literally... after a brief prologueish type text and panning through a CG Shanghai era 1910 the movie goes straight into a spectacular display of martial arts of Jet Li the little man versus the big boys people about twice his size.......A fantastic beginning methinks. However this may also be true for those people who have seen a lot of Jet Li movies I can't help but think some of the time during the fight scenes I swear I've seen him do that before.... Don't let that distract you from this film though as I believe that Ronny Yu the director compliments Jet Li's style and even adds an element of power that never really seems there apart from in Fist of Legend... which is a sort of remake of Fist of Fury... which is a story about Chen Zhen who was Hua Yuan Jia's student... confused? You should be.... you should be.... at this point I should say that Chen Zhen was fictional but Hua Yuan Jia is not.... That is actually a roundabout way of me saying that the beginning was great...The rest of the film then goes into the past and tells the story of how YuanJia got to that point of playing with the big boys... And I must admit that for the first time since Once Upon a Time in China the first one I actually believed that Jet Li was acting... He starts off as an arrogant and strongwilled man who eventually through a chain of events turns into a weak pathetic and destroyed man before finishing off as an honourable deep and heroic man after spending time reassessing himself and the world around him. It was great to watch because the progression was believable...  The film itself was well paced and well shot. The action scenes were brilliant throughout and the music really made you feel the moment. This film is a great way to finish off his Jet Li martial arts movie career mixing philosophy with martial arts as it was meant to be really. It's just a shame that some of his US movies tarnished his filmography let us please forget The One but Jet Li is leaving the martial arts world with a CRUNCH and a BANG...Go watch this movie. It is great though I didn't like the way they put 'wushu' in the subtitles instead of 'martial arts'... but that could be just me.... D".

	schema:headline " Among Jet Li's Finest";
	schema:reviewBody "If Fearless truly is Jet Li's last martial arts film then it is a fitting ending to his work in the genre. His choice of project has been excellent in the last few years after turning down Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon then appearing in Cradle to the Grave and Romeo Must Die which were both a far cry from the quality of his films from the early 90's such as Once Upon a Time in China and Fist of Legend.After playing famous historical figures such as Wong FeiHung and Fong SaiYuk he returns to create what could be described as a prequel of Fist of Legend playing Huo Yuanjia made famous from LeungKar Yan's portrayal in Legend of a Fighter and Bruce Lee and Jet Li have both played his top student Chen Zen.Jet Li uses the film to put across his philosophy on violence and martial arts which is told in such a way as to not be patronising even if it is obvious. In recent years he has shown his frustration at how his films are perceived as encouraging violence as a solution. Sadly the debate about who would win a fight between Bruce Lee and himself will probably continue to haunt him even 30 years and more after the former's tragic death. I believe this film should have a wider audience than just martial arts fans as it carries a poignant message that Jet has also tried to convey in Hero and Unleashed Danny the Dog. It must be noted that Fearless is far more tolerant than other Huo Yuanjia films especially Fist of Fury where all the Japanese were depicted as degenerate or just plain evil. Compare that with the Japanese characters in Fearless especially Tanaka played with great gravitas by Shido Nakamura.The action does not disappoint in Fearless with the numerous fight scenes being well choreographed by his extremely frequent collaborator Yuen WooPing. There is enough wire work involved to annoy purists but there are plenty of grounded moves with Jet showing off his skills with the spear sabre and threesectionstaff to good effect. The most exciting of the action scenes is Huo Yuanjia fighting against Master Chin.There are a few issues in pacing perhaps due to the removal of Michelle Yeoh's scenes but it does detract much from the overall quality and simply making films longer does not necessarily improve them  e.g. Alexander.The acting is convincing and all the characters are beautifully portrayed with few big names in Chinese cinema involved other than Jet himself which in no way detracts from the portrayal. Betty Sun in particular creates a large impact even though her scenes do not take up much of the running time. This is backed by another haunting score from Shigeru Umbayashi House of Flying Daggers who seems to have replaced Tan Dun in scoring Chinese epics.Overall this has become one of my favourite Jet Li films and I have seen all but a handful of them. The sense of tragedy and morality is well balanced with the action and does not leave a bad taste in the mouth compared to many martial arts films where revenge is considered the only option.".

	schema:headline " Could be considered Ronny Yu's signature piece";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Ronny Yu just like HUA Yuan Jia is a fighter who has conquered his inner devil. Moderately handicapped by polio he endured an isolated childhood. Against his father's kindly meant wishes for him to go into business he followed his own dreams of directing movies something for which his physical handicap makes him particularly unsuitable. Not among the prolific Hong Kong directors he kept up with bringing to the local audience good quality work in the 80s and early 90s.Then an interesting thing happened. In 1993 he made The bride with white hair which is both a martial arts yarn and a heartbreaking love story adapted from a wellknown martial art novel that most local highschool kids in the 60s would have read. A few years later Hollywood was looking for a change in the formulaic horror genre that the public had long grown tired of. When they saw The Bride with White Hair maybe because of the exotic atmosphere they identified it with the horror genre Ronny Yu observed with a chuckle. A Hong Kong director could be what they wanted to bring something new.Yu did bring something new a comical dimension to Bride of Chucky. It was not easy for Yu to convert to the Hollywood system because in Hong Kong the director is king. To wait like a defendant waiting for the jury's verdict for a randomly picked sample of mass moviegoers' report card on the test screening of your movie is not something that a pampered Hong Kong director can often handle. To see your movie reedited sometimes drastically based on these pedestrian views is even tougher to stomach. Yu however has the maturity to understand that the system is marketdriven and everything boils down to dollars and cents and nothing more. You just have to play by the rules of the game. Bride of Chucky was obviously a success as Yu was asked to take on Freddy vs Jason not an easy task as both are household names to the horror genre fan population. While not a huge success F v J was reasonably well received and a little to his own amusement Ronny Yu became an established Hollywood horrorcomedy director. But he wants to do more than that.There is no room for comedy in Fearless. It is about a person who in a most revered icon in the world of Chinese martial arts as well as modern Chinese history. HUA Yuan Jia's story is truly inspiring not only in its period significant in Chinese history but also in a more universal realm of the highest ideal of wushi or martial arts as a path towards selfrealisation very much in line with Bruce Lee's philosophy. Yu treats the subject matter with respect. Although there is a fair amount of preaching he sensibly refrains from sensationalised emotion stirring tricks. Very brutal action sequences are balanced with most serene scenes such as rice planters stopping in unison to listen to the sound of nature the breeze rustling the leaves.In an hourlong radio interview director Yu explained what a wushi movie really is  about a real life person who has made contributions to the world of martial arts. The action sequence therefore should be as realistic as possible. To do this we must have a true wushi expert and Jet Li is of course just the best one. By the same token his opponents should be reasonably seasoned martial artists. He then went on to explain that in Fearless he has tried to minimise using camera techniques but instead shot the bouts and parries with a straight take and let the actors do their job. In this I was a little disappointed as there was less of what he has promised and certainly nothing as spontaneous and brilliant as the Donnie Yan and WU Jing duel in Saat Po Long. But I shouldn't be too critical as this is after all not a wushi documentary but a commercial movie. The camera is in fact extremely well used with excellent editing putting the action sequences with the best I've seen.In Danny the dog Jet Li has demonstrated that he can act. In Fearless he brings out well the contrast between the abrasive and the humbled Hua in the two halves of the movie. The only other role that has some meat is the Japanese challenger the allgoodness blind girl is not difficult to do. As much as I like the guy particularly in Be with you or Ima ai ni yukimasu Shido Nakamura is miscast. Despite good acting ability he simply does not have that fierce intensity to portray the top notch Japanese martial art expert. More suitable would be Ken Watanabe or Hiroyuki Sanada both in The Last Samurai and the latter also in Twilight Samurai.".

To wait like a defendant waiting for the jury's verdict for a randomly picked sample of mass moviegoers' report card on the test screening of your movie is not something that a pampered Hong Kong director can often handle. To see your movie reedited sometimes drastically based on these pedestrian views is even tougher to stomach. Yu however has the maturity to understand that the system is marketdriven and everything boils down to dollars and cents and nothing more. You just have to play by the rules of the game. Bride of Chucky was obviously a success as Yu was asked to take on Freddy vs Jason not an easy task as both are household names to the horror genre fan population. While not a huge success F v J was reasonably well received and a little to his own amusement Ronny Yu became an established Hollywood horrorcomedy director. But he wants to do more than that.There is no room for comedy in Fearless. It is about a person who in a most revered icon in the world of Chinese martial arts as well as modern Chinese history. HUA Yuan Jia's story is truly inspiring not only in its period significant in Chinese history but also in a more universal realm of the highest ideal of wushi or martial arts as a path towards selfrealisation very much in line with Bruce Lee's philosophy. Yu treats the subject matter with respect. Although there is a fair amount of preaching he sensibly refrains from sensationalised emotion stirring tricks. Very brutal action sequences are balanced with most serene scenes such as rice planters stopping in unison to listen to the sound of nature the breeze rustling the leaves.In an hourlong radio interview director Yu explained what a wushi movie really is  about a real life person who has made contributions to the world of martial arts. The action sequence therefore should be as realistic as possible. To do this we must have a true wushi expert and Jet Li is of course just the best one. By the same token his opponents should be reasonably seasoned martial artists. He then went on to explain that in Fearless he has tried to minimise using camera techniques but instead shot the bouts and parries with a straight take and let the actors do their job. In this I was a little disappointed as there was less of what he has promised and certainly nothing as spontaneous and brilliant as the Donnie Yan and WU Jing duel in Saat Po Long. But I shouldn't be too critical as this is after all not a wushi documentary but a commercial movie. The camera is in fact extremely well used with excellent editing putting the action sequences with the best I've seen.In Danny the dog Jet Li has demonstrated that he can act. In Fearless he brings out well the contrast between the abrasive and the humbled Hua in the two halves of the movie. The only other role that has some meat is the Japanese challenger the allgoodness blind girl is not difficult to do. As much as I like the guy particularly in Be with you or Ima ai ni yukimasu Shido Nakamura is miscast. Despite good acting ability he simply does not have that fierce intensity to portray the top notch Japanese martial art expert. More suitable would be Ken Watanabe or Hiroyuki Sanada both in The Last Samurai and the latter also in Twilight Samurai.";

Unfortunately in Malaysia the movie was obtained from Hong Kong and thus was dubbed in Cantonese. It thus did not do well in cinemas here.

	schema:reviewBody "We checked this CD out of the Seattle library in 2007 although we didn't really expect much. I'm now ashamed to say that because the movie didn't have a big American studio backing it we thought it would be like the early Chinese wire fu movies  no plot and a great deal of flying around amidst tinsel and garish costumes. We were incredibly surprised to find a beautiful and thoughtful film. We'd like to thank all those who had a hand in this film for taking so much care. Yes there were plenty of incredible martial arts matches all different and all tinged with plot significance. These were quite well done. But the overall message of this film is to think about the relationship of martial arts to the rest of life and not keep it in a box used only for revenge and endless competition  where there will always be a loser and a winner. And judging by Jet Li's comments on the CD this may be one reason that Fearless will be his last martial arts film. There is also an undercurrent of awareness of the business interests of Japan and the West poorly treating China in the 1800's and 1900's. This is a matter of historical record and there are also sympathetic characters particularly one Japanese fighter. I suppose by now it's no surprise to Chinese people that there are those of us in the West who feel we are treated in essentially the same way by the selfsame people. So westerners can sympathize with these characters as well and share vicariously in their moral triumph. Despite the whacking this is really a film about peace.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the filming of this movie Jet Li claimed this would his last martial arts epic. That means no more OUATIC no more Fong Sai Yuk no more Hero type movies. If this is his last martial arts epic. He goes out with a blaze of glory! This movie has got a compelling story good plot development and awesome fight sequences. Overall of the 20 Jet Li movies I've seen thus far this is one of the best. A must see for Jet Li or martial arts fans.In the movie Jet Li portrays reallife Chinese figure Huo Yuan Jia a famous martial artist. as child Huo had asthma and that had forbid him to study Wushu by order of his father. Huo eventually grows up and does begin officially training in Wushu. With his exceptional talent in martial arts Huo becomes very arrogant and wants only to be known as the best fighter there is. Day and night rain or shine he seeks to challenge others and defeat them in duels. As he gains fame more want to be trained by him. However things quickly go downhill for him. He kills an older Wushu master in an unofficial fight inside a restaurant because the master had attacked one of his students. Even so Huo nearly loses the will to live after taking a life. It also costs him his friendship with a close friend who ran the restaurant. When he discovers the old master attacked his student because the student slept with the master's wife and the master's godson kills Huo's mother and daughter as payback Huo leaves town and falls into a river waiting for death.Huo is rescued by seamen however and taken to a hillside country village. There he meets a blind woman who shows him the compassion in life. Huo develops a new way of thinking and a new view on life. Eventually he returns to his home town and discovers the foreigners abusing the Chinese. Huo must patch things up with his old friend to get the money to reopen his school and enter a tournament against foreign fighters.A very compelling story. It helps us remember the true meaning of the martial arts. As for the action scenes I think Jet did intend this to be his last epic movie. That's because the fight scenes are great and there's so much variety. Jet Li shows us his abilities with Wushu hand styles as well as his staffwork straight sword broadsword and 3sectional staff. There is some wirework courtesy of Yuen Woo Ping but not to much. There is quite a bit of wirework in the fight scene on the 40 foot tower buts that's understandable considering the dangerous nature of the scene. There's more action in the first 40 minutes of this film than some movies entirely. The climactic fight is good with a twist and a unique ending. Watch it and see for yourself.Jet Li may be in his forties here but he's in better shape than most will be in their twenties. His skills are still ever so impressive and his acting skills have also improved a little. I give this a 1010. A Jet Li classic and must see!".

The factual historical and technical detail is so thorough that this may be the most meticulous historical movie ever made  certainly that I have ever seen. Somehow the stark blackandwhite cinematrography is more realistically convincing than James Cameron's fullcolor treatment in which things are inexplicably blue.  The thing that disappointed me the most about Cameron's film was the lack of reverence for the historical characters.  Lightoller my personal hero came off as an cowardly twit Captain Smith as an incompetent fool Ismay as the force of all evil in the universe and Benjamin Guggenheim's change into evening ware as an excuse to get drunk!  A Night to Remember had that reverence that was so sorely lacking in Cameron's film.  Lightoller is portrayed as the hero that he was.  Captain Smith is a fine captain who is understandably ovewhelmed by the magnitude of the tragedy facing him.  Ismay is irritating but tries to help out and be a responsible president  and when he jumps into the lifeboat well would any of us do different?  And Guggenheim's final stand brings tears to the eyes.  The drama of the Carpathia is as exciting as any fictional Hollywood action film.  This is the only Titanic movie that addresses the problem of the Californian and though Lordites will object to the rather antiLord portrayal of the events the facts speak for themselves.  If you want to be picky you can complain that the movie doesn't go into the politics behind building the Olympic and Titanic or the nearcollision with the New York or lots of the little personal stories but let's be fair the movie has two hours to tell the story of as Walter Lord put it the death of a small town.  It's simply not possible for a movie or even a really thick book to cover everything.  I don't think it's possible for a better movie to be made about the Titanic than A Night to Remember.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Titanic was to be the greatest ship ever made a veritable city on the sea moving between England and New York. Made in Belfast the ship travels to England before its maiden voyage which it makes loaded with over 2100 people ranging from the richest gentlemen in first class down to those in stowage seeking a new life in America. However a series of errors and oversights result in the Titanic striking an iceberg and ripping a gash along the side below the water level. As the unsinkable ship starts to fill with water the shortcomings of having only 1200 lifeboat spaces sinks in.It has become very fashionable now to hate James Cameron's Titanic and it is the norm now not only to prefer this film but to actively hate the 97 film in any review of other versions! I'm not a fan of the rather bloating modern film but I will refrain from making this review about that film and will focus on the one I've just seen. The first thing you notice here is how quickly the film moves and after only a very brief introduction to the characters we are underway and hitting the ice. Shorn of romantic subplots and hearttugging sweeping scores this is a very good approach and it simply lets the facts of the event and the real horror speak for themselves. In the remake we were supposed to get our emotional attachment to one or two characters based on their love for one another here the film respects our humanity enough to know that we will be touched by the sheer number who died and the manner of their death. This works much better and it is genuinely eerie to see that large ship slip below the surface to a barrage of screams from unseen thousands  that the effects are not as good doesn't matter because they are good enough and the emotional impact more than covers for them.This is not to say that the film lacks characters because you do tend to care for everyone and the film did very well in delivering little things without getting in the way of the rather documentary style form. The horror of the death is as well told as the horror of those watching it occur from the lifeboats I liked the guilt of the designer and the guilt of the men who climbed into the lifeboats etc these little touches work much better than inserting large fictional sections. With this sort of performance the actors do well  all realistic with none really upstaging the film with ham. Moore is a good lead and only at the end is his delivery a bit flat  but that is more the fault of a wordy conclusion. The rest of the cast do very well with realistic performances of fear even if they are being directed into generic class groups  simple but with the delivery of the material it works.Overall to me this is the best telling of the Titanic disaster that I have seen. The factual approach is consistently interesting and without our attentions being directed to one or two people the emotional impact is greater than I expected and I was quite chilled by the whole thing. For those irritated and put off by the sweeping sentimentality of the modern version this film is the one for you.".

	schema:headline " The Definitive Account of the Titanic Told Through One of the Best Historical Dramas Ever Made";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the Walter Lord novel of the same name A Night to Remember is far and away the most definitive and honest telling of this famous and worldshaking disaster. Flaws it may have but these largely revolve around a lack of special effects technology available at the time and a lack of historical evidence due the fact the wreck had not yet been discovered. Despite these minor quibbles the film is probably the only one to loyally adhere to telling the truth about what happened that night and it does so in a most compelling way.Unlike the smartingly awful James Cameron schlock boiler ANTR doesn't pack a spectacular special effects punch  but nor does it pack a spectacularly corny and improbable love story concocted with teenagers in mind. The producers of ANTR understood that you didn't need a fictitious love story to heighten the tragedy of that night  the bitter irony of the real events sufficed.And it is this irony and tragedy that the filmmakers brought out absorbingly well. The comprehensive book by Walter Lord was consulted down to the letter so the story is told as authentically as possible. With a great script involving mainly real historical characters perfect casting and performances that show the actors were engrossed in their roles the film really does shine. The snappy economical directing is both proof of the lack of pretensiousness of the producers as well as being extremely effective in bringing out the meaning in each scene. This makes for intelligent and gripping viewing.Watch out for the poignant scenes in which the crew attempt to contact the nearby Californian to no avail and Captain Smith walks to the railing and implores God to help them the scene where the Captain calls every man for himself then walks into the wheelhouse just before it dips underwater and the gripping scene in which Thomas Andrews the Titanic's designer a broken man waits in the smoking room for the end determined to go down with his creation. All these scenes are powerful authentic and sincere scenes in which all the various emotions aroused by such a disaster are brought out very clearly and movingly. The special effects although not so brilliant for today were fantastic for the times half the ship was actually constructed for lifesize shooting and a large model was also built complete with miniature little row boats featuring motorised oars for the long shots. So the maximum effort was made to make as realistic a depiction of the disaster as possible. And in fact the interior scenes of the ship are perfectly authentic and the audience feels that they are actually aboard the Titanic. Only in the long shots where a model was used does the film look noticeably dated.So by sticking as close as possible to the survivor's accounts featured in the Walter Lord novel and by avoiding modern cinematic clichs A Night to Remember remains the only Titanic film to provide a genuine account of the sinking of the great ship that is not marred by superficial Hollywood garbage. It tells the story as it happened of an event that changed mankind's attitudes toward his own creations and as such it brings to the screen the full impact of what this disaster really meant to the world in as mentioned a very compelling poignant and honest way. It is a true testament to British film making.As a footnote many actual survivors of the Titanic were on set as the film was being made and the musical pig in the lifeboat scenes was the actual one from the real disaster. In addition the Titanic's fourth officer Boxhall was a technical adviser to the production. And the film's producer was there as a small child when the actual Titanic was launched in Belfast. This kind of authenticity makes this movie almost a living documentary.Intelligent honest and compelling A Night to Remember is at least one of the best historical films ever made and is well worth anybody's time. Everyone is bound to get something out of this movie and indeed it is a powerhouse for anyone with an interest in the Titanic or just history in general. A totally underrated gem.".

As a device it works well and there is enough action involving the other characters to keep it balanced.Another inherent challenge in the story is that there are so many characters and most of them hold some interest. In this adaptation they chose simply to depict as many brief situations as possible often without giving much with which to identify the characters. If you are familiar with Walter Lord's book it is often possible to identify many of them but otherwise it might be a little confusing to sort through so many characters.For such a detailheavy story this is an effective and commendable movie.

Little things David McCallum fighting for his lifevest Michael Goodliffe as Thomas Andrews  dignity personified waiting for his last moments the drunken cook  they were all worth more than 100 million dollars worth of fx! You can't BUY credibility. This could never have been an American tale  it didn't work with the 1953 Barbara Stanwyck version and it didn't ring true for Cameron good though it was as a movie rather than as the tragedy! Did anyone notice dear old Q Desmond Llewelyn below decks and old BritturnedAussie favorite Stuart Wagstaff as a steward in Steerage?".

Little things David McCallum fighting for his lifevest Michael Goodliffe as Thomas Andrews  dignity personified waiting for his last moments the drunken cook  they were all worth more than 100 million dollars worth of fx! You can't BUY credibility. This could never have been an American tale  it didn't work with the 1953 Barbara Stanwyck version and it didn't ring true for Cameron good though it was as a movie rather than as the tragedy! Did anyone notice dear old Q Desmond Llewelyn below decks and old BritturnedAussie favorite Stuart Wagstaff as a steward in Steerage?";

A British production made on location at Pinewood Studios Roy Baker's meticulous recreation of the sinking of the Titanic is an utter masterpiece of cinema. The scale of the sets the ingenuity of the visual effects and the stellar performances all make this a 1950's Britblockbuster at its very best. Whilst the '97 adaptation from James Cameron is a powerful piece of cinema this stunning and melodramatic 1958 flick spends its 2hour duration focussing on the lives of everybody aboard the ship instead of wandering off to study a love story between two characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Three years ago I wrote comments on the 1997 James Cameron film Titanic for this database. Either because of the number of Oscars collected by this film or its fantastic production cost of some two hundred million dollars I felt ashamed when reporting that I found it to be a most uncomfortable combination of a historical documentary and an entirely fictional romance. I found it hard to understand why such a major film should have been split between two such disparate styles of presentation. Although I had recognised that several scenes in Cameron's Titanic appeared to have been directly copied from the excellent 1979 TV film S.O.S. Titanic I did not feel this was adequate to explain the strongly documentary flavour of so many other sequences. All was explained very recently when thanks to TCM I had an opportunity to see A Night to Remember for the first time. This is an almost completely documentary 1958 film based on a very thoroughly researched and near definitive book of the same name that was prepared from the testimony given at the official enquiries in the U.K. and the U.S.A. and written by Dr. Walter Lord.. Much of Cameron's film was also documentary and appears to have been directly based on this much earlier film the remainder was a romantic drama that was essentially incompatible. Cameron probably decided on this approach because ANTR with no well known stars in the cast failed to achieve the same success in the U.S.A. as in the U.K. I can now understand that featuring the romance in the way which Cameron did was probably intended to enable his film to create a greater degree of viewer involvement with the unfortunate passengers on the liner and so help to avoid this problem. Unfortunately in my view the documentary and the fictional parts of his film never melded. These comments on the more recent film are necessary before I can meaningfully report my impressions when watching ANTR Although filmed in monochrome and created with a much more modest budget ANTR is a film that I will find it very hard to forget. Characterisation of both the passengers and crew seemed to me to be spot on there were none of the occasional caricatures which jarred so severely in the later film. The drama of the events was left to speak for itself and this created a much more powerful film. The three aspects of the Titanic disaster which have gripped public interest so strongly for almost a century are the sudden impact on a community of 2000 ordinary people from all stations in life as they gradually realize that they probably only have another hour to live the impact of the rigid class structures of the period on the way in which this situation was handled both by the passengers concerned and by those in authority and the enormous number of what if? questions that the disaster raised such as what effect pressure to win the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic crossing may have had on the seamanship shown by the officers. All three of these aspects are fully featured in the film but often in quite subtle ways and none is given excessive weight. The camerawork and attention to details of presentation such as the creaking and groaning from the tortured ship are truly outstanding. Special effects in the 1997 film are admittedly much superior after all 200 million must buy something! but those in ANTR are quite advanced for its time and are more than adequate to prevent any serious jarring notes from arising as the film is viewed. Ultimately a film has to be judged primarily by the credibility of the acting and direction not from the special effects and I certainly support the view of the majority of IMDb users that these raise ANTR to the status of an exceptionally fine if not almost unique movie. A documentary presentation of a major marine disaster which is realistic enough to closely involve most of its viewers will never be everybody's choice of film to watch but for those who wish to see it this film will provide an exceptionally rich viewing experience.".

This point is made very clear at the outset when we see wealthy landed gentry upper the educated but comfortable middle and the Irish rustic lower classes each making their separate rendezvous with the doomed vessel. Lightoller perfectly played by Kenneth Moore and his wife represent our middleclass arriving by train. There is an interesting comedy of manners concerning personal hygiene played out in the railway carriage. This film is based upon John Lord's original heavilyresearched book a factual account which has not been compromised with additional drama. As if any were needed. Seen today it has the appearance of a documentary an impression reinforced by filming in black  white. Furthermore because the film is about as long as the Titanic actually lasted after the collision events unfold in what might be called 'realtime'. The gradual shift from humour and indifference to one of concern and fear as the realisation slowly begins to gel that this ship is in serious trouble is astonishingly well done. The camera cuts and cuts again presenting brief but graphic vignettes of individuals on board and how their circumstances and attitude alter with time. The captain stares in disbelief at the lights of the nearby Californian. A lost child is picked up by an ageing steward. The baker elects for drunkenness. We hear garbled conversation often in a foreign language. Millionaires disintegrate other remain steadfast until the end. The band never falters.In its time this was the most expensive movie ever filmed in Britain. And it shows in the lavish and authentic setpieces. Today it is possible to tell that the longshots of the ship at sea are actually those of a model though I'm blowed if I know quite how. That model was some 22 feet long and painstakingly copied. Many of the scenes were also filmed during a very cold lateAutumn so the steaming breath and shivering depicted later were unintentionally authentic. The 'epilogue' on the Carpathia now seems rather needless and trite but it would have been entirely appropriate in 1912. I think the almost endless cycle of disasterhorror movies of the last halfcentury have hardened our hearts somewhat. It's all so easy to forget in a world of celluloid fiction that this actually happened and prettywell just as you see it.Today perhaps the saddest element of this movie is that it can never be made again. The characters and mannerisms the sense of honour and stoicism arising from an unflinching belief in ideals have quietly passed away with their very last representatives that the 1950's encapsulated. There'll be no more fine fellows no more old beans no more stiff upperlips. And hopefully  in an emancipated society  no more 'women and children first'.Get a hold of this movie and cherish it. Both it and the ship are gone forever.".

We wouldn't remember the names if they were given various ship's officers get addressed by name and frankly I didn't remember most of those.Another very powerful choice is the decision not to manufacture villains. It would have been easy to demonise characters individually or collectively in order to create an easy hate target for the audience but it would have been a cheap gesture. People were stupid or hidebound that night people panicked or failed to understand. But there was no deliberate malice and that is the tragedy of it. There were individual moments of nobility and unbearable courage just as there were acts of blindness and seeming petty motivation and none of them were the perquisite of any particular group.As a piece of documentary representation this is in fact remarkably accurate. The central linking role of Second Officer Lightoller has been deliberately amalgamated out of incidents involving several different officers and other details  including the launching ceremony  invented for the purposes of the film while the depiction of the ship's final plunge is now known to have been erroneous but a large proportion of events incorporated into the screenplay are based on meticulous research.But the great art of this film lies in its use of tiny effective details to conjure atmosphere or to make a point. A toy pig grabbed a jewellerybox abandoned. A wry line of dialogue Anyone who feels like it can pray  or you can all come and have a cup of tea. A lapping rim of blackscummed water at the foot of the companionway. A hand silently slipping from its deathgrip on an upturned keel...Within its emotional compass the picture seldom or never puts a foot wrong. Every point is made quietly by implication not hammered into the audience and is all the more telling for that. The mood shifts very gradually from the humour and optimistic warmth of the voyage opening to the clawing terror of the ship's last moments and the icy drained dark of the night the pacing is almost perfect. The film need not be a moment longer and could scarcely last a moment less. It draws upon the greatest traditions of British cinema  the documentary the intelligent script the ensemble cast the emotional intensity  and in many ways encapsulates them all.".

The crew of Titanic were unpracticed in evacuation procedures but they were highly disciplined. They loaded the boats and launched them as quickly and efficiently as they could but the boats were nowhere near capacity when crew launched them. Walter Lord suggests that one of the factors contributing to the high death rate among passengers there was room in the lifeboats for 1200 passengers and crew but only 714 survived was not necessarily that the large number of steerage passengers were deliberately kept from getting to the boat decks but that few crew members took the initiative to try encouraging steerage passengers to go the boat decks. Even if a few crew members made the attempt to drive passengers to the weather decks however most passengers making it to the deck found it too cold and uncomfortable and simply turned around to go back to the warmth of below decks until it was too late.".

The movie is based on the Sir Walter Lord book of the same name which was the result of years of research he did on the subject.It is magnificently done both artistically and dramatically. Certainly the technology used in the production is dated but the filming technique actually adds rather then detracts to the somber mood of the impending disaster. The black and white filming gives an overall claustrophobic tone and puts the viewer aboard the ship along with the passengers to empathize with the horror these people must have endured.Someone who has seen the more fictionalized version Titanic! will recognize some lines of wordforword dialog and some actions by the passengers and crew. These things actually took place and Cameron's movie borrowed much of the information it used from Lord's work and this movie. None of the fiction such as people shooting each other during the sinking is in this version. But you will see the heroism of some passengers voluntarily sacrificing themselves so someone else could get on a lifeboat. You will also see cowards who impersonated women to sneak aboard lifeboats. This movie gives you everything that happened positive or negative.Certainly the story addresses how the calamity occurredwhat mistakes were made and by whom and how the crew and passengers addressed their situation. It's done remarkably well and the scene of the band singing Nearer My God to Thee is touching and heartbreaking. Objects from the wreck shown floating in the water are haunting.Highly recommended a fine movie which depicts the history well and shows proper respect for those who perished.".

The increasing despair of the wire operators. The Captain walking almost stumbling to his final post as the band play Nearer my God to thee. The husband realising he will never see his children again. The innocence of a musical pig.All these moments and others were referred to in Titanic 1998 but left me cold. They just did not capture the tragedy of it all and this is the inherent difference between A Night To Remember and all others. Not that I am writing this as a comparative study in my mind this film is the one that will stand the test of time while pretenders such as Titanic will fade from people's memories. Don't forget this film was made with survivors from the disaster still living and helping to share the awfulness of it all. As time goes by we become removed from such events so much that we can ignore the main point of the story and instead involve a bunch of kids running around with a big jewel in their pockets while being chased by some baddies. Sorry but this story could be anywhere. The Titanic only sunk once and A Night To Remember honours that event honestly and reverently.".

And her evening gown in the scene where she and her husband are seen entering the First Class Dining Saloon...looks like something out of Worth or Poiret as an aside here on costuming in the 1953 version of TITANIC Barbars Stanwyck's gown seems much truer to the fashion of the time as does the day dress in the scene where she is reading a poem to Robert Wagner.The blackandwhite format gives the film a definite period feel that works nicely with the script and actor performances. Colour probably would have ruined it. And yes I have cried watching this film as after 47 years this film still has not lost its ability to move people. There is a certain sadness in the epiloguethat so many people had to die in order for basic safety regulations to be passed into law. Hmmmmm...Lightoller. I think he was shown pretty much the way he was..Kenneth More makes a far better Lightoller so posh where he fires his pistol then tips his cap to a lady than Johnny Phillips and his GET BACK I SAY OR I'LL SHOOT YOU ALL LIKE DOGS! histrionics.All in all I give it an eight out of ten and the deductions are mostly the ripoff scenes from the 1943 TITANIC.

	schema:reviewBody "Sixtyfour survivors from the actual Titanic were interviewed extensively by author Walter Lord for his meticulously researched 1955 book A Night to Remember the basis of this stillremarkable 1958 dramatic reenactment of the momentous sinking. Obviously this lends great authenticity to this production which feels very much like a docudrama offering a diverse gallery of characters to track instead of a main protagonist. While there are inarguably impressive elements in James Cameron's bersuccessful 1997 epic version of the same tragedy most specifically the technical details and mindbending CGI images and effects this much lowerbudget British film manages to feel more dramatically resonant simply because the superficial Hollywoodization of the event is not evident here i.e. the forced melodrama heightened romance and stereotypical characters.Director Roy Baker and screenwriter Eric Ambler draw upon a much broader canvas by having the camera roam through the ship and capture the essence of the various people on board from the boiler room workers to the first class passengers. This compelling approach doesn't change as the ship sinks as we continue to recognize a full emotional range between heroism and cowardice through these characters. The other aspects that this version handles well are the specific constructionrelated reasons for the ultimate sinking and the roles played by two other ships during the tragedy. Not only was there the Carpathia too far away to get to the Titanic on time yet there to pick up survivors but also the Californian a steamship only ten miles away and within sight. As vividly portrayed in the movie the officers of the Californian misinterpreted the distress signals and did nothing to come to the Titanic's aid. You will likely recognize several scenes here that were repeated almost verbatim in Cameron's film in particular the lifeboatboarding scenes and the aftermath of the sinking. What doesn't sync up is the ship dramatically breaking in two a fact not depicted in the film since it was not verified until years afterward.The primitive nature of the special effects may frustrate younger viewers even though the thenstandard use of small models is still pretty impressive on its own. The film also spends a bit too much time with incidental characters such as the drunken baker and the dedicated string musicians. There are a few familiar faces in the large cast chief among them Kenneth More as the heroic second officer whose forwardmoving calm saved many lives Honor Blackman later Bond girl Pussy Galore in Goldfinger as the young newlywed determined to stay with her husband and David McCallum Ilya Kuryakan on TV's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. as an assistant wire operator. Geoffrey Unsworth is responsible for the striking blackandwhite cinematography. The 1998 Criterion Collection DVD has an excellent hourlong makingof feature as well as an interesting commentary track by Titanic experts Don Lynch and Ken Marshall. Two trailers round out the extras.".

The 1998 Criterion Collection DVD has an excellent hourlong makingof feature as well as an interesting commentary track by Titanic experts Don Lynch and Ken Marshall. Two trailers round out the extras.";

The luxury liner is full of people want to flee of misery for a new life in America. At the ship appear passengers from the first and second class of different social and economic ladder and from diverse ends.The luxurious cruiser crashed in the fateful moment with an inevitable iceberg that resulted in the death of more than 1000 passengers. At the finale are told the following words 'For their sacrifice was not in vain today there are lifeboats for all unceasing radio vigil and in the North Atlantic  the International Ice patrol Guards of the sea lanes making them safe for the people of the world'.Fictional and actual characters are mingled for a detailed reenactment of the luxury liner. Picture is quite effective in conveying the calm and panic on the real sinking . There are the ordinary subplots personal drama heroes cowards comedians and musicians. Story gets a little melodramatic but is added an exciting account of danger risk despair and courage. Excellent performance by Laurence Naismith as 1 Captain John Smith he's properly correct as the veteran Officer making his last travel before retirement and the Second Officer Charles Herbert perfectly acted by Kenneth Moore. And large secondary cast formed by prestigious British actors as David McCallum Kenneth GriffithAlec McCowenHonor BlackmanAnthony BushellMichael Goodliffe... The special effects are impressive a long model of big size was built for the splendid recreation. Adequate score by William Alwyn and usual musical conductor by Muir Matheson. Evocative and atmospheric black and white cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth.The motion picture is effectively directed by Roy Ward Baker who keeps the outcome of the ship tense and suspenseful in spite of the end is well known. The story will like everybody  despite we've seen many times.Another movies about this fateful accident are the following Titanic1953 Hollywoodized version by Jean Negulesco with Barbara StanwyckClifton Webb Robert Wagner and Edmund Purdom in the role of Kenneth Moore megabudget and Oscarized adaptation1997 by James Cameron with Leonardo DiCaprio Kate Winslet and Billy Zane and TV version1996by Robert Lieberman with George C.

Something I did prefer here than in the Cameron version was the music score the score here is superb whereas the music in the 1997 film is a score I am still not sure whether I love or hate.I also loved how A Night To Remember was filmed. The ship is lovingly rendered and the cinematography and costumes are lavish. In terms of scenes there are many effective scenes but the sinking scenes here were brilliantly done it had a sort of edgeofyourseat feel to it. The story is very documentarylike in its approach and this was a great idea I think as it allowed us to see the disaster at more than one character angle. Not once did the film get melodramatic but there were some very moving parts such as the events leading up the ending. The direction is great the pacing is brisk and the cast headed by a very impressive Kenneth More acts their roles impeccably.Overall a wonderful movie the conclusion is a little too wordy but other than that A Night To Remember is a mustwatch! 910 Bethany Cox".

In A NIGHT TO REMEMBER we see the little Englander mentality  the somewhat xenophobic attitude and the rigid class structure and of course the hubristic lofty ideals of the British ruling class . Cameron used these threads in his own screenplay but for some reason injected romance  action  adventure and a storyline similar to a James Bond role reversal all set during 1912 A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is different  it's not a melodrama produced to make profits for the staggering cost of its production  it's a historical drama featuring the sinking of The Titianic . While not being entirely accurate  It's far more accurate than that other movie  it is rather understated and rather bleak and Roy Ward Baker directs in an effective documentary style without resorting to an artificial Hollywood blockbuster style or having to change the laws of physics since throughout the disaster characters are reminded that the sinking ship's weight will pull down everything floating nearby  something a later film ridiculously ignored . If I have one criticism about the directing it's once the survivors are in the sea you don't really get the sense of how cold the environment is and we even see at least one character rowing about with the sleeves of his thin shirt rolled up Far superior to the 1997 mega blockbuster A NIGHT TO REMEMBER shows that a disaster movie  historical drama can be quite effective without being massively expensive .

In short they could do anything they wanted and at this point in their career they did one odd thing after another and this film may well be the oddest. There may be a parallel for it but I cannot think of any. As the film progressed I kept thinking how odd the story was and also how original. I cannot think of a single film before it that comes as close to how original this film is. I can certainly understand why Taylor and Burton decided to do it. It simply was unlike anything they had ever done before. Telling the story in a review is pointless because it is virtually impossible to actually tell it there are so many twists and turns and I think this is the one thing that is compelling about the film is the fact you just do not know what happens next and when it does happen you are always surprised. And it definitely keeps you at the edge of your seat but at the same time it is also very funny so I think it can at least be called a black comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This amazingly bizarre film directed by Peter Ustinov has been largely forgotten.At the time it was released it made quite a sensation because it featured that 'star couple' known as 'Burtonandtaylor' in it. If Burtonandtaylor agreed to appear in something money was no object as they were superbankable. My wife and I knew Peter Ustinov extremely well about this time. He was one of the wittiest and most amusing men we ever knew and was never pompous or selfimportant. It was possible to sit spellbound for hours just listening to his stories and his wonderful jokes especially in private as we often did. But Peter had a deeply serious side and wanted to make serious films such as for instance BILLY BUDD 1962 from the Hermann Melville story and this one which is a version of the Faust theme. Peter was a successful playwright and a highly intellectual cosmopolitan and profound person. He did not always pull off his efforts at profundity however. This film is chilling and fascinating and of course has moments of exquisite humour and satire but it does not really work somehow. Richard Burton plays a very calm and quiet madman who sits in a solitary confinement cell in a lunatic asylum wrapped in a straightjacket. In fact he himself affects the straightjacket as a favourite outfit which he can whip off anytime he pleases because it is never fastened. His steely blue eyes look straight through you as he asks you to 'let me out'. All you have to do is sell your soul to him. So Beau Bridges who works in the asylum does just that because Burton who is really a Satan figure promises to 'make you rich and strong strong and rich'. And he does. Bridges has taken up with a floozy waitress played by Elizabeth Taylor who is hilarious in such roles and throws herself about with total abandon and to great effect. There is no questioning the fact that Burtonandtaylor are such old pros! So Bridges and Taylor get richer and richer and richer with Burton as their financial adviser they move around the world changing identities and taking over more and more big corporations. Bridges and Taylor both play total idiots and Burton puts up with them because he knows he will get their souls the silly fools. Burton is eerily almost terrifyingly convincing. I think perhaps the script was one of the problems. The story just does not really work despite the hairraising performances. The music is very bad which is strange considering that Peter was knowledgeable about classical music and should have had better taste. Peter did have a problem concentrating and focusing I must say as it was always tempting for him to stop and tell another funny story. And I think perhaps he knew Burtonandtaylor at the personal level too well. The film is a little bit too much of a 'wouldn't it be fun if we did it?' type of project and with Burtonandtaylor starring there was just no struggle involved and there cannot have been enough rewrites and probably not many retakes either. Peter was a man of such immense talent and yet he did not always enter top gear or at least he did always remain there. Too many stoplights too many jokes. But the film is well worth seeing and is phenomenal in certain ways. Peter himself plays the doctor and is as usual very good indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "A black comedy goof on the Faust legend  not the disaster you'd think considering its reputation. Beau Bridges sells his soul to loony Richard Burton in return for untold riches. Whether or not Burton is actually the devil is never disclosed though he does come through for Bridges with most of his wishes. Elizabeth Taylor deeply tanned  entirely miscast is Jimmie Jean Jackson! a blowzy hash house waitress along for the ride. The script is not without some laughs Bridges meeting the Pope is hilarious and the acting is pretty good. Burton is suitably malevolent and Bridges is perfect as a dimwitted hillbilly in way over his head. Peter Ustinov who directed plays Burton's doctor. Taylor is OK but far too old for her role. Someone like Candy Clark or Karen Black would have been perfect. With Anthony Holland George Raft and John Schuck very funny as a not so bright Texas billionaire.".

But something sure went wrong with this project.The cassette version I watched recently was just under 102 minutes of running time but the cassette itself was labeled 108 minutes.  Makes you wonder what was left out.  I saw this film when it originally played in 1972 and could see no differences between that version and the cassette.  So who knows what went on here.

Looks about the same  even though I had to learn more about Faust later I can't say for sure about what Lloyd thinks about his sons' weird choice of scripts. But he was in Airplane! I liked both films for different reasons. Burton is at his creepy best and Liz faked Texan as good as anybody. And I'm also a sucker for any Texas movie. Watch Roadie.I Think Rex Reed wrote this review Like biblical lepers the people responsible for an atrocity called Hammersmith Is Out should be forced by law to carry a warning bell and cry Unclean unclean! I used to think Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor had no taste. Now I'm convinced they'll do anything for money. I shudder to think what they were paid for this insult to the intelligence of sane moviegoers everywhere or that they were indeed paid at all to turn out such trash but Hammersmith Is Out is one more nail in their coffin. In this feeble and demented attempt to retell the Faust legend the devil Burton is locked in an insane asylum disguised as a maniac called Hammersmith. With the aid of a retarded orderly Beau Bridge and an illiterate waitress Taylor he escapes breeds crime and pestilence corrupts the world launches wars and litters the scenery with discarded corpses along the way. It must have seemed like a fine idea in the humorous head of Peter Ustinov who directed it but did anybody ever bother to read the script? On film it looks like the hysterical ravings of undisciplined selfindulgent narcissists who babble incoherently in a d i r e c t descent toward self destruction. They should have taken one hard look at the end result and set te negative on SelfDestruct. Beau Bridges rises up in bed picks his nose and mumbles about venereal disease. Elizabeth Taylor as a platinum blonde hash slinger called Jimmie Jean Jackson rises up behind her greasy counter covered with ketchup or is it real bloodstains? This is the kind of home movie where it wouldn't seem to matter since they leave all the mistakes in as camp and drawls What'll ya have? in an Ozark accent that sounds like Judy Canova on a binge. People are always rising up into the frame and leaning on things with no movie to support them. A short cut later they are both rutting like hogs on top of a garbage sack while a Coca Cola sign flashes on and off with muttonheaded symbolism. After selling their souls to the devil he tells them One of the first things I remember is a lady with a snake as he munches a shiny apple. The jokes are about that obvious the desperate attempts at wit are vulgar and cheap. The dialogue is downright filthy and the performances are obnoxious. Richard Burton walks through the movie in a curious trance as though in some advanced state of selfhypnosis. Elizabeth Taylor clumps through each scene in a screeching display of self parody allowing everyone around her to massacre her talent and accent her numerous physical and intellectual handicaps. I didn't think she could sink any lower after X Y and Zee but an all time bottom is reached even for her as she  writhes on a valentineshaped bed with a pig person like two hippos in heat spouting obscene toilet talk in some kind of orgasmic stupor. Waddling her enormous derriere across the screen in a manner so offensive it would bring litigation from any dignified self respecting performer and saying lines like I'm the biggest mother of them all she inspires pity instead of laughs.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1980s was a period of transition as many great film legends died. Cary Grant Bette Davis Lawrence Olivier Fred Astaire Jimmy Cagney were just a few of those who left the scene. But there were attempts before the end to bring some of the great figures together. Bette Davis and Jimmy Steward made there only film together. Henry Fonda and Katherine Hepburn did ON GOLDEN POND. Cagney appeared with pal Pat O'Brien as well as Donald O'Connor in RAGTIME. Davis appeared with Lillian Gish Anne Southern and Vincent Price in THE WHALES OF AUGUST. And Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas appeared in this film.In the Oscar ceremonies of 1985 Lancaster and Douglas had come in together to deliver an award and everyone noted how healthy both men still were. It was over two decades since they appeared in a film as costars SEVEN DAYS IN MAY and some of the news items in the wake of their appearance suggested it was too bad there was no property that they could develop together. Shortly afterward this comedy was produced.It had a great buildup and I was fortunate to see it in a movie house. But it did not have a massive audience boxoffice and was gone within six weeks. It was too bad because it was a funny film and would turn out to be the best comedy buddy film of the films that they did together.Harry and Archie Lancaster and Douglas pulled off one of the smoothest and most impressive railway train robberies in American history back in 1947. They almost got away with it except for the persistence of a police officer played by Charles Durning who broke the case and managed to bring them to jail. They have served nearly forty years in jail and when released they are in for time shocks. After all they were used to the world of 194647. While both are physically fit both can't get out of their mental views from their youth.On top of that they have to deal with Durning whose police career  after it's brilliant start  petered out leaving him embittered and desperate to prove himself to the young pups who count the days until his enforced retirement. They have to deal with parole officer Dana Carvey who has all the typical problems of a nice naive parole officer. They have to deal with hostility around them from all peoples  mostly the young but the middle aged are not much better. They resemble Reggie Kray one time kingpin of London's largest criminal empire who in his later years when interviewed pointed out to reporters that while he did not dismiss his own use of violence against opponents in other gangs he did dislike the lack of respect he observed towards older citizens. He and his brother Ronnie never stood for that kind of thing. Neither do Harry and Archie here. When threatened as easy elderly targets by a gang of punks they beat up the punks quite effectively.To add to their woes is the most ridiculous but scrupulous hitman in modern cinema Leon B. Little Eli Wallach  who almost walks off with the picture. Hired on a contract against the boys back in their heyday their being in prison prevented the ever ready Little from completing their executions. Even the death of the idiot who hired him means nothing  he was paid already and he has a code of honor with his clients. That in the end the battle of youth and old age unites Lancaster Douglas Wallach and even Durning should not surprise anyone. All four manage to demonstrate that it is street smarts and brains not youthful idealism paging Carvey that will win out in the end. The film has some nice moments such as Douglas almost going in for dirty dancing with a young chippy and Lancaster protesting the slop he has to eat in an old age home and memorably showing his teeth to advantage for a purpose for a change. It was a good conclusion to the long road of movies these two cinema giants made together  and a funny one too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of course Kirk Douglas did quite a few more films after this but he didn't do em with this kind of fun in mind.Two former train robbers get parole after 30 years. Now they have to decide what to do when they get out. They're 65 and 72 years old and don't have a lot of skills. On top of that they don't fit in the 80's way of life. Their parole officer tells them they cant see each other for 3 years as per condition of their parole. They both have a heckuva time adjusting to this new existence and finally decide to go back to their old way of life.This is one of those 80's gems that I never forgot. Two great actors in their last good film doing what they do best... Acting tough and being guys....Tough Guys. Burt Lancaster is the straight man and Kirk Douglas has all the good lines. Keep a watch out for Eli Wallach...he steals almost the entire film with the small role he has. Yes you will see a very young Dana Carvey pre SNL.Grab this 80's flick and have a laugh cause I'll bet it won't be too hard to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas were inexorably linked not just by their costarring films together but by the fact that Hedda Hopper in one of her books did a chapter on both of them. She entitled the chapter The Terrible Tempered Twins and she bemoaned the fact that these two instead of being good little captives of the studio system that kept her in business had the audacity to chart their own careers. Go into the production end and take total responsibility for the work they did.It would never have worked had not Lancaster and Douglas not been good judges of the roles they were best suited for. Some stars never wanted that kind of responsibility or felt they were poor judges. William Holden said point blank after one picture where he was the producer the responsibility was too much for him. Robert Taylor was widely quoted that he stayed with MGM as long as he did because he felt they knew best how to present him and what were good film properties.But Burt and Kirk knew their minds and made their own careers work. Fortunately before both of them in the Nineties were felled by illness and Lancaster left us they gave us one more costarring part. This one's a comedy though something different for them. As Harry Doyle and Archie Long two elderly crooks released after a thirty year stretch for robbing the West Coast Flyer train they find roles perfectly suited to their age and personality.Lancaster's old and he knows it but he still wants to be treated with some dignity. Douglas hasn't quite figured it out yet but in time he gets the fact that time's caught up with him. They just can't adjust to changing times so they try all kinds of things to fit in. And then they decide on one spectacular coda to their lives and careers in the wonderful world of crime.The two men are in great form and they get some able support from Alexis Smith Charles Durning and Dana Carvey in the supporting cast. But special comment must be made for Eli Wallach's seeing eye hitman. Good thing his part is not as long as the stars because he steals every scene he's in.".

	schema:headline " Tough act to follow though weak plot";
	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't disappointed when in 1986 Burt Lancaster announced on BBC's Wogan show that his new movie was going to star himself and his long time friend and frequent costar Kirk Douglas. Since their first pairing in the brilliant noir thriller 'I Walk Alone' 1947 Lancaster and Douglas had made several appearances together. Who can forget Lancaster's tough talking Wyatt Earp and Douglas's equally tough yet terminally ill Doc Holliday in 'Gunfight at the OK Corral'? So now it was the mid 80's the age of the pepsi generation I wondered how these two consistent stars would adapt to staring together again for the first time since the 60's. The answer is brilliant.Harry Doyle Lancaster and Archie Long Douglas are released from prison after a 30 years sentence after being caught dead bang robbing a train. Eager to make a clean sweep the two senior citizens are looking forward to starting their new legitimate lives. However all is not as they had hoped on the outside and Harry and Archie have problems coming to terms with the way the world has changed. Director Kanew gives us a new genre here. Instead of the 'fish out of water' scenario we have the 'two fishes that have been put back in the water after a severely long time' genre. However Kanew also gives the audience the inevitable Clichs that go with it and is always ready to fall back on a youth versus experience incident just about everytime the movie gets enjoyable. After being humiliated patronised and generally treated like dirt for the better part of a week The two ageing gangsters decide that a life of crime has to be better then honest work and predictably they revert to their previous careers as train robbers.The film is enjoyable there's no escaping it but there are more holes in the plot than there are in a grannies cardigan and is also SOoooo predictable in fact the films outcome is more predictable than the outcome of a fight betwix elephant and duck. First of all to get 30 years simply for robbing a train seems a bit excessive for the viewer to even find it believable. Coincidentally the day the get out of prison is 1 week before the train they were caught robbing is making it's farewell run.This aside the film IS enjoyable and Lancaster and Douglas play their parts wonderfully and you enjoy the film more for their presence. Other cast members also rate highly Eli Wallach is by far the funniest character and his wonderful performance in some ways steals the film from it's intended stars. and the devine Alexis Smith makes a small cameo as Lancaster's ex lover. Charles Durning is unfortunately once again typecast as the overweight lazy flatfoot ala Dog Day AfternoonThe Sting and although his performances are always good you get tired pretty quickly of his tough talking patronising character. and finally there is Pre Wayne's World Dana Carvey as the Youthful Idealistic Parole Officer but it's a shame that Carvey is restricted to playing pretty much a straight character especially considering he is probably one of the funniest men working in Hollywood today.Tough Guys should have been better but I feel Kanew spent most of the budget on getting the perfect Sterling cast rather than to hire a good script writer. Worth watching for the final appearance onscreen of this top notch duo. Since Lancaster's Death in 1994 I've warmed to this movie more knowing it could never happen again. It's just a shame it wasn't better as it could have been much better.".

I think his character was stolen by the writers of a BBC TV comedy called Last of the Summer Wine which has a very short sighted character called Eli. So many scenes were so good that it makes it difficult to pick the best but I think the scene outside the old folks home is excellent when Leon B. Little picks himself up using the Zimmer frame cruel but funny.The ending was a bit of an anticlimax same comment applies to The Blues Brothers.".

Douglas looks great for a man in his 60's and eventually attracts the eye of a young aerobics instructor. Their scenes together are both funny and sincere as the differences between them eventually dictate the direction of their relationship. Kirk is also forced to work in menial jobs that involve him dealing with rude customers and a boss who doesn't like excons. These scenes provide the film's best humor. Lancaster's role however is far less interested as he is relegated to an oldfolks home wherein he becomes somewhat of a revolutionary. Realizing that they just don't fit in with society anymore the two return to train robbing and the film moves downhill from this point. Eli Wallach contributes some funny scenes as a nearsighted hitman who has waited 30 years to fulfill a contract to kill the duo. Despite the thin script this is a very enjoyable film that may best be viewed with a senior citizen family member who can both identify with the characters and who remembers Lancaster and Douglas when they were AList actors. I recommend it.".

Add to this just dealing with Archies day job and Harry's new life in a retirement home and their is a recipe for comedy and some surprisingly touching moments as the pair come to terms with old age.The film is fun and well paced although there are some big plot holes and inconsistencies you can overlook these as its not a serious film. Douglas and Lancaster are clearly having a blast making the movie and seeing them on screen again one last time is great.

I'm sure that while this one won't bring any awards to these two gentlemen it is one heck of a good time!! The theme song for the movie They Don't Make Them Like They Used To Performed by Kenny Rogers was Nominated for a Golden Globe however. The aging train robbers it's so old school that it's totally cool. They argue and challenge each other's decisions they chase women they make each other laugh and ontop of that those who appreciate these two fine actors laugh a lot more. I have to say as well that I enjoyed Dana Carvey Richiein this more than anything else I have ever seen him in. With the other classic actor crowd you have a who's 'who' of talent that spanned decades before this movie was ever made. As a matter of fact when some of these people were in their hay day the golden age of Hollywood the director Jeff Kanew was just a cute little baby then. But I must say that this director did a terrific job with these professional old schoolers and I'm glad it was him. These 'Tough guys' got it all along with a few bad guys and one old nearsighted hitman played by Eli Wallach that has had a contract on these two for over thirty years and he is itching to collect on it. Cause he never 'welches' on a contract. Even when the one who paid for the hitcontract is dead...for three decades now.With an array of classic songs and some current in the mideighties rock and alternative stuff the mix of style and generations colliding together make the communications and missunderstandings hilarious! The street punktough guys never knew what hit them when these two 'classic' operators gotoutthejoint!! New ghetto old rules. And if it weren't rough enough that these two 'grampa's' the gang member referred to Archie and Harry as knocked these guys confidence down and gave them a little pain to remember them by leave and then the hitman who's hot on their trail suddenly shows up and asks the gang members where the two old guys went? The members of the gang remember the 'two' tough guys and think this one guy is looking for both of them!! They panic! Break and run! After they scattered into their holes the old hitman seeing their radio blaring on the fence shouts Hey! You forgot your jukebox!! Then Blasts 'it' The BoomboxGhetto Blaster to bits with a double barrel Winchester shotgun. Pieces everywhere and then silence the hitman squints looking through his 'goggles' and complains about noise pollution. But hey! Don't let the goggles fool ya he's a 'Sharp shooter! That scene is a modern day comedy 'classic' that I loved from the moment the movie previews were showing the 'coming attractions'. This one really hits the satisfaction zone. I gave it an excellent rating because it is. The thing that offended me was Kirk or Archie 'dropped trow' showing his 'bum' when he was on top of the train making his get away although it was funny and some of the women said that was 'cute'. But that is just something I don't want to see. The two where sharp dressed men though!Seemingly I don't know too many of their generation that fully appreciate them in this 'role' because I believe that some think that they are lowering themselves by being common criminals. Or maybe it's all the cursing but I say to those of the goldenage of Hollywood generation they are not but common criminals they are extraordinarytrain robbers looking for a final Heist. Charles Durning is a good ambitious detective on their trail who comes of age to an 'understanding' in the final pursuit. They all director and actors'were right on the money' to coin an 'oldism' in putting together a wellaged action adventure herovillain movie. I especially rolled in laughter at the end when they crossed the Mexican Border. The 'Federallie's' Captain says We got you now. And then immediately Archie starts to 'School' him and his band in the rules of the game. Then right afterward the Federally asks Play by rules what rules?And Archie looks at Harry and then BoOm!! right in the jewels.Uggh! Gentlemen you made a fan and a believer out of a younger generation guy. cheers!".

I gave it an excellent rating because it is. The thing that offended me was Kirk or Archie 'dropped trow' showing his 'bum' when he was on top of the train making his get away although it was funny and some of the women said that was 'cute'. But that is just something I don't want to see. The two where sharp dressed men though!Seemingly I don't know too many of their generation that fully appreciate them in this 'role' because I believe that some think that they are lowering themselves by being common criminals. Or maybe it's all the cursing but I say to those of the goldenage of Hollywood generation they are not but common criminals they are extraordinarytrain robbers looking for a final Heist. Charles Durning is a good ambitious detective on their trail who comes of age to an 'understanding' in the final pursuit. They all director and actors'were right on the money' to coin an 'oldism' in putting together a wellaged action adventure herovillain movie. I especially rolled in laughter at the end when they crossed the Mexican Border. The 'Federallie's' Captain says We got you now. And then immediately Archie starts to 'School' him and his band in the rules of the game. Then right afterward the Federally asks Play by rules what rules?And Archie looks at Harry and then BoOm!! right in the jewels.Uggh! Gentlemen you made a fan and a believer out of a younger generation guy. cheers!";

They play Harry Doyle  Lancaster  and Archie Long  Douglas   the last American train robbers who just finished a 30 year prison sentence. A lot has changed since the 1950's as they attempt to adjust to civilian life in 1980's Los Angeles.Tough Guys as a film holds up real well due to the great chemistry of Lancaster and Douglas .Eli Wallach nearly steals the show as an aging hitman who 's waited 30 years to kill Doyle and Long .Charles Durning and Dana Carvie are great as well in this fast paced nostalgic action comedy . Also check out an early performance from The Red Hot Chili Peppers before they blew up and were still part of the LA punk scene. Tough Guys is still funny and is easily one of the most overlooked comedies to come out in the late 80's . Definitely needs a US DVD release as my VHS tape won't last forever.Tough Guys is a great comedy classic that should satisfy fans of the 80's.".

United on screen for the sixth time and let it be noted their first movie work together since Seven Days in May in 1964 Lancaster and Douglas breeze through this nonsensical fluff with tongues firmly in cheek. You will never see Tough Guys on anybody's top100 list but it is a likable time filler that doesn't particularly tax the patience.Train robbers Archie Long Douglas and Harry Doyle Lancaster are released from jail after serving thirty years for their misdemeanours. They find themselves under the eye of a young parole officer called Richie Evans Dana Carvey who is an enthusiastic expert on their previous crimes. His job is to integrate them back into society but it is no easy task as much has changed during their time inside. Harry tries to settle into a quiet life in a retirement home where he becomes enamoured with an old lady friend named Belle Alexis Smith. Archie meanwhile takes up a job in an ice cream parlour and tries in his spare time to adapt to a party playboy lifestyle even getting himself a sexy young mistress in the shape of Skye Foster Darlanne Fluegel. Neither man seems truly happy playing up to a cultural ideal that doesn't really fit their personality. and slowly but surely their minds start turning to crime just like old times. They even find themselves hunted by a shortsighted contract killer named Leon B. Little Eli Wallach still desperate to bump them off to fulfil a contract he was entrusted with more than thirty years previously. Eventually Archie and Harry decide to complete the train robbery for which they were captured all those years ago. That's crazy declares the train driver as his train is hijacked noone robs trains any more. But rob it they do just for the sheer thrill of it hurtling full steam for the Mexican border with old law adversary Deke Yablonski Charles Durning hot on their trail.Tough Guys never amounts to anything more than harmless fun. Most of the jokes relate to the cultural alienation that greets Archie and Harry after so long cut off from the real world. They are bewildered and a little disappointed to find their old neighbourhood populated by punks with attitude new technology new fashion louder music permissive attitudes. Worst of all their former gang members have grown old and tired mere shells of their previous selves. The story itself doesn't hang together believably but this barely matters  even the director and stars don't seem particularly bothered about the finer points of narrative and character logic. It's all just meant as a little nostalgic fun. And while Tough Guys is never better nor worse than average it remains an undemandingtowatch slice of fun for those in the mood for something light and easy.".

Not only did they make this film but also Stakeout and the very poor even though it was a minor hit Outrageous Fortune.Here we have Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster. Although Kirk Douglas is given first credit the emphasis is on Burt Lancaster's character Harry Doyle. As a man who has been in prison for most of his adult life and is getting old you could go a lot of directions with the character. Lancaster plays it beautifully and never once do you think that he is playing it for laughs as I'm sure many lesser talents would do. Kirk Douglas on the other hand is given less to play with. A man who tries to keep up but ultimately is pretty much out of step. He gets a younger girlfriend but the storyline is a bit hackneyed and does not contain one single thing that couldn't be predicted.Meanwhile Lancaster gets to have some fun with an old flame. Not to say that this story is anymore interesting to see than the Douglas romance but it is sweet.The thing to admire here is Douglas' and Lancaster's dealing with their antagonists which consists of basically everybody they meet save for the two ladies and one caring probation officer Dana Carvey in a rare unfunny performance. They seem to take the approach that so what if they have enemies and I can see why. Their foes are made to look pretty ridiculous and absolutely no threat. The great Charles Durning plays a cop who wants to nail them one more time but not so much because he think they are bad but to prove something to himself. And then as a capper we get Eli Wallach as a near blind and almost totally insane hitman. Bravo. This has to be his most funny performance ever. Not for one moment can you take him serious as a hitman but Douglas and Lancaster gents as they are do let him think so.".

Still seeing a hot 25yearold falling for Douglas and the two having sex all night was a little strange to witness. The major part of the credibility gap however was how unreal they made all the other characters in the film. All these two guys confront after getting out of jail are horrible people unrealistically horrible one after the other. Everyone is incredibly rude obnoxious and just plain nasty to our two old friends. It's overdone so much it's ridiculous. The world can be a bad place but come on  it's not THAT bad!The story was that people were so rotten and that life was so miserable that the two fellas were forced to go back into bank robbing.

	schema:reviewBody "Tough Guys 1986  out of 4 Lifelong friends Harry Doyle Burt Lancaster and Archie Long Kirk Douglas are being released from prison after thirtyyears. They were in there for the last train robbery in American history but once on the outside they find that times have changed. They find it hard fitting in with the current world so that's when Archie gets the idea of robbing the train one last time.If you're looking for a hardhitting drama or some sort of nasty comedy then TOUGH GUYS certainly won't be for you. I'm really not sure why this film has gotten so many negative reviews. Look I'll admit that this isn't a masterpiece or a classic but at the same time it's great getting to see Lancaster and Douglas working together. It's not like they were given countless great roles later in their careers so getting to see them having some fun together makes this movie worth watching.As far as the comedy goes I thought a lot of it was rather funny. Yes the story is pretty simple and the basic gag is having these two old men walking around and having to deal with young people. A lot of these situations are quite funny thanks to the two actors being good sports about it. There's the scene where Douglas enters a gay bar not knowing it. There are a couple other scenes where Douglas has to battle people at his pathetic jobs. With Lancaster he plays it more straight and this includes a relationship with an old fling Alexis Smith of his.The reason to watch this movie is for the actors. Lancaster and Douglas have a wonderful chemistry together and they have no problem fitting these roles. The two of them play well off of each other and they certainly add a lot of charm to the film. Charles Durning is the cop who originally brought him down and he too has some nice scenes with the boys. Dana Carvey is fun in his supporting role as is Smith. Eli Wallach plays a nutbag trying to kill the boys and he too adds a lot of fun.TOUGH GUYS isn't a masterpiece and there's no question that it overstays its welcome with the extended running time. With that said if you're a fan of the veteran cast then you'll certainly get a kick out of the film.".

A lot of these situations are quite funny thanks to the two actors being good sports about it. There's the scene where Douglas enters a gay bar not knowing it. There are a couple other scenes where Douglas has to battle people at his pathetic jobs. With Lancaster he plays it more straight and this includes a relationship with an old fling Alexis Smith of his.The reason to watch this movie is for the actors. Lancaster and Douglas have a wonderful chemistry together and they have no problem fitting these roles. The two of them play well off of each other and they certainly add a lot of charm to the film. Charles Durning is the cop who originally brought him down and he too has some nice scenes with the boys. Dana Carvey is fun in his supporting role as is Smith. Eli Wallach plays a nutbag trying to kill the boys and he too adds a lot of fun.TOUGH GUYS isn't a masterpiece and there's no question that it overstays its welcome with the extended running time. With that said if you're a fan of the veteran cast then you'll certainly get a kick out of the film.";

	schema:reviewBody "It almost seems surreal to see these great timeless actors to show up in this film years later if like just popped out of the blue. Both weren't doing that much in the surrounding years. I only saw this movie once before back in 1988. On the re watch I watched it one more time after as it being so bloody entertaining with two legendary stars one no longer with us but never forgotten especially if you watch this. I move on to the other great and incredible actor in a minute. After a thirty year stretch for robbing a train ex cons Archie Douglas and the older and wiser Harry Lancaster are released where everything has changed. They have a well meaning goody goody parole officer beautifully played by Carvey who idolizes them and who volunteered to take their cases. His character very much reminded me of his one in the zany Pryor comedy Moving two years later where in that movie all those off the wall split personality characters followed. It really sucks to see how Archie and Harry have to adhere to their conditions but as you'll see these aren't great examples of reform where soon after giving a few d..kheads what they deserve even an overweight smart kid who gets his just deserts so to speak they go back to doing what they do best robbing stuff. But they've kind of lost their touch where they resort to stealing that one thing that got em those thirty years where I loved how this climax cutely ensued. Again don't trust Mexicans. Eli Wallach is a frickin' cool hoot as a really p..s poor sighted hitman who always sees a job through no matter how long lets say bumbling repeatedly in his efforts to take out our famous duo. Just the third classic performance to complete the set. Charles Durning isn't bad though stereotyped as a once Sergeant now desk clerk who really has a bug in his bonet and big hate for these old timers. Darlanne Fluegel an always above level performer is Archie's new much younger fling has never looked hotter I kind of built up a sweat. When I think of Tough Guys I think of a colorful and juicily entertaining comedy with some classic moments that are comedy gold and lines too you won't bored. Kenny Roger's opening song is a winner no doubt and a treat I will looking forward too on every watch now. Billy Barty as a retired ex con and one of our duo's old friends appears briefly. Another old friend provides a scene which will have you like are duo in an angry stupor. Tough Guys a light hearted crime flick is one of those fun movies with honest sincere and real characters our leads that doesn't come along that often a movie for almost everyone. The Tough Enough song another version of was used for a garbage bag ad. A must see and that's the truth Ruth. How our two no three starts escaped acting accolades here is almost criminal.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very lightweight comedy with a lightweight script. But silly premises are OK for comedy like this. The big value to the film is in the actors it brings together  several in their senior years. Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas were two great actors who entertained millions of moviegoers since the mid1940s. Here they play two convicts being released from prison after 30 years.But times have changed and Harry Doyle Lancaster and Archie Long Douglas have more than a little difficulty adjusting. They don't quite fit in. Archie doesn't mind the society changes in the over sexed gym manager he finds. Harry can't get used to the rudeness and lack of manners and respect he finds all around him. This is a move that should make people think about how our society has changed in some ways that are not for the better. The film has a nice dose of action with some very funny encounters. Charles Durning adds to the humor as the detective Deke Yablonski who originally caught the two thieves after they pulled off the last train robbery in U.S. history. A number of other actors lend to the fun of this film. But one stands out  Eli Wallach as Leon Little. None of us know until the very end of the film why this guy has been gunning for the two excons since the day they were released from prison. They don't even know who he is so that revelation and the film ending are a real hoot. This is a warmhearted film with a lesson or two that modern folks might gain by. But because it moves slowly it's not likely that many people of the Millennial generation would sit still for it.".

	schema:headline " Lancaster and Douglas Go Out with Flair!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Jeff Kanew's crime comedy Tough Guys gave Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas the bigsendoff. This constituted their final film together as costars. Previously these two Hollywood titans had appeared in I Walk Alone 1948 Gunfight at the O.K. Corral 1957 The Devil's Disciple 1959 The List of Adrian Messenger 1963 Seven Days in May 1964 and the madefortelevision thriller Victory at Entebbe 1976. Comparatively Tough Guys surpasses The List of Adrian Messenger and Victory at Entebbe. Lancaster and Douglas were cast as two oldtime convicts who spent 30 years in prison for robbing a train and ultimately received parole. Life has changed substantially for 72 year old Harry Doyle and 67 year old Archie Long. They have been cell mates for three decades and they weren't exactly ecstatic about that. Now that they are on the outside they find it increasingly difficult to fit into society. Harry is sent to a retirement home in a large building where a physically fit man bullies the oldsters with a smile. Harry spearheads an uprising to obtain better food for the residents. Meanwhile physically fit Archie hits Los Angeles running and survives things until he cannot take it anymore. He moves in with a gym manager but her sexual demands and the clownish outfits that he must wear turn him off. At the same time that our heroes are struggling to blend into society the cop who arrested them Deke Yablonski Charles Durning of Sharky's Machine suspects that 30 years behind bars hasn't rehabilitated them. Sadly Yablonski is right. The old guys turn back to a life of crime and they hijack the same train that they robbed back in the old days. Lancaster and Douglas still have some charisma especially Douglas who moons Yablonski from the top of a moving train during the finale. Happily Jeff Kanew doesn't wear out his welcome and reportedly the movie made enough to break even and get the two faded stars about a million each in their pockets. The scene in the old folks home when Harry leads the protest against the inadequate food is reminiscent of White Heat. Eli Wallach has supporting role as a bespectacled hitman who has waited 30 years to carry out a contract on our protagonists. Of course if you're as big a fan of Lancaster and Douglas as I am you will have to see it. . One of the reoccurring gags appears to have been appropriated from William Goldman's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid screenplay about rules in a fight. Mind you Tough Guys isn't great but it was fine to see these two kicking butt and taking names.".

Lancaster and Douglas were cast as two oldtime convicts who spent 30 years in prison for robbing a train and ultimately received parole. Life has changed substantially for 72 year old Harry Doyle and 67 year old Archie Long. They have been cell mates for three decades and they weren't exactly ecstatic about that. Now that they are on the outside they find it increasingly difficult to fit into society. Harry is sent to a retirement home in a large building where a physically fit man bullies the oldsters with a smile. Harry spearheads an uprising to obtain better food for the residents. Meanwhile physically fit Archie hits Los Angeles running and survives things until he cannot take it anymore. He moves in with a gym manager but her sexual demands and the clownish outfits that he must wear turn him off. At the same time that our heroes are struggling to blend into society the cop who arrested them Deke Yablonski Charles Durning of Sharky's Machine suspects that 30 years behind bars hasn't rehabilitated them. Sadly Yablonski is right. The old guys turn back to a life of crime and they hijack the same train that they robbed back in the old days. Lancaster and Douglas still have some charisma especially Douglas who moons Yablonski from the top of a moving train during the finale. Happily Jeff Kanew doesn't wear out his welcome and reportedly the movie made enough to break even and get the two faded stars about a million each in their pockets. The scene in the old folks home when Harry leads the protest against the inadequate food is reminiscent of White Heat. Eli Wallach has supporting role as a bespectacled hitman who has waited 30 years to carry out a contract on our protagonists. Of course if you're as big a fan of Lancaster and Douglas as I am you will have to see it. . One of the reoccurring gags appears to have been appropriated from William Goldman's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid screenplay about rules in a fight. Mind you Tough Guys isn't great but it was fine to see these two kicking butt and taking names.";

This is a fictionalized account about how Hereford cattle came to the great state of Texas. In this film Stewart brought a breeding bull together with his owners Maureen O'Hara and Juliet Mills. The question of course is whether the breed can stand up to a harsh and cruel Texas winter and breed calves. I guess since in real life there are a whole lot of Hertford cattle all over the USA now the answer is they could. Of course in the film it involved some sacrifice in regard to some notions the women had especially Juliet Mills who regards the bull Vindicator as a family pet.Stewart's character Sam 'Bulldog' Burnett has a bit of the rogue to him but he certainly turns out to be the decent reliable Jimmy Stewart that movie audiences for three generations loved. Irish born Maureen is a proper English lady and Juliet Mills does very well as the daughter. In her memoirs Maureen O'Hara said that some scenes she states she stole from Jimmy Stewart got cut from the final print. In watching The Rare Breed tonight there were some illusions to some banter and a horse race that we just see the finish of. I'm sure that was what she was referring to although it's pure speculation as to the reason for the edit.But if Maureen was worried about scene stealing the guy who stole the film completely is Brian Keith. He plays the Scotch Texas cattle baron with proper brogue and a wild appearance. When we first see him he's a real frontier character with a possible aversion to soap and water. Maureen has a civilizing affect on him and Keith becomes a rival to Stewart for her affections. He's quite a sight in the uniform of his former Highland regiment playing the bagpipes.The Rare Breed doesn't rank up there with most of the Anthony Mann westerns of the Fifties. But it's entertaining enough and nothing anyone in the cast need be ashamed of.".

	schema:headline " A Blend of John Ford and Disneywith a Great Performance by Juliet Mills";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Andrew V. McLaglen's The Rare Breed 1966 has a surprising amount of historical interest both to students of the old west and to western genre film buffs. It is actually a fairly accurate if fictionalized account of the displacement of Longhorn cattle on the Texas range by intentional interbreeding with more conventional bulls in this case a Hereford named Vindicator.Just as interesting is the film's position as one of the early intentional parodies of the western genre. While less obvious than in Cat Ballou 1965 the selfreflexive elements and parody are there if you look close. The most obvious are Brian Keith's overplayed almost expressionistic Scotsman and McLaglen's juxtaposition of classic John Ford outdoor scenery with obvious sound stage shotsincluding matte paintings by Albert Whitlock. And McLaglen rounds out his cast with genre favorites Ben Johnson Harry Carey Jr. and Jack Elam.But The Rare Breed's real claim to fame is as the first chick flick western. It is likely to appeal more to women than men viewers as the story is told from the point of view of its heroine Hilary Price Juliet Mills who sets out with her parents to bring a small herd of cattle from Hertfordshire England to the American west. Unfortunately her father dies on the ocean voyage so Hilary and her mother Martha Maureen O'Hara are faced with the daunting task of completing what had been her father's dream. Mills is wonderful in this role and it really suits her. She is a placid observer of the strange land in which she finds herself while her mother is almost savagely reactive. Yet Mills gets all the really good lines as Hilary injects a lot of wit and wry humor into the story. McLaglen gives real dimension to only two of the characters Hilary and Bulldog Sam Burnett Jimmy Stewart. Burnett is a cowhand who starts out to swindle the two women but ends up being completed by them eventually becoming a fatherhusband replacement to Hilary and Martha respectively as well as a complete believer in their mission to change the nature of the American cattle industry.But Burnett has to come a long way to make this transition as he begins by calling the symbolically named Vindicator a muley bull because it has no horns. His reaction does not get him off to a good start with the protective Hilary who has raised Vindicator from a calf. The bull follows her around like a dog and is easily quieted with a verse from God Save the Queen. Entertaining but not riveting this unique example of the genre is a nice change of pace. Unfortunately the scenes between Keith and O'Hara will make you think more of Disney's original The Parent Trap than the film you thought you were watching.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "Entertaining and pleasant western comedy with acceptable interpretation though no much action . It stars the great James Stewart as an ageing cowboy hand who helps two English women  as he is still looking for a deep dream and blazing with determination . As a ranch hand agrees to escort a Hereford bull to Texas where the widow of an English breeder  the prissy Mauren O'Hara and daughter  Juliet Mills  plan to crossbreed the big bull with longhorn cattle . Stewart acquires a a fanatical belief on the potential of the bull and he sets out in blizzard to prove it .Amusing Western comedy including action  stampede  thrills  shootouts  fights  human as well as warm roles and a love story . The plot is plain and simple  as a widow insists that she and her daughter accompany Stewart on a dangerous trip which features every kind of Western calamity imaginable . James Stewart gives an attractive acting as an obstinate cowboy who stubbornly wishes to get the crossbread when all others believe the attempt to be failed and he sets out to prove them wrong . And charming performances from Mauren O'Hara  Juliet Mills and a red bearded Brian Keith as an extravagant Scotsaccented rancher who has a whisky bottle and a bagpipe on his hand instead of a gun  an acting that sticks in the mind long after . Support cast is frankly good such as David Brian  Don Galloway  Perry Lopez Harry Carey Jr  Ben Johnson  Barbara Werle and an ominus bit part with special mention  for usual baddie Jack Elam .Colorful and evocative cinematography by William Clothier  adding genuine wide open spaces atmosphere . Imaginative and enjoyable score by the maestro John Williams  who gives a nice musical realization  including catching leitmotif. This engaging and richly coloured motion picture was decent and professionally directed by Andrew V McLagen . He was an expert in all kinds of genres as Wartime such as Dirty dozen next mission Sea wolves On wings of eagles  Wild Geese The Devil Brigade Breakthrough and Western such as Chisum Shenandoah McLintock The Blue and the Gray  The way west  Bandolero  Undefeated  Cahill United United States Marshal and this Rare Breed. Rating  6  acceptable and passable. Well worth watching . The motion picture will appral to James Stewart and Mauren O'Hara fans .".

Stewart acquires a a fanatical belief on the potential of the bull and he sets out in blizzard to prove it .Amusing Western comedy including action  stampede  thrills  shootouts  fights  human as well as warm roles and a love story . The plot is plain and simple  as a widow insists that she and her daughter accompany Stewart on a dangerous trip which features every kind of Western calamity imaginable . James Stewart gives an attractive acting as an obstinate cowboy who stubbornly wishes to get the crossbread when all others believe the attempt to be failed and he sets out to prove them wrong . And charming performances from Mauren O'Hara  Juliet Mills and a red bearded Brian Keith as an extravagant Scotsaccented rancher who has a whisky bottle and a bagpipe on his hand instead of a gun  an acting that sticks in the mind long after . Support cast is frankly good such as David Brian  Don Galloway  Perry Lopez Harry Carey Jr  Ben Johnson  Barbara Werle and an ominus bit part with special mention  for usual baddie Jack Elam .Colorful and evocative cinematography by William Clothier  adding genuine wide open spaces atmosphere . Imaginative and enjoyable score by the maestro John Williams  who gives a nice musical realization  including catching leitmotif. This engaging and richly coloured motion picture was decent and professionally directed by Andrew V McLagen . He was an expert in all kinds of genres as Wartime such as Dirty dozen next mission Sea wolves On wings of eagles  Wild Geese The Devil Brigade Breakthrough and Western such as Chisum Shenandoah McLintock The Blue and the Gray  The way west  Bandolero  Undefeated  Cahill United United States Marshal and this Rare Breed. Rating  6  acceptable and passable. Well worth watching . The motion picture will appral to James Stewart and Mauren O'Hara fans .";

At the heart of the movie is a romance between Stewart and Maureen O'Hara as a British widow bringing a new breed of cattle to the West. No real on screen sparks fly though.  The heart of the problem is that it is hard to root for Jimmy Stewart's characterand you can't say THAT very often.  He starts out as an average guy who doesn't hesitate to steal a prize bull for a thousand bucks.  While he does put the money to good use his fundamental lack of scruples was offputting. But obviously we are supposed to root for him. Maureen O'Hara's character drives the movie when she shows up but she was a little hard to empathize with too.  She sees more in Jimmy Stewart than I did and pursues him.  Eventually she gives up on him and her original dream not worth going into that just when Jimmy catches the vision thing.  So the their relationship cycles in opposite directions.  Of course you know that eventually they will get together.  Not before she takes 6 months of in home hospitality from Brian Keith' transplanted Scottish character.  That role was a riot until he civilized himself on her behalf.  Whereupon he lost all his personality trying to please the target of his affections. Probably some lesson there...I wouldn't recommend this one. Some interesting twists at first but ultimately very predictable. If you do watch it your eyes will be happy but your heart will be left out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is dire.  Without James Stewart this flabby fartoolong cattle yarn would be unwatchable.  As it is it's not far off.  Stewart made a few of these 'modern' westerns for Universal in the mid 60's Shenandoah springs to mind and they are consistently shallow and unrealistic.    Two English beauties Martha and her daughter Hilary travel out to the American West in 1884 to sell their prize hornless bull.  They meet up with Bulldog Burnett a trusty cowpoke who helps them move their bull to Texas. Various adventures befall them along the way.    The film wants to be a comedy action movie but fails in both departments.  The script is very weak and the improbabilities of the story are just too much to swallow.    Stewart plays Burnett and manages to inject a bit of human interest into even this poorlydrawn character who has to utter some dreadful lines. Martha is played by Maureen O'Hara.  She reacts beautifully and wordlessly when Bowen proposes marriage but other than that she has nothing to do in the whole interminable film except look pretty and seem aloof.  Juliet Mills is passable as the female ingenue Hilary as is her male counterpart Jamie played by Don Galloway but their characters are too flimsy to merit further attention.  Jack Elam plays the bad guy Simons as ludicrous a villain as exists anywhere on celluloid.    And now for the daffy parts.  Burnett and the English ladies have camped for the night on the trail but their camp is as bright as day thanks to the Universal 'look'.  Somebody takes a shot at Burnett the bullet striking the coffee pot in his hand but everyone decides to ignore it and turn in for the night!  The notion that these two fragrant English roses would sleep on dirt is preposterous but worse is to follow.  The next morning they are wearing crisp new outfits both featuring dazzling white blouses  even though they have no luggage with them!  Simons shoots his partner dead for no reason whatsoever  even though he is within his victims' earshot and risks ruining his own plan.    When Simons stampedes Jamie's herd nobody notices him firing his gun or riding in among the cattle waving a yellow scarf.  When he robs the travellers the obvious thing for him to do is to kill them but he lets them go free.  Before and after the dry gulch sequence the group moves through lush pasture land.  The dry gulch simply doesn't fit with the terrain which is probably meant to be Oklahoma Territory.  Brian Keith as Alexander Bowen parades the most awful Scottish accent since Brig O'Doon  and because he's Scottish he plays the bagpipes of course.    The scenes in the Bowen ranch yard and the blizzard sequence are very obviously filmed in a studio.    Verdict  Too long too shallow ... and too bad they decided to film it at all.".

The notion that these two fragrant English roses would sleep on dirt is preposterous but worse is to follow.  The next morning they are wearing crisp new outfits both featuring dazzling white blouses  even though they have no luggage with them!  Simons shoots his partner dead for no reason whatsoever  even though he is within his victims' earshot and risks ruining his own plan.    When Simons stampedes Jamie's herd nobody notices him firing his gun or riding in among the cattle waving a yellow scarf.  When he robs the travellers the obvious thing for him to do is to kill them but he lets them go free.  Before and after the dry gulch sequence the group moves through lush pasture land.  The dry gulch simply doesn't fit with the terrain which is probably meant to be Oklahoma Territory.  Brian Keith as Alexander Bowen parades the most awful Scottish accent since Brig O'Doon  and because he's Scottish he plays the bagpipes of course.    The scenes in the Bowen ranch yard and the blizzard sequence are very obviously filmed in a studio.    Verdict  Too long too shallow ... and too bad they decided to film it at all.";

Instead of knocking Mr. Stewart for doing this movie I would just as soon sit back and have a good time watching this modern western. I must agree however with Leonard Maltin who says that the only thing wrong with it was too much studio footage. It really would have helped the credibility factor to go out more to the open range.

Of course there are some good points. Stewart finding a lost calf is a good moment but that's solely his doing. If there were other good moments I was probably asleep. Rare Breed was a disappointment to say the least. It's depressing to think that there weren't other roles available for an aging actor.

	schema:reviewBody "Since I'm doing a refreshment course in Italian at la Dante Alighieri here in Buenos Aires at the moment I am keeping up to date with the Italian cinema old and new watching almost one movie a day from their fantastic cinemateca collection. This time I saw La donna scimmia from 1964 and 34 years after its production it still keeps a surprising freshness and novelty. Annie Girardot was an extremely good looking woman then and yet they managed with the full make up of a bearded woman to almost conceal that fact almost because she had a heady mouth and a magnificent classic profile. Her character is enormously pathetic as with XXY the Argentinian movie about hermaphrodism since not only her face but her whole body is covered with hair a 'beast' a 'monster' as they say talking about her problem in front of her as if she didn't have any kind of feelings and you are on her side from the very introduction of the character which is beautifully done.She is so vulnerable so hurt obviously since the moment she was born. Unfortunately the script is very sketchy about the characters and all of a sudden she looses this primitiveness to the point of becoming a sultry maneater on a dreadful show that she and her husband organized for a Parisian night club since by now she's a sort of 'celebrity' but no woman with her upbringing could ever pull out such a bag of tricks like they say about Marylin Monroe's character in Niagara when she appears with that red dress Honey to wear a dress like that you have to start laying your plans when you were three years old!. The scene of their wedding organized by her showmanhusbandmanager is extraordinary this sort of a monkey dressed up in full white regalia veil included singing with a microphone in hand La novia The Bride an extremely popular Argentinian song at the time by Palito Ortega while a crowd of smiling Italians suffocates them when coming out of the church.A peasant woman stands in front of her imploring You are a Virgin!! You are capable of performing miracles!! and the rest of the crowd trying to touch her beard her veil etc. The premises of the script are superb for a remake. Here we see again how difficult it is for the Different to be accepted.We see throughout the film how repulsive is the character played by Ugo Tognazzi a man completely unscrupulous but the last scene of this film unveils him as utterly despicable. Magnificent actor Tognazzi. Splendid black and white photography. The music fits the goings on like a glove. The editing impeccable. Great director.".

The story is transposed to Naples where Antonio Tognazzi a streetsmart showman alights on a haircovered Maria Girardot in a convent the script conveniently skates over her provenance by claiming her as an orphan and takes her in for public exhibition as the socalled ape woman but what Maria is is nothing like an ape she is simply an extra hirsute woman no feral predisposition or mondo sauciness whatsoever she is very aware of her unorthodox appearance and never expects a life of normalcy at any rate she tries to please Antonio in their act because it is their breadand butter even reluctantly apes the behavior of a chimpanzee in the zoo.

And it is this absurdity which sets it apart uniquely in the De Funs filmography of this specific era.The direction and editing superbly serve this style of screenplay  see the scene where De Funs destroys his boats in a tantrum and how he interacts with objects which do not appear to be controlled by any offcamera prop men just by the laws of gravity and the like!

Outside those moments the movie is really funny Fufu is the typical Fufu embodying a mean cupid and rich boss. His talent is to find spots to have fun with such mean person and almost make him likable and human! Around him he finds a strange readhead family. All this happens a long time ago in France and in the country so you can have a nostalgic travel into time as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "What we generally call a guilty pleasure is a film we'd feel guilty to admit we like but we watch it anyway I'm not sure I'd like to watch The Little Bather again but I'd feel guilty to criticize it. But I'd rather have a guilty pleasure than genuine annoyance.This is obviously a product of its time that exploited the comedic talent of Louis de Funs king of comedy and champ of French boxoffice since 1964 but all the comedic talent of the world can't carry a thin and plotless story one that can be summed up as a big and wacky chase across the French coast one  la Mad Mad World with less stars and less ambition.Louis de Funs plays one of his trademark role a little man but a big shot a local entrepreneur of French naval industry named Fourchaume. He fires his redhaired engineer Castagnet Robert Dhry after his last prototype lamentably sunk during when the bottle of champagne was thrown by a Margaret Dumontlike baroness who apologized because she didn't know her strength. It's always a bad sign when the funniest gag of the film happens so early.Bad timing causes Fourchaume to fire Castagnet just before he learns that an Italian businessman Franco Fabrizi wanted to buy the Bather after it had just won a famous race. Fourchaume tries to reach his fired worker to make amends and the rest is just a series of gags involving vehicles and transportation used during the trip a running gag with Castagnet's stepbrother played by Galabru and one with redhaired siblings that is so damn silly I'm actually glad they kept it.The film isn't bad at all it actually offers some visually dazzling locations and in its own right it's a fun action film with a great mix of slapstick and good deal of escapism across beautiful landscape and there's a scene involving a barrier and a bike that plays like a touching tribute to Jacques Tati's Jour de Fte. Robert Dhry who directed the film and one of Funs' earlier successes in the 50's show his heritage and makes the most of it through the film but there comes a point where the energy runs out and even Fufu who usually carries any role seems to be as lost as us.The situations never really stop being funny but they betray a sort of desperation to make us laugh and that's rather cringeworthy as if the sights of men falling screaming or having their car cut in half was supposed to make anyone laugh. There's a sort of preconceived notion of comedy that seems outdated even by the standards of 1967. And I don't think the primarily concerned was oblivious to that as De Funs had often criticized the amateurship of some movies he's made and the lousiness of some scripts I wonder if he had this film in mind.It still did well in the boxoffice in 1968 but it reminded of The Tattoo directed by Denys de la Pattelire successful but forgettable. De Funs worked with a few directors near the end of his career Jean Girault Grard Oury Edouard Molinaro and Claude Zidi by his own admittance he felt at ease with directors he knew so he could have some control over his work. This is a film consists on the same pattern and things getting out on control with all the characters as rather passive observers it's overplaying to such a point that even the ending can't really save it.You can tell it tries to play like Oscar with the final gag but actually it made me realize that at least Oscar pushed its screwball concept to the limit of zaniness I didn't like it much but it has a richness and consistency of its own. The Little Bather is a minor De Funs not his Top 10 but it has its moments most of them before the first half hour is over. The visuals save the film but surely you don't watch a De Funs film for them.".

In real life J.B. did meet his match in the show business but he's not jealous of J.C. Everyone in the movie deserve their spot in recognition. Jennifer Love Hewitt can kick butt too.

	schema:reviewBody "Disappointingly this film was a step down for both Jackie Chan and JenniferLove whom I actually idolize.

I should have learned already not to assume anything about a Jackie Chan movie that I have not yet seen.Jackie plays Jimmy Tong a lowly chauffeur for millionaire and apparently world famous spy Clark Devlin. I always thought that if someone was a world famous spy then they aren't doing their job properly. Then again I always thought Jackie Chan always played action heroes who didn't need the help of some stupid gimmick to kick arse. When Devlin ends up hospital Tong dons the super tuxedo of death and gets to work on stopping from a water dealing super villain and said villain's mad scientists.I thought 'The Tuxedo' was meant to be a kids movie but it seemed a little to adult to be a kids movies. Then again it comes complete with kiddie violence. Few people would expect a good story from Jackie Chan but what we do want is a solid action movie. All we have here is a movie obsessed with wires and CGI and a lacklustre plot. I know Jackie is getting older but 'New Police Story' had a fair share of wire work and it managed to be entertaining. 'The Tuxedo' in unimpressive and not very exciting at all.However for all I've complained 'The Tuxedo' has a few funny moments. The scene involving James Brown and Jackie Chan as the 'Emperor of Soul' being a highlight of the movie even though is supposed to be some sort of action comedy...'The Tuxedo' is not as entertaining as it looks.

Even Saturday morning kids cartoons including Jackie's own have much greater knowledge than this!After the success of the Rush Hour films and Shanghai NoonKnights this film was a sheer disappointment. I love seeing Jackie Chan as part of a double act in his English language films but The Tuxedo shows he can't quite pull it off alone. Jennifer Love Hewitt appeared as simple window dressing for Chan and despite the miniscule amount of chemistry that did appear better than none Chan looked desperate in trying to pull of his oneliners.It is hard to understand how the script left the storyboard as it did. The plot isn't the worst in the world but the way the film was constructed left very little artistic and entertainment value. It was almost too rushed. And written without Jackie Chan in mind I feel. It's too formulaic too 'let's make a quick buck'.I am a devoted Jackie Chan fan and one of my life's joys was the fortune to meet him and to organise his appearance at Oxford University in 2000. It's hard for a fan to criticise his hero but sometimes he must especially when as in this case his loyal fans pay money only to be disappointed.The Tuxedo has to be one of Jackie's lowlights. I very much hope that the man can continue to work on good scripts such as Rush Hour and leave behind the noncomical formulaic scripts such as the Tuxedo that seem to have been written while on the toilet seat.Sorry Jackie but one I have to advise to avoid.".

The problem is that in the story he's wearing a nearmagical tuxedo that gives him superhuman powers.  Instead of knowing that everything you see is Jackie busting his butt doing his own stunts you're watching special effects ginned up with wires blue screen and computer enhancement.

	schema:headline " Amazing cast of nonactors not a feelgood film highlighting class boundaries in rural South India";
	schema:reviewBody "Vanaja depicts a spirited 14yearold rural South Indian girl who possesses an uncanny common sense intelligence which she puts to use to try to improve the lot of herself and her poor fisherman father. Writer director and coeditor Rajnesh Domalpalli wrote the story as part of a first semester project at Columbia University and completed it as his thesis for a Master of Fine Arts in Film.The film highlights the plight of the working poor an unfortunately universally understood situation of hard work concomitant with escalating debt and a systematic lack of control over many aspects of one's life. Filmed in Andhra Pradesh lead Vanaja Mamatha Bhukya and other villagers are vassals of landlady Rama Devi Urmila Dammannagari. Her natural selfconfidence boosted by a prophecy that she will be an accomplished dancer Vanaja secures household employment with Rama Devi to help pay the father's debts as well as to see if she can manage to get some dance lessons.Things seem to be going well when the landlady's son Shekhar Karan Singh returns from the United States groomed to run for local politics. His unhealthy attraction to Vanaja proves an overpowering match for her innocent strength. The outrageously common mentality of blame and shame foisted on a victimized woman is somewhat mitigated when the landlady comes to understand the resulting situation and confronts Shekhar. There is an uneasy truce after the baby is born with Vanaja sometimes returning for work. In interests of quelling political innuendo Vanaja's father is paid a hefty bribe and the baby is to be brought up in the comfort of Rama Devi's home.The remaining narrative though somewhat predictable is interesting and driven by the lead character's strong willpower. One leaves the film feeling muted sadness desiring that opportunity and social mobility can quickly permeate and make the study of caste purely a historical one.My own appreciation of the film was greatly enhanced by having access to a press kit including a beautifully presented booklet about the film. For example I learned that one of the many challenges in making the film was finding talent among common people placing ads just wouldn't work as the crew were already being rumored to be after stealing organs and body parts. So they placed ads for household help such as female aged 35 to 50 needed to care for elderly parents and gauged potential among respondents.

His sneering detached aloofness was not realistic and his entire character as heir apparent seemed totally unfounded by any political ability.

I look forward to seeing future films that Rajnesh Domalpalli IITMumbai computer engineer turned artist who divides his time between New York and his hometown of Hyderabad may create.Vanaja's U.S. premiere is August 31 in New York.

	onyx:emotionText "Vanaja depicts a spirited 14yearold rural South Indian girl who possesses an uncanny common sense intelligence which she puts to use to try to improve the lot of herself and her poor fisherman father. Writer director and coeditor Rajnesh Domalpalli wrote the story as part of a first semester project at Columbia University and completed it as his thesis for a Master of Fine Arts in Film.The film highlights the plight of the working poor an unfortunately universally understood situation of hard work concomitant with escalating debt and a systematic lack of control over many aspects of one's life. Filmed in Andhra Pradesh lead Vanaja Mamatha Bhukya and other villagers are vassals of landlady Rama Devi Urmila Dammannagari. Her natural selfconfidence boosted by a prophecy that she will be an accomplished dancer Vanaja secures household employment with Rama Devi to help pay the father's debts as well as to see if she can manage to get some dance lessons.Things seem to be going well when the landlady's son Shekhar Karan Singh returns from the United States groomed to run for local politics. His unhealthy attraction to Vanaja proves an overpowering match for her innocent strength. The outrageously common mentality of blame and shame foisted on a victimized woman is somewhat mitigated when the landlady comes to understand the resulting situation and confronts Shekhar. There is an uneasy truce after the baby is born with Vanaja sometimes returning for work. In interests of quelling political innuendo Vanaja's father is paid a hefty bribe and the baby is to be brought up in the comfort of Rama Devi's home.The remaining narrative though somewhat predictable is interesting and driven by the lead character's strong willpower. One leaves the film feeling muted sadness desiring that opportunity and social mobility can quickly permeate and make the study of caste purely a historical one.My own appreciation of the film was greatly enhanced by having access to a press kit including a beautifully presented booklet about the film. For example I learned that one of the many challenges in making the film was finding talent among common people placing ads just wouldn't work as the crew were already being rumored to be after stealing organs and body parts. So they placed ads for household help such as female aged 35 to 50 needed to care for elderly parents and gauged potential among respondents. Urmila Dammannagari for example married at age 9 and a widow with four children was working as a bottle sealer for a while but unemployed when she saw the ad shocked and completely taken aback when she found out the real motive of the ad she nevertheless took on the role of the landlady and the 25km commute quickly becoming not just an assured actor but a motherhen to a brood of young actors in training.The film owes a lot to the excellent and very natural acting of the lead Mamatha Bhukya.

	schema:reviewBody "Vanaja 2006 written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamatha Bhukya plays 15yearold Vanaja who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father. If she is going to succeed in life she will have to overcome the liabilities of low caste and poverty. I went to the film expecting the depiction of a wretched girl who is crushed by society. This isn't what Vanaja shows us. The young woman is attractive intelligent and ambitious. She won't accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to succeed and it's never clear that she won't succeed despite the odds. The acting that Mr. Domalpalli draws forth from his cast of amateurs is miraculous. Mamatha Bhukya is outstanding in the title role and Urmila Dammannagari does an exceptional job as Mrs. Rama Devi the wealthy landowner who is a formerly famous classical dancer.In the film Vanaja learns South Indian classical dance as she did in real life. I couldn't tell how good Vanaja's dancing was by Indian standards but the many dance scenes were spellbinding. Don't think Bollywoodthis is classical dance. It's also very different from ballet because in ballet the dancer lifts her heels away from the floor. In South Indian dance the heel is the primary contact point.This is a movie that is not to be missed. It will work on DVD but will be better on a theater screen because the dancing will be shown to better advantage. However if DVD is your only option then see it that way. Just be sure to see it.".

The final scene of an elephant walking away in the rural area was a great footnote to such a ancient civilization and yet human relations are still preserved and nurtured. Saw it on DVD the two interviews with the director and the main actress are very interesting. Was surprised to learn that the movie has not done well or not being shown in India ... but maybe not too surprised.

After some time working the animals she is taught to sing and dance. The film is strikingly beautiful with rich color. It is amazing what can be done with 20000 as this film was a Master's project for the writer director.The Landlady's son Karan Singh returns from America to run for office and is struck by the girl. But she is lower caste and can only be a vessel for his lust. Things are no better at home as her father drinks and eats and steals her money. She ends up pregnant and has to sell the baby to the Landlady.In the end she never rises above her caste but the story was fascinating and the acting was really good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vanaja is well done and the firsttime director Rajnesh Domalpalli apparently made the film for his masters degree! This is very impressive and he showed an amazing deftness for such an inexperienced director! However while I did appreciate the great work done to make this film I must warn you that this is an incredibly depressing filmmostly because the value of woman in many places in the world still is minimal. In this story a young girl Vanaja is horribly mistreated and while you know such things happen it sure is sad to watch.The film begins with Vanaja about 15 yearsold. However to me she only appeared about 11 or perhaps 12and this made the story a bit more disturbing because she looked so much like a child. But long before this we see the girl go to work for a local rich landlady. Vanaja has spiritshe's spunky but likable and soon the rich lady takes her under her wing and teaches Vanaja to dance. Vanaja has a real passion and talent for dancing and you assume through the course of the film she'll rise to greatness. However while this could happen the film instead centers on he immediate lifeand it sure gets pretty bad. But as I don't want to ruin the film for you I'll say no more and just encourage you to see it.I think this is an important film in the way it documents the devaluation of women as well as the evils of classism. So from an academic sense it's well worth seeing. However it's anything but a feelgood pictureand will most likely depress youespecially because it doesn't end on a particularly satisfying note. But of course in real life this IS often the case.".

Repossessed is written and directed by the guy who made Meatballs 4. That should probably give you a fair idea of what this movie is like though it does feature less Corey Feldman waterskiing than expected. Somewhat surprisingly there are some jokes in here that work the bible vending machine ruled but overall this just really feels like everyone's trying way way too hard. Especially the visual gags have that bothersome laugh damn it! feel to them they're so close to Naked Gun but just not quite. Same goes for the obligatory breakings of the fourth wall not bad but not really focused enough to generate big laughs. Nielsen's talents are rather wasted here though I must say he is about the only element that made me keep watching. It's also a very nice touch that Linda Blair agreed to do this movie even though I have absolutely no idea why she did. Not because of the solid screenplay I'm pretty sure of that. This is in all ways a subpar spoof but I reckon it's still watchable for avid Nielsen fans.".

The stuff with the preacher and his wife is so forced and annoying that it just never gets any laughs. Even worse is how the story structure is because for the most part we see Nelson teaching in front of a class and then we see the other story dealing with Blair. We go back and forth between the two and usually we get Nelson making a few comments but those two are unfunny. Nelson seems bored in his part and Beatty simply overplays his.

The film was one of the most shocking dramatic horror and at the same time spiritual since then. But much of the cast and crew suffer a lot and Linda Blair with only 12 years was one of the most affected. Linda Blair was the famous possessed girl. As i seen in an A E biography Linda don't have a calm adolescence. Since then was like a curse for her. Repossessed was like a real salvation a real exorcism for that course for that demon who pursuit her since the original film. She want laugh of that suffer she want laugh of the devil so she do Repossessed.Bob Logan's Repossessed is perfect. Makes laugh with ironical situations besides of awesome performances I love the performance of Anthony Starke. I think that Repossesed is not so simple as much of us think. Of course is silly but far of that has a lot messages The media and how have control of the audience Like Network for example how maybe the believes and religion are not so different and how we can laugh of the devil and the suffering in this way.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one major disappointing and occasionally even downright insufferable horrorparody. Ironically enough the funniest aspects about Repossessed are the trivia details behind it. Apparently the initial screening tests didn't fail just once but twice! At first the script contained almost exclusively jokes and typical situations referring to the 1973 horror landmark The Exorcist but being released no less than 17 years overdue a large part of the target audience was too young to already have seen that film and hence didn't comprehend the humor. Subsequently entire parts of the script got replaced with more general and contemporary 80's comedy for example an extended sequence set inside a fitness center with guru Jake Steinfeld in order to appeal more to younger viewers but it still failed because  well the movie simply isn't funny! Writerdirector Bob Logan's only remotely praiseworthy accomplishment was that he or at least his producers managed to trap Linda Blair into playing a mocking version of the one role that made her world famous. But even that you have to put into perspective as Blair was probably so tired of getting typecast that she considered a comical part her last resort to get rid of her 'thatExorcistgirl' reputation. Leslie Nielsen with his almost naturally comical charisma narrates the events of Repossessed in front of a class of college students. The films opens with a flashback of Nancy's first exorcism in 1973 but then jumps forward 17 years in time when she's a married woman with two annoying bratchildren. Via the TVset the devil takes possession of her body and yet again she spurts gooey green stuff all over her beloved ones. Father Mayii is reluctant to perform another exorcism because of his heart condition so Nancy relies on the inexperienced young priest Father Brophy and a couple of powerhungry Televangelists that don't even believe in demonic possession. There aren't any truly laughoutloud moments in Repossessed at all. If you're lucky you might briefly chuckle once or twice but the majority of jokes are just plain embarrassing. There are numerous lame literal jokes and uninspired puns that'll make you roll your eyes in disbelief. For example one character says The word on the street says that your career is history and at the same moment the camera actually shows a piece of street with the words your career is history painted on it. Lame! The finale is pitiable and seems to go on forever especially when the entire cast starts imitating the greatest rock stars of the eighties. Remember the intro of Scary Movie 2 which simultaneously is the only worthwhile sequence in the whole film where James Woods does a wacky 10 minutes reenactment of The Exorcist?

	onyx:emotionText "This is one major disappointing and occasionally even downright insufferable horrorparody. Ironically enough the funniest aspects about Repossessed are the trivia details behind it. Apparently the initial screening tests didn't fail just once but twice! At first the script contained almost exclusively jokes and typical situations referring to the 1973 horror landmark The Exorcist but being released no less than 17 years overdue a large part of the target audience was too young to already have seen that film and hence didn't comprehend the humor. Subsequently entire parts of the script got replaced with more general and contemporary 80's comedy for example an extended sequence set inside a fitness center with guru Jake Steinfeld in order to appeal more to younger viewers but it still failed because  well the movie simply isn't funny! Writerdirector Bob Logan's only remotely praiseworthy accomplishment was that he or at least his producers managed to trap Linda Blair into playing a mocking version of the one role that made her world famous. But even that you have to put into perspective as Blair was probably so tired of getting typecast that she considered a comical part her last resort to get rid of her 'thatExorcistgirl' reputation. Leslie Nielsen with his almost naturally comical charisma narrates the events of Repossessed in front of a class of college students. The films opens with a flashback of Nancy's first exorcism in 1973 but then jumps forward 17 years in time when she's a married woman with two annoying bratchildren. Via the TVset the devil takes possession of her body and yet again she spurts gooey green stuff all over her beloved ones. Father Mayii is reluctant to perform another exorcism because of his heart condition so Nancy relies on the inexperienced young priest Father Brophy and a couple of powerhungry Televangelists that don't even believe in demonic possession. There aren't any truly laughoutloud moments in Repossessed at all. If you're lucky you might briefly chuckle once or twice but the majority of jokes are just plain embarrassing. There are numerous lame literal jokes and uninspired puns that'll make you roll your eyes in disbelief. For example one character says The word on the street says that your career is history and at the same moment the camera actually shows a piece of street with the words your career is history painted on it. Lame! The finale is pitiable and seems to go on forever especially when the entire cast starts imitating the greatest rock stars of the eighties. Remember the intro of Scary Movie 2 which simultaneously is the only worthwhile sequence in the whole film where James Woods does a wacky 10 minutes reenactment of The Exorcist? Well it might be crude and vulgar but that scene is much funnier and more effective as this dud.";

The problem with this movie it was a bit too corny and cheesy at times and a lot of the jokes were unfunny and the middle half is kinda dull with hardly any laughs what so ever until it starts to get tolling in the finale. as for gore and violence nothing but green pea soup vomit that goes all over everybody other then that not a thing. there are lots of things to laugh at in this movie Leslie Nielsen will have you on the floor and lots of other cool jokes. The Acting isn't that good but everyone seems to be having a good time. Linda Blair is very pretty and seems to be having tons of fun here she is hilarious as well and did her job very well. Leslie Nielsen is HILARIOUS here as he always is and had me on the floor. Ned Beatty is amusing here in his limited screen time. Anthony Starke is great here as the other priest and plays it straight nice job!!!!. Overall well worth a rental on a rainy night 12 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I'm nuts I like this movie with its silly plot lame jokes and bad ripoffs but then isn't that the case. Whenever a bad movie like this one or Mafia! has enough scenes to cater to a small faction it becomes a cult film. I love this movie as a horror comedy but it could be better enjoyed by more people seeing it on video than by the jokers at Comedy Central who edited out all the naughty scenes. Heck those chowderheads canceled MST3K for crying out loud ! It is weird seeing Linda Blair playing her old role again after all these years or Robert Fuller the doctor from Emergency! once more but Leslie Neilsen is loving it as he plays Father Mayii the clerical Frank Drebin. Anthony Starke plays his role almost deadpan throughout but Ned Beatty is hilarious as he gets most of the best scenes. The PMS jokes are way overused and the Benny Hill inflatable breasts joke makes a cameo in my favorite scene on an uncredited actress named Sara Matthews. Several of the other roles are forgettable except perhaps for Nancy's clueless husband or Jake Steinfeld the exercise instructor who plays his role as if this was a straight part in the original Exorcist. There are some jokes the film could have done or weren't daring enough to use such as the bra gag in any of Blair's possessed scenes but was it really necessary to have Gene Okerlund and Jesse Venturathe future Wisconsin governor critique the exorcism ? Maybe sobut their comments were a little distracting and the shapeshifting between Mayii and Blair quite a bit tagged on. Still this movie does have some big laughs but obviously not enough or this would have been shown theatrically. I do consider this movie as deserving at least eight stars in my book but for the DVD version I'm voting five points on it for something the VHS version has the DVD doesn't CloseCaptioning.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a fan of the parody subgenre and of course the horror genre mixing both of them together really can make a beautiful combination. I'm probably going to be in the minority on this but I personally think this is another under the radar gem. This film believe it or not was one of the first parody films I've seen and it was also the first film with Lesile Nelson I've seen before the Naked Gun films.This to me is one of those parodies done right because it really feels like it's doing it's own thing which is what a good working parody should do. And yeah sure it's not on the same level as the Naked Gun films first and second to be precise or any other A level parody film out there but it's not trying to be it's just trying to be plain fun.This film is an obvious jab to The Exercist and I think it's a very solid hit that leaves a mark. Not much I can really say about this film I really like some of the physical sight gags which really made me chuckle like one really suttle one was seeing a bible vending machine which I don't think is too far off with the vending machines we have now where some sell random jewelry and romance novels. But of course there was that rocky like montage sequence where we see Mayii train and gear up for the exorcism which I thought was funny and cool since I'm a fan of the Rocky films and I even like the lunch box that Mayii brings I'll give you a hint it's another Stalone action film. That's one of the best things about the film it kinda homages Stalone's films a lot the writer must've been a Stalone fan.Even some of the verbal gags are funny like the jabs on PMS you got to admit whenever the female populace goes though it they do act like their possessed. Or my favorite line Freeze puke face! The characters are really solid and a lot of fun. I really like subordinate villain Ernest Weller played by Ned Beatty whom is pretty much just a sleaze con artist that is cheating viewers out of their money with his church program and of course the devil possession situation is just another opportunity for money and ratings. It's obviously a parody on some of the TV church scams that were going on .But of course the main villain the Devil is the spotlight villain played well by Linda Blair which is ironic since she was in The Exercist. What really makes this version stand out for me is the scheme The Devil has which is to influence and create more followers by using the power of media. That's another thing the film does is it parodies on the issue of media manipulation.And the protagonists are also great. Anthony Stark as Father Luke is funny because he's good natured and always means to help but is always insecure he's got some good lines.But the highlight of course of the whole film is Lesile Nielsen whom plays Father Mayii. I like his last name which is obviously two words run together. Not much to say for his character Lesile as usual plays it straight as a good natured priest whom has became retired and reluctant due to the post trauma he's suffered from the last exorcism he's done. Which of course all the more wants you to win hoping he'll find the courage and strength again. But other than that his character is hilarious he's got some great lines even some sight gags as well. Like seeing him watch a telethon of Weller's crooked Chirch program and he is expressing constant distaste and wearing a bunch of random masks to numb the pain of the program though Mayii could've just turned to another channel but I guess nothing else was on and he didn't have cable.The exorcism which to me is the real highlight of this film. It was just hilarious just seeing Luke and Mayii just do their jobs while the Devil was just giving them more and more grief. Let alone seeing a cameo by Jesse Ventura and Gene do a wrestling cometary on the exorcism which really added to the humor more because I was a bit of a fan of the WWF at the time the 80's and early 90's when WWF was actually still good.What all three of them go though in the exorcism is just really random and crazy almost like one big skit show. I won't give away too much two of my favorite moments were seeing the Devil just turn both Mayii into just random things and Luke is going along with it. Or even the Devil with a Blue Dress number which I thought was a lot of fun since I like that song.The only bad things about the film for me are that I do thing the middle of the film is just a bit on the slow side but of course things pick back up around the third and final half so I can't complain too much. And of course some of the visual jokes as well as a few sight gags are kinda lame but same could be said for a lot of other comedies out there and there are more than enough hits to keep you satisfied.If your a fan of the parody subgenere as well as Lesile Neilson then I recommend giving this film a try it's devilish fun.Rating 3 stars".

	schema:headline " A forgettable hit and miss comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Father Mayii exorcised a possessed child named Nancy 17 year's ago but now she is repossessed while watching the TV. So Father Brophy tries to get Father Mayii out of retirement to help him perform Nancy's exorcism and also it's going to be played on live TV to boost ratings for some hasbeens.This a reasonably okay spoof on 'The Exorcist' that has it fair share of hits and misses led by Leslie Nielsen as the head priest and the one who is telling the story about the repossession to a class of students. The film itself isn't great as a whole as you got a couple good scenes and oneliners that standout from the rest but you got a couple scenes and lines that are incredibly in bad taste or just lame.One thing I noticed that some gag's were borrowed in the opening sequence of the awfully bad Scary Movie 2 with the 'The Exorcist' part being the only amusing thing about that movie.The story itself is weak and really of no importance as it's the gags that are the main attraction with one gag or joke after another though some of the gags start getting really tiresome and repetitive halfway through the film. So because of the oneidea film it drags towards the end making it feel longer than its 80minsrunning time.The performances are nothing special Leslie Nielsen has most of the funny parts as the retired Father Jebedaiah Mayii who makes a comeback to face his old demons in many amusing ways and also Ned Betty as Ernest Weller has his comical moments as the TV host. Linda Blair reprises her role that made her big but this time mocking her performance in 'The Exorcist' as the possessed women named Nancy Aglet while she was quite funny at first especially with the hilarious scenes involving her family but after a while it got kind of stale and Anthony Starke plays the young unexperienced Father Luke Brophy who is basically wooden and is pretty light of the laughs.This is worth a look if you want to see a stupid mockery of a classic film but still it's quite forgettable and if you want a good comedy in the same vein with Leslie Nielsen watch the Naked Gun films instead.25".

So Father Brophy tries to get Father Mayii out of retirement to help him perform Nancy's exorcism and also it's going to be played on live TV to boost ratings for some hasbeens.This a reasonably okay spoof on 'The Exorcist' that has it fair share of hits and misses led by Leslie Nielsen as the head priest and the one who is telling the story about the repossession to a class of students. The film itself isn't great as a whole as you got a couple good scenes and oneliners that standout from the rest but you got a couple scenes and lines that are incredibly in bad taste or just lame.One thing I noticed that some gag's were borrowed in the opening sequence of the awfully bad Scary Movie 2 with the 'The Exorcist' part being the only amusing thing about that movie.The story itself is weak and really of no importance as it's the gags that are the main attraction with one gag or joke after another though some of the gags start getting really tiresome and repetitive halfway through the film. So because of the oneidea film it drags towards the end making it feel longer than its 80minsrunning time.The performances are nothing special Leslie Nielsen has most of the funny parts as the retired Father Jebedaiah Mayii who makes a comeback to face his old demons in many amusing ways and also Ned Betty as Ernest Weller has his comical moments as the TV host. Linda Blair reprises her role that made her big but this time mocking her performance in 'The Exorcist' as the possessed women named Nancy Aglet while she was quite funny at first especially with the hilarious scenes involving her family but after a while it got kind of stale and Anthony Starke plays the young unexperienced Father Luke Brophy who is basically wooden and is pretty light of the laughs.This is worth a look if you want to see a stupid mockery of a classic film but still it's quite forgettable and if you want a good comedy in the same vein with Leslie Nielsen watch the Naked Gun films instead.25";

The gags should flow naturally but lines are delivered purely so that a gag can be bolted on after it and worst of all you know when the gags are coming even down to the point when the main character is introduced as Father Mayii you know that a Father Mayii Yes you may line can only be minutes away.

But a long time ago Nancy was possessed by the devil and she was exorcised by a kind priest Father Jebedaiah Mayii Leslie Nielsen. Now after all these years when Nancy lived the good life... then suddenly she's repossessed again after 17 years ago when she's watching TV with her family. Now the possessed Nancy wants Father Mayii to battle with him again and to see if Father Mayii still got what it takes to remove the demon out of her. Since Father Mayii is too old to fight this demon again he's getting help from a young inexperience priest Father Luke Brophy Anthony Starke. But when Father Brophy tells the Church there's a possessed woman the Church thinks it would be best if it's televised with the association of a sleazy televangelist Ned Beatty and his wife Lana Schwab hoping to get millions from the ratings and of course... donations to the Chruch and stealing money from the donations by the televangelist by making himself richer. But the situation goes way out of control on live TV and the possessed demon is hoping to get people possessed by other demons for those who watched the TV special. Now Father Mayii and Father Brophy are forced to fight with this demon before it's gets away by controlling the world.Written and Directed by Bob Logan Meatballs 4 Up Your Alley made an not so successful spoof to the classic horror movies of all time The Exorcist with Blair making fun of her own OscarNominated role. The problem with the film while it is watchable. While the directing and the script by the director isn't always successful. There's some terrible acting at times and some unsuccessful gags are supposed to hit the mark. Which Logan is certainly not the right writer or director to make this kind of spoof. But Logan does tries hard for it and he goes some points for it. But it's Blair Nielsen and Starke makes its somewhat enjoyable if forgettable movie fun to watch and they give their 110 . Blair still certainly looks great with that demonic possession look and it looks almost as good but different than the original MakeUp look that it was design by OscarWinnerDick Smith. Repossessed is certainly a curiosity movie nothing more with good comedic performances by the leads some good visual gags and amusing cameos. If you want to see Blair having a blast with this role it is worth a look at least once.  .".

Yes you are correct the puke  the cursing spinning head moving bed the sexual insinuations and of course the ritual. The writers of this movie got their facts straight from The Exorcist and adding more spoofs not necessary Horror was a good idea. Back in the time spoof movies were directed to a huge audience and that's why most of them are rated PG13. It wasn't until the new millennium with the Wayans brothers Scary Movie that Horror spoofs took a new direction and landed a Rrating. But back in the early 90's humor was more naive and cheesy. If you enjoyed and worship The Exorcist like me you will mostly like Repossessed although it isn't a brilliant spoof by any means. Although the movie is very dated it manages to entertain. My favorite scene includes Leslie Nielsen the GREAT Leslie training for the exorcism. This man is a genius. Also Linda Blair is good on her role. It makes me sad that she had a brilliant future but she didn't pick the right projects.TAKE MY WORD Watch The Exorcist parody from Scary Movie 2 2001 it's ten times better and and it spoofs the movie in a more perverse way. Repossessed gets a 610 in my opinion mainly because it tried toO hard. How lame was comedy at the early 90's?!".

She makes this insecure emotionally frightened selfdeluded yet domineering woman a sympathetic figure in the end. Burt Lancaster is a bit over the top but the role calls for it. A fascinating aspect is the parallel development of the daughter's budding sexuality with the release of her mother's longsuppressed yearnings.

Magnani landed the film version after Maureen Stapleton had originated the part on Broadway and she is terrific as the smouldering Italian woman whose husband is killed when he is caught smuggling. The Tennessee Williams play touches on the usual ingredients of sexual repression and denial and hypocrisy. After years of mourning the dead husband the Baron Magnani finally gives in to sexual urges with Lancaster only after the swarm of village women a pack of Italian harpy hags that acts as a Greek Chorus convince her that the husband had been unfaithful. The subplot involves the purity of the daughter who is dating an equally pure sailor Marisa Pavan and Ben Cooper. The subplot is boring. Lancaster is good as the simpleton truck driver who serves as the double for the dead husband right down to the rose tattoo on his chest. Another rose tattoo shows up on the chest of the husband's floozie girl friend nicely played by Virginia Grey which serves as the proof Magnani needs to finally believe her husband's cheating. Lots of symbolism and circular plots but the bottom line is the excellence of the acting. Magnani won a welldeserved Oscar for this film. Her scenes with Lancaster are electric. And Van Fleet is super as the shrieking customer Magnani is a seamstress it's no coincidence that Van Fleet won the supporting actress Oscar that year for East of Eden since her performance in The Rose Tattoo is a world apart from that film. And yes Tennessee Williams can be glimpsed as a barfly at the Mardi Gras Club.".

It contains the performance of a lifetime by Anna Magnani who won an Academy Award for it. The supporting cast also give excellent performances. It even has a fine score written by noted composer Alex North.Magnani grabs hold of the role of Serafina Delle Rose and wrings everything she can out of it. She plays a lonely widow who is clinging to the idealized memory of her husband. She has little use for men and not much more for women until Burt Lancaster playing an earthy truck driver comes along and brings her back to life. Their courtship is swift and tempestuous.Director Daniel Mann does a good job of making a movie out of what was once a play only a few times do things get so wordy that you are reminded of the work's origin. Lancaster is fine in his role but his character might be just a bit too broadly drawn. I was impressed with actress Marisa Pavan as Serafina's daughter though she looks closer to 25 than the age of 15 the script says she is not a unique occurrence in films. Her story also seems a little truncated compared to her mother's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ten out of ten for Anna Magnani's tourdeforce performance in The Rose Tattoo but the film itself falls a notch or two below that level. From time to time a performance comes along that is so brilliant that the work of all other actors in the same year pales in comparison. Ben Kingsley in Gandhi and Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot come to mind and Anna Magnani as Serafina Delle Rose in The Rose Tattoo can be added to that short list. The actress seems to physically transform herself before your eyes from a depressed selfpitying widow who has been swallowed by grief over the death of the husband that she worshiped into a flirtatious earthy woman who cannot resist the attention and physical attraction of Alvaro a truck driver who is played by Burt Lancaster. Unfortunately Lancaster who often overacted when there was not a strong director to control him lets loose at times in a nearly buffoonish performance as the suitor. Fortunately nearly half the movie passes before he arrives on screen. Since Lancaster is capable of subtle restrained work such as that in Atlantic City and Field of Dreams one can only fault director Daniel Mann for not reining in the actor's overthetop gestures and shameless mugging.The original Tennessee Williams play has been effectively opened up and only occasionally betrays its stage origins. James Wong Howe's blackandwhite cinematography beautifully captures the atmospheric art direction and two of the film's three Academy Awards deservedly went to the cinematographer and art director. The third of course was presented to Anna Magnani. The film has some dry stretches Marisa Pavan is obviously much older than the 15 that she portrays and Lancaster is definitely miscast which was possibly a studio decision for marquee value. However despite its flaws The Rose Tattoo remains a worthy film for its Tennessee Williams lines and the brilliance of Magnani's performance. Unfortunately the great Italian actress made far too few films and died much too young so film lovers should relish this diamondcaliber performance even if its setting is only goldplated. .".

It was with her in mind he wrote The Rose Tattoo but she never played it in the theater because she didn't feel too comfortable at the time in doing the play in English.Anna Magnani was born to play Serafina she smolders the screen every time we see her. She is the sole reason for watching the film. Daniel Mann miscalculated in the adaptation by Hal Kanter of the play he had directed on Broadway and it shows. The basic failure is that he made the character of Alvaro Mangiacavallo into a buffoon. Burt Lancaster seems to have been directed to go for laughs rather than being the sensual man he is in the play. He must awaken Serafina from the self imposed mourning she is experiencing at the time they meet.The Rose Tattoo has a Greek tragedy feeling. Watch Serafina at the beginning of the film shopping at the grocery store among the neighborhood women. Later the same thing happens. At the most dramatic moments the chorus comes to surround Serafina it's a ploy to make her react to them and vent her anger at the ignorant women who are her neighbors and clients but not her real friends.Serafina is a dignified woman who is still living back in Sicily even though she is now in New Orleans. Her daughter rebels against her mother who can't understand the American ways. When her husband Rosario dies her whole world falls apart. Rosario has been the only man in her life and she wants to stay at home and not face reality until the appearance of Alvaro who manages to win her over with his simple ways.Anna Magnani gives a performance that is larger than life.".

	schema:reviewBody "It ain't easy to steal the spotlight from Burt Lancaster but Anna Magnani in her Oscar winning performance managed to do just that. Of course it helps to have the female role be the protagonist here.In the 1951 season on Broadway Tennessee Williams's The Rose Tattoo came to Broadway and ran for 306 performances and starred Maureen Stapleton and Eli Wallach in the Magnani and Lancaster parts. Like all of Tennessee Williams's work it is set in the south but a different kind of south than we usually see. Surely Serafina Derosse is a lot different than decadent southerners like Blanche Dubois or Alexandra Del Lago or Violet Venable. She's from a different world than they being an immigrant. She brings her culture and its values to the gulf area. Serafina's husband is killed in a brief prologue in a car crash he's a truck driver who does a little smuggling on the side. He also does a bit of womanizing on the side as well which comes out at his death. As a result Magnani just withdraws from the world and even tries to turn her daughter Marisa Pavan into as a bitter a creature as she is.Enter Burt Lancaster into her life who's also a truck driver. His is a pretty expansive role also but he's just not in the same league as Magnani few are. Burt was cast in the role because Paramount wanted some box office name as Magnani was not known in this country though she was Italy's biggest female star.In a recent biography of Burt Lancaster it said that Lancaster was lucky in this part because he grew up in East Harlem one of the few WASP types there and had many Italian immigrant friends and their families to draw upon for his character. It's a good performance Lancaster stops well short of making it a cartoon creation and getting the Italian American Civil Rights group down on him.Still it's Magnani's picture and she dominates it thoroughly. She did only a few English language films after this Wild is the Wind and The Secret of Santa Vittoria with Anthony Quinn and The Fugitive Kind with Marlon Brando among them. Brando in fact turned down this film because he was afraid she'd upstage him. Guess he got his courage later on.The Rose Tattoo is probably the closest Tennessee Williams came to doing a comedy. It's well short of a comedy there's too many serious parts to this film to consider it that. Still I think it's something different from Tennessee Williams something unique and something wonderful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though this film and it's story seems to be having a hard time holding up through the course of time it does possess one terrific performance that even today film buffs talk about. Story is about an Italian woman in Louisiana named Serafina Delle Rose Anna Magnani who becomes a widow when her husband is killed trying to smuggle goods in a truck. The rumors start to spread in her neighborhood that her husband had a mistress but she ignores the talk and withdraws into her home rarely going outdoors. She keeps a close watch on her teenage daughter Rosa Marisa Pavan but she falls in love with a sailor named Jack Hunter Ben Cooper so Serafina makes him promise not to touch her Innocence. SPOILER ALERTOne day Serafina meets Alvaro Mangiacavallo Burt Lancaster who's a truck driver and very open about looking for a nice woman to be with.  They talk and seem to get along but he's not very sophisticated and when she finds out that he had a rose tattoo put on his chest like her late husband she wants to kick him out. But instead she makes him take her to where her husband's mistress works so she can confront her. Serafina discovers that she also has a rose tattoo on her and this makes her come to grips about her husbands infidelity. This film was directed by Daniel Mann from Tennessee Williams play and Williams wrote the story with Magnani in mind for the play but she declined because of her lack of English. Mann had directed the play and when it was certain to be made into a film everyone managed to convince Magnani to take the role. She had learned some English during this time and had a coach on the set of this film to help her. This is another steamy Williams story and like most of his stories it's a drama set in a hot part of the country. It wouldn't be a Tennessee Williams story without the actors sweating bullets as they pour their heart out. Lancaster has been criticized for his performance and it's a role that seemed perfect for someone else. One of his greatest attributes as an actor was how powerful he could come across without being overly animated. Here his character Alvaro is a complete slob and a clumsy one at that. I was never convinced that Magnani's character would ever find him to be more than a friend if that. But easily this is a film where you just sit back and marvel at the performance of Magnani. She had become a big theater actress in Italy but was relatively unknown here in America. She's perfect for her role and I cannot think of another actress that could have done a better job. Magnani could expose every thought and emotion on screen and make every viewer know what she's feeling at every moment. She was over the top but gloriously so. This is a case where a film and a performance needed an actress to go to another level to make the role her own. She not only does this but she took total command of her role in a way that very few actors have ever done. Magnani won the Academy Award for her performance and her win has stood the test of time. One of the overlooked things in this film is the performance of Pavan. This was one of the few good roles she had in her career but she was well cast as Magnani's daughter. More than once she got the better of the scenes when her character Rosa had to stand up to her mother. Good adaptation from Williams story make this an interesting film to watch and Magnani is a marvel to watch.".

I must admit that I was disappointed by Lancaster's overacting and the minor actors also were not at all impressive. Also I do not feel inspired to read the play itself because I don't think that reading it could compare to watching Magnani's riveting performance through which Magnani's soul itself seems to bleed.Although I cannot think of another film with such an engaging actress the beginning tone and ambiance of this film reminded me of other Tennessee Williams works. The atmosphere is open naked and almost frightening Williams's plays always introduce characters that are very humanweak lonely unsettledand deeply passionate. He doesn't take care to hide the frightening and desperate side of people even though we may not want to see that. He makes no exception in this piece and this sense of humanity is most effectively portrayed through Magnani.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think in many ways it's hard to see and appreciate The Rose Tattoo today. While in 1955 it was a hit and earned Anna Magnani the Oscar for Best Actress to me today her performance seemed incredibly broad and overdone. At the time people marveled at her earthiness and intensitynow many would see this as overacting. To put it very bluntly she screamed ranted and acted more like a cow in extreme need of a csection instead of a real person! Subtle her performance wasn't!As for the story it has some interesting elements and if the director had pushed for a slower and more restrained performance I would have enjoyed it immensely. It begins with a man getting killed while being chased by police. He was a smuggler and he left a wife Magnani and daughter. Since his death the wife has gotten in a rutfeeling sorry for herself behaving horribly towards everyone around her and trying to convince herself that her husband was a much better man than he really was. However no matter how hard she tries to distract herself by screaming and being unpleasant these actions can't suffice to distract her completelyshe worries that what neighbors say is correcther husband had been cheating on her. As a result she cycles between extreme anger and extreme pietydriving her poor daughter crazy in the process. Nothing seems to be able to get her out of this funk until one day about half way through the film when she meets a vivacious younger man Burt Lancaster who oddly seems taken with her! Why? I have no idea as Magnani's character is a pig in many waysdisheveled and with the personality of a boar! And speaking of a character who is annoying what's with Burt Lancaster? As I said above his character is drawn to Magnani and this makes little sensenor does his rushing out to get a tattoo to impress her just after he meets her. At first his character was interesting but after a while he too was anything but subtle. The combination of him and Magnani is simply too much for one movie!I have seen about every Tennessee Williams film and would have to say this is one of the weakest. The plot isn't bad but the characters are just too shrill and tough to believe. The story should have been a lot better. And frankly I wonder how Sicilians felt watching this as the Magnani's character seems to portray these Italians in a less than flattering light.".

	schema:reviewBody "James Mitchner once stated that the south is the same in every country. He said this in reference to the sharp differences of the people north and south in his beloved Spain likening Andalusian Spanards to Southern Americans. But it seems to hold just as true if not more so in Itally. Neopalitans and Sicilians are a completely different people from those of the more Northern reaches of the Itallian peninsula. So when Sicilians started migrating to the United States in the 1880's it is not surprising they gravitated to the area of New Orleans then the southernmost U. S. metropolis Houston was still a swampy village at the time. And it is not surprising they found a comfortable home there. Itallians as a race especially the southern variety have a flair for the melodramatic which they cultivate glory in and use as a formidable manipulative weapon especially against their own family members. It is not for nothing that most of the best operas come from Itally. Well we in the South are used to such because were are used to Southern Belles hillbilly grand mamas Southern Baptist preachers old style Southern gentlemen AfroAmerican Church sisters and just about any of our senators all of whom can almost keep up with the best of Sicilians in the melodramatic department. I said almost.In the Rose Tattoo set in an Itallian neighborhood close to New Orleans the great Italian actress Anna Magnani turns in her tour de force performance of high histrionics in this delightful farce from the usually grim Tennesse Williams. She is considerably aided by a gaggle of unknown actresses who play her frumpy nosy neighbors and a winning offcharacter performance by Burt Lancaster as her clownish suitor. The earthy Ms. Magnani was unarguably deserving of the Best Actress Accademy Award she received for this role. Burt Lancaster showed what a fine actor he was that he as an established dashing leading man at the peak of his career was willing to take on such an unglamorous role. Don't listen to the mavens who say he overacted. The role called for it and he did it brilliantly. He even consented to having his leonine locks sheared into a very badly done crew cut to cultivate his character's buffoonish appearance and perhaps also to make him look closer to the 47year old Magnani in age.It may be hard to believe how Americans of the 'fifties could see a sex symbol in a plump middleaged Itallian dame with bags like badly laundered shirt pockets beneath her eyes. But Anna Magnani was such at the time and though not for every taste she may still have a following in that department. She looked very good to me once she got cleaned up but then I'm at a point in life where everyone under fifty looks young to me. She was actually only 5 years older than Lancaster and there seems to be real chemistry between them in this movie. In any case they were good team for comedy which is what the Rose Tattoo was in spite of the failure of some humorless types to grasp it. It was a hoot all the way through  at least for those who understand the futility of pretensions and the humor of the human condition. Even Anna's years of grieving depression over her supposedly wonderful deceased husband was so ridiculously melodramatic as to be played for laughs.The acting was firstrate from the top to the bottom of the cast. The lush sets  and the black  white Vista Vision cinematography both of which won Accademy Awards were marvelous. The Rose Tattoo is one of the great comedies or the 1950's era.".

	onyx:emotionText "James Mitchner once stated that the south is the same in every country. He said this in reference to the sharp differences of the people north and south in his beloved Spain likening Andalusian Spanards to Southern Americans. But it seems to hold just as true if not more so in Itally. Neopalitans and Sicilians are a completely different people from those of the more Northern reaches of the Itallian peninsula. So when Sicilians started migrating to the United States in the 1880's it is not surprising they gravitated to the area of New Orleans then the southernmost U. S. metropolis Houston was still a swampy village at the time. And it is not surprising they found a comfortable home there. Itallians as a race especially the southern variety have a flair for the melodramatic which they cultivate glory in and use as a formidable manipulative weapon especially against their own family members. It is not for nothing that most of the best operas come from Itally. Well we in the South are used to such because were are used to Southern Belles hillbilly grand mamas Southern Baptist preachers old style Southern gentlemen AfroAmerican Church sisters and just about any of our senators all of whom can almost keep up with the best of Sicilians in the melodramatic department. I said almost.In the Rose Tattoo set in an Itallian neighborhood close to New Orleans the great Italian actress Anna Magnani turns in her tour de force performance of high histrionics in this delightful farce from the usually grim Tennesse Williams. She is considerably aided by a gaggle of unknown actresses who play her frumpy nosy neighbors and a winning offcharacter performance by Burt Lancaster as her clownish suitor. The earthy Ms. Magnani was unarguably deserving of the Best Actress Accademy Award she received for this role. Burt Lancaster showed what a fine actor he was that he as an established dashing leading man at the peak of his career was willing to take on such an unglamorous role. Don't listen to the mavens who say he overacted. The role called for it and he did it brilliantly.

	schema:reviewBody "Think of a character equal parts Meryl Streep and Irene Pappas only Sicilian and rather mad with grief and you end up with Anna Magnani playing the wonderfully unhinged Serafina Delle Rosa in The Rose Tattoo.How crazy is Serafina? So much so you can't take her as a dramatic character because her most dramatic scenes play like comedy yet you can't laugh too much because you feel such sympathy for her. Tennessee Williams' play becomes a rather endearing character piece with Magnani and director Daniel Mann working odd angles for maximum audience reaction.Magnani plays Serafina as if she was a character not in a movie but in a song namely Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus. For her every opportunity to fondle her husband's torso is a chance to reach out touch faith. She believes so absolutely in his majesty that it's a bit of a blow to put it lightly when she discovers he's actually a louse. Can she break out of her spell and find new love even if it's a clown wrapped in the body of Burt Lancaster?Lancaster's performance here is both the film's weakest link and testament to the actor's willingness to serve a role at whatever cost. His character Alvaro thinks Magnani the perfect find however dark the bags under her eyes and big her caboose. Whenever he laughs you groan a bit because it's not convincing yet you root for him all the same both because it's Lancaster in a difficult role and because he represents Serafina's one shot at happiness.Magnani won the Oscar for best actress for her performance here. It's deserved for the way she works past any expectations of Hollywood beauty to present us with a character who wins us over despite the fact she's rather ridiculous. Others talk about her straight dramatic moments as witness of her artistry but her two best moments for me are both comic.In one she corners a priest to make him confess to her what her husband confessed as part of a Holy Sacrament something that would play heavy except for the way Magnani cleverly overplays her scene not so much as you notice because of how emotional her character is except when you see it a second time and see more clearly her absurd husbandworship overtaking her.In the other she corrals the boyfriend of her daughter delectable Marisa Pavin and makes him promise as a fellow Catholic to respect her daughter's virginity while the daughter watches with obvious anger at her mother's power play. Yet when the boy agrees the domineering Serafina becomes pleasantly affectionate winning us over and reminding us of the price she paid for another man's lack of sexual restraint.For most of the movie Serafina is at her wits' end and Magnini draws a fine line between protagonist and monster again in a way that shreds the Hollywood image of the period. It's a rather overdrawn film with lots of goofy scenes and Lancaster struggling to keep up his end of the proceedings but when you give The Rose Tattoo a chance you wind up enjoying it more than you may expect. Tennessee Williams wrote soapy stories but he knew how to make them work too.".

Few actresses had ever made such a fiery arrival on American screens and her performance won her an Oscar as Best Actress. Subsequent screen appearances clearly showed that her acting range did not extend far beyond what she showed here leading her to be somewhat typecast as a hyperemotional Italian but even if her legacy had only been this film it would be memorable. Burt Lancaster is rather oddly cast as a slightly simple truck driver who has a crush on Magnani's character. Burt's physicality works here but his obviously greater depth and awareness at times run counter to the liveinthe moment needs of his not very bright character and the resulting performance is never completely convincing. Marisa Pavan the twin sister of better known Italian star Pier Angeli got a nomination as best supporting actress as the fragile daughter struggling to hold her own grief in check while searching for her place in a recognizably Tennessee Williams world of sultry Southern backwardness and soap opera passions. Excellent black and white cinematography by James Wong Howe won the film another Oscar and evocative production design created a believable Southern town square around which this otherwise rather stagy adaptation plays out. Like all Tennessee Williams dramas this one can get somewhat overwrought at times but Magnani and Pavan make it watchable  if ultimately dismissible  entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Rose Tattoo 1955 was directed by Daniel Mann. It's based on a play by Tennessee Williams who also wrote the screenplay. It stars Anna Magnani as Serafina Delle Rose a Sicilian dressmaker now living in Louisiana. Actually filmed in Florida.One drawback to the film is the miscasting of Burt Lancaster as Alvaro Mangiacavallo a man who falls in love with Magnani. Lancaster was a good actor but he's not good enough to convince us he's Sicilian. The second drawback is that the movie has adapted from a play written all over it. Director Mann shows us a police chase a beach scene and a trip to a church and to a gambling casino in an attempt to open up the play into a movie. It just doesn't work. It's unmistakably 1950's Broadway melodrama.However there was more that was positive than was negative about this movie. Marisa Pavan as Serafina's daughterRosa Delle Rosedoes a good job. It's an important supporting role and Pavan excelled in it. She also looked as if she could be Magnani's daughter. The important point is that Magnani is wonderful and the movie works because of her. Magnani was traditionally beautiful as a young actor and at age 47 she was still beautiful. However she was no longer traditionally beautiful. Instead she has a presence or aura that makes you want to look at her every moment that she's on the screen. She is a force of nature. Director Mann knew this about Magnani and the great cinematographer James Wong Howe knew how to present this force to us. I don't usually mention cinematographers in my IMDb reviews but James Wong Howe won an Oscar for his cinematography in this film.If you want to see a talented actor at the full height of her powers see Anna Magnani in The Rose Tattoo! That's not just my opinionMagnani won an Oscar for her work in this movie.We saw this film on DVD and it did well on the small screen. It's a great movie and a piece of cinema history. Find it and see it.".

Perhaps it only really shares it's loose relation to historical facts. But where Forman drives home Shaffer's story with absolute confidence and dramatic certainty Avati threads gently around the historic persona and in reality makes a film about childhood in general rather than Mozart in particular. The focus of the story is that last summer those last few weeks of childhood. Avati tells his story as Mozart is fourteen years old spending time at Count Pallavicini's summer estate outside Bologna before an important exam at the Philharmonic Academy. Mozart Cristopher Davidson is more taken by the subtle mysteries of the estate the wonder of the surrounding woods and a friendship with the count's son Guiseppe Dario Parisini. Perhaps it is not so much the woods in themselves as what they represent as they stand between the estate where Mozart studies and the house of the beautiful Antonia Barbara Rebeschini the young girl destined to marry Guiseppe. The young trio the three of us of the title form a loving friendship experiencing the awakening of adolescence together. Emotive as the subject matter is there are no big gestures in the film the trio explores each other and their surroundings and find new emotions of love and camaraderie on the threshold of forming their own persona's in a place and time where the grown up world is both near and far at the same time. Avati's story and direction threats the subject with tenderness and elegance employing lush 18th century milieu's atmospheric ochre color schemed cinematography and lovingly pastiche Mozart music by Ritz Ortolani. In all this Avanti strays from overstating events giving the story an equal sense of honest realism and lingering mystery. This is not a film about an exceptional singular genius but a film about a young boy.".

Hardly anything happens and what does happen is neither exciting nor very engaging. As one would expect the music is choices are reasonable throughout and the costumes are fairly good.

Gene Wilders appearances in The Producers Blazing Saddles Young Frankenstein and not to forget although not from Mel Brooks Silver Streak are rightfully and indisputably regarded as masterpieces by now. Compared to these highlights I actually found The Woman in Red slightly dull.Watching it on CableTV yesterday i.e. January 2006 I got a completely different impression. I don't know if the difference is just me being 20 years older and more tunedin with the main character but now I experienced a warm enjoyable movie filled with a mild madness I found most appealing. The spirit of the early 80's is very evident this is not a timeless movie. Nevertheless I find it more uptodate with human emotions and behavior than most contemporary attempts in the daily life comedy genre.Finally if you  just like me  was disappointed by this one twenty years ago give another try!".

I am a big fan of Gene Wilder he seems to have a natural ability to make me laugh so i knew i was in for a good laugh here.  I must have seen The Woman in Red about 12 times now over the years and it just keeps getting better.  What a shame Gene Wilder doesn't make movies any more i feel there is no good talent around for comedy these days. It seems to be just young guys who are good looking so people would like them whatever they do.  Gene Wilder on the other hand is a comedy legend not just an actor but a director and writer he is a man of many talents and i really miss him.  Also worth noting about The Woman in Red is the soundtrack by Stevie Wonder it's so 80's and it just brings me back to those days again.  Gene Wilder plays a man seeking adventure in his life and becomes obsessed with the woman in red played by Kelly LeBrock.  That's your basic storyline simple and straight to the point so the laughs begin immediately as Teddy Wilder pursues Charlotte LeBrock and gets into all kinds of trouble as he chases after the woman in red.  Hilarious.".

He not only stars but also wrote and directed the picture. As a writer and director he does a soso job. This movie has alot of silly moments that are totally preposterous. And it contains a few laughable lines of dialogue. But The Woman in Red for the most part is a pretty funny film. Wilder is good as Teddy Pierce a married man who one day see's a beautiful woman wearing a red dress. After catching a glimpse of this woman he becomes obsessed with her and can't get her out of his mind. Wilder gets some good support from an exceptional cast which includes Charles Grodin Joseph Bolonga Judith Ivey Kelly LeBrock as The Woman in Red and of course Wilder's late wife Gilda Radner. The Woman in Red ain't a great comedy but a good one. Only if Wilder had done a better directing job this would have been a great farce. out of four".

His performance is as usual superb and he is surrounded by well chosen actors who also provide laughs. The ending leans a bit too close to whimsical but it hardly deters the viewer's enjoyment.

And it turns out she is a model for the San Francisco cable car ad campaign which Teddy is involved with. Despite that Teddy has a lot of trouble meeting this woman and his attempts meet with humorous results. For example on more than one occasion he thinks he is talking to her but it turns out to be Ms. Milner and this is good for a number a laughs.Teddy however shouldn't be thinking about another woman. He is married to Didi and they have two daughters. If Teddy needed any incentive to behave himself he should keep in mind what happened to Joey when he cheated on Teresa Joey and Teresa's young son is staying with Teddy and Didi. And apparently he is not destined to have a relationship with Charlotte because his attempts are just one disaster after another.Gene Wilder is good as always especially with physical comedy and when he has to talk his way out of jams. Kelly LeBrock is pleasant and sweet with a slightly naughty side I saw an edited version so I surely didn't see all there was of her. Gilda Radner is nasty in a way that didn't appeal to me but others might like it. I liked most of the songs by Dionne Warwick and Stevie Wonder some of which they did togetherthough one gets played entirely too much on the radio all these years later and I got tired of it long ago. There is some physical comedy but plenty of funny situations too. But the movie is not all funny. Some of it is touching and some parts are depressing.Some highlights in addition to Joey's nasty surprise and Ms. Milner's bizarre behaviorWe hear one side of what may be a very naughty phone conversation at Teddy's workplace.A hilarious scene in a nice restaurant where one of Teddy's friends pretends to be blind and causes chaos.Shelly whose hairstyle sort of looks Native American while black on the sides it's red and blonde in the middle even though his parents are Jewish has come to take Teddy's daughter Missy to a David Bowie concert.Didi explains what happened to Joey and Teresa but doesn't say everything.Teddy and Didi are getting ready for a big night but that gets interrupted.Teddy's grandmother Mama Dell is celebrating her 85th birthday. I can't say more but from the time Teddy arrives at her apartment until the end of the movie everything is great and most of it is very funny.

	schema:reviewBody "Hard to believe but this movie is over 20 years old!! While not a great movie its rating on IMDb seems to be a bit low. I think it deserves a 6 or a 7.Gene Wilder was 50 here when he played Teddy Pierce an otherwise normal married man who catches a glimpse of temptation in the beautiful form of Charlotte played by Kelly LeBrock 23. A perfect older manyounger woman attraction not unlike 10 with Dudley Moore. In real life an attraction such as this almost always ends a split second after it begins. Teddy was a typical frumpy middle aged man and Charlotte a slim beautiful young woman. But the funny begins when Charlotte actually reciprocates the attraction.They end up in her place in the daytime Teddy has undressed and is under the sheets waiting for Charlotte when  surprise surprise  Charlotte's young and virile husband comes home unexpectedly. So Teddy exercises his only viable option go out the window onto the ledge almost nude. The audience below thinks he wants to jump and that attracts a big congregation of police and news media. His family see him on TV and the rest plays out in a very funny manner.Charles Grodin is very good as Buddy the homosexual friend of Teddy's and has to save the moment at a surprise party where Teddy is with Charlotte. In all an entertaining movie nothing more. Kelly LeBrock started out as a model and we can see why. However she wasn't much of an actress and that shows in her later work. Nothing much to write about.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hard to believe but this movie is over 20 years old!! While not a great movie its rating on IMDb seems to be a bit low. I think it deserves a 6 or a 7.Gene Wilder was 50 here when he played Teddy Pierce an otherwise normal married man who catches a glimpse of temptation in the beautiful form of Charlotte played by Kelly LeBrock 23. A perfect older manyounger woman attraction not unlike 10 with Dudley Moore. In real life an attraction such as this almost always ends a split second after it begins. Teddy was a typical frumpy middle aged man and Charlotte a slim beautiful young woman. But the funny begins when Charlotte actually reciprocates the attraction.They end up in her place in the daytime Teddy has undressed and is under the sheets waiting for Charlotte when  surprise surprise  Charlotte's young and virile husband comes home unexpectedly. So Teddy exercises his only viable option go out the window onto the ledge almost nude. The audience below thinks he wants to jump and that attracts a big congregation of police and news media. His family see him on TV and the rest plays out in a very funny manner.Charles Grodin is very good as Buddy the homosexual friend of Teddy's and has to save the moment at a surprise party where Teddy is with Charlotte. In all an entertaining movie nothing more. Kelly LeBrock started out as a model and we can see why. However she wasn't much of an actress and that shows in her later work. Nothing much to write about.";

But I didn't turn off the movie and I was glad I didn't...with a few reservations. First the reservations. Today we call Gene Wilder's actions in this film stalking. We call some of the comments and actions by other male characters in the film sexual harassment. And Gilda Radner all but disappears halfway through the film. But worst of all this film has to have one of the lousiest endings in cinema history. Does his marriage live or die? Very unsatisfactory.However the movie also has its redeeming facets. A dignified gay character at a time when that was rare in American cinema. Some sentimental snippets about what friendship really is along with some about what friendship isn't.The actors here are interesting if not good. Gene Wilder was Gene Wilder nothing new there pleasant on screen. Kelly LeBrock as the super model well a rather short film career with little real depth. Gilda Radner was fun. Charles Grodin whom I never saw as a real actor comes off nicely here as the gay character that manages to hang onto straight friendships Grodin was always a pleasant man to see on screen. Joseph Bologna...well difficult to like the role but he played it well. Judith Ivey as Wilder's wife...perhaps the best acting in the film.Dated very imperfect disappointing...but still worth a watch...one more time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's be honest. This isn't a movie to take all that seriously and it has to be evaluated on that basis. It's a bit of a thin storyline revolving around quiet ad executive Teddy's attempt to  well  get it on with the beautiful model Charlotte in spite of the fact that he's happily married and that Charlotte seems at least at first glance somewhat out of his league. Gene Wilder and Kelly Le Brock are the two main characters in this. Wilder was very good and there were a lot of amusing scenes for him scattered throughout and some fun moments of misunderstanding with his office colleague Ms Milner played by Wilder's reallife wife Gilda Radner. Even knowing that it's coming I can't help but laugh as Milner keys his car because she thinks he stood her up or sends him careening helplessly down one of San Francisco's hills or as he walks down the hall in his fancy new clothes and high fives a colleague with the words What it is! Wilder caught the character of Teddy  strangely drawn to Charlotte and yet knowing that he's a happy guy already with his wife Didi Judith Ivey and their daughters and even as he pursues Charlotte you can almost see the wheels turning in his head as he asks himself why? Le Brock although playing the title character was less central to the movie which really revolved more around Teddy and his guy friends played by Joseph Bologna Charles Grodin and Michael Huddleston. She was fine and certainly didn't detract from the movie at all although I didn't think her performance was especially powerful either.The movie is a wonderful length  at 126 just perfect for a fun little comedy of no great importance. Not to be overlooked are some wonderful songs performed by Stevie Wonder and Dionne Warwick. The only part of the movie I really didn't care for had to do with the character of Shelly Michael Zorek  the punk boyfriend of one of Teddy's daughters. The character wasn't likable first of all especially as he groped at Didi and the character also served absolutely no purpose to the overall story. Aside from that it is indeed a fun movie. 710".

With the help of some friends Teddy works around the suspicions of his wife Judith Ivey and the anger of a spurned coworker Gilda Radner to arrange a furtive rendezvous with the object of his desire.Best remembered today for the film debut of the bodacious LeBrock and a soundtrack that featured Stevie Wonder's hit song I Just Called To Say I Love You this is a movie that aims low and still misses. Wilder who wrote and directed presents a comedy that is not only not funny but so tonally off as to become uncomfortable to watch.Take the scenes with Radner. One of the great comedic talents of her time Radner's wasted here as the butt of humor as mean as it is nonsensical. We see her as a lovestarved crone being duped by bad luck into thinking Teddy wants to get romantic with her only to find he doesn't. This drives her to inflict vengeance on him and his helpless car. Why does Teddy put up with this rather than take it up with her or with HR?You might answer that it's because this is a farce but elsewhere The Woman In Red is played much more dramatically too much so. Two of Teddy's male friends undergo crises involving romantic partners that are played very seriously and developed in a heavy handed way by Wilder that threatens his largely jokeless comedy. Or was I supposed to be laughing when Joseph Bologna has a nervous breakdown after discovering his wife and kids left him?Wilder is only a little more successful working on Teddy's home life as when Teddy discovers his wife keeps a revolver around the house and admits to being easily jealous.You realize you might have shot me? he tells her after her gun accidentally goes off.I would never do that she answers. Not without a reason.There are also little side bits that never make any sense like a daughter's boyfriend who sports an aggressive Mohawk hairdo and makes clumsy passes at Teddy's wife or a destructive and pointless gag Teddy's friends play at a fancy restaurant. These don't connect to the main story and they aren't funny on their own.At one point we discover Teddy's wife hosts a diet clinic in their home for reasons that are never explained. The entire purpose of this seems to be to provide Wilder with an excuse for some physical humor walking through a thick crowd of people in his character's living room while an instructor drones on about something called the Alphabet diet You have to watch yourself carefully because by the time you get to 'P' you might put on all the weight you lost on 'K' she tells them.And what of LeBrock's character Charlotte? As male fantasy object she certainly works for me. Yet except for one scene in an elevator with Charles Grodin playing one of Teddy's friends she never breaks out of that to develop any comic identity or dramatic interest.Wilder's performance alternates between goofy and wan he was in an odd period in his career after some fantastic comedic performances over the prior 15 years apparently left him with no more mountains to climb. He seems tired and disengaged here adding to the weight of a very labored film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adapted from the French film 'un elephant ca trompe enormement' or better known as 'Pardon Mon affaire' not seen the French film so can't compare the two this American attempt shows businessman Theodore 'Teddy' Pierce Gene Wilder standing on a window ledge at the top of a tall building and from there we get shown how he got on that ledge in the first place.Teddy Pierce encountered a model named Charlotte Kelly Le Brock in a carpark and noticed her getting her dress bellowing upwards as she stands over a grate 'Seven Year Itch' style. He is attracted to her instantly and he starts to pursue her almost to the detriment of his marriage to loving wife Didi Judith Ivey. He tries to start up a date with Charlotte by calling her from his desk but via miscommunication his less beautiful coworker Ms Milner Wilder's reallife late wife Gilda Radner takes the call instead. As this is going on his friends Buddy Charles Grodin Joey Joseph Bologna and Mikey Mike Huddleston also embark on affairs.Now I love this film because I like watching Gene Wilder act. I love the 80s backdrop the soundtracks by Stevie Wonder and the light treatment of a serious topic but 'Woman in Red' is not rescued from my biasness. It is a flawed movie.There are some problems with the directing also done by Wilder with too many incidental moments that don't click and seem tacked on to get the film to it's hour and twenty odd minute target one example is the gratuitous 'blindman gag' scene but the biggest problem this film has is the quality of the dialogue in it. It can be truly awful if not confusing at times. Consider Joey he is supposed to be the smart talking quickwitted guy but the verbal exchange below is all they could come up with for him. This is taken from an early scene where the buddies all play tennis together. Joey makes a smash breaks his racket over the net but the ball goes over regardlessMikey You hit the net. Joey On the follow through. Mikey You can't hit the net. Joey On the follow through. Mikey No you still can't hit the net! Joey On the follow through Mikey. I hit the ball first then the net on the follow through. It's our point the score is 62 you're in the sthouse and did anyone tell you you're cute?Mikey sarcastically and walking off indignantly You're cute too.My guess is that Wilder was trying for the Neil Simon approach to fastpaced dialogue seen in 'The Odd Couple'. The difference obviously is that Simon would have put something funny in there. The fact that Joey calls someone towards the end of the film 'half a hard on' only emphasises my point.Here we have Didi looking after 'Joe's little boy' for apparently no reason at all apart from being an excuse for this piece of dialogue.Teddy What a cute little pee pee.Didi You leave his little pee pee alone. It's his daddy's little pee pee that started it all.confused look from TeddyA confused look from me too. What Teddy Pierce is doing complimenting a child's genitalia is anyone's guess lol.The PierceShelly showdown where Shelly Michael Zorek repeats everything Wilder says was more moronic than menacing which is a shame because Zorek did look convincing in his role. Gilda Radner did a better job of being menacing with her chilling stares.This is definitely a vanity piece for Wilder. He was the star of this film and everybody else revolved around him and almost became insignificant apart from to seemingly flatter his ego. Charles Grodin as sensitive Buddy is the standout for me who did a lot with the paper thin character he was given. Oh the ending is just as baffling. If I had a wife who saw me on the news in someone else's dressing gown on a window ledge smoking a cigarette she wouldn't have tears of laughter in her eyes I can tell you...As for Kelly Le Brock? Well...diplomatically speaking...she tried lol.All this from a film I do like haha.".

It is a flawed movie.There are some problems with the directing also done by Wilder with too many incidental moments that don't click and seem tacked on to get the film to it's hour and twenty odd minute target one example is the gratuitous 'blindman gag' scene but the biggest problem this film has is the quality of the dialogue in it. It can be truly awful if not confusing at times. Consider Joey he is supposed to be the smart talking quickwitted guy but the verbal exchange below is all they could come up with for him. This is taken from an early scene where the buddies all play tennis together. Joey makes a smash breaks his racket over the net but the ball goes over regardlessMikey You hit the net. Joey On the follow through. Mikey You can't hit the net. Joey On the follow through. Mikey No you still can't hit the net! Joey On the follow through Mikey. I hit the ball first then the net on the follow through. It's our point the score is 62 you're in the sthouse and did anyone tell you you're cute?Mikey sarcastically and walking off indignantly You're cute too.My guess is that Wilder was trying for the Neil Simon approach to fastpaced dialogue seen in 'The Odd Couple'. The difference obviously is that Simon would have put something funny in there. The fact that Joey calls someone towards the end of the film 'half a hard on' only emphasises my point.Here we have Didi looking after 'Joe's little boy' for apparently no reason at all apart from being an excuse for this piece of dialogue.Teddy What a cute little pee pee.Didi You leave his little pee pee alone. It's his daddy's little pee pee that started it all.confused look from TeddyA confused look from me too. What Teddy Pierce is doing complimenting a child's genitalia is anyone's guess lol.The PierceShelly showdown where Shelly Michael Zorek repeats everything Wilder says was more moronic than menacing which is a shame because Zorek did look convincing in his role. Gilda Radner did a better job of being menacing with her chilling stares.This is definitely a vanity piece for Wilder. He was the star of this film and everybody else revolved around him and almost became insignificant apart from to seemingly flatter his ego. Charles Grodin as sensitive Buddy is the standout for me who did a lot with the paper thin character he was given. Oh the ending is just as baffling. If I had a wife who saw me on the news in someone else's dressing gown on a window ledge smoking a cigarette she wouldn't have tears of laughter in her eyes I can tell you...As for Kelly Le Brock? Well...diplomatically speaking...she tried lol.All this from a film I do like haha.";

He basically spends 90 minutes humiliating himself leading on a needy secretary Gilda Radner totally wasted and making excuses to his devoted wife Judith Ivey. Radner tries to be funny with her Fatal Attraction like revenge but the material betrays her. Some good shots of mid 80's San Francisco and a series of pleasant songs by Stevie Wonder and Dionne Warwick including the Academy Award Winning I Just Called to Say I Love You help make this a slight bit more tolerable but the humor is juvenile the setup beyond believable and the script by Wilder dull. A scene with one of Wilder's workers pretending to be blind in a restaurant and destroying it is a pale imitation of the similar scene in the W.C. Fields classic It's a Gift and totally out of place.As for LeBrock she is certainly eye catching in the garage scene wearing the titular red dress but is a beautiful block of ice otherwise. Wilder is a talented comic but he seems to be holding back strange considering he was directing himself speaking his own dialog! and is definitely missing the partnership that shown on screen for him with Mel Brooks and Richard Pryor in previous ventures. Radner one of the funniest women since Lucy deserved much better in the few films she made and her presence is a total missed opportunity. Ivey would fare better on stage and in later character roles where she was truly able to let herself go. Joseph Bologna and Charles Grodin are even more wasted as Wilder's cronies.

	schema:headline " A flawed though no less interesting experiment in ultrachic visual filmmaking.";
	schema:reviewBody "At the time a huge boxoffice hit in its native France  and as a result of the rising popularity of lead actors Christopher Lambert and Isabelle Adjani something of a cult film in the UK  Subway 1985 was seen as a companion piece to Jean Jacques Beineix's earlier arthouse classic Diva 1981. Together these two films can be seen as both the development and the continuation of the concerns and preoccupations of the thennewly dubbed cinema du look movement a brief cinematic resurgence in French cinema that saw a younger generation of filmmakers looking back to the days of Godard Truffaut and the Nouvelle Vague and combining that sense of playful experimentation with elements of early 80's pop culture. It would be the film that finally introduced director Luc Besson to a wider commercial audience outside of the confines of the French arthouse and really  when looked at as part of the natural progression of his career  seems light years away from his first film the wordless science fiction parable Le Dernier CombatThe Last Battle 1983.The characteristics of the cinema du look movement involved preoccupations with doomed love and alienated Parisian youth applied to a plot that was both cool and iconic. This can be seen quite clearly in Subway with its mixture of film noir conventions pop music subterranean youthculture action and broad attempts at humour. As others have previously noted the film and the style that it employs are very much of their time presenting a very 80's take on listless youth replete with a central character that looks like Sting a synthesiser heavy soundtrack that manages to workin two specially composted New Wave pop songs some shocking fashion choices though most of these are admittedly back in vogue and that general unique indescribable feeling that you often get from many French films from this era in particular Buffet Froid 1981 One Deadly Summer 1983 The Moon in the Gutter 1983 First Name Carmen 1983 Hail Mary 1985 Betty Blue 1986 Mauvais Sang 1986 Jean de FloretteManon des Sources 1986 and Besson's own subsequent picture Le Grand Bleu 1988. Subway doesn't necessarily have much in common with these particular films in terms of style or content but it does have a similar languid feeling bizarre eclecticism or eccentricity and an atmosphere that feels very much true to the country and the time it was produced.Overall the film could be seen by many viewers as something worryingly lightweight with the knockabout plot colourful caricatures and continual bombardment of cinematic style perhaps being seen as a smokescreen to the thin plot and ironic characterisations. Like Le Dernier Combat the ultimate problem with the film is that it can't quite decide whether or not it wants to be an action film or art film with the combination of the two very different styles never quite gelling in perfect harmony. The opening car chase and initial descent into the bowels of this subterranean underworld hidden deep beneath the Parisian Metro system seem to suggests that the film will be all highstyle and highenergy. Subsequent scenes however take a step back giving us some cool neonoir like interaction between Lambert's laconic safecracker and Adjani's bored trophy wife while the opposing forces of police and gangsters begin closing in around them. It is the kind of film that will definitely appeal to a certain kind of viewer perhaps a more mature audience who are open minded to cult European art cinema or perhaps maybe a dedicated audience interested in seeing how the director of such highly acclaimed action thrillers such Nikita 1991 or LeonThe Professional 1994 started out.After first seeing the film a few years ago I wrote This has no heart. It is an experiment in cinematic formalism obsessed with technicality but also consumed by the selfindulgence which to some extent still stands but I think with repeated viewings I've come to enjoy the film and see more of an allure and attraction to the characters of Fred and Hlna who quite clearly struggle throughout to maintain face and make the right decisions in a world that neither of them truly understands. As a result it might just be the kind of film that takes a few viewings to truly captivate the audience especially after drawing us in with that aforementioned car chase which nods to Claude Lelouch's iconic 1974 short film C'tait un rendezvous whilst simultaneously prefiguring much of the Bessonproduced film series Taxi. Subway clearly isn't a masterpiece. Like his first film Le Dernier Combat and the recent AngelA 2005 it shows Besson at his most inventive and experimental sampling from a variety of different genres and producing something that is chic and stylish without ever being truly captivating. It is however an interesting film and one that will no doubt appeal to fans of some of the films aforementioned chiefly Diva Buffet Froid and Mauvais Sang as well as some of Besson's own lesserknown works.".

	onyx:emotionText "At the time a huge boxoffice hit in its native France  and as a result of the rising popularity of lead actors Christopher Lambert and Isabelle Adjani something of a cult film in the UK  Subway 1985 was seen as a companion piece to Jean Jacques Beineix's earlier arthouse classic Diva 1981. Together these two films can be seen as both the development and the continuation of the concerns and preoccupations of the thennewly dubbed cinema du look movement a brief cinematic resurgence in French cinema that saw a younger generation of filmmakers looking back to the days of Godard Truffaut and the Nouvelle Vague and combining that sense of playful experimentation with elements of early 80's pop culture. It would be the film that finally introduced director Luc Besson to a wider commercial audience outside of the confines of the French arthouse and really  when looked at as part of the natural progression of his career  seems light years away from his first film the wordless science fiction parable Le Dernier CombatThe Last Battle 1983.The characteristics of the cinema du look movement involved preoccupations with doomed love and alienated Parisian youth applied to a plot that was both cool and iconic. This can be seen quite clearly in Subway with its mixture of film noir conventions pop music subterranean youthculture action and broad attempts at humour. As others have previously noted the film and the style that it employs are very much of their time presenting a very 80's take on listless youth replete with a central character that looks like Sting a synthesiser heavy soundtrack that manages to workin two specially composted New Wave pop songs some shocking fashion choices though most of these are admittedly back in vogue and that general unique indescribable feeling that you often get from many French films from this era in particular Buffet Froid 1981 One Deadly Summer 1983 The Moon in the Gutter 1983 First Name Carmen 1983 Hail Mary 1985 Betty Blue 1986 Mauvais Sang 1986 Jean de FloretteManon des Sources 1986 and Besson's own subsequent picture Le Grand Bleu 1988. Subway doesn't necessarily have much in common with these particular films in terms of style or content but it does have a similar languid feeling bizarre eclecticism or eccentricity and an atmosphere that feels very much true to the country and the time it was produced.Overall the film could be seen by many viewers as something worryingly lightweight with the knockabout plot colourful caricatures and continual bombardment of cinematic style perhaps being seen as a smokescreen to the thin plot and ironic characterisations. Like Le Dernier Combat the ultimate problem with the film is that it can't quite decide whether or not it wants to be an action film or art film with the combination of the two very different styles never quite gelling in perfect harmony. The opening car chase and initial descent into the bowels of this subterranean underworld hidden deep beneath the Parisian Metro system seem to suggests that the film will be all highstyle and highenergy. Subsequent scenes however take a step back giving us some cool neonoir like interaction between Lambert's laconic safecracker and Adjani's bored trophy wife while the opposing forces of police and gangsters begin closing in around them. It is the kind of film that will definitely appeal to a certain kind of viewer perhaps a more mature audience who are open minded to cult European art cinema or perhaps maybe a dedicated audience interested in seeing how the director of such highly acclaimed action thrillers such Nikita 1991 or LeonThe Professional 1994 started out.After first seeing the film a few years ago I wrote This has no heart. It is an experiment in cinematic formalism obsessed with technicality but also consumed by the selfindulgence which to some extent still stands but I think with repeated viewings I've come to enjoy the film and see more of an allure and attraction to the characters of Fred and Hlna who quite clearly struggle throughout to maintain face and make the right decisions in a world that neither of them truly understands. As a result it might just be the kind of film that takes a few viewings to truly captivate the audience especially after drawing us in with that aforementioned car chase which nods to Claude Lelouch's iconic 1974 short film C'tait un rendezvous whilst simultaneously prefiguring much of the Bessonproduced film series Taxi. Subway clearly isn't a masterpiece. Like his first film Le Dernier Combat and the recent AngelA 2005 it shows Besson at his most inventive and experimental sampling from a variety of different genres and producing something that is chic and stylish without ever being truly captivating. It is however an interesting film and one that will no doubt appeal to fans of some of the films aforementioned chiefly Diva Buffet Froid and Mauvais Sang as well as some of Besson's own lesserknown works.";

I actually didn't recognise Reno that's how young and unknown he is here.If you have a deeper interest in cinema this is a straight ten. It's amazing how Besson brings together great style action fun pace acting dialogue and amazing characters. Unlike most directors who film in the province and try to make it look like Paris Besson films in Paris but makes it look like Metropolis.Unfortunately there isn't much of a plot and zilch suspense. The film starts with a heated hearttoheart between Fred and pretty Hlna and since we are aware that their affair can't end but unhappily albeit in an incredibly chic way the suspense is exactly zero.

The bubblegum romanticcrimedrama premise is a washing machine filled with ideas which are hanging off a very loose but unpredictable plot. There's not much groundwork but its impulsive nature trivial gimmicks and interesting urban environment just gets you caught in the disjointed whirlwind of these strenuously adventurous situations melancholy despair and eccentric characters. The delirious script never takes itself seriously the humour is strong and feels insignificant but it sure had many awkward and lumpy exchanges. Some passages feel quite useless and have poor continuity but there's a certain charm that's hard to resist. The English dubbed version sounds quite terrible though. It's like Besson has thrown caution to the wind and is experimenting with his visually sharp prowess and stylish verve to get any sort of impact and details through. His placement pacing and overall enthusiasm is impeccable. Some action sequences mainly the opening car chase scene is very well delivered. He draws so much form very little and never seems bounded by logic. From the getgo he storms right in and never lets the smoking composition slick atmosphere sway off course. Brimming in is an electrifying tacky electronic  rock soundtrack by Eric Serra and Carlo Varini's camerawork beautifully illustrates Besson's characteristically moody framings. The worthwhile cast do an admirable job. Christopher Lambert's broodingly dry and grasping performance has an immensely hypnotic ambiance to it. An alluring Isabelle Adjani draws up an infectiously collected and classy performance. There's enjoyably fine kooky support from JeanHughes Anglade Richard Bohringer JeanPierre Barcri Michel Galabru and the always delightful Besson regular Jean Reno.Besson's Subway is resourcefully fun and colourful pulp if a rather jaded experience.".

When I see it today it is just terribly out dated. Christopher Lambert with a ridiculous blonde hair cut Adjani totally overdressed in 80's designer clothes and wearing the ugliest pimp earrings I have ever seen. You also see Roller Skates again and you wish you don't. The problem is that the film is only based on decoration it totally lacks to transport some of the eighies feeling. Just presenting dead style is not enough to fill over 100 minutes of run time. This is just a pile of decoration without any soul.".

I love 80s movies but this one just lies there like fresh roadkill. Let me put it into perspective.It's as if John Hughes and John Carpenter had a kid and that kid wrote and directed this movie.  I'm sure the creators were thinking Does Molly Ringwald speak fluent French?  No?  Well let's get Isabelle Adjiani and dress her up to look like Ringwald.  They even cast a guy whose name is JeanHugues Anglade to be The Roller.  JeanHugues  John Hughes.  Am I the only one who sees this?  I'm not exaggerating these things.  I was reminded of movies like The WarriorsEscape From New YorkSixteen Candles  Ferris Bueller's Day Off but I failed to see the humor in anything except seeing Jean Reno with hair and playing the drums.  He must have practiced for weeks with those drumsticks.At least HE learned to play the drums and picked up a paycheck at the end of this film.  I was only left with option of rewinding the tape and returning it or destroying it so no one else would have to endure what I just did.".

So when written off as empty and superficial it is hardly a fair criticism because Besson did so obviously not try to make a traditional movie when he did Subway. Writing it off as pure junk is like writing off instrumental music because there's no singing.Subway is in many ways an eighties postmodern fairytale where our young new wave hero Fred sets out to get the girl of his dreams Helena. What follows though is exactly that a dream made of dark underground labyrinths cold neon light and electrofunk sounds courtesy of Eric Serra who by the way stars in the movie as himself producing the music which is the soundtrack of the feature. The Paris metro underground is inhabited by its own community and the symbolism is stunningly clear and charming  we're dealing with the SUBculture of the SUBway this is the underground. And of course Fred wants to form a rock band too.The plot IS very simple  after all it's a fairytale  and this is not a weakness quite the contrary. Subway is not pretentious at all but delves instead into style humour and something which can best be described as sheer industrial aesthetics quite frankly this is the movie that will make you love all the cold neonlit underground corridors in the world. And then you don't even know if you get a happy end or not.All in all an absolute favourite of mine plus a rare chance to see a stunning performance by Christophe Lambert. Oh and great haircuts.".

	schema:reviewBody "Subway is full of action and will take you places you have never been. The lead character Fred is constantly on the run from the cops and is wanted by the woman of his dreams but not in the way he wishes. This film throws you into an unfamiliar world filled with quirky characters all of which are involved in some sort of shenanigans deep in the depth of a Paris subway station. Moments after Fred's buddy a thief notorious for riding on roller skates gets arrested on the subway Fred is chased through the long dark corridors zigzagging through the crowds to escape their hold. He then flees their sight by slipping into an elevator and maneuvering his way through the secret passages of the subway.Luc Besson directed Subway in 1985. The films main actors include Isabelle Adjani Helena and Christopher Lambert Fred. Subway is not rated. Filming was partially held in the Paris Metro and the Paris RER along with scenes filmed on sets. After spending his night at an upperclass party held for the lovely Helena Fred gets his hands on very important documents belonging to an entrepreneurgangster Helena's husband. He abandons the party and winds up on the run in the Paris Metro among exotic strangers.Fred discovers this convenient hiding spot among people who are similar to him. He can't help but fall in love with the woman out to get him Helena. All while becoming part of the underground world of the subway Fred and his friends are persistently being chased down by the police and their enemies. To add even more pizazz to the film Fred gathers a group of musicians to play incredible tunes that comprise the soundtrack of the film.The music in Subway really gives it a unique touch. It isn't the kind of music you hear in your typical action movies. It has it's own jazzy vibe to it. Also the fact that a piece of the film is centered on the music really draws you into it more. It is fun to see these characters who are lounging around underground all day make some ear pleasing music. It sets the tone as a eccentric actionfilled film.I recommend this film. I must include that children should steer clear of watching this film because of its vulgar language. I think many people will enjoy this film because Luc Besson has created something different from the norm. With this film you can get some laughs and be put on the edge of your seat at moments. Its interesting music makes it amusing to view and listen to.".

The film turned out very bright thanks to directing and music by Eric Serra. He wrote the excellent tracks in this picture. He also wrote music for the film GoldenEye James Bond. Lambert played the role of eccentric romance with the ultra cool hairdo like his girlfriend in the film Adjani. Besson took a picture of undying love in an unusual entourage.

Poitier has come to Paris for reasons of the race problems in the USA. Into their lives two American tourists come Joanne Woodward and Diahann Carroll. A couple of dual romances commence. Carroll and Poitier have a spirited debate over civil rights. The movement is getting into high gear in America and Carroll wants him to return and be part of it. No thanks says Poitier he just wants to do his jazz thing where his skin color isn't anyone's problem least of all his own. Interestingly Carroll was doing a kind of warm up for another part of a black woman in Paris on Broadway the following year in Richard Rodgers No Strings. In that play she falls for an expatriate writer played by Richard Kiley. An interracial romance one of the first shown on the Broadway stage still a lot of the same issues were in that show.Paris Blues is a different slice of Parisian life for an American film to explore. All four leads do just fine though the film probably doesn't rank in the top work of any of them.Lots of jazz music for the aficionado. And of course the presence of the incomparable Louis Armstrong. The highlight of the film is the jam session with those two ersatz musicians Newman and Poitier.The way Satchmo is received by the public only proves the truth of that line he sang in High Society about the way the French love American jazz.".

Sidney Poitier is always right on the mark sensitive and real a superb actor. Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman play the illfated couple and do quite well as has already been mentioned in several reviews. While the story itself is not original the cinematography is you will see the street markets walking along the Seine Montmartre Notre Dame etc. Compare this to the last big Hollywood film Moulin Rouge and I would prefer this film any day!.This film is to be appreciated for the era it depicts I have traveled to Europe and always find that each person's impression is different Americans who have never traveled unfortunately perpetuate the stereotype That is sheer ignorance however. I sincerely hope that all Europeans do not see Americans as portrayed by Meg Ryan an imbecilic blonde American or for example Le Divorce with Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts Please note that Hollywood does NOT represent educated Americans. This is in itself sad because in the 1960's when my mother traveled to Europe I think the world was more friendly now when even the U.S. is divided into red and blue states we are consigned to trash films like Le Divorce which Hollywood makes for the lowest common denominator instead of smaller art films which are a pleasant experience.It is a shame that Hollywood portrays Americans as uncultured imbeciles this is all about the bottom line profits. I can honestly say that a real person has not been portrayed by American film blockbusters since the 1970's.See this film for yourself. It is definitely worth it.".

The film offers a unique retrospect of attitudes in America and Paris of the early 60's especially in regard towards race romance and the musician's love of their music. Several scenes dealing with these complex issues were extremely well acted especially Sidney Poitier and Diahnn Carroll's discussions dealing with race. On the lighter side to me personally it was a special treat to see the seemingly eternal film superstar Paul Newman known to today's youth as the salad dressing and microwave popcorn dude in his youth. The youthful Newman's powerful portrayal of the hipster jazz musician was very entertaining. It was humorous yet compellingly believable. Particularly priceless was hearing Newman using the now timeless slang that has since permeated our culture and is still in as common usage today as it was in the early 60's period of its origin. Overall this movie was pure entertainment. The jazz soundtrack featuring a special appearance by jazz legend Louie Armstrong was enjoyable even to the nonjazz listeners such as myself. The ending was wonderful leaving the viewer to arrive at their own conclusions as to whether Newman and Poitier would follow love back to America or remain in the Paris music scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted this to be a great great movie but it just wasn't.The main premisea lifeanddeath struggle between differing species of true lovewas for me a bit maddening because on one hand it's a potentially great premise.  Difficult to pull off but something worth taking on.  And although the writingdirectionacting came incredibly close to pulling it off I don't think they did.  There were a few flashes of brilliance where both love interests had wonderful dialog that felt like you were watching people working through realworld conflicts of the head and heart.  But in the end I wasn't impressed with the ending and the resolution you saw there.Another thing that bugged me was that although the music was very good and Newman and Poitier and others I suppose pulled off the the syncing with aplomb it still felt very staged.The side story re Gypsy's addiction wasn't really satisfying.  I guess there was a thing where love can wear a million masks and Newman's love for Gypsy as a brother and fellow musician was supposed to enter into the reckoning somehow.  But it didn't work for me.Poitier said man about twice as many times as he should have.The music is quite good.  Interesting esthetic decisions such as opening a club scene inprogress with the female vocalist in the middle of the B section of Sophisticated Lady.  The depiction of Paris was almost revolutionary capturing her raw side the combination of urban sophistication and a distinctly warm and human disinterest in having every little thing in place very intelligent move that.  On the other hand it didn't make sense to have Newman take Woodward on un bateaumouche only the touristas do that and Newman was supposed to be a hip habitue type.I saw a comment to the effect that the PoitierCarroll dialog on race and the necessity of staying home to man the battlements spoiled the purity of the film.  I would say that it certainly raised an interesting issue worth broaching with the American public.  I think the filmmakers should have tried to get across the interesting colorblindness of Paris society in a more direct way the way you see it when you're walkingridinghobnobbing around Paris.  Having it be implied in the dialog wasn't quite enough.  I suspect this aspect might have been lost on some Americans and would therefore result in a corresponding loss of dramatic tension.  Bytheway don't think I'm a pollyanna about race in France I haven't forgotten wartime Jewry or Le Pen!  It is of course a complex issue.  But there is a wondrous type of spiritual colorblindness in France that is lacking in the U.S. it's palpable.Gosh I don't know whether to recommend this film to you or not.I guess in the end it's a tossup.  If you want to see what Paris really looks like you could do worse.  There is some great acting and some fascinating dialogs.  The music is very good.  But in the end you may find it to be somewhat of a quasiintellectual snack and you're hungry for something real.  And I'm sorry but I can't think of a suitable replacement off the top of my head!".

The depiction of Paris was almost revolutionary capturing her raw side the combination of urban sophistication and a distinctly warm and human disinterest in having every little thing in place very intelligent move that.  On the other hand it didn't make sense to have Newman take Woodward on un bateaumouche only the touristas do that and Newman was supposed to be a hip habitue type.I saw a comment to the effect that the PoitierCarroll dialog on race and the necessity of staying home to man the battlements spoiled the purity of the film.  I would say that it certainly raised an interesting issue worth broaching with the American public.  I think the filmmakers should have tried to get across the interesting colorblindness of Paris society in a more direct way the way you see it when you're walkingridinghobnobbing around Paris.  Having it be implied in the dialog wasn't quite enough.  I suspect this aspect might have been lost on some Americans and would therefore result in a corresponding loss of dramatic tension.  Bytheway don't think I'm a pollyanna about race in France I haven't forgotten wartime Jewry or Le Pen!  It is of course a complex issue.  But there is a wondrous type of spiritual colorblindness in France that is lacking in the U.S. it's palpable.Gosh I don't know whether to recommend this film to you or not.I guess in the end it's a tossup.  If you want to see what Paris really looks like you could do worse.  There is some great acting and some fascinating dialogs.  The music is very good.  But in the end you may find it to be somewhat of a quasiintellectual snack and you're hungry for something real.  And I'm sorry but I can't think of a suitable replacement off the top of my head!";

The performances are universally superb. The script is free of the usual clichs. And the music is great. How could you possibly make a bad movie with the likes of Louis Armstrong Paul Newman Joanne Woodward Sidney Poitier and Diane Carrol? Nor in that era 1961 did Hollywood zoom in and linger obsessively on sexual acrobatics. This is a mature sexy film without any graphic sex.

	schema:headline " American jazz musicians in Paris in the fifties contains spectacular scene";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is worth seeing by anybody with any interest at all in music for the spectacular scene where Louis Armstrong has a 'music duel' with fellow musicians in a Paris jazz club. The film is excellently directed by Martin Ritt. It is based on a novel by Harold Flender 19241975 a television writer and this was his only novel to be made into a feature film. Flender was the grandfather of youthful actor Timothee Chalamet who played the 15 yearold Tom in INTERSTELLAR 2014. This film has the irresistible combination of Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward his wife. They had already made two films together THE LONG HOT SUMMER 1958 also directed by Ritt and FROM THE TERRACE 1960. Woodward had also been directed previously by Ritt in NO DOWN PAYMENT 1957 a film which is not commercially available on DVD today. Much of this film was shot on location in Paris and therefore has a great deal of authenticity though only one French character features in the story a singer played by Barbara Laage who delivers an excellent performance in her supporting role. The story concerns two American expatriate jazz musicians played by Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier. There is a strong performance also by Serge Reggiani as 'Gypsy' the jazz guitarist who is hopelessly addicted to cocaine. One day Joanne Woodward and Diahann Carroll turn up as tourists from America and they become involved with Newman and Poitier. Newman plays a coarse and unsympathetic character so that it is difficult to be too concerned about the problems of his love life. Both Newman and Poitier however fall in love with the two girls whose demands that they return to America and become homebodies and husbands shakes the two men. Will they 'go home' and find true love or will they stay in Paris? Louis Armstrong appears in one acting scene in the film and then the spectacular musical scene already mentioned. This is a first rate film which deserves to be better known today. Duke Ellington wrote the original music for the film. There was once a time when no one would miss a Newman and Woodward film as they were such a star couple but now few remember them just as fewer and fewer people remain who know what the magic words 'Burton and Taylor' used to mean in terms of box office appeal. Time moves on and people fade even the ones who seemed at the time to have lasting fame.".

Poitier and Newman are American jazz musicians in the French city while Carroll and Woodard are U.S. tourists who fall for the leading men. The most interesting scenes to me were those between Poitier and Carroll about discussions of living in America to experience the emerging civil rights cause which Diahann's character Connie wants vs. staying in France where people are colorblind which Sidney's character Eddie prefers. The other romance between Newman and Woodard is the kind you've seen in other movies though they make the scenes work nonetheless. And how cool was it to see Louis Armstrong as Wild Man Moore play his trumpet with the Poitier and Newman characters trying to keep up on the saxophone and trombone respectively. Also cool was the Duke Ellington score with possibly some of it done by his longtime associate Billy Strayhorn that got him his sole Oscar nomination. Director Martin Ritt lets the scenes flow at a leisurely pace with only some subplots threatening to interrupt the flow such as the cocaine addiction of the band's guitarist. All in all Paris Blues was one of the most pleasant surprises I've seen in a while. P.S. As a longtime Louisiana resident I have to take note of both New Orleans native Armstrong and LSU graduate Woodard in their only film together.

I really don't understand why this film isn't better known because it features a terrific cast and has some outstanding music as well as being a lot more sexual and mature than a lot of films made during this period.The main reason to watch this are for the performances and especially the chemistry of Newman and Woodward. The couple was already married by the time they made this and that chemistry between them just jumps right off the screen and especially the sexual tension between the two. Newman is very good in his rather grumpy role and he nails that part perfectly but he also nails the romantic side. Poitier is basically playing second fiddle here but it's still a lot of fun seeing him and Newman work together. Carroll is excellent in her supporting role and it was a lot of fun seeing Louis Armstrong.The Jazz music score is perfect and I thought the film did a terrific job at playing up the Paris nightlife and the life of two musicians who are up all night. I thought the four stars had an excellent chemistry together and it makes for their journey to be quite entertaining. It also doesn't hurt that the film also deals with race relations without beating the viewing over the head.

Have you died and gone to heaven? Well if you're Joanne Woodward and Diahann Carroll you are in heaven at least until you get a slap of reality. But man that's the vacation of a lifetime.Woodward and Carroll are Lillian and Connie from the U.S. on vacation in Paris. The first day Lillian recognizes jazz musician Ram Bowen Newman who is trying to pick up Connie. He invites them to see him play at the club some time. Of course they don't waste any time getting over there. There Connie meets Eddie Poitier part of the group. They pair up  RamLillian and EddieConnie. For Ram it's an affair for the straightforward honest Lillian she's hoping for more. For Eddie and Connie it seems to be the real thing.Connie as a young black woman is also an activist and she feels that Eddie has run away to Paris instead facing the conditions for blacks at home and working to make them better. In Paris of course he's freer and accepted. He loves the city but he also loves Connie. Her home is the U.S. Ram is ambitious for his music  he has written a serious piece and wants to see how far he can go with his talent.This is a wonderful film far more than a romance accompanied by some amazing music played by Louis Armstrong and and other musicians and composed by Duke Ellington. The movie beautifully captures the Paris of the early '60s in black and white its smoky clubs the people who live in the night and the love Parisians had for American jazz which would be fading soon.Poitier and Newman have great chemistry together as do both malefemale couples. Newman is hot sexy and egocentric Carroll is dropdead gorgeous and intelligent Poitier is thoughtful and handsome Woodward forthright and aggressive. They are all wonderful.See this film. It might actually convince you that for a while like Lillian and Connie you were in heaven.".

The planet has been decimated by nuclear war in the late 21st century leaving only two nations  the United Federation of Britain and the Colony. Douglas Quaid Farrell is a factory worker with a stable job and a loving wife Beckinsale but upon learning that a company named Rekall could grant him the memory of the ultimate espionage adventure he decides that a virtual vacation is better than no vacation at all. But in the midst of having the new memories implanted something goes haywire. Still strapped to the chair as the system breaks down he's branded a spy as the authorities close in and quickly flees for his life.

He heads to Rekall where vacations come in the form of memory transplants. In the process of becoming his own secret agent Quaid discovers that his life is a lie. Wife Lori Kate Beckinsale filling in for Sharon Stone but doubling for Michael Ironside and offering the best performance of the film leads a chase to capture the awakened Quaid. Meanwhile freedom fighter Melina Jessica Biel attempts to persuade Quaid into finding his true identity and leading the cause against oppression.This version of Total Recall does feature some upgrades. Of course visuals have come a long way. Where the original only had one computeranimated sequence involving primitive animated Xrays this version has all the bells and whistles. There are maglev cars a myriad of elevators and a multitude of future housing developments. The art direction is noteworthy albeit not entirely original these days. You can see a frame of the 1990 version and understand immediately what you're looking at with its consumerready technology do the same with this movie and it's another film looking back at Blade Runner. Fight sequences and most of the action come across as deft if not too numerous.The omission of the plot to free mars creates a chasm of asinine edits. The people at peril are never characterized. Since they aren't sassy mutants there's trouble in understanding the context of early fan service. Only two inhabitable territories exist in the world. The Colony as it's called Australia fills in for Mars but since it's the early setting of the film there isn't anything majestic about reaching it. The film hops between the Colony and the controlling British Federation with early going ease that it fails to divide acts.The lack of Arnold Schwarzenegger helps one appreciate Arnold Schwarzenegger. For someone considered a bad actor we never actually won a Razziehe actually got an honorary Razzie for failing to win the award but did get a Golden Globe. Like Sylvester Stallone Schwarzenegger's typical role at the time of the 1990 original exuded masculinity. However the difference is in the touches of humor that always cropped up in the Schwarzenegger films. One can't watch Predator without shouting to get to the chopper. Transversely Stallone's Rambo never brings the fun factor. Looking back at Total Recall 1990 little touches from Arnold make even the most gratuitous of Paul Verhoeven gore strangely comical. That odd nature interjects the ardor today's films overlook. This remake is clinical. No mars no mutants no soul.".

There were plenty of action sequences and most of the time the film gave us eye candy that we haven't seen before.

	schema:headline " Total Rehash";
	schema:reviewBody "Fond memories of Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall kept coming back while watching this remake. Arnold Schwarzenegger's screen presence was also an added plus in the 1990 film as well as the oneliners Mars and of course heaps of bloody violence. If you've seen the original then you know how it goes.Len Wiseman's remake of the same name replaces Arnold with Colin Farrell in his first lead action role in years while eliminating Mars as the backdrop of the action and replacing it with an overpopulated Earth where transportation from one corner to another occurs literally straight through the center of the earth. The rugged subterranean mazes of the red planet is replaced with dizzying skyscrapers and lots of sleek flying cars not unlike Philip K. Dick's own Blade Runner and Minority Report.Farrell can act and is definitely a strong action lead and it shows here as per the beautiful ladies Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel who both show off brawn over beauty here. Alas everything is taken way too seriously in this version. I have fonder memories of the VerhoevenArnold version where oneliners come postArniekill. Gone. Certain characters are trimmed or even cut completely from the original. Bryan Cranston's Cohaagen makes me miss Ronny Cox even more and Bill Nighy's resistance leader doesn't stand out compared to the 1990 film. The best thing the screenwriters did is to combine Sharon Stone's and Michael Ironside's characters from the 1990 film into one and as portrayed by Kate Beckinsale she kicks serious ass here.The script is a near complete rehash of the original save for the setting and the final act of the film. The scene where Bokeem Woodbine's character tries to convince Quaid Farrell where he's still in a dream is certainly a standout scene which was very well done. Alas the majority of the movie is laced with action sequences and sensational special effects seriously this is CGI porn that may get this film a nomination for Best Visual Effects this year. No kidding. While the editing is fastpaced and the cinematography sleek with a little too much lens flare ala J. J. Abrams the music score by Harry Gregson Williams was kind of bland in my opinion. It was just there does its job and I didn't care. Where's Marco Beltrami or even for that matter his legendary mentor the late great Jerry Goldsmith when you need them?Director Wiseman has a knack for action sequences Underworld Die Hard 4 and it shows aplenty here. Sadly the script could've been a whole lot better but then again if they had set it on Mars it would've been a shotforshot remake with better characters but still I would've loved to see action on the Red planet once again. The PG13 rating is justified and there are indeed little homages to the original but overall this remake is nothing more than a fastpaced popcorn munching good waste of time with some really nice CGI to chew on.However I'd rather watch the old one again. Arnie has a much stronger screen presence than Farrell and it is much more ambitious and has more heart than this sleeker newer one.Overall rating 53".

It was all in all a great movie.This remake forgot the entire element of fun and instead replaced it with what the producers probably thought people wanted to see more explosions. It's just simply put bleh.It's not very fun to watch. It's actually pretty boring in the scenes where there isn't action and the scenes where there is action it begins to get old very quickly. I don't ever feel like it's my place to critique another person's acting but there are a few exceptions. Farrell just doesn't seem like a great Quaid. He kind of just takes everything that is thrown at him and gets over it. Schwarzenegger was thrown into the action and was always surprised with what came next. He wasn't ever ready and that showed. It made it more exciting! Farrell always kind of keeps that yeah I'm a secret agent? okay. attitude going the entire movie. The last thing You have almost no doubt that Quaid is actually a secret agent in this one. The old one actually had you thinking it was possible that he was still back at Rekall whereas the remake spells it out in the beginning He is a secret agent. That's it. End of story. The point of the old Total Recall was that you were never really sure. Is it all fake? Or is it real? The remake completely missed that intrigue which was a big part of the old one. It will entertain the people who like action and nothing else. The substance just isn't there which is a bit of a letdown. I give it a four because it looked pretty.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess the floodgates are now open. Adapting Philip K. Dick's stories are no longer enough and now a trend may follow either to remake the films that have already been done to give it another spin for a new generation or how about remaking all of the films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger starting from Conan and now Total Recall. For sure Colin Farrell can't step into the exMr Universe's hulking frame in playing the construction worker turned double agent Douglas Quaid through what would seem like a fantasy walk in the park for the mind gone all wrong but if you'd put away your memory of the past film then his outing here would stand out against his recent slate of projects bringing him back to actionhero mould even if Len Wiseman's vision here turned a little bit suspect.Fans of the original film will see only slight similarities in this one since it took on a different adventure altogether after the familiar introduction. Quaid experiencing a nightmare of a dream only to wake up beside the sexy wife in Lori Kate Beckinsale in a role played by Sharon Stone previously in lingerie no less and finding that there's probably more to life than just home and work. Enticed by the fantasy inducing company called Rekall where one can live out one's fantasy for a fee Douglas soon discovers he got more than he bargained for. The contraption's design got brought over and so did the cult favourite in the three breasted woman which Singapore back then didn't get to see at all because our censors found it offensive and unreal. The identity mask also has another go although with less fun being solely functional and little else.But what was sorely missed in this remake is the quip after quip of Arnieisms those puns made each time Douglas Quaid did something smart alecky dispatched an opponent or just wanted to drawl on something in his Austrian accent. In the typical Arnie movie there's always room for fun jokes and those legendary one liners. Here all we get are dead serious moments with the whole look and feel being laden with the need to feel all gritty. Colin Farrell wears a scowl throughout being perplexed and confused about his true identity in Jason Bourne style complete with mysterious artifacts stored in a safe deposit box and having doubts to the role he has to play in the entire battle between the Haves and Have Nots.This Total Recall requires that you junk all memories of the Schwarzenegger film in order to enjoy the new narrative involving a chemical fallout across all lands save for Britain and parts of Europe now being part of a Greater Britain and Australia known as The Colony yes some slight historical references here. There's no Mars this time round as the story gets set strictly on Earth involving a carnival styled train service that commutes between the two territories having to pass adjacent to the Earth's core for some nifty CG effects involving gravitational force reversal.CG seemed to be what Director Len Wiseman ordered for the film with green screen effects and CG laden landscapes peppering the entire movie that makes you wonder about the tagline What is real? indeed. It's big on action sequences and slight on actual story with pauses only to allow the film to breathe a little before embarking on yet another stunt sequence that involves plenty of running for Douglas Quaid and his new found love interest  revolutionary partner Melina Jessica Biel as they escape from rooftops to elevators pass through deadly three dimensional elevator shafts and tunnels fighting their way past synthetic troopers ala Star Wars. It does get pretty generic after a while that these sequences all start to look very much the same and probably a Star Wars Clone Wars episode gone wrong.Also for the tagline of What is real? this remake doesn't really keep you in suspense in a what is and what is not thought because for this new generation of audiences Len Wiseman probably considered it best if everything was spoonfed. So there's no need to guess and everything got explained verbatim that you'd know whether it's real otherwise and just about every plot and character twist being laid out for all and sundry. Between the two female leads Kate Beckinsale got more screen time for obvious reasons though it's not everyday that we get to see her in a negative role. It's clearly expanded here with her Melina being something of an amalgam of the roles played by Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside as the relentless pursuer of Douglas Quaid adamant in hunting him down and finishing him off against orders.Ultimately Total Recall 2012 is one big amusement park ride. This will probably be enjoyable for anyone in for an average CG action adventure extravaganza and have no knowledge of the fun blockbuster the first one was but for the rest of us who have seen Paul Verhoeven's version this one definitely pales in comparison in story action and just plain fun. And Arnold Schwarzenegger was in his prime then with big shoes that didn't get filled this time round.".

What's even more annoying is that the main bad guy is a depraved Tefloncoated wonder woman who can easily beat the stuffing out of our hero despite the fact he also happens to be a professionally trained killer with muscles the size of bowling balls. Throughout the entire movie this wonder woman just keeps coming back like a pesty stalker. Hardly getting a scratch until the very end. I was even waiting for her to start talking like Clint Eastwood! She also enjoyed explaining herself too much and I was really hoping she would get dispatched ASAP because her presence was undermining the entire story!I have to admit I cared about the good guys! I wanted them to win but unlike the first Total Recall I didn't care nearly as much. In the original film I desperately wanted the good guys to win! In the remake my feelings were muted. After all the remake has been dumbeddown which makes it dull. Sure there's plenty of CGI eye candy and plenty of Clone Troopertype guys in body armor getting miraculously mowed down at every corner. But the story is not edgy in the least! Unlike the original Total Recall where you really didn't know if the good guys were going to win.And the remake has no message unlike the original. The original was about mindbogglingly oppressive corporate greed and as a result you felt a wide range of strong emotions! So much was at stake!I don't like it when a great story is reduced to so many campy clichs! There was great tension building in the first half of the film only to fall apart later! It's so obvious Hollywood focusgrouped the screenplay to death in order to pander to the teen and preteen boy segment of the movie going public! Too bad Philip K. Dick will be spinning in his grave tonight. Whoever owns the film rights to his stories should be ashamed of themselves and PLEASE make no more movies if this is the best you can do! Try to protect the man's legacy instead!".

After all the remake has been dumbeddown which makes it dull. Sure there's plenty of CGI eye candy and plenty of Clone Troopertype guys in body armor getting miraculously mowed down at every corner. But the story is not edgy in the least! Unlike the original Total Recall where you really didn't know if the good guys were going to win.And the remake has no message unlike the original. The original was about mindbogglingly oppressive corporate greed and as a result you felt a wide range of strong emotions! So much was at stake!I don't like it when a great story is reduced to so many campy clichs! There was great tension building in the first half of the film only to fall apart later! It's so obvious Hollywood focusgrouped the screenplay to death in order to pander to the teen and preteen boy segment of the movie going public! Too bad Philip K. Dick will be spinning in his grave tonight. Whoever owns the film rights to his stories should be ashamed of themselves and PLEASE make no more movies if this is the best you can do! Try to protect the man's legacy instead!";

I was expecting an overdose of action and a confusing plot.I was pleasantly surprised by Colin Farrel's acting. I feel he has really improved as an actor and I thought the chemistry between him and costars Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel was great. The action sequences were fun to watch and exciting. Fast paced action sequences kept me refreshed and the stunning Kate Beckinsale who you may know from 'Underworld' and 'Van Helsing' nailed the antagonist role.The director Len Wiseman who previously surprised by making 'Live Free or Die Hard' a fantastic action film has once again done his job well. The storyline was clear and made sense which was more than what I had expected. I admit that it could have been better because the climax was kind of dull compared to the rest of the movie but definitely worth the watch.".

And seriously can you really say that you would have given the Arnie version a 10 if you saw it today come on now.The action sequences were great. The fighting choreography was good. In all honesty I think Kate Beckinsale is one of the better female action stars out there I mean she can really kick ass. Well the CG was awesome. The interpretation of the future was well though out. I especially liked that there were cars hovering and not flying using a magnetic levitation system very realistic look into the future of transportation. The plot was decent and this is where it loses 1 star. I thought it did a great job adapting Philip K. Dick's science fiction story into it's own. However I thought that it followed too similar in plot sequence of the 1990 film. It would have been a 10 for me otherwise. I wished that they could have really gone another way making it a complete mind f that would just blow our minds away. They could really had more fun with the memory thing. Overall great action film and worth seeing. Just don't compare it to the 1990 film.".

I think that people who have seen the original Schwarzenegger version will not be too thrilled with this film me included. In the original film there were more mind games while this film is diluted with action sequences. I am not saying that the action parts were not good there was just too many of them. I have to say that the futuristic look of the United Federation of Britain and The Colony Australia was pretty cool although there were times that I thought that I was watching a video game. Also the concept that you could travel between the two locations which are on opposite sides of the earth in roughly 17 minutes in a tube called The Fall was utterly ridiculous. I can't even imagine how fast that thing would have to travel to do what it does. Colin Farrell Douglas QuaidHauser was not all that engaging. This is not necessarily his fault because the dialog was pretty bland and boring. By the end of the film I really did not care what happened to him I just wanted it to be over. Kate Beckinsale Lori Quaid and Jessica Biel Melina were formidable as two buttkicking adversaries although I have to say that Kate's character kind of reminded me of the female terminator. She was relentless in trying to track down Hauser. I am always happy to see a woman cast as a tough larger than life super human. Bokeem Woodbine Harry was convincing enough as the best friend but his dialog was no better than Colin's. I do not think that the film was all bad but about an hour or so into the film I was wishing that I was back at ReKall. You are definitely going to need an energy drink after you watch this one because you will not be energized after seeing it you will be worn out. Len Wiseman was definitely not a wise man for trying to redo this film. He should stick with the Underworld series and call it a day. This film really makes me long for Mars and the cheesy special effects in the original. I am giving this film a very weak amber light only because the action scenes were so well done.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is an action fans wet dream. It steams from action scene to action scene with a small pause for dialogue and plot. There's many will say this is a bad thing but not me. I hate long drawn out rhetoric in an action film. So if you like action in your action films you will love this.If your looking for an up dated version of Arnie's Total Recall then you will be disappointed but then what would be the point of seeing the exact same film again just with new characters? It needed to pay homage but also be a little bit unique and new. This managers that with ease.There's no Mars in this one. Its set in a future where much of the world is uninhabitable and there's really just the United Kingdom and Australia The colony's left. Travel between the two just takes 17 minutes by falling through a hole that travels through the centre of the earth. Which features as a major plot point.The acting's OK by Farrell and Beil and they both give a good strong action performance however the true star is Kate Beckinsale's role as his fake wife then ardent nemesis. Kate show's she's best in the full on action roles and is totally believable as a hard as nails kick ass ruthless pursuer. She's absolutely brilliant in every scene she's in. From the ambiguous but memorable line I give good wife to her die hard relentless attempts to kill Farrell she is definitely the true star of this movie. I definitely want to see her in more action movies.From the point of keeping you thrilled this film scores 10 out of ten from an acting view point I give Beckinsale 1010 and the others 810. The CGI is definitely 1010 even if the first scenes are so very reminiscent of blade runner. The action stunts and fight scenes are well above a 1010 rating. In short this would be a perfect film if not for some silly plot holes.Now here's where the plot gets a bit silly. Douglas Quaid Colin Farrell lives in the UK travels by the fall to work in the colonies where he's building synthetic soldiers that will be transported back to the UK to eventually use to invade the colonies via the fall. There are terrorists who feel the fall generates second class citizens but no explanation why. UK owns the colonies who are trying for independence but are still owned by the UK so why does the UK need to invade it? Quaid as Hauser has supposedly seen a kill code for the synthetic soldiers if so why when he was first turned didn't he give it too the resistance. In this version he wasn't a pretend double agent he genuinely changed sides so why didn't he give it then? And as everyone seems to have recall technology why can only the leader of the resistance Matthias Bill Nighy get at it? Why endanger him? If anything Matthais roles seems to have been forced into the script from the original but doesn't actually fit in this versions plot or premise. The the final annoying glaringly obvious plot hole. When the UK invades the colonies they load all their troops into the fall device and fall through the earth. The colonies know the invasion is coming through the fall we see news casts and alerts to the citizens warning them of the imminent invasion. So if they know its coming via the fall why not simply drop a bomb down the hole? Instantly kill the complete army and even block the only means of invasion ensuring their safety? Its so obvious its ridiculous.Its this plot failure that makes me mark the overall film down to just 710. But if you don't care about that and just want an all action fun movie then this is definitely a must see film.".

	schema:headline " Well...";
	schema:reviewBody "Well reviewing this movie can be quite difficult... How am I supposed to evaluate it? As a standalone movie or as a remake? Because if you are not falling from um Mars you probably know this is a remake of one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies ever...Hmm... Let's see. How about starting with its' critical acclamation? I guess you can easily see the movie's rating on Rotten Tomatoes. If not I recommend seeing it if you want a good laugh. 30. That is it. Needless to say any sane person would be shocked. Not because the movie is too good for that rating. You don't need to like the movie... You don't even need to have seen it to know something is very very wrong here... I mean 'Die Hard 4.0' has 81... How the hell can the next movie created by the same writerdirector have almost three times lower rating? I know writersdirectors don't always make movies of equal quality but the quality NEVER fluctuates that much. A little research about RT helped me realize a few things.First critics tend to give sequels of beloved franchises high ratings  of all movies of that kind that I checked only one  'Die Hard 3'  had less than 65. Everything else  even the abysmal 'Attack of the Clones'  was rated as Fresh.Second critics tend to have a certain bias against scifi fantasy and horror if they are not directed by a supposedly great name like Ridley Scott or Nolan. 'Willow'  a fantasy genre icon  has 49. Go figure.Third Rotten Tomatoes is not even a good representative of critics' opinion... I mean does anybody believe the critics considered the last Indiana Jones movie better than 'Forrest Gump'? Check their awards and you will see. And yet.. Go and see. So much for RT being a good source...I wasted your time with this but it just had to be told. Now about the movie itself. Well it IS good. It has its' shortcomings mainly in the writing department but it stands on its' own.As a stand alone movie... Well after 'Prometheus' disappointed everyone TR2012 is probably the best scifi movie of the year. It has a great story great chemistry between the actors and the writing is at least acceptable although sometimes flawed. The acting was good from all actors. The only slight disappointment comes from Bill Nighy  he delivered a fine performance but he looked like he spent no more than an hour on the movie set. However his character although important has no more than 10 minutes of screen time so... Actionwise this movie is EXACTLY what 'Die Hard 4.0' was  relatively bloodless wonderfully captured and complicatedly choreographed. Smooth camera movement NO shaky cam extremely long cuts  look at the first fight in the trailer and you will get it. And believe me the action looks better than that on the big screen. What is also worth mentioning is the fact that the movie feels more real than most scifi blockbusters recently mostly because the use of CGI and green screens is as minimal as possible. I don't know why so many people think it is loaded with CGI. It isn't trust me.Overall as a stand alone movie the new 'Total Recall' works and it works well.As a remake... Well it did keep the basic story but that is it. Verhoeven's humor is gone. The blood is gone. The gore is gone. Mars is gone. Mutants are gone. Richter is gone. Arnold and his oneliners are gone. Although the story is basically the same the new movie is completely different from the original. There are a few nods to the 1990 movie but that is it. This is a new movie.If you want to see the old one see it. It is great. If you haven't seen it you will love it. If you already have seen it... you will love it again.The new movie is different. If you see it with an open mind you will probably like it at least a bit. Give it a chance. It is a good movie and a great entertainment.".

	onyx:emotionText "Well reviewing this movie can be quite difficult... How am I supposed to evaluate it? As a standalone movie or as a remake? Because if you are not falling from um Mars you probably know this is a remake of one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies ever...Hmm... Let's see. How about starting with its' critical acclamation? I guess you can easily see the movie's rating on Rotten Tomatoes. If not I recommend seeing it if you want a good laugh. 30. That is it. Needless to say any sane person would be shocked. Not because the movie is too good for that rating. You don't need to like the movie... You don't even need to have seen it to know something is very very wrong here... I mean 'Die Hard 4.0' has 81... How the hell can the next movie created by the same writerdirector have almost three times lower rating? I know writersdirectors don't always make movies of equal quality but the quality NEVER fluctuates that much. A little research about RT helped me realize a few things.First critics tend to give sequels of beloved franchises high ratings  of all movies of that kind that I checked only one  'Die Hard 3'  had less than 65. Everything else  even the abysmal 'Attack of the Clones'  was rated as Fresh.Second critics tend to have a certain bias against scifi fantasy and horror if they are not directed by a supposedly great name like Ridley Scott or Nolan. 'Willow'  a fantasy genre icon  has 49. Go figure.Third Rotten Tomatoes is not even a good representative of critics' opinion...

This was the closest that I have ever come to walking out midway through a movie. The only reason we stayed until the end was that we invested 25 for the tickets and felt stubbornly compelled to stick it out.

What new age mumbo jumbo is this?Another problem with the flick is the casting of Farrell. In the original Arnie looked really confused by what was happening around him and viewers would have empathized with his predicament.Farrell on the other hand just seems to be going through the motion.The movie's atmosphere is also nothing new. The teeming crowds amid the rain come from 'Blade Runner' and 'Fifth Element'. The carchase scene comes from 'Minority Report' and 'Fifth Element'.The idea about robot cops getting ready for an invasion comes from 'I Robot' and the look of the robots also comes this flick. The one good thing about this flick is Kate Beckinsale the director's wife who plays Quaid's wife. She's not one person viewers will want to mess with in a dark alley.

It's just 120 minutes of Colin running away from the bad guys with no break for a plot.

Seriously it's that stupid.The fact that this terrible movie shares the same name as the mysterious and intriguing SchwarzeneggerStone film of 1990 is an absolute insult. There is no suspense mystery or intrigue in this version of Total Recall. Both the central character and certainly the audience pretty well know the real situation from the beginning. So rather than sharing in the doubts of the central character who in the 1990 original isn't sure what is real and what isn't we instead simply get formulaic action mixed with a bit of romance. So don't forget your barf bag if you dare see this abysmal stinkbomb. This movie is an insult to everyone's intelligence.".

The pace of the film was fantastic with never a dull moment. Effects made the whole thing look real which it clearly wasn't. Robots looked a bit too much like Star Wars stormtroopers crossed with those in IRobot which was a bit strange.But the best thing about this film Two stunning brunettes that oozed sex appeal throughout. Only dilemma which one to add to my friends list and who to bounce. I've decided to cheat and add them both under one entry as a threesome.The story CGI and everything else would make this an 89 out of 10 but the ladies make this film at least a 12 out of 10!".

	schema:reviewBody "I still can't point out what it is about Hail Caesar that I hated so much. On the surface it feels like a harmless comedy.  Obviously lame but harmless.  But it keeps gnawing at you from the insides to the point where you just have difficulty watching it straightthrough.  I had to watch it in three or four separate viewings.  I just couldn't sit through this lamebrain fluff for longer than thirty minutes!I found this movie in the 4.88 bin so naturally I wasn't expecting the Best Picture Winner for 1993 but I was curious about HC ever since I first heard about it.  So I decided What the heck? and bought it along with a bunch of other discount videos at my local wholesale market.  I'm sure Anthony Michael Hall gets cracked on a lot and many consider him a hasbeen.  I still think he's a cool actor.  I liked him a lot in Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club.  And recently he showed off his talents as an adult actor in The Caveman's Valentine.  He's definitely a man with potential but as for carrying on a starring role and directing?  I don't think so.  This directorial debut and thankfully his only time directing screams amateur from start to finish.  Almost like a mediocre student film meant to be enjoyed strictly by fellow students. The big stars don't help much either.  Sam Jackson is one of my favorite actors and he appears briefly as a postman constantly getting chased by Julius' Hall dog.  He's good in this small supporting role but he's not on screen enough to save the film.  Old brat pack buddy Judd Nelson also has a supporting role and so does Robert Downey Jr. in his most hammy performance as a hyperkinetic wannabe music agent.  Jackson Nelson and Downey all appear very shortly but since marketing always finds ways to capitalize on the success of nowbig stars all three of them appear on the video cover.  The attempts at humor are totally lame though I have to thank Hall a little bit for not being annoying about it.  There's too many overdone annoying comedies nowadays and that's the only reason why I'm going to thank himeven though the humor is way below par and only intermittently funny. The plot is very disorganized.  It keeps on hopping from one subplot to another and I can never get thoroughly involved.  In the beginning we're psyched up to thinking this is going to be about Julius and his dream to make the perfect band.  But that gets pushed off to the side way too often. It mostly composes of an outlandishly predictable pseudolove story between Julius and his wouldbe girlfriend Bobbie Phillips and her snobby whitecollar father who will do anything to make sure nothing happens between the two of them.  The problem is like all these stories go the girl he's in love with...is a total bizotch!!!!  There's not one appealing quality about her other than the looks.  Throughout the film they don't do as much as come close to each other.  How did the two of them get together in the first place?  Yet he's in the band with this beautiful girl Leslie Danon who obviously been wanting him since they first met eyes.  And here's the bonus  she's not a total bizotch!  Every once in a while there comes a lost movie that happens to be really good.  And you think to yourself Why has this movie been hidden for all these years?  This is not one of those movies.  It has its very brief moments.  That's all I have to say.  All you Brat Pack fanatics eager to see more of Anthony Michael Hall's work better off buying the original B.P. features or rent them again.  I'm hoping he will totally revive his career one of these days but if this was an attempt for a revivalSorry try again.  My score  3 out of 10".

How he got the freedom and financing to direct produce and star in a movie when Judd Nelson's career disappeared is beyond me. In my humble opinion Hall is not a pimple on Nelson's hind end to paraphrase Joe Seneca in Crossroads. Furthermore it is hard to take anyone seriously who appears to have made a serious effort at looking like Corey Haim.In addition the production values suck. The editing sucks.

Seeing this movie the reason for this is pretty obvious. To be fair he was working with a pretty low budget which is pretty evident throughout. For example in several scenes with two people talking he never shows a shot of the two characters in the same shot  he just shot each actor alone and edited both sets of footage together. But the problems of Hail Caesar go beyond the low budget. All of the characters in the movie are annoying and obnoxious and the movie doesn't know whether to be a satire of the music business or a goofy comedy about a youth trying to win over the father of his girlfriend. If you are thinking of giving this movie a try because of its cast a word of warning Samuel L. Jackson Robert Downey Jr. and Judd Nelson each just have a few minutes of screen time.

	schema:headline " A great film";
	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday I rewatched The Wedding Night 1935 this time with my wife who had never seen it before. For me it was like watching it all over again for the first time. I think that this happens with great pictures like this one. She also loved the film and I felt so gratified by that because sadly this type of quiet sensitive films is not the kind of film which you can watch with anybody and can be fully appreciated as it should be.I'm a fan of the Gary Cooper of the late '20s and 1930s in my opinion some his best films were made around this time before his definitive screen persona was established especially in the early thirties. He gives a sensitive balanced nuanced performance in a film that looks like a slice of life. His character is so unarchetypical so honestly portrayed by him that you get immersed totally in this beautiful love story. And this is no by chance because the film was directed by the masterful King Vidor.Praise must also go to the two actresses that vividly portray the two women in Cooper's life the unjustly forgotten and underrated Russian actress Anna Sten and the equally unfairly forgotten actress Helen Vinson. Miss Vinson portrays without falling in the caricature a shallow but at the same time likable society woman who thinks that life is a neverending party and does not take marriage as seriously as it should be taken realizing it too late. Miss Sten plays the nave but strongwilled Polish woman who reluctantly at first begins to fall for the writer portrayed by Cooper. The scene in which Cooper reads to her the first chapters of the new autobiographical book he is writing is most telling in this aspect because Miss Sten does not fall for the dashing tall handsome Cooper but for his character's sensitiveness feelings and emotions which she apprehends by means of this book in progress.In short none of the three principals of this story incur in stereotypical portrayals which helped me to connect with their characters' emotions with its virtues and flaws.A wonderful experience which with no doubt I'll repeat in the future because this film deserves many viewings and is just my kind of film a simple love story unpretentiously directed that does not aim at over sentimentality and does not fall into the maudlin which can ruin a movie with superb unaffected performances by the leads.".

	schema:headline " Solid effort from Cooper and Vidor";
	schema:reviewBody "I had no expectations for this movie before I saw it expect a high regard for Gary Cooper and director King Vidor and neither disappointed me in this nice effort from them.As mentioned before this story concerns married writer Gary Cooper one not unlike F. Scott Fitzgerald  who has lost his groove and had his latest novel rejected by his publisher. He is forced to give up his Manhattan apartment and move back to the abandoned family homestead in Connecticut. There he meets a community of Polish immigrants and slowly falls in love with beautiful young Polish girl Anna Sten who he had hired to help around the house.My first thought about this movie as I watched it was that the leading man was more beautiful than the leading lady as Gary Cooper certainly looked fabulous and was photographed with great sensitivity. Cooper in his modern American clothes certainly had the upper hand over Sten who was always wearing dowdy traditional Eastern European dresses and hats. She was almost completely covered up in these costumes for the duration and it would have been a treat to see her in American garb.The speed that Cooper's character falls in love with the young girl is questionable especially considering he has a beautiful funny and intelligent wife played by Helen Vinson. Perhaps it's the Polish girl's youth and innocence he's attracted to but I think he's not as heroic as the moviemakers intend him to be. The wife does leave him alone in snowy New England to work on his novel but he needn't stab her in the back by falling in love with another. Cooper's character comes off somewhat of a cad and I never was able to sympathize with him enough to make me really care about his final happiness.The movie paints the wife as a shallow but glamorous socialite caring only for the next party of getaway weekend at his expense. But at about twothirds into the movie and after she has read his manuscript she has a strong and wonderful scene with Sten where she discusses the hypothetical endings for the novel. Vinson really shines in this scene which includes one incredibly long take with at least three pages of dialog. I thought both Vinson and the oftenmaligned Sten made it all work very nicely. This was the moment when you can see the strength under the airy facade of Vinson's character.The movie takes a very dark turn partway through and some of the scenes really rise to the level of verbal and physical abuse something I hadn't expected to see. But the production values are great Greg Toland's camera work shines and the locations and sets are really convincing.But what somewhat bothered me in its intensity were these two scenes with Sten and her family. How brutal is the scene where her father and Ralph Bellamy want her to watch Bellamy slaughter pigs? I mean she said about 5 times that it makes her sick and they kept insisting. And then finally after she runs off  she and the audience get to hear the sound effect of pigs squealing as they're being butchered. Didn't expect this movie to go there...And then when her father who was introduced as an amiable figure gets so angry at Sten that he slaps her face with such intensity. Seemed pretty violent by today's standards...Finally I admire and still wonder about the ambiguous ending. Obviously the Polish girl has died. Vinson is standing next to Cooper as he gazes out the window. She speaks to him and then he remembers aloud how Sten would look coming up to the house. He sees her in his imagination. The camera pulls back and now Vinson is no longer in the room or the scene. Did she leave him after all? Did she decide she didn't want to stay with a man who had such a love for another woman?".

She plays her part so believable it'll make you wonder why she never hit it big in Hollywood. She never caught on after this film and she faded into obscurity but when you see this you'll be blown away at how good she was. Such a wasted talent.

Not long after they arrive he gets a visit from neighbors Anna Sten and her father who want to buy a section of land from him. He agrees and comes into money. The wife is quite happy and decides she wants to go back to NY...where she likes it. He agrees and lets her go while he stays behind.

Hang on to your seat though you won't wanna miss any minute of this mid 30's soap opera.Without a doubt a film that deserves a serious look. I think it gets no credibility because of Gary Cooper.

Set the movie in cold weather necessitating her wearing a hat or scarf much of the time. Cast the urbane Ralph Bellamy as her roughhewn Polish fianc.Anna Sten had a lovely face and she wasn't a bad actress. But this vehicle could have sunk any unknown. On the other hand it's not a bad movie. In some ways it's memorable.The male lead is Gary Cooper in his early days when his lashes were long his look lanky but gentle. He's very good as a writer who's hit a brick wall with his work. He and wife Helen Vinson are splitsville or near it so he goes to his family house in Connecticut. And there he meets Sten who is delivering milk. No comment. I never got the whole big deal about Garbo. Sten is more emotive. But she's sunk in this movie.".

With all this time spent together they begin to have feelings for each other. But she is engaged to Ralph Bellamy kind of that is as father has been arranging it for some time. But she doesn't love him. Such begins a no win situation. What begins as a very romantic and involving film turns into tragedy I didn't see coming. Granted Gary was already married. But really this gets bad! No one's happy at the end. A very enjoyable and well made film is marred by an abrupt ending. Even Helen Vinson is especially good as the wronged wife who gives one of her best performances aside from Paul Muni's film I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. You'll love this film like I did  up to the last minute but be prepared for a downbeat ending.".

But her father has already promised her hands in marriage to another farmer Ralph Bellamy and when problems erupt between Cooper and Vinson he finds himself falling in love with Sten and she longs to get out of this arranged marriage. But an agreement in the old world is an agreement and any chance of getting what they wish could lead to tragedy.This very sweet and simple tale has all the elements for great drama but somehow it never really rises to the heights which it is trying to attain. The leads are young and attractive and the plot moves briskly but even with excellent production design and direction by the masterful King Vidor it still lacks that magic that could have made it explode into something special. I think that occurs because there really is no chemistry between Cooper and Sten and their unsympathetic partners Vinson and Bellamy are not really fleshed out as characters. It also gives the impression that poor European immigrants were lead by an uncompassionate papa and a quietly dignified mama who always suffered in silence. In these roles Sig Ruman and Esther Dale seem more like stereotypes than real people. Walter Brennan adds some zest to a few scenes as another local but the end result is a drama that seems like something Lillian Gish may have starred in during the silent era.".

Especially when Cooper sat on the end of the bed during his conversation which was by itself quite the fuss back thanwith the girl. Overall the story also gives an interesting review of immigration and the nation's feelings about it. Hard work was certainly central to the movie's theme and of course the end is tragic as the guy doesn't get the girl.".

Then there is the tragedy that ends the movie.When I was watching the movie I was wondering where this movie was filmed. There is no filming location listed in IMDb. It is quite obvious that there are several outdoor scenes not on a sound stage.A lovely movie. I enjoyed it tremendously.".

The overriding impression was that she was beautiful but had the acting talent of an amoeba with learning difficulties. Now that I have seen her at last in a film produced around the time Goldwyn was actively promoting her I realise how wrong it was to believe the misinformation of the day. The fact is she was a fine actress and clearly Porter was exaggerating her speech problems to serve his lyric as it happens she possessed a fine speaking voice and had no problem with English. If anyone is miscast here it is Ralph Bellamy who is about as convincing as a Polish farmer as Percy Kilbride would be as a Boston Brahmin. The plot has Manhattan sophisticate Gary Cooper moving into his family home in Connecticut and falling for the Polish girl Sten on the farm next door. If anything Sten turns in the best performance in a film that boasts in addition to Cooper Helen Vinson Sig Ruman and Walter Brennan. On the strength of this performance I intend to seek out other movies featuring Sten.".

	schema:headline " hubba hubba Gary Cooper";
	schema:reviewBody "Nothing gets a woman's heart pumping a little quicker than an early Gary Cooper movie and The Wedding Night from 1935 is no exception.Cooper is writer Tony Barratt  think F. Scott Fitzgerald  whose publisher doesn't want his next book and tells him whatever he had he's lost it. So he and his wife Dora Helen Vinson take off for an inherited country home. Tony becomes intrigued by the family of Polish migrs who live nearby particularly the beautiful daughter Manya Novak Sten.Okay here is something that confuses me. My friends are of Polish descent. They called their sister Mary Manya. So far so good.This family's last name is Novak. That's Czech.And they say Dasvidaniya which is Russian. Go figure.Back to the story. After the father Sig Ruman buys a field from Tony for 5000 Dora wants to hightail it back to New York now that they have some money. Tony decides to stay. He begins writing a book about the family.He and Manya fall in love though it's unconsummated. She is engaged to Fredrik Sobieski Ralph Bellamy a real bumpkin whom she doesn't love. When she decides not to marry him her father has a fit and the engagement is back on. Meanwhile Tony wants a divorce.Bittersweet film with lovely performances by Cooper and Sten. Cooper in the beginning is immaculate in a suit and he and Dora are part of the highclass social set. He did play many sophisticated roles in the '30s but Mr. Deeds and westerns would follow. Instead of strong and silent here he's animated and romantic.This film was apparently supposed to introduce Anna Sten to American audiences. Sam Goldwyn wanted to build her up as the next Garbo. I don't know about you but I don't remember Greta Garbo playing a farmer with dowdy clothes. If he was going to build her up why not showcase her beauty? She was beautiful and her acting is very good. To me she hasn't the presence of Garbo or Dietrich but I think Goldwyn could have given her better treatment.Helen Vinson really has the strongest role and she was up to it.Very poignant story directed by King Vidor and beautifully photographed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like Gary Cooper filmshe was an excellent actor and usually starred in wonderful films. However this one is very forgettable and I just felt bored as I watched it. While the film isn't BAD it is pretty much just a timepasser.Cooper plays a funloving writer. He and his wife were so busy having fun and partying in New York that they quality of his work had sharply declined and he was all but broke. As a result he decided they should move into a home in rural Connecticut. Oddly Connecticut in this film looks nothing like I expected it to lookit was all tobacco farm land and at times blizzards. His wife is a spoiled lady and soon she leaves along with the household staff. So a neighbor lady Anna Sten comes to help with housekeeping and a romance begins to bloomeven though he's still married and she's engaged to Ralph Bellamy. By the way as usual because Bellamy is in the film you know that he and Sten will never live happily ever after as man and wife! This is because no actor in the history of Hollywood ever cast as a fianc and left all alone at the end of the film like Bellamy. He must have played this role in about a dozen films so there isn't a lot of suspense in this regardthough he gets closer to getting the girl and living happily ever after than in most of these films.The film is in some ways like a PreCode film even though when it came out the Production Code had just come into its own. That's because the main theme is about married man Cooper falling in love with a woman who is engaged to be marriedsomething you just wouldn't see in later Hollywood films of the 1930s. However you can also see that since the Code was just created the film ended in a way that was in line with the spirit of the Hays Officethe love between Cooper and Sten COULD not be acted upon. So in many ways this film is like a transition between Pre and PostCode films.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is Die Feuerzangenbowle and most people who hear the title and know about film will immediately think of the much older Heinz Rhmann movie. But this one we have here is the take of German filmmaker Helmut Kutner from 1970 so this one is already over 45 years old. The cast includes a handful of known names like Walter Giller who plays Rhmann's part the main character Uschi Glas Theo Lingen Rudolf Schndler or Nadja Tiller Giller's wife. And looking at how Kutner made many wellreceived films in his career then one has to say that you could actually expect something nice from this film here. But your expectations would be disappointed. Maybe comedy is not exactly Kutner's strength as many probably consider this film one of his weakest. But there is also the question that needs to be asked if they actually saw this movie. I don't think it was that bad overall to be honest. I am sure many just gave this one such a low rating because they love the Rhmann film and automatically think that there was no need for a remake and this is why they are already biased and maybe hated this film here without even seeing it. I don't know.As for me I watched the Rhmann film and this one and I found both not really appealing let alone entertaining. I guess Helmut Spoerl's novel just isn't to my liking but who knows I haven't read. But I'd be surprised to like it after I disliked both films I saw that were based on it. This is the story of a grown man who talks to his friends and decides to go back to school as he has never been there and he wants to reexperiences the awesomeness that he has been missing out according to his colleagues. Or does he really go back. Wait for the ending to find out the major plot twist. Anyway in my opinion there is no need to really see this film and it's another example of how weak German comedy was back then unfortunately. People who keep moaning that there are no great German comedies anymore may be partially right. But they are also forgetting that there are so so many weak and unfunny German comedy films from the past probably a lot more than from today. It makes me a bit sad that the inclusion of people like Lingen or Schndler who I quite like was still not enough to keep this really absurd little tale from becoming an underwhelming movie. But it's also not worse than the much more known Rhmann film so maybe if you enjoyed that one then you can also check out this one here. I myself do not give a thumbsup though and I suggest you watch something else instead.".

	schema:headline " entertaining gentle comedy from golden age of Italian films";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a gentle comedy based upon a famous Italian novel written a decade earlier by Aldo Palazzeschi. It tells the story of three elderly sisters in Florence who out of compassion invite a young nephew Remo to stay in their house and give him everything he wishes for which is a problem as the young man turns out to be a charming rascal who will ruin them. Two of the duped aunts are played by two acting sisters of certain fame in Italy. However the actress from this film most known to international audiences is probably Clara Calamai who played the leading role in a much more famous Italian film from around the same time  Ossessione by Visconti. Here she plays a quite different role as a sophisticated South American woman who arrives in Italy from Argentina and takes up with Remo. This is a short film well acted and with swift tempi. It is amazing that films such as this and Ossessione could be produced in an Italy engulfed in the later stages of the war. There is on YouTube a long Italian television version of the novel from 1972 though without subtitles. This older and shorter version on you tube with English hardsubs deserves to be more widely known to an international public.".

Together they take the train from London to Brighton to escape Kelly's hardedged pimp. The film explores the motherdaughterlike bond that forms between the girls as they are left to fend for themselves in the gritty underworld of South London.Paul Andrew Williams has done something remarkably cool here that he did not realise until his film started receiving praise and wider distribution it even made its way to the Stockholm International Film Festival where I saw it. Nevertheless we can easily tell that this is a quality film with excellent performances by its two leads Lorraine Stanley and young Georgia Groome. Although the seedy underground and hierarchies of bad guys johns and pimps channel Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughn director Williamsm stresses that London to Brighton is not a gangster movie but an unflinching look at the two aforementioned characters and how they cope under pressure.The plot is left best unspoiled because it is gradually unfolded through wellpositioned flashbacks arguably the goldmine of the film. The first half of the film has a few pacing problems as nothing truly jumps out and grabs you  but when the unspeakably effective background segments are interjected London to Brighton receives a welldeserved jumpstarting kick up the arse continuing down a perfectlypaced path. One of the most poignant scenes sees Kelly's pimp ask 11yearold Joanne if she is a virgin and subsequently telling her to have sex with an older man. The amount of smoking cursing screaming and beating that goes on around her is heartbreaking.This would not be the case with a lesser actress. The fact is that Georgia Groome inhabits Joanne so effortlessly and deeply that it is a sight to behold. Her crying performances wrenches your heart. Other than the perfectlycast Groome the director told us that he applied no seriousness to finding the 'perfect people' for the respective characters the guy in the green jeep for example was cast because he had a green jeep. In this way a gritty unpleasant and plain cast presents itself  an ordinary pack of South London criminals. Better yet they truly emote. When Kelly and Joanne down the sour rum  coke that the older man has given them you can feel the bitter aftertaste of the drink.'London to Brighton' has been likened to Mike Leigh's Naked and perhaps this is an apt comparison. What remains clear however is that Williams has served up a deliciously gritty and unflinching drama in the midst of chaos which he occasionally pauses with wonderful slowmotion captures and dreamy shots of the windy barren boardwalk of Brighton. It's bruised realistic harrowing and compelling  a very good watch.8 out of 10".

I was amazed when I saw it at Edinburgh by just how tough and unflinching a portrayal of the criminal underworld it is. The leads put in tremendous performances that will surprise many and William's writing is exceptional. The film really zips along through its 90min length and pulls the viewer in to a locktight embrace. In my opinion this film is one of the highlights of the year so far and a real find for the British film industry. For a firsttime director working on a tiny budget getting five star reviews in the Guarduan and Scotsman and great praise from the Times is a hell of an achievement.

It doesn't disappoint dark violent gritty and bleak this is what Mike Leigh would be like if he did 18 certificate films with Shane Meadows as his assistant. From the opening sequence of the two main characters bursting battered and bruised into a public toilet it grips like a hand round the throat and only lets up to become uncomfortable it is certainly an assault on the senses and sensibilities of the cinema audience who take this brutal journey along with the characters on screen. Shot on a relatively low budget but managing to not seem so the films main tricks are in the editing jump cuts and flashbacks only adding to the suspense as you begin to piece together the whole sordid story. With some superb acting from the cast especially Joanne who portrays her vulnerability like Toby Kebbell did in 'Dead Mans Shoes' and a suitably dirty soundtrack the whole thing feels very British. It has the grainy look of 'Get Carter' mixed with the grey of any Ken Loach the backdrops of dirty streets and dirtier walls only make scenes like the two polystyrene cups blowing in the wind reminiscent of the carrier bag in 'American Beauty' all the more beautiful. There are of course other nods like a shot that lingers on a doorway for ages instead of showing us what's happening inside which reminded me of a similar shot in Hitchcock's film 'Frenzy'. Although not an easy watch it manages to balance the bloody with the beautiful the violence with the unlikely friendship between the two main female leads and triumphs just as everyone says as one of the best British thrillers of recent years. London to Brighton deserves to be a huge hit its bold its brilliant and its British and it proves once again that we have a thriving film industry packed full of talented people that can still give Hollywood a run for it's money.".

I staggered out feeling relieved it was over but also strangely uplifted and greatly rewarded for my 6.50 investment.

	schema:reviewBody "The plot of London to Brighton is simple the budget minimal the actors and writerdirector unknown. But the result is an unexpectedly captivating movie.London to Brighton follows a prostitute and a young runaway as they flee from their recent past From London to Brighton no less. Through a wellbalanced series of flashbacks we gradually learn how they came to be running. The movie's tension slowly builds as those who are chasing them draw closer. The premise isn't revolutionary but the delivery is robust. Half the characters spend half the time not knowing what is happening around them. Like the best thrillers there is still enough to keep the audience guessing right to the end.The movie is underscored by a very British portrayal of urban mob violence  gritty and selectively brutal with language to match. The characters are explored just enough to give the movie some depth.The issues contained within the movie are morally challenging. While there is little explicit sexual content the mere context will be enough to make some viewers uncomfortable. It would be easy to impose middleclass morality but fortunately that doesn't happen. Instead the characters react only at the extremes The prostitute with misgivings about sex involving very young children not the prostitute with misgivings about prostitution.London to Brighton is notable because it places a 13 year old actor in one of the leading roles. The performance is raw and the look of innocence genuine. Yet she portrays events and emotions that she can have no experience of with disturbing competence. To paraphrase the director she certainly won't be allowed to see the film when it released in the cinema.The movie is rough round the edges. It drags in places. Sometimes the acting doesn't quite convey all the emotions it could do. It is easy to find fault in the detail. But overall London to Brighton is an impressive first feature by 'Paul Andrew Williams' and most of the cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching the first few minutes of London to Brighton you get thrown into the midst of action as dirty and brutal as the reality of a Kings Cross toilet cubicle. What appears to be a mother and her daughter and a tale of domestic violence turns quickly into a strange tale of friendship between an allknowing cheap prostitute and a almost victim of a paedophile crime. As the two friends run for their life travelling on the train from London to Brighton where they think they have a safe house for the day at least they top up their money in the only way they know possible. A disturbing picture of a 12yearold smoking fags like an oldtimer and a fairly realistic portraits of her older friend it shifts from London search action by the baddies and Brighton haven for the girls. The woman playing the prostitute does not glamorise the sex trade nor herself with poor teeth bad hair and the shortest skirt possible paired with trainers on the contrary we get a glimpse of her thoughtful and bitter outtake on life from time to time. She is aware of the ugliness of her task as she carefully grooms the little girl on the way to her first job and there is the theme of innocence lost. We are spared the gruesome details of the actual encounter as actions moves back and forth in time but seeing all this violence against these two women is not easy. This is not a pleasant family movie or a good feel chick flick but nor does it lack any hope or naivety depending on your point of view as we see the bad guys get punished or turned into philosophical saviours. The ending is almost happy with one life restored and two lost. The film ends with a reality check for all those of us who expected a happy ending as live goes on in the streets of Kings Cross as if one life saved was indeed insignificant in the ocean of those with no hope.".

	schema:reviewBody "The quiet in a London toilet is broken at 0307 when a woman and a girl burst into it beaten and crying. The elder Kelly puts young Joanne into one of the cubicles and goes to get train tickets and some food. Not long after they are on a train to Brighton and safety. Meanwhile back in London the cold criminal Stuart Allen makes it painfully clear to small time pimp Derek that he wants Kelly and Joanne brought to him.I heard that this film was very grim stuff and as a result I skipped it in the cinemas although I was helped in this decision by how quickly it came and went in the cinema. Watching it now I have to say that it is a shame that the film did not get more viewers because it an incredibly well delivered thriller set in a world of pimps and gangsters. This aspect could represent a turnoff to many viewers who perhaps have had enough of Lock Stock copycats in the British cinema but rest assured that it is far from being that type of thing. Where some films revel in the gangster clich this film presents it unflinchingly as a cruel world of violence grime and exploitation populated by those with few choices and no hope. This is convincingly delivered and it puts the viewer right into it to the point where I did feel uncomfortable and trapped.The story is simple and what makes it so impressive is how it is delivered rather than just what happens. The strength of the film is in the edit which brings out the story in a flashback structure that works very well. It allows for a strong finish and consistent tension that runs across both timelines of the film equally. What is almost as impressive as the edit are the performances that Williams gets from his cast they are natural and convincing and all the bleaker for it. Stanley is brilliant as someone morally disgusted by her world but equally unable to think of anything else available to her. Groome is just as good and is heartbreaking in the way she moves from a child to an adult between scenes with a confidence that is only on the surface. Harris is suitably morally bankrupt  a real bad man not a criminal with presence and power but the sort of man who would beat you for looking at him. Allen is a harder character because he does have to be a crime lord in this story of small fish but Spruell does pretty well to hold back and be a menacing force driving the story.London to Brighton is not a cheerful film but it is a gripping thriller set in a convincing world of dirt and grubby people. The actors all convince and succeed in making us care for people giving 10 oral sex behind skips in the street but it is the structure and delivery of the story that makes it as good as it is drawing tension simultaneously from both timelines of the same narrative. Grim but well worth it.".

Its the sign of a poor film maker bereft of any ability to utilise cinematic language that he layers every scene with ponderous music instructing us at key moments what to feel.There's no cinema to this it has the look of an episode of the old soap Brookside with a lot of close ups and melodramatic television type acting.The fawning over this film and its director smacks to me of nepotism and the incestuous nature of film festivals. Just because a British film has appeared doesn't mean its any good. We deserve better than this.".

Its the sign of a poor film maker bereft of any ability to utilise cinematic language that he layers every scene with ponderous music instructing us at key moments what to feel.There's no cinema to this it has the look of an episode of the old soap Brookside with a lot of close ups and melodramatic television type acting.The fawning over this film and its director smacks to me of nepotism and the incestuous nature of film festivals. Just because a British film has appeared doesn't mean its any good. We deserve better than this.";

	schema:reviewBody "Overall this was a very good film about exploitation and trouble that revolves around the lives of pimps prostitutes and the homeless when dealing with the sometimes disgusting demands of the paying punters.First of all the positive points brilliant flashbacks were used but not too many times thankfully which didn't confuse but added clarity to the story behind the girl Joanne's predicament. The use of the pimps cut leg and the prostitute Kelly's black eye helped a great deal to let the viewer know that flashbacks were happening although it did seem strange that the pimp was expected to run around on a gammy leg. The major disbelief for me was at the end when the two unarmed pimps were following the armed criminals car. I don't think anyone in their right mind would follow an armed car into an isolated field so that justice can be served let alone pimps who always make enemies by the nature of their job. Also would a punter whose intention it is to torture a virgin 11 year old expect no trouble in his own house with her friend downstairs?? I think all women on the game or about to consider going on the game should watch this film not to scare but to protect themselves against weirdos and such like who know that prostitutes don't usually have mummy and daddy to turn to when a trick turns bad.".

Instead I felt there was a strong element of middleclass voyeurism going on. From the comfort of an arthouse cinema the film invites its audience to partake of a little gutter porn down among the pimps prostitutes and paedophiles of underbelly Britain where violence and sexual abuse are taken to be ubiquitous.The filmmakers do not even see the need to tack on much of a plot to justify their excursion into the sordid. From early on it is abundantly clear where the story is heading and equally obvious that the denouement will not be pleasant.Although the acting throughout is exceptional nothing could change the fact that this was one journey I would rather not have taken and certainly not one I would recommend to anyone else.".

Other characters were equally unfinished. The gangsters looked as if they couldn't blow their way out of a paper bag  full of chip shop bravado but looking persistently out of their depth.One scene is done more professionally than most  when the 11 year old girl makes her entrance to the house of the perv who has paid a lot of dosh for her the white furnishings and Beethoven provide a striking contrast with the kitchen sink filth of most of the movie. A later scene involving a reasonably well executed if foreseeable twist and some shovels adds some emotional ballast and gives the film a sense of momentum. The 13yr old actress Georgia Groome playing 11 year old Joanne puts some effort into her role whereas most of the characters could be friends of the director cajoled into 'acting'.I asked the Director after the Festival screening if he wanted to make any sort of social statement with the film raise social awareness of a terrible issue but he said it would be nice if it did but he doubted it would last five days. There is nothing wrong with just wanting to make a thriller of course and the film is not so bad that many people couldn't enjoy it but when he added that it had taken four days to write and four weeks to shoot one was tempted to add that it shows.".

It makes for an intense experience and there's no rule that says a movie has to be enjoyable this is totally not enjoyable in the usual sense.

Even granted this general dismissal of the value of an admittedly accomplished debut the US online website Metacritic's estimated rating of American reviews of London to Brighton 56 is another erroneous Stateside assessment. English reviews were understandably glowing. American ones were niggardly but not that much.The film explodes into action from the first frame with Kelly Lorraine Stanley and Joanne Georgia Groome bursting into a ladies' room where Kelly hides Joanne in a toilet. They're a thirtysomething whore with bruises and an inflamed black eye and a frightened runaway not yet twelve with melting makeup whom Kelly found at Waterloo Station for her spineless pimp Derek Johnny Harris to please a pedophile gangster named Duncan Allen Alexander Morton. The man came to grief and his coldeyed son Stuart Sam Spruell comes to exact revenge but we find this out later. All we know is these hapless females are in danger and have to get out of London. Kelly leaves Joanne in the toilet while she scores tricks to raise money for train tickets to Brighton. On the trip the pair are pitifully delighted to be in the country a bit of color and Kelly runs down to the beach plays a game to win stuffed toys at the sparsely populated luna park. But Kelly's friends in Brighton are as unsavory as Derek and his pals and don't look much different and a stupid mistake with a mobile phone leads to their discovery.As these simple intensely photographed events unfold flashbacks tell what led up to them. 'London to Brighton' is as well edited as it is acted and the storytelling is seamless and clear. The nastiness is intense but not rubbed in your face. Most of it is sensed but not seen. Stuart Allen cuts Derek's leg in a car with a straight razor when he sends him off to find the girls and Derek limps from then on but we don't see the cutting. His father tied up Joanne and she screamed but we don't see the tying. The writing is economical. Spruell has only a couple of scenes and his father Morton is barely more than glimpsed but their lines aren't easy to forget. Cigarettes are a theme. Everyone is begging them and smoking them and in the climax Stuart tells Joanne how his father stopped him from smoking as a boy by making him eat a pack of cigarettes even the foil wrapping and the filters when he caught him with a lit one. The Coen brothers might envy the grim revenge scene but it's less playful and faster than anything they might do. There's conventional music at certain points to heighten drama and suspense but it's not intrusive and it works. An English rap song at the end credits is grimly articulate and revealing.'London to Brighton' shows huge promise and revives the British gangster genre lifting it out of its slough of cuteness and mannerism. Martin McDonagh might need to have a look.In what seems likely to be very limited release Williams' 'London to Brighton' was shown at Cinema Village in New York from February 8 2008. The way America has overlooked and undervalued this film is nothing short of embarrassing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much praise was heaped upon this film so I watched with some expectation. I've often felt that films with a dark heavy subject matter are automatically given kudos by worthy critics when they don't really deserve it. There were many moments in this film which just didn't ring true. Little things that in a movie dealing with such a horrific subject left me feeling incredulous. The leading Gangster Stuart is stereotypical and not credible  why exactly would he disable the pimp Derek who then has to find the hooker with a heart Kelly and girl Joanne. The way Kelly finds Joanne is not plausible. Kelly has to procure an underage girl so she heads for a train station and hey the first person she sees is an eleven year old girl begging  come off it. Eleven year old girl beggars in London only exist in Dickens and in the mind of this Director. None of the characters in the movie made me feel sympathy even the girl how did they manage that? There are many ways to pick apart this movie but what really depressed me is other peoples' reactions to it in the parlance of the movie they are mug punters.".

I thought the sets were really good  showed the squalor in which these people existed. Characters were a bit twodimensional nice touch showing the relationship between the young girl and the young gangster at the end. The final scenes were not as surprising as might have been thought. Derek was not only nasty but was also stupid. At least the 'tart with the heart' didn't settle down in rural domesticity  back on the mean streets of King Cross?. Not as good as the other recent Britflick I've seen Red Road  now there was brilliant film.".

I've personally never seen a film that is so raw down at heel and realistic almost like the cameraman followed these people around and simply filmed the horrors they go through... no cheese no pretensions simply raw and unflinching in its portrayal. i have no other choice to give this bleak dark sad and enthralling movie 1010... hoping its stock will rise in years to come. definitely not for kids and anybody else easily offended but marvellous entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Films like this make me cheer because it is rare that a film aims so high and hits all of its marks. I mean to compliment not only the writerdirectory Paul Andrew Williams's sureshot storytelling but the outstanding performances all around.This is a deeply unpleasant film by which I mean it deals in dark subject matter. It is difficult to watch. But I cannot remember watching actors work harder to earn their paychecks especially the two protagonists played by the incredible Lorraine Stanley and the young Georgia Groome whose terrified sobbing just absolutely tore me apart.Watching Lorraine Stanley carry both guilt and responsibility especially her scene as she sits listening on the couch I was struck by what exactly how difficult acting must be. I rewound to watch this scene twice amazed with the overwhelming realism of her reaction to what was going on. Neither overblown nor selfconsciously minimalist I could simply not imagine this character reacting any other way not even by a hair. Watching an actor hit their mark so precisely it reminded me of everything I could never pull off myself in front of a camera and why I never sought to be an actor I know that even after years of study and practice I would not be capable of this kind of precision. This actress walks around the whole film with a beat up face and her basic humanity just bores straight through the latex and makeup in a way that never leaves you guessing exactly what's going on in her mind. She's just fantastic.And I don't want to leave out the bad guys. Sometimes they don't get the credit they deserve because we love to hate them but without them you can't pull as hard for the good guys as you would and Johnny Harris in particular pulls off the sleazy evil slightly thick Derek with remarkable effectiveness wearing the characters immorality on his shirtsleeve and fairly stinking up the joint in the best possible way. Ditto for the rest of the baddies for whom you will have I promise no sympathy whatsoever.After watching a terrible bigbudget film with Alist Hollywood types early in the evening I cannot help but focus on the contrast between punching a clock in a big budget film and putting sweat and blood into a labor of love that London to Brighton must have been.There is a vast difference  and it is clear from some of the comments here that many cannot make the distinction  between making a depraved film and making a film about a depraved subject. This film is certainly the latter. At no point in this film are we invited to sympathize with the degenerate villains and our sympathies for Kelly and Joanne simply grow as we become more and more acquainted with the malevolence and motivations of the reprehensible and sometimes demented antagonists.This will be worth your time and I'd definitely rate it higher than the 7.1 it is currently at on IMDb. This is an outstanding film and unpleasant and squicky subject matter aside I recommend it unreservedly.Deft effective filmmaking. This is how it's done folks.".

Take two characters down on their luck and of different ages throw them together via sheer coincidence then add a series of spices in the form of insecure nasty villains with just a taste of a road trip. We watch this film hoping anyone close to us will never experience the day to day life of the characters we meet. We are but onlookers knowing that all that unfolds in front of us will not be terribly savory. But as the story unfolds we grow to like both the key characters because they have been forced into their predicament and while they will be helpless for much of their plight their spirit will hold and eventually ring true. It is nice to be taken for a ride with a script that tells no lies and leaves us with hope. This simple little British tale is a gem. There is a lot to like about this gritty little film.".
