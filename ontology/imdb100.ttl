The events take place in the year 1458 and describe the political turmoil around the election of the new pontiff. Although young Rodrigo Borja plays a prominent role this film is not solely about him but about the conclave of cardinals as a whole. The acting is excellent and it is impressive how a film shot in a few closed rooms without any visual effects or fast action sequences can grasp the attention of the viewer by pure strength of dialog and portrayal of character. I especially liked the acting of Brian Blessed Piccolomini James Faulkner Cardinal Guillaume D'Estouteville Brian Downey Cardinal Juan De Mella Rolf Kanies Cardinal Bessarion and others.The film conveys the atmosphere of these times brilliantly and it is tempting to ask for a continuation. One caveat is that the film is not following the exact sequence of historical events and I would advise reading a wiki article about the conclave of 1458. But only AFTER watching the film.".

Unfortunately that means reading a few of her short stories and waiting six years for her second film. There is no rushing creative genius and there is certainly no obvious goal for capitalistic gains. With her second film it appears she will somehow generate even fewer viewers despite being a festival favorite.The movie is bookended by the narration of PawPaw an injured cat waiting to be adopted by Sophie Miranda July and Jason Hamish Linklater. In the cat's voice we hear the hope of a new life  one that includes love and security. Things aren't quite the same from the perspective of our two heroes.Sophie and Hamish are in many ways a typical couple. They sometimes speak their own language and when things are going good they believe they can conquer all. However hitting a bump means much doubt and and an avalanche of selfdefeatist attitudes. The latest bump is the belief that adopting this cat will suck the freedom right out of their daily lives ... in fact they discuss the fact that because of their age 35 life and dreams are basically over. So with 30 days til adoption they seek to live life to the fullest. You know before it's all over.They both quit the jobs that have evidently been the burden keeping them from greater purpose. Jason works from home as an IT Help Desk agent and Sophie is the absolute worst dance instructor for kids in existence. Jason tries to find meaning by selling trees to save the environment. Sophie decides to make youtube videos  30 Dances in 30 Days but with such mounting pressure ends up under the bed covers before even one video is complete.These two remind me of 8 year olds with advanced vocabularies. Somehow they think society or the universe owes them something and just by dreaming big their lives will be complete. They each believe they have special powers Sophie can move things with her mind not really and Jason can stop time not sure. We see Jason fall under the spell of the most interesting character in the film  an octogenarian played by Joe Putterlik. We see Sophie fall into bed with Marshall David Warshofsky a 50ish single dad living in the suburbs.So here is some of what the film offers us a slacker couple in a rundown apartment same couple overwhelmed by the burden of adopting a cat a crawling security blanket tshirt that stalks its owner a narrating cat an empty affair with a mismatched couple an old man philosopher and his dirtytalk greeting cards a discussion with the moon yes the moon a young girl wonderful Isabella Acres who buries herself in the backyard with the approval of her dad and twice the terrific Peggy Lee song Where or When.Ms. July is a fabulous observer of life and people and personalities. She seems to understand doubt dreams and carries an interest in what time lapse really means for us. Her manner of making these points and sharing her insight is quite offbeat from what we typically see in movies. I believe that makes it more important that she continue to produce her works. Unlike what I will say about her character in this film The Future looks awfully bright for Miranda July.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Future is an excellent surreal cold comedy in the tradition of the great Spike Jonze  Charlie Kaufman films Adaptation Being John Malkovich and the brainblasting Synecdoche NY.Cold comedy is a term I just made up to describe the way they make me feel. They make me laugh but I also feel an uneasy chill up my spine. Maybe it's because the underlying story is somewhat cynical with a chilly brooding philosophy of life. But these films manage to poke fun of this hopeless condition in a way that tickles your funny bone.I preface this review with a warning. As often whoever wrote the DVD packaging is an idiot. This is definitely NOT a whimsical romantic comedy or whatever they advertise. So if you're expecting something cute  fun like When Harry Met Sally you might want to move on. Instead what we get is a very VERY oddball farce centered around a young clueless couple. If you liked 500 Days of Summer which itself is prefaced with the narration This is not a love story then keep reading because you'll probably like this movie too.If you're an animal lover particularly someone who has rescued a dog or cat from the local pound you'll be drawn in instantly. The story begins through the eyes of a stray cat Paw Paw in a shelter nervously waiting to be adopted by the couple before time runs out. The voice of the cat becomes the voice of wisdom throughout the film. I've never seen a film that takes such a thoughtful  innocent approach as through the eyes of a raggedy injured cat waiting at the pound.The first half of the movie is so bizarrely funny with such unique characters living in their private bizarre bubble it feels something like Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventure. But now imagine Bill  Ted if it were directed by French New Wave filmmaker JeanLuc Godard. Starting to get the picture...? In the director's commentary on the DVD writerdirectorstar Miranda July calls this a very still movie. There are long breaks between characters speaking. There is a lot of silence allowing us to soak in the depth of the moment. She jokes about one scene where the leading man dramatically rips off his headphones and she calls it the big action scene the equivalent of a car crash in this movie. Haha.The slow deadpan delivery makes the humor even more pervasive. I laughed out loud several times in the first half. But midway through the movie the mood shifts suddenly and drastically. The remaining half is no longer a comedy but more like a soulsearching philosophical adventure. At first I hated the unexpected change as the title of this review implies because I was really enjoying the oddball comedy.But as the recurring theme of the movie implies the beginning is only temporary. Life changes drastically. Love changes drastically. The plot theme and mood of the film illustrate this perfectly. I can't say much more without ruining the story so just be ready for anything. Ride this crazy rollercoaster to the end.The acting and particularly the casting is flawless. The chemistry between the two leads Sophie Miranda July and Jason Hamish Linklater is so perfect you'd think they're soulmates in real life. Another excellent piece of casting is Joe Putterlik who plays the old man. He is NOT an actor! Miranda found him while answering an ad in the Pennysaver classifieds and she was so taken by his authenticity that she cast him in the role.Another thing I really enjoyed was the great use of symbolism. You have to pay close attention or even see the movie twice like I did to catch most of it. Especially in the 2nd half when things become very poetic and sublime you have to be on your toes.If you like surreal comedy like the films I mentioned earlier films by Spike Jonze Charlie Kaufman Michel Gondry Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Science of Sleep the early Johnny Depp flick Arizona Dream the Paul Giamatti comedy Cold Souls or maybe even the grandfather of modern surreal comedy Catch 22 don't hesitate to see this movie. See them all. Whenever I stumble on a film like this I'm reminded that cinema is a true art form.".

	schema:headline " The Future  the brokenhearted lovers.";
	schema:reviewBody "Controversial The Future is a 2011 film that tells the story of an eccentric couple in their mid 30s who lives in a Los Angeles tiny and bohemian flat. Narrated by PawPaw the injured stray kitten that they have adopted the film tells how Sophie Miranda July and Jason Hamish Linklater's lives change dramatically during the month that they have to wait for taking the cat home. Its initial naivet ends up being blurred by the shadows provoked by the protagonists' decision to break with their daily routine to fight for their own dreams as if they have been told they have only four weeks to live. Soon the adventure is over and in their blind and desperate search of their paths their steps grow more and more away.Heartbreaking absurd surrealistic twee and bizarre at the same time The Future is a piece of independent cinema that cannot be overlooked just because of the presence of disturbing elements such as the talking cat whose highpitched childish voice rumbling in the dark is a powerful beginning by the way. Miranda July director writer and star of the film is not just being weird for the sake of being weird but uses fantastic and bizarre images and situations to talk about our biggest taboos the frailty of love the futility of dreams the anxiety about the passage of time andthe fear of death.With their scruffy curls and their apathetic attitude towards life Sophie and Jason seem to be the perfect couple. By seeing them lied down on the couch with their feet entangled the spectator realizes that they felt really comfortable being together. The image of Jason peacefully sleeping over Sophie's chest sweet for some twee for others is also a very faithful representation of true love as well as Jason's attempt to stop time forever reflects very well how heartbreak feels. Miranda July said in an interview that she intended to describe the bittersweet vertigo of true love. Despite the audience does not doubt in the sincerity and profundity of the feelings of the couple it is forced to see how circumstances and human weakness makes their love begin falling apart. Firstly to understand why they as us ourselves start panicking when the words a 5 years commitment are brought up it is necessary to come back to the kitten wounded in her paw. Like PawPaw who patiently waits for the couple to start his real life she's even counting the days we are always waiting for something good to happen for the real beginning of our lives. And when we reach the thirties we start to question ourselves if that beginning is not already gone get depressed for having wasted the first half of our life and look at the future even more anxiously than before. This is more or less what happens to Sophie and Jason whom the idea of looking after a kitten requiring a total care for the next five years of their lives make them think of their scary future We're 35 now ... by the time the cat dies we'll be 40 ... and 40 might as well be 50 ... and after that spare change. Spare change? Less than a dollar not enough to get anything you want  Jason's words reflect our anxiety about the passage of time as we cannot help feeling frustrated when the years pass by without us having reached the milestones we set for ourselves. Nonetheless in the film July who said of life I rush through it like I'm being chased warns us about the dangers that this feeling of being always late late to live? provokes. The Future not only make us consider how useless is to be always projecting into when it's going to be better but also make us question the importance of our lifetime dreams. It kind of helps us to get rid of the endless frustration caused by the contrast between our high expectations and our daytoday reality. Like Sophie and Jason everyone suffers from the Cervantine conflict that is to say the conflict between the world as we have imagined it and the world as it is. The story of Sophie and Jason somehow questions the futility of dreams often unattainable and absurd remembering Jason's I always thought I'd be a world leader.How is it possible we cannot live happily just because we have not achieved some pretentious generally childish life goals? The Future although has not the answer to the question teaches us to open our eyes to our own limitations and stop feeling as if we deserved something better in life so as to start really enjoying ours. Life is not about waiting things to happen but making things happen as July said in No One Belongs Here More Than You Don't wait to be sure. Move move move July says that she intended to describe the bittersweet vertigo of true love. Here an intense fear vertigo is intimately linked to an intense love as imagining spending a whole life with someone is scary because from the beginning everyone already knows how the story ends one dying in the arms of the other. Hence marriage makes you inevitably realize your own mortality and finiteness. Some optimism is hidden nevertheless behind the pessimistic tone of the film. No matter what happens we always have to remember the enigmatic words of Joe Putterlik played by Joe Putterlik himself an eccentric old man who Miranda met in a street market. This old man who participated in the film shortly before dying tell us with his example that until you are dead never is too late to live. So remember This is just the beginning.Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass it is about learning to dance in the rainAnonymous".

The feeling of both films are very similar and I say that as a compliment it gives Miranda July her own unique voice in film. When I watched the film I regretted having seen the trailer as it gave away a lot of the key points in the story. I think this is a very good film portraying relationships between couples. I could see a lot of symbols in the film pointing at the gender stereotypes everyone is affected by as being part of a patriarchal society. I like the concept of the cat representing the union of the two people and how Miranda shows pets in relation to the other couples in the story to show whether or not their relationship survivedwithstood time. I think this film provokes thoughts and is meant to make people reflect about their relationships with others. It shows that miscommunication fear of confrontation fear of being ourselves is what breaks relationships. He cannot love her if he doesn't love himself. She cannot love him if she doesn't love herself. We can't have decent relationships when we're not being honest with ourselves. Being honest with another person loving the other person comes second to being honest and loving yourself.I don't understand why this film has so many negative comments in the reviews. I truly enjoyed this and hope to see Miranda continue with more projects.".

	schema:headline " Prisoner Of Freedom";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed scripted and starring by Miranda July The Future is a film that has been selected for the Berlin Film Festival in 2011 and the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.The story revolves around a couple that proposes a change in your life. They hate their jobs and the idea of adopting a cat makes it arise a new way of life. However what is proposed as a change eventually becomes routine. The fear of failure and responsibility makes the personality of both becomes complicated and often result surreal. The time is always the reason for the changes. The fear of an uncertain future and nonconformity with the present makes it parodies on numerous occasions the fact of stop the time. Specifically the period in which Sophie and Jason are prepared to adopt a cat is the time when the personality of both becomes strange. There are surreal elements and nonsense conversations that show complex emotional states. The failure in work and routine makes Sophie feel prisoner to her feelings. The figure of Sophie has no splendor. It is a figure off and apparently weak. Her look is sad and never denotes happiness. In the same way the character of Jason is strange. He is the partner of Sophie and lives with her in a small flat and messy. His way of understanding things is similar to Sophie. Both fear the passage of time and want to be free. Marshall's character represents the freedom for Sophie. The way in which both are known is strange and simultaneously comic. Sophie looks out the window screaming and tries to listen to Marshall. The scene reflects a comparison Sophie appears as imprisoned in her own home and as the only escape she has the window that looks out for help. The fact that the cat paw paw has a voice allowed to know their feelings and desires. The image is of an animal that is locked behind bars waiting for a change in his life hoping in this case to be adopted. The comparison is similar to Sophie. Both are locked and desire freedom. The passing of time is also reflected in this character and appear feelings like frustration or even desperation to be adopted.It's a surreal and complex film. The argument at first is easy but when the acts are performed we can see each character's feelings. We can see a lot of nonsense and abstract scenes. Adopting a pet is just an excuse for the change. I would like to highlight the rhetorical conversations about the passing of time old age or the future. Personally I find this film hard to understand. There are many situations that make no sense as the act of talking to the moon giving life to a shirt or the fact stop time. I think film is not made to be enjoyed but it raises very philosophical thoughts on life. The emotional charge of the characters leads to surreal situations and even extravagant. These situations in my opinion have more weight than the argument itself.".

	onyx:emotionText "Directed scripted and starring by Miranda July The Future is a film that has been selected for the Berlin Film Festival in 2011 and the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.The story revolves around a couple that proposes a change in your life. They hate their jobs and the idea of adopting a cat makes it arise a new way of life. However what is proposed as a change eventually becomes routine. The fear of failure and responsibility makes the personality of both becomes complicated and often result surreal. The time is always the reason for the changes. The fear of an uncertain future and nonconformity with the present makes it parodies on numerous occasions the fact of stop the time. Specifically the period in which Sophie and Jason are prepared to adopt a cat is the time when the personality of both becomes strange. There are surreal elements and nonsense conversations that show complex emotional states. The failure in work and routine makes Sophie feel prisoner to her feelings. The figure of Sophie has no splendor. It is a figure off and apparently weak. Her look is sad and never denotes happiness. In the same way the character of Jason is strange. He is the partner of Sophie and lives with her in a small flat and messy. His way of understanding things is similar to Sophie. Both fear the passage of time and want to be free. Marshall's character represents the freedom for Sophie. The way in which both are known is strange and simultaneously comic. Sophie looks out the window screaming and tries to listen to Marshall. The scene reflects a comparison Sophie appears as imprisoned in her own home and as the only escape she has the window that looks out for help. The fact that the cat paw paw has a voice allowed to know their feelings and desires. The image is of an animal that is locked behind bars waiting for a change in his life hoping in this case to be adopted. The comparison is similar to Sophie. Both are locked and desire freedom. The passing of time is also reflected in this character and appear feelings like frustration or even desperation to be adopted.It's a surreal and complex film. The argument at first is easy but when the acts are performed we can see each character's feelings. We can see a lot of nonsense and abstract scenes. Adopting a pet is just an excuse for the change.

Perhaps due in part to my lower expectations. But I thought it was touching and poignant  and very funny the whole theater laughed out loud a few times. I cried at the beginning and I cried sobbed really while having to cover my mouth to mute myself at the end. I really enjoyed July and Hamish Linklater especially Linklater who seemed like a more accessible character while July still bordered on the wideeyed unique indiechick stereotype. Though she did break through that enough moments in the film for me to enjoy her character. The cat monologues that I had cringed at when I read about them prior to seeing the film actually worked quite well for me.I don't think this is a movie I'll rewatch often in The Future but it's definitely one I think people should see at least once or twice.".

It all sounds quite interesting right?Wrong! This movie doesn't deserve to wear the label scifi. There's no science in it and the only fiction is in the horribly bad marketing. So I should blame the distributors for how bad this movie is I guess?Wrong! The blame for this mess really needs to lie with Miranda July. I've never come across her work before and now I guarantee I'll never do so again. Writer Actor Director. She's all those things in this movie and it shows.... Shows that some people should stick to one thing and not try to Doc Savage their life and be fantastic at everything because quite frankly she isn't up to the jobs.The writing is childish because the characters are intensely unlikeable. I suspect that may be the point  to make the audience hate them but making unlikeable characters only accomplishes one thing in any form of storytelling  to alienate the audience. Once you've done that it doesn't matter what the rest of the story is about because the viewer just doesn't care.Her acting is also weak. I understand this was her vision and by donning all these hats she got to make it how she wanted but damn! As far as entertainment goes this wasn't so much of a dropped ball as more of a ball punted into the distance off a cliff! It's pretentious nonsense full of clever symbolism using the cat as a kind of conscience for the characters. However the two characters could never exist in reality because of their inherent flaws. They would never succeed at anything even surviving to adulthood would be beyond them! To call them ineffectual would be liking suggesting that a saucepan made out of chocolate would be fantastic! And like that saucepan the characters would not last long.There's nothing here that fits the traditional role of a movie. I'm beginning to suspect that film isn't a proper medium for such efforts. Whether that will dissuade Ms. July from further stunningly boring efforts to make a point to an audience that mostly just wants to be entertained is anyone's guess. I doubt it.It also galls me that scifi my favourite genre is being saddled by these movies since it allows the writerdirector to apparently throw any crazy sht at the screen and hope it sticks. That isn't what scifi is about!All in all if you are looking for an entertaining movie don't stop here! You'll be disappointed. If on the other hand you are looking to throw away ninety minutes of your existence in an unsatisfying endeavour I would suggest going to the coast and commanding the rising tide to turn back would be more fruitful than watching this film.And now in the interest of balanced reporting...SUMMARY FOR ART LOVERS A wonderful exploration of the neuroses of two desperately unhappy people with commentary by their cat. Woot!SUMMARY FOR NORMAL FILMGOERS Unsatisfying pretentious drivel featuring hateful characters and leading to a frustrating and deeply annoying end. Trim your toe nails instead.".

Just because Miranda is not afraid to ignore all the rules and take her films wherever she feels like taking them does not mean that she is trying too hard does it? A lot of people come out of this movie feeling sad and confused. But I can honestly say there was not a single scene in the movie I felt confused about. There was a lot of extremely creative imagery and conceptual stuff but it was all relative to the PLOT YES THERE WAS A PLOT  LIFE CATCHING UP ON US AND BITING US IN THE BUTT WHEN WE'RE LEAST EXPECTING IT? that's a pretty simple summary that works just fine. I related emotionally to a few scenes specifically especially the one with Hamish Linklater outside by the ocean  I thought it was a perfect metaphorical representation of an emotional phase I cannot discuss otherwise it would be a spoiler!So basically the film has a lot to offer but it's quiet and abstract.

	schema:reviewBody "Any audience member who has seen a previous Miranda July film knows what they are in for if they go to another one. July loves silly and awkward conversations which spring out of thin air and make her characters seem quirky. If you love quirky and oddball then Miranda July is the filmmaker for you. However July is one of those filmmakers who do not have much a gray area when it comes to reactions. Movie goers either love her or cannot stand her.July's latest film is The Future. Sophie July and Jason Hamish Linklater have been in a relationship for four years and live together in Los Angeles. They have steady jobs her as a dance teacher for kids and him in the IT sector. One day this couple makes a huge decision they decide to adopt a cat. Yes for this couple this is a gigantic and tortuous decision. The cat is hurt and in a veterinary hospital so they much wait for one month before than can bring him home. Also the cat has a speaking role. Miranda July supplies its voiceover narration. If you have seen a previous July film this will not surprise you in the least.Sophie and Jason now believe they have one month of freedom left. Once the cat arrives everything will change they will have responsibility they will grow old and then they will die. One month. Therefore they quit their jobs and follow their individual quests not so much for self improvement or to follow their dreams but to follow whatever happens to cross their path. I will stop the synopsis there so as to give away any of the more odd and yes quirky plot turns. I really enjoyed July's last film Me and You and Everyone We Know. It was a pleasant blend of dialogue and original filmmaking. The Future is not quite as enjoyable because now I am waiting for the next awkward and quirky conversation to start. Another overarching and enjoyable element to a July film is a sense of depression and melancholy which the characters have. They are neither steadily happy nor sad but it looks like they feel some sort of weight in their otherness. Sophie and Jason are not like a normal couple. They play silly games like pretending to stop time and agree on a song they would play if one of them lost their entire memory. Sometimes there can be too much quirky and even for what is a simple film July can get a bit too symbolic and the audience might miss a metaphor or three. However some of scenes are quite amusing to watch and this film is a breath of fresh air from superhero extravaganzas and anything you find at the local 34 screen multiplex.".

I'm not sure if i just didn't get the message that was being put across but for me it just didn't work which is disappointing because i am a fan of Miranda July's style usually i really enjoyed her collection of short stories.I mean this movie is going to impress a lot of people i'm sure however i just think its a major step back from the terrific MAYAEWK.

The best July can hope for is that younger viewers will be stumped by the 'enigma' each character represents and then peer pressure will cause them to embrace a movie that isn't there to begin with so they can impress their friends. In the worst case as in mine moviegoers will not be able to suspend disbelief in the pretense of the two main characters and the flow of the film at it's core and will just exhale one super long Napoleon Dynamite sigh until the end of the movie.

Her quirky style reminds me of Lost In Translation. I loved the fact that there was never a dull moment in this. Paw Paw was the weirdest part to me. Still I felt as if he made the movie even more attractive in the synchronism of the characters. The dead pan style of the writer actor and director Julyappealed to me in several ways. The pace slowed me as if I was also being controlled by the wave of a hand. Movies like this takes a special kind of viewer like someone who can tell the difference between Columbian and Jamaican coffee. Writing is almost poetic and ludicrous at the same time. I felt as if Woody Allen was reborn through her. If you like stuff like Being John Malckovich you will love this film. I must admit though that sometimes it seemed as if the writer just merged many concepts into a movie and left it up to us the audience to interpret it. Then again the Beatles did the same thing with music. Hope you like it too.".

Her quirky style reminds me of Lost In Translation. I loved the fact that there was never a dull moment in this. Paw Paw was the weirdest part to me. Still I felt as if he made the movie even more attractive in the synchronism of the characters. The dead pan style of the writer actor and director Julyappealed to me in several ways. The pace slowed me as if I was also being controlled by the wave of a hand. Movies like this takes a special kind of viewer like someone who can tell the difference between Columbian and Jamaican coffee. Writing is almost poetic and ludicrous at the same time. I felt as if Woody Allen was reborn through her. If you like stuff like Being John Malckovich you will love this film. I must admit though that sometimes it seemed as if the writer just merged many concepts into a movie and left it up to us the audience to interpret it. Then again the Beatles did the same thing with music. Hope you like it too.";

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie with my husband and we couldn't stop laughing! It was such a funny take at life in Germany one of the precious few German comedies that actually makes you laugh! The movie is the story of a family's roots about their experience moving from Eastern Turkey to Germany. The movie shows different phases in this family's story from their grandparents' courtship in rural Turkey to the day they become German citizens many years later. The story is full of funny anecdotes regarding new places a new language different food a different culture and how to relate to them. I think any immigrant living in Germany  and not just Turks  can relate to some of the experiences the film shows... On the other hand I saw it in Germany with a very mixed audience and the whole movie theater was roaring in laughter so I think the movie also tickled nonimmigrant Germans' funny bone. Nevertheless as much as I loved this movie I don't know if someone who does not speak German or has not been to Germany would be able to understand the jokes... There is a lot of language humor and many local references so it might not be very universal. I think the previous reviewer certainly did not get the humor...But for someone acquainted with German culture food etc. this movie is fantastic and as I said it is one of those few German comedies which makes you LAUGH!!!".

Good points were the cinematography and the acting wasn't too bad at least from most of the characters. I enjoyed shots from Anatolia and the scenery was nice. However you learn very little about their culture and soon the movie spins around boring dialogs and nonsense. They use a bilingual trick to get you into the perspective of the immigrants who understand no word. However  this idea gets boring fast. Then I could barely sit through long shots of whining artificial laugh scenes and sometimes very bad acting. The script also did not satisfy I could barely make out a leitmotif something about a generation conflict and nostalgia of the older generation.

	schema:headline " Important subject shoddy execution";
	schema:reviewBody "Almanya  Willkommen in Deutschland is a German movie that has lots of German but also Turkish language included. It runs for slightly under 100 minutes and was one of the big winners at the German Film Awards back then. This is a 2011 release so it has its 5th anniversary this year. The writer and director is Yasemin Samdereli and despite what some awards indicate this was not her first full feature film as being in charge of the two jobs I just mentioned. The cast fittingly for the subject includes many Turkish actors and German film buffs will find a handful familiar names in here such as Fahri Yardim Petra SchmidtSchaller Aylin Tezel or Tristan Ptter. But it is really all about the story here and not that much about individual characters performances or storylines. It is about the whole picture and the characters as a unit I guess. This is the story of a man who gets chosen as the one millionth immigrant in Germany and gets the honor of speaking at a public meeting that is broadcast on television with Angela Merkel.So yeah this is a movie about the integration of foreign people and foreign culture as a whole. If you are from Germany you certainly know about the very recent success of the political party AfD and these show that the subject in this movie is still as relevant as it was five years ago if not more. But unlike the German Film Awards I cannot say this film was a success. The only aspect that really convinced me was the music. Otherwise it is a really predictable film that has some tearjerk moments but little about it feels really realistic or authentic. I never had the impression life at its rawest form or a compelling story was told. I also think that there were too many characters in here for its own good and it was virtually impossible to make good storylines around these and elaborate on them properly with that quantity. The consequence was that important storylines about pregnancies and other crucial subjects felt rushed in for the sake of it. I believe the premise here was good but the execution was not satisfying overall. Thumbs down. Not recommended.".

It's a tribute to the first immigrants from Turkey to Germany and the difficulties they faced to adapt and built a life in a foreign environment and culture and how those facts forged the character of the third generation their grandchildren.The story is too familiar i guess to all the people of the southern countries that left them in the 60'ties to seek employment in the industries of the rich North Germany Belgium or even farther to the United States and Australia. At that time the immigrants were needed invited and welcome. One is tempted to compare to the current situation in Europewho cannot support or welcome the todays immigrants anymore.This film could have been easily a heavy one but it avoids that trap. There is no deep analysis of the difficulties and the problems they dealt with there. Instead it has a lighthand tender touch dealing with both joy and sorrow mourning and adaptation. It is as the young boy says at the end of the movie Life is the ups and downs. Music and bright color photography contribute in emphasizing that. Very good direction screenplay and excellent acting from all concerned. The little boy who is the last link in the family chain the one for whom the story is told and who will in his turn retell it to his own descendants is played by a very charismatic child actor that will steal your heart.Another great film from the Turkish film industry.".

Sandrelli herself is outstanding. It's a character that could come off as a clich but she plays her so knowingly and passionately. It's very very easy to fall in love. The film is stuffed full of wonderful '60s pop songs the only ones I recognized were by Millie Small a Jamaican ska artist best known for her hit My Boy Lollipop tremendous clothes and hairdos and that crisp 1960s black and white.

	schema:reviewBody "Ironically titled beautifully shot and wellacted this is a real 'sleeper' from late in the Golden Age of Italian cinema. Stefania Sandrelli perfectly embodies the naive girl from the provinces who wants to be a star. We never know what she can do well apart from be charming and look terrific. But she believes there is a place for her in the firmament of the entertainment industry. Adriana gets to live only on the edge of the life she thinks she wants nice apartment clothes wigs parties making money from sexual favors or modeling. From the start she is taken advantage of by 'agents' or others who claim to be helping her. The numerous men she encounters are mostly ciphers themselves. Their only advantage is that they understand the ruthless nature of their world. Adriana is just their latest victim. One charmer skips out in the early morning from a hotel encounter leaving Adriana stuck with the bill. Another after a sexual episode asks her to call another girl for him. In a brilliantly cringing scene poor Adriana is humiliated in front of friends as her longawaited 'film debut' only serves to use her for comic fodder.The film uses flashback to fill in Adriana's past she was a normal if very pretty girl whose family has already nearly forgotten her. Like many of her kind she craves the love that stardom should bring. As often with serious Italian film the outcome is pessimistic. Director Pietrangeli paces the film well and integrates the brief flashbacks to telling effect. Locations are wellused and often beautifully photographed. The film can occasionally remind a viewer of Robert Bresson's work much faster paced and with a higher energy level but with a similar outlook on youth and the harshness of contemporary life. I'd go as far to say if this film had been directed by Bresson it would be far better known. The international view of Italian cinema at the time was dominated by Fellini Antonioni and a few others while Pietrangeli Monicelli and many fine film makers remain to be rediscovered. Here is a great place to start that re discovery.".

There are shades of la Dolce Vita since every scene takes place in summer and features incredible clothing but our point of view here is radically different it is that of a vulnerable young woman instead of a successful jaded male intellectual like in the Fellini movie. The vita is not so dolce for the girl played by the innocentlooking Stefania Sandrelli who was apparently only 19 when she starred in that film but what maturity she displays as an actress already. A peasant girl from the sticks we meet her right away in Rome where she aspires to glamour stardom fame etc. But because she does not know anyone and is both naive and not very bright to boot she takes many wrong turns and indulges all the wrong people. This film is very entertaining because we are in Rome in 1964 it feels and looks like a hot summer all along and the dresses worn by Sandrelli are unbelievably glamorous. But it is a ferocious social satire and it is tender neither to our silly heroine nor to the sharks who exploit her and many others. The blackwhite photography is gorgeous on the eyes. Nino Manfredi and Ugo Tognazzi do each a memorable turn among the victimexploiters that populates this Roman shark tank. Sandrelli is so good and so beautiful that she manages to make her character attaching in spite of her flaws.".

This film is very entertaining because we are in Rome in 1964 it feels and looks like a hot summer all along and the dresses worn by Sandrelli are unbelievably glamorous. But it is a ferocious social satire and it is tender neither to our silly heroine nor to the sharks who exploit her and many others. The blackwhite photography is gorgeous on the eyes. Nino Manfredi and Ugo Tognazzi do each a memorable turn among the victimexploiters that populates this Roman shark tank. Sandrelli is so good and so beautiful that she manages to make her character attaching in spite of her flaws.";

She takes a leap just when selfawareness finally dawns no one cares for her except Nero's character who she doesn't even notice she's the butt of jokes she really is just a beautiful idiot with no future once the looks fade. Of course the real theme of the movie might be that thinking too much is a bad thing in one telling sequence a jaded writer says as much to her that her brainless liveforthemoment existence might be some kind of unconscious wisdom.

The supporting cast is populated by a few familiar faces including the lovely but terribly underused Senta Berger and Leon Askin known to most people as General Burkhalter on Hogan's Heroes.

	schema:headline " Dubbing? Rudimentary my dear Watson";
	schema:reviewBody "There are several criminal aspects to this subkrimi German coproduction first among them being the fact that the filmmakers neglected to get Christopher Lee and Thorley Walters in to loop their own dialogue. It's somewhat jarring to watch an actor with so readily identifiable a voice as Mr Lee speaking yet the words come out of his mouth spoken by what sounds like a Transatlantic drawl. Or an American dubbing artiste doing a poor Lee imitation.If one can get past this surreal experience however there is fun to be had. Lee and Walters are ideally cast as Holmes and Watson at times certain shots looked like Sidney Paget illustrations come to life. Hans Sohnker does a creditable job projecting a sinister air as Moriarty despite the handicap of dubbing even more atrocious than that of the Englishspeaking cast. He's no Eric Porter or even George Zucco but better than some lesser efforts. The direction however cocredited to the masterly Terence Fisher of many a Hammer classic fame is somewhat workmanlike. Perhaps Fisher's heart wasn'tin it or he was held back by his Teutonic cohort but it's not in the same league as his and Lee's earlier essaying of The Hound of the Baskervilles.The supporting cast are more than adequate with the lovely Senta Berger in an early role adding some class and beauty to a female cast of East End slatterns played by burly hausfraus. It really is a shame though that Lee's icily incisive portrayal of the great detective perfect for the role in every way was only seen in this film and a couple of early '90s productions. Still there's always the consolation of being the only actor so far as i know to have played bot Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes as well as Sir Henry Baskerville. That's got to count for something.By the way i saw this under the title Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace somewhat reminiscent of the Basil Rathbone series the middling entries of which it is on a par. The alternate title of The Valley of Fear is somewhat misleading as apart from characters such as Holmes Watson and Professor Moriarty this film has very little in common with the Conan Doyle novel of the same name. However for a Holmes fan wanting a diverting hour and a half on a rainy afternoon this more than does the trick.".

The storyline wasn't worthy of Conan Doyle and the music score which varies between jazz and pop robbed the film of any atmosphere. And to make matters worse the voices of Christopher Lee and Thorley Walters were dubbed by second rate English actors because the producer didn't want to fly in Lee and Walters from Germany for just one day in order to do the dubbing.

But jazz background music great atmosphere that these black and white pictures have and of course Christopher Lee as world's greatest detective saves a lot. Also Thorley Walters gives a good performance as Dr. Watson. The scenes where Holmes and prof. Moriarty are having an intellectual war between each other's and Homes showing how much the police has not seen on this case are must seen scenes for every Sherlock Holmes fans.Film is directed by Terence Fisher and I think it is even better then he's Hammer film the Hound of the Baskervilles also starring Lee as a romantic hero.

You would not know him when you have seen him as Watson in THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' SMARTER BROTHER The music is brilliant and the atmosphere is very much what a Holmesian fan would be expecting. Unfortunatly the film has a few blunders as well. The most eyecatching would be the Deerstalker and Inverness which Holmes are wearing in the country. They would be most suitable for any comic Holmes where all the other costumes are very adequate I must say. The idea of the police being of the opinion that Holmes has no right to investigate as uttered by Inspector Cooper in the beginning is utter nonsense to anyone who has ever read the cannon. And last but not least  the time! The time warp has already been done in the Universal Series with RathboneBruce and I do not like it there either. But here it is most silly. Watson is said to be driving a car in 1918 where Holes is supposed to be close on sixty! Lee does not look that old does he. Still a very nice and old fashioned Sherlock Holmes movie. 7 out of 10.".

The most major problems are noticeable on the surface already an international coproduction with two directors a lesser interesting plot outline at least in comparison with most of Doyle's stories issues during the postproduction phase and Englishspeaking actors whose voices are dubbed in English! Yup especially if you're a fan of the aforementioned Hammer film or  like myself  swear by the brilliant old Sherlock Holmes movie series starring Basil Rathbone you might consider skipping this one or least lower your expectations drastically. Still S.H. and the Deadly Necklace isn't entirely without merit neither. Surely a lot of fans desperately crave to see the almighty Christopher Lee depict the greatest and most intelligent fictional detective who ever lived? Even though he doesn't sound like himself Lee's charisma and impressive posture is exactly right for the character. With his inborn aura of superiority and stern grimaces Lee is like a natural born Sherlock Holmes and it's regrettable that he was only offered to play the role once and in such lackluster conditions. Lee also receives excellent support from Thorley Walters well cast as Dr. Watson as well as a couple of lesser known performers. The film definitely also benefices from the masterful art direction and enchanting blackandwhite cinematography respectively courtesy of Paul Markwitz and Richard Angst. Last but not least there are some memorable moments to enjoy including Watson's uncomfortable encounter with a prostitute and the multiple disguises of Sherlock Holmes. Sadly these aspects are merely just footnotes in an overall tedious suspensefree and incoherent mysterythriller.".

Terrence Fisher as codirector Christopher Lee as Holmes..his only time as the sleuth which in itself is noteworthy and scribe Curt SiodmakThe Wolf ManI Walked With a Zombieas the scenarist all contribute to SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE DEADLY NECKLACE. While I recognize that others didn't find this movie very good..or found it rather lacklustermediocre I thought it was fun particularly enjoying the psychological duel between Holmes and Moriarty..who at one point attempted to kill Holmes with a mechanism in his cane's handle which fires a blade. This may be the only film with Sherlock Holmes which might figure into the Krimi genre as it is mostly produced by a West German company. One major disappointment was not having Lee's authoritative voice dubbed for his Holmes character which is quite a shame..and a missed opportunity for us who love the idea of seeing Lee as the character portrayed with his voice matching his mannerisms and performance. It would be illadvised for me to leave out a wonderful performance from Thorley Walters a Hammer veteran as the clumsy often naive Watson who must be fed knowledge of Holmes' activities because he's unable to often add 2  2 together on his own. But Watson of course often lends a hand..even playing Holmes' chauffeur when the sleuth goes undercover in disguise to infiltrate Moriarty's home and gang in order to keep the necklace out of the diabolical and dangerous archeologist's handswhen Holmes so needs him in order to combat Moriarty's plot to steal the necklace by any means necessary. It's a delightful game of catnmouse..or it was to me and we are participants. Often Holmes has to use rather illegal methods in order to retrieve the necklace stooping to his enemy's level of theft but it's not officially Mortiarty's property anyway adding intrigue to their battle over such a desired object of great worth. I think Hans Shnker is Lee's equal as Moriarty portraying confidence and arrogance believing he will accomplish his scheme using loathsome criminals to carry his orders out with an ability to manipulate important public figures even The Queen of England..it's mentioned at the beginning when Holmes is scolded by Scotland Yard's lead detective Inspector Cooper played by Hans Nielsen that Moriarty is to be knighted. It was really cool seeing Lee as such a treasured character conveying a believable wisdom always expressing effectively Holmes' abilities to outsmart his adversaries remaining one step ahead of not only Moriarty but Scotland Yard as well.I especially loved one sequence where Holmes attempts to stop a planned assassination by Moriarty outside London where a thief is holding onto the necklace fearful of his safety and happening upon the crime scene of a failed murder attempt where Inspector Cooper must be assisted by the sleuth in discovering all the facts coming across concealed truths only through our beloved detective's guidance. It's a masterfully staged scenario I enjoyed immensely.".

A similar atmosphere for completely different reasons crept into British popular culture only in the 1970s appearing in a British Sherlock Holmes film only in Murder by Decree. But the German film also suffers from the evident fact that the director can't decide whether he wants to make a Sherlock Holmes film or a Sherlock Holmes parody  there are all sorts of misfired jokes and bits poking fun at a Sherlock Holmes superhero image that doesn't really exist  a problem for other directors who have tried spoofing the detective including the great Billy Wilder. The fact is Doyle was careful NOT to make his hero an 'Uebermensch' just a closet Nietzschean  a common romantic British type of the day.Finally all existing prints I know of are in shoddy condition.Worth a view especially for Holmes fans but subpar for this subgenre of mystery film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace is among the twenty something films by Terence Fisher that I have seen one of his less accomplished works. A bit better than the boring Night of the Big Heat this is a production with motivations I don't fully understand for a start I do not know why they decided to make a Sherlock Holmes movie starring Christophe Lee in German although there is an English language version the official version is in German which is the one I opted to watch with Lee's real voice absent in all versions. Then I cannot reason why in 1962 with moneys coming from German French and Italian production companies they decided to shoot an adventure movie in black and white. The decision seems even more uninspired given the uneven quality of Richard Angst's cinematography ranging from attractive expressionistic images as the scene where Holmes saves his life using a police whistle to flat compositions as the Baker Street apartment. Maybe the budget was low but they had several names in the cast that were not highly expensive but neither cheap to hire. And thirdly there is not a welldefined concept of what they wanted to do producers composer writer and director seem to point into different directions. The German producers probably assumed it as one of the many cheap detective movies they were making by the dozen composer Martin Slavin opted for a playful score writer Curt Siodmak kept loyal to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's three main creations Holmes his nemesis Moriarty and his mate Dr. Watson and Fisher well he had to keep everything going. However it would be unfair to deny that there are a few hints that suggest the intention of making some kind of photonovel or a blackinkoncheapwhitepaper comic book and that would explain why the filmmakers could not care less what language characters spoke the anachronisms the more obvious being ladies' hair styles Slavin's jinglingjangling cues extensive use of maquettes and a few disheveled art direction and wardrobe decisions starting with the key prop a very ugly and cheap looking necklace that supposedly once adorned Queen Cleopatra's neck. I am also sure that Lee never wore an uglier costume in his entire long career than the horrendous checkered suit he wears in the countryside sequence. The actor does his best as Doyle's creation obviously not imagining the estrangement that dubbing would produce resulting in an involuntary Brechtian effect of rejection to his participation in the movie so we tend to go for the villains played with gusto by Hans Shnker as Moriarty and Leon Askin as his chauffeurassistant Charles. But what we see is what we get so we better not complain. We are warned very early into the film that we are going to watch a rather sloppy product when the same shot of a longshoreman working on dock is repeated twice within minutes. Compared to this Fisher's next project starring Pat Boone is a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fact that a film is on DVD doesn't guarantee that its quality is very good. The fact that a film's quality is threadbare doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. Although The Deadly Necklace is available separately it's also available on a DVD with a second film. This review applies to both.The plots of these films are of little consequence. They are of interest only to people who collect Holmes films  anybody who merely wants a few of the better offerings would do well to purchase some of those made by Jeremy Brett  or in a pinch Basil Rathbone. There are a few other very good Holmes films featuring good actors on a oneshot basis  such as Seven Per Cent Solution or Private Life of Sherlock Holmes. In any event these films are considerably less estimable.Here we have a pair of films featuring some of the best actors to do Holmes even if the results tend toward disappointing. This appears to be the only disc with these films on it although Deadly Necklace appears by itself in the same version on other discs.Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace dates from 1962 although it neither looks it nor sounds it. Some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produce by Hammer Studios. Not that Hammer hasn't turned out some really schlock stuff but where Christopher Lee was concerned they usually did a better job. The print a direct transfer from a rather worn 11.33 copy in blackand white. The quality of the color suggests the original may have been in color and the snipped ends of the film's aspect suggest it may originally have been 11.66 or more.The film is set in the early 20th Century  not improbable since Holmes was still working then and didn't actually die until 1957. However the script is not adapted from any actual Doyle story. It involves an Egyptian necklace and Professor Moriarty shows up as a worldfamous archaeologist as well as the Prince of Crime. The plot is melodramatic and banal.The biggest defect of this film is that  for whatever unfathomable reason  Hammer filmed it in Germany. It was nonetheless filmed in English. It was then dubbed in German and then redubbed in English. So what you hear isn't Lee nor any of the other original actors but a bunch of unknowns  not that outside of Lee I doubt anyone would know any of the other actors. This is too bad since Lee see his Hound of the Baskervilles makes a quite decent Holmes. As it is his voice double is condescending and plain as bread pudding with no raisins nor cinnamon.The music for this film is primarily jazzy in a possible attempt to be period. Too bad nobody thought of ragtime. As it is the music doesn't relate to what's happening on the screen and often is at odds with the action.The other film is Sherlock Holmes and the Speckled Band from 1931 starring a young Raymond Massey. The quality of the picture and sound is fully up to that of the 1962 effort and in fact a bit better. Massey makes a quite respectable Holmes although he certainly doesn't own the rle in the way Rathbone did and Brett does. The other thespians who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers. The acting  as is true of many films of this period  owes a lot to the postVictorian stage and to silent films.There is very little else to be said of this film. The settings seem to be an odd combination of the 1890s horsedrawn carriages and the 1920s electronic devices such as a primitive dictaphone. Taken altogether it's an interesting curio and a sufficient inducement to buy the DVD with the pairing rather than a DVD with Deadly Necklace only.".

It just could have been much better. The best thing about it is Christopher Lee who is an excellent imposing Holmes. Thorley Walters is equally very good as Watson with signs of bumbling traits but also those of dignity and loyalty. In fact the cast in general make the film watchable. Lovely Senta Berger Leon Askin and suave but menacing Hans Sohnker are the standouts in support. Evidence too of some nice expressionistic images created by the photography suspense especially with Holmes and Moriaty and intelligent dialogue. Unfortunately there is a good deal wrong. The dubbing is atrocious there was absolutely no need for it and sounded cheap and illfitting robbing us of Lee's wonderful distinctive voice. The production design instead of being handsome is pretty flat the editing is choppy at times and Terrence Fisher's direction who did a lot of good to great films and who directed the infinitely superior 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' is only workmanlike at best.Dialogue mostly doesn't flow enough and hurt by the dubbing the costumes are not always that attractive am in agreement with those who found Lee's in the countryside sequence horrendous. Then there is the story which is convoluted to the point of incoherence and too often tediously paced. Overall watchable but disappointing.

	schema:reviewBody "From the onset this film is at a huge disadvantage with viewers like me. Like many foreign films from this era it was dubbed into English for export and lacks subtitles film snobs like me LOVE subtitles. In addition hearing strange voices coming out of some of the characters is jarring. For example Christopher Lee acted as Holmesbut it was NOT his voice in this movie. And folks my age will probably recognize Leon Askin from Hogan's Heroes but not his strange voice! While the quality of the dubbing isn't bad it is regrettable that they didn't use the original actors who spoke English to do their own dubbing.The film is a rather routine Sherlock Holmes story that suffers from the casting. While I love Christopher Lee and looked forward to his interpretation of the character it's really weird that the writer Curt Siodmak never thought much about the 6'5 Lee when he wrote the screenplay. Having him going in disguise and fooling Dr. Watson and his landlady was laughableas a basketball playersized man cannot easily fool anyone!! Yet oddly later in the film Holmes also went in disguise! If they were going to use a disguise perhaps they should have just had him dress up like a tree!! The story is a bit clichd as well since it involved MoriartyHolmes' arch nemesis. However to Holmes fans this is odd as Moriarty is a FREQUENT foil in filmsyet he rarely appeared in the actual Conan Doyle stories and Holmes rarely thought Moriarty was behind a particular crime. However I assumed they used Moriarty simply because the public had come to EXPECT the man due to the many Holmes films.The story involves several disparate crimesmurders that seem to have no connection. One of them however isn't at all hard to figure out and I could easily figure out that the dead man was NOT Blackburnyet the dumb policeman and Watson just assumed it was him. I kept thinking how most people in the theaters must have figured this one out as wellmaking the mystery not at all mysterious.As for the rest of the film it's not bad. It's nothing like the MARVELOUS Jeremy Brett films which are clearly the best but is nearly as good as the Arthur Wontner and Basil Rathbone films. It's reasonably engaging and worth seeing but nothing more.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are so so many Sherlock Holmes movies out there and back in the 1960s there were many of these with German participation as well. That's why the original title of this film is German and so is a big part of the cast and the screenplay writer even if the central character is played by Christopher Lee Scaramanga The Lord of the RingsStar Wars... still alive and more popular than ever 53 years later. He is in his early 90s now. It's a black and whitefilm which is not a given for 1962 and the enemy is again Holmes' arch nemesis Moriarty. Also one of the German actors featured herein is the very young Senta Berger apparently a beauty queen back in the day although I have to say I am not entirely overwhelmed by her looks. The movie is directed by Terence Fisher who also worked with Lee on the Dracula films.unfortunately I have to say I was never too thrilled by the story. No edgeofseat stuff. Lee much better than Cumberbatch is the only one really memorable but all the smaller characters are fairly uninteresting which is also why I was not too shocked by any of the killings. Going against Moriarty in an enemy but still civilized businessmanlike manner is a nice subtle approach and I also liked the music used. Watson however was also fairly forgettable. He did not add really a lot apart from a smart comment here and there and otherwise constant admiring for and drooling over Holmes's genius. Oh and they seemed to love using the word frankly. Frankly my dear reader I don't give a damn about this film. Not recommended.".

Even more bizarrely after she jumps out of the window and Hugh manages to catch her quite miraculously everybody smiles and the triumphant music begins. Wasn't anyone worried about why a young girl should want to jump out of a window??? In case you watched the beginning and switched it off as I regret not having done and you are wondering who was the Malcolm Macdowell character? No explanation is ever given. He pops up every now and then with an intriguing expression on his face.The only redeeming feature of this film is that you can have a laugh at the clever techniques used to prolong the film making it up to an astonishing 1 hour and twenty minutes. For example  lots of pointless slow motion shots with gay music Hugh and the woman make love at least four times and he kisses her breasts on every occasion. what kind of mother has sex with a stranger in a train while her daughter is asleep presumably in the same carriage?

Also onboard this train trip to Hell is Tahnee Welch as a recentlywidowed stage actress her little girl and caretaker plus an internationally known dancer some drag queens and Malcolm McDowell as a toughtalking Stranger. From what I could decipher it appears Grant blames the presence of the Nazis on himself he apparently wrote an unflattering piece about Skinheads but once the train pulls into Venice in time for Carnival! all that business aboard the Express seems to have been forgotten. It would be impossible to credit director Carlo U. Quinterio for his 'unique' vision the filmmaker blatantly copies the crisscrossing style of Nicolas Roeg's thriller Don't Look Now also set in Venice creating an indecipherable scenario wherein the editor was allowed to go berserk with the flashforwards and flashbacks. The movie is so cluttered up with murky minutiae that it allows the straightfaced proceedings some camp value how else to describe the cobbling together of Nazi atrocities and SM imagery with sex scenes involving Grant nibbling on Welch's breastsshown again under the closing credits!. Lowbudget mess resembles those GolanGlobus pictures from the 1980s and poor Grant seems at a complete loss for words. NO STARS from ".

From what I could decipher it appears Grant blames the presence of the Nazis on himself he apparently wrote an unflattering piece about Skinheads but once the train pulls into Venice in time for Carnival! all that business aboard the Express seems to have been forgotten. It would be impossible to credit director Carlo U. Quinterio for his 'unique' vision the filmmaker blatantly copies the crisscrossing style of Nicolas Roeg's thriller Don't Look Now also set in Venice creating an indecipherable scenario wherein the editor was allowed to go berserk with the flashforwards and flashbacks. The movie is so cluttered up with murky minutiae that it allows the straightfaced proceedings some camp value how else to describe the cobbling together of Nazi atrocities and SM imagery with sex scenes involving Grant nibbling on Welch's breastsshown again under the closing credits!. Lowbudget mess resembles those GolanGlobus pictures from the 1980s and poor Grant seems at a complete loss for words. NO STARS from ";

Night Train to Venice literally has to be seen to be believed. The socalled plot sees Hugh Grant who should be thoroughly ashamed of himself for agreeing to appear in this drivel no matter how much he needed the money boarding the Orient Express to Venice to take a manuscript he has written exposing a neoNazi movement to a publishing house. However he is being followed by a group of badlydubbed Nazis who are as camp as Christmas and about as terrifying as tinsel.Speaking of Christmas Grant's laughable dialogue where he states that he hopes to receive books rather than socks next year because I'm an intellectual is one of the few hilarious high points though for all the wrong reasons and leads to the first of the film's many softcore sex scenes interpolated with the sight of a transvestite miming to Edith Piaf. This is just one of many examples of just how random and bizarre this film is it's as if no one involved put any effort into making it coherent. Questions are asked but are never answered and if you are hoping for an ending where the whole thing comes together and makes sense then think again you'll be left scratching your head long after the sight of Hugh Grant having sex for the umpteenth time has disappeared from the screen and not because the film is complex or in any way clever it just seems to have been thrown together without any of the filmmakers caring about plot or substance. What exactly is the point of having Malcolm MacDowell grimace at the screen in slow motion in every scene? Why are so many scenes interrupted by shots of the train going past as if we hadn't worked out yet that the film is set on a train? The actual script can only have been about seven pages long and the director has cruelly padded it out with naff slowmotion and totally unnecessary establishing shots. If you watch this film prepare yourself for some unintended by the 'filmamkers' laughs but most of all to be baffled and bored by this unbelievably awful movie.".

I will defend this movie's right to that title until my death as I can not envisage a worse film being made in the future. Some films are so bad they're actually quite fun to watch becoming cult hits in the fashion of 'Springtime for Hitler' from Mel Brooks' 'The Producers'. Yet N.T.T.V. opens up a whole new category below that... a category in which making it through to the end of the film is a physical challenge of the highest proportions. The complete lack of direction that permeates every facet of this film's production leaves an almost tangibly bad smell in the room in which one attempts to suffer through the experience. I think its supposed to be a surreal paranoid fantasy with a few neoNazis thrown in for good measure done in what was presumably conceived as an European 'arthouse' style  'Murder on the Orient Express' meets 'The Boys from Brazil' and is then drained of all quality and coherence. Anyway I bought the DVD and it's sitting in its wrapping on a shelf in my house ready to be produced if I ever have to prove in the future that this is without doubt the worst film ever made.".

This is where I begain to get fuzzy.  McDowel talks to Grant alone and tells him that he knows his thoughts and fears...And from their it turns into a story about memories a drag queen NeoNazi's memoryloss fear and ultimately dreams.

I'm guessing their master copy was a print prepared for television. The faded colours specks and scratches suggest it was done many years ago. While part one appears to be intact  I'm not sure  part two is obviously edited with clumsy jump cuts where violence has been trimmed. Judging from the widescreen trailer  included on the DVD  an entire scene was removed where a servant becomes an unwilling participant in an orgy. The DVD distributor Universum Film is usually meticulous with its releases. Presumably the negative for 'Kampf um Rom' is lost and there were no usable interpositives or even theatrical prints. Given this major problem I'm surprised they went ahead with the release. Under the circumstances the lack of an English option  either soundtrack or subtitles  hardly matters.".

When they do in small ways the screen lights up and you keep thinking yes yes at last. You understand how hard it is to find true companionship and even when you do it doesn't work out quite right. Still they both offer cracks in each other's worlds and we get sucked in for the joy of it and the eventual disappointment.A surprising film very moving and yet quietly so.

	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere in Yugoslavia RuzaMirjana Karajovich left behind a man who didn't follow her younger self to Germany. Presumably this is the man we see cutting branches off some denuded trees in the opening moments of Das Fraulein a film that conveys the same American celluloidal myth that women can't have it all. When the man's pruning shears cuts through one more indistinguishable branchsymbolic of women like Ruza who left their homeland the screen abruptly goes black and the first image we see after that severing is an overhead shot of Ruza in bed no longer a fraulein but a spinster childless to boot. Not satisfied with being a mere branch on some treea patriarchal metaphor Ruza came to Germany learned a new language learned anew period. But the modestly successful restuaranteer is not happy far from it. That's the price a woman has to pay for choosing a career over family. Quite literally the filmmaker shows that Ruza made her bed and now she must lie in it. The visage of this middleaged woman tells the whole story there is no love story only her canteen and the endless counting of money. Without variation Ruza gets up every morning takes the graffitifilled elevator in her apartment complex and walks to work in an industrial landscape dotted by warehouses and train tracks. Like clockwork MilaLjubica Jovic her cloyingly pleasant underling waits for Ruza to unlock the front door. In her office the only photograph we see is a lonely photograph of a younger Ruza posing with the restaurant facade at the opening. This is what she sacrificed a husband and children for. Ruza has been married to this canteen for twentyfive years. Her unsmiling face indicates that it's time for a divorce.Meanwhile a new has just arrived in town a drifter from wartorn Sarajevo a Bosnian. AnaMarija Skaricic survived the war but will she survive leukaemia? After spending a night with friends Ana wanders into Ruza's canteen and gets hired as a waitress. How long will it take for Ana to take over the canteen and inject a shot of joie de vivre into its zombielike visitors especially Ruza who sees her former fraulein self in the new girl. Not long. At seventyfive minutes the short running time mirror's Ana's sense of urgency to make every minute count. In one sequence contrary to her coworker's presumptions about their boss Ruza has no objections to her birthday being celebrated. Ana's gambit pays off. As the older fraulein dances the filmmaker uses exaggerated light to document the exact moment of Ruza's rejuvenation as her hair flies around in the heightened shining that takes years off the restauranteer's leathery skin. Light is used to signify youth as in another scene where Ruza and Ana run like schoolgirls through a downpour the light catching the trajectory of the raindrops and the bounce of the women's hair. But Ana's own light is wavering exemplified by the strobe light of the night clubs which Ruza's charge frequents. The intermittent dark the microsecond pauses between the electric breathing is where Ana's destiny lies. But before the darkness shines permanently out of Ana's diseased body she teaches Ruza how to let people into her life again. While Das Fraulein can be overly schematic there's enough emotional truth between both frauleins that outweigh the clich of the unmarried and childless woman who fixates on the younger woman as a daughter figure. Ana's surprisingly guarded side prevents the film from devolving into easy sentimentality. To the viewer's surprise Ana has an emotional stuntedness which prevents her from getting close to people. Whereas Ruza was looking for somebody to love Ana has an insularity about her that won't allow the child of war to love back.".

	schema:reviewBody "Das Frulein or Fraulein is a SwissGerman coproduction from 2006 so this one had its 10th anniversary last year already. It is the most known work by director Andrea Staka and she is also one of the several writers in here. The film received a pretty solid deal of awards recognition and it is a relatively brief film at only roughly 75 minutes. This is also a positive factor actually because the film dragged on more than just a few occasions and I never managed to develop any interest in the female protagonist played by Mirjana Karanovic or any of the supporting players. One reason may be that I do not really know any of the actors in here another would be that I have never been to Switzerland and it is more of a Swiss than a German film for sure. But there are also Eastern European components to this one but this already becomes visible pretty quickly if you read the actress' names.As for the film itself it is certainly more on the bleak and realistic side than just for pure entertainment purposes. This is on the one hand good but on the other hand also a disadvantage as they need to elaborate more properly in terms of character studies and plot developments and this is quite a challenge. i would say it is a challenge that the filmmaker here unfortunately did not succeed with as I not only did not develop any interest in the central characters but also as after seeing the film I cannot really come up with one definite reason why you should check this one out why this was a convincing watch. So I certainly do not agree at all with all the awards the movie won and as I see Staka is still making films these days it seems I hope she managed to step her game up in the last game. This one here gets a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

Fact is that Swiss movies are almost unknown in the US. In Switzerland even many filmmakers are convinced that the topics are mostly too Swissspecific and that great Swiss actors do not exist. So far for the present. For the past Switzerland's greatest filmmaker Kurt Frh 191579 is nowadays highly criticized for the alleged lack of disclosing the miserable social situation in the 50ies and 60ies and for having strongly used Italian NeoRealist movies in order to make his own films. I assure you both is not true. But nevertheless not a single one of many hundreds of Swiss movies made between the silent time and den 70ies are available on international DVDs.Social topics have a long tradition in Swiss film. I just remember Kurt Frh's Bckerei Zrrer where the conflicts between the early Italian immigrants and the indigenous population in Zrich are focused or later especially in the movies of Kurt Gloor 19421998 f.ex. Die Pltzliche Einsamkeit Des Konrad Steiner. Not to forget the movies of Alain Tanner although his movies are all in French and thus form a minority in the rest of Switzerland. Also the present movie deals with immigrants has a strong social vein but unlike Frh's and Gloor's movie you hardly hear Swiss German spoken. The three main actresses  famous artists imported from ExYugoslawia as if there would not be enough talented Yugoslawian women familiar with the jobs shown in the movie  speak broken High German. From the rest of the cast only the two men  Andrea Zogg and the Spaniard Pablo Aguilar  are to be mentioned Zogg is to see about four or five times for possibly 10 minutes Aguilar for totally perhaps 2 minutes and the rest of the crew for fragments of seconds. So an interaction between the Yugoslawian immigrants and the Swiss population is out of the question and the movie is showing nothing else than how the three women get along partly speaking SerbianCroatian and partly broken German. In this movie there is no trace of the wit the humor the tearscausing miseries and the whole empathy of Kurt Frh's movies but nothing either of the socialist problems brought up in Kurt Gloor's films. This movie was produced in Switzerland that is all. It could play anywhere in Europe there is nothing Swissspecific in this movie except perhaps the five seconds when your hear Zurich's Radio 24.Let me tell you one thing As long as Kurt Frh's and Kurt Gloor's movies are not subtitled engraved in international DVDs and available around the world such mediocre and questionable films like Das Frulein have no right to go around the world.".

At times I felt it was just made for the sake of making. The film's music is also not particularly good which is a great disappointment since I've always liked Nadeem Shravan's compositions regardless of how much I enjoyed a film. The title song is nice though. The film stars Aishwarya Rai in the leading role of Tia. She is beautiful that's something that has been said a million times already but it's not enough to carry the film especially considering that her acting is not very impressive in this film and she is just okay. See movies like Devdas and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam to understand how the combination of her beauty and acting makes wonders. Arjun Rampal is also okay though in his favour it can be said that he tried his best. Talents like Isha Koppikar and Paresh Rawal are once again wasted and sadly so.

Boy meets girl boy falls in love with girl but girl is in love with another man. Then boy gets depressed and girl marries the other man until tragic happens. Yup. That sums it up in 2 hours of a movie. I like romantic movies but this one i can just pass and call it a day. Performance wise Aishwarya Rai was good but she really needs to stop crying at everything. Arjun Rampal was okay. I honestly wished someone else can fill in for Priyanshu Chaterjee but then again who would wanna be wasted? Paresh Rawal and Rakhee Gulzar were amazing. I wish i could see more Rakhee in newer films. The saving grace of the movie was the music. I don't know why you guys hate the music? The music was excellent. All the songs were great. NadeemShravan never disappoints with music though i wish they could make more. Nowadays Bollywood music sucks. I wish the old days were back. And that's why i rated the movie with 7 mostly because of the music".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally a film that will have you gripped to your seat till the end and yet which is neither melodramatic nor manipulative. Great cinematography and music and of course the cast let alone a tight plot make this film a mustsee. From the always reborn love triangle the story develops with the right timing faster than your average French film and yet without anything of the Hollywood clichs that usually ruin everything. Signoret is lovable as the handicapped wife who nevertheless seems to always know everything. dbdumonteil on IMDb is right on track about the depersonalisation thus adding another layer of interpretation to an already engrossing flick. I agree with Olof reviewer on Amazon that Alain Corneau didn't exploit Stefania Sandrelli's scene stealing abilities thou.I am still wondering why Inspector Mnard does... what he does can't say more but my only hunch is that violence redeems sins.

	onyx:emotionText "Finally a film that will have you gripped to your seat till the end and yet which is neither melodramatic nor manipulative. Great cinematography and music and of course the cast let alone a tight plot make this film a mustsee. From the always reborn love triangle the story develops with the right timing faster than your average French film and yet without anything of the Hollywood clichs that usually ruin everything. Signoret is lovable as the handicapped wife who nevertheless seems to always know everything. dbdumonteil on IMDb is right on track about the depersonalisation thus adding another layer of interpretation to an already engrossing flick. I agree with Olof reviewer on Amazon that Alain Corneau didn't exploit Stefania Sandrelli's scene stealing abilities thou.I am still wondering why Inspector Mnard does... what he does can't say more but my only hunch is that violence redeems sins. I am open to hearing from other reviewers as I can't make up my mind about his change of attitude.

This is not a straightforward thriller. Instead it twists and turns with lightening speed. Montand is exceptional in what seems like a nowin predicament. The supporting cast is first rate. Sandrelli and Franois Prier as Montand's unseemly boss are great and Simone Signoret is Prier's infirm but shrewd wife. Corneau's direction is dynamite. The cinematography is by tienne Becker and the suitably dramatic music is by Georges Delerue.".

	schema:headline " More intriguing than a whodunit even when you already know who's the murderer";
	schema:reviewBody "A whodunit's success often rests on an unexpected but believable twist. A thriller in which the audience already knows the culprit is however more difficult to make because with no riddle for the audience to solve the moviemakers have to work doubly hard to hold their interest. Police Python 357 is most intriguing because even though the audience knows everything the various characters in the movie have different levels of knowledge of the truth.At the lowest level is Menard Mathieu Carriere the young policeman who knows little about the murder he is investigating. Higher up is his partner Ferrott Yves Montand who is in a most unenviable position and knows that when various clues are followed he will get closer and closer to being implicated as the prime suspect for the murder of his girlfriend. He therefore takes every step to foil Menard's chances of exposing him. He however does not know that his boss Ganny Francois Perier the policy chief is the real murderer and also his murdered girlfriend's other lover. Ganny knows all not initially but eventually and plots to get out of this mess before his imminent retirement by framing Ferrott. Above these three levels of knowledge is Ganny's wheelchaired wife Simone Signoret who not only knows everything but also has the calm detachment that Ganny does not have.It is watching these three levels of knowledge interplay that makes this movie so absorbing. There are a couple of scenes that remind you of Hitchcock such as Ferrott following in a car at a distance his girlfriend on foot. Those who happen to like westerns will love Montand's one fast draw once is enough more will ruin it. It beats the best you've seen in real westerns such as Ladd Shane Newman Lefthanded Gun and Brando Oneeyed Jack. Then when you think that you can see a couple of alternative endings for the movie it surprises you again.Interesting to note that while real life husband and wife Montand and Signoret whose names appear first and second respectively in the opening credits have only one scene together close to the end.".

But it is Montand's wife Simone Signoret who is the real intellectual rival and her reaction after her husband confesses to the murder of his lover is remarkably telling but human. So we have a wrongfully accused Montand being framed by his superior for the murder of the lover they unknowingly shared  while Montand's reallife wife Signoret plays the wife of the rival engineering his demise.But it is a solid third of the way into the film before any killing occurs and it is the attention to pace character and setting that establishes this as more than a typical genre entry. The odd locations were Corneau's hometown so we get a nice mix of old homes and gorgeous canals but also modern office buildings  and a pedestrian grocery store featured to excellent contrasting effect.

	schema:headline " Emma Schweiger makes this movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Kokowh a wordplay on Coq au Vin is a German over2hour movie from over four years ago. It was written and directed by possibly Germany's most famous right now Til Schweiger and he also plays the main character funnily also a script writer. In terms of money only the newest Pirates and Potter films were bigger hits at the box office in Germany in 2011.The movie starts with a little Ulrich Wickert cameo and we see how the protagonist is quite a Casanova with quickly changing girlfriends. All this changes a bit when Jasmin Gerat's character comes back into his life professionally and he finds out he has an 8yearold daughter from a onenight stand. These two change his life completely and I have to say Emma Schweiger obviously Til's real daughter as well the fourth movie of the two together really rocked this movie. Very authentic great screen presence funny line delivery and just a joy to watch in general. She is probably the most talented of the Schweiger kids and appeared most recently in another as the lead character in Honig im Kopf. I'm not sure how Natalie Imbruglia's Torn fits the scene where the two meet for the first time but it's a good song so I am fine with it. This film has decent music choices all in all. Aside from that Katharina Thalbach was lots of fun at the dentist's. It's another example how Schweiger casts usually very famous actors even for insignificant roles. However there are films where this is more the case than here. Just like in other Schweiger movies the film's title is a childlanguage quote picked from a scene Keinohrhasen Honig im Kopf out of the movie which somehow bears lots of significance. I cannot really say this is the case here but you could probably make an argument that he still has to get used to being a father now and making a kid Coq au Vin instead of chips or spaghetti is a metaphor for this struggle. Another favorite scene of mine was the mobile phone  toaster scene. Pretty funny and the little Schweiger girl has such great face acting at age 8 probably more than the likes of Neubauer Thomalla and Ferres at 50.Jasmin Gerat plays the love interest here and sadly I have to say she has neither the range nor the charm of Nora Tschirner and with her short hair she does not have the looks either. The worst is maybe that one scene where she uses that foreign accent. Downright cringeworthy. Maybe they should have gone with Friederike Kempter as the female central character. Also she has always some kind of unpredictability with her characters that could have helped a movie where we basically roughly know they will become a couple in the end and he will become a good daddy. One unpredictable thing was the constant story inclusion of Finzi's character who I initially expected to disappear as quickly as he entered the picture. Anyway I personally enjoyed the first hour more than the second as it included more scenes with Emma Schweiger the youngest of four Schweiger children and the second half was more about the adults taking about the situation and the first half was really more about Til Schweiger's character starting to get to know and bond with his daughter If you enjoyed this take a look at the sequel from 2013 which is also over 2 hours long. I read about plans for a third movie but Schweiger kept it at 2 as well for Keinohrhasen and Mnnerherzen so it's probably not gonna happen. I also read that Bradley Cooper may star in an American remake. We will see how much truth there is to that. Until then you have to watch this film. Here and there it is a bit cheesy in terms of dialogs the worst example begins to love her realizes he made an infinite amount of errors but all in all it is a decent watch thanks to Little Miss Schweiger. Without her it would have been a fairly forgettable romantic comedy with dramatic elements. Recommended.".

	schema:headline " Excellent script with superb actors and an amazingly suspenseful ending. Catch before US remake.";
	schema:reviewBody "I would recommend not reading how IMDb bills the movie I won't say why other than if you don't and you see this movie it will be a richer experience for it. Basically though the movie is about the capture of serial killer Gabriel Engel played by Andr Hennicke someone the Police have been trying to catch for a very long time. A small town cop Michael Martens played by Wotan Wilke Mhring comes to interrogate him over the disappearance of a child from his village and makes more headway than the Detectives have. However the meeting troubles Martens and the two characters suddenly seem not as far apart as their roles suggest.The opening of the movie grabs you by the throat. It portrays Engel the killer being tracked to his apartment and captured by the Police but not without a battle first. It's dark violent and extremely exciting cinema at this point and it shows you immediately the intelligence cold calculation and sheer determination of the serial killer. It sets the movie perfectly and tells you a lot about Engel. It's superbly shot and visualised and had a fair amount of the cinema on the edge of their seats with audible excitement from the people next to me.I have to then mention what happens after this scene the titles. It struck me just how good these looked and I became fascinated with them. The words appear on the background and begin to move slowly across the screen. As they do so any foreground object that appears or walks across them does so over the top and the title moves behind them. For some reason this simple effect was highly engaging and coupled with the unique angles and gentle scenes that played out I was totally enthralled.The good camera work follows on from the initial scenes there are some unusual angles and shots used but they are never obtrusive. The camera is secondary and you do feel yourself pulled into the film by the strength of the story and characters not noticing the camera moving for you.Hennicke as the serial killer steals the show. He is utterly enthralling when he is on screen and carries the role with complete believability and passion I do mean that as a compliment. There is no real appeal for this character yet he has a fascination kind of like the scene of an accident where everyone slows down to look.Mhring is equally as strong and he is engaging because you identify so much with him and want him to win through. The chemistry between the two actors during their interview scenes is excellent the power and strength of the killer against the insecurity and uncertainty of the cop are played out very well. These scenes provide for some great moments with some excellently written dialogue between them both. His slow descent and the way he is affected by the killers words is expertly handled. The way his life and his personality is slowly changed one step at a time is very strongly written.The relationships between the cop and his wife and fatherinlaw are positioned early on in the movie and incredibly naturally this is something I really liked about this movie there's no exposition that is glaringly obvious and even when it is made to the audience it's not always made in black and white you have some assumptions to make. I really liked that it means you have to do some of your own thinking rather than be spoon fed.Another interesting triangle of relationships is that between the two cops and the killer all have different personalities at the beginning of the movie but as it progresses Martens grows closer to them both. Again well written and visualised characters with strong and believable dialogue.The movie looks at the effect of strong faith and belief on a person and the family unit. The lead begins as a staunch religious believer and good all round character and it's later in the film where his faith and belief are eroded and the doubt enters his mind. During the QA after the movie Christian Alvart the Writer and Director said that the role of the killer is that of the doubting voice of total doubt. The idea being that the two characters are the extremes and it's from these extremes at either end of the spectrum that people can leap to becoming a fanatic. A fanatic as in the killer or a religious fanatic. It's this that he wanted to show in the movie. It's only when the reconcile the extremes that they become a person and not a fanatical creature.There are some shades of comparison with The Silence of the Lambs and the superior Manhunter but these are inevitable considering the interviewing of a serial killer. There's also comparison with another movie that people will make and I shan't tell you which this is something Alvart himself acknowledges but didn't realise until after he had filmed it. There's no negative aspect to this and the connections are quite superficial the power and strength of this movie are in the many other layers not the top glossy layer but deeper in the characters family life and fanaticism.The ending is extremely well crafted if not entirely well hidden. It's strong suspenseful and the closing fifteen or so minutes are probably the most suspenseful and exciting I've watched in a long long time the audience gasped during these last moments. I thoroughly recommend this movie especially before the deal is made for a US remake and it will be Alvart said as much during the QA. So see it now it's a superb movie with some excellent performances and a very strong script. This was undoubtedly the best movie of the Edinburgh Film Festival 2005 for me.".

	schema:headline " Topnotch psychological horror from Germany.";
	schema:reviewBody "Antikrper is a tremendously entertaining gripping and chilling serial killer movie directed by relative newcomer Christian Alvart. From the superb edgeoftheseat introduction and the inventive use of credits the film is imaginative brave and unpredictable.While there are shades of Silence of the Lambs in this film interestingly there's even a throwaway comment about Hannibal Lecter as if the director was aware of the similarities in storyline and decided to confront this matter headon Antikrper is a much more realistic characterdriven piece. Andr Hennicke is genuinely frightening as the paedophile serial killer Engel who embarks on psychological mind games with the likable countrybased policeman Wotan Wilke Mhring. Mhring's portrayal of a man who is driven to the edge of his wits is brilliant stuff and riveting viewing.The film is undoubtedly a rollercoaster ride of emotions. There are some uncomfortable scenes Engel makes Lecter look like Father Christmas in comparison but they rely on the viewer's imagination rather than inyourface gore. There are also some brief but realistic sex scenes that drive the plot along rather than serve as mere titillation. The film's strength is in its intelligence. This is not your average serial killer movie by a long way. It raises interesting moral questions such as Just how good is a 'good man?' I was surprised to see Norman Reedus appear in a small role in this film. Why Reedus was brought in for such a small part is puzzling but it was good to see this distinctive American actor nonetheless.A highly recommended movie and one I'm glad to have stumbled across by accident. This is one of those film you may never have heard of but which you'll be very glad you watched.".

From the superb edgeoftheseat introduction and the inventive use of credits the film is imaginative brave and unpredictable.While there are shades of Silence of the Lambs in this film interestingly there's even a throwaway comment about Hannibal Lecter as if the director was aware of the similarities in storyline and decided to confront this matter headon Antikrper is a much more realistic characterdriven piece. Andr Hennicke is genuinely frightening as the paedophile serial killer Engel who embarks on psychological mind games with the likable countrybased policeman Wotan Wilke Mhring. Mhring's portrayal of a man who is driven to the edge of his wits is brilliant stuff and riveting viewing.The film is undoubtedly a rollercoaster ride of emotions. There are some uncomfortable scenes Engel makes Lecter look like Father Christmas in comparison but they rely on the viewer's imagination rather than inyourface gore. There are also some brief but realistic sex scenes that drive the plot along rather than serve as mere titillation. The film's strength is in its intelligence. This is not your average serial killer movie by a long way. It raises interesting moral questions such as Just how good is a 'good man?' I was surprised to see Norman Reedus appear in a small role in this film. Why Reedus was brought in for such a small part is puzzling but it was good to see this distinctive American actor nonetheless.A highly recommended movie and one I'm glad to have stumbled across by accident. This is one of those film you may never have heard of but which you'll be very glad you watched.";

He says that since he is locked up the whole time the audience can be sure that there will be no more murders and so most of the movie is talking and trying to create closure. The movie is very much a focus on the minds of normal people versus what happens to the make a normal person turn into a serial killer. Alvart did a lot of research for the movie on serial killers Catholocism spending months working in a church and being a father there is a lot on parentchild relationships. There are so many levels that are covered in this movie and that is why it is so engrossing and watchable. It is a totally intellectual film that makes you think about social issues as well as completely scaring and creeping you out. The ending was so amazing. It is the best thriller I have ever seen and no one would ever think that Alvart was the most skeptical of this script ever being produced.Alvart said this film is the most personal out of the many scripts he proposed to producers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Only the second film by the former editor of the legendary German movie fanzine XTRO Antibodies aka Antikrper is an assured and suspenseful work which while it willingly acknowledges its obvious indebtedness to Hollywood models still manages to strikes out convincingly on its own. The most obvious inspiration behind Christian Alvart's film is The Silence Of The Lambs 1991 to which explicit and grimly affectionate allusion What did you expect? Hannibal Lecter? is made by killer Gabriel Engel Andr Hennicke at one point early on during his captivity. Restrained in conditions which recall those featuring in Jonathan Demme's movie visited too by a similarly awed and repelled police investigator Engel actually gives a performance less selfconscious than the muchimitated Anthony Hopkins'. And because of the latitude of German cinema where the precise detailing of paedophilic lust rape is more permissible as a drama demands it is all the more disturbing in the telling. Watching this film where the principal and community are wracked equally with guilt and blame one easily recalls that this is the national cinema which earlier produced another monstrous child murderer that of Fritz Lang's M and indeed is a country where communal guilt is never very far below the surface.Just as Clarice Starling needs her Lecter so Schmizt needs his Engel to help solve a case. Having already killed 14 most of whom were young boys Engel offers his own tantalising clues and hints as to where the other killer may be found. But as he says Evil... is infectious and soon Schmizt begins to question his own moral certainties before ultimately basing his judgement on the only firm foundation he knows  the Old Testament a process which involves a particularly painful scene of self mutilation by way of penance as well as providing doctrinal justification for the suspenseful final scenes.Antibodies is a film which never slackens its tension and which avoids completely the flabby sentimentalising or overcooked heroics which often mars the American thriller product. Silence Of The Lambs contained more certainties than we are provided with here. Even though it gave its audience an extreme form of serial killer in the form of 'Buffalo Bill' one both flamboyant and rock inspired it instantly made a stereotype of itself and it was this 'respect' of sorts by the audience that the director has said he was keen to avoid. Like Silence Of The Lambs Se7en and the rest of their bloodline Antibodies parades a notable killer's lair of its own as well although any artefacts on show are less disturbing than the ultimate meaning of the 14 red squares drawn by Engel on the wall or the spare clean white tiles of his torture room.At the centre of such films is inevitably a duel between killer and cop and here the two main parts receive terrific performances Hennicke mightily disturbing as the gloating and manipulative serial killer writing his books of blood and Reedus drawn and haunted as the cop on the edge. As is often the case in this sort of film a troubled parallel is drawn between them a process highlighted in the first instance by a change in Reedus' lovemaking as one whose psyche is increasingly affected by the killer's manipulative mind games. And when the depressed cop buys a suit on impulse from a shop woman with whom he later sleeps in aggressive fashion we are reminded of how moral codes can be put and 'worn' almost as one would clothes until one can't tell where the suit ends and the man begins. But by the same mark are never the less separate and can be peeled back to reveal the real creature underneath or changed at will.The signs that accompany the disturbed personality are more than just at that mundane level however. We are reminded in this film of the 'Holy Trinity' of serial killers playing with fire tormenting animals and bedwetting  some signs of which the tortured cop discovers with growing alarm occurring within his own family. As mentioned above a strong religious thread runs through the film of which this is only another aspect. Schmizt's family are devoted churchgoing folk bible quotations play an especial significance and at one point the cop seeks to make his confession. But God's benign influence is ultimately conspicuous by its absence rather than influence the final resolution less due to any supernatural grace than human doubt. In fact in interview director Alvart has expressed his serial killer in terms of the criminal representing 'total doubt' whilst drawing a parallel between religious fanaticism and the extremes of criminal behaviour each with their respective compulsions.In short Antibodies is well worth seeking out as a serial killer film that's both thought provoking and reasonably gripping  and can also be taken as a possible antidote to Hannibal Rising. Alvart is clearly a talent to watch his previous and first film Curiosity And The Cat 1999 was a little seen  at least in the UK  but well thought of suspense flick that also featuring corroding suspicion and sadomasochistic overtones. One hopes to see more of his work.".

	schema:headline " Silence of the Deer";
	schema:reviewBody "You might think that Antibodies is very similar to Silence of the Lambs. I've even heard one person describing it as a ripoff of it but I don't see that in Antibodies. The only similarities is that the serialkiller here a revolting paedophile instead of a harmless cannibal and the detective feature key scenes across bars. That's it! Antibodies is more about solving the case of a murdered little girl who the serial killer refuses to admit to killing. Whereas the Silence of the Lambs was more about Jodie Foster on the tail of a whole new serial killer altogether! That being said of course Antibodies is not as great as the Silence of the Lambs but it is a super solid serial killer thriller that offers so much more than you'd imagine.Antibodies is dangerously underrated. It seems to me that hardly anyone has seen it and I can't understand why. I came across it on IMDb by accident and the poster caught my eye with its sinister focal image and clinical background. There's no reason why Antibodies should not appeal to mass audiences other than it being in German which lazy people who have probably not even given subtitled films a chance! send away. Antibodies looks amazing it's made on a very decent budget has fantastic acting and a wonderfully twisty script. At two hours long Antibodies never sags and I was even kind of sad to see it end because it's such a gripping experience.Antibodies grabs you by the throat from the stylish opening where the mad man's apartment is stormed by police officers. Here we're bombarded with religious imagery which can often seem a bit pompous but in Antibodies it serves a very intelligent purpose and only adds to the brilliant screenplay. We're given striking imagery of a naked psychopath and it could've easily leaped out of a Hollywood film with its bigbudget feel. However unlike most Hollywood productions it features an edgy screenplay as well as great visuals. It's no surprise that Hollywood is eating this up! What the screenplay does so well is getting into the minds of its characters. Our detective is no less interesting than the psychopath himself well maybe slightly but psychopaths have an unfair advantage of being interesting. We're let into the detective's everyday life and we see his strengths and flaws as a characters. No doubt the remake will feature a pure detective which will completely miss the whole idea of the film. I loved seeing his character change from being cool and collected and then being completely tormented by Gabriel the psychopath who is definitely no angel.Just like in the Silence of the Lambs the interrogation scenes feature astonishingly gripping dialogue as we become as entangled in the mystery as much as the detective is. There are also some very interesting uses of camera angles. In fact the whole film moves at a great pace and has a speedy energy which you wouldn't expect from a film that lasts two hours. Antibodies never drags and you always care. The film is never afraid to be cruel and brutal in its characterisation and it's right not to hold back. It's important to note that people like Gabriel do exist and we can't just shut the out!There are a few jawdropping twists at the end which only show off the brilliant nature of the screenplay. There are some very intense sequences that had me on the edge of my seat. The character of the detective is also never ignored and he rightly remains central to the story as we see him being led into temptation amongst other things. Antibodies is a thrilling experience and a highclass serial killer thriller. It certainly has the dark elements of horror like the Silence of the Lambs has yet it adds a brilliant spin on the subgenre that should have you on the edge of your seat. This is topnotch entertainment with a heart at the centre of it. See it before Hollywood squashes it!".

The only similarities is that the serialkiller here a revolting paedophile instead of a harmless cannibal and the detective feature key scenes across bars. That's it! Antibodies is more about solving the case of a murdered little girl who the serial killer refuses to admit to killing. Whereas the Silence of the Lambs was more about Jodie Foster on the tail of a whole new serial killer altogether! That being said of course Antibodies is not as great as the Silence of the Lambs but it is a super solid serial killer thriller that offers so much more than you'd imagine.Antibodies is dangerously underrated. It seems to me that hardly anyone has seen it and I can't understand why. I came across it on IMDb by accident and the poster caught my eye with its sinister focal image and clinical background. There's no reason why Antibodies should not appeal to mass audiences other than it being in German which lazy people who have probably not even given subtitled films a chance! send away. Antibodies looks amazing it's made on a very decent budget has fantastic acting and a wonderfully twisty script. At two hours long Antibodies never sags and I was even kind of sad to see it end because it's such a gripping experience.Antibodies grabs you by the throat from the stylish opening where the mad man's apartment is stormed by police officers. Here we're bombarded with religious imagery which can often seem a bit pompous but in Antibodies it serves a very intelligent purpose and only adds to the brilliant screenplay. We're given striking imagery of a naked psychopath and it could've easily leaped out of a Hollywood film with its bigbudget feel. However unlike most Hollywood productions it features an edgy screenplay as well as great visuals. It's no surprise that Hollywood is eating this up! What the screenplay does so well is getting into the minds of its characters. Our detective is no less interesting than the psychopath himself well maybe slightly but psychopaths have an unfair advantage of being interesting. We're let into the detective's everyday life and we see his strengths and flaws as a characters. No doubt the remake will feature a pure detective which will completely miss the whole idea of the film. I loved seeing his character change from being cool and collected and then being completely tormented by Gabriel the psychopath who is definitely no angel.Just like in the Silence of the Lambs the interrogation scenes feature astonishingly gripping dialogue as we become as entangled in the mystery as much as the detective is. There are also some very interesting uses of camera angles. In fact the whole film moves at a great pace and has a speedy energy which you wouldn't expect from a film that lasts two hours. Antibodies never drags and you always care. The film is never afraid to be cruel and brutal in its characterisation and it's right not to hold back. It's important to note that people like Gabriel do exist and we can't just shut the out!There are a few jawdropping twists at the end which only show off the brilliant nature of the screenplay. There are some very intense sequences that had me on the edge of my seat. The character of the detective is also never ignored and he rightly remains central to the story as we see him being led into temptation amongst other things. Antibodies is a thrilling experience and a highclass serial killer thriller. It certainly has the dark elements of horror like the Silence of the Lambs has yet it adds a brilliant spin on the subgenre that should have you on the edge of your seat. This is topnotch entertainment with a heart at the centre of it. See it before Hollywood squashes it!";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very dark very twisted very well made serial killer flick that has much in common with Michael Mann's Manhunter and Demme's Silence of the Lambs. It has what some would call an aberrant sexual slant. After a suspected serial killer with a Hannibal Lectorstyle genius is finally captured a country cop is brought in to get the psychopath to spill his guts. What he spills embroils the cop in a complex web of dark sexuality and strange discoveries involving his own family. Director Christian Alvert maintains the tension and does not shy away from disturbing imagery. The material involving the murders of children is potent but not gory. One scene involving a girl slashed upwards from the vagina is suitably horrific. Special mention must go to composer Michl Britsch for his disturbing industrial score. This grim German film that explores the darkest recesses of human behavior is an absolute winner.".

It also covers the strained relationship between townspeople and the local constabulary as well as how a small town officer fares when dealing with big city police investigators some of whom do not appreciate his assistance.On a larger scale it ponders the place of religion in modern society especially as it pertains to the nature of good and evil.

It tells the story about farmer and police officer Michael Martens who lives in a catholic village in the German countryside called Herzbach with his wife Rosa their daughter Sara and their 13yearold son Christan. The police officer and citizens in the small community have been marked by an unsolved serial murder case for the last six years and is still troubled by suspicions and doubts but then a special unit headed by chief commissioner Seiler arrests a suspect named Gabriel Engel in Berlin.

But wow.... the movie has the look and feel of a ordinary German TV production and the general problem many German productions... it copies Hollywood styles in a redundant fashion and spices it up with inferior acting and ordinary pictures.The basic plot of Antikrper is such an incredibly blunt ripoff from what you at first parallel to Silence of the lambs but you can smell the ending after about 20 Minutes and all that is a plain and dumb Seven ripoff which fasten your seat belts even dares changing it to a happy end.You get the smart serial killer the insecure cop and those interrogation sequences Hopkins made so famous. I guess they know how flat out plagiarized their movie is so they even includes some smug jokes about Silence of the lambs. The interrogation sequence like many other scenes is edited choppy and uneven. The movie looks as German as it gets and then even switches to unnecessary and wiggly helicopterscenes like in Silence.... Ridiculous. The acting of the cops son is bad and hints are dropped in so obviously that you know whats coming up as soon as you see red squares in this movie and the other red herrings get really boring.A lot of the dialog is painfully uneven the tough cop and everything around him is as cheap as it gets. The script is a complete ripoff and even the cheesy twist in the end which refers back to the regular religious comments felt like I saw the ending in another movie... at least they stole from a third one here. Anyway it feels like someone just edited in a scene to show off that they can do some decent CGI after a lot before looked fake.I don't get why this movie was so well received. I think its really lame and can't understand why someone would plagiarize such famous movies with such an inferior clone. I have to admit that if you look close the later movies of Alvart suffer an equal lack of core inspiration but neither the disappointing and disjointed Pandorum nor Case 39 the hundredth Evil Children Movie alone in the last year come near the flatout plagiarism of Antikrper.".

After an overtly long 90 minutes the film reaches it's Se7enlite stage but doesn't have the guts to go through with it. The acting is rather wooden especially on the part of Wotan Wilke Mhring's small town cop Michael Martens. The killer played by Andre' Hennicke tries his best to be as menacing as possible but never really convinces. Heinz Hoenigs streetsmart bigcity cop is purest camp but sadly not of the good kind. To make things short  if you want to see a good and new serial killer film go see Saw or wait for the sequel. If you want to see a fun and genuine German killer flick see Anatomie.

	schema:reviewBody "This was a pretty good police thriller. Someone recommended it as a horror but really there is nothing to promote horror in the film. It is though promoting all kind of nasty feelings.The story is pretty complex but shortened to extreme it is about a small village cop who goes to meet a captured serial killer in order to determine if the only sexual murder that took place in their small catholic community is the murderer's doing or not. You see as an outstandingly nice person he needs to know that none of the people in his village are the authors of such a heinous crime.From then on it's pretty much Silence of the Lambs only a lot better since German killers are clearly more scary than American ones albeit not so flashy. There is even a jab when the killer first meets the cop he says who did you expect? Hannibal Lecter?. And it was something very creepy about such a nice guy that is surrounded by assholes and still kept his cool all the time. I would have tortured and killed someone that would kill my dog accidentally or not.For a German film I thought it was very well done with top notch performances production quality and overall feeling. I do have some issues with it though. Firstly the name is so misleading. I was rooting for a biological horror film and I got this. Then it was really long for a slow thriller two hours long. Shorter would have been better I say. And lastly the Bible quoting ending. Was that truly necessary?Bottom line a nice thriller with great performances. Andr Hennicke interpreting the killer is like a German Robert Knepper. So if you can imagine a Silence of the Lambs with no girls with Robert Knepper as the killer and probably Nicholas Cage as the cop replaying his Wicker Man role you would get a pretty similar US remake.".

But i noticed in my Fangoria vault and on the web that there was more and better coming a few years ago. Antibodies. First of all again like most German flicks they speak you guessed it German. Mostly without subs but this one does have them. So the language is never a problem. It's a slow movie that clocks in over more than 2 hours but don't worry you will never be bored. The difference between the Holywood movies and this one is that they dare to have a serial killer killing children and what he did with them is all told in an explicit way. For some it will be disturbing and that's the main difference with the US movies. Se7en and Silence of the Lambs were never disturbing except for the killers. But here we have more it tells a story about a serial killer who only wants to talk to a small cop meaning nothing in Berlin. What he has to do with killer will be explained further on in the movie. But the guys who are playing the killer and the cop are sublime. The way the cop becomes victim of the killer and how he translate that in his belief in Christ. A must see. I must admit that you will get the plot halfway into the movie but you want to be sure that it is correct that's the reason to watch it until the end. Strange for this kind of flicks but no gore is added you will see some blood but I can tell it get you by the throat due the child abuse and killings done by him. For me as a horror geek I surely advise people to see this underrated movie and yes in 2010 or dearest American folks are making a remake. Do I need to say more?".

Boring badly acted terrible script halfaed plot  no suspense or thrills or scares. I didn't care about the characters only about the poor animals unfortunate enough to be in this flick. The direction was terrible and the fanatical religious voice over was as irritating as I imagine hell to be.Everything anyone did was dragged out with long periods of nothing happening. So for example noone could just walk into a room and pick up something they came for. No no. They had to stare at the door for a while move slowly to the doorway think about opening the door push the door open but stand around pondering whether to enter... you know what I mean. Something a lot of European dramas are infected with  this bizarre notion that the way to build suspense is to have absolutely nothing happen or have characters act like they're all on tranquilizers. This doesn't build suspense it just builds frustration  boredom and causes much hitting of fast forward controls. This characteristic had put me off European films for many years until I found a couple of brilliant ones recently. This flick just set my opinion back again sadly.The movie tries very hard to be dark but instead just comes across as pointlessly cruel revolting and ludicrous. The shooting of the dog scene for example occurred at the beginning of the film as one very annoying ugly old bloke shot his soninlaws dog just for the fun of it. This sick scene actually bore no relationship to anything else going on in the plot and never did. It seemed to be just stuck in there because they were trying for dark  disturbing and thought Hey people get upset by dogs getting hurt or killed so let's put a pointless 'dog getting killed' scene in the flick. Another scene involving a very young lamb was also concerning because it looked real when the lamb panicked and ran into the fence so I'm guessing they actually tormented the sheep to get that footage. What a pity they couldn't have used their awesome CGI skills instead you know the ones they later brought in to ludicrous effect when they had the world's most fake looking bunch of deer showing up as God's divine representatives or whatever they were supposed to be to 'save the day'. We were laughing our bottoms off at that point.If animal abuse isn't enough there's always the child abuse angle. And no I'm not entertained by a long detailed monologue about how I raped and murdered a young boy while the speaker masturbates in front of me. That might have some appeal to pedophile predators but not to me and I hope not to the general viewing audience.And that ride of the Valkyries soundtrack in the closing scenes was the dumbest thing I've seenheard in a long long time.Seriously.... what on earth is this piece of rubbish doing with a 7 point rating? Honestly. Don't waste your time with this pollution.".

Those scenes are awkward saying it kindly and again Mhring makes as good a passionate lover as he does an inspector.There is an infinite number of Silence of the Lambs ripoffs and interpretations being produced internationally  save yourself Antikrper because in this two hours you could watch a better one anytime.3 out of 10  and that's called 'generous'.".

It is a poignant film that was considered daring at the time of its release and is now labeled by many as a cult classic. Tomas Milian who took the stage name Tomas after his prime role model Tomas F. Dobb plays Jed in an unforgettable role initially intended for Rodney Dangerfield. Susan George plays Sonny Jed's onetrue love and partnerincrime. This is a Bonnie and Clyde of the west. It isn't a great film but it seems to entertain most of the time. The best performance in the film by far is by Telly Savalas. He plays a blind sheriff who is determined to catch Sonny and Jed dead or alive by using any means necessary BY HIMSELF! Savalas steals every scene he is in and rightfully so. The final line in the film Sonny I love you you Mr! is right up there with the final line in Gone with the Wind.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is definitely not your average spaghetti western and it's uniqueness is part of what makes it great.There are really two separate stories being told in the film and they are both given equal weight. One of them is the chasing of Jed by a revenge seeking lawman played by Telly Savalas and the other is the dysfunctional love story of Sonny and Jed. Franciscus the character played by Savalas seems out of place in a spaghetti western wearing a long fur coat and basically being Kojak accent and all. He even talks more like he belongs in a 1970's cop movie than a western. In one part he even calls Jed a punk. I'm not sure but I don't think I've ever heard that word in a spaghetti western before this one. I love when spaghetti westerns have these offbeat characters that don't belong in a western. It always makes for a cool and interesting movie. In the middle of the film after Franciscus becomes disabled Savalas gets to portray him as a totally different character as his personality changes and his style of clothing becomes even more bizarre. He is truly great in this role.Tomas Milian plays the part of Jed a character similar to the one he portrayed in Companeros but a bit cruder. He is fantastic as usual. He plays this type of character perfectly. His antics are a lot of fun to watch. He even eats spaghetti in this movie! I've always wanted to see that in a spaghetti western. Susan George is good for the role of Sonny. There is one part where she uses 1960's slang when she speaks. You've just gotta love these Italian westerns!Ennio Morricone's score is brilliant and one of his more memorable. It is not the typical spaghetti western score but it fits and has that haunting Euromovie style.Definitely a must see for Eurowestern fans".

Although this is definitely a parody of the Sergio Leone classics including a fine Enio Morrocone score it could come as quite a shock to the Trinity crowd especially in the almost constant use of the F' word.

	schema:headline " Not up to Sergio Corbucci's more famous spaghettis not bad either";
	schema:reviewBody "It's surprising to see how fast Sergio Corbucci's career declined. Only two years earlier he was making COMPANEROS one of the highpoints of the mid spaghetti western period. For SONNY AND JED he united his 'muse' Tomas Milian with Susan George fresh from Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS the previous year and Tellys Savalas who was at the time enjoying a prolonged vacation in the Mediterranean by making Italian bmovies. Despite of the cast however the movie is a dim shadow of COMPANEROS. Certainly a letdown by Corbucci's usual standards which he would go on to follow with another two poor westerns essentially ending his career in the western as ingloriously it began MASSACRE AT RED CANYON.SONNY AND JED in its way reflects the ongoing the decline of the genre that Corbucci both helped shape and found his niche in by making the transition from the peplum he used to make under alias Stanley Corbett in his earlier days and with cheesy titles like Goliath and the Island of Vampires. It's a gritty crass vulgar tale of two unpleasant people scruffy bandit Jed and feisty tomboy Sonny hitching up together in a nameless patch of Roman countryside substituting for a nameless part of the West and going on a robbing spree while a monomaniac sheriff dressed in a fur ! and his posse gun after them. The coupleofcriminalsontheloose idea seems to be a loan from BONNY AND CLYDE and Milian and Susan George have enough chemistry to see it through even when their constant bickering crosses the line from amusing to annoying. Milian's Jed is cut from that mould of distinctly latino temperament the kind of uncomplicated picaresque irreverence Italians loved to introduce in their characters because it borough the western back home in a way which owes a big debt to Tuco from Leone's GBU as do all the characters of that lineage.In the end the movie doesn't amount to much and the questionable choice of undermining Tellys Savalas' suave menace by turning him from a cruel methodic badass into a staggering blind does a good job of cutting the legs from the movie's climax but it's still peppered with memorable moments that save the day. Great examples of spaghetti western visual irony involving coffins and barns snappy oneliners hilarious bits like the scene when Jed enters a photographer's shop and demands to know why his photo is missing from the Wanted posters he's printing a general sense of comicbook irreverence that is at once violent and funny Sonny and Jed although far from a rousing success still has enough of these little moments to recommend it to genre fans.".

	schema:headline " Not your average Spaghetti Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Guns and violence are pretty synonymous with the Spaghetti Western genre and while this film has all that stuff the real reason Bandits is so good is not because of it but because of the central characters and their relationship and works so well mostly thanks to excellent performances from the beautiful Susan George and the immensely talented Tomas Milian. The film takes obvious influence from the famous story of Bonnie and Clyde and indeed the most shocking thing about this film is the misogynistic nature of the lead male character. The story focuses on Jed a good for nothing bandit who has little respect for anybody friend or foe. His life is changed one day when he runs into a wannabe bandit by the name of Sonny who he later finds out much to his annoyance is a female. They get split up after a robbery goes wrong but fate soon brings the pair back together and they soon win themselves a reputation and have a price put on their head leading the determined Sheriff Franciscus to chase the pair stopping at nothing to bring them to justice.Bandits has two central plots we have the idea of the pair being wanted and chased by mercenaries and also the relationship between them. It's the latter plot that is by far the most interesting and the one that director Sergio Corbucci is most keen to focus on. He ensures that both of his central characters are extremely well fleshed out and this benefits the film immensely as the audience is really made to care for them. This genre is not well known for well put together characters so that makes this film all the more surprising. Tomas Milian is undoubtedly the film's biggest standout and I would have no qualms putting him right near the top of an all time greatest actors list. He leads the film amazingly well and we're never left in any doubt as to who the star of the show is. He gets good support from Susan George in one of her best roles and Telly Savalas who is effective as the lawman. It all boils down to a conclusion that brings closure to both of the main plots and while Sergio Corbucci will always be better remembered for Django and The Grand Silence this is still an excellent Spaghetti Western and not one to miss!".

His life is changed one day when he runs into a wannabe bandit by the name of Sonny who he later finds out much to his annoyance is a female. They get split up after a robbery goes wrong but fate soon brings the pair back together and they soon win themselves a reputation and have a price put on their head leading the determined Sheriff Franciscus to chase the pair stopping at nothing to bring them to justice.Bandits has two central plots we have the idea of the pair being wanted and chased by mercenaries and also the relationship between them. It's the latter plot that is by far the most interesting and the one that director Sergio Corbucci is most keen to focus on. He ensures that both of his central characters are extremely well fleshed out and this benefits the film immensely as the audience is really made to care for them. This genre is not well known for well put together characters so that makes this film all the more surprising. Tomas Milian is undoubtedly the film's biggest standout and I would have no qualms putting him right near the top of an all time greatest actors list. He leads the film amazingly well and we're never left in any doubt as to who the star of the show is. He gets good support from Susan George in one of her best roles and Telly Savalas who is effective as the lawman. It all boils down to a conclusion that brings closure to both of the main plots and while Sergio Corbucci will always be better remembered for Django and The Grand Silence this is still an excellent Spaghetti Western and not one to miss!";

Of course this is a Spagettii Western and a comedy but it is not your usual run of the mill type of film. There is plenty of vulgarity and romantic scenes and a rough relationship between Jed Tom Milian and Sonny Susan George. Jed is an very crude man who is a robber and he meets up with Sonny who seems to take a liking to him even though he treats her very poorly. Jed and Sonny become something like a Bonny  Clyde team who go around stealing and robbing everyone they come in contact with. Sheriff Franciscus Telly Savalvas is out to get these two people and even though he becomes blind still manages to try and hunt down these two criminals. This is a great film and if you get a chance don't miss this great Susan George Film.".

Besides the very good Tomas Milian's performance the witty dialogues the fabulous cast Susan George Telly Savalas Laura Betti the charming wintertime Almeria desert locations the fast pace of the narration and the excellent Morricone's score JS stands out for the memorable Jed and Sonny characters and for the love Corbucci shows once more for the losers the marginals and the misfits. There's no clue Corbucci made it just to be on the track of then boxoffice Spaghettiwestern hits like e.g. Trinit. JS is a genuine tale about two people trying to survive and keep their freedom in a world which didn't give them any chance. References to Bonnie  Clyde? Not so many. More simply Corbucci and his writers face the theme of the criminal couple on the run and do it with an original and witty point of view. Which here seems to be the dichotomy nature vs. society. And if you think Corbucci is chauvinist in the way he describes the relationship between Jed and Sonny at the beginning Jed treats his woman literally like a dog wait until the ironic end of the movie to express your judgement.

	schema:headline " One of the Best Vampire Films Ever Made";
	schema:reviewBody "Paul Naschy the Werewolf Prince of European cinema portrays the tortured Waldemar in this film of many titles. The movie kicks off with Naschy resting on a medical table  preparing to be autopsied. Two silver bullets are removed from Naschy's chest thus reviving him. He changes into a werewolf and slaughters the two doctors performing the autopsy.Afterwards we are introduced to a redheaded student Gaby Fuchs who takes her friend Barbara Capell out to the countryside to search for the tomb of a fabled governess. Away from modern convenience the girls meet Naschy who is hiding out in a castle with his depraved sister. He takes the girls in and looks after them while his demented sister takes a liking to each of the girls  physically. The following day Naschy leads the two girls to the tomb and they dig up the corpse of the governess  Capell cutting her arm and having droplets of her blood fall into the governesses open mouth. Then the fun starts.The main draw for this film is the stellar direction. I enjoy horror films of the 70's because they relied more on atmosphere rather than blood and guts to convey terror. Any director can slop red paint on a wall or pull fake entrails out of a plastic dummy but only the great directors can convey dread through atmospheric methods. The scenes where the governess Patty Sheperd and Barbara Capell stalk about the woods at night in slow motion makes for a filmgoers delight. Their flowing gowns slowmoving steps and pale makeup make for true dread. There isn't a single vampire film I would recommend over this treat.VIOLENCE  There is a spattering of violence in this film but nothing on the level of the tasteless trash that Hollywood churns out nowadays. The opening scene is the most violent when Naschy kills the two doctors and then snacks on a damsel in the countryside. The vampires weren't used in the violence department  just the eerie department.STORY  Rather routine but fun nonetheless. A werewolf tortured by his curse tries to keep his new flame Fuchs from the clutches of the vampires as well as himself. When he turns he can't control his bloodlust thus placing Gaby in a perilous situation. The plot line of students staying in an abandoned castle while on academic furlough is a bit too overused but it works here.ACTING  As with most of these European horror films it is difficult to tell how good of an actor the thespians are because their lines are dubbed in English. However it is obvious that Naschy can portray selfinflicted torture with the best of them.

	onyx:emotionText "Paul Naschy the Werewolf Prince of European cinema portrays the tortured Waldemar in this film of many titles. The movie kicks off with Naschy resting on a medical table  preparing to be autopsied. Two silver bullets are removed from Naschy's chest thus reviving him. He changes into a werewolf and slaughters the two doctors performing the autopsy.Afterwards we are introduced to a redheaded student Gaby Fuchs who takes her friend Barbara Capell out to the countryside to search for the tomb of a fabled governess. Away from modern convenience the girls meet Naschy who is hiding out in a castle with his depraved sister. He takes the girls in and looks after them while his demented sister takes a liking to each of the girls  physically. The following day Naschy leads the two girls to the tomb and they dig up the corpse of the governess  Capell cutting her arm and having droplets of her blood fall into the governesses open mouth. Then the fun starts.The main draw for this film is the stellar direction. I enjoy horror films of the 70's because they relied more on atmosphere rather than blood and guts to convey terror. Any director can slop red paint on a wall or pull fake entrails out of a plastic dummy but only the great directors can convey dread through atmospheric methods. The scenes where the governess Patty Sheperd and Barbara Capell stalk about the woods at night in slow motion makes for a filmgoers delight. Their flowing gowns slowmoving steps and pale makeup make for true dread. There isn't a single vampire film I would recommend over this treat.VIOLENCE  There is a spattering of violence in this film but nothing on the level of the tasteless trash that Hollywood churns out nowadays. The opening scene is the most violent when Naschy kills the two doctors and then snacks on a damsel in the countryside. The vampires weren't used in the violence department  just the eerie department.STORY  Rather routine but fun nonetheless. A werewolf tortured by his curse tries to keep his new flame Fuchs from the clutches of the vampires as well as himself. When he turns he can't control his bloodlust thus placing Gaby in a perilous situation. The plot line of students staying in an abandoned castle while on academic furlough is a bit too overused but it works here.ACTING  As with most of these European horror films it is difficult to tell how good of an actor the thespians are because their lines are dubbed in English. However it is obvious that Naschy can portray selfinflicted torture with the best of them. Patty Sheperd who I can't recall having any dialogue was creepy as the governess and Barbara Capell is tantalizing and sensual in any language.NUDITY  Very little  of the blinkandyoumissedit variety. Naschy tears open the blouse of the girl he kills in the country and Capell gets her blouse ripped open by Naschy's twisted sister. It isn't sleazy and you see very little but it is gratuitous.";

	schema:headline " A true classic of Spanish Gothic horror";
	schema:reviewBody "A classic slice of Spanish exploitation this is Euro Horror at its finest. It runs like a Hammer film and contains many of the usual Gothic traditions  crucifixes atmosphere ruined graveyards vampires witches werewolves manacles and deserted castles. The film is even set in an unspecified European locale Northern France is mentioned but this doesn't look much like France to me so beloved of the Hammer studio. However as this is a Spanish exploitation film and the Europeans were always less prudish than their British counterparts there are the added touches of nudity whenever women fight their tops get torn off unsurprisingly and more gore than we would usually expect from a fantasy piece about classic monsters like this. The gore is really icing on the cake though as the film is strong enough to stand up without it.Highlights include the scene where Naschy kills his vampire sister and the final sequence where the witch dissolves into a maggotcovered skeleton. In the former we watch as Naschy nonchalantly hammers a stake with a huge mallet! into his sister's chest watching blood erupt from the wound and then hacks her head off with an axe  all portrayed in a jawdroppingly matteroffact way! The latter death scene is highly reminiscent of the influential Hammer Dracula deaths once again a wax model being used to make it look like the corpse is decaying. A wonderfully over the top moment in a brilliant film.This was my first exposure to Naschy's films and I have to say that I am greatly impressed. It would have been easy to let the gore run riot no harm in that and while the film isn't restrained it also succeeds in building the type of atmosphere favoured by classic horror films from the decades before it. As a matter of interest two of the classic monsters of the horror film are involved and zombies and even the devil well his shadow anyway turn up in bit parts. Naschy has said that he's fond of the Universal monster bashes of the 1940s where one monster was teamed against another and the evidence is clear here. The violent werewolf scenes are pretty good although Naschy looks slightly comedic he is still excellent value for money. The only problem would be the poor quality of the makeup which admittedly looks rather bad. The evil witch is intimidating and evokes Barbara Steele in her black robes and veil. Add to that the subplot of vampirism and you have a film well worth watching.The locations are nice the atmosphere is brilliant the acting although affected by dubbing is nonetheless more than adequate with Naschy particularly excelling himself in his role. Never since the days Lon Chaney Jr. played Lawrence Talbot have we had such a wellportrayed and charismatic character consumed by his werewolf hunger and forced to kill in a series of films. Naschy certainly knows his stuff and he makes for a very memorable leading hero in his leather jacket. There are a couple of surprisingly touching romantic interludes between Naschy and Fuchs achieved via a bit of tinkling piano music. The rest of the female cast is either required to strip or look spooky! Another guy a policeman looks like the spitting image of Gregory Peck.Okay the film itself is not particularly well made down to the lack of budget more than anything else but there are some nice bits of editing the repeat flashes from Naschy to the full moon and back again are rather good and it could have been a lot worse. The only problem comes when one piece of footage is accidentally repeated twice making things truly weird. Watch out for an excellent scene where a girl is attacked by a decayed monk in the ruined castle. Could this be one of the undead Templars from TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD making a guest appearance? It sure looks like it! The film has all you could ever want from a horror film violence gore action suspense atmosphere romance and characters you feel for. The only hurdle would be the obvious cultural barrier and the fact that you have to ignore that it's poorly dubbed. If you can get over that this is an excellent slice of horror from a muchmaligned age. This film has certainly led to a desire within me not unlike the craving of a bloodthirsty vampire to see more of Naschy's yarns and on recent second viewing it was just as good again.".

Bmovie cult actor Paul Naschy stars in the role of the Werewolf Waldemar Daninsky the fourth time a role which he has played 13 times so far. Naschy whose name stands for pure cult for exploitation lovers like myself also wrote the screenplay for this film as he did for many of the movies he starred in. The film furthermore features a beautiful female cast Gaby Fuchs Barbara Capell and Patty Shepard especially Capell is very very hot and in spite of an obviously minimal budget many scenes are very stylishly made allthough its sometimes overdone as nearly all creepy moments are done in slowmo.The Werewolf Vs. Vampire Women isn't a masterpiece. Nonetheless it is a highly entertaining and interesting film that should not be missed by serious lovers of Eurohorror. The film may have its lengths throughout the middle but it is also stylishly made and quite creepy in many parts and definitely worth he time for a genrefan.

	schema:reviewBody "The Werewolf vs the Vampire Woman wastes lots of great Gothic elements in plodding through it's too long running time.  The ideas are there but thoroughly unrealized by Director Leon Klimovsky as one boring scene follows another generating little or no tension or interest.  Scenes from this flick look great as stills  when moving they leave a lot to be desired.Paul Naschy's acting talents never advanced beyond high school play status in any of his filmic endeavors.  He reacts to most of the outlandish goingson with his usual impassiveness as though his scenes were for blocking purposes only.  When his character Waldemar Daninsky transforms into the werewolf of the title Naschy employs body slams punches and armswipes as though he were on the undercard of a poorly rehearsed wrestling match.  The climatic battle between Vampiress and Werewolf is underwhelming in its embarrassing lack of action.

The ideas are there but thoroughly unrealized by Director Leon Klimovsky as one boring scene follows another generating little or no tension or interest.  Scenes from this flick look great as stills  when moving they leave a lot to be desired.Paul Naschy's acting talents never advanced beyond high school play status in any of his filmic endeavors.  He reacts to most of the outlandish goingson with his usual impassiveness as though his scenes were for blocking purposes only.  When his character Waldemar Daninsky transforms into the werewolf of the title Naschy employs body slams punches and armswipes as though he were on the undercard of a poorly rehearsed wrestling match.  The climatic battle between Vampiress and Werewolf is underwhelming in its embarrassing lack of action.

	schema:headline " Just a shadow of other fairytale horror films";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing I noticed about this film was the completely inane dialogue and unfortunately there is a streak of ineptitude running throughout Werewolf Shadow and this is a shame as without it this film actually isn't bad at all. The principle positive element is without doubt the atmosphere as Len Klimovsky's film features a surreal dreamlike ambiance which bodes extremely well with the fantasyhorror elements of the rather unoriginal plot line. As the title suggests the film handles the stalwart horror monster 'the werewolf' and it does it in an almost fairytale like manner. This again ensures disappointment as films like Suspiria have shown what a great effect a fairytale plot line can have on a film although this film proves otherwise. The plot centres on two girls Elvira and Genevieve who find themselves travelling through the French countryside in search of a medieval tomb believed to that of a murderess. However they happen to run into Waldemar Daninsky a Count with a secret who invites the girls to stay at his castle.The film is probably most notable for the fact that it stars prolific Spanish horror veteran Paul Naschy. I have to admit that I've only seen a handful of Naschy's films but they've ranged from bad to worse and personally I'm not a big fan of what I've seen thus far. In this film Naschy doesn't get to do much more than chew the scenery anyway. The acting isn't the best overall and the special effects leave a lot to be desired also. The gloomy Gothic atmosphere is definitely a treat however and it really is a good job as if it wasn't for that the film wouldn't be worth watching at all. Werewolf Shadow isn't a very long film lasting just over eighty minutes but it really does drag as the plot simply moves along without ever being too interesting. Director Len Klimovsky does pad his film out with some very nice imagery however and the film does look very nice on a number of occasions. Overall I really can't recommend going out of your way to find Werewolf Shadow all of its elements have been done better in other films and despite some nice aesthetics this is a sadly lacklustre effort.".

I was around 13 years old and thought that i had discovered the greatest movie ever made by the hands of mortal men. Perhaps not but it sure is good fun.Molina  Naschy here portrays the eternal werewolf Waldemar Daninsky for around the third or fourth time  not that these movies have any real continuity between them at all  reanimated by a foolish pathologist removing the silver bullets from his heart.

Wandessa is revived and rises from the grave to do battle with heroic lycanthrope Waldemar but not before putting the bite on the lovely Genevieve in a decidedly Sapphic deadly embrace. Sadly our furry friend has to dispatch this newly created Gallic ghoul as well as his own vampirised sister in a gruesomely fun scene of staking and beheading. It's hard to feel sad at this fraternal strife however as said sister was partial even when human to a spot of incoherent rambling and lesbian rape. It takes a lot to make your werewolf brother look like the acceptable sibling.After slashing up a forestdwelling hobo and eating the throat of handyman Pierre who does kidnap and rape on the weekends Waldemar has his final showdown with Wandessa the Werewolf vs. the Vampire Woman battle of the movie's less than subtle US title. These twin titans of terror engage in a fight to the undeath in the final reel. I advise any sensible viewer to stop the tape or disc before Genevieve's annoying cop exboyfriend I think he's called Marcel but he's known in our house as Sneb is magically released from his chains.

From the very beginning it should be clear to anyone that a movie with Paul Naschy and under the English title of The Werewolf vs. The Vampire Women is not going to be precisely the kind of horror movie anyone would take seriously. Not because Mr. Naschy cannot be taken seriously. As a matter of fact I acknowledge him as a Latin horror legend and he has been in some of the finest horror films in Spanish I have seen such as Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll for instance. On the other hand this multifaceted actor is also wellknown for being in some of the most bizarre and random horror movies throughout the 60s and 70s. With this cute little horror flick I mistakenly anticipated myself to a little bit of tasteless amusement that in the long run was going to earn my reverences. If there wasn't any good gore then at least I would have expected unintentionally humorous results but sadly this film fails to deliver the expected elements of entertainment that a horror fan would imagine in a film of this kind.In La Noche de Warpugis Elvira and Genevive go to the French countryside with the intention of making some enquiries about a wicked Countess named Wandessa who lived through the 13th century and who was recognized for devoting herself to Satan among other things. When the journey is about to come to an end Elvira's car runs out of gas and the girls finds themselves lost in the middle of the French nowhere with no one else in the area to give them a hand. Luckily Elvira and Genevive find relief when a mysterious man named Waldemar appears out of the blue to offer them a place to stay before the night falls. However Mr. Valdemar is actually a really enchanting little werewolf who lives with his crazy sister hidden inside the house and while he intends to be a normal person with good manners his ferocious nature forces him to be wild and dangerous to be friends with. As if this wasn't already enough Countess Wandessa who has been sleeping for centuries suddenly revives and goes back to her old tricks again without expecting an equally strong rival like Waldemar who won't let her get away with the same wicked behavior she once had. In The Night of the Walpurgis the werewolf and the vampire women find themselves battling in a dull and banal encounter in which the viewers are the only ones who actually lose.Too bad this film was so below my expectations. Like I said before I expected at least some decent childishness to amuse myself. There's basically no gore whatsoever and the few death scenes are rather effortless and insipid. Several films with Paul Naschy are wellknown for having a little bit of everything so I supposse I should give a friendly warning to anyone who thinks La Noche de Walpurgis is also going to be like this. Honestly I got so bored watching this film that in the end the only reason why I didn't leave it incomplete it's because I wanted to see if something would save it during the last minutes. Unfortunately the silly opening sequence is about as good as it gets all the way trough.".

	schema:reviewBody "La Noche de Walpurgis or the ridiculous sounding The Werewolf Vs. Vampire Woman or the better sounding but still irrelevant Werewolf Shadow as it's known amongst English speaking audiences starts at a local mortuary where Dr. Hartwig Julio Pena  his assistant Muller Bernabe Barta Barri are carrying out a postmortem on Waldemar Daninsky Jacinto Molina under his usual pseudonym Paul Naschy a suspected Werewolf who has been shot with silver bullets. After removing the bullets Daninsky comes back to life as a werewolf attacks Hartwig  Muller then kills a local girl. Meanwhile a student named Elvira Gaby Fuchs is writing an essay on blackmagic witchcraft  in particular a Countess Wandessa d'Arville da Nadasdy Patty Shepard whom was said to be a Vampire  Satan worshipper 100's of years ago. Together with her friend Genevieve Barbara Capell  a document which reveals where Wandessa's tomb is located Elvira travels to a remote part of North France  bumps into Waldemar who offers the two women a place to stay. It's not long before things take a turn for the worse as Waldmar's mentally disturbed sister Elizabeth Yelena Samarina warns them to leave the area they discover blood stained walls  manacles in the shed Waldemar somehow isn't as he appears  when Wandessa's tomb is opened she is resurrected form the dead to terrorise the local area once again with various bodies turning up having been drained of blood...This Spanish German coproduction was directed by Leon Klimovsky  isn't as bad as I was anticipating it's far from a masterpiece but I thought it was a fairly decent way to pass an hour  a half. The version I saw was the Anchor Bay DVD with the extra few minutes of dialogue that was obviously never dubbed into English  therefore is presented in Spanish with subtitles this extra footage adds nothing  in fact I'd prefer to have not had this put back in as it slows the pace of the film down  is frankly boring. Anyway the script by star Molina as James Molin how many pseudonym's does this guy have?  Hans Munkel has plenty of the elements that most rabid Euro horror fans will be looking for like Vampires Werewolves blood superstitious locals pretty girls idiotic dialogue  nudity. Hey what more do you want? A decent coherent story perhaps? The character's are dull  don't act in the way a normal human being would in the situations they find themselves in I didn't buy the relationship between Daninsky  Elvira for a second  it just seemed so fake  contrived. The various themes  ideas in La Noche de Walpurgis come  go without much regard for continuity the Werewolf  Vampires appear sporadically throughout often being completely forgotten about for long period's. Having said that that the film moves a long at a nice pace  never really becomes boring expect at the end but that's the extra footage for you with a decent amount of monster action although the climatic fight at the end is nothing more than two people rolling around on the floor. Director Klimovsky manges to create some great scenes  atmosphere with the Vampires moving in slow motion  for some reason he has them jump off something whenever they appear I also liked Wandessa's outfit with her black veil. On the down side the constant dayfornight shots become irritating  undo some of his good work. I loved the locations used the Church ruins  local architecture is fantastic  gives La Noche de Walpurgis a really nice look that the film itself doesn't deserve. Technically the film is solid with nice production values cinematography music  special effects.

	onyx:emotionText "La Noche de Walpurgis or the ridiculous sounding The Werewolf Vs. Vampire Woman or the better sounding but still irrelevant Werewolf Shadow as it's known amongst English speaking audiences starts at a local mortuary where Dr. Hartwig Julio Pena  his assistant Muller Bernabe Barta Barri are carrying out a postmortem on Waldemar Daninsky Jacinto Molina under his usual pseudonym Paul Naschy a suspected Werewolf who has been shot with silver bullets. After removing the bullets Daninsky comes back to life as a werewolf attacks Hartwig  Muller then kills a local girl. Meanwhile a student named Elvira Gaby Fuchs is writing an essay on blackmagic witchcraft  in particular a Countess Wandessa d'Arville da Nadasdy Patty Shepard whom was said to be a Vampire  Satan worshipper 100's of years ago. Together with her friend Genevieve Barbara Capell  a document which reveals where Wandessa's tomb is located Elvira travels to a remote part of North France  bumps into Waldemar who offers the two women a place to stay. It's not long before things take a turn for the worse as Waldmar's mentally disturbed sister Elizabeth Yelena Samarina warns them to leave the area they discover blood stained walls  manacles in the shed Waldemar somehow isn't as he appears  when Wandessa's tomb is opened she is resurrected form the dead to terrorise the local area once again with various bodies turning up having been drained of blood...This Spanish German coproduction was directed by Leon Klimovsky  isn't as bad as I was anticipating it's far from a masterpiece but I thought it was a fairly decent way to pass an hour  a half. The version I saw was the Anchor Bay DVD with the extra few minutes of dialogue that was obviously never dubbed into English  therefore is presented in Spanish with subtitles this extra footage adds nothing  in fact I'd prefer to have not had this put back in as it slows the pace of the film down  is frankly boring. Anyway the script by star Molina as James Molin how many pseudonym's does this guy have?  Hans Munkel has plenty of the elements that most rabid Euro horror fans will be looking for like Vampires Werewolves blood superstitious locals pretty girls idiotic dialogue  nudity. Hey what more do you want? A decent coherent story perhaps? The character's are dull  don't act in the way a normal human being would in the situations they find themselves in I didn't buy the relationship between Daninsky  Elvira for a second  it just seemed so fake  contrived. The various themes  ideas in La Noche de Walpurgis come  go without much regard for continuity the Werewolf  Vampires appear sporadically throughout often being completely forgotten about for long period's. Having said that that the film moves a long at a nice pace  never really becomes boring expect at the end but that's the extra footage for you with a decent amount of monster action although the climatic fight at the end is nothing more than two people rolling around on the floor. Director Klimovsky manges to create some great scenes  atmosphere with the Vampires moving in slow motion  for some reason he has them jump off something whenever they appear I also liked Wandessa's outfit with her black veil. On the down side the constant dayfornight shots become irritating  undo some of his good work. I loved the locations used the Church ruins  local architecture is fantastic  gives La Noche de Walpurgis a really nice look that the film itself doesn't deserve. Technically the film is solid with nice production values cinematography music  special effects. There are some gore scenes here a woman is bitten on the neck with lots of her blood running over her naked breasts a couple of stakes through the heart some Vampirism  neck biting a decapitation  a melting Vampire. The acting is obviously lessened by the bad English dub but it probably wasn't any good anyway leading ladies Fuchs  Capell are both very attractive if you know what I mean...

	schema:reviewBody "Vorstadtkrokodile 3 is the last one from the trilogy that was loosely based on Max Von Der Grn's novel and the 1977 film. Actually only the first film from 2009 was really based on the original movie. Still this third entry here was the commercially most successful film even if it did not really have anything to do with the original story anymore. One of the kids has a heavy accident and needs a liver transplant from his brother who is in jail sadly. So you could say that it is about physical weakness once again if you are generous as this is a theme that keeps showing up in this franchise.The wheelchair kid was missing for almost the entire movie. I did like the final scene however. At this point it was very clear that there would be no fourth movie anymore as the kids had simply grown up at this point. And at one point one of them makes a quote about how they are possibly too old for this whole gang adventure thing. There is a major plothole here though. In the 2009 movie we hear that the brother drinks lots of booze so he should have been denied the possibility of being a donor just like the father is. Anyway this film runs for much shorter than the first two and only lasts for 80 minutes and that is already with the closing credits. Christian Ditter who directed movies 1 and 2 is gone so Wolfgang Groos takes over. Also almost all the known grown up actors do not reappear here with the exception of Nora Tschirner who is in all 3 films just like the kids. However they included some famous new faces again Horst Lichter Michael Kessler Jochen Nickel and two actors who you may have seen on the long running critically acclaimed television series Stromberg and Mein Leben  Ich. Hans Martin Stier is not too known but he stole pretty much all the scenes he was in here. Also Jacob Matschenz and Axel Stein return from part 1.I have to say qualitywise this movie is pretty much on par with the other two films. They do not suck entirely but I am not a fan of either. Here and there there is a good scene like the present scene early on in this one but overall I hoped for more. Reimann is again the lead actor and I still believe the other kids actors were at least as good as he was. Don't see much talent in him. Also I did not like the rap version of the good main theme at all. They used the catchy Amada Mia Amore Mio tune here finally from the original film so I forgive them for that. I cannot forgive them for the whole prison break sequences. They were chaotic and really added anything to the story. I liked however that they did not succeed so there was a major story development change around minute 60. Also why did the kids have to try to get them out and the hospital would not contact the prison simply? Another approach was needed and they found it with the help of Tschirner's character. I believe you should watch the first and then decided if you want to go on. Quality's not getting worse but as I said before that's more because it is a consistently weak trilogy.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most expensive projects of its time  between the 5 million RM of Mnchhausen and 85 million RM of Kolberg  this film is worth its reputation. I do understand that it can be watched without subtitles but having translated this film recently I urge you to find a subtitled version or you'll miss most of its fun. The dialog is very snappy and sometimes even funny. But it's the musical numbers that really are the piece de resistance here building an enormous Agfacolor alternative reality to the world that was devastated by the War. It's reported that the orderly Germans occasionally stampeded the fellow citizens trying to get a ticket  such was the enthusiasm as the film opened in the late summer of 1944. Rkk is not only a brilliant acrobatic dancer and a passable comedienne but also a good singer starting the film in low cabaretlike voice and showing off her soubrette soprano towards the end. She always was on the stout side she probably needed strong muscles to perform her acrobatics but in this film she really looks good and elegant. Highly enjoyable piece of Nazi filmmaking without a trace of propaganda.After the war this film along with many other German musicals was screened as a trophy picture in Moscow and the whole Soviet Union. Ironically the words of Herr Gbbels became true German film would march with the German army anywhere in the World. The army didn't make it the film did. Even more the grand finale really a beautiful piece of filmmaking made it to the syllabus of the course in the Soviet Film Institute where it remained for a long time. In the greatest of all the Russian cult TV serials  The 17 Moments of Spring  there's a lengthy scene where the protagonist the Soviet spy in the Nazi Germany sits his way through this film for the 13th time. The voice over explains that he hated the film but was waiting for the appearance of a secret courier nevertheless the fact that about 3 minutes of the screen time eagerly watched in 1971 by about 200 million people is used to show one of the dance numbers in the finale proves that The Girl Of My Dreams had been firmly established in the collective knowledge of the Soviet citizen one way or another.".

	onyx:emotionText "One of the most expensive projects of its time  between the 5 million RM of Mnchhausen and 85 million RM of Kolberg  this film is worth its reputation. I do understand that it can be watched without subtitles but having translated this film recently I urge you to find a subtitled version or you'll miss most of its fun. The dialog is very snappy and sometimes even funny. But it's the musical numbers that really are the piece de resistance here building an enormous Agfacolor alternative reality to the world that was devastated by the War. It's reported that the orderly Germans occasionally stampeded the fellow citizens trying to get a ticket  such was the enthusiasm as the film opened in the late summer of 1944. Rkk is not only a brilliant acrobatic dancer and a passable comedienne but also a good singer starting the film in low cabaretlike voice and showing off her soubrette soprano towards the end. She always was on the stout side she probably needed strong muscles to perform her acrobatics but in this film she really looks good and elegant. Highly enjoyable piece of Nazi filmmaking without a trace of propaganda.After the war this film along with many other German musicals was screened as a trophy picture in Moscow and the whole Soviet Union. Ironically the words of Herr Gbbels became true German film would march with the German army anywhere in the World. The army didn't make it the film did. Even more the grand finale really a beautiful piece of filmmaking made it to the syllabus of the course in the Soviet Film Institute where it remained for a long time. In the greatest of all the Russian cult TV serials  The 17 Moments of Spring  there's a lengthy scene where the protagonist the Soviet spy in the Nazi Germany sits his way through this film for the 13th time. The voice over explains that he hated the film but was waiting for the appearance of a secret courier nevertheless the fact that about 3 minutes of the screen time eagerly watched in 1971 by about 200 million people is used to show one of the dance numbers in the finale proves that The Girl Of My Dreams had been firmly established in the collective knowledge of the Soviet citizen one way or another.";

	schema:reviewBody "This revuefilm starts appr. 9 minutes and finishes appr. 15 minutes with entertaining revuenumbers but between these the viewer has to deal with an extremely nondescript and  tendentious love story the woman dancer can only be acceptable to the engineer if she becomes the simple German Hausfrau. Moreover Jacoby's direction is nondescript as well as usual. Seeing the difference in style between the revue scenes and other scenes in all his films I always wondered whether he was helped with the revue scenes.Here Marika Rkk dances better and livelier than in her other films she is sometimes really good here not only in the revue scenes but also as the comedienne. The rest of the cast is boring and probably not helped by Jacoby's direction even Grethe Weiser's contribution is poor. Jacob Tiedtke however as the recalcitrant theater visitor has a hilarious bit part.Is already the story tendentious the last revue number is not only of attractive design and with ditto choreography and music but also a political message to top the tendency of the story the revue moves from Germany via Japan Italy and Spain back to Germany! A clear statement indeed.Further the film is noteworthy for its sexual hints of which the most clear one is the reference made to blowing up by the engineer of hill number C. Both the dancer and the engineer study the map on which hill C is situated at the bottom. This is also the film that allegedly outraged Goebbels one of the dresses of Rkk has a dcollet until her navel. Combined with sensual dancing it was too much the dress stayed but the dancing was redone and toned down.".

A remarkable collage of sounds and images! Monstrous  fascinating! Macabre  engrossing! Like watching people pirouette gaily off a cliff. Presented with the support of the Joan S. Constantiner Fund for Jewish and Holocaust Film.The Anthology Films Archive 2nd St.  32nd Ave also had a campy German film festival the same month featuring HEIMAT and 7 other colorful kitschy melodramas! Released in November 1944 DIE FRAU MEINER TRAUME The Woman Of My Dreams was one of Nazi cinema's biggest moneymakers. The public wading through rubble and the conscripted retreating military escaped for a few hours to dream with their eyes open. Hollywood is as much a state of mind as it is as a place and it's brethren the world over churned out product almost as good as America's. This escapist musical comedyromance is no exception adhering closely to the Hollywood formula. I saw this film without dubbing or subtitles and frankly didn't need them. The slim rocky road to love plot took a back seat to the songs and extravagant production numbers. The fact that it basically remakes Mae West's 1936 GO WEST YOUNG MAN makes the tale easy to follow.Blonde goddess Marika Rkk plays Julia Koster a ravishing redheaded musical revue star and her opening number At Night It Isn't Right To Be Alone playing to a packed theater is both an eyepopper and a jawdropper. Julia's a waterfront floozy in black satin skirt redroses and boa feathers who gets thrown around adaggiostyle by dockside thugs. It's not hard to see why these Teutonic gays er guys weren't serving in Hitler's SS as you watch them prance down stone steps in unison. They all hop in a taxi as Julia on the roof jumps in a hatbox and comes out a Gay Nineties belle a la Mae West. In an opulent saloon setting they finish with a flourish as Julia and chorus girls do a risqu cancan. In desperate need of a vacation Julia and her maid rubberfaced comedienne Grethe Weiser duck out on her demanding musical director ...with Julia wearing only a lacy satin teddie highheels and a sable coat. They board a train with the director in hot pursuit and when it stops in the middle of a snowy nowhere Julia steps out for some air. When the train pulls away she's stranded and while making her way to the top of an icy Bavarian peak she's caught in an explosion. An avalanche knocks her unconscious and she's found by Peter an engineer Wolfgang Lukschy and his friend who carry her back to their chalet. Peter and his crew have been dynamiting the surrounding icecaps and they have no idea the lovely young lady they found is Julia Koster the pinup dream girl of every redblooded German male. A screwball battle of the sexes erupts between the diva and the engineer with the friend making three's company. The story gets surprisingly sexy as Julia goes from teddie to men's pajamas and makes a seductive sarong from a shower curtain. She also smokes drinks champagne warbles sweet nothings to Peter and takes a rainbarrel bath. The jig is up when the radio plays Julia Koster's big musical hit and she grabs an accordion to sing it live for the allmale audience. Found by her maid and musical director Julia goes back to the city to star in the revue The Woman Of My Dreams when Peter makes it clear no wife of his will be a musichall revue star. The film's finale is a 15 minute knockout rivaling MGM in recreating Florenz Ziegfeld. A lavish extravaganza that couldn't possibly fit on a theater's stage it takes us all around the Axis world at that time. In white tie and tails a male dreamer sits among columns and stairs as Julia appears as an apparition in diaphanous Greek gown doing a Sally Rand bubble dance for him. When she throws the bubble at him he's transported to Imperial Japan with Julia as an Oriental Princess doing an ersatz Javanese ballet. The dreamer follows his phantom though Palace portals and comes out in sunny Spain. In a daring flamenco dress cut well below the navel Julia dances seductively until the dreamer jumps from the parapets back to the columns and stairs. During intermission Julia and Peter's love dilemma begins to resolve itself and for the revues end's the musical continues with the dreamer envisioning a wedding with his dream goddess. In black tie and tails with his bride in a low cut wedding gown the dreamer waltzes into a surreal heaven through sunshine clouds and chorus girls playing celestial harps. Wow.Ravishing blonde musical sensation Marika Rkk The Third Reich's Betty Grable will take your breath away in garish Agfacolor. The propaganda in the film is minimal and isn't there at all if one prefers to believe it's not only an Aryan but an Alphamale fantasy to possess a gorgeous hausfrau who gives up all for love. DIE FRAU MEINER FRAU can be summed up as rosy optimism for an evil regime with no future.Goebbels must have loved it.UFA film studios Germany's largest and finest spanned the years 1918 1945. The Woman Of My DreamsDIE FRAU MEINER TRAUME was followed in 1945 by the color spectacle KOLBERG an epic film made to urge the German people to fight to the death. With the military in shambles Goebbels requisitioned over 185000 soldiers from the Eastern front as extras. When KOLBERG had it's Berlin premiere on January 30 1945 Hitler's thousand year Reich was exactly 12 years old and already in it's final days.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Frau meiner Trume or The Woman of My Dreams is a German movie from 1944 and if you see this year you maybe already realize that this was made in Nazi Germany. But the Nazi impact here was not too big really even if a similarity with many propaganda films is that this is also a film in color and that's pretty impressive as there are many German films from 2 decades later that are still in blackandwhite. The director and one of the writer of this 95minute movie is Georg Jacoby and this is possibly his most known work. The lead actress is Marika Rkk still fairly famous in Germany today despite all the time that has passed and she is also not associated with Nazi Germany really. Rkk and Jacoby also collaborated on other occasions. Maybe big film buffs will recognize other names in this film as well especially if they are German but Rkk is without a doubt the biggest star here and if there is any memorable aspect about the movie than it is her performance and especially her musical numbers. Yes there is a lot of music in here too besides the somewhat unsuccessful attempts at comedy and the not too memorable romance aspects. The movie dragged on several occasions in my opinion and I personally cannot say I found it relevant whatsoever. It is an awardwinning film yes but not a good one at all in my opinion and even for its time it is nothing special apart from the use of color and Rkk perhaps. It's fine that it is not a propaganda film but this cannot be the main factor in considering it a quality movie. A film also needs to deliver in terms of acting directing and story most of all and especially in terms of the latter it is underwhelming and just not good enough. I give it a thumbsdown. watch something else instead.".

	schema:headline " It IS a dark comedy! And an excellent bad dream...";
	schema:reviewBody "Virtually ignored on it's release barely reviewed in the press I think this is a great film that is misunderstood and unfairly misjudged. This movie is essentially a dark comedy and a bad dream rolled into one. The story based on the novel by Highsmith is absurd of course it's a comedy as all Highsmith's work is essentially darkly humorous come on a stalker who gets stalked by his victim? The director has a very subtle touch and I think this is why so many people watching this film are lost the film doesn't make conventional choices it simply doesn't make it easy on the viewer that's why so many people feel confused by this movie but in my opinion many viewers these days are unable to recognize when a film is interesting doing something different from the norm and this film is doing exactly that. The film has touches of Lynch Cronenberg and the Cohens about it yet refuses to follow any of those directors paths.You could say it is quite old fashioned it relies heavily on mise on scene a lost art today in most films but to label it Hitchcockian is doing the film a great disservice because the label is too easy to apply here and the director I believe is well aware of the obvious comparison and is constantly playing with those notions. This is perhaps more a philosophical thriller than a psychological one and perhaps that is why it doesn't satisfy everyone maybe the film could have benefited from a little more tension but for me it is an intelligent dissection of the dangers of the romantic mind.Robert wants the perfect woman he stares at her through her window as if in a painting but he knows the perfect woman doesn't exist when Jenny invites Robert in the 'real' woman is exposed as being even more nuts than him. Look at what Robert says to Nickie his ex wife at the end 'when I first saw you  you were like a statue then you moved and it was all...downhill from there on in.' He's only happy with the frozen image of a woman I believe both Jenny and Nickie's death are kind of willed by this man in some dark way set in motion by him at the very least the women he loves are more beautiful to him in death as statues than alive. At the end Robert gets what he wishes for to be in the painting the window himself but always alone. Recommended only for those with a wicked sense of humour patience and a sharp intellect.".

	schema:headline " An almost perfect Highsmith adaptation!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Cry of the Owl is a scrupulous adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel with the same title. The novels of miss Highsmith are generally considered as crimenovels but in my opinion they're more like psychological thrillers. Apart from her famous Tom Ripley novels a series with a slightly different approach the rest of her work is set up around pretty much the same theme in every novel a man almost always a man! gets into trouble by a death for which he somehow is or feels responsible either trough accident or by an impulsive act. The rest of the novel is spent on how this man deals with his mounting feelings of guilt and remorse and whether he will turn himself in or get caught or succeed in wiggling himself out of the mess he's caused. The main character is usually a friendly but slightly neurotic pondering kind of guy who means well but seems to make one wrong decision after another. Miss H's novels are also always and rather surprisingly! a bit misogynous women play a dark role they are unreliable to say the least sometimes airheaded or at other times downright conniving and vicious. In many cases they not only are the cause of the initial crime but they enhance the ultimate downfall of the main character.The Cry of the Owl is about a man who's in the middle of a messy divorce and who accidentally witnesses a supposed marital bliss when he peeks through a window in his neighborhood. When the woman catches him spying on her she asks him in and all of a sudden the tables are turned she starts to stalk him and he gets to deal with her jealous dumped boyfriend.This film has much to say for it. It seems to be pretty true to the book I checked the ending with my copy of the novel it almost fits literally! and the typical Highsmithatmosphere is captured flawlessly the slow pace the tentative communications between the protagonists the unglamorous almost dull settings it's all quintessential Highsmith. I very much liked Julia Stiles here she's totally convincing as the subdued but inwardly resolved Jenny who turns the quiet life of recluse Robert upside down. She's lovely and compelling in an unobtrusive way and her acting is great with only few words but a very subtle use of expressions of her beautiful face.On the other side I did have some trouble with Paddy Considine as Robert. Sure he played the dull neurotic passive and slightly cowardly character to perfection. Yet something was amiss. All of miss H's antiheroes have to be handsome in an allAmerican way they have to look and behave like someone's ideal soninlaw. It's partly this contrast between their outward charm and their inward neuroses that's responsible for the troubles they get themselves into. So it should be the same in this story where it's even more important that the main character is a nice and charming guy to make it believable that there's this very sexy and debonair exwife who still lusts after him and that he can have at the same time such an appeal on this pretty Jenny. It's also important for us the audience to have enough reason to sympathize with him. With Considine unfortunately this is rather very hard and his supposed attractiveness is totally unbelievable. He looks old ragged and worn out drags himself around speaks in a slugged drawling voice and more or less looks like an escaped convict the whole movie through. This only fits in the parts where he looses his cool and beats the hell outoff someone but in the rest of the movie it's just not enough in sync with the premise of a charming guy who's soughtafter by two beautiful women.The other main parts are well covered James Gilbert is convincingly menacing as the dumped boyfriend and Caroline Dhavernas is the perfect counterpart to Jenny as the sexually aggressive vindictive but still caring exwife.All in all I compliment director and writer! Jamie Thraves in capturing Highsmith so well on screen where so many others in my opinion have failed in this like the terrible Ripley's game with John Malkovich!. Apart from the casting of Considine this is an excellent movie. I rank it 8 out of 10.".

At times I wanted to grab the hero by the shoulders and give him a shake to snap him out of his apparent lassitude. At that point I realized the movie was working for me I was invested emotionally. Casting stays refreshingly clear of stereotypes with not a pretty boy in sight and direction performances and technical credits are mostly right on the mark.This picture would have done so much better at the box office if it had let the potential audience know that Patricia Highsmith was the author of Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train. For those of us not familiar with Highsmith's work the title The Cry of the Owl is just too far removed from the essence of this film to be a draw.So when you have the opportunity to see this film relax put your feet up and watch the first ten or so minutes. If you fall asleep or find your mind turning towards undone kitchen tasks then get back to Jersey Shore or whatever else gives your entertainment rush. If this film passes the tenminute endurance test you'll find it evolves into 100 minutes of compelling entertainment destined to linger in the dark crannies of your mind for longer than you might expect.".

Julia Stiles which I had seen but was more familiar with her teen movie career was very surprising.

Her performance was great and had me convinced that she was in fact as mysterious and possibly unbalanced as Forster. This film was well directed well acted and had a pace that had me interested and wondering what was going to happen next. It had the feel of a Hitchcock film and is a top notch thriller in my book.

The mood the style the Suspense... The director frigg'n NAILED it. The look the writing the performances were all top notch.I remember when I saw this the first time that I didn't really care for the lead guy too much he was really just SO annoying because he didn't seem to be able to communicate with others at all. VERY frustrating... But as the film progresses you begin to see other sides to him and he is not at all as selfabsorbed and one dimensional as one may have thought.Talk about PSYCHOLOGICAL... I think this is just about as psychological as a Thriller can get unless of course you venture into Horror territory where you have masterful films like 'SESSION 9' for example. The characters are well portrayed. When Julia Styles and Paddy first meet it is amazing I would think that it would be very DIFFICULT to do a scene like that and be CONVINCING enough to draw the audience into the story as much as it did. And then when you first meet Paddy's almost exwife... Talk about a mindbender. You are seeing some absolutely first rate writing directing and acting here let me tell you...Normally speaking very broadly I do not usually care for films like this where happenstance fate or whatEVER draws these innocent people into this web of disaster no matter what they do. BUT... in this case the film is done SO damn well that you truly have NO choice but to ride along gripping your ss the whole time hoping and praying for the best. That is unless you happen to be one of these vacuous reviewers here who are so jaded bored and clueless that they wouldn't know a good film if it went down on them so to speak...Seriously....Bottom line... this is an exceptionally well done film with Suspense and Tension dripping out of every orifice the film's not yours... It will take you and smack you around until you bloody well beg for mercy...".

Robert is divorcing from his manipulative and cynical wife Nickie Grace Caroline Dhavernasin New York and is not interested in another relationship at that moment.

When Robert is shot on the street he is sure that the responsible is Greg but nobody believes in his words.The Cry of the Owl is a melancholic thriller based on a novel of Patricia Highsmith and a remake of a Claude Chabrol's film of 1987 that unfortunately I have not had the chance to see yet. The story is engaging and sad and the performances are topnotch. The beauty of Caroline Dhavernas' eyes and face is impressive and her character Nickie Grace is a real bitch. The jinx of Robert Forrester is credible despite some stupid attitudes. The conclusion is open to interpretations and I Intend to compare with Chabrol's film. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Vo da Coruja The Flight of the Owl".

	schema:reviewBody "THE CRY OF THE OWL is a tense somewhat disjointed story with Kafkaesque overtones 'marked by surreal distortion and a sense of impending danger' had the film been distributed with the information that it taken from a 1962 novel by Patricia Highsmith 'Strangers on a Train' 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and the followup novels with that character etc it would have likely garnered a larger audience. It is a strange psychological thriller that slowly works its way under the viewer's skin. The screenplay was written by director Jamie Thaves who successfully captures Highsmith's extraordinary story. Robert Forrester Paddy Considine is a troubled depressed but decent young man who retreats from the big city and his exwife for the tranquility of a small town in Pennsylvania. For some not obvious reason he begins to night stalk a young woman Jenny Thierolf Julia Stiles gazing in the dark at the apparently happy Jenny alone in her secluded house. Jenny inadvertently befriends Robert despite the fact that Jenny is in a relationship with Greg Wyncoop James Gilbert Greg confronts Robert a fight ensues and Robert flees after saving Greg from drowning in the river. In a twist of circumstances Jenny begins to stalk Robert admitting that she has fallen in love with him but Robert avoids her advances as he is still in the process of an ugly divorce with his wife Nickie Caroline Dhavernas a strange behaving woman who feeds on Robert's lack of self worth. When Greg goes missing Robert becomes the prime suspect. With the police on his case the 'crime' becomes threatening and in typical Highsmith fashion everything twists and turns at the end creating a claustrophobic and irrational series of events until the story ends with some questions answered and others left hanging. The actors are excellent and the cinematography by Luc Montpellier adds to the haunting creepiness of the film. Jeff Daniels' minimal music score underlines the tension. Before watching this film remind your self that you are dealing with Patricia Highsmith's brand of mystery and the film will be more appreciated. Grady Harp".

Robert Forrester Paddy Considine is a troubled depressed but decent young man who retreats from the big city and his exwife for the tranquility of a small town in Pennsylvania. For some not obvious reason he begins to night stalk a young woman Jenny Thierolf Julia Stiles gazing in the dark at the apparently happy Jenny alone in her secluded house. Jenny inadvertently befriends Robert despite the fact that Jenny is in a relationship with Greg Wyncoop James Gilbert Greg confronts Robert a fight ensues and Robert flees after saving Greg from drowning in the river. In a twist of circumstances Jenny begins to stalk Robert admitting that she has fallen in love with him but Robert avoids her advances as he is still in the process of an ugly divorce with his wife Nickie Caroline Dhavernas a strange behaving woman who feeds on Robert's lack of self worth. When Greg goes missing Robert becomes the prime suspect. With the police on his case the 'crime' becomes threatening and in typical Highsmith fashion everything twists and turns at the end creating a claustrophobic and irrational series of events until the story ends with some questions answered and others left hanging. The actors are excellent and the cinematography by Luc Montpellier adds to the haunting creepiness of the film. Jeff Daniels' minimal music score underlines the tension. Before watching this film remind your self that you are dealing with Patricia Highsmith's brand of mystery and the film will be more appreciated. Grady Harp";

Though Paddy Considine did a fairly good job of bringing some life to the film via some decent acting the overall pace and unbelievable plot aspects keep the film on a downward spiral ending in a climax more of a whimper than a bang.Of note is the lackadaisical way in which this adaptation took key elements of the novel and pretty much left them in the book. And as mentioned above the lack of believability in certain scenes ruined the suspension of disbelief of this reviewer.

As the film develops there is plenty of opportunity for writerdirector Jamie Thraves to succumb to a more exploitative approach yet he resists the temptation to do so remaining sensitive to the subject of mental illness depicting a frightening world full of despair melancholy and chaos.However just because the film doesn't go down the obvious crowdpleaser route that's not to say that it isn't a totally engaging and gripping experience. Leads Considine and Stiles give fine perceptive performances and Thraves measured direction is superb building slowly and inexorably to a downbeat ending that seems to have confused many viewers rather than just 'stopping' as has been mentioned in some reviews the film reaches a logical and startling conclusion with Robert considering the possibility that he might actually be the portent of death that Jenny eventually perceived him to be.8.5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for IMDb.".

Not everyone wants to be spoon fed a story.The main question you are asked at the start of the film is why is the main character Robert a seemingly popular friendly man with a good job obsessed with watching Jenny in the window? The film delivers what i think is a very satisfying and intriguing answer by the end. The closing shot also makes the film feel complete.I have read previous reviews of the film and some people have found fault with the plot by saying its not true to life and these events would be unlikely in the real world. I think others may argue against that but really they are missing the point. This is a story with questions embroiled in the human psyche and a plot closer in essence to a Shakespearian tragedy then a true to life story. This is not a 'Imagine if this happened to you film' nor is it a Hollywood thrillerslasher movie with a nice neat ending.The black comedy came from the realisation that the character of Robert despite his past history of mental illness and recently suffering a breakdown was compared to the other characters the most sane.

	schema:reviewBody "'The Cry of the Owl' has a wicked sense of humour. On the surface it may appear as a thriller but it is more of a dark comedy with subtle humour. After all one cannot fail to see the irony in the premise a stalker being stalked by his stalker. Of course once the premise is introduced this oddly absurd movie the story turns into a game of jealousy betrayal and murder.The execution is quite interesting. It has an old fashioned look to it. Most of the visuals are quite photographic. The slightly washed out colour give it a gloomy look reflecting the colourless lives of the characters. Most of the film is seen through Robert's point of view and the twists are surprising.The film is philosophical too. Robert stalks Jenny because she represents the illusion of happiness. However once Jenny invites him in this illusion is shattered and he loses interest in her.

	onyx:emotionText "'The Cry of the Owl' has a wicked sense of humour. On the surface it may appear as a thriller but it is more of a dark comedy with subtle humour. After all one cannot fail to see the irony in the premise a stalker being stalked by his stalker. Of course once the premise is introduced this oddly absurd movie the story turns into a game of jealousy betrayal and murder.The execution is quite interesting. It has an old fashioned look to it. Most of the visuals are quite photographic. The slightly washed out colour give it a gloomy look reflecting the colourless lives of the characters. Most of the film is seen through Robert's point of view and the twists are surprising.The film is philosophical too. Robert stalks Jenny because she represents the illusion of happiness. However once Jenny invites him in this illusion is shattered and he loses interest in her. In a later scene he describes to his wife Nickie that the first time he saw her she was like a beautiful statue and then she moved and it was all downhill. He seems to be more fascinated by an illusion of perfection and is put off by the humanness of people.Jenny on the other hand who is more messed up than Robert thinks it's fate and that they should be together.

The story itself unfolds like a bizarre daydream that follows a 14 year old Erndira as she is plagued by the wind of her misfortune. It is the wind that causes Erndira to burn down her grandmother's lavish villa. Upon seeing the ruin and ashes the Grandmother informs Erndira that it would take a lifetime to back the debt you owe me. And so begins the young girl's life of prostitution. In order to earn back her money the Grandmother sells Erndira to countless men day and night. It is only when Erndira meets angelic Ulysses that her tortured life seemingly begins to change. Perhaps the most brilliant aspect of this movie is the role of the Grandmother played by Irene Papas. She is carried around on a thronelike chair wears grotesquely gaudy dresses and devours cake by the handful all while dispensing cryptic advice to Erndira. The power that the Grandmother has over the life of Erndira is shocking yet morbidly interesting as is she. This strong presence is the reason that her character commands the most attention in the film. Her greed and apparent indestructibleness is quite possibly representative of the many corrupt and powerful organizations and politicians that are present in Latin America and throughout the world.Erndira is a compelling movie to say the least. It is funny yet eerie intriguing yet grotesque and I thought it was amazing. Everything from the sound effects to the costumes work together to create the web of magic realism that dominates the film. If you like slightly dark stories of Latin American culture with a magical twist Erndira should be your first choice.".

	schema:headline " Surreal enigmatic memorable film. One of my alltime favorites.";
	schema:reviewBody "I first rented this film many years ago and was completely enthralled by it. Just recently feeling a strange need to revisit some of the waytoofew films that I've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime I decided to give Erendira another look. And I'm glad I did as I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film.The story is about a teenaged girl Erendira played remarkably by Claudia O'hana  in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder! who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion after which the grandmother played downright hypnotically by Irene Papas forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages. The viewing is at once fascinating and compelling  though inspite of the basic premise which deals with prostitution is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content. The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn  which by the way is in the rough and tumble part of rural Mexico.The film is very atmospheric arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality. It sometimes borders on the bizarre but not to the point of say a David Lynch film. It's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature read the comments from previous viewers below...Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion quiet and melancholy adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting. The cinematography of the rural places many of which are in the desert is quite superb.The film moves at a nice pace neither too fast nor too slow and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it over again just because it makes you want to do that. For me anyway it really is that compelling.Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. Por ejemplo El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba. The world's not as big as I thought  i.e. It's a small world.This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine which upon drinking is immensely satisfying however you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one.".

Just recently feeling a strange need to revisit some of the waytoofew films that I've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime I decided to give Erendira another look. And I'm glad I did as I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film.The story is about a teenaged girl Erendira played remarkably by Claudia O'hana  in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder! who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion after which the grandmother played downright hypnotically by Irene Papas forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages. The viewing is at once fascinating and compelling  though inspite of the basic premise which deals with prostitution is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content. The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn  which by the way is in the rough and tumble part of rural Mexico.The film is very atmospheric arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality. It sometimes borders on the bizarre but not to the point of say a David Lynch film. It's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature read the comments from previous viewers below...Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion quiet and melancholy adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting. The cinematography of the rural places many of which are in the desert is quite superb.The film moves at a nice pace neither too fast nor too slow and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it over again just because it makes you want to do that. For me anyway it really is that compelling.Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. Por ejemplo El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba. The world's not as big as I thought  i.e. It's a small world.This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine which upon drinking is immensely satisfying however you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one.";

It was filmed in northern Mexico somewhere in the relentless badlands of CoahuilaZacatecasSan Luis Potosi. This isn't the Sedonalike DurangoMexico of the John Wayne films but a truly stark and wild place. I have to find the novel now to check on the original location of the story. Like the location this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not for everyone. It is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film.I hadn't actually forgotten this movie it is indelible. Yet over the years I had forgotten of its existence. I know nobody who has seen it had never read of it nor seen any reference to it. Erendira is such an unusual name I'd even forgotten the title. Well I'll be looking to buy a copy now.I have since the above posting become a huge fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so regret not having read him before.Relative to MsMyth's comment below the movie was filmed in Mexico but the author is Colombian and was not commenting on Mexico or Mexican history in any way although Marquez now lives in Mexico for political reasons. This story is universal. I am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library. Liked the movie? You have to read the story and then everything else Garcia Marquz wrote.

But then the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values and decide what is really important to you. The movie is about a lot of things. It is about how the World Bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt that they can never repay. It is about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards mortgage and car payment. It is about trying to save an innocence that maybe we have never really had and maybe we cannot really save. It is about good and evil and about how hard it is sometimes to tell one from the other. It raises a lot of questions but does not give answers. I think sometimes this is good. For this reason this is a film really worth saving and seeing.".

Erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma's house. Her evil grandma played by Irene Papas forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages. The whole town gets a piece of Erendira so to speak. Although the subject matter sounds harsh the film doesn't exploit sexuality. It's done in a mature artistic manner. The film also has some amazing costumes. Some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most are the origami birds that morph into real birds and a golden orange with a diamond in the center.

The result will probably disappoint most mystery fans especially the anticlimatic ending but for others there are things to enjoy here Alain Delon's playful performance as a victim a sexy Senta Berger at the height of her beauty modeling a variety of sixties fashions Henri Decae's lush cinematography and some disorientating drug induced dream sequences.";

Directed by Julian Duvivier who would die in a car accident shortly after this film was made the film stars Alain Delon and Senta Berger.Alain Delon wakes up from a threeweek coma after a car accident and he can't remember anything not even this gorgeous woman who claims to be his wife Christiane Berger. Apparently he is a wealthy businessman named Georges Campo. He is brought to his palatial estate to recover and he's mighty impressed. There's a doctor there Sergio Fantoni and a mysterious servant named Kim Peter Mosbacher.It doesn't take Georges long to become suspicious of the whole setup. His wife won't have sex with him which for me is the most ludicrous part of the film since it's Alain Delon we're talking about. The name Pierre Lagrange keeps going through his head and he comes to believe he's a prisoner in the house and part of some plot. Voices in the night tell him he's going crazy and to kill himself and his dreams are disturbing.The film keeps us in the dark as we wonder about Christiane's weird relationship with the servant and just what the doctor's role is. Despite what you might guess as the film continues it's actually quite intriguing. Both Delon and Berger are at the height of their eyepopping beauty. Delon brings humor to the role as well as playing a confused but determined man. When Chistiane brings a decorator to the house Delon playfully follows him around mimicking the man's gait.Berger looks very sixties with her hair and fashions looking like the ultimate '60s fashion model chosen for her beauty. Today she remains not only a beautiful woman but an incredibly accomplished actress and producer.The end of the movie won't be to everyone's taste. It wasn't mine.There is a lot to enjoy here including the cinematography. In the end it's a disjointed film but watchable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Diabolically Yours uses the same tired old trope that dozens of other films from the 1930s onward have employed a man wakes up in a hospital not sure who he is but suspecting that he's not who everyone says he is. If that man is the film's protagonist we need to develop empathy for him. And the surest way to thwart any empathy is for the plot to make him a fool.Why would a man who began by being suspicious of the story he was being set in and who found more things to be suspicious of at every turn keep reacting in the most foolish and trusting way? In the interest of not giving spoilers let me just say that you or I finding ourselves in his position would've behaved far more sensibly than Alain Delon's character does here. The real fault lies in the plot for simply recycling a predictable story line and requiring stupidity of the hero in order to make it play out.The film does offer two concession prizes some appealing cinematography in the 1960s Eastmancolor process and a cracking jazz score by Franois de Roubaix.".

	onyx:emotionText "Diabolically Yours uses the same tired old trope that dozens of other films from the 1930s onward have employed a man wakes up in a hospital not sure who he is but suspecting that he's not who everyone says he is. If that man is the film's protagonist we need to develop empathy for him. And the surest way to thwart any empathy is for the plot to make him a fool.Why would a man who began by being suspicious of the story he was being set in and who found more things to be suspicious of at every turn keep reacting in the most foolish and trusting way? In the interest of not giving spoilers let me just say that you or I finding ourselves in his position would've behaved far more sensibly than Alain Delon's character does here. The real fault lies in the plot for simply recycling a predictable story line and requiring stupidity of the hero in order to make it play out.The film does offer two concession prizes some appealing cinematography in the 1960s Eastmancolor process and a cracking jazz score by Franois de Roubaix.";

Why take something that was so unique back in 1986 and then remake it in 2010? And to go even further why go from Hong Kong to Korea? Perhaps these are questions not meant to be answered but it does make for an alright action movie. Just don't put this Korean version up against the Cantonese version because that is a bad mistake.If you watch this 2010 version for a standalone action movie then it is a great experience by itself. The story is driven by a good solid storyline though it had a tendency of being a bit jumpy and hard to keep track of who was who unless you pay a very close attentive eye on the movie. And this is what the movie suffers under it is a bit too skittish.This version of the A Better Tomorrow storyline is driven by a heavy dramatic storyline that is focusing on brotherhood and loyalty and that does work out quite well in favor for the movie.Compared to the original trilogy then the 2010 Korean version has less action and shootings in it but it is obvious that they have focused more on the aspects of brotherhood and loyalty rather than just hardboiled action and gunfights.And the movie was well carried by the four actors in the lead roles Jinmo Ju playing Kim Hyeok Seungheon Song playing Yeongchoon Kangwoo Kim playing Kim Cheol and Han Sun Jo playing Tae Min. Thumbs up to these four guys for really adding dimension and character to the 2010 version of A Better Tomorrow.The 2010 Korean version of this 1986 Hong Kong classic is well worth a watch for fans of Asian action cinema. Just keep this version aside from the Hong Kong trilogy and you'll be fine.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Better Tomorrow  for some of us cinephiles the film's name brings to mind images of guys i.e. Chow YunFat in his breakout role and performance that made him a star in Hong Kong in trenchcoats and rayban sunglasses with big friggin guns firing away in blazing battles staged with a balletic precision and melodramatic or just operatic sleight of hand by John Woo. It was a classic unto itself if not as polished as The Killer or as crazy as Hard Boiled with just as much or more genuine heart to its dramatic acting and story. So surprised I was then to see that my local cineplex which often gets Asian films to cater to the the nearby town that is predominantly Korean that 'A Better Tomorrow' would be coming to that theater for a twoweek run. What better way to see Woo's film I thought than on a big screen like one of the ones at my local theater. I was even told perhaps misleadingly to buy a ticket andor concessions that it was the 80's Woo film albeit Korean. Hmm I thought is it Korean? I thought it was from HK like Woo's films usually are but maybe it's dubbed in Korean for the community... hmm...And no lo and behold it was really a remake I can tell this as not an accident as Woo himself is credited here as exec producer. I decided to let the movie speak for itself maybe someone would riff of of Woo's film while putting his own distinct take on the material. Suffice to say it's not anything to write home about. It takes the ingredients of the original story a tale of brothers and betrayal cops and gangsters and a showdown at a big dockshipping yard that last part was the one thing that really stuck out most among set pieces and it's recreated here and just makes it... ordinary. It's a thriller that has a few decent performances I couldn't tell you exactly who as I left before the credits rolled albeit the main gangster villain reminded me of the villain from Oldboy and it's that's the case then very good work there by a proved guy. It has a few flashyviolent scenes. Most memorable for me some time after the movie's end is when a character after shooting up a massage parlor loaded with bad guys and with only a minor wound in his shoulder walks away with sunglasses on trenchcoat on and is trying to look supercool... and then gets shot through the knee and his cool is taken down a peg.But there's not really much to invest in any one character and no actor here is like a Chow YunFat or even a TiLung who were two major assets to the success of Woo's film as real actors with real star appeal. The guys here are workmanlike easy to see how they go through the motions and the director mostly lets the music which even for an Asian crime movie go way over the top to try to direct emotion from the audience when what's there should be enough very stock stuff. If one has never seen the original Woo film I could imagine some perfunctory enjoyment coming from the material but the problem I had and perhaps this is somewhat my fault and happens sometimes with Korean movies was I couldn't keep track of some of the principle characters. I lost track of who was who in the first half hour of the movie and had to be reminded when a character said someone's name. It finally got into a good groove once it flashed forward to three years later and a character with a particular limp is distinctive. But the story doesn't always feel very closely knit together. There's nothing in it that is so offensive as to want to leave the theater. There's also nothing that grabs me in and makes me rush out to tell friends who would perk up at a solid HK or Korean or whatever crime movie with big emotions and bigger gun battles. I can't really speak to the director's past work to draw upon comparison one film by Haesung Song Failan is unavailable in the US though touted by reviewers on IMDb but he doesn't push the material into anything very interesting. It might be commendable that the film doesn't slavishly imitate the original film but then what else is there? Just general competency? A few cool looking characters in a gun battle or some tears shed at just the right flash of the cut of film? A Better Tomorrow 2010 most depressingly does what a good many American remakes do takes the core ingredients gives it a 21st century sheen... and it's generally just dull.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review A Better Tomorrow";
	schema:reviewBody "I wonder if filmmakers and their chosen cast suffer the jitters when they attempt to remake a cult classic trying their best to recreate the formula that worked in another setting and timeline. A Better Tomorrow needs no introduction as it has elements that are deeply entrenched in the minds of any Asian cinephile where John Woo revived the gangster genre in Hong Kong and created a phenomenon inspiring copycats both in film and male fashion.After all who has the ability to recreate the Chow Yun Fat charisma as Mark Gor with his long trenchcoat and aviator sunglasses inspiring a legion of followers to the character so much so that he has to be brought back as twin brother Ken in A Better Tomorrow II? And 70s icon Ti Lung as cochief protagonist around that brought about bona fide gravitas of a man betrayed and finding true brotherhood with his best friend? Then there's the late Leslie Cheung who goes to show that he's not out of place in an actioner and brings out the role of the cocky young adult unwilling to forgive his brother in most excellent terms. And Waise Lee rounding up the quartet as the villain you'd love to hate especially when gloating with one of his last lines.The Korean remake was wrong on a number of counts especially if one were to be a purist and find objectionable character motivations and scenes rearranged with elements tweaked that's as proportionally controversial as A New Hope's Did Han Shoot First?. The basic structure got retained where it introduced the quartet of characters with Kim Hyuk Joo Jin Mo and Kim Chul Kim KangWoo being brothers from North Korea separated when Hyuk abandoned his younger brother to escape to the South hence setting up resentment which serves the crux of the film. Compensating for this brotherly kinship is his good friend Young Choon Son SeungHeon who finds himself going from riches to rags a pale self to his former glory when his revenge didn't go as smooth as he planned it would be.I don't mind that things got changed slightly from counterfeiting to arms smuggling. I don't mind that since this is a Korean remake the plot naturally revolved around North and South tensions amongst the characters. I don't mind too that the characters' overseas romp shifted from Taiwan to Thailand. All these coupled with the updates introduced by director Song HaeSung are pretty minor. The major changes were what irked me since they don't resemble the cult characters they are based on especially that of Kim Chul and his estranged relationship with his brother Kim Hyuk which bordered on thick melodrama that gave an about turn to the latter character when the finale rolled along. There's this obsession with not forgiving his brother yes but things take an inexplicable turn which transformed him from rugged tough guy to wimpy weepy crybaby. What gives?Song SeungHeon perhaps drew the shortest end of the stick because trying to emulate Mark Gor with his YoungChoon was nothing short of a futile attempt unfortunately. Clearly lacking the charisma to pull the role off he tried his best and came up short and in an unceremonious exit I think director Song HaeSung has to bear the blame for some shoddy work here even though we know the original had loopholes in the shoot out department that sort of became terms of endearment with weapons blessed with unlimited supply of bullets that always find their way to embed into bodies of faceless goons these were opportunities that weren't seized to go one leg up before John Woo went balletic with his gun fights and shoot outs.What worked though was how sinister Jo HanSeon played chief villain Jung TaeMin whose meek demeanour hides his sinister nature and becomes the villain you'd love to hate. I thought he did well because he wasn't really trying to live up to what had already been done though perhaps maybe it wasn't as intimidating as trying to fit into the shoes worn by Ti Lung Leslie Cheung or Chow Yun Fat. There's also a distinct lack of female roles here to trip up this gang of four eliminating frivolous romantic subplots where females are nothing but flower vases allowing themes of betrayal friendship brotherhood and camaraderie to ring through much louder.Still this remake is slow to start and it took some 30 minutes before the first major action sequence. To fans of A Better Tomorrow there's nothing here that will surprise you anyway except to raise an eyebrow or two when motivations and subplots deviate. And if there's one more element that this film sorely lacked it's the very very iconic theme tune that accompanied the Hong Kong original. This one pales in comparison and somehow turned out dull for the most parts. You have been warned to stick to the definitive John Woo version.".

But this one looked like an action packed movie a la The Good The Bad and The Weird. Not quite.It was a waste of a time. I wouldn't say it was amateurish in choreography or screenplay I'd say it was terrible in terms of its script. Movie is so annoying unbelievable. Like you know what stupid things one brother might do and he ends up doing all of that. Also script writing is so poor that all these gangsters look more like high school gangsters than real life ones. Tears crying begging pitying each other. A bunch of pathetic girlie gangsters  similarly pathetic movie.410".

	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of John Woo's A Better Tomorrow Trilogy I decided to check this out on a whim and it was better than I thought it would be in summary the plot basically follows the original movie you have the main character Kim Hyuk not as good as Ti Lung and his emotional and fantastic performance as Sung Hoand his best friend Young Choon Mark Lee whilst not as charismatic and cool as Chow Yun Fat's Mark Lee the character is acted and played well and Hyuk's younger brother Chul Not a patch on Leslie Cheung god rest his soul but still well acted Kit rather than counterfeiters the pair are arms traffickers accompanied by newbie Tae Min Shing the difference being between the two brothers is that Hyuk had lost and abandoned Chul at a young age where as Sung Ho and Kit had a great relationship before their father died. And the plot follows on with their relationship and the dodgy deal that leads Hyuk up in prison and by the time he comes out he and his brothers relationship is even more broken as now Chul has joined the Police department and wants to make Detective but because of Hyuk being an excon he loses his promotion and Young Choon is crippled in the leg..the film is slightly longer than the original as this one barely has action sequences more character development but you can't help but already know their characters because of the original movie in some scenes I was playing the original movies soundtrack in those scenes over the new scenes..same as the original movie after Hyuk is out of prison and finds YoungChoon TaeMin is now a high ranking member of the syndicate and is untouchable and YoungChoon wants his revenge but Hyuk is reluctant..The final shootout Just like the original Young Choon grabs evidence that can take down TaeMin and Hyuk and YoungChoon form a plan to take him down then Chul comes in and the shootout begins. What let this movie down in my opinion is that they killed off Hyuk and Chul we saw YoungChoon's death coming but I'm very disappointed they killed off the brothers as I would of liked to have seen a sequel to this movie just like the original ABT2 with YoungChoon's twin brother and Hyuk and Chul but sadly it didn't end like that.Summary Worth watching but the ending truly let's it down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Review This movie seemed like it was never going to end. So much time was wasted on the younger brothers remorse towards his older brother which ended up getting on my nerves after a while and the fact that it didn't have English dubbing also contributed to me falling asleep halfway through the movie. Anyway the film's about a South Korean detective Kim Hyuk Joo JinMo who is also an illegal arms smuggler with his partner in crime Lee YoungChoon Song SeungHeon. Hyuk has a younger brother Chul Kim KangWoo who he left behind with his mother when they defected from the North. After spending time looking for his brother Hyuk eventually finds Chul in a internment camp but Chul resents Hyuk for leaving him behind. When Hyuk finds out that his mother died when he left them behind he's full of guilt and he tries his utmost to get close to his brother again but Chul doesn't want anything to do with him and his criminal activities. Hyuk then goes to Thailand with a new member of there crew Jung TaeMin Jo HanSun but Hyuk he's double crossed by Jung and the Thai gang which leads to a big shootout. Hyuk surrenders to the police and ends up in jail for 3 years and when Lee finds out about the double cross he heads to Thailand to kill the gang leader who had a hand in putting his best friend in jail. During the shootout Lee gets shot in his knee which makes him crippled so with his best friend in jail and Jung in control of the smuggling operation Lee ends up on the streets washing cars. When Hyuk is released from jail he tries to make contact with his brother Chul who is now a police detective but he still has bad feelings towards him. He also makes contact with Lee who wants to get back into the business to take revenge on Jung but Hyuk is determined to go straight. He becomes a taxi driver to convince his brother that he is done with the criminal world but he is constantly pushed by Jung to rejoin the operation. Chul is determined to take down Jung but he hasn't got enough evidence to put him in jail. Jung then severely beats up Lee and he threatens Chul's life so Hyuk puts together a plan to kill Jung. Chul then has a suspicious car crash which has Jung's henchmen written all over it so Lee takes it upon himself to steal some incriminating evidence to stop the feud. They agree to exchange the evidence for a large amount of money so they can escape on a boat but Hyuk has given the evidence to the police and he ends up taking Jung as a hostage so they can escape. When Chul turns up at the exchange the whole situation leads to a massive shootout which also leads to some fatal consequences. I really didn't like the ending of this film and the whole feuding between the brothers concept became very irritating. I really liked Lee's character before he came a cripple and the shootout at the end was realistic. The actors also showed some deep emotion throughout the movie but Hyuk seemed like a lost puppy dog through most of the film. Anyway it's not a bad movie and the storyline is very detailed like a lot of Oriental movies but I was slightly disappointed with the outcome. Watchable!RoundUp This movie was directed by HaeSung Song who has only directed 6 unknown movies in his career and it was written by the great John Woo who also wrote and directed the original A Better Tomorrow with Chow YunFat.Budget 8.7million Worldwide Gross 10.7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their actiondrama movies starring JinMo Ju SeungHeon Song KangWoo Kim and Han Sun Jo. 410".

I saw Rush Hour 3 a few days ago and I have to say that while I was definitely entertained this still didn't feel the same as the previous Rush Hour films. It had great comedy don't get me wrong Chris Tucker is still so much fun to watch on screen. Jackie adds a little more comedic edge to his role this time but it seemed like Jackie and Chris are not clicking as well as they used too. It almost seemed like they were meeting for the first time watching them on screen. Not only that but this movie seemed more rushed and the story wasn't as well developed as the first two Rush Hour films.In the beginning it seems like Lee and Carter are not on good terms Carter seems to have broken off Lee's relationship to his ex girlfriend Isabella. After an assassination attempt on China's Ambassador Lee and Carter are about to face the Triads' China's deadliest gang. They are looking for a list in Paris and Lee and Carter are on the case to find a beautiful woman who might hold the secret. Things get a little more tricky when Lee has to his own brother who is the leader of the Triads'.Rush Hour 3 is all in good fun standing on it's own if this was the first Rush Hour it would have been fine somewhat but just comparing it to the first two films this wasn't as good. But that's just my opinion. But I think if you loved the first two Rush Hour films you should see this it's still a fun film and has great comedy there is a little less action a warning in advance but it's all good if you are looking for a fun film for the end of the summer.610".

While the ambassador is lying in the hospital Detective Carter Chris Tucker and Chief Inspector Lee Jackie Chan promise his daughter that they will catch the man who attempted to assassinate her father. Lee and Carter travel to Paris to save the girl solve the crime and catch the bad guy.The story goes that this film was not released in China because they only can release a certain number of Western films per year and they had reached their quota. Also the other reason they gave for not releasing a film in which China's biggest star appears was that the Chinese censors found Chris Tucker's character offensive. When I heard this I thought it was just another case of political correctness gone mad and it couldn't possibly be that bad. After seeing the movie however I have to agree. I wish it had not been released here either.The movie only runs just under 90 minutes thankfully. The stunts are nothing spectacular and the comedy set pieces are below average. In fact the funniest part of the movie is the blooper reel at the end which would lead me to believe that it is not the fault of the leads that the movie is not really that funny or engaging. The blame should lie firmly at the feet of the writers.With my saying all of this I am sure fans of the series will turn out to see it in droves yet I can't help but think that most will find this the weakest in the series. But don't worry Rush Hour 4 is on its way. I am sure it will be better  well let's face it it couldn't be any worse.".

Unfortunately even though Brett Ratner had six years to direct a Rush Hour 3 it seems as if he didn't use his time wisely. Rush Hour 3 isn't necessarily a horrible film its just void of belly laughs to make up for the disappointment in the weak action story and chemistry. WARNING Best jokes are used up in the trailer. The rest of the jokes have been used in other films or they're just not funny. Its hard to even tell when I was supposed to giggle.Carter and Lee try to solve a case in which a famous ambassador is shot in the chest the moment he is giving a ceremonial speech. Even though the ambassador is guaranteed to live his daughter makes Carter and Lee make a promise that they will catch this criminal who put the ambassador in harm's way. After that it sort of just lost me. But I didn't care I mean come on this is Rush Hour. I came here for the comedy right? Well it turns out that there's a bunch of twist and turns and rituals and mysteries that almost seemed like a supporting genre of the film.The relationship between Lee and his brother is tremendously frustrating. Mainly because his brother is an evil foolish murderer and yet Lee can't accept the fact that killing him would make the future convenient. Throughout the film Lee hesitates to kill him which I know you'll grow tired of as well. But that's not Jackie's only problem. 99 of the film he looks miserable. What happened to the Lee that made an idiot of himself that we saw having a good time yet had the time to perform kickass action? Speaking of action scenes the karate he uses is much more milder and instead of using his fists and legs he's always trying to defend himself with an object and running away instead of going after. Carter is more obnoxious than funny in this film. Just yelling and screaming words but the truth is that just because you amplify your voice doesn't make something funny. There's some plot in here that almost made me feel like I was watching Rush Hour 2 again cause we had that moment where Carter and Lee got mad at each other and become friends again where they judge each other by race and the finale where they fly to the ground from a skyscraper with enemies firing at them. The action sequences aren't anything special story hard to follow and comedy not in the league of the first two Rush Hours. Overall Rush Hour 3 is worthy of a rental. Nothing is worth while on the big screen though. I think people planning to see this would have a much more promising time at Stardust or Superbad.".

There's quite a few decent action scenes and again Chris Tucker's character delivers a lot of the jokes and Jackie Chan's still got the awesome moves and stunts but is it just me or was the action a bit tamer compared to the other two? Not that its much of a problem since I still enjoyed it but just something I noticed. Anyway usual plot including a kidnapping and this time they go to Paris and the two meet up with a person who wants to be like a spy.It was very good and I'm glad the series is still working but perhaps the series should end here. It's hard to tell but usually 3 movies is enough and the first one started like 10 years ago so its a rather large gap. The movie delivered a few laughs some action scenes and for what it was I thought it stayed true to its previous movie structures. I'm glad that Chris and Jackie still work well together but to be honest I think the series should end with this one before it goes overload and loses what made it fun in the first place.".

Highly predictable were as I told the people I was sitting with who was behind it all and who the accomplices were. The movie in a whole is about an hour and twenty minutes. It has pretty humorous parts throughout and some good action scenes but in all honesty they could have been better. The chemistry between the two leads is still there which makes these movies fun in the first place. This was an unneeded yet entertaining entry into the series but it is basically the love child of the first two. The outtakes as usual are the best part of the film. To wrap it up if you enjoyed the first two you will probably enjoy this one as well. Sure you can see everything coming from a mile away but it still makes you laugh and still entertains. Take this for what it is and you will have a good time.".

The jokes were great and I had my shares of laughs and chuckles the only problem I have with the comedy is that sometime they try to stretch it far to much and you're ending up saying We get it already but the comedy succeed quite well. The action scene were always a thrill and the car chase was very fun there was a bit of laughter in the theater.There's a lot more comedy which some jokes were cheesy in this movie than action but in the end I didn't mind I still felt entertained and happy to spend my 15 in this movie.So this is the end of my simple review go watch this movie with low expectation and in a mood for some good laughter and action and you'll enjoy it.

The biggest problem however is the return of somebody from Lee's past with the potential to derail the otherwise stalwart Inspector. Most of this takes place in Paris providing a different setting and a few opportunities to exploit cultural stereotypes that are new to the series. The film is jampacked with the wild mildly provocative humor the series is known for and the silly but entertaining martialarts slapstick that is Mr. Chan's trademark. Chris Tucker gives his best performance in the series delivering a lot of comic punch and playing a nice complement to Chan's sombre and serious Inspector Lee.Rush Hour 3 delivers exactly what fans of the series look for  a simple linear actionthriller liberally decorated with a lot of cleverly written comedy and the amazing physical performance of Jackie Chan. It is better than many of Ratner's recent efforts and a worthy entry in one of the very few comedy series I have enjoyed.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Rush Hour 3";
	schema:reviewBody "Should movies make money then the Hollywood rule of thumb is to make another and another until the franchise runs out of steam. The original Rush Hour was a Jackie Chan vehicle of sorts to break into Hollywood and it made a lot of money with the mispairing opposite Chris Tucker in a buddy cop movie formula filled with action and comedy. Rush Hour 2 was made 3 years later and made even more money but it took 6 years for the second sequel to be made and 9 years for the entire trilogy to be done pray tell will there be another sequel?Is the franchise tired? Probably yet probably not. Face it it's Jackie Chan and most of his films with the exception of missteps such as Around the World in 80 Days make Hollywood studios smile. You can rely on him to deliver the goods in any action comedy but age unfortunately has caught up with him not to mention as well the saferthansafe minimal risks that studios in the West tend to take with its stars. The action sequences in Rush Hour 3 look a bit tired tame and very uninspiring and what Jackie Chan can probably still do has been whittled down to sequences that are just a pale shadow of what could have been.Which leaves us with the comedy thankfully still having its moments especially for those punchlines which deliver. Tucker again gets most of the snarky lines and a target for those politically incorrect jokes while dishing some of his own. If there's any hint of rudimentary character development after these years is that his James Carter besides having been relegated to traffic duties managed to halfchinese himself and no longer is that helpless cop who without his gun can't kick a ball for nuts.The plot is no rocket science and in fact the previous two movies just had something which could coast along from scene to scene providing a platform either to get our heroes Lee Chan and his brotherfromanothermother James Tucker into fisticuffs or provide something for laughs. The first had a kidnapping of a Chinese Consul's daughter which the duo had to investigate in the US while the second brought them to Hong Kong on the trail of a counterfeiting scam. The third pits the detectives against Triads and brings us full circle with the return of that little girl in the original movie who's now all grown up played by Chinese starlet Zhang Jingchu.Zhang Jingchu follows in the footsteps of fellow compatriot Zhang Ziyi who starred in the previous sequel. But unlike Ziyi Jingchu's role is sans martial arts despite her character being a kungfu instructor. It's unfortunately a purely flower vase role though she looks more fleshed and healthier than her druggy role in Protg. Yvan Attal's supporting role as a French cab driver is actually more of a scene stealer  listen out for those jibes at America though it's a little of a cop out how that eventually plays out. Some of the more totally insane moments involve those deliberate lost in translation moments which are the more enjoyable moments in this movie.Rush Hour 3 is similar in structure with its predecessors and it does seem a tad familiar at times in the way the story gets developed with only a change in locale now set in Paris. It's basically an attempt to reunite the two stars in order to make another dent in the box office so though they're back this movie can't be taken all too seriously. It plays out like a cartoon for adults though the local distributor decided to edit portions of the French revue scene to obta in a rating that everyone can go to.If anything stay behind for the outtakes which triumphs over the main offering hands down.".

Plus all of the bad reviews that I read before seeing it didn't exactly make me feel that I was going to be impressed. On the contrary I was surprised by the performances of both Chan and Tucker. The story is fun the characters are interesting the comedy is sharp and the action sequences are well done. It was fun to watch the interplay between Tucker and Chan. Tucker being the outrageous loud and amusing Detective James Carter. And Chan the straightlaced 'good guy' Inspector Lee. The charisma is still there just like it was since the first Rush Hour movie. This one seems to have plenty of more laughs and an even more exiting climax towards the end of the movie than the previous two. I definitely recommend seeing 'Rush Hour 3' for the comedy and action elements and especially for fans of the series like myself.".

The word was that Chris Tucker wanted 20 million and topbilling for his part.It seems that his bargaining worked because instead of a fun summer action movie we got Chris Tucker yelling screaming and zinging everyone in sight with his huge voice and overpowering everyone with his ego.Yes Chris Tucker in this movie was funny. But he was in almost 90 of the movie... and it seemed it was I was watching Chris Tucker The Movie.The plot of this movie is that the Ambassador of the first Rush Hour is shot by a sniper leaving clues that ultimately lead to Paris  where Lee and Carter get mixed up with the Triads and Lee's brother.The plot of this movie is very similar to that of the first Rush Hour movie indeed the Ambassador his daughter and the whole secretive Triad Mafia all make an appearance in both Rush Hour and Rush Hour 3 indeed  the plot twist at the end a plot twist that you can see coming a mile off is even ripped off from the first movie.Asides from the rippedoff plot and Tucker's loud voice Chan is left to do very little there is none of the trademark Chan stunts none of the flashy martial arts  Chan is Tucker's Kato a sidekick to Tucker's movie Asides from a few freerunning parts and a few fight sequences Chan doesn't do very much at all! There is also a heck of a lot of CGI in this movie the parasailing stunt is so obviously CGI enhanced and the fight on the structures of the Effiel Tower..Maybe it was the budget maybe the film was very rushed it certainly felt that way maybe the studio didn't want high octane stunts and wanted it more family friendly... maybe Chan is getting very old and can't do the same stunts that his fans expect from every movie he does  whatever the reason the fact that Chan's role is diminished and reduced is really depressing annoying and frustrating  given that you've paid good movie to see a good action movie.Sometimes I wonder if audiences will get bored of the familysafe action movies such as Die Hard 4.0 and Rush Hour 3... I hope that audiences will demand real action and not this kind of template mess which I feel does not add value to either action or comedy movies.Yes Rush Hour 3 is funny there are some really good sequences but asides from Tucker's loud egomaniac character there is nothing to see in this movie and I would advise you to watch it when it comes available to rent.Overall 310".

	schema:reviewBody "I had seen the previous two Rush Hour films and had loved both of them. The goofy antics of Chris Tucker mixed with the amazing martial arts moves of Jackie Chan made both of the previous Rush Hour films funny and entertaining. Rush Hour 3 is missing both the heart and the feel of the previous Rush Hour films. It is neither enjoyable or believable. It is simply a mess with little humor and is the proof that is needed to show the when a comedy film has a good sequel another attempt shouldn't be made.The plot is rather complicated. Chief Inspector Lee is now the bodyguard of Ambassador Han who is from the first film who is on the way to give a report at the World Criminal Council concerning the Triad crime organization. After and attempt on the Ambassador's life Lee and Carter seek to find out who is responsible. After a cheesy scene where the promise the Ambassador's daughter they will find the men responsible they are off to Paris to investigate. Along the way they meet a strange cab driver a sexy dancer who may have connections with the Triads and a man who may be linked with Lee besides being an enemy.The main problem with Rush Hour 3 is too many things don't make any sense at all. To start it out the plot is a bit hard to understand. Tho whole movie I was waiting for a plot to be revealed to discover by the end nothing had really happened. There are villains that are just added on and mirror images of previous villains particularly the knife throwing girl who reminded me a lot of the girl from Rush Hour 2. Also the main villain is never properly addressed and at the end when Lee and Carter 'save' the day you feel kind of empty inside.Most of the movie did not flow well. There are a few funny scenes but I found the camera turning a bit too many times to Chris Tucker for him to go on one of his now famous rants. There is no character development. Lee and Carter both feel like statues on the screen. Mix that with very poor writing I almost threw up when Jackie Chan was on a swing singing to Chris Tucker I am not lying and you get a poor film. Even the action scenes which the Rush Hour films are known to be good for aren't any good. They are boring and unbelievable to say the least. I found Rush Hour 3 to be a big let down. I rarely laughed. The jokes were too farfetched and unbelievable for my taste. I did like the fight scene on top of the Eiffel Tower but even that got out of hand. Tucker has a few good moments but I am really beginning to wonder what exactly Jackie Chan is considering doing with himself. His parts were some of the cheesiest and most unbelievable parts of the film and I am not talking about his martial arts which there is little of. All in all avoid Rush Hour 3 and pray there is no Rush Hour 4 in the works.25 stars".

There Carter and Lee must find the source of the Triads and it's leader.. Kenji Hiroyuki Sanada who is Lee's long lost brother. Roaming the streets of Paris Carter and Lee then run into a neurotic cab driver named George Yvan Attal who is now part of the chase and becomes their cabbie for this game of cat and mouse. With Carter and Lee now in the city of love watching every angle.. they must put an end to the Triads and rescue Soo Yung.To me Rush Hour 3 was a very good installment I've read some reviews where it's been said that in this movie there seems to be more humor and less action.. well the humor played a key factor in the first and second Rush Hour and I believe for Rush Hour 3 they got it just right. In my opinion expected humor is more funnier than accidental humor but this is Rush Hour and they share both qualities and so saying that Rush Hour 3 was very good and I can't wait for Rush Hour 4....7.510".

The only change is the event takes place in Paris. Other than that this movie seems to be recycled.The story is dead simple. Two buddies Lee Jackie Chan and James Chris tucker go to Paris to find for more clues about the Chinese Triad crew. The story is something like that. And with jokes added.Nothing is impressive. The jokes some of them are the same dirty jokes and fighting scenes Jackie Chan can do better than that. Though it is straightforward and has recycled jokes I still had fun watching it. If only it had great action.If you want to watch a Jackie Chan movie this is harmless for you. It may be fun but you can't expect great action from this. The fight scenes are simple and last for around 5 minutes. It is not very worth to watch it in Cinema unless you have a lot of money to spare. It may be loud at some time but it is just like a comedy with some goofingaction. Unless you like Jackie Chan you can wait for the DVD.".

Initially mentored and supported by a man of the church Hofer soon became the sole leader of the Austrian freedom fighters and a hero among the population. However powerful people in his own country soon used him to further their own political interests. Hofer whose fighting had been motivated by a desire for social justice did not find any support from the Austrian rulers when Napoleon was set on revenge. In 1810 Hofer paid the ultimate price for his bravery and was executed.";

	schema:reviewBody "1809 Andreas Hofer  Die Freiheit des Adlers is a collaboration between Austria Germany and Italy from 2002 so this film has its 15th anniversary this year. The director is Xaver Schwarzenberger and he is mostly known today still for his Otto movies I guess. And probably also for being Rainer Werner Fassbinder's cinematographer decades ago. The writer is Felix Mitterer and huge GermanAustrian film buffs may have come across some other work by him already but there is nothing in his body of work that was really a gigantic success so this film here is certainly a contender for his most known effort. This also has to do with the cast. Moretti Kroetz Gedeck Markovics Krisch Fischer Whler... are all performers who have appeared in many quality movies so it's really a strong ensemble here. And if you see some of these names as well the origins of the writer and director then you may guess correctly that the focus here is entirely on Austria namely on Andreas Hofer who is still today considered among the biggest heroes the country has ever see because of his relentless fight for his country and people and against the oppressors from outside the borders. A fight that he paid for with his life eventually. Looking at Hofer's fame and popularity today centuries later it is really pretty surprising that there are so few films about him really. I believe the reason for that can also be found in this movie. There is no myth  la Stauffenberg surrounding Hofer. It is such a specific complicated subject and while the acting the costumes the sets etc. were all solid if not strong even there was something missing to really get the audience involved in my opinion. You probably need a deep interest in European history preferably Austrian history of the 19th century before watching this movie or it will be as underwhelming and forgettable as it was for me eventually. Little stayed memorable for me here. It was kinda nice to see Moretti and Markovics reunite again for example and there were some scenes at least that had me close to the edge of my seat but from the historic perspective actually the essence of the film I was just never impressed at all. I found it extremely difficult to care for any of the characters in here too and yes that includes the title character. As a consequence the film dragged more than just a bit during its massive 110 minutes running time. Pity. I really wish I could like this more. But I have to give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

Nobody disappointed me. But something is missing in the whole project. Maybe it is a little flaw a little surprise. This biopic is too slick too perfect. There are even too many stars maybe casting Ottfried Fischer as Bavarian king Maximilian was the trigger that lead to me disliking the film there is no space for risks left. Therefore even the cool Tyrolean accent of the characters becomes boring after a couple of minutes.The Andreas Hofer film is a mere commercial project  though admittedly very well done. I would like to mention two of the actors specifically Franz Xaver Kroetz is fascinating as a fundamentalist priest and Julia Stemberger who plays Hofer's wife Anna shows that she can actually act. I still don't like her but at least she managed to impress me in this role.However I don't think this is going to become anyone's favourite movie of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although the famous Nikolai Gogol novel Taras Bulba was filmed many times this version starring Tony Curtis and Yul Brynner is the best known at least in the USA. It's an exciting portrait of 16th century Ukraine under the then powerful kingdom of Poland. What's strangely muted in this version though is the religious angle. The Poles are Roman Catholic and the Ukranians are Russian Orthodox it's a very big part of the reason for the resentments shown here yet we never see the religious beliefs portrayed for either group. Not sure why the script didn't include it.As rulers the Poles hire out the Cossack Ukranians who in today's terminology might be considered a paramilitary outfit to fight off the Ottoman Turks and then turn on them. Yul Brynner as one of the Cossack brigade commanders lops off the right hand of Guy Rolfe the Polish prince in retribution but that hardly satisfies. He goes back to the steppes of the Ukraine and awaits a time for some real payback.In the meantime he fathers two sons Tony Curtis and Perry Lopez who both inherit their father's geopolitical views. Brynner sends them off to school in Poland to learn all the Poles know.While there Curtis falls in love with a Polish princess Christine Kauffman. It's the beginning of his downfall as a Cossack.In his memoirs Tony Curtis says that Yul Brynner was a strangely aloof character with a sort of self imposed grandeur about him in his manner. But that Taras Bulba was a part he was born to play. I certainly can't visualize anyone else in the role including Burt Lancaster who originally had the screen rights then gave them to Tony Curtis when he couldn't do the film. Of course Brynner being in the title role might have had some resentments to being second billed to Curtis but Curtis in fact as a coproducer and he who produces decides billing.Curtis also mentions that on the Argentine pampas location away from American laws the long banned 'flying W' was used in the filming of the battle and charge scenes and many horses were killed. He also mentions that with production overrun costs and accountants ripping him and the film company off what started as a three million dollar film became a nine million dollar film and Taras Bulba in theatrical release barely cleared ten million.However Tony did get a second wife out of the film. Christine Kauffman became the second Mrs. Tony Curtis after the film. Curtis says that Christine did not break him and Janet Leigh up that things were over before he met here still that was the common gossip back in the day.Director J. Lee Thompson made great use of the Argentine pampas standing in for the Ukraine steppes and one does get a feel for the Cossack love of the land the freedom of the wide open spaces. Cossack stories in the Ukraine are just like our American westerns. Those people for all their faults settled and conquered much of what is now Russian Federation.As a bonus Franz Waxman's musical score which did earn Taras Bulba it's only Academy Award nomination is really quite rousing. We get to hear Yul Brynner sing in this film which is a treat a Cossack drinking song. And the love theme for Curtis and Kauffman The Wishing Star is a very beautiful song that Tony Martin put on an album of film songs he did at the time.Ukranian Americans loved this particular film for which I can personally attest. I think others will as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen the reviews here and a couple of comments set Taras Bulba's location in the Argentine pampas. As a native Argentine I must say that's not correct the pampas run all through the middle part of our Country but this film was shot in the Province of Salta way up in the northern part of Argentina some 1400 miles from Buenos Aires the pampas are a huge flat ground very fertile but Salta is uneven with not too high hills cerros very different from the pampas. Another reviewer says Tony Curtis declared once that when he and costar Kristine Kaufmann got mixed up during the filming he was already divorced of Janet Leigh I don't know about that but I can assure you that Leigh came to Salta with him a friend of mine has a photo with her on the cerros. As to the picture I really enjoyed it also because I lived in Salta a couple of years and the landscape is very familiar to me but I think a real classical epic could have come out of Nicolai Gogol's famous novel with a more elaborated script as a reviewer correctly stated here.J. Lee Thompson's product seems sort of cheap and lacks spectacle except for some real good battle scenes although I admit if has some very good moments. A somehow impressive one is when the big doors of the sieged city open slowly and Andr Curtis appears in a frontal close shot wearing a Polish armor and helmet for he will make a run for food too feed the starving citizens inside in a clear treason to his country and father for the love of a woman. Also the final dark atmosphere Thompson achieves when Taras Yul Brynner confronts his favourite son after a treason he can't possibly understand and even less when Andr just explains I did what I had to do. Brynner's performance though a little overacted is good enough and he fills the role of Taras easily. Tony Curtis makes a great effort and gets some good moments as Andr though he clearly lacks the appropriate physic du rol. The rest of the cast gives a good support among them Sam Wanamaker Brad Dexter Guy Rolfe and George MacReady. German actress Kristine Kauffman shows her beauty.All in all Taras Bulba comes out as an entertaining and amusing film in its genre and a decent intent on Gogol's book but no much more than that.".

Yul Brynner is the definitive Cossack in this movie. His swagger and bigger than life persona is the perfect match for Taras. His portrayal is both powerful and moving. Added to that is the fantastic horseback battle scenes on the Steppes. The scenes where the Cossack regiments gather with a rallying cry are awesome. Those alone deserve a 10.The story of Taras Bulba had the potential to be a great historical epic had it focused on Taras' struggle between his love for the Cossack way of life and that for his son. Unfortunately given the box office requirements of the time the studio execs decided to toss in a cheesy love story complete with fuzzy closeups and Tony Curtis with his matineidol hairdo untouched. That just jars you out of the period. According to his biography Brynner worked long and hard to bring the rich character to life but broke down when he saw the final cut. That said this movie still deserves a watch if only to see the magnificent Yul Brynner and the wonderfully choreographed battle sequences.".

	schema:reviewBody "How does one choose between the life of a person you love and your father your family your nation? The moral dilemma presented in Taras Bulba would be a tough sell in any era but particularly in last year of the 50s American Graffitti. Producer Ben Hecht screenwriter and director J. Lee Thompson pull no punches. However one can only wonder how great a film Taras Bulba would have been if directed by say David Lean and the love story expanded. As it stands the movie is wildly uneven. The Kiev sequences tend to bog down the movie while at the same time the romantic scenes play too quickly for dramatic impact. Curtis' well publicized adulterous affair with actress Christine Kaufman certainly didn't help box office and it seems the screen careers of both Curtis and Yul Brynner were permanently damaged as both went into decline after Taras Bulba. Sad and ironical since Curtis recently revealed he was legally separated from wife Janet Leigh for over a year before embarking on Taras Bulba and his liaison with Kaufman and in any event adulterous marriage breakups certainly didn't hurt Liz Taylor. It's all a pity because Taras Bulba is an exciting profound movie the kind we are most used to seeing recently from China Hero House of Flying Daggers Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Director J. Lee Thompson The Guns of Navarone makes excellent use of the widescreen process filling the entire frame with action. I say this seeing only the full screen version since it is clear from what remains there was plenty to fill the screen while key action was wisely staged center screen.Curtis is effective in the difficult role of Andre Taras Bulba's son. However Yul Brynner is phenomenal as Taras Bulba. Too bad he's not on screen more. Christine Kaufman is decorative but her scenes with Curtis are too meager to be truly effective.One hopes a widescreen DVD soon becomes available or at least Turner or ENCORE ACTION shows the movie in letterbox. The version I previewed on FLIX showed some signs of damage. Flawed or not Taras Bulba is well worth an 8 on my scale of 10.".

KalinkaMalinka is NOT Ukrainian song! In general while watching this movie I see a lot of Russianbased influences interesting where and why they came from. In 16th century Russia was unimportant and weak country still bearing heritage of Kyiv Rus' and paying tribute to Golden Horde in order to survive. Hence she has no significant if at all influence on her neighbors. But in movie we see Brynner speak with Russian accent Cossacks sing Russian songs and dancing weird dances this is NOT hopak Ukrainian traditional dance What we see here is yet another example of old Hollywood blockbuster movie made without serious historical research and yes it's really great that today movies are made using totally different approach  instant examples are Gladiator Rome TVseries or With Fire and Sword.All in all movie is good but remember Ukrainians are NOT Russians and in Ukrainian language Zaporostsi is pronounced Zaporozhtsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taras Bulba is directed by J. Lee Thompson and adapted to the screen by Waldo Salt and Karl Tunberg from a story by Nikolai Gogol. It stars Yul Brynner Tony Curtis Christine Kaufmann and Perry Lopez. Out of United Artists it's a DeLuxeEastman ColorPanavision production with the music scored by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Joseph MacDonald.Loosely based on Gogol's short novel story tells of a Cossack uprising against the Polish forces who have taken control of the Ukraine. At the centre of the Cossack army is the leader Taras Brynner and his two sons Andrei Curtis and Ostap Lopez. But when Andrei falls in love with a Polish princess called Natalia Kaufmann it sets the wheels in motion for the Bulba family to crack from within just as the Polish come calling asking for the Cossacks help to defeat the Turkish.While not as epic as the film the troubled back story of the production is big enough to lend one to understand why Taras Bulba is not the grandiose picture the story deserves. Main problem comes with casting particularly that of Curtis as the elder Bulba son. It should have been Burt Lancaster who walked so in came Curtis and a decision was made to put him front and centre of the picture. Thus rendering Brynner's title character to playing second fiddle so much so they really should have called the film Andrei Bulba instead. On his day Curtis could act but he's out of place here playing a Cossack with brain and brawn. Then there was the small matter of Curtis' marriage to Janet Leigh falling apart with Leigh visiting the set falling ill and no doubt noticing the sparks flying between Curtis and his delectable costar Kaufmann. Curtis would say it wasn't the final straw but with him going on to marry Kaufman shortly after his divorce it's hard not to think that it sealed the deal!He's not helped by the writers though who allow the love story subplot between Andrei and Natalia to form the core of the plot. They too Messrs Salt  Tunberg were brought in after historical novelist Howard Fast Spartacus refused to tone down the screenplay. He wanted to include what was an important part of the CossackPole war that of the Cossacks antiSemitic attack on Polish Jews. The makers balked and Salt  Tunberg came in and delivered the Andrei overkill and some rather cheese laden dialogue. Brynner was crushed his biography written by his son Rock reveals that it was a role and film he cared for more than any other he had grand plans for the portrayal but the makers didn't share his view. A shame because what we do get of Brynner is wonderfully exuberant muscular and correctly scene stealing.However when Taras Bulba as a film is good it's real good and thankfully it's never dull even if it's it a bit more jovial in the mid section than it is meant to be. Thompson was a fine director of action and suspense and he gets to flex his muscles here to great effect. Casting aside the cheap shots of dummies and wooden horses being hurled about a couple of times the sight of thousands of men on horseback swarming across the Steppes actual location used was Argentina is spectacular. The battles are fierce violent and gripping while the scenes in the Cossacks camps are joyous as men drink sing test their manhood by doing things like dangling over a bear pit it's all very robust and Vikingesque but entertainingly so. There's even some dashing sword play while quality suspense is eked out during a challenge to the death over a seemingly bottomless gorge.Joseph MacDonald's Panavision photography neatly brings the wide vistas to life aided by the use of Eastman Color which gives off a nice period hue. Waxman delivers a blunderbuss score that's seasoned with Russian vitality while the costume department deserves a mention for their efforts particularly for the Polish army who look dandy men of steel. Yes it's a film of flaws and bad decisions but the good does outweigh the bad in this instance and how nice it is to have the chance to see a little known part of bloody history up there on the screen. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Taras Bulba when it was a theatrical release  then again on TV once...it is one of those films that once seen can never be forgotten. From the thrilling theme music to the haunting love score the musical director proved himself the equal of MGM's Korngold. The visual impact of the sweeping granduer of the Argentine pampas substituting for the Russian Steppes...remember this film was made back when the Communists would not allow Americans behind the Iron Curtain to make decadent Capitalist movies. To my dying day I will never forget those scenes of thousands of Cossacks no CGI...it hadn't been invented yet...there really were 1000's of actors on horseback! charging at full gallop brandishing cavalry sabers  yelling ZAPAROSTI! at the top of their lungs.Tony Curtis would not have been my first choice to cast as the son of a Cossack Chieftain a fine actor but way too skinny. Ahhh...but Yul Brynner...what a magnificent stroke of casting genius! If Brynner wasn't a real Gypsy Prince he should've been. The scene in which Taras must kill his own son for betraying the Cossack Brotherhood to the enemy over the love of a woman is one of the most powerful and sobering on film. The dialogue while perhaps a bit corny to modern teenagers strikes an honest chord with those of us who grew up believing that honor  courage are still something that men should strive to protect...with their lives if necessary. When one of the drunken Cossacks calls Curtis' character a coward precipitating a deadly horse race across a huge crevasse that means certain death to one of them Brynner's wife begs Taras to call off the contest saying It was only a word! Brynner calmly and a bit sadly replies Some words are worth dying over.All in all I rate this film 9 out of 10. If it has one flaw it would be expecting the audience to believe that a wimpy little guy like Tony Curtis could successfully compete in a contest of strength with someone as muscular  solidly built as Yul Brynner. That part really needed someone like Steve Reeves or Gordon Scott...even Aldo Ray would've been a better choice as Taras' son. If you haven't seen this classic movie I urge you to do so as soon as possible...even on late night TV if necessary commercials  all.".

When the Cossacks gather and ride to the Polish city to fight the music is truly great. Having seen the movie over 40 years ago I can still hear the music of the ride to Dubnoi over and over in my head. I find it intoxicating!! Yul Brenner is made for the part of Tarus. I could never see Tony Curtis as a Ukrainian prince and his looks do not fit the part. He is however a Hungarian of Eastern European descent. This is a fun movie that has a great score cinematography and some interesting scenes and performances. The Yul Brenner song is laughable though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taras Bulba is a movie about the Ukrainian Cossacks and not Russian Cossacks! The Ukrainian land was independent and not part of Czarist Russia in the 16th century the time the movie portrays. Taras Bulba shows the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian Cossacks fighting to defend Ukraine form their enemies. My favorite part of the movie was when young Andrij Bulba asks his father Taras Bulba why the Ukrainian Cossacks did not wear armor like the Poles. Taras showed his son a cross around his neck and told his son that that is the Ukrainian Cossacks armor. It is a movie about the best European fighters of that era and is a very fun and exciting movie.".

	schema:headline " So Bad It's Almost Good";
	schema:reviewBody "Like a couple of other reviewers I remember seeing this film as a kid at a riotous Saturday matine. For weeks afterwards we played cossacks even found a ravine in a landfill where I lived in NJ to play out one of the scenes. We were lured into seeing it with a great trailer of cossacks running riot fighting horses galloping about. It looked cool. The absolutely wretched love story that took over most of the film almost triggered a riot in the theater that day.This is one of those epics films that I like to describe as so bad it's almost good. The writing is awful the so called epic scenes tend to be ridiculous a couple of thousand extras might have helped and of course a overly mushy love story is thrown in complete to the soft focus scenes. David Lean could pull off the soft focus over and over in Zhivago but whoever directed this turkey simply made them laughable. And yet. . . I just love Yul. He looks the part of a cossack and he plays the part. Tony in contrast is absurd. I guess he just couldn't shave his head to the traditional cossack style so it get's explained away as adopting the Polish style. The parties though and the riding around. What a kick. When I saw this film again in grad school with my Polish girl friend at my side it triggered our first real fight. I roared over the line put your trust in the sword and the sword in the Pole Freud would have loved that one! and she just freaked. She then announced she would enjoy attending the party as it unfolded on my dorm room TV a thought I found appealing in regards to her but I made a comment that I would be hung before I'd let my as yet hypothetical daughter go to one. That really set the girl friend off with accusations of sexism.In fact this movie and The Vikings finally inspired us to stage a barbarian party a riotous success which is still legend with our friends I won't go into the details but it was great everyone in costume food and drinking horns filled with beer flying about etc.But back to the film. The book is remarkable in fact when I use to teach Russian history it was required reading. It appealed to me not only as the great Ukranian epic but the sci fi author as well a model actually for the great heroic epic fantasies of Howard Lamb DeCamp and others. In contrast the film could actually be a case study in how Hollywood can turn an epic book into smush and then lure kids into seeing it with a great trailer of a bunch of guys riding around.And definitely do not miss Yul singing the Cossack song absolutely hysterical. If you can dig up a few Ukranian friends to sit with you do so and watch them go berserk! It would be like their making a movie in Kiev about George Washington and casting Danny DeVito in the lead building a couple of log cabins out in the middle of the real Ukranian steppes and I've been there and saying its Valley Forge.And yet if it ran again tonight at midnight I know I'd watch it. . .the same way I'd watch a train wreck.A final note. Tony was insane. Janet Leigh was ten times dare I say it? the babe when compared to his costar in this film whom he later married.".

	schema:headline " Book is much better than this film";
	schema:reviewBody "So many years have passed when I read Taras Bulba in Russian. This was by the way the first Gogol's novel I read but I always enjoyed this author. Gogol wrote most of his novels in Russian and some others in Ucranian languages and this Bulba was not Russian as many people believe instead he was Ucranian Cosack. The name Taras was popular in Ucraine but not in Russia and the war between greekorthodox Ucranian and Belorrussian with catholic Poles was nearly eternal. That's why these countries decided to unite themselves so many centuries ago with also orthodox Russia while Poland always looked for partnership with Lithuania. The main differences were religious and only when the dangerous Turks attacked them you could find Poles fighting together with Khokhols Ucranian people. In my opinion this epic film of Taras Bulba is a bit vulgar and not reflecting well the differences between slav people Poles were slavs too. In the film it seems that Cosacks attacked Poles because they just wanted to do it and no mention of invasiveness of Poles at that time in the name of Catholic Church. The sudden return of Bulba's sons from Kiev was a pure invention. They both finished well Polish school and Taras knew the advantages of educating them there but certainly Andrei felt in love with Natasha and finally betrayed his father and his people. Taras was tough with himself and his family but was also intelligent and educated far to be a wild person as it is shown in the film. The film shows too many scenes of drinking and heavily eating by cosacks it is impossible to deny that they did it heavily but it was more civilized and far to be as wild as shown here. May be in the future a more successful remake can be done more similar to the original Gogol's version.".

However the film drops the antisemitism of the originalGogol blames it all on the Jews of course. Being made in 1962 just as the Cold War is getting going the theme seems a bit peculiar. The Cossacks are fighting for their freedom from the devilish Poles. At the time the film was made the real Polish people had suffered horrifying cruelty during WWII at the hands of the Cossacks and their Russian masters and Poland was being absorbed into the Soviet sphere loosing their freedom for the next half century.

It's sad to give a thumbsdown review to a movie that features the late and missed Yul Brynner but hey  I'm a Cossack and I skewer babies for lunch.Taras Bulba offers two attractions exhibitions of burly Cossack manhood and hatred of Poles. The lead singers of the Village People  a cowboy a construction worker a cop  look like little girls in comparison to Taras Bulba's Cossacks.Burly macho Cossacks duel by racing their horses over a widening crack in the earth the first to slip into the crack loses and presumably dies but receives a eulogy worthy of a Burly Cossack. Burly Cossacks walk a plank over a pit of fighting bears while chugging vodka they lift up off the ground a fully grown horse on which sits a fully grown rider they chop off the hand of an evil Polish character they plunge their newborn baby boys into freezing cold streams they lay siege to a city and party down while its citizens die of plague. Cossacks wrestle with their dads kill their loved ones trample their hetmans ignore their wives orgy with Gypsies vault on extemporized trampolines and thunder across the steppes in carefully choreographed ballet that would make Busby Berkeley's heart beat like those prancing horse's hooves and his eyes well up with envy and admiration.With all of that how can this movie suck so bad and be such a painful boring slog to sit through? Direction production set design dialogue nothing works here. Other than Yul Brynner nothing in this movie comes together. Well  the horses are nice.An epic doesn't have to be real  it has to create a conceivable alternate world. In what conceivable alternate world is it possible that Yul Brynner is the biological father of Tony Curtis? You get the picture.Neither Yul Brynner nor Charlton Heston is a believable ancient Egyptian but they are utterly believable as each other's nemesis in The Ten Commandments. Yul Brynner was a real live Russian wild man. When Brynner had lung cancer he continued to do the demanding waltz in the stage production of The King and I. Tony Curtis was Bernard Schwartz of the undying Bronx accent who in fights used to protect his pretty face because he knew it was his fortune. These two are not related on screen they clash as if colliding while walking home from the sets of two different films.Movies can do hate in gripping even if morally bankrupt ways we've known that since Birth of a Nation. But Taras Bulba's hatred of Poles is laughable. Poles here are not dumb Polaks. They are rather snobbish noblemen too effete to fight and sadomasochistic Catholics who order the torture of Cossacks and then kneel before a crucifix as the torture is carried out. The real sadomasochists are the filmmakers who created these scenes and the audience members who receive a pleasurable anticlerical thrill while watching them. The caricature is so twodimensional no matter what twisted thing the movie has the Poles do  eventually they tie a pretty girl to a stake  it's boring. Yeah yeah the viewer wants to scream at the screen. You want me to hate the Poles. Ho hum. Can't you get this lead balloon of a movie off the ground? Who was behind this bomb anyway? Was it a desire on some Hollywood mogul's part to get back at the Poles? But then why cast Cossacks as the heroes given the many populations brutalized by this warrior people including those who suffered under the Cossacks who allied themselves with Hitler? The source material Nikolai Gogol's novel is antiPolish but it is also antiSemitic Jewish characters did not make it into this film version. I don't know the backstory behind this film and the film itself is such a bore I can't bring myself to research the question.".

Direction production set design dialogue nothing works here. Other than Yul Brynner nothing in this movie comes together. Well  the horses are nice.An epic doesn't have to be real  it has to create a conceivable alternate world. In what conceivable alternate world is it possible that Yul Brynner is the biological father of Tony Curtis? You get the picture.Neither Yul Brynner nor Charlton Heston is a believable ancient Egyptian but they are utterly believable as each other's nemesis in The Ten Commandments. Yul Brynner was a real live Russian wild man. When Brynner had lung cancer he continued to do the demanding waltz in the stage production of The King and I. Tony Curtis was Bernard Schwartz of the undying Bronx accent who in fights used to protect his pretty face because he knew it was his fortune. These two are not related on screen they clash as if colliding while walking home from the sets of two different films.Movies can do hate in gripping even if morally bankrupt ways we've known that since Birth of a Nation. But Taras Bulba's hatred of Poles is laughable. Poles here are not dumb Polaks. They are rather snobbish noblemen too effete to fight and sadomasochistic Catholics who order the torture of Cossacks and then kneel before a crucifix as the torture is carried out. The real sadomasochists are the filmmakers who created these scenes and the audience members who receive a pleasurable anticlerical thrill while watching them. The caricature is so twodimensional no matter what twisted thing the movie has the Poles do  eventually they tie a pretty girl to a stake  it's boring. Yeah yeah the viewer wants to scream at the screen. You want me to hate the Poles. Ho hum. Can't you get this lead balloon of a movie off the ground? Who was behind this bomb anyway? Was it a desire on some Hollywood mogul's part to get back at the Poles? But then why cast Cossacks as the heroes given the many populations brutalized by this warrior people including those who suffered under the Cossacks who allied themselves with Hitler? The source material Nikolai Gogol's novel is antiPolish but it is also antiSemitic Jewish characters did not make it into this film version. I don't know the backstory behind this film and the film itself is such a bore I can't bring myself to research the question.";

	schema:reviewBody "What could have been one of the strongest epic films of the early 60's is weakened by the miscasting of Curtis a few studioimposed cuts and some really juvenilelooking matte work in the city scenes. Brynner plays the title character a Cossack warrior fighting against the more civilized Poles who rule over the territory in which he lives the Steppes. For a time the two peoples exist in a sort of peace but eventually the restless and proud Cossacks tire of the oppression they feel from the Poles and a major conflict arises. Unfortunately for Brynner he has shipped his sons off to Kiev in order to educate them in the civilized Polish ways and not only has the education had an affect on one son's Curtis's thinking but Curtis has fallen for a young noblewoman Kaufmann and this later complicates things greatly when the war erupts. Brynner felt more deeply about this role than practically any other in his career including The King of Siam and he immersed himself in it fully. Though he complained about the editing of his performance he is clearly perfect for the part and does an admirable job. He took an extra 100000 to soften the blow of secondbilling to Curtis and it was that casting that throws the film off track. Aside from the fact that Brynner and his oliveskinned wife would hardly have produced a son with poolblue eyes a pompadour and a Brooklyn accent Curtis adopts an acting style that is wildly erratic. Though he clearly tries to bring depth and passion to the serious scenes with middling results he offers a quirky irreverent take during other scenes and this seems both outofplace and cheap in the midst of the serious goingson in the story. Kaufmann only seventeen at the time of filming but already a tenyear veteran of the cinema! is lovely and cries beautifully but that's almost all she is ever given to do. She and Curtis make an attractive and appealing couple but their relationship is never as realistic or as fleshedout as one might hope. They fell in love during the filming and married soon after in reallife. Other notable cast members include a nearly unrecognizable Dexter as Brynner's brother razorthin Rolfe as the chief Polish antagonist MacCready as Kaufmann's stern father and Rust as her handsome but detestable brother. Rust is so mysterious and captivating in his few brief moments that one longs to have seen more of him. His career seems to have been stifled by typecasting as unsympathetic henchmen see Walk on the Wild Side for more of him. A truly marvelous score by Waxman is reminiscent of The Sabre Dance at times. It adds considerably to the film. What hurts is the focus on Curtis over Brynner and the cuts that were made in order to whittle this gigantic story down to a movie that could play three times an evening. Also the sets and backdrops for Kiev look like something more suited to The Student Prince or The Pirate than a serious story like this. A few unfortunate rearprojection shots mar a few of the outdoor riding scenes as well. Though a few changes were made from the source novella the story adheres fairly closely to the original. One thing that stands out here is an unintentional ? homoerotic subtext. Brynner and Curtis can't keep their hands off each other and are often hugging kissing wrestling and even caressing in some scenes! Curtis and his brother sleep in a dormitory with many athleticallybuilt students in skimpy pajama shorts and both gentlemen are stripped and whipped frequently. It's an imperfect film but an interesting one with many virtues many of which have been buried in the bad reviews and lost sands of time. A widescreen DVD would surely grant the movie more attention as it contains massive spectacle with the Argentine Army pitching in to make sure the battle sequences aren't puny looking. There's a lot worse out there in the way of historical epics than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taras Bulba is a film by the prolific J. LeeThompson and comes directly after two of his most fondly remembered films  The Guns Of Navarone and Cape Fear. Sadly Thompson is not able to record his third critical hit in a row with Taras Bulba. While the film has plenty of lively set pieces stirring music by Franz Waxman an enjoyable performance by Yul Brynner and epic widescreen cinematography by Joe MacDonald it falls short in a handful of other departments. There's a romantic subplot written in a manner that makes it seem overripe and soppy. There's a lack of historical and geographical authenticity which is hard to overlook. And apart from Brynner as the titular character too many of the actors are guilty of overexaggerated performances.The Ukrainian Cossacks led by the talismanic Taras Bulba Yul Brynner fight a battle against Turk invaders. They are assisted in their fight by an army of Poles led by Prince Grigory Guy Rolfe. Grigory makes a deal with the Cossacks that if their joint forces win the battle he will reward them by granting them control of the Steppes of Eastern Europe. But once the battle concludes with victory the Poles go back on their word and betray their Cossack allies. The Cossacks retreat into the hills where Taras Bulba contemplates how he will one day have his revenge upon the treacherous Poles. He eventually decides to send his two sons  Andrei Tony Curtis and Ostap Perry Lopez  to a Polish university where it is intended that they learn all there is to know about the ways and customs of their enemy. The plan begins to fall apart when Andrei falls in love with Polish noblewoman Natalia Dubrov Christine Kaufmann. Andrei is torn between his love for Natalia and his devotion to his own people's cause. Later when his son's split loyalties become clear Taras Bulba also finds himself torn between his love for his son and his need to lead the Cossacks against the Poles.Taras Bulba is a film that sounds great when described but the actual article doesn't quite live up to its potential. I've already made clear my feelings about the romantic subplot involving Andrei and Natalia but the overripeness and soppiness that plague these scenes are only half of the problem. For the film to reach the devastating tragic climax it seems to be aiming for Andrei and Natalia's relationship needs to be convincing. We need to feel for them we need to be fully absorbed in their dilemma of loyalties we need to be moved by the terrible ironies that bring the film to its supposedly sad conclusion. But we aren't. Taras Bulba is ten times more effective when concentrating on spectacular action and epicscale battles. For these scenes alone it remains a film well worth watching. But it's those attempts to turn it into a tearjerker  an epic for the softatheart if you like  that simply don't work and pull the film significantly downwards.".

What could have been a national epic was sidelined into a corny love story between the son of Bulba played by Tony Curtis and a Polish princess Kristine Kauffman.Romance between Kauffman the 17year old rising starlet and the very much married Tony Curtis to Janet Leigh was grist for the movie fanzines at the time.

Led by Taras Bulba Brynner they stand toetotoe with the invaders. What could have been a national epic was sidelined into a corny love story between the son of Bulba played by Tony Curtis and a Polish princess Kristine Kauffman.Romance between Kauffman the 17year old rising starlet and the very much married Tony Curtis to Janet Leigh was grist for the movie fanzines at the time. It features the usual overacting of Brynner and the tepid performance of Curtis.";

The separate plot lines of several characters is strategically done to keep audiences from becoming bored and the fact that all plot lines eventually converge or somehow is related to one another makes the audience appreciate the characters even more  as they can watch them grow and develop.Don't be fooled by the first 34 of the film tho  even though the comedy is light and fluffy and when it seems all the characters seem to be overcoming their obstacles the movie manages to rip your heart out with more difficult and unthinkable obstacles that makes you cry out in tears WHY?! Why did THAT have to happen?! In fact the sadness comes roaring at the end full throttle  and it becomes pretty overbearing  you become so emotionally frustrated because it just doesn't seem fair to the characters you've come to know and grow with throughout the movie.The starstudded cast however has incredible chemistry with one another as their emotions appear so genuine and real that you can't help but feel the emotions they experience in their lives. You can feel the puppy love sensation of the girl who is too shy to express herself to the cute boy you feel anguish and depression but also hope for the boy who tries so hard to get his relationship back together with his exgirlfriend you feel the sense of guilt and worry for the girl whose boyfriend has a neckrisking job and you feel the love between a child and hisher mother.What manages to strike the audience at heart is the fact that the characters in the movie become so likable that you can relate yourself to them if you've ever fallen in love but can't find the words to say it if you've ever been emotionally trapped in a selfmade prison and you can't find the strength to break free and if you've been in a situation where you're at the brink of giving up but you still gather up courage in the most unlikely of places.Most importantly this movie reminds us how precious time and life can be  and how jaded humans can become about their loved ones and the fragility of life. It also reminds us that we're human  no one is ever perfect and sometimes life itself isn't fair. Definitely living up to its title Sad Movie is a sad movie indeed. But that shouldn't stop you from appreciating this fine film. I just don't know if it's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. Because each time you watch it nothing better will happen  Give it a shot though  you won't regret it.".

It will definitely make you cry as i did. Although some twists may seem a bit oversentimental but it is still effective.It's like when you are questioning or even complaining it's too sentimental you are crying indeed.

	schema:reviewBody "It's been some time since I've watched a movie with a relative huge ensemble cast think the last was Crash and little did I expect this Korean romance movie to boost the same too with fine acting good comedy and lots of love demonstrated in various ways.There are 4 separate stories in this film and it's difficult for me to judge which of them is superior than the other. Each looked into its niche area and have ample screen time to develop its story though the characters do get intertwined in one another's story with little conscious interaction.The first concerns a firefighter and his girlfriend who works in a TV station as a news translator for the mute. She's waiting for him to propose focused on the rationale that given his dangerous job she likes the idea of him having to think of her to hesitate for a while before jumping into danger. He on the other hand is waiting for that perfect opportunity setting and all before popping the question. Initially I thought that this was the most stable of the relationships until they hit a brick wall in their communications and as usual misunderstanding ensues.Breaking down of communications also happen between the firefighter and his soontobe sisterinlaw but that provided some of the best comedic situations in the movie. She's mute and had her life saved by him but he fell for the sister so don't ask. She works as a Snow White doll in a theme park and gets infatuated with a painter who frequents the same park. However she's slightly disfigured on her face and hides behind the Snow White caricature all the time. I found this to be something that I could relate to being shy yet bold when hiding behind a mask. Given by the audience's reaction this piece probably is the most popular with its identifiable theme of infatuation and the cutesy way in which it got played out.The third story is about a motherson relationship. The mother being a career woman hardly gets to interact with her child and the son misses his mother badly. Until an illness confines her to the hospital bed and they start to bond as motherson would given plenty of communication opportunities. However as the story unfolds it's also the most predictable of the lot. It's touching but not as touching as the motherson relationship in the Japanese movie Be With You last year.The last story and perhaps the saddest of all is between a boy and a girl who've broken up. The girl's stuck in a dead end job and yearns to be rescued by an economically stable guy but the guy's she's in love with or used to be is perpetually stuck in unemployment. When they broke up the circumstances under which it was told to him brought him an entrepreneurial opportunity. He tries to woo back his love and I felt that the ending for this segment was the best in the way it developed with the fine cinematography of reflection and rain.The soundtrack is kept simple with the theme song played over and over again in various situations. But somehow it's strange that the same song when played seemed able to evoke the different emotions the situation wants from you. And that I'd tip my hat off to.Halfway through I thought that it would make a nice Valentine's movie with its bountiful picturesque and heartwarming moments. But by its ending even though events played out is typical of a weepy I'd still recommend it for this season of love for the plain message of not taking a significant other a loved one for granted. Tell them I Love You now.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nobody could ever accuse director Kwon JongGwon of false advertising in the title of this film. But even with the advance warning the viewer is scarcely prepared for the tragic emotional impact of the movie. After the initial credits rolled I found myself mentally girding my emotions for what I anticipated to be two hours of barely heldback tears and defensively crossed arms. But after the first twenty minutes of the film I began to question my expectations and even wonder whether the title was merely hyperbole.The film is a medley of four stories each independent and integral to setting the general mood of happiness and hopefulness that permeates that first three quarters of the movie. There is the brave firefighter played by Jung WooSung who is in love with a sign language interpreter Lim Sujeung who desperately wants him to find a less dangerous job. The sister of the interpreter Shin MinAh is a deaf mute who develops a crush on a handsome young painter Lee KiWoo in the park where she works as a costumed character. The last two stories follow a young son Yeo JinGoo whose mother Yeom JungAh is dying of cancer and a neardowell young man Cha TaeHyun who hatches a creative plan to earn money and win back his girlfriend.All of the stories combine a good dose of humor with their romantic plots. The viewer is taken on a pleasant stroll through the lives of the central characters developing sympathy and really relating to the romantic successes and mishaps of the rather motley cast. By midway through the film the anticipation of any deep sorrow is completely gone but at the same time the title still looms over the ending. I found myself actively hoping that each character would be able to resolve his problems but still knowing that something had to go wrong before long.It is the intensity and utter devastation of the ultimate crises that pick the viewer up and fling him against the wall. There is an expectation that the film will be balanced the sadness will be of an amount commensurate with a romantic comedy. It is in this aspect that Kwon JongGwon brilliantly executes his bait and switch without any warning other than the title itself and whatever clues the suspicious mind might have inferred based on the title the film suddenly goes from sunny skies to hurricane intensity. Not one dream is left unshattered and not one character's expectations are fulfilled.Having said all that I really enjoyed this film. JongGwon's artistic expertise is evident in the details of the movie many of the shots are gorgeously composed and the colors throughout are vibrant and stimulating. And I also view the movie as almost an experiment in emotionthe stories are all simple and basic but it shows that in the hands of a great director the audience can be brought into the story to such extent that the final betrayal feels almost personal. I feel that this is the mark of a successful film because most viewers are so cynical and worldly when it comes to cinema that they often fail to suspend disbelief in emotional terms. This movie causes us to do so and the result is that we are forced to question our own expectationsmust romantic comedies or any other genre follow the typically prescribed formula?".

Sad movie is more of the same.Having 4 stories presented in a sort of Love actually style helps a little even just in providing diversification. The story of the pretty word chosen deliberately young man's quest to paint Snow White is actually not too bad. Snow White here is a mute girl who is also disfigured but not seriously as a result of a fire from which she was rescued. As she works in an amusement park as one of those photosession figures walking around together with the Seven Dwarfs with oversized head gears on she is able to hide her face during most of her work day. The rest of the story is somewhat predictable but nicely put together.The other three stories are banal. Cha Taehyun best remembered from My sassy girl provides most of the comedy element playing a professional breakup announcing messenger until his own girlfriend becomes a client. Another story features the mute girl's elder sister a signlanguage TV announcer and her firefighter boyfriend. If it aims at conveying the constant frustration and pressure of having a romance with with a firefighter it's at best a pale shadow of Ladder 49. As a runofthemill romance it has some passable moments. The motherandson story is contrived and sappy employing a plot element that you see in just about every single Korean melodrama  terminal illness.The problem is really that the movie constitutes entirely of clich. The unimaginative editing deprives it of its only chance of having some life. Not even with the most powerful microscope can you detect a tiniest trace of originality.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well this drama has a very simple basic premise it tells love stories of four couples with their own paths. Though it initially seems everything is OK finally all their stories come into sad endings just as the title indicates 'Sad Movie'. I've been admiring Korean dramas for their fresh and original ideas and this drama is no exception. Though some finds similarity with western movie especially for its multiple storyline it has been quite successful to develop its own distinctive feature strong idea. Most casts are wellknown actors at least in Korea and Asia and it surely delivers they add significant points for this drama with their nearly flawless acting. And one more great music especially for emphasizing the 'sadness' factor in the last part.So why don't I give it a 10? The reason is there should have been more scenes. After finish watching this movie you may wonder if there are missing scenes. Indeed the storyline is well developed and rather easy to follow but quite possibly you need to see this drama more than once or read the spoilers to perfectly understand the whole plot for instance 'how could she become XXXX' or 'how suddenly he XXXX' I don't want to give spoilers so I just write XXXX. This drama would be perfect if produced in a mini series like Winter Sonata but since it was produced as a singleepisode drama through noticeably plays longer than average single episode some scenes were forced to be deleted or never shot where it could leave you clueless for a bit... And with all due respects to Korean cinema and without decreasing my admiration for their brilliant ideas as I stated above this is one problem I've found in most Korean movies I've seen great ideas and storyline but often lack proper and often important scenes to qualify for perfection.Simply said if you like Korean or in general Asian romantic drama and you don't mind the notsogood ending give this one a shot. Despite its flaws it's still worth watching. Not the best Korean movie I've seen so far but it still deserves two thumbs up. It will not waste your time and money. And even if you have to watch it over and over again to fully understand the plot like I've said you will enjoy doing it. Trust me.".

And South Korea really do put out a lot of amazing movies in every genre and Sad Movie aka Saedeu mubi is one of those amazing movies.At first I was a bit puzzled about the title of the movie. And my confusion was heightened as the first twothirds of the movie were romantic comedy and as far from sad as it could be. So I was wondering if director JongKwan Kwon was just using Sad Movie as a sarcastic title for the movie.But then as the last third of the movie started everything just fell into place and boy shall I say that the movie more than lived up to its title. And it is somewhat of a tear jerker.The story follows several couples in their ups and downs in their relationships. And the story of the sick mother and the story with the artist and girl performing in a large costume really hit home with me. Those two stories went straight to my heart.The cast in Sad Movie was amazing a lot of really good talents on the cast ensemble. And they did really good jobs portraying their individual roles and characters under the skillful direction of JongKwan Kwon.Sad Movie is truly a beautiful and fantastic movie that you should take the time to watch regardless of loving South Korean cinema or not. This is a movie that takes you through a lot of various emotions from joy and laughter to sadness and tears.I upped my rating from eight to nine stars out of ten because of the magnificent ending that director JongKwan Kwon managed to put on the screen. This is truly what South Korean cinema is all about.".

And they did really good jobs portraying their individual roles and characters under the skillful direction of JongKwan Kwon.Sad Movie is truly a beautiful and fantastic movie that you should take the time to watch regardless of loving South Korean cinema or not. This is a movie that takes you through a lot of various emotions from joy and laughter to sadness and tears.I upped my rating from eight to nine stars out of ten because of the magnificent ending that director JongKwan Kwon managed to put on the screen. This is truly what South Korean cinema is all about.";

The coordination and contrast between Japanese and Korean is shown in a good fashion. The story moves around a Korean boy who meets a Japanese girl in Kyoto and many events starts to take place between them which seems quite natural. Like many Korean movies it starts with the comic flavor get romantic and becomes very sentimental as the story builds on. The ending is something that everyone like and hope to see. If you are an emotional guy or gal then you may feel a lump in your throat as the movie ends. It also shows a few things about Japanese culture as most of the movie events occur in Kyoto Japan. You may learn a few words of Japanese language and get a good taste it. One may not be impressed by the story as nothing is new in it but its a very good pastime and I am sure you will be entertained and thats what a movie is all about isn't it?".

Eventually they are parted but will fate intervene and bring them back together again? I thought this film one of the most beautifully photographed films I have ever seen. Have you ever seen Japanese director Ozu's classic films? He had in them what is called by movie critics pillow shots moments in his films that add a punctuation to certain scenes focusing on the beauties of nature. This film has some outstandingly beautiful moments just like those but even prettier.The English subtitles were excellent but the film is so beautiful you would not even require any subtitles to enjoy it you are seeing the Language of Love which is universal. The two main actors Junki Lee of Korea and Aoi Miyazaki of Japan are dreamy to look at. They have a gentleness about them that is impossible to see today in the youth of the West a spiritual beauty that shines forth like a full moon on a Spring night.You can buy Virgin Snow on yesasia.com or eBay.

Originally unable to abide by the patience that is needed to develop pottery it is this artistic background that assists Min in becoming better acquainted with the beautiful young woman he happens to meet one day.However art is not what initially brings the two characters together. A number of embarrassingly clumsy moments happen to befall Min over the duration of the film who is immediately portrayed as the kind of individual who aggressively abseils through life with frantic determination his stubbornness occasional immaturity and lacking commonsense continuously getting the better of him and towards the end he can be potentially analyzed as been his own worst enemy.Aoi Miyazaki portrays Nanae the young woman who captures Min's attention. Far more reserved and reasonable revealed to be as soft spoken and gentle as she is prone to shyness Nanae's appreciation of art runs deeper than Min's and helps facilitate his own passion for the subject his new found commitment to his father's work being just one of the many things he strives for in order to garner her attention. On occasion these techniques appear highly impractical and exaggerated. A moment when Min unleashes a series of martial arts techniques originally appears very out of place and is just one example of this.Although language and cultural barriers are often confrontational issues that prohibit two people of alternate ethnicities from becoming close and could be evidenced in Nanae's passion for her culture the friendship between Min and Nanae grows at an incredible pace both characters going to great strides to ensure the relationship may work. The dialogue between their characters is as emotionally sensitive as it is adorable while their onscreen chemistry is just one of the many elements that makes this film such an enjoyable experience. It is the familial situation of the leads however that proves to be one of the factors that keeps them apart which is especially tied to the importance family plays in each of their lives.Min's occasional narration adds his opinion to the story and informs how important Nanae is to him though the lack of continued use of this film technique makes it appear as though the character or the director forgot to implement this nondiegetic production element as often as they could have. On top of this the audience are additionally provided a glimpse of Nanae's life outside of her relationship with Min that is further scaffolded as the story progresses. In turn we discover more about her situation than Min ever does and though he is able to realize there are things troubling her never does he deign to ask.The events that lead to the separation between Min and Nanae are stereotypical of Asian melodrama as is the intensity associated with whether or not a happy ending will actually arrive. With this in mind there is a level of sadness that occupies parts of this film which stems from the commitments the leads promise each other and the fear they might not ever see fruition while the scene in which Nanae confesses her feelings is quite possibly one of the film's most metaphorically powerful and emotionally breathtaking moments.Some very beautiful scenery including snow drifting across the streets of the metropolis and another depicting Nanae alone on the beach are visually stimulating and the accompanying soundtrack helps further flesh out the emotions conveyed over the course of the feature. There are several morale lessons the film attempts to provide its audience about relationships and destiny that ought to be considered. However the most important morale lesson of all might be even if you don't speak Japanese you can still get a date with a cute Japanese girl.".

	schema:reviewBody "Method acting is taken to the extreme in the case of this film's main character Sabzian a reallife person who impersonated a reallife filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf he deeply admired and who is taken to court by a family he has deceived  and has his trial filmed by Abbas Kiarostami. Watching the film I was aware that these events really did occur and that the actors playing these characters were the real people involved the opening credits clue us in when they say appearing as themselves but I did not catch on that the courtroom scenes were real footage  to be honest I'm still not quite sure. That IMDb lists the judge in the credits as judge and not as himself makes me suspect that this is indeed all a reenactment. But whether or not the entire film is a reenactment or only the timeshifting parts with Sabzian and the family at their home are reenacted the moment where Makhmalbaf appears onscreen is a transcendent one as true in spirit as real life which it may indeed be.Kiarostami is a true artist the ideal described by Sabzian in the film one who makes his films to depict the suffering of people. He's one of the few with the power to seem wholly pure  he makes me feel at least in the moment that film's real artists are the ones who aren't mere stylists. They're the ones interested in our hopes our guilts our ambitions our fears. The ones interested in people. And here Sabzian is trying to do something for other people he's symbol of their love for the arts by himself masquerading as a great artist. He's living vicariously through the artist he admires and in doing so  however morally ambiguously  accentuating the most candid aspects of himself. By simply assuming another name he can have people treat his views with respect and in this way the film is a scathing attack on celebrity status and the priority with which we give them. However Kiarostami doesn't let us be satisfied with Sabzian's candor we're never sure where we stand with him and the possibility is that his entire court appearance is another grand performance. With the credits rolling over a frozen image of Sabzian's face and his general persona of a troubled but deeply goodhearted person I was reminded of an adult Antoine Doinel.Kiarostami and Sabzian admit that we're all actors in one way or another from a director to you and me We are the slaves of a mask hiding our true face. If we free ourselves from this the beauty of truth will be ours. This film and Taste of Cherry have got to me on such an intimate and personal level and seem so honest and truthful  sometimes in a seemingly banal way  that I don't know how I can recommend them to others. While I think this is a masterpiece if you expect to be blown away you'll be disappointed. But with artists this open if you're willing to open yourself up too hopefully it can mean as much to you as it does to me. 1010".

	schema:headline " a unique and exceptional movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Not the usual Kiarostami movie this is a half documentary half reenactment by the actual people who were involved! That alone makes it a very unique movie.While the story was unfolding Kiarostami found out about it through a magazine article and as luck would have it he was all geared up to make a movie Pocket Money but he decided to talk the executive producer into making this movie! It's shot in 40 days and all the events that happen after Kiarostami started to make the movie are a documentary and all the events that had happened before are reenacted by the original people after the fact.The movie works much better if one is familiar with Iranian cinema and particularly with Kiarostami and Makhmalbaaf an equally famous some would even say the other Iranian director who is not just the subject of this film but also appears in it as himself! The documentary also gives a rare look inside the typical post revolution Iranian court system. Much of what people know about the Iranian judicial system has to do with high profile political cases which are very different than the overwhelming majority of cases that are about everyday legal problems that would typically not make the international news! In fact when Kiarostami is trying to get the judge's permission to film the court room events the judge tries to convince him to pick another trial something more interesting!something having to do with a much bigger crime! Kiarostami has to explain to the judge that it is this particular case having to do with Makhmalbaaf and cinema that he's interested in! During the actual court proceedings Kiarostami with the judge's approving smiles occasionally interjects and asks for more details and explanations! And some of the finest parts of the movie are the exchanges that take place during the trial between Kiarostami and the accused. When the accused mentions that he has finally realized that he is the traveler a 1974 Kiarostami movie Kiarostami is somewhat caught off guard! Many have suggested that the movie is a profound statement about the loss and the subsequent search for identity by an entire nation after a revolution. To his credit in an interview recorded much later Kiarostami claimed that although he agrees with that interpretation he wasn't aware of it while he was making the movie! It is unusual for a director to pass up an interpretation like that as not having been part of his original vision! artistic integrity like that is truly a rarity but then again that's what makes Kiarostami the unique director that he is and why Kirosawa considered him the finest at his craft! In short not your usual Kiarostami movie yet for my money an absolute treat. Here's a movie that engages the audience completely without a single car chase without a single shot being fired no aliens no UFOs no bad guys no good guys and it goes without saying that no one falls in love let alone sex and cheating and the rest of what makes up 95 of the movies today! Yet without using any of these standard tricks of the trade Kiarostami keeps his audience glued to the screen from the first to the very last frame! At the end I tend to agree with the great Kirosawa. Kiarostami has come pretty close to perfecting his craft!".

They are ordinary Iranian citizens who happened to be involved in a curious incident that aroused the interest of a very talented film director. As an American who is aware of the tension between Iran's government and its vibrant film industry you can't help but to scour this simple story for an ideological message. Is it a protest film? Is it an all is well with Iran film? Well it's not either. It's just a simple and relatively mundane story told by the people who actually lived it.What I got out of it and your mileage may vary is a deep sense that there is something beautiful about seeing a relatively small matter as an event of deep significance one that requires all your attention. There is no larger story that gives meaning to the small events portrayed in the film but the people in it as well as the filmmakers themselves imbue them all with a great seriousness. All of it is done without a hint of parody or ulterior motive.And it's not like Iran didn't have big issues to confront in 1990 as it was rebuilding its society after the brutal war with Iraq. The cheap and obvious thing to do which many foreign movies try is to tell a simple story with a background of an emotionally charged historical time. It's quite beautiful to see this movie avoid that trap. It's not like you'll be moved to tears or something but that's a part of the point! In a way the film's ostensible lack of manipulativeness is so fresh to American eyes that you might find yourself moved on a much deeper level. Well that or you might be totally confused. After all there is no background score to instruct you on how you should be feeling at each instant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blurring the line between what's real  what's reconstructed from scratch CloseUp is truly unique in what it pulls off over the course of its runtime and is an incredibly original meditative  masterly constructed example of experimental filmmaking that offers an interesting glimpse into the psyche of a complicated man while showcasing the power of cinema itself.Set in Iran CloseUp covers the reallife trial of a cinephile who impersonated an acclaimed Iranian filmmaker and successfully conned a wealthy family in Tehran into believing that they would star in his new feature that is until his luck ran out. The plot captures the ensuing trial that's filmed by the crew as it transpires in the courthouse while interspersed within those images are reenactments of the case.Directed by Abbas Kiarostami CloseUp marks my first stint with his works  what instantly caught my attention was the opening credits that showed every cast member to be playing themselves an unusually surprising move. Kiarostami's direction deserves kudos for he manages to erase the line that differentiates reality from fiction by using same individuals who were involved in the reallife scene to reenact the earlier events.What's also striking is that the reconstructed segments retain the raw crude  untainted quality of recorded footage while everything that unfolds in the courthouse is not a result of any rehearsed wordplay. Although the confession of the accused gives us a peek into his complex persona as well as his thought process it also elegantly exposes the existing divide between the rich  the poor in Iranian society.Throughout the trial Kiarostami tries to get the perpetrator's side of the story on the camera and while there are times that make you wonder if he's still staging an act or is being honest some of the things said by him do reflect a bitter truth about the society we live in like when he talks about the love respect  hospitality he received from the family when he pretended to be someone else something he never would've experienced otherwise.It's not that you can't differentiate between what's real  what's reenacted in CloseUp but the way its entire plot is executed it makes you forget that deception  allows you experience it for what it is. Cinematography makes splendid use of the camera which is brilliantly utilised for long unbroken takes hidden recordings fixed smooth pans  fluid movements while Editing cleverly arranges the different segments into one consistently engaging narrative.On an overall scale CloseUp is an expertly crafted docufiction about human identity and captures it in its most natural form. Reallife can be just as full of drama  spices as any story brought to life on a film canvas and both forms inspire one another more often than usual. Although regarded by many to be one of modern cinema's greatest works CloseUp didn't enthral me enough to join that particular crowd but I do admire its uniqueness originality  honesty. Definitely recommended.".

Although the confession of the accused gives us a peek into his complex persona as well as his thought process it also elegantly exposes the existing divide between the rich  the poor in Iranian society.Throughout the trial Kiarostami tries to get the perpetrator's side of the story on the camera and while there are times that make you wonder if he's still staging an act or is being honest some of the things said by him do reflect a bitter truth about the society we live in like when he talks about the love respect  hospitality he received from the family when he pretended to be someone else something he never would've experienced otherwise.It's not that you can't differentiate between what's real  what's reenacted in CloseUp but the way its entire plot is executed it makes you forget that deception  allows you experience it for what it is. Cinematography makes splendid use of the camera which is brilliantly utilised for long unbroken takes hidden recordings fixed smooth pans  fluid movements while Editing cleverly arranges the different segments into one consistently engaging narrative.On an overall scale CloseUp is an expertly crafted docufiction about human identity and captures it in its most natural form. Reallife can be just as full of drama  spices as any story brought to life on a film canvas and both forms inspire one another more often than usual. Although regarded by many to be one of modern cinema's greatest works CloseUp didn't enthral me enough to join that particular crowd but I do admire its uniqueness originality  honesty. Definitely recommended.";

	schema:headline " A little overrated but certainly very good";
	schema:reviewBody "Although probably not one of the greatest and most profound films ever made as many have claimed Abbas Kiarostami's CloseUp is certainly a notable achievement a very interesting and often fascinating film. Either a pseudo or semidocumentary Kiarostami keeps everything very ambiguous. The story is a true one. Hossain Sabzian is unemployed divorced and a pathetic human being. He enjoys the cinema very much and when the chance presents itself he tells an aging woman Mahrokh Ahankhah that he is the famed director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. She and her family had recently enjoyed one of his films and she invites him to dinner. At the Ahankhahs' home he continues his charade and begins to lie about wanting to make a film starring the family using their home as the setting. He searches through their house and the surrounding area and even borrows money from the youngest son. Their relationship continues but soon they are tipped off to the fraud he is committing. They have him arrested and take him to court on fraud charges. Now a good portion of this narrative that I've described is not shown on screen. CloseUp begins with Sabzian's arrest as viewed from the outside. I don't know when else I can do it in this review but I'd like to express my fondness for the two scenes where the camera watches an empty can of spray paint roll down the street. I'm not sure if it's supposed to represent something or not but the camera captures it beautifully as it rolls over top of a couple of dried leaves lifting them up and tossing them mere centimeters in the air.Moving on we watch Abbas Kiarostami ask Sabzian if he can document his trial on film. Of course as a huge film lover he agrees. Most of the film takes place at the trial where Sabzian defends himself and the youngest member of the Ahankhah family prosecutes him. A judge presides. It is never really revealed whether the footage of the trial is real or a recreation. I read up on the film a little and both circumstances are claimed by different reviews. Personally I think it's all a recreation for a couple of different reasons that I don't feel like going over it's not really that important. A couple of times the film goes into flashback. We see Sabzian and Mrs. Ahankhah on the bus. We also see the arrest again but this time from the inside. During the trial Sabzian explains his reasons for impersonating Makhmalbaf which are actually very touching. The film also has some subtle humor and it refrains from making fun of its subject. Questions are raised on the cult of identity and on the power of the cinema. They aren't really fully explored however. I think Kiarostami's biggest problem is his undying faith in his film's utter ambiguity. The idea is interesting and rather successful but it shouldn't be taken as profundity. Other films have explored the documentary genre with as much or more success. Orson Welles' final film F for Fake is a lot more entertaining than CloseUp although it has its flaws as well. The best film like this that I've seen is Victor Erice's masterpiece Dream of Light aka Quince Tree of the Sun which was made a couple of years later. That film left me with more to think about both in its themes and its playfulness with the documentary genre than this one does. However CloseUp as I've said is an achievement not to be scoffed at. 810.".

The film CloseUp reenacts them as close to reality as possible and was made by Iran's most proficient director Abbas Kiarostami using not only Ali Sabzian in the lead but also the family involved in their respective parts. With these given parameters it is clear that we're dealing with much more than a semidocumentary as in the tradition of other works of the New Iranian Wave we become witness of a powerful blending of film and social reality and in this case completely at the heart of the subject matter. The book at the source of the whole ruckus was Makhmalbaf's script of The Cyclist dealing with a man who like Sisyphus is forced to ride a bicycle continuously for a week to help out his sick wife. What others perceive as a crook sees himself as the traveler a reference to one of Kiarostami's very own films  and he has a dream a very unique Iranian one.

For me the most interesting part of the film was the testimony of the man on trial about the motivation for his impersonation. He testifies to the great power he held over this otherwise canny educated family who for some time at least he held in his power by virtue of his assumed identity. One doesn't know whether to applaud his honesty or to castigate him for his crime. This ambivalence towards individuals or regarding charged situations is a hallmark of new wave Iranian cinema of which this film is an excellent representative. 'Close up' is an incredibly simple AND complex film.

I always believe that cinema is influential and it can change you thoughts your beliefs and your life if you be able to perceive half of what the film is all about and what the director is trying to create. It's also great to see that I can influence any one  normal people like Ali Sabzian the main character of this film. He is pretending to be a director and he wants to create a master piece but he didn't knew that while doing this he is effecting other people and their life. If you watched this movie without knowing that the story is based on real events it wont inspires you that much but  the story was real. To some extant we all have a little bit of what Ali Sabzian had in himself but we are afraid of expressing it and he wasn't . and that's why we don't except such people in our society. While watching this film Tyler Durden of fight club was continuously bugging my mind. Edward Norton in that film was another character like Ali Sabzian who is pushing his inner self to such extant where its starts' affecting the lives of others around him. About the ending ....well one could only expect from Abbas Kiarostami for such kind of endings disregarded deeply touched and thought provoking. Once a saying that it's every ones dreams to live every other's life because you are not satisfied with what you are and being a director is what Ali Sabzian chose.

Nemye nazdk CloseUp in English is based on the story of a man who pretended to be filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf and the subsequent trial. The movie tests your attention span with its long scenes and emphasis on dialog.I hadn't known of the story until I watched the movie. Kiarostami's movies often look at people striving towards goals the only other one that I've seen is Taste of Cherry. But beyond the story the movie functions as a look at this turning point in Iran's history. They had just come out of the eightyearlong war with Iraq  when the US UK Israel and USSR had armed Saddam Hussein against the revolutionary government  and Ayatollah Khomeini had just died. Iran remained a mostly isolated state for years afterwards until the US overthrow of Saddam Hussein allowed the Islamic Republic to have a stronger hand in the region.Anyway the movie is worth seeing. Both Kiarostami and Mokhmalbaf play themselves in it. Too bad that we won't see any more Kiarostami movies. This year took him David Bowie Alan Rickman Prince Muhammad Ali Gene Wilder Leonard Cohen Leon Russell and Lupita Tovar. That and the ascendance to the US presidency of an unhinged demagogue make 2016 one crummy year.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Iranian film Nemaye Nazdik was shown in the U.S. with the title CloseUp 1990. It was written and directed by Abbas Kiarostami who also appears in the film.CloseUp is an very unusual movie. It's based upon a real eventa man named Hossain Sabzian convinces a wealthy family that he is Mohsen Makhmalbaf another Iranian filmmaker. Kiarostami recreates the original deception using Sabzian and the family as actors in their own drama. Eventually the film shifts into real time at Sabzian's trial and after. Not only is Kiarostami permitted to film the trial but he's permitted to take part in it! As Kiarostami has said Things that are possible everywhere else are impossible in Iran. Things that are impossible everywhere else are possible in Iran.Kiarostami is a genius and there are many examples of his incredible skill throughout the movie. Often Kiarostami turns his camera on events that are at the periphery of the action rather than at the center. For example in the beginning of the movie a journalist and two policemen travel by taxi to the home of the wealthy family. When they get there there's all kinds of discussion about who should go inside who should stay hidden etc. Finally all three men go into the house where obviously something important is going to happen.Any other director would take his camera into the house to film the action. Not Kiarostami. We're left outside with the taxi driver. The family's gardener has swept cuttings and brush into a pile on the street. The taxi driver leaves his cab to pick through the cuttings in search of flowers. Along with the flowers he finds an empty spray can. He sends it into the street where we watch it roll and bounce downhill. Suddenly you realize There's action going on inside the house and we're not seeing it. However until that dawns on you you've really become interested in whether the can will roll all the way down the street to the bottom or whether it will be hung up on debris or at the curb. Kiarostami is saying to us Many things are happening simultaneously. This is the thing I've chose to show you. Isn't it interesting?The movie wouldn't work if Sabzian weren't such an unusual and fascinating character. Much is made in the movie about why he entered into this deception. He wasn't trying to steal from or cheat the family. He just wanted to fool them which he did.I think his motivation is obvious. Outside the walls of the family's home he's just a poor inconsequential person who is barely managing to get by. Inside the walls he's a wealthy prestigious director. Which would you rather be?We saw the film on DVD and it worked well. It's a fascinating movie. Seek it out and watch it!".

Those early scenes of small talk and casual conversation help to create a certain atmosphere that makes it all seem so real. Even later sequences which are reenactments of earlier events do not appear to be artificial at all I had to keep reminding myself that Kiarostami did not film the original meetings of Hossain Sabzian and the various family members. The irony of this is that Sabzian while pretending to be the famed director Mohsen Makhmalbaf claimed that he was going to put the Ahankahs in a movie... and as a result of this case they did in fact wind up in a movie!The film shows a great deal of compassion toward Sabzian and to everyone else involved for that matter. It is incredible to think that after the trial was over they all agreed to participate in the reenactments of earlier events. I don't like to give a film a 1010 until I've seen it at least a second time so I won't here... but on a rewatch it could well reach that highest rating. 910".

I was intrigued as to how his subtle style could make something that good. While I can't quite call CloseUp as good as certain classics it definitely has some fascinating ideas that have lingered with me. It's a strange film where its power isn't in a punch and its impact sits with you at the same strength. But its power isn't concise images or thoughts but in its mystery. With perhaps more than half of the film reenacted rather than documentary footage it never elaborates which is which and leaves it to interpretation.Some are obvious such as the documentary trial scenes but some lie in the grey area where it's uncertain whether it's genuine or not. But with that question it reveals a larger question  is anything really genuine in front of the camera? What is real and what isn't real? One of the things it doesn't leave a mystery is the idea of the power of the director. It's really moving how its subject commits a crime to pretend to be a director just for the power especially as I'd one day like to become a director. That aspect had a profound effect on me. But then it raises questions about Kiarostami's own role in the film when he's on screen and the power it displays. This is definitely a film that will sit with me for a long time before I make up my mind especially as it asks more questions than gives answers.810".

	schema:headline " Reconciliation Continuation Or A Final Swerve";
	schema:reviewBody "Some films are easy to talk about without spoiling much of what's happening. This isn't one of those. So even with the spoiler tag in place I'll still drive you away here. Spoilers ensue!This film Imamura's A Man Vanishes Ningen jhatsu 1967 and Welles' F for Fake 1973 are the pinnacle of a particular breed of film. I'm not completely satisfied with typifying them under the taxonomy of any particular genre but let's say that these films all share the curiosity for truth and cinema. All of them are constructed in the documentary style all of them pretend and ultimately all of them question their very form.Welles' film might be my personal favourite but Kiarostami takes the ideas furthest. We have a reallife event of which he creates a documentary. He then films the reallife trial but also recreates the events leading to that trial by using the very people involved. This might sound delicious enough an idea but the real meat is in the fact that this wasn't just any crime it was identity theft in which a reallife film buff impersonates as a reallife film director leading the people involved believe he is using them for his new film.Kiarostami's style of filmmaking invites us to believe in what we see especially in the courtroom scenes but even there Sabzian is called out for acting by the son of the family. The film invites us to frame it like that  reality courtroom versus dramatized reality the past incidents but for me the gravitational center of the film is not in the reenactments but in the realtime performance given by Sabzian in the courtroom. These scenes constitute the major part of the film.

	onyx:emotionText "Some films are easy to talk about without spoiling much of what's happening. This isn't one of those. So even with the spoiler tag in place I'll still drive you away here. Spoilers ensue!This film Imamura's A Man Vanishes Ningen jhatsu 1967 and Welles' F for Fake 1973 are the pinnacle of a particular breed of film. I'm not completely satisfied with typifying them under the taxonomy of any particular genre but let's say that these films all share the curiosity for truth and cinema. All of them are constructed in the documentary style all of them pretend and ultimately all of them question their very form.Welles' film might be my personal favourite but Kiarostami takes the ideas furthest. We have a reallife event of which he creates a documentary. He then films the reallife trial but also recreates the events leading to that trial by using the very people involved. This might sound delicious enough an idea but the real meat is in the fact that this wasn't just any crime it was identity theft in which a reallife film buff impersonates as a reallife film director leading the people involved believe he is using them for his new film.Kiarostami's style of filmmaking invites us to believe in what we see especially in the courtroom scenes but even there Sabzian is called out for acting by the son of the family. The film invites us to frame it like that  reality courtroom versus dramatized reality the past incidents but for me the gravitational center of the film is not in the reenactments but in the realtime performance given by Sabzian in the courtroom. These scenes constitute the major part of the film. He acts two roles Makhmalbaf in the reenactments and himself in the courtroom scenes.In the end he is united with the real Makhmalbaf a meeting that succinctly sums up what has been happening you can see it as reconciliation if you like you can see it as continuation or as a final swerve of the narrative as it flips around again to show the intentions of the filmmaker.

This is the ultimate stereotype for women and makes us just look oh so bad.

I know that sounds bad since I'm a girl but how in the heck was I supposed to like these characters?

She's especially obsessed with her baby daughter Milly who is having a hard time in the love department. Daphne takes out an ad on the internet as a mom looking for her daughter's life partner. She meets Jason a promising guy who is stable and a guy Johnny a musician with a psychotic son that she's convinced is a heart breaker. Milly meets them both looking like chance and she has to decide between stable rich Jason or sensitive loving Johnny. You can figure it out from here.Seriously these characters were horrible just first off Daphne just comes off as a possessive and psychotic mom who needs a life so badly because she's living it through her daughter's. Then Milly she's dating and sleeping with these two guys at once and then when she gets busted she's crying and we're supposed to feel bad for her? Why wasn't she just honest with the guys in the first place? The ending was horribly clich'd as a chick flick film and was incredibly disturbing in some moments.

	schema:reviewBody "I LOVE Diane Keaton  Baby Boom is one of my favorite movies of all time. Something's Gotta Give is so great I've seen it twice. That's what I thought I was plunking down my 10.50 for when I went to see this horror of a film.I don't know who to blame more the writers Karen Leigh Hopkins  Jessie Nelson or the director Michael Lehmann. The actors are pretty blameless here in that they have proved themselves in other films and are basically following the vision of the director and saying the words of the writers. The script is repetitious and all over the place. Mom says the same thing over and over again in many scenes as do the daughters.I only laughed twice in the entire film. Which is crazy considering that I am usually a hyena at these movies. One laugh was at ONE of her physical comedy moves which I usually love and I can't even remember where the other laugh came from.First of all it is filled with illogic. People do and say things that make no sense. There is even a scene in which Mandy pushes Diane Keaton out her back door which just happens to be wide open. Who leaves a back door WIDE OPEN? I can understand unlocked if you are in a ridiculously safe neighborhood  but huh??? She takes so long to answer the door any selfrespecting guy or girl would have gone home cooked dinner for himself and eaten it during that time span.I LOVE sex talk I write about sex talk my films are sexy but what the hell was the deal with these women just bursting out in orgasm chat any old time? And with your damn mother? I don't think so. Even if she was hip. Which Diane Keaton was not supposed to be in this film. And speaking of sex ... that's the kind of sex you see on AdultFriendFinders? People making out professionally lit  shot?Um the dresses? Didn't they have a costume designer? We all know D has her own campy style but someone should have stopped her. Those dresses just look plain bad on her. She's a great looking woman with a slim fashionfriendly body and yet she looked like a fool in those crinolinecrazed shirtwaists that spun out so wide she looked like a whirling dervish. She would have been better off in a tux.And then she forces that ugly polka dot dress on her daughter. And it turns out the guy LOVES polka dots. What kinda guy loves polka dots? Is it a fetish or something?The hyperactive kid is obnoxious as hell and there's the one scene where he tells the stupid bus driver joke to Diane who listens very carefully and plays along as he tells the same joke over and over. Then moments later when the daughter arrives he yells out something like I like her. She's the only one who listens to my jokes!Oh and the tasteless scene with the senior citizens in front of whom the musician boyfriend chooses to spout the obligatory you complete me speech. In the middle of it one senior lady says Can you hurry up I have to go to the bathroom. Um why doesn't she just go to the bathroom?And the two senior ladies playing tonsil hockey was unfortunate and out of place. The gag comes out of left field and makes that whole thing seem totally gross which is a disservice to all the older lesbian couples in the world. The audience just groaned. Not something you hope to hear in the middle of a love scene.And this was really weird at some point she picks up a photo of herself holding her daughter as a baby. That's the SAME PHOTO used so importantly in The Family Stone another Keaton film that's REALLY good. What's up with that? Are they that cheap?But the worse crime of all is the director Lehmann's handling of Keaton's performance. She is a wonderful dramatic and comedic actress but this was like putting her into overdrive. It was like somebody doing an overdone impression of Diane Keaton in a satirical comedy sketch. It's a damn shame to take an actor's natural comedic talents and force her to imitate herself. I felt similarly of Meg Ryan who was amazing in Jane Campion's In the Cut in her last couple of films with Nora Ephron. These directors fall in love with these actor's eccentricities as we all do and instead of letting them just happen which makes it so charming they direct the actors into doing these charming things bigger and bigger more and more until they lose their charm completely.Diane please go back to Nancy Meyers who wrote and directed Baby Boom  Something's Gotta Give. She's got your number and the comedic chops to pull it all off.Do yourself a favor don't go see this movie. Why? Because I said so.".

Well there is something wrong with this movie and its definitely the poor acting performances and an even worse script.Diane Keaton gives one of her weakest performances to date. Mandy Moore is cute yet vapid. Lauren Graham is...well like she was just going through the rhythms but not trying to much I don't watch Gilmour Girls so maybe she's always like that? Piper Perabo...maybe she was good but her character was little more than an afterthought and has maybe 5 lines the entire movie. Surprisingly there are some decent performances yet they come from the secondary and tertiary male characters with Gabriel Macht delivering the strongest one.This movie is complete cheese only see it if its free or you hate yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. It is now official. Diane Keaton has reached the parody of herself stage. She has become a caricature of her character. The loopy overthetop 60 yr old female who screams stereotype with each line. It was evident in Something's Gotta Give that she had made the turn but Because I Said So time warps her into the level of folly ... similar to Leslie Nielsen of Naked Gun fame who once was also a respected actor. The difference being Nielsen is at least funny Keaton is purely grating and obnoxious. And enough with the turtle necks and ridiculous wardrobe. No one dresses like that ... especially in L.A. Of course there is more to this movie than Diane Keaton ... wait no there really isn't. The only semblance of a bright spot is the glimpse of potential flashed by Mandy Moore. She really has screen charisma and no longer just looks like a big kid. She has 3 films over the next 18 months so we will see just how she is progressing. Other than that all we get is Gilmore Girls Lauren Graham as the wisest of Keaton's three daughters and Piper Perabo as one of the most nondescript characters of all time. I guess she was cast because she looked decent in underwear for the massage scene.As for the poor guys in this one ... no not us schmucks who actually paid to watch I am talking about the actors. Tom Everett Scott is totally miscast as a workaholic architect. Gabriel Macht A Love Song for Bobby Long has little to do but flash his smile and twinkle his eyes. And Stephen Collins is evidently the new Tom Skerritt. You know the cute older guy in all the chick flicks??? The director of this horrid mess is Michael Lehmann who in the past has delivered such gems as Hudson Hawk Airheads and the torturous 40 Days and 40 Nights. When will Hollywood stop giving this guy money to make this worthless fluff? I am sure this weak nocontent film will make money ... simply because real life mothers and daughters will think they should go see it and laugh that someone's relationship is worse than theirs. I say SAVE YOUR MONEY and rent Terms of Endearment which may be the best movie ever about a mother and daughter's struggles to show their love for each other. Just stay away from this one!".

The narrative gets off to a slow start with on opening sequence that fails to arouse much interest or laughter. Only until a joke is shared between Millie Moore and her mother Keaton about a man's uncircumcised entity does the audience begin laughing. This is fairly representative of the movie's humor. It is consistently funny but only through cheap and superficial jokes and scenarios. At times it even verges on slapstick. However credit must be given to both Moore and Keaton who put out stellar performances. Moore proves her ability to be an actress following initial debut in Saved and will hopefully be able to move past her image as teeniebopper musician. Keaton convincingly portrays an over the top single mother who cannot keep her nose out of her daughters' business. The film will have wide appeal for female audiences as it is about the motherdaughter relationship. But men will also find humor throughout and should not be discouraged to accompany their wives and girlfriends. Note Guys this is a good chance to compromise on seeing a romantic comedy that will not bore or disgust. The film sticks to genre conventions but the comedy aspect of the film veers from typical. The set design and editing are both noteworthy. The film will provide a fun evening for couples old and young at the theater and home.".

The dialogue was trite the relationships between the characters awkward to say the least and the each scene played to only the romantic morons. If you're an intelligent human being don't see this film. It's laughable. Literally. I found myself chuckling at the serious moments. Oh I'm so sad. 9.25 down the drain and only Diane Keaton's annoying voice ringing in my ear for hours afterward to show for it.".

	schema:headline " Because it's not THAT bad ...";
	schema:reviewBody "The bad thing about this movie is that it's nothing the audience hasn't seen before. Lots of directors choose a generic montage of oldfashioned family pictures set to a mellow thematicallycharged song for the opening credits. Lots of romantic comedies include generous dosages of overbearing parents predictable twistsandturns and decor that looks like it came out of the Ikia catalog.Nonetheless 'Because I Said So' is for lack of a better word cute. It's predictable in a way that one expects the characters in slasher movies to die corny in a way that only overbearing mothers meddling in the affairs of their offspring can be. And yet isn't that the reason this genre continues to be popular BECAUSE of the comfort of knowing what's going to happen rather than in spite of it? Nobody went to see Bridget Jones' Diary expecting her NOT to end up with somebody after all.Predictability aside the music was fitting the scenery was attractive  one wonders if somebody on the set was a gifted cake decorator before the film's inception or even because of it  and the mainsupporting cast were all passabletoenergized. Diane Keaton in all of her poof skirts and unnecessarily large heels is just enough playful and neurotic to make the role work  I particularly enjoyed her speech about motherhood being the most difficult form of love. I've enjoyed Mandy Moore's rise to indie film infamy since Saved! more than I did her semigeneric pop starlet days and I thought she did a nice job here. And though this is largely considered a chick flick I do want to point out that any boyfriends brothers husbands etc. who get roped into seeing it may well enjoy the antics of Keaton's character's dog who provides slapsticky yet appreciated comic relief.All in all it's not something I'd probably buy on DVD but as a fun and easy way to spend two hours 'Because I Said So' is worth wading through the clichs.".

	schema:reviewBody "A friend asked me to go see BECAUSE I SAID SO tonight and I was game if only for the fact that I knew NOTHING about the movie. One of the benefits of not having TV that's right! No cable no rabbit ears just a DVD player is not seeing commercials for movies so much so that I'm sick of them even before they arrive in theatres. Of course I've been known to even close my eyes and turn the channel that is when I did have TV if a trailer or commercial came on for a movie that I am really excited about. But the last time I did something like that it was for SLEEPY HOLLOW and after I saw the piece of crap I'd wished that I HAD opened my eyes! But I digress.I suppose I did know something about the movie from the poster. I knew Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore were in it. Two actors that I like. And from the looks of it Diane's the mom and she's kinda bossy. Got that. Whatever. So it was going to be a chick flick romantic comedy. That's cool. As a gay man I don't have as big a problem with chick flicks as much as a straight guy might. Predictably I was a big fan of DEVIL WEARS PRADA. But I'm also a pretty tough critic for romantic comedies ANNIE HALL being the penultimate golden ring to reach for. I'm pretty sure it was the Diane Keaton card that possessed me to spend 11 bucks on this one. Fine. You caught me. Plus Michael Lehmann directed it and HEATHERS is definitely in my top 20 and by far the best high school comedy EVER CLUELESS and FERRIS BULLER running a close behind. Needless to say Diane and Michael I was pretty disappointed. ANNIE HALL or HEATHERS this movie is NOT.Everything started out well enough. Single mom raises three beautiful daughters and lives her lonely life through them marrying the first two in a pre title sequence montage of upper class wedding cake bliss. The hair the clothes the prop husbands who NEVER speak then you would have to pay them. I've been on this train before. I soon realized that the movie was going to be one long string of romantic comedy clichs. And I settled in to enjoy the ride.Mandy is the youngest and unlucky in love. Mom places a personal ad for her without telling her and interviews the guys herself. Cue the ugly guy montage. But one emerges as the perfect guy for her daughter Jason Tom Everett Scott  but a dark horse Johnny Gabriel Macht crashes her interview session.Cheesy montages aside I was still holding out hope of a decent movie going experience. But I totally threw in the towel when Mommy turned a suspicious eye on Johnny and made her best guess on his past by clicking off various clichs about him without even asking. His comeback is Thanks. I love being reduced to a stereotype. I waited for the clever comment from Diane's character calling him on his ANNIE HALL reference but no ... nothing! NOTHING! Can you believe this? A line stolen directly from one of comedy's masterpieces is one thing but not acknowledging the source while an actress FROM THE ORIGINAL MOVIE is in the scene is blatant plagiarism. If Woody Allen were dead he'd be spinning in his grave.In case you don't remember the scene in ANNIE HALL is when Alvy meets Allison the amazing Carol Kane at a political fund raiser and he flirts with her by totally guessing her family's history which he finishes by saying Am I right? and she says No that's great. I love being reduced to a cultural stereotype. Is such a friggin funny scene and this piece of crap movie totally stole it. Diane. How could you let this happen? I won't bore you with descriptions of other scenes. Suffice it to say Mandy is torn between the two hotties and at different parts of the movie has both neither one and then the other and she's all conflicted and stuff. Mommy and daughter fight and make up and of course Mommy finds love too. And just guess where the final scene takes place. That's right! A wedding cake cutting sequence! How hilariously predictable! One last thing though. There's way too many overheard phone conversations and answering machine messages online postings and cell phone confessions in this film. It's become a little pet peeve of mine the cell phone as a plot device. You wonder sometimes what romantic comedies did without cell phones. So many opportunities for instant knowledge of a character in a place other than their homes.Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think there's ONE phone conversation in ANNIE HALL. Wait a sec. There is and it's hilarious. Alvy's broken up with Annie and in bed with Shelly Duvall's character and Annie calls begging for him to come over. He arrives and is dispatched to kill a large spider in Annie's bathroom. After he kills it in one of the movie's most heart wrenching scenes Annie confesses that she misses him and she breaks down crying. Now there's a good reason to use a phone to bring two characters together in a scene. Lately it seems that all phones are used for in movies is to suggest a connection between characters when they are in totally different worlds. Kind of a sad commentary on our modern culture.CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS had some pretty kick ass phone conversations too by the way.But I digress.Long story short don't go see this movie BECAUSE I SAID SO.".

Diane Keaton a mother interferes in her daughter's love life so much that they fix her up with a man.The dialogue is flat and could not be less interesting.Women are incompetent a young woman Mandy Moore wears a bright red lacy slip under a green dress.

	schema:reviewBody "Daphne Wilder Diane Keaton has done fine with her older two daughters Lauren Graham Piper Perabo but when it comes to her youngest the klutzy Milly Mandy Moore she feels she has to get more directly involved with finding her a man. Although she has her sights set on Jason Tom Everett Scott a successful architect Milly herself seems more interested in musician Johnny Gabriel Macht who just so happens to have a single father who is interested in Daphne.Because I Said So is an appalling comedy that completely wastes a fine cast with lame material. I didn't have high expectations to begin with yet I wasn't prepared for something this bad. First of all the screenplay was simply atrocious one of the worst of the year so far. The dialog was ridiculous and bland as was the majority of the characters and story. The characters were mostly all vile people and not one of them resembled an actual person that you have a chance of meeting. The horrible things Daphne did to her daughter just went over the line many times to the point that it wasn't even funny and Mandy Moore was pretty unlikable herself so it was pretty hard to care about these people.When the film wasn't offending my intelligence it was just boring to watch. The actors were all good looking so there is plenty of eye candy but it's all so bland and forgettable. There was no development for some of the supporting characters and Mandy Moore wasn't engaging enough to lead the movie.The acting was shockingly bad although anybody would have problems working with this material. Diane Keaton was just depressing to watch. She was way over the top and so annoying. I hated watching her do this and I firmly believe that she only made this movie for the money. Mandy Moore was pretty entertaining in American Dreamz but here she was just wooden fake and not very interesting. I love Lauren Graham and she gave the best performance by far but she should choose better scripts. Piper Perabo was practically invisible and given nothing to do. Stephen Collins and Tom Everett Scott were both pretty creepy and I don't know how to explain it. Gabriel Macht was okay pretty forgettable . Overall I recommend not checking out this film. It was a waste of time and it wasn't very funny just mean spirited and tedious. Rating 310".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't expecting anything deep or insightful or thought provoking when I went to see this. I was expecting a fantasyhorror movie with dark humor where I could turn off my brain and just enjoy the ride and that was pretty much what I got. I really enjoyed it. It was fun and funny and it was fairly obvious that their tongues were firmly in their cheeks when they made this. I enjoyed the 'Middle Ages meets Steampunk' aspect and thought it was a nice touch that Hansel actually developed the sugar sickness  a.k.a. diabetes  from being forced to eat all that candy as a kid.I enjoyed the brothersister vibe between the two. You don't see a great many brothersister action duos. At least none come immediately to mind. It's always buddiescops or soldiers and if there is a malefemale pairing it's usually romantic. To have the protagonists be siblings was a refreshing twist. They both knew the other could take care of themselves but were still protective and concerned for each other.And as for taking care of themselves hunting witches was never shown as easy.

I was expecting a fantasyhorror movie with dark humor where I could turn off my brain and just enjoy the ride and that was pretty much what I got. I really enjoyed it. It was fun and funny and it was fairly obvious that their tongues were firmly in their cheeks when they made this. I enjoyed the 'Middle Ages meets Steampunk' aspect and thought it was a nice touch that Hansel actually developed the sugar sickness  a.k.a. diabetes  from being forced to eat all that candy as a kid.I enjoyed the brothersister vibe between the two. You don't see a great many brothersister action duos. At least none come immediately to mind. It's always buddiescops or soldiers and if there is a malefemale pairing it's usually romantic.

	schema:headline " Leave the kids at home for this one  this revisionist take on the classic fairy tale is an entertaining blend of horror and humour that is as gory as it is vulgar";
	schema:reviewBody "What you may or may not remember about the Brothers Grimm' story is over and done with in the first ten minutes of writerdirector Tommy Wirkola's revisionist treatment of the classic tale which basically imagines what happens after the happily ever after. And so Wirkola fast forwards the story many years later where he would like us to believe that Hansel Jeremy Renner and Gretel Gemma Arterton have found their calling as witch hunters travelling around from village to village killing the evil ones who kidnap children and rescuing their abductees in the process.One particular such mission brings them to the town of Augsburg where a beautiful blondehaired woman named Mina Pihla Viitala is due to be drowned in front of an angry crowd by the shifty Sheriff Berringer Peter Stormare. The Mayor Rainer Bock is not so fast to pronounce judgment on her for the spate of disappearances and has hired Hansel and Gretel to get to the bottom of it. Seeing no visible signs of sorcery on her Hansel and Gretel free her inadvertently setting themselves on a collision course with the Sheriff.But the bitter Sheriff and his band of hunters are the least of their problems  indeed their most pressing concern is the Grandmother Witch Muriel Famke Janssen and her henchwomen who have been keeping the children they have kidnapped locked up in wait for a much more sinister plot to make them even more powerful. Of course as narrative dictates Muriel's plan would have something to do with Hansel and Gretel's own past as well as their extraordinary ability to be immune from the spells of witches.Savvy viewers will be able to spot the connection once the clues are laid so don't expect a revelatory surprise at the end. That doesn't mean however that this reimagination is predictable instead Wirkola keeps you riveted with a surprisingly effective blend of horror and hilarity often within the very same scene. Case in point? Just before she forces someone to turn a shotgun on himself and splatter his brains onto the wall Muriel comments how the room they are in looks somehow drab and could do with some colour.That same irreverence pervades the entire movie which shouldn't come as a surprise if you paid attention to the opening credits and spotted Will Ferrell and Adam McKay as producers of the movie. Their brand of rude cheeky humour is very much alive in Wirkola's first Englishlanguage feature who had demonstrated through his debut movie lampooning Quentin Tarantino  Kill Buljo  that he is perfectly in tune with their sensibilities. But Wirkola also brings his eye for gore  seen in his sophomore film 'Dead Snow'  to this movie so be prepared for exploding flesh crushed skulls and some particularly nasty decapitations that is good reason why this grownup version of Hansel and Gretel does not carry a kidfriendly rating.Amidst the gore and adult humour Renner and Arterton unfortunately are left with paperthin characters. While Renner pretty much looks dour throughout the movie Arterton seems determined to have fun with her asskicking female heroine of a role and her portrayal of Gretel resembles a Lara Croft for the medieval ages. The scenestealer however is Janssen the former Bond villain once again relishing the opportunity to play against type as the villain and putting in a deliciously over thetop performance as Muriel. Other supporting actors don't make much of an impression  including Thomas Mann a firm Hansel and Gretel devotee who gets some laughs from his fanboy behaviour and eventually sees his wish come true to be a witch hunter like his heroes.And we suspect how much you will end up enjoying this new twist to the classic fairy tale will also depend on your expectations. Compared to the recent spate of fairytaleinspired Hollywood movies like 'Red Riding Hood' or 'Snow White and the Huntsman' it veers most far off from its source material to tell an entirely different story. The result of that novelty is something bloody all right that can also prove to be bloody good fun if you're looking for an adultoriented blend of action adventure fantasy horror and comedy. It might not sound intuitive but this fairy tale is best enjoyed without the kids.www.moviexclusive.com".

After viewing it I can say it's a pretty bad....ass film. It's not a great film but it's ridiculously entertaining and even really funny. There's lots of gore here so people who love endless CGI blood will fall in love with this film.Tommy Wirkola's film adds some more depth to the classic tale from the Grimm Brothers Hansel and Gretel. This story explores their adult lives where of course they would become witch hunters. They usually get the job done but then there is this witch who believes she is the most powerful of all.The acting is good and it seems like everyone had a blast. Jeremy Renner as Hansel was good and the funniest of the siblings. Gemma Arterton is certainly very sexy as Gretel. Peter Stormare makes for a hardnosed chief and Famke Janssen relishes her role as the evil witch.Overall I must admit that I had a blast with Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters. The story is not anywhere to be seen but I wasn't in the mood for any indepth story. I just wanted to see witches die and I think I can say my wish was fulfilled. This is an actionpacked horror film that will take you for a thrilling ride. I rate this film 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw the poster for Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters because it actually puts together my two favorite current movie stars Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton! I liked Gothic interpretations of fairy tales like Snow White and the Huntsman. And I also liked the supernaturalization of historical figures like Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter a lot. This film seems to be a cross of those two types and so is one film I made sure I would watch this once it opened.Hansel and Gretel starts as we all know them from the fairy tale children left by their parents in the woods. They were lured by a house made of candy and was captured by the wicked witch who lived inside. We all know how the tale ends when Hansel and Gretel push the witch into the oven. But that was just the beginning of the movie for that was when this brothersister team launch their career as mercenary witch hunters. When a mysterious series of missing children terrorizes a small town its mayor hires Hansel and Gretel to look for the witches responsible and kill them.That was one shallow story line I know but I really enjoyed myself while watching this movie. Yes the gore factor was really high but everything appeared to be done with tongue strictly in cheek. The actors Renner and Arteron are unquestionable badass! They fit the titular roles very well. You will meet a new more interesting Edward here. The CG and production design were quite good and imaginative. It was fun to spot traditional witch lore in the scenes even as they took liberties to invent their own lore.As I mentioned the film does not shy from bloody violence as the envelope is pushed to graphically show various mechanisms of death from crushing to exploding  closeup! There was a brief scene of a nude village beauty Mina Pihla Viitala as she seduces Hansel. There were even unexpected modernday swear words during the witch battles. With all of these scenes I do not really know how it got a PG13 rating in this country! Anyway despite and maybe because of all these surprises I found the whole film a lot of grownup fun a very entertaining one and half hours.After the movie I found out that the director was Tommy Wirkola the same guy who directed the Norwegian Nazi zombies in the snow movie Dead Snow. So that is why his strange Tarantinoesque sense of humor is all over this film. I am a fan! I will be awaiting his next project. However for all the fun I had watching this film though I think they should be happy with what they have now. I think a HG sequel would already be pushing their luck.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a little strange why this film wasn't given advanced press previews in the US and for territories like ours there was a review embargo to comply with signalling the lack of confidence the filmmakers and distributors have on this film update of the Hansel and Gretel storyline. Perhaps they're taking a leaf out of recent updates to fairy tales such as the two Snow White movies and Red Riding Hood that they want to be a bit deaf to criticisms and to allow audiences to judge instead. But Hansel and Gretel as witch hunters followed the mold of Blade and proved to be quite the mass market entertainer with no pretences in wanting to be more.Written and directed by Norwegian Tommy Wirkola this story had all the right ingredients for the kind of film it wanted to be taking the familiar folk lore and putting a creative not necessarily new spin on it. We see how the two kids get brought out to the woods only this time there isn't a trail of crumbs to follow home. The iconic house of bread and sweets and the wicked witch who wants to fatten Hansel as food later on are all included as do their defeat of the witch by burning her alive in the stove. This forms the prologue and the What If scenario that Hansel and Gretel were to build on their initial success and form a career out of hunting and destroying witches anywhere bounty hunter style.As you would already have seen in the trailer this is but one of their adventures shown in helping a village deal with the menace of the witch Muriel Famke Janssen who together with her posse of likeminded witches have kidnapped children in preparation of a ritual to be performed under the blood moon. And there's no other better for the job than for Hansel Jeremy Renner and Gretel Gemma Arterton engaged by the mayor thanks to the widespread news of their successful witch hunting exploits played over the opening credits. The rest of the story is nothing but set action piece after set action piece paced frantically without any pause longer than necessary with a story that ties it all in to their origins and going full circle.clocking in at just under 90 minutes the movie has two surprise acts and characters best kept under wraps one to reverse the mantra that the witch hunters adopt to their methods and the other a fine character introduced that shed clues to their origin story. Jeremy Renner continues in his sharing of the limelight in roles he had chosen of late preferring to be the team player from the Impossible Mission Force to the Avengers and continues as one half of the brothersister team. Gemma Arterton is perhaps best known for her role as the Bond girl in Quantum of Solace with her dramatic roles having never made it here. And having another Bond girl in Famke Janssen in yet another villainous role also helped although every character in this film is pretty one dimensional.But this is an actionadventure taking a well known fairy tale and giving it a license to thrill with blood and gore. While most of the effects are CG laden it doesn't flinch from wanting to showcase burning at the stakes and various forms of dismemberment and beheadings that increases its body count in very gory terms. It's a story about witch hunting in a fantasy setting and it exploits this setting perfectly. A definite recommend for any action junkie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lately we have seen a lot of these fairy tale remakes where they take a basic fairy tale plot add in a lot of CGI slightly darker atmosphere and some sex and call it a day. I still prefer the Disney version thank you very much. At least in those films the story flows smoothly and the characters are not cardboard cutouts. That being said this particular fairy tale movie was a pleasant surprise. For one it didn't try to retell the same exact story we have grown up with. Rather it took the story of Hansel and Gretel and asked the question What if they grew up? I'm totally on board with that question. It's something we've never seen before and frankly it's a fascinating idea. So yeah colour me interested.The film itself ends up being pretty much what anyone would expect. I hesitate to call it a good film because it has numerous plot holes nonsensical twists and its characters are somewhat bland and clichd. On the other hand it has a good visual style its action is very pleasing if a bit gorefilled not a bad thing in this case the two main actors are actually pretty good in their roles and as a whole it's just plain solid fun. Yeah it's stupid most of the time but it's fun kind of stupid. The kind where you're just able to sit back enjoy the scenery and laugh at the jokes.It also needs to be remembered that this was Tommy Wirkola's first big budget film. And for a debut film this shows a lot of promise. The style is definitely there as is the atmosphere. The storytelling and the character development need some work but even big name directors struggle with those every now and then. I'm looking forward to what this guy will bring us next.And that's this film. Yeah it's one of those so bad it's good films but I'd still recommend this. The idea alone is worth checking out.".

I still prefer the Disney version thank you very much. At least in those films the story flows smoothly and the characters are not cardboard cutouts.

A profoundly pathetic and pointless effort entitled Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters a motion picture so bad in its design development and execution that a Roget's Thesaurus is needed just to accurately describe how horrible and with as much variety as possible the experience of watching it was.Written with a crayon and directed with a circus mallet by Tony Wirkola Dead Snow this film tries to be a Red Riding Hood meets Snow White and the Huntsman meets The Brothers Grimm meets the Evil Dead trilogy but succeeds only in overlapping itself in a most embarrassing bog of amateurish inanity despite a most merciful running time of just 88 minutes and you thought The Hobbit seemed longwinded.Everyone has obviously read or has been read the story of how the wicked stepmother forced the meek father to take young Hansel and Gretel into the woods where they discovered a lifesize gingerbread house and the evil witch that lived there. The crone then tried to eat the boy but the kids outwit her and she ends up baked to a crisp in her own oven.This film begins with pretty much the same tale only we're now told through a series of what looks like medieval newspaper clippings that the siblings have grown up and have become bounty hunters taking on  and totally destroying  witch after cackling witch. Now years later they show up at a town where 11 children have been suddenly taken away.A diabetic yep all that candy he has the sugar disease Hansel played by Jeremy Renner The Bourne Legacy The Avengers and a wisecracking Gretel Gemma Arterton Prince of Persia The Sands of Time are hired by the milquetoast mayor Rainer Bock but detested by Ausberg's sheriff Peter Stormare The Last Stand and the only character with any real sense and manage to save an accused sorceress Mina Pihla Viitala a series of Finnish films and TV series no one has heard of and do a little detective work  very little.They soon discover that there is a bad moon rising  actually a blood moon  that can make witches inflammable although since they are dispatched here in other various ways it's not much of a defense. This event evidently takes place once every few years or so and causes the witches to gather together in what looks like a lowrent ComicCon.In the course of their investigations Hans and sis are also easily able to destroy the ugly supernatural entities with little or no effort thanks to superior weapons and clever patter that will not exist for at least another 700 years.Shotguns automatic pistols hand grenades Gattling guns and a crossbow that fires hundreds of arrows per minute  and in all directions  seemingly came from nowhere while characters use words like hillbilly weird awesome and the aforementioned F bombs.The dialogue was obviously stolen from another Middle Age dud from a few years back Your Highness although I NEVER thought I would miss the subtle and nuanced acting abilities of Danny McBride. Compared to this script The only good witch is a dead witch that movie seems like Shakespeare.And if Hansel and Gretel are not bad enough they are ably assisted by Ben Thomas Mann who appears as if he failed an audition to be the fifth member of the Big Bang Theory gang as well as a giant troll who looks like a cross between Andre the Giant and Luis Guzman. They seem invincible despite the inclusion of Thomas Mann. However the group soon runs into a super witch Muriel Famke Janssen Taken 2 and the tables are suddenly turned.Is there really a point in my continuing to describe the plot of this pointless endeavor? Do we care that Hansel's hatred of witches borders on the sociopathic and makes him look like an Old World version of a rednecked Southern bigot during the Civil Rights era? Do we care that Gretel discovers a terrible secret about her own mother as well as herself? Do we care that Hansel isn't a very good swimmer? Do we care about ANY of this ludicrous nonsense? The answer is a resounding and unequivocal no my friends. Had any of the basic elements of filmcraft acting direction story been even slightly evident here I could dismiss this movie's faults as just a terribly mediocre January release and been done with it. There are so many glaringly awful things about this motion picture however that my obligation as a critic  and a human being  behooves me to warn the paying public to avoid this travesty at all costs.Then with an extra 3 to 5 being charged for viewing in 3D the general public is being taken for a ride in this department too considering this technology adds nothing to the experience because mainly the movie is so dark drab and depressing no one can tell what is going on anyway.This is especially proved by the concluding battle which is a confusing obscured mishmosh of people and things being tossed about with little or no audience comprehension or even the slightest concern for anyone or anything by that point.After a very successful film run including a pair of Academy Awardnominated performances it may have been time for Renner to suffer a slight career letdown  it's just a shame all of us had to witness it.".

With the short runtime of 1 hour and 28 minutes you can expect this to move briskly and to be packed with a lot of action.The story The movie starts with the young Hansel and Gretel losing their parents. They are shortly picked by a witch to be food. They manage to escape and burn the witch alive and that's how they become witch hunter. Cue to the opening credit. The next scene shows them saving an innocent woman whom is accused of being a witch. And from there the action keeps going. There are some slight twists about the innocent woman and Hansel and Gretel's parents. Other than that it is purely straightforward for a good thing. The action scenes are not bad but they are more gritty than fantastical. Music wise is quite alright with Han Zimmer acting as the music supervisor.3D It is okay. As many of the scenes take place at night the 3D effect dampens. It becomes more like harder to see. But when it comes to explosions blood splatters and action it is gimmicky with objects flying to your face. Other than that the 3D is not really recommended unless you have some spare money.Overall It is not bad for the month of January. Sure there is a great potential that the movie never reach but Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters won't disappoint if you want a good entertainment packed with action. Next fairy tale movie is Jack the Giant Slayer in Feb.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hansel  Gretel Witch Hunters 2013  out of 4Rrated gory horroradventure has brother and sisters Hansel Jeremy Renner and Gretal Gemma Arterton called to a small town to try and locate some children that have been kidnapped by some witches. Soon they realize that a Queen witch Famke Janssen has bigger plans that could have a major change on the world. HANSEL  GRETEL WITCH HUNTERS isn't quite as bad as some are making it out to be but there's no question that the entire film just has an uneasy mix of genres that never fully come together and in the end the film just came off as something that didn't know what it wanted to be or do. At times there's some campy comedy moments but these aren't good enough to save the picture. At other times we're given a fairly interesting look at two people hunting witches but the film doesn't do too much with this. We're also given a picture with some extremely graphic gore that comes out of nowhere. I really liked the fact that they went for a Rrating and didn't hold back for a smaller rating but at the same time if you took this away there really wouldn't be much to the movie. The film manages to be slightly entertaining because of this type of gore but at the same time I can see how it might not sit well with some more sensitive viewers. Another thing I liked was the actual look of the witches. The CGI effects were actually quite believable whenever the witches changed form in their faces. The look of the major witch was also quite nice and benefited from the strong and fun performance by Janssen who managed to bring a certain sexy nature to the role. Both Renner and Arterton are good in their parts but the screenplay really makes both characters quite boring and uninteresting. The supporting players here are usually much better and the movie probably would have benefited having them in it more. This includes an obsessed fan of the duo as well as an evil sheriff. Another problem with the film is that you just never really get involved with anything going on. It looks nice and some of the action scenes are put together nicely but there's just no real energy that brings you into the film.".

Going in I thought this will be one of those early newyear releases which movie studios always dump quickly and without great fanfare...its almost like an embarrassment dump slash quick cash grab...but Hansel  Gretel Witch Hunters is too slimy and its stench to powerful for something like that! And boy does it stink!!! One of the crummier movies I've seen in a while and more wasted time than I would have cared to!

It's a real shame when critics can't enjoy watching two of the coolest freshest actors totally ripping the guts out of evil witches in spectacularly gory style. We need more movies like this films that don't take themselves seriously and just aim for all out entertainment. Fast paced sharp and ferociously violent Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters is hands down the most fun and wildly over the top adventure of 2013 it will be hard to beat. The story is played out fast and loose just like the 3D and special effects which are insanely brilliant the action is explosive but the best feature is the acting. Jeremy Renner is very entertaining his humour is very blunt and deadpan and it's a change from his roles in Avengers Bourne  Mission Impossible. Gemma Arterton is very cool she takes a whole lot of punches and she fights back with brute force and most of the badass one liners come from her Let the girl go or I'm gonna blow you sheriff brains all over these hillbillies. It has to be said though that Famke Janssen is the best you can tell she is having a blast playing the evil witch Muriel whenever she comes on screen you can't help but smile and there's a sense of unpredictability with her character who knows what she will do next?! It's repeat viewing material and a heck of a blast and there is never a dull moment just all out action fun twists and a whole lot of laughter.".

Jeremy Renner is phenomenal as always and this was the first time I have seen Gemma Arterton but she was awesome in it too! It was refreshing to see a female lead who is a strong kickass lady who didn't have a romance attached to her in some way. It was a clever new take on a classic tale.

	schema:reviewBody "Recently we've become accustomed to seeing two types of fantasy romps  the darker ones such as 'Snow White and the Huntsman' and the less serious genremashup particularly Timur Bembakatov's 'Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter'. Consequently it's unsurprisingly that Hansel and Gretel would make it to the bigscreen once more however with this film they can't be said to fall into either category but conversely both. It's just unfortunate that the movie doesn't really work as either.Diluted down to its basics the story is something that would intrinsically appeal to a younger audience due to its fairytale roots but here it has been given a more 'grownup' treatment which means brash swearing nudity and of course violence. Subsequently this graphic content is done in too childish a manner to make the film an 'adult' one. At the same time it attempts to maintain a dark and grim atmosphere to possibly scare viewers which fails incidentally. Then on top of this there are scenes intended to be ones of genuine emotion to make you empathise with the characters and also scenes that strive to parody the fantasy genre. All of these elements are things that might just work together but here feel rather disjointed. Also it's been said that to properly make a parody of something you need to truly love it but here such scenes feel quite crass.I'm aware that this movie is not supposed to be a highbrow work of art it's supposed to be a slice of enjoyable fantasy adventure and don't get me wrong I love a good fantasy romp as much as the next man I even have a soft spot for 2004's 'Van Helsing' and often relish a nice dollop of violent and somewhat silly action having thoroughly enjoyed Zack Snyder's adaptation of '300'. Yet I'd struggle to relate this film to being anything remotely close to enjoyable I frequently tried to enjoy this movie but couldn't find any cause to with my interest consistently drifting off.The action scenes are remarkably unremarkable with editing that mightn't be out of place in a Michael Bay actioner and overstuffed with flimsy CGI. The characters themselves are unengaging with Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arteton striding around with American accents that just confounded me as other players such as Peter Stormare who can do much better than this have thick European accents. The creature makeup and design was nothing special and the ogre look unbelievably cheap. If you want to properly do fantasy creatures just look at someone like Guillermo del Toro. But most significantly the film was deathly dull boring and frankly forgettable.".

Now everyone pretty much knew the story of two kids who escape the wrath of a cannibal witch living in a candy house in the middle of the woods but what happens after that is revealed in this movie Hansel and Gretel become witch hunters. Heh as if Red Riding Hood meeting werewolves wasn't crazy enough.So the plot goes that after years of hunting witches the title characters come across a town and get hired by the local mayor to take of a strange matter of witches led by the wicked grand witch Muriel kidnapping children for a sinister purpose. As Hansel and Gretel soon learn that this is no ordinary case of a witch infestation can a dark secret from their past prove to be their salvation or their undoing?Right from the start the two protagonists are likable as well as very tough. They actually do act like brother and sister having a good time while having the occasional disagreement. The weapons they use are insane and the action scenes are a load of fun fastpaced and lots if gore and destruction. The music fits very well too complementing a lot of the action that goes on. The witch Muriel is actually a good villain enjoying every little evil deed she pulls off and seriously messing with our heroes. Throw in a little humor a couple of nice twists and excellent special effects from the CG to the monstrous design of the witches and you have one fun fairy tale roller coaster ride.Definitely one of the better reinterpretations of classic fairy tales out there that I have seen and worth a watch so check it out! Just don't bring any little kids into this one.".

	schema:headline " Internal Affairs A tense fearless police thriller and a showcase for Richard Gere.";
	schema:reviewBody "Internal Affairs is a thriller with a lot of nerve. It takes risks presenting the audience with a grim and violent story of police corruption. It doesn't care if you like it or hate it just that it does its job of getting under your skin. The main reason the movie is so effective is because of Richard Gere's powerhouse performance. It caught me off guard since before I saw it I'd always seen him as the hero or love interest far from the territory he's in here. I'll get more into Gere's performance later just let me clear up the plot.Gere is Dennis Peck respected vice cop father and husband determined to do the job. Oh he's also the dirtiest cop on the force. He plants evidence shoots suspects sets up his fellow officers doing it all without a shed of remorse. The hero of the movie is Raymond Avila Andy Garcia newly assigned to the Internal Affairs division of the LAPD and a friend of Peck's partner Van Stretch Stephen Baldwin. When Stretch introduces Peck and Avila it's obvious they don't like each other. Not getting along becomes an understatement as Avila starts to uncover Peck's corrupt behavior and looks to put a stop to it. But Peck won't go down without a fight and he'll do whatever he can to keep Internal Affairs off his back.As far as police thrillers go Internal Affairs is one of the meaner kind. Rather than put us into the normal day of a cop it decides to put us into the normal day of bad cop a really bad cop. This is a guy who would kill a man for stepping on his shoe. He'd probably kill his family too and laugh while he was doing it. Think I'm exaggerating? Not so much. Peck is the embodiment of all the bad guys in police thrillers and none of the cops in them.Of all of the actors you could find to play a guy like this who would have guessed that a likable actor like Richard Gere would ever fit the bill. Does he ever. He gives that kind of against type performance we see a lot from normally good guy actors. We've seen it from Denzel Washington Training Day Tom Cruise Collateral and Robin Williams Insomnia in the past few years. Each of these guys have given performances that have altogether changed how we see them as actors. Gere is no exception here. He seems to be having a blast too chewing the scenery every chance he gets.He's surrounded by some good supporting work. Andy Garcia gives Avila a kind of determination you'd expect from a guy who's life has been wrecked by a guy like Peck. As his partner Laurie Metcalf is likable and isn't as wasted as she could have been.But when it all comes down to it this is Gere's show and he shines in his only truly villainous role to date. He probably had enough of playing the villain by the time he was done with this movie. That would make sense. After playing a guy like Dennis Peck any actor would need time off from playing the bad guy. I'd like to see Gere play the bad guy again though and give us another surprising and terrifically evil performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have never quite seen a movie like this before.  In it Richard Gere plays his most sinister role and I think his best character in years.  There are many disturbing elements in this film and most of them are perpetrated by Richard Gere's Dennis Peck.  He knows how to manipulate people to get what he wants and if that doesn't work he uses other measures.The story goes like this  Richard Gere plays a cop that everyone owes a favour to.  He is everyone's friend and everyone's silent worst enemy.  He also lives a little above his income should allow him too and this is why he is being investigated by internal affairs.  Enter Andy Garcia as Raymond in a mesmerizing performance.  These two know they are going to square off in the film and Peck has fun tormenting him.Peck is a charismatic good looking wealthy play boy.  He knows how to use what he has to his advantage and that eventually means playing with Raymond's head to make him think that he is sleeping with his wife.  Did I mention that he is intuitive?  And this is established so brilliantly in one of their first meetings together that it makes you cringe.Peck introduces himself to Raymond and at first he seems very cooperative assuring Raymond that he realizes Ray has a job to do just like he does. But the conversation takes an abrupt turn when Peck begins to hit too close to home when he begins to question how good Raymond's love life is right now.  He knows he spends too much time at the office and that he has a beautiful young wife that may be neglected.  The scene works beautifully and sets up the psychological battle that takes place between the two as the film goes on.  The next scene they have with each other is enough to make every man cringe at the cruelty of it.Internal Affairs is a character study at it's finest.  There are few films out there that can compare to this one and that can be attributed to the director Mike Figgis.  He hits every note perfectly and the performances he gets from his cast is such a joy to watch.  I am surprised that Andy Garcia hasn't gone on to be bigger than he is because he was outstanding here.This is an absolute must see for anyone that hasn't had the pleasure of doing so yet.  But beware there are some scenes that will get under your skin especially if you spend too much time at the office and you have a beautiful woman waiting for you at home.  What is she doing right now?  Who is she with?  Are you paranoid or are your concerns real?  This film has fun with that paranoia.".

However Peck knows how to exploit weakness in those around him and begins to clear up the loose links around him while pushing all Raymond Avila's buttons.This was Figgis' first American film and he made an excellent start.  The dark plot is pretty simple in terms of beginning middle start.  What makes it so much more than that is the characters are so well drawn.  Peck and Avila both become like each other the more we know about them their methods their thoughts and their weaknesses are all similar.  It makes it harder to fit everyone into the mould of good guys and bad guys and keeps everything more interesting.  The various twists don't always make sense but the film is forceful enough to keep everything moving.Gere is on best form here playing a character against type he is the embodiment of corruption deceit and murder.  Garcia is also excellent as Raymond who blends his actions well from good into bad.  Metcalfe is excellent as Garcia's partner who may or may not be motivated by the hatred of Gere's macho personae.  It's also good to see Baldwin Travis and Xander Berkley have good roles.Overall this is a dark thriller that blends characters into one mess of corruption in the police.

After filming had been completed Garcia refused to attend the postproduction party.Knowing this watch the film again. The tension between the two is palpable in just about every scene they're in together. Which makes for a pretty decent movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Right before Pretty Woman 1990 Gere played smarmy womanizing multidivorced prick LA street cop Dennis Peck taking money from the likes of pimps and drugdealers in order to provide for his four wives and nine ! kids. Peck likes to spread the seed around. He's in for a rude awakening when young Hispanic Internal Affairs agent Raymond Avilla Andy Garcia investigates Peck's partner Van Stretch William Baldwyn prone to violent outbursts and other criminal activities. Avilla wants Peck and hopes to get Van to turn on him. Peck not only takes money for prostitution and drugs but also negotiates executions as is the case with a businessman's parents! Peck isn't about to not only take money and arrange gangbangers to execute the businessman's parents but feels free to bang the guy's wife as well! When Peck realizes the threat to his livelihood he makes it a mission to torment Avilla provoking his jealousy in regards to a wife a smokin' Nancy Travis I'm telling you Travis has never been this foxy! needing some lovin' knowing Peck's reputation as a womanizer Avilla does feel a sense of uncertainty because his overworking nature to find evidence against the smartaleck nogood cop leaves little time for a wife wanting affection and attention from her husband and removing anyone that might point a finger at his direction. Considering the possible notoriety behind the scenes between Gere and Garcia's inability to get along their time on screen benefits significantly from the intensity animosity and hostility shared between the two characters Peck and Avilla. Gere fires on all cylinders in this performance full of swagger and aggression with a character that would easily dupe you into believing he's on your side while all the while setting up your execution. Seemingly no conscience except when with his children or compassion exists in this man and Peck has built enough bad juju for punishment to visit upon him with violent and swift justice. I like how the film establishes that Avilla's obsessions like getting a cop associated with Peck Dorian Michael Beach on Homicide are turning him into Peck. There's a really volatile scene where Avilla confronts his wife in a restaurant about her possible involvement with Peck that registers offthecharts Avilla even smacks her upside the jaw dropping panties stolen by Peck from her room at her face! Laurie Metcalf Roseanne The Big Bang Theory has a nifty supporting part as Avilla's lesbian partner Amy Wallace. Where Internal Affairs feels conventional is in the partner getting hurt and the wife being threatened by the villain. The inevitable showdown doesn't quite match the earlier macho exchanges eliciting plenty of fireworks between the opposing cops. Gere dominates his scenesevery last one of themwhile Garcia can stare down those associates of Avilla with a moral compass blazing a trail from his eyes that leaves them really uncomfortable and on edge a great example is the wife of Van played by Faye Grant who has a disdain for the IA but cannot look Avilla in the eyes she had been screwing around with Peck behind Van's back. Annabella Sciorra has limited involvement in the film as Peck's newest wife eventually helping Avilla take down her sleazy husband it was either her children or Peck with few options available to her as Avilla forces her hand. Baldwin's demise thanks to Gere is hard to watch because it is coming and Van doesn't have a clue he's about to take a shotgun blast to the chest. Not quite dying Peck assists with a choke hold strangling the remaining life from him. This along with the discovery of the parents under the giant Hollywood sign just illustrates fully how evil he really is. He at the end uses his children's welfare as an excuse for all of his activities Gere's whole purpose is to make us despise his character and in that he succeeds.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the face of it Internal Affairs is a routine crime drama about an investigation into the activities of an LAPD cop who's suspected of being corrupt. What elevates this movie to another level however is a sensational performance by Richard Gere as an extremely memorable villain who's not only corrupt cruel and complex but also extremely manipulative and murderous.Dennis Peck Richard Gere is a street cop who's popular and respected by his superiors. He's a married man with three exwives and 8 kids and enjoys good relationships with all of them. Over the years he's been helpful to many of his fellow officers and his ability to call in favours from them whenever needed has provided him with a powerbase which he effectively used to operate his criminal activities.Peck comes to the attention of a newly appointed LAPD Internal Affairs investigator called Raymond Avila Andy Garcia after the conduct of his partner Van Stretch William Baldwin gives cause for concern. Avila and another investigator called Amy Wallace Laurie Metcalf interview the young cop and it quickly becomes clear that he's a drug addicted racist who's prone to outbursts of unprovoked violence. Subsequent checks into Stretch's financial status and Peck's extra curricular activities then start to raise certain suspicions.A short time later Stretch is killed on duty and the body of his killer is found nearby. Peck explains that he shot the murderer but doesn't disclose that the killer was actually a hitman employed by him. Avila suspects this and soon elicits the confirmation he needs from one of the hitman's associates before going on to discreetly keep Peck under surveillance.Peck is adept at identifying people's weaknesses and exploiting them for his own purposes and so arranges a confidential meeting with Avila's neglected wife Kathleen Nancy Travis. He asks her some questions which he infers he's authorised to do but his real purpose is to unsettle Avila who he knows will see his meeting with Kathleen and become uncontrollably jealous.Peck's plan works well and Avila becomes so unhinged that he embarrasses and beats his wife in public at her workplace. Despite this spectacular loss of control Avila and Wallace are later able to continue their determined investigation to its conclusion although there is a significant price to be paid for what they achieve.The tense atmosphere which runs through this movie is predominantly generated by its brooding score and the intensity of the conflict between Avila and Peck who are both tough uncompromising and remarkably similar in certain ways. The threat of extreme violence is also ever present as Stretch and Avila are both volatile men who can't control their tempers and also beat their wives.Avila appears to be cold confident and conventional when he's first appointed to his new job but as events proceed it becomes clear that he's very ambitious has problems with his marriage and also has a darker side to his personality which is brought out when Peck pushes the right buttons. Andy Garcia does well as he portrays the range of behaviours of his character who lacks any real warmth or the ability to empathize with others.Peck is a charming psychopath and an inveterate womaniser and Richard Gere's magnificent as he shows brilliantly his ability to be equally convincing whether he's playing the helpful colleague a calculating manipulator of other people or a vicious killer.Internal Affairs is ultimately a surprisingly enjoyable movie with some strong characters and an exceptional villain.".

	schema:headline " Richard Gere plays against type in the interesting thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "'Internal Affairs' has two protagonists Dennis Peck an LA street cop who is highly regarded and has opted to stay on the streets rather than climb the promotion ladder and Raymond Avilla and cop who has just joined the Internal Affairs Division. Avilla's first case involves Peck's partner Van Stretch a man accused of planting drugs on a suspect... and an old friend of Avilla's. After a run in with Peck Avilla has a feeling that he may be dirty too the more he hears the more convinced he is but he will need far more evidence if he is to go up against the force's poster boy. With plenty of evidence against Stretch he offers him a deal if he will name other dirty cops. He says no but later tells his wife he is going to take the deal a mistake since she was with Peck at the time. Peck arranges for Stretch to be killed there is still no evidence against him though. As the investigation continues Peck starts to goad Avilla insinuating that he has slept with his wife... a suggestion that gets just the reaction Peck wanted. The closer the investigation gets to Peck the more dangerous it gets for Avilla and his partner as Peck is owed favours by a lot of people.This was a fine thriller Richard Gere did a fine job playing against type as the corrupt cop Peck the more we got to know the character the more evil he seemed playing opposite him Andy Garcia is as good playing honest cop Avilla a character who could self destruct if he continues to let Peck get under his skin. Other notable performances come from Laurie Metcalf who plays Avilla's partner Amy Wallace and William Baldwin as Van Stretch. Director Mike Figgis did a fine job keeping things tense throughout the film I also liked how some questions remained unanswered notably whether or not a key character would survive after being seriously wounded. I'd certainly recommend this film to fans of Gere and Garcia as well as to anybody who likes a decent crime thriller.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Internal Affairs' has two protagonists Dennis Peck an LA street cop who is highly regarded and has opted to stay on the streets rather than climb the promotion ladder and Raymond Avilla and cop who has just joined the Internal Affairs Division. Avilla's first case involves Peck's partner Van Stretch a man accused of planting drugs on a suspect... and an old friend of Avilla's. After a run in with Peck Avilla has a feeling that he may be dirty too the more he hears the more convinced he is but he will need far more evidence if he is to go up against the force's poster boy. With plenty of evidence against Stretch he offers him a deal if he will name other dirty cops. He says no but later tells his wife he is going to take the deal a mistake since she was with Peck at the time. Peck arranges for Stretch to be killed there is still no evidence against him though. As the investigation continues Peck starts to goad Avilla insinuating that he has slept with his wife... a suggestion that gets just the reaction Peck wanted. The closer the investigation gets to Peck the more dangerous it gets for Avilla and his partner as Peck is owed favours by a lot of people.This was a fine thriller Richard Gere did a fine job playing against type as the corrupt cop Peck the more we got to know the character the more evil he seemed playing opposite him Andy Garcia is as good playing honest cop Avilla a character who could self destruct if he continues to let Peck get under his skin. Other notable performances come from Laurie Metcalf who plays Avilla's partner Amy Wallace and William Baldwin as Van Stretch. Director Mike Figgis did a fine job keeping things tense throughout the film I also liked how some questions remained unanswered notably whether or not a key character would survive after being seriously wounded. I'd certainly recommend this film to fans of Gere and Garcia as well as to anybody who likes a decent crime thriller.";

I wanted more dynamic between her and the Andy Garcia character. Her domestic or personal situation was not gone into at all. She was a cool reserved if somewhat mysterious presence.

	schema:reviewBody "Dennis Peck has so many wives and children by his assorted marriages that he doesn't know what to do other than steal to support them. And for leisure seduce other men's wives into extramarital affairs. He may be the most exceedingly debased and debasing crooked cop in a congested movie category. His reaction to a departmental investigation is to warn that he'll seduce the wife of head detective Raymond Avilla if he doesn't suppress the case. No doubt Internal Affairs is a biting occasionally savage piece of work. Gere's magnetic as Peck writer Henry Bean's composition is absorbing save for the comparatively lockstep finale and director Mike Figgis a maker of moody frequently experimental dramas and thrillers known for his psychological investigation of characters knows how to turn on a restrained genuine sensual intensity.Figgis never lets the tempo decelerate long enough to reveal the narrative's slenderness regardless of looking back a less than average quantity of action. Figgis gets how to latch the viewer without relying on that. The lifeanddeath game played by the main characters may not be inventive but few will leave the movie feeling resentful or ungratified. Avilla's emotional intensity in jeopardy does not let up but increases. The emotional and physical stakes for him become more complicated. There's a focus on feelings relationships and interactions. It's very intense never melodramatic.Police movies are an everyday assembly line. Thrillers about unscrupulous cops are no less numerous. Regardless items of this genre in which there's a compelling histrionic between the protagonist and the antagonist are significantly more exceptional. That's the case here. Peck's a vicious individual with no range of principles and Avilla's a boy scout. As the two cross each other's thresholds Peck draws on his sociopathic scheming to an unusually and potently affecting degree. The stunning product of his calculating is that he snaps the stonefaced tightrope that keeps Avilla's primordial compulsions dormant. These two end up colliding on Peck's ground with each horsing around the other as they plummet out of control. Peck's most ferocious swipe is the way he pushes a block between Avilla and his harmless wife.John Alonzo's cinematography alters the nighttime panoramas of Los Angeles into something bleakly alluring. It's a place that purely exists in the movies. That's not to say it's sparkly and cookiecutter because it isn't but it's picturesque in a way that only something exhaustively dishonest and illusory can be. This is the setting through which Peck and Avilla forcefully implement their combat becoming gradually less concerned about the outside world. And that works to the advantage of the strong performances by Gere and Garcia. They're not pretending or faking phoning anything in. They're being profoundly candid more so than what passes for honest behavior in the outside world the world outside the movies. That's acting! One key development by Figgis and Bean is not to portray Peck right off as a unilaterally nasty human being. In his early scenes his first impression is a sociable man who cuts corners and throats to lend a hand to those close to him. He is illustrated as a devoted husband and father a loyal friend and a respected officer. Sheen after sheen the luster is removed to expose Peck not only as a good guy gone bad but as his own personal onetrack target of revenge and salvage of pride.".

Seeing it a second time brought some dynamics to the surface that had escaped me.The performances are really quite good. Richard Gere shows that he can be as good an evil tough guy as he can be a good tough guy. He's not so good when it comes to displaying fear and weakness. He has a tendency to strut rather than walk sort of like Johnny Cochran as if he really can't help it. The script gives his character some depth. He seems genuinely to love his family especially his children. His last words are about children. This theme recurs and is more revealing than a mere quirk such as Allan Ladd's affection for a cat in This Gun For Hire. It doesn't make him less evil simply more human. And what is Annabella Sciorra as his wife doing so far down on the list of credits with her memorable Mediterranean beauty? Nancy Travis turns in a nicely tempered performance as well. Her physical appeal beneath that fright wig is real but quirky a bit like Susan Clark's. And if her skirts were any shorter and tighter she could run for President of the United States. I admired Andy Garcia as the Internal Affairs investigator. He has the brooding intensity of Brando or Poitier but here doesn't have the chance to display much range. Still the script humanizes him. He registers not simply as the good guy but as a violently overpossessive husband. In other words the writers have given the bad guy some familiar virtues and the good guy some weaknesses common to men. Laurie Metcalf's lesbian partner isn't given an opportunity to show more than one dimension but her character provides a stolid and humorless prop. The supporting players are uniformly fine. There are several scenes of slow motion violence and death which have now become as commonplace as they are pointless. The last meaningful slowmotion deaths in the sense that they served a dramatic as well as simply visual purpose may have been in Pekinpah's The Wild Bunch. He probably got it from Bonnie and Clyde where it also belonged if Penn were to make his populist point. The cops and other innocent victims in Bonnie and Clyde get shot at ordinary speed and almost always at a distance so we don't have to feel as sorry for the bourgeoisie as we do for the rebels who are torn apart in a slowmotion fusillade. It may have all started with Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai back in the early 50s in which slow death followed almost imperceptibly quick swordplay. Kurosawa should get the credit for the original use of this technique but not the blame for slow motion's subsequently being imposed on scenes of killing of fistfights of bodies and cars crashing through plate glass windows of bodies and objects plummeting from office buildings and bridges and horses and  well you get the picture. The indiscriminate use of the technique is an insult to viewers. It's as if the director and his cronies thought of us as fiveyear olds howling and clapping gleefully as sparkling shards of breakaway glass fill the air. Basta! Please!".

	schema:reviewBody "Pictures are not the real life but a thriller should at least have a plausible story. Unfortunately Internal Affairs provides too many logical gaps e.g.The supervisors turn down Ray and Amy's investigation concerning Dennis Peck because there is no probable cause for an accusal. But there still remain several questions e.g. how Van Stretch and Peck could afford their lifestyles leading to sufficient reason to carry on the investigation until there either is probable cause or the suspicion is clearly incapable of proof. Reasonably the supervisors would be interested in finding the truth before deciding if there is probable cause for an accusal.When Ray Amy and Dorian try to get the Latino guy a SWATteam shows up and shoots Dorian. Firstly I wonder that it takes no more than a call from P2Cop Dennis Peck to start such an operation. Secondly police forces are legally required to at least try to arrest people alive and not just shoot around with machine guns. Thirdly why do they shoot Dorian and Amy? Even if the SWAT guys did not hear them shouting that they were police officers these two would not have been objects of the operation anyway.Every woman in his personal environment falling for Dennis Peck wife exwife his partner's wife Arroca's wife the black hooker is just over the top. Okay Richard Gere is a cutie but sorry I cannot believe that they don't even care about being part of a harem and in part still remain sort of friends. Quite a tacky view of women I have to say.The end was disappointing. It would have been so much more satisfying if Peck had been convicted instead of being shot by Ray like Peck apparently preferred himself  why else would he show up at his apartment?. Again Ray would have been obligated to try to arrest him and thus aiming at Peck's feet or something before shooting his chest twice!.An unintentional funny moment is the dirty talk between Kathleen and Ray in the museum using the words brush and to paint for ... well you figure out yourself. I am aware of the late 80's early 90's style and can go for it  but come on! In spite of everything it remains an ordinarily entertaining police thriller as Gere's and Garcia's performance apparently cannot be ruined by a bad script.".

	onyx:emotionText "Pictures are not the real life but a thriller should at least have a plausible story. Unfortunately Internal Affairs provides too many logical gaps e.g.The supervisors turn down Ray and Amy's investigation concerning Dennis Peck because there is no probable cause for an accusal. But there still remain several questions e.g. how Van Stretch and Peck could afford their lifestyles leading to sufficient reason to carry on the investigation until there either is probable cause or the suspicion is clearly incapable of proof. Reasonably the supervisors would be interested in finding the truth before deciding if there is probable cause for an accusal.When Ray Amy and Dorian try to get the Latino guy a SWATteam shows up and shoots Dorian. Firstly I wonder that it takes no more than a call from P2Cop Dennis Peck to start such an operation. Secondly police forces are legally required to at least try to arrest people alive and not just shoot around with machine guns. Thirdly why do they shoot Dorian and Amy? Even if the SWAT guys did not hear them shouting that they were police officers these two would not have been objects of the operation anyway.Every woman in his personal environment falling for Dennis Peck wife exwife his partner's wife Arroca's wife the black hooker is just over the top. Okay Richard Gere is a cutie but sorry I cannot believe that they don't even care about being part of a harem and in part still remain sort of friends.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was tailor made for Richard Gere. I have always thought that even though he's a decent actor he is at his best when he plays cold evil characters. Basically Andy Garcia plays an ambitious IAD cop that is out to get Gere who is a dirty cop. This would be a spoiler but since the trailers already gave this up I find no problem in revealing it!!! I wouldn't really call it a thriller because there is no mystery as to who Gere is. The movie is really a study of the 2 cops. Gere is the obvious villain but he fancies himself as a loving family man who loves children. On the other hand Garcia is married  with no children and seems to be cold and selfcentered. Even though the movie puts him as the quote hero he really isn't a likable guy he neglects his wife he is also presented as a Latin macho guy. I guess that Mike Figgis wanted the 2 sides of the same coin thing between Gere and Garcia. It works to a point but there comes a point in the film where it all gets a little too ridiculous to be really effective. Gere gets to a point that he is so bad that you would think that all he would need is to grow horns!!! It is more style than substance. The movie is never boring it keeps your attention  but is not truly engaging. The saving grace is Laurie Metcalf she plays the ONLY likable character in the film. It isn't great but it is entertaining on a sleazy soap opera level.Grade C".

Definitely worth seeing for all the right reasons. Very entertaining and kept my attention throughout.

The rest of the characters are underdeveloped and onedimensional and it becomes difficult at times to separate Jenn in this role from her role in the Hunger Games. For about half of the film we're led to believe that the little girl locked away is a rabid serial killer. However there is a HUGE plot twist at the end one that is smarter and scarier than the standard horror fare we're used to. With that said the first half of the film drags do we really care about Jenn's rock concert practices? but certain parts are mysterious enough for viewers to put in the effort to connect the dots. If you're a Jennifer Lawrence fan or love Criminal MindsLaw and Order SVU check this movie out. If you're looking for a haunted house movie you've clicked on the wrong flick.

Because its actually got a storyline and it keeps you thinking! Just when you think you've figured it all out there's another clever twist that comes along and makes you think Gee why didn't I think of that. This is a movie which is always one step ahead of you!

He is really slacking off. We are here with Elissa Jennifer Lawrence and her Mom Elisabeth Shue moving from the big city to a small town looking for a new start. Ofcourse the house next door was apparently the location of a double murder where a little girl killed her parents and then disappeared herself. The little girl's brother Max Thieriot still lives in the home despite the tragedy. The adults hate him because his presence keeps them from bulldozing the house and its drain on the local housing market and the teenagers hate him because his parents were murdered? There really is no explanation for this other than everyone in this town is apparently a jerk. Just go with it. That's the best were going to get. Elissa starts to fall for Ryan and also has a hard time understanding the massive hate he gets when her mom and the neighborhood object to their relationship. But whether it for protecting the good or serving the forces of evil Ryan has secrets of his own and as the two get close things begin to get creepy. AllegedlyMinus a few jump scares that I'm not afraid to admit made me drop my popcorn due to some sharp sound editing this is no horror flick. HATES was advertised as scary business to get the target teenage audience' butts in the seats but is merely a SuspenseThriller with young leads. With the exception of a single twist that will shock some and slightly nudge others everything is played rather straight. There's not much new to see here and there is certainly nothing to be scared of. Even after the true evil is finally revealed there just doesn't seem to be much of a threat at any point. HATES is still indeed watchable. That's mostly due to Jennifer Lawrence who shines bright amidst all the average. It's impressive how she takes something as boring as a high school girl falling for the mysterious guy with a past adds heart and makes it more interesting than it was written. When in danger she's believably strong willed and could be the perfect Scream Queen for a horror film deserving of it. Elisabeth Shue played the part of concerned mother well and Max Thieriot didn't detract either. The problems with the film are rather in its constant plot holes and lack of anything interesting original or more importantly scary for a film that calls itself Horror.".

I didn't care about them what happened to them or what they will do. They all felt too generic to even listen to sometimes. I kind of got the impression they were attempting a modernized Psycho twist for teens. But it didn't come off at all. The first half or maybe quarter was all right.

I thought the film could have went one direction but when it came to the intersection it looked at the right direction gave it the finger and went in the wrong one. I really had hopes for this one but it didn't deliver.All in all a terrible film. The only good thing about it is the first 2030 minutes some welldirected sequences and Jennifer Lawrence. That's all.

Had it not been for all the talk about it I might have had lowered expectations and therefore a smaller sense of disappointment.As the Horror freak that I am I've always loved Psychological ThrillerHorror films with a sophisticated twist towards the end. This film makes an attempt on having such a twist but personally for me it didn't work.Let's start off with the good things the acting was very good especially by Max Thieriot as Ryan. The way he talked the look in his eyes everything was simply perfect for the role. Jennifer Lawrence wasn't bad either but sadly the best part about her acting was her not being an eyesore not at all. Great job also by Elisbabeth Shue as a teenagers's mother!As for the story  I find it difficult to pinpoint my problem with it. The build up seemed sufficient and the twist was surprising enough and kept up getting deeper and more evolved. Perhaps it's the difficulty to fully grasp and comprehend what had happened happened that took some of the excitement away. I was too busy figuring out one detail when the next hit. So perhaps other viewers will enjoy it more.All in all watching this has been a fun experience though not overly. I can't say don't watch it! nor can I recommend it too enthusiastically.

For once I was thinking 'where could this go?' And then halfway through the second act it clicks but this is thanks to the film makers just being lazy.It's not a horror film and although there are a lot of jump scares it's all down to over use of orchestral music and the film homaging other classic movies there is one scene at the end that reminded me of Silence of the Lambs but it was effective.The main cast are great but support is just your awful typecast frat boys and geeks who add nothing to the film.Lawrence proves that winters bone was no one trick pony she really excels with the material and although it goes into Pacific HeightsFearYUnlawful EntrySingle White Female mode during the finale she manages to make the film a little bit better than it should be.There is a little twist at the end but you half expected it.My advice is try not to read anything about this film because if I had I wouldn't have had enjoyed it half as much as I did knowing nothing about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember this film doing extremely well in the theatre so before I watched it on DVD I read some reviews and I was shocked at how bad ALL the reviews were. People were endlessly complaining about the movie and no shocker at all I disagree with them. Actually I don't disagree with them I agree with some of what they say about the film I just didn't think it made a less than enjoyable experience. I love horror and I love thrillers and this is what makes for a turn your brain off thriller slasher flick with some decent twists and turns. I don't care how many pretentious reviewers claim they had it all figured out you won't have it all figured out. Is the film mildly predictable? Yes absolutely but its hard for a horror film not to be. House At The End of The Street is an old school PG thriller similar to Scream in some aspects but it is very genre specific and follows the recipe to a T without changing many of the ingredients. But if you're okay with that and you like genre specific movies then you'll really enjoy this one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat with plenty of cringe worthy moments. It has a clear and concise climax and an edge of your seat ending.It certainly doesn't hurt to have someone the calibre of Jennifer Lawrence at the helm of the movie. I'm not so sure that she should still be playing 17 year old girls but as an old school scream queen she fits the bill very nicely. Her character is as cut and dry as you can imagine. Teenager with a rebel streak who has a mother trying to do better by her. Moves to a new town and befriends the rebel boy...and she does everything that the 70's and 80's Scream queens taught us not to do...run up instead of down out instead of in away from the killer instead of towards him. None of this bothered me because I enjoy chuckling at the campy quality of an old school thriller like this. Lawrence carries the film well and fits the bill perfectly. Elisabeth Shue is one of two performances that are genuinely bad in this movie. She personifies the campiness and the predictability by her facial expressions and character performance. She was just really annoying so much so that you understood how Lawrence's character felt towards her. The other really campy performance was by Gil Bellows as the Sheriff. Bellows screams camp nowadays and this role must have been huge for him getting away from the straight to video. He was only marginally better than Shue but they shared so many scenes together that it was double the camp. Max Thieriot does an excellent job as the quiet loner Ryan. He fits the throwback thriller role absolutely perfectly and the closing scene on him is memorable and fun. Thieriot and Lawrence have great chemistry making their character arc together even better.I could list for you two dozen movies right now that House At The End Of The Street rips off blatantly and unapologeticaly. It reeks of everything from Halloween to Psycho to Sleepaway Camp and how much did that ruin it for me? Well not even a little bit. I love those movies so why would it ruin House at The End of The Street for me. No matter how much something copies something else its still new characters some new concept and as long as its well executed then I'm there!! I think a more experienced director could have really fine tuned the details but Mark Tonderai still does a decent job and any other time he would be heralded for doing an homage to 80's thrillers so I will give him his herald. I thought it was very entertaining and well done. Campy at times? Yes absolutely and also predictable in some aspects but for a genre film it is exactly what one should expect and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a thriller. 8.510".

There's even a scene in the last few minutes that is mostly a scenefor scene of the night vision bit from Silence of the Lambs.The cinematography is awful. During moments of emotional drama the camera is all but three inches from the actors faces. The camera is shaky through almost all of the movie from which my friend became nauseous. They do that cheesy move slowly towards object of interest thing.The director seems to want you feel for the characters by shoving their life problems in your face within the first few minutes Oh teenage girl has problems with her mother. Oh teenage guy is shunned by everyone. Are we supposed to feel for these onedimensional characters? Allinall a terrible movie. It's definitely NOT for horror fans.

It's probably better than it should be simply for the presence of Jennifer Lawrence  who is just smoking hot. Okay she's a good actress too and gives a good performance. She won an Oscar last year for Silver Linings Playbook much deserved in my book. Her tank top from this film should have been nominated for an award. Okay enough about how hot Lawrence is very is the answer. The story here is decent if nothing special. Lawrence moving into a new home falls for the damaged teen down the street Max Thieriot also pretty good. His horrifying past his parents were murdered by his insane sister is well known to the small town they live in. He harbors a few other secrets as well. This mostly wins for me because Lawrence comes off as a fairly smart horror heroine. The climactic sequence is really well done shades of the climax of Wait Until Dark  would have been nice to see this in the theater as I came really close to doing last year. Elisabeth Shue also costars as Lawrence's mom. She's still good looking and is a fine actress. I'd love to see her in a really good role at this point in her career.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I just caught this movie September 30 2012 and I really wanted to like it. But when I saw the decreasing rating from 6.4 to now 5.9 I was worried. I asked what's wrong with this movie? and should I even go see it? I am so glad I ignored the bad rating. I normally don't care what other people about movies but I was a little skeptical to see it after seeing so many bad reviews. House at the End of the Street is about Elissa and her mom Sarah moving to a new house that is very cheap because the house next door had a doublemurder of the parents there by their daughter CarrieAnn. Elissa meets the surviving son Ryan and befriends him unbeknownst to her that he is hiding CarrieAnn in his basement and a dark secret. Jennifer Lawrence is probably one of my favorite actresses and the movies I've seen her in she is phenomenal. She proved herself once again that she is a worthy force in Hollywood. Max Thierot I don't really know this actor but he does a very nice job in the role of Ryan. Elizabeth Shue is also a very nice actress. This trio of actors did an exceptional job with the roles they were given. Lawrence does the snarky rebellious teenage role very well as well as the girl with a good heart and the will to help others. Thierot plays the quiet repressed outcast with a dark secret very convincingly. He isn't creepy but he isn't dull and boring. Shue plays the clich overprotective mother which may be my only issue with the movie who only wants what's best for her daughter and blah blah blah.Now the twist. Most people called it ahead of time Ryan is the killer. Now I know that it was pretty obvious from the getgo that he was the killer but that wasn't the twist. The twist was that CarrieAnn died after falling on the swings Ryan's parents made him CarrieAnn to deal with their grief Ryan killed his parents after their abuse had gone too far blamed himself for his sister's death and then when he got older moved back to his house kidnapped a girl and made her his CarrieAnn because he needs her in his life. When CarrieAnn escapes she seeks help but Ryan stops her. Onscreen we are convinced Ryan is keeping his demented sister from killing anyone but he just doesn't want people to know his secret. When she escapes again he accidentally kills her. We now believe that CarrieAnn is dead.While Ryan is keeping his secret Elissa tries to get closer to him much to her mother's dismay cliche again. She enters a Battle of the Bands competition and invites Ryan to come but his car gets trashed and then he gets beaten up until he retaliates and breaks a dudes leg he's not too important to the story and the rest of the bullies go to try and burn Ryan's house down but Elissa gets there in time to put out the fire. The last I wanna say 30 minutes of the film involve Elissa trying to get away from Ryan after discovering his secret and the truth about him. After defeating Ryan Elissa and Sarah move from their new house while Ryan is in a mental institution where he is haunted by his family's abuse towards him after CarrieAnn died. EndThis movie just like Cabin in the Woods focuses on the clichs of horror movies but doesn't necessarily attack them. Great acting and great story. People compare this to Psycho and Sleepaway Camp but I haven't seen those movies. I liked this movie and I really don't care what people have to negatively say about this movie. I recommend you go see it. It's not a waste of time or money. Don't listen to the dickholes!1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the perfect example why you should never attend horror movies rated PG13. The 'horror' factor is so watered down in order to appease the younger targeted audience market that the film becomes totally unpalatable to the true horror aficionados. This film is no exception it's truly an unbearable journey into the pseudo macabre with ridiculous situations intentionally orchestrated to place the film's main protagonist into absurd predicaments.The opening sequence of this film was original enough where the audience witnesses the brutal homicide of a husband and wife at the hands of their mentally deranged daughter. We later find out that the daughter was never seen again after the vicious attack on her parents. The film jumps ahead four years later where Elisabeth Shue Sarah and her daughter Elissa played by Jennifer Lawrence are moving next door the house of the heinous crime. Sarah Shue actually states that the only reason that they are able to afford such luxurious accommodations is the house's proximity to the police crime scene. However unbeknownst to Sarah the next door house is not empty. It seems that the massacred family had one lone surviving member Ryan Max Thieriot the eldest son. Ryan after being sent to live with his aunt has returned to his family's only remaining asset to fix any repairs and sell the family domicile for any cash that he can garner. As in any adolescence dramahorror flick Elissa is drawn to the pain and anguish that Ryan is exhibiting. When Sarah Shue forbids Elissa from continuing to see Ryan the teenage is further drawn to Ryan's despair. However guess what?? Ryan has a deep dark secret..Ryan's secret is revealed at the film's climax a secret so ludicrous and completely asinine that everything following the film's reveal is basically too preposterous to continue to even watch this film. A flashback to a childhood accident further exacerbates this conundrum. This film is really bad and I mean bad awful!!! Horrible acting horrendous plot atrocious dialogue and a farcical premise I cannot recommend this film not even home for home viewing. All in all this is a terrible film. It would be best to avoid this one if you know what's good for you.".

I thought we were better than this.Jennifer Lawrence who woefully deserves better than this film withheld by its own cardboard limitations plays Ellissa a teenager who has just moved into a rural home with her mother Sarah Elisabeth Shue on a block that holds many secrets.

Here it's again another endurance test at the audience's expense how long can you watch something scary happen to someone you really do not care about? That's the tragedy with films like these they never include substantial character development to make the journey with these characters more believable sympathetically involving or even interesting. You're stripped of any and all feeling watching these characters waltz around a premise of meager proportions.So this Ryan kid begins to become a little oppressive in his neediness and the fact that he is taking care of what we believe is his sister locked away in the basement cellar. It isn't long before he starts to taunt poor Elissa in ways that lack genuine suspense and craft. Gritty atmosphere long shots of dirty basements and some overly obnoxious jump scenes exist in place of actual credible suspense. That's all you get. No blood no terror and no satisfaction. Just redundancy and lackluster PG13fare.Jennifer Lawrence is immensely capable. It seems like yesterday we saw her in Winter's Bone a quietly pleasant film about the unpleasant and she did a wonderful job elevating the relatively underwhelming adventure film The Hunger Games. Here we can see how confined she is to deadend clichs cockamamie plot twists and how embarrassed she is to have her named attached to uninspired genre schlock like this. Whether it's that or the fact that the marketing campaign was reduced to blink and you miss it type ads House at the End of the Street isn't the least bit satisfying or memorable.Starring Jennifer Lawrence Max Thieriot Elisabeth Shue Gil Bellows and Eva Link.

Then of course there's a catch since the place will probably be part of a crime scene or the perfect confluence for the supernatural to come together to celebrate Halloween every night. The buyers themselves are either folks who are writers looking for inspiration or turn out to be those looking to put behind their emotional baggage for a new life ahead. You will probably run out of fingers to count the number of movies made from the same mold in recent years.Then you'll soon realize that the clichs in the film are tremendous from throwaway cops torchlights that don't work to creepy neighbours who are more than meets the eye. You may decide to be gung ho about it or to spare it some precious time for that glimmer of hope that it'll turn out to be fairly entertaining for what it's worth but you'll find that trust betrayed with each long drawn out dramatic scene that tries to add some depth to the characters but ended up turning the narrative into a long winded one with throwaway caricatures you don't really care much for. And the lapses into jump cuts that try so hard to provide some cheap scares just make things a lot worse.The other word of caution is that Jonathan Mostow was slated to writedirect this some 10 years ago but now have handed over this project to director Mark Tonderai and writer David Loucka to come and salvage something from it. Perhaps the only saving grace comes from a somewhat star lister in Jennifer Lawrence having made her name in XMen First Class and spearheading The Hunger Games most recently but even then the filmmakers failed to make it count where it mattered preferring to rely on her many cleavage baring tight tank tops to try and make a point not.Elizabeth Shue and Jennifer Lawrence star as motherdaughter Sarah and Elissa who find themselves a nice abode in the middle of the woods of a small town where the townsfolk aren't all that keen that their new neighbours had moved in next to a house that bore witness to two killings which the prologue introduces us to. Soon Elissa finds herself drawn to the sole survivor of that massacre in Ryan Max Thieriot despite her mother's objections and we're left wondering if the aloof Ryan is really a real Boo Radley type who is much maligned by everyone else or is actually hiding something a lot more sinister especially when it had to do with his supposedly missing sister Carrie Anne Eva Link accused of murdering their parents in cold blood.Movie goers will probably be able to stay multiple steps ahead of this insipid storyline if only they can stay awake for the first hour where the movie decided to go all over the place in showing how Sarah and Elissa try to fit in to their new environment in school and at the hospital making friends with the police and teenage peers for a rock concert that doesn't materialize because a modestly budgeted film will not allow for one. Things start to turn a wee bit interesting when Ryan enters the picture with red herrings and suggestions thrown about at will but only if given time to properly gestate into a proper back story or sub plot. Instead these potential ideas got quickly glossed over coupled with a ridiculous ending that sees a desperate epilogue thrown in to salvage some points. That didn't work because instead of being smart it turned out to be way too silly and ridiculous.Still this is something Jennifer Lawrence's fans will flock to in order to see their heroine in kicking butt. Watch out though for Max Thieriot's performance which given a proper script could really get under your skin as genuinely creepy.".

	schema:headline " A magical European adventure that is too real to brand a cartoon. A visual splendor  the imagination of an artist unequaled in the animation world.";
	schema:reviewBody "Over the decades Japan has established itself in the animation scene as a contender creating some of the most mind boggling realistic detailed animation the world has ever seen. However Japan had primarily made cartoons involving their traditional cultural and supernatural themes that the world felt alienated to.It wasn't until a great artist came along in the mid1970s that was to make Disney look like a second class citizen in the animation business. Hayao Miyazaki was Japan's inspiration to open their eyes to new horizons and show the world their hand in art. His first motion picture released in the late 70s was Lupin III Castle of Cagliostro which proved to be a world success. From that point on he created some of the most memorable brilliant and detailed masterpieces the western world ever saw  most having something to do with world issues and human's spiritual touch with nature. It wasn't until I saw Porco Rosso that I found my oasis in animation a film that has no reason to be a cartoon due to its sheer realism and setting.The premise is simple subtle and imaginatively compelling. The story follows a humanoid pig known as Porco Rosso 'Crimson Pig' in English Translation a bush pilot during the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s when Mussolini was a strong ally with Hitler. Whilst war is on the brink of initiation Bush Pilot 'Pirates' roam the Italian coast robbing ships tourists and living the life few people could experience. Among these gambling thieving dirty pirates however Porco Rosso stands as the ace pilot and feared by all. As he threatens the welfare of all the pirates particularly the Mamma Aiuto Gang the price on his head sky rockets. The only thing that lies between him and the pirates is a beautiful woman named Madame Gina the singer and proprietor of an island resort popular with all the pilots that come through. Gina loves Porco since childhood when he was a real human and cannot bare to lose yet another close one like her previous husbands. Both Porco's and Gina's world is turned upside down when an American ace pilot named Curtis intrudes into their lives insisting on making a name for himself as he plans to fight Porco in an air battle all the while falling in love with Gina.......the American way.Porco's subsequent adventures lead him to discover something about himself about those important to him and about letting go of his constant turmoil and guilt of events that have haunted him for years as he meets new characters that open his eyes and return him to what he once was.........just a human.Rarily has an adventure movie been so fun rich and captivating as Porco Rosso in addition to its overwhelmingly brilliant animation. Like I said before there is no reason for this film to be a cartoon but because it is and because it was realized in the way that it was this is what makes it a masterpiece among World Animation.The story being very simple could be taken on many levels with its inner meaning and symbolism. You forget that you are watching a cartoon after 5 minutes. It takes itself mildly seriously and the comic relief is timed to perfection. The characters vividly come to life and drain you of your emotions with each of their stories. The world Hayao Miyazaki creates is so real that you are inevitably drawn into it. The magnificent romantic and exotic music and attention to authenticity make the film's atmosphere so convincing and breathtaking  the music always suiting at the right moments. I hardly believed this was a Japanese film considering it felt completely like a European production. But no only Hayao Miyazaki could accomplish such feats as to utilize your imagination and transport you to another world without any reference to his origins. That is his gift. This was evident ever since his motion picture debut. He has made many brilliant films but Porco Rosso is the black sheep in the crowd. It is like something he's never done before as all his films were supernatural in many ways.This is my favorite cartoon of all time and one of the great motion pictures you're bound to ever come across in world cinema. Forget about Disney. If you love animation and film go no further than Hayao Miyazaki one of the last great directors and story tellers in a world which has forgotten quality. Disney died a long time ago and Miyazaki is a director in the old tradition  a tradition where plot and characters meant much more than special effects. Porco Rosso is an escape you'll come back to often. Few films have captured the essence of Europe Flying and Adventure quite like it. It lifts your spirits and inspires you to see the world in a different way. The beautiful mix of music color animation detail and setting make this a most unforgettable experience. 'Porco Rosso' is the definitive work from the legend of modern animation Hayao Miyazaki.".

From that point on he created some of the most memorable brilliant and detailed masterpieces the western world ever saw  most having something to do with world issues and human's spiritual touch with nature. It wasn't until I saw Porco Rosso that I found my oasis in animation a film that has no reason to be a cartoon due to its sheer realism and setting.The premise is simple subtle and imaginatively compelling. The story follows a humanoid pig known as Porco Rosso 'Crimson Pig' in English Translation a bush pilot during the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s when Mussolini was a strong ally with Hitler. Whilst war is on the brink of initiation Bush Pilot 'Pirates' roam the Italian coast robbing ships tourists and living the life few people could experience. Among these gambling thieving dirty pirates however Porco Rosso stands as the ace pilot and feared by all. As he threatens the welfare of all the pirates particularly the Mamma Aiuto Gang the price on his head sky rockets. The only thing that lies between him and the pirates is a beautiful woman named Madame Gina the singer and proprietor of an island resort popular with all the pilots that come through. Gina loves Porco since childhood when he was a real human and cannot bare to lose yet another close one like her previous husbands. Both Porco's and Gina's world is turned upside down when an American ace pilot named Curtis intrudes into their lives insisting on making a name for himself as he plans to fight Porco in an air battle all the while falling in love with Gina.......the American way.Porco's subsequent adventures lead him to discover something about himself about those important to him and about letting go of his constant turmoil and guilt of events that have haunted him for years as he meets new characters that open his eyes and return him to what he once was.........just a human.Rarily has an adventure movie been so fun rich and captivating as Porco Rosso in addition to its overwhelmingly brilliant animation. Like I said before there is no reason for this film to be a cartoon but because it is and because it was realized in the way that it was this is what makes it a masterpiece among World Animation.The story being very simple could be taken on many levels with its inner meaning and symbolism. You forget that you are watching a cartoon after 5 minutes. It takes itself mildly seriously and the comic relief is timed to perfection. The characters vividly come to life and drain you of your emotions with each of their stories. The world Hayao Miyazaki creates is so real that you are inevitably drawn into it. The magnificent romantic and exotic music and attention to authenticity make the film's atmosphere so convincing and breathtaking  the music always suiting at the right moments. I hardly believed this was a Japanese film considering it felt completely like a European production. But no only Hayao Miyazaki could accomplish such feats as to utilize your imagination and transport you to another world without any reference to his origins. That is his gift. This was evident ever since his motion picture debut. He has made many brilliant films but Porco Rosso is the black sheep in the crowd. It is like something he's never done before as all his films were supernatural in many ways.This is my favorite cartoon of all time and one of the great motion pictures you're bound to ever come across in world cinema. Forget about Disney. If you love animation and film go no further than Hayao Miyazaki one of the last great directors and story tellers in a world which has forgotten quality. Disney died a long time ago and Miyazaki is a director in the old tradition  a tradition where plot and characters meant much more than special effects. Porco Rosso is an escape you'll come back to often. Few films have captured the essence of Europe Flying and Adventure quite like it. It lifts your spirits and inspires you to see the world in a different way. The beautiful mix of music color animation detail and setting make this a most unforgettable experience. 'Porco Rosso' is the definitive work from the legend of modern animation Hayao Miyazaki.";

Susan Egan is the voice of Madame Gina Porco's friend who loves him but he doesn't quite get it. Cary Elwes who is of course British does a convincing Southern accent as the movie's main villain Curtis a hotshot American pilot who challenges Porco.

	schema:headline " When Pigs Fly";
	schema:reviewBody "Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few Japanese animators to be fully embraced by mainstream Western audiences perhaps because he is a giant europhile thoroughly fond of European culture architecture art and food.No surprise then that Porco Rosso is heavily influenced by 193040s British American and French adventure comics Popular Flying Battlefield Action Frontline Combat etc all of which served up exciting tales set in Europe often with soldiers as heroes. A large subset of these comics focused solely on fighter pilots The Red Baron James Bigglesworth The White Fokker romanticised knights of the skies gallant brave and chivalrous. As the war drew to a close and film noirs became popular the prim and proper aviation hero got a little bit scuffed up. He was now not only a total ace but a suave ladies man moody loner and cynic.And so Porco Rosso takes the best from these early wartime adventures and collides them with Humprey Bogart noirs Michael Curtiz flicks Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death and Miyazaki's own obsessions all to create a kind of ultra romantic cocktail. The setting a fantastical version of 1920's Italy in which the skies are ruled by heroic seaplane pilots bountyhunters and pirates. When they're not dodging tracers and dancing in the skies these hotshot fly boys hang out at Gina's island caf where they kick back relax and listen to Gina sing sad tunes of lovers long lost. Here like Rick's Bar in Casablanca there's an unwritten truce between all men. You may be enemies in the clouds but on Gina's island everyone's your buddy.The film revolves around Porco Rosso Italian for the crimson pig a chubby pig dressed in a detective's trench coat and dark shades. He should be ridiculous but with his witty oneliners I'd rather be a pig than a fascist cool detachment political apathy and romantic distance comes across instead as Bogart with a snout. The guy's not just the coolest pilot in the Adriatic but a total ladies man women fawning over him despite his perpetual disinterest.Like most of Miyazaki's films the plot is barely told. What Miyazaki invests in is creating worlds. Moody spaces. And so we savour the film's postcard images of Croatian and Italian villages its lovingly drawn architecture Gina's cosy island chteau seemingly modelled on Rick's Bar in Casablanca gorgeous Adriatic inlets and coastlines beautiful landscape shots interesting machinery and Miyazaki's large cast of good natured friends and foes. Throw in master composer Joe Hisaishi's gorgeous score  romantic easygoing suggestive of the French Rivierra  and this film kills you with aesthetics.All of Miyazaki's other obsessions are here  flying EuropeanMediterreanean towns an aesthetic which suggests a fusion of time periods little girls airplanes airships Ozulike stilllife tableaux  except environmentalist preaching. The absence of this sermonising makes Porcco Rosso like Kiki's Delivery Service one of his most laidback films. It's less about plot than it's about ambiance and environment. What little plot there is is itself all suggestive suggested romances suggested pasts suggested futures.The film is packed with great scenes some of them resembling Carroll Ballard's Wind released the same year one film revolves around building a boat the other a plane. Beyond the film's dog fights and aerial battles you have Gina's wistful aching love for Porcco whom she affectionately calls by his human name Marco Gina's love made wise by age is mirrored to the young puppy love of a 17 year old girl. It's a weird interspecies love affair peppered with flashbacks reminiscent of Leone's A Fistfull of Dynamite.The film's beauty and the beast romance has led to much speculation as to why exactly Porcco is a pig. The film seems to say that Marco put a spell on himself he views himself as a pig as being unworthy of living and it is only gradually through the validation of others that he comes to realise that he's not all that bad.In terms of the flaws the film's villains are too idiotic. They're bumbling buffoons and their juvenility at times takes you out of the story. Incidentally many fans of the film wage fierce battles over which of the film's dub tracks is better. Purists prefer the Japanese track a few like the American track and many prefer the French. The French version in which Jean Reno plays Porcco is far better than the Japanese dub and even Miyazaki thinks so himself. Personally though I think Porcco Rosso is the only Miyazaki film in which the American or Disney dubbing is much better than the original Japanese voice acting. Here actor Michael Keaton plays Porcco mixing a little Bat Man pig and Bogart to great effect. Actress Susan Egan is also suitably classy as Gina.1010  For an alternate take on similar material see Mamoru Oshii's underrated The Sky Crawlers.".

A large subset of these comics focused solely on fighter pilots The Red Baron James Bigglesworth The White Fokker romanticised knights of the skies gallant brave and chivalrous. As the war drew to a close and film noirs became popular the prim and proper aviation hero got a little bit scuffed up. He was now not only a total ace but a suave ladies man moody loner and cynic.And so Porco Rosso takes the best from these early wartime adventures and collides them with Humprey Bogart noirs Michael Curtiz flicks Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death and Miyazaki's own obsessions all to create a kind of ultra romantic cocktail. The setting a fantastical version of 1920's Italy in which the skies are ruled by heroic seaplane pilots bountyhunters and pirates. When they're not dodging tracers and dancing in the skies these hotshot fly boys hang out at Gina's island caf where they kick back relax and listen to Gina sing sad tunes of lovers long lost. Here like Rick's Bar in Casablanca there's an unwritten truce between all men. You may be enemies in the clouds but on Gina's island everyone's your buddy.The film revolves around Porco Rosso Italian for the crimson pig a chubby pig dressed in a detective's trench coat and dark shades. He should be ridiculous but with his witty oneliners I'd rather be a pig than a fascist cool detachment political apathy and romantic distance comes across instead as Bogart with a snout. The guy's not just the coolest pilot in the Adriatic but a total ladies man women fawning over him despite his perpetual disinterest.Like most of Miyazaki's films the plot is barely told. What Miyazaki invests in is creating worlds. Moody spaces. And so we savour the film's postcard images of Croatian and Italian villages its lovingly drawn architecture Gina's cosy island chteau seemingly modelled on Rick's Bar in Casablanca gorgeous Adriatic inlets and coastlines beautiful landscape shots interesting machinery and Miyazaki's large cast of good natured friends and foes. Throw in master composer Joe Hisaishi's gorgeous score  romantic easygoing suggestive of the French Rivierra  and this film kills you with aesthetics.All of Miyazaki's other obsessions are here  flying EuropeanMediterreanean towns an aesthetic which suggests a fusion of time periods little girls airplanes airships Ozulike stilllife tableaux  except environmentalist preaching. The absence of this sermonising makes Porcco Rosso like Kiki's Delivery Service one of his most laidback films. It's less about plot than it's about ambiance and environment. What little plot there is is itself all suggestive suggested romances suggested pasts suggested futures.The film is packed with great scenes some of them resembling Carroll Ballard's Wind released the same year one film revolves around building a boat the other a plane. Beyond the film's dog fights and aerial battles you have Gina's wistful aching love for Porcco whom she affectionately calls by his human name Marco Gina's love made wise by age is mirrored to the young puppy love of a 17 year old girl. It's a weird interspecies love affair peppered with flashbacks reminiscent of Leone's A Fistfull of Dynamite.The film's beauty and the beast romance has led to much speculation as to why exactly Porcco is a pig. The film seems to say that Marco put a spell on himself he views himself as a pig as being unworthy of living and it is only gradually through the validation of others that he comes to realise that he's not all that bad.In terms of the flaws the film's villains are too idiotic. They're bumbling buffoons and their juvenility at times takes you out of the story. Incidentally many fans of the film wage fierce battles over which of the film's dub tracks is better. Purists prefer the Japanese track a few like the American track and many prefer the French. The French version in which Jean Reno plays Porcco is far better than the Japanese dub and even Miyazaki thinks so himself. Personally though I think Porcco Rosso is the only Miyazaki film in which the American or Disney dubbing is much better than the original Japanese voice acting. Here actor Michael Keaton plays Porcco mixing a little Bat Man pig and Bogart to great effect. Actress Susan Egan is also suitably classy as Gina.1010  For an alternate take on similar material see Mamoru Oshii's underrated The Sky Crawlers.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had been putting off watching Porco Rosso for quite some time. It wasn't so much that I was anticipating not liking it. Rather it was more a trepidation that while good Porco Rosso wouldn't quite measure up to the other Miyazaki films which I've loved.I should have known better.The simplicity of the cover and the description of the plot that I had in my mind were so much less than what Porco Rosso contains. The marketing advertising and so forth place emphasis on the struggle between Porco and the pirates of the Adriatic. The second point of plot typically mentioned is the curse that he has fallen under. In truth neither of these things form the real backbone of the story psychology is at the heart of this narrative.A film simply about a bounty hunter versus pirates could be a fine ride if executed in a way which stirs. However without the kind of psychological backdrop that we get in Porco's character it wouldn't be possible to really move the audience. What raises this story from simply engaging to stirring moving is our main characters' relationship to their individual and shared pasts. In a really clever way the film introduces this haunting aspect of the past not through the main character but through the character of Gina. Of a similar generation Gina introduces this idea during her first conversation with Porco where she receives news that her husband has been confirmed dead she seems unusually unemotional. As she expresses to Porco she has shed so many tears already that she finds she has no more left to give. The carnage of world war 1 and the vagaries of life in a world where fate can snatch love from us has left her emotionally drained.Where Gina is melancholy and stoic Porco broods and isolates. As the sole survivor of a battle where Gina's first husband died he feels personally responsible. This sort of survivor's guilt is reflected with his constant selfdeprecation constantly we see signs of him expressing a low sense of selfworth. He doesn't deny his skill as a pilot but what he does deny is that he is in any way a good guy. When Gina tells him that her husband didn't make it home alive he responds the good guys never do making explicit this contrast between himself and a good guy.His profession as a mercenary is almost ideal for his state. It allows him to pretend that he's only in it for the money while at the same time he has put himself in a position to do good works saving children defending the monied defenseless etc. He does have a sense of morality of course. We see this in his careful targeting of his opponents planes he always aims to cripple and shoot down never to kill the opposing pilot. It is difficult for him to see the evidence that we see however. We understand the regret he feels as a sign of his ethical standards he dismisses it out of hand. One imagines that for him that is a bareminimum rather than a characteristic that one can be proud of.The devices that film uses to achieve the character development of Porco can at times be a bit trite. The character of Fio is perhaps a bit too onthenose as the young idealist who unshackled by a painful past is able to help shake off some of the emotional armor that Porco has surrounded himself in. However Miyazaki saves the character by simply writing her as an intelligent brave young woman whom the audience can both respect and relate to. Even more intelligently although Fio develops an admiration for and a crush on Porco this thread isn't really developed. As a character Fio wouldn't really work as Porco's love interest. It would add on the additional clich of olderman youngerwoman and that would just take Miyazaki's use of common story devices too far.Gina is the more realistic love interest for Porco and just as a sense of feminism imbues the character of Fio so too does a sense of feminism shape Gina. Far from the virginwhore duality that infects so many female characters Gina is fully realized as a woman with hopes and desires losses and memories that make her an equal of Porco. She has been married and she has known love but this doesn't spoil her. Rather it has matured her.Even more impressively the relationship between Gino and Porco is based on friendship a friendship which goes back to happier times. How refreshing to see romance kindled in such a realistic way as compared to the constant barrage of films where characters either fall in love with each other for narrative convenience.As good as this movie is I suspect that its greatest impact can be felt on those who are struggling with the emotions of Gina and Porco. To struggle with one's past is no uncommon thing and those who are working to set aside feelings of loss and selfloathing will probably find the greatest amount of catharsis as Porco slowly comes to realize that he doesn't need to define himself as a pig any longer. Certainly only those who have run out of tears will be able to fully appreciate the emotional desolation the Gina describes.".

First of all the movie plays in the time frame after the rise of Fascism in Italy from 1922 on to before the second world war. There is a flashback scene playing in the World War I. In the end there is a time lapse and they mention World War II.Secondly the film is not a story about how a man got jinxed to be a pig. Marco having the appearance of a pig can be interpreted in different ways and is often used in word plays and ironic statements like better to be a pig than to be a Fascist. The reason why it was never explained is probably that it would be totally unnecessary or even harm the story including the grand finale. It is the great strength of this movie that it does not want to cover all the stories details but leaves in a very poetic way so much room for speculation and dreaming.The drawings are just beautiful in all of their details and animation and the music by the ever ingenious Joe Hisaishi surprises. While Hisaishi does take notes from European classical music it is surprising how he managed to fusion his particular style of music with the nostalgia of the twenties and Italian and Austrian or rather Dalmatian influences. This movie is an absolute masterpiece in story telling animation and music and is greatly underestimated. While other works of Ghibli might be cineastically great they serve completely different audiences. What makes Porco Rosso so outstanding is that it realistically gives us viewers strong emotions about bygone days that actually never existed in the way they had been depicted and thus sends a strong message to everyone about things we might want to preserve ideas of freedomsolitude guilt adventure and love that do actually exist.".

	schema:headline " An engaging and entertaining animation";
	schema:reviewBody "It is a time in the Mediterranean when sea planes still rule the skies and large areas are controlled by sky pirates who run raids and kidnapping on passing ships. The only saving grace of the area is bounty hunter Porco Rosso or The Crimson Pig who is famed for his speed and skill. Suffering under a curse that turned him from a man into a pig Rosso is the scourge of the pirates until they hire the services of American Curtis award winning race pilot. Their first skirmish sees Rosso defeated and feared dead but while Curtis gloats over his victory Rosso returns to Italy where his favourite mechanic lives despite the outstanding arrest warrants for him in that country.Thanks to FilmFour becoming the first freetoair film channel in the UK I was treated to a week of Miyazaki films most of which I hadn't seen before. Kurenai no buta was the first one I watched because it looked like it would be the most fun. The story is an enjoyable tale of a dog fighting pig that works well as an adventure while also having enough invention and character to make it more than just a lot of noise and colour for kids. The adventure aspect is good though and has plenty of classy ie not just silly and exaggerated action and children should be easily distracted. Although not that deep the film does have solid characters that have layers and humour. Rosso is a simple character perhaps but at least he is interesting and less obvious than most animated film leads. This made the film more engaging for me and meant that the film never dropped when the action was put on the backburner  in fact the strongest moments are humour and character based. Miyazaki directs with a great eye and unique style. The film is consistently visually impressive and although the setting limits the imagination it is still very much what it is.The English dub cast do a good job and for all the criticisms of Disney in their handling of these films credit to them for doing this right. Keaton makes for a good Rosso playing him gruff and seemingly uncaring which was the right direction to go. Characters like this don't really ever crack and so Keaton does well to hold back while only hinting at the humanity within his character. Elwes is nicely cheesy as Curtis and works well. Williams is really fun as Fio and she provided a lot of energy once she joined in certainly she was better than Egan who I found rather dull and unable to do much with her character. An unrecognisable Stiers makes for some nice comedy as master engineer Piccolo.Overall this was an enjoyable film. Perhaps not enough emotional depth to it to make it stand with Miyazaki's finest work but still a very engaging and entertaining family film with more than enough for children and a solid narrative and character foundation that will make it easy for adults to care about.".

	schema:headline " This movie will make you believe that pigs could indeed fly.";
	schema:reviewBody "This was indeed a beautiful film from Studio Ghibli. It had some really nearly perfect visuals some funny humor and interesting concept but there was a little something missing preventing it from being one of my favorites Hayao Miyazaki's films. Don't get me wrong I like this movie but I think this movie got under the hype that every Hayao Miyazaki film is supposed to be judge as good just because fans love 1988's My Neighbor Totoro so much. In my opinion this movie is kinda overrated. Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki the film was originally planned as a short inflight film for Japan Airlines based on Miyazaki's manga 'The Age of the Flying Boat' but grew into a featurelength film. The movie doesn't really have much of a plot and because of that the story kinda crash and burns. The plot somewhat revolves around an Italian curse World War I exfighter ace Marco Rousolini AKA Porco Rosso voiced by Shichir Moriyama in Japanese Michael Keaton in English whom became halfman halfpig after his compatriots were killed in battle. He is now a jaded womanizing bounty hunter rescuing ships and babies from the attacks of bumbling pirates across the Adriatic Sea. While this sumup sounds entertaining in truth the movie sadly has very little flying in it. It only has onemajor action set piece in the film. The movie depicts most of airplane battles as childish and silly. Lots of bullets are fired but nobody dies in this PG movie. Even airplane dogfight packed with innocent spectators on the ground doesn't have one victim. Tons of property damage ensues but somehow the stray gunfire only hits inanimate objects! Come on movie. Take more a risk. Sadly the movie never truly goes anywhere intense with its action. The odd collection of air pirates are more rivals than villains and their screwball antics are played for comedy. Most of the film has Porco repairing his ship with a female mechanic Flo Piccolo Voiced by Akemi Okamura in Japanese Kimberly WilliamsPaisley in English after being shot down by Donald Curtis Voiced by Akio tsuka in Japanese Cary Elwes in English a cocky American fighter pilot who joins forces with the pirates. He hopes to get payback against Curtis but the movie ignored that for most of the film to push the romantic overtures of both Flo  the cocktail singer Gina Voiced by Tokiko Kato in Japanese Susan Egan in English on him. We get it Porco must learn to be least misogyny towards women. In other words try not to be a pig. One of the film's biggest problems is the lack of emotional connection. Honestly all of Porco's relationships don't seem real. It all seem a bit forced and kinda bland. Most people will say the picture's best emotional scene is Porco's backstory of what happened to him in the war. I have to agree it was amazing. It is taken from a scene from Roald Dahl short story called They Shall Not Grow Old. Originally there are more be explained but most of the serious tone of WW1 had to scrap off the storyboard because of the Yugoslavian wars of the early 1990s due to it being set in Croatia. Another great scene is Porco watching a cartoon in a darken movie theater. The cartoon depicts a Mickey Mouse Expy striving to save his girlfriend from a villainous pig in an airplane. The obvious metaphor is clear. It's a great moment in the film as we see the pig as a symbol of a man's alienation loathing and despair. If you look deep in the film you might find themes of redemption loss and love to be very powerful in this underneath the more fun surface. Sadly it's not easy to find. The English voice acting is alright for the most part. Michael Keaton does a good job as Porco. He show the cynical side very well. Still I kinda like Jean Reno's French dubbing more as it was a little wellrounded performance. British actor Cary Elwes as American Curtis was mediocre at best. The Southern accent was bit odd. It's goes in and out throughout the film. It was really overthetop Errol Flynnism. Not his best work but it was watchable. The music to the film was amazing. Another masterpiece from composer Joe Hisaishi. The animation was OK for the time. Hand by hand drawings is hard to do and I just glad everything more so fluently. The only problem that I notice is that Flo looks very similar to Nausicaa from 1984's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind another Ghibli movie Miyazaki has a tendency to recycle character models and it shows here. I like how much the movie is a homage to early aviation. You really can tell that they did their research. The movie was very accurate with the planes designs. However there were some exaggerated. The end of the film was particularly unimpressive. I really hate that it ends abruptly and didn't resolve anything. Miyazaki has expressed interest in making a sequel. He plans to set it in the Spanish Civil War calling the film's working title Porco Rosso The Last Sortie. As of this writing the movie hasn't been made or look like it ever will be made. Still the movie did influence other works. One good example is Disney's TaleSpin TV show. Overall This movie is too silly to be taken seriously. Honestly this movie could have been amazing. It could had been probably one of Miyazaki's best works but with glaring plot holes frustrating romances and indecisive writing. It's not. Still it's a warm nostalgic fun film even if it doesn't quite fly high enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "I believe this was the first Studio Ghibli film I ever saw. I remember being blown away by the excellent story telling the animation and the general feeling of the whole thing. From then on I was hooked and made it a bit of a mission to see as many of them as I could. Well that's not hard when Film4 here in the UK has been showing a season of them for the last couple of weeks. I'll give you my thoughts on this particular offering after this brief summary.Porco Rosso is a pilot a bit of a hero from World War I who now makes a living as a bounty hunter. He tracks down the sea plane pirates who attack the ships on the Adriatic Coast a part of the Mediterranean. It is the 1920's and flying is what everyone wants to do. At a bar run by Gina who secretly loves him Porco meets an American fighter ace Curtis who has been hired by the pirates to take him out. But Porco has problems with his plane and has to take it to Milan to be repaired. Curtis follows him and shoots him down leaving him stranded. When he's picked up he makes it to Milan with what's left of his plane and has it rebuilt by Fio Pikkoro a seventeen year old girl who just happens to be a very talented engineer. When he returns Fio comes with him to make sure he pays his bill. Little does she know they're about to have another runin with the pirates and this time they're playing for keeps! I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police Animation Division will have me redrawn as some crazy animal again.Over the years I have become a bit of a fan of the work of Hayao Miyazaki he certainly knows how to make a movie that can take you away to another world for a couple of hours. Again this one is beautifully animated and I also loved the music by Joe Hisaishi it really evokes the era and stirs the emotions. I watched this one in Japanese with subtitles and I think that helps you to concentrate on the story. For those who fear the subtitle I believe a dubbed version is available. It's not really clear just who played who from the listings I've seen but I will give honourable mentions to the voice talents of Shichir Moriyama Tokiko Kat Tsunehiko Kamij and Akemi Okamura.I found this film beautifully made funny at times but also very touching when it needed to be. It certainly did what many of the Studio Ghibli films have done and that is entertain me! I must admit I feel lucky that I saw this one first others that don't quite hit the mark may have put me off. So it's got a bit of everything a flying pig some comedy a bit of a love story and pirates who could ask for more!? As you have probably guessed by now for me Definitely recommended.My score 8.410.IMDb Score 7.810 based on 16525 votes at the time of going to press.Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score 100100 based on 13 reviews counted at the time of going to press. Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score 60100 based on 40738 user ratings counted at the time of going to press.".

But Porco has problems with his plane and has to take it to Milan to be repaired. Curtis follows him and shoots him down leaving him stranded. When he's picked up he makes it to Milan with what's left of his plane and has it rebuilt by Fio Pikkoro a seventeen year old girl who just happens to be a very talented engineer. When he returns Fio comes with him to make sure he pays his bill. Little does she know they're about to have another runin with the pirates and this time they're playing for keeps! I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police Animation Division will have me redrawn as some crazy animal again.Over the years I have become a bit of a fan of the work of Hayao Miyazaki he certainly knows how to make a movie that can take you away to another world for a couple of hours. Again this one is beautifully animated and I also loved the music by Joe Hisaishi it really evokes the era and stirs the emotions. I watched this one in Japanese with subtitles and I think that helps you to concentrate on the story. For those who fear the subtitle I believe a dubbed version is available. It's not really clear just who played who from the listings I've seen but I will give honourable mentions to the voice talents of Shichir Moriyama Tokiko Kat Tsunehiko Kamij and Akemi Okamura.I found this film beautifully made funny at times but also very touching when it needed to be. It certainly did what many of the Studio Ghibli films have done and that is entertain me! I must admit I feel lucky that I saw this one first others that don't quite hit the mark may have put me off. So it's got a bit of everything a flying pig some comedy a bit of a love story and pirates who could ask for more!? As you have probably guessed by now for me Definitely recommended.My score 8.410.IMDb Score 7.810 based on 16525 votes at the time of going to press.Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score 100100 based on 13 reviews counted at the time of going to press. Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score 60100 based on 40738 user ratings counted at the time of going to press.";

	schema:reviewBody "I love Miyazaki movies. From the first movie i saw of his spirited away to the latest before this one castle of cagliostro i've loved them all. They all have an air about them that leaves you breathless and puts you in a great mood if you're feeling down never disappointing the audience... until this one.Now don't get me wrong. i didn't HATE this movie but at the same time it was not nearly his best. It still captures the spirit and life of a Miyazaki movie but at the same time has so many plot holes and frustrating things that you are taken out of the story and left complaining. and Miyazaki should NEVER do that.I found several problems with this movie. 1. They don't ever explain why he's a pig. now forgive me if i sound a bit prudish but um.. he's a pig. and no one questions it? Does that happen often or something in that world? I'm not confused by the fact that he IS a pig i'd just like to know WHY he's a pig and WHY nobody asks him about it. Halfway through the movie when Fio asks him to tell him a story i figure he was going to tell her why he's a pig but then he goes into a weird heaven story and you never find out. that frustrated me and there was no reason why they couldn't have spent 45 seconds telling us why. it's like in howl's moving castle if they started the movie with sophie already old and not telling us why. it was stupid and they could have rectified it easily2. it couldn't decide what age range it was. normally in a film if you can't tell what age range it's meant for that's the sign of a good movie bringing in both the kids and the older demographic. but in this film it was just frustrating. one scene it would be full of laughs and for kids the next it would be about death and going to heaven. it didn't flow seamlessly like Miyazaki does in his other films such as Castle in the sky. you know it's adult but at the same time keeps you happy. Porco just had odd juxtapositions that just don't make a whole lot of sense. the switches needed to flow better.3. The love interest. OK. this is one i didn't understand AT ALL. Gina the main love interest is about as interesting as a sack of wet leaves. She's boring has no personality or anything likable about her and she hardly does ANYTHING throughout the entire film. On the other hand the girl Fio travels with Porco for the entire movie. Saving his life placing herself up to wager for Porco's honor and eventually freeing him from the curse. and yet Porco ends up with miss wet leaves? that's just stupid. they spend so much time building the relationship between porco and fio and then dismissing it at the end? wow that's terrible. i'm not one to normally complain about there being a lack of love in movies but my god was the love resolution done terribly in this movie.4. The ending. for the resolution of this film we get stock footage of a cloud and a narration by fio. Telling us basically nothing. She becomes the owner of the garage the American is a star and porco mumbles off oh. thanks. yeah. god forbid we actually want to KNOW what happened at the end. This ending was tacked on lazy and the cheapest thing ever. it's like the ending to Fable the game. you stick with it to the end and you expect a big payoff and get slapped in the face. it was rushed and felt cheap. Miyazaki never does that and i was very surprised and disappointed he did it here.The voice acting animation and music are once again superb but it got more than a little messed up in the script department. If you need to see this to finish off your Miyazaki collection i'd say save this one for later rather than watch it now. and if you're trying to get someone into him don't start off with this one. i recommend Kiki's delivery service or for the adventure fans Castle in the Sky. The plot premise really was a very good one. It just needed a bit of tweaking and a few rewrites and it would have been amazing probably one of his best. But with glaring plot holes frustrating romances and indecisive writing Porco Rosso gets 5 aerial maneuvers out of 10.".

Genevieve Bujold has forever been underused and underrated and she is simply superb here. And while I wouldn't tarnish Hitchock's reputation by comparing Coma too closely to any of his work Crichton does a good job of maintaining suspense. I love the scene where Richard Widmark explains the crazy rationale behind it all and we see it through Bujold's drugaddled eyes which somehow makes it more palatable than if we were watching it straight.And I love all the cameos  Lois Chiles!

Set against a hospital backdrop ranking in verisimilitude with that of THE HOSPITAL the only other accurate medical drama of the 1970's this is a gripping thriller even on repeat viewing over twenty years later. Bujold's acting has been mentioned by other reviewers but I would award special accolades to Richard Widmark whose character's unctuous avuncularity is executed with superb subtlety. Plus he even comports himself just like a real physician of seniority.I do have a few complaints not least of which is the gratuitous and grossly inaccurate portrayal of clinical lab personnel and the laboratory environment. Shame on Crichton who must have missed out on visiting the lab through his entire tenure as a medical student. The laserdisc transfer is technically one of the worst I have in my collection. The monaural soundtrack is overdriven and distorted the colors are washed out and careless unmasking of the print COMA is not letterboxed results in visible boom mikes in several shots.Still this is a classic film and anyone who wants to get up to speed on medical movies wouldn't want to exclude COMA.".

If you think about the actors involved in that one you have to be impressed. And as another comment points out the chase scene that ends in the freezer room is excellent creepy and visceral.  The killer  who is really just a hit man for whoever is behind 'the conspiracy' is suitably athletic anonymous and menacing.  His sole line  They told me to make it look like an accident is extremely scary and effective  when coupled with his actions during the maintenance man scene.  Good writing Michael.

	schema:reviewBody "Not for those who fear the medical profession this creepy thriller takes it's time getting started but then kicks into high gear. It creates a mood and builds suspense to an almost unbearable degree. Elfin Bujold sporting a truly unappealing hairstyle is Dr. Susan Wheeler a principled dedicated intern at a major hospital. She begins to notice a disturbing trend...that folks with purportedly minor surgeries are not coming out of their operations conscious. From this point on it is virtually Bujold against the world as a gallery of sexist condescending doctors including her own lover Douglas tries to poopoo her findings or encourage her to lay off. Naturally she can't leave well enough alone and is soon up to her ears in intrigue and violence. The film has a blatantly frank point of view. People eat sandwiches while they are examining cadavers. Brains are sliced like deli meat. It's all very clinical and unsettling to nonmedical viewers. There are several highlycharged moments including a duct hole exploration and a chase through a seemingly abandoned hospital. Jerry Goldsmith's clanking score doesn't take center stage until late in the film but is wonderfully nervewracking when it needs to be. Bujold and the Chief of Staff Widmark make wonderful counterparts as they come from different generations and different eras of medicine. Best of all is the brief but unforgettable appearance of Ashley as the world's most intimidating nurse. In her opening scene she blinks exactly once! Her voice is a monotone terror and her stare is up there with Medusa's. The section that contains her is surreal but arresting and very campy! Adding to the fun is a series of small appearances by people like Torn Chiles Selleck and Harris. This is a frightening film with some memorable imagery and a startling amount of skin for a PG film.".

By the cover it had all the elements for a great movie and the movie brought no disappointment.  It was absolutely intriguing and brilliantly filmed. The background of the cold sterile hospital was haunting and perfect.  Each actor whether big or small brought a twist to the story.  The main character who played Dr. Susan Wheeler was perfect as the stern and cold Doctor who's best friend goes in for a routine operation and then is rendered into a mysterious brain dead Coma.  Dr. Wheeler begins to notice strange coincidences around the hospital and starts to investigate other Coma cases.  What she unravels is a top secret plot that goes right to the very top.  The story unravels perfectly and the tension and clues are superb. You can't get a much better 2 hour movie.  It's definately a movie that you might be tempted to pass by but it's worth renting.  Michael Douglas is even great although only in it as a supporting character as Dr. Wheeler's Doctor boyfriend who she tries to convince something terrible is going on within the hospital.  You never know who might be involved in this plot and you're waiting for it all to unravel.  The only negative aspect of this movie was the ending happens very very quickly kind of leaves you feeling a little hurried but still an first class movie.  Also look for Tom Selleck portraying a patientdead body.  You can't go wrong with this movie. 810".

Underneath the riveting suspense this is really a sneaky feministtype film.I really like the way we can never be sure about Douglas. Sometimes he's helpful and affectionate but then there are the darker fleeting moments that add a good unsettling note. At the same time the great Richard Widmark Dr. Harris is suavely slimy as the head doctor. And what about that Jefferson Institute.

It opens with a really intriguing shot of a gorgeous Genevieve Bujold driving to her work as a Dr. Wheeler and listening to the radio on a beautiful crisp Boston morning. A film like this has the audience attention from that grab. Exposition ensues and so does a bit of crazy character development. Then something else happens a major death takes place and a real intrigue seeks in. Then the revelation is that a crisis is concerning certain patients. Not for those who are queasy in hospitals. This film about patients slipping one by one into a coma for no apparent reason still has enough affect to chill every one of it's audience members to the bone! All the stars are at their best with a script thatwhile has some of its unoticable flaws keeps the audience in the roots of fear as they root for the lead female. Great Jerry Goldsmith score as well. Great photography and direction from Crighton. a cool film!".

	schema:reviewBody "Coma as well as other midtolate 70's films was one of the reasons I became a filmmaker myself.  In terms of the suspence tension and general spookiness of such a normal and everyday subject as hospitals doctors etc. was very influential in how I perceived the things around me.  The great thing about the film and the book  of course was that we put our trust in people like doctors policemen goverment officials and the like  and most of the time that trust is blind faith.  Dr. Cook and DR. Crichton are masters at this genre  Making the incredible credible.  Even though this film is a bit dated It is almost becoming a reality.  In China prisoners are harvested for their organs so others can benefit. Technology like in the film can now sustain life for as long as the machines andor computers can function.  It was SciFi in 1978  now an alltoreal reality.  Back to the film itself I thought Dr. Crichton did a wonderful job on the directing and the screenplay.  The material he had from Dr. Cook was firstrate.  The cinematography done by A.S.C. President Victor J. Kemper was outstanding.  The technique of keeping the images at the hospital as cold sterile and clinical as possible was brilliant.  Mr. Hirschfield's Jefferson Institute sequences were also fantastic.  Dr. Crichton's editing pace was also a stroke of genius.  All editing was done with straight cuts.  No zooms and very few dolly pan shots.  This was keep with the theme that YOU THE VIEWER are in the hospital and the cuts are as impersonal and precise as the doctor's scalpel.  The cast was also well thought out.  Ms. Bujold even though she speaks with a thick FrenchCanadian accent was the perfect protagonist.  You do not have to be an Amazon Woman to be strong and independent.  Mr. Douglas was a bit sleepy in his role he just needed more to do.  Mr. Widmark was perfect as the Chief as was Mrs. Ashley as the Institute's head matron.  Look for Tom Selleck and Ed Harris in their first movie roles.  Also in the Jefferson Institute sequence you will see a young Christopher Reeve as a hapless victem of the movie's plot.  All in all Coma is one of those films that even though had moderate success at the box office is really a forgotten gem in the MGM vaults.  It proves that you do not need blood guts or special effects to make a great movie.  Gee kind of like Mr. Hitchcock.".

Such that upon reviewing 20 years later certain scenes trigger memories and almost puts me back into that couch as a 78 year old. Another of those movies is the weird early science fiction movie by George Lucas of which the title escapes me right now.In Coma it was in particular the image of the Jefferson Institute building that recalled an evening somewhere in the late '70s. There's probably no movie featuring a more effective and suggestive modernstyle horror house. For me the Jefferson Institute complex perfectly impersonates and clenches the feeling that this intelligent thriller is trying to get accross. By its architecture and desertedness it suggests sterility impersonality loneliness and the feeling of an industrial complex. The sterility of a medical system that does well in the technical aspect but features a growing impersonality that makes it miss its primary goal to make people feel good. The loneliness of Bujold who is rather assumed by everyone to be paranoid than to be believed even by her boyfriend. And the industrial feeling of a healthcare system that doesn't exist to cure people but to keep itself alive as an industry profitable.With the arrival of sophisticated genetic techniques the medical horror genre is bound to return soon to the big screen.

Unlike those rousing crowdpleasing adventure yarns COMA is a film which works on subtlety building up a level of quiet suspense unseen in all but 5 of such wouldbe films. Yes this is great stuff with tons of atmosphere and suspense great acting from the entire cast and a large complicated yet easy to follow plot with farreaching implications. There are so many great scenes in COMA that it's hard to keep track of them. There's a wonderful stalking sequence in which Bujold finds herself being chased by a murderous mystery man which makes the best use of a hospital I've yet to see in a movie  forget the gory boring HALLOWEEN 2 this is the real stuff and with not a drop of blood to be seen. There's also a really nailbiting climax which had me on the edge of my seat  something which only a small handful of films are capable of doing.Following in the footsteps of other '70s conspiracy films like THE CONVERSATION COMA lets the plot unfold at a slow pace building up pieces of a jigsaw until it all falls into place with a horrific clarity. Genevieve Bujold is excellent as the smart and sexy young doctor who acts as the eyes and ears of the audience as we follow her journey and never get ahead of her in her investigation. The camerawork and music is also great with fine locations the Jefferson building couldn't look more sinister and some excellent visuals like the famous shot of the comatose bodies suspended from wires in a warehouse. The action setpieces are well handled and stick in the mind like the murder of the janitor for instance which has the best on screen death by electrocution I've seen.Bujold is supported by a familiar cast of old and new faces all of whom put in fine turns. Michael Douglas is the misunderstood boyfriend who helps Bujold in her research while Richard Widmark has the fun role of the evil mastermind don't worry it doesn't take much to work that out behind the illegal organ donation scheme. The rest of the cast includes Tom Selleck as a victim Rip Torn as a doctor and a chilling turn from the guy playing the hired killer it's a shame I don't know the actor as I'd keep an eye out for him. COMA takes the audience on an epic journey is gripping at all times and simply one of the best conspiracythrillers out there. 100 recommended.".

The rest of the cast includes Tom Selleck as a victim Rip Torn as a doctor and a chilling turn from the guy playing the hired killer it's a shame I don't know the actor as I'd keep an eye out for him. COMA takes the audience on an epic journey is gripping at all times and simply one of the best conspiracythrillers out there. 100 recommended.";

Scenes such as Susan being shown round the Jefferson Institute and encountering dozens of bodies suspended in midair are horrifying to this day. When an assassin follows her into a room full of verticallystored corpses she pushes them and they topple on top of him like falling dominoes. The suspense is highlighted by a typically brilliant Jerry Goldsmith score.Things To Look Out For  one of the doomed patients is a young Tom Selleck  future 'Magnum P.I.' .Film versions of books are often inferior but 'Coma' does not dumb down the story.

Of course one can never follow a novel completely since what can be conveyed to the minutest detail in a 600 page novel definitely cannot be packed in a two hour movie. But still when you do not miss out the essential aspects of the movie only then can you satisfy those who have read the novel. Coma is one of the fine examples of how a movie can be made out of a good novel.Coma is based on the novel of the same name by Robin Cook. Robin Cook being a man of medicine himself is able to present to us with great amount of realism as to how the profession of medicine can be used for commercial selfish gains. Most of his novels are set in a premise where the men of medicine are misusing their powers in order to gain wealth. The story of Coma is about a hospital where something suspicious is going on as discovered by our lead character  Dr. Susan Wheeler.The movie then shows how her suspicions prove to be right but she gradually discovers the complexity of the plot and is then faced with a dilemma as to who can be trusted and who cannot be trusted. The best part of the movie as is the best part of the novel is that it works in a smooth flow and makes us believe that what is being depicted is a surreal possibility and who knows  somewhere in world it just might be the truth.For a movie that is made in 1976 the direction screening and scripting is simply beautiful. It keeps us on the edge of our seats and gives our gray cells plenty of exercise as they try and anticipate as to what is going to happen next. The whole cast does a wonderful job in creating a movie that will for me remain one of the most defining movies in the genre best described as medical thrillers'.".

'Coma' has no time for this cheap trickery and creates genuine suspense by filming the stalking of Ms Bujold in the brightly lit but deserted corridors of a hospital. An atmosphere of danger and menace pervades the entire film and one is left with uncomfortable feeling that perhaps the trade in human organs for wealthy recipients may actually be going on somewhere.

The hero is a heroine a doctor at a major Boston hospital. The actress is French Canadian Genevieve Bujold a slight but strong character one of the first of the admirable women leads in movies in the New Hollywood and feminist aftermath thankfully. In truth she is admirable if sometimes stubbornly solitary in her pursuit of the evil she has uncovered at work.And that evil is a series of unexpected comas in young patients including her best friend who has gone in for an abortion in this Roe v. Wade era under the guise of a less politically loaded procedure. This leads to more sensational aspects that I leave to you to uncover.By her side either for her or against her you can't tell after awhile are two huge Hollywood names an aging Richard Widmark as the head of the hospital and a young Michael Douglas as another up and coming surgeon and Bujold's lover. The politics as well as the medical ethics get increasingly mixed up in sensational trashy novel style which is exactly what this kind of movie needs. It's fun quasirealistic interestingly speculative and overall well made.Yes well made and well directed. Crichton pulls of his second full Hollywood production off with conviction. It feels like a routine well made Hollywood movie from 1978it would have been terrific at a good drivein and it's great at home too. Just to be sure the movies at the time that were more inventive and impressive included Deer Hunter and Midnight Express to name just two. And in its own way this tries to touch on an explosive idea at the time beyond the casual abortion aspect which is the dignity of life and the black market in body organs. It's all better than we have a right to expect if you don't expect too much!".

The second is unfortunately the film came out in the wake of The High and the Mighty. Most airplane pictures suffer in comparison to that one.Not mind you that it could have been given better productions values. Color for the jungle scenes and maybe some location shooting instead of dusting off the same sets used for Five Came Back for that matter for King Kong. Remember RKO was owned by one of aviation's biggest boosters in Howard Hughes. Not that he couldn't have afforded some better productions values. But then again he was getting out of the film business at this time. Then again had he put some money into it we also would have had more Hughes control and the results might have been interesting. Not necessarily good but interesting.That being said the cast does a fine job for director John Farrow. Like John Wayne in The High and the Mighty Robert Ryan is fine as the able veteran airline pilot in charge of getting his passengers and crew back to safety after they've force landed in the South American jungle. Of course with the pulchritudinous Anita Ekberg on board and interested that's enough to give anyone a morale booster. Rod Steiger plays the criminal on the way to his execution a part done by Joseph Calleia in the original. Both are fine and are an interesting contrast in acting styles.John Farrow added a few things here that were not in the original. One of the dumber things added was a chick fight between Phyllis Kirk and Anita Ekberg while they are stranded in the jungle. I mean was that really necessary John? Added nothing to the plot and kind of stupid when you come to think about it.Still chick fight and all Back from Eternity is a good solid piece of entertainment that also asks some important questions about the quality of life collectively and the quality of how one spends his allotted time on earth.".

They must stay alive until the plane is repaired a task complicated by the realization that they are surrounded by a hostile tribe of headhunters.Here you have Robert Ryan instead of Chester Morris Rod Steiger instead of Joseph Calleia and Gene Barry instead of Patric Knowles. Ryan and Steiger especially in the main roles display more screen presence and acting talent in this one film than their predecessors were able to conjure up in their entire careers.Ryan plays the worldweary pilot another of his sturdy and dependable performances which are often overlooked and not fully appreciated because he made it seem so effortless. Steiger has the more colorful role as the anarchist with only imprisonment and execution waiting for him if and when they make it back to civilization. The same talent which would gain an Oscar for the actor some ten years later is clearly evident here.The underrated Keith Andes as the copilot instead of forgettable Kent Taylor gives a hint of the star he could have become and the equally underrated Phyllis Kirk is far more effective in her role than whoever played it in the original. Barry usually cast as a good guy gives a good account of himself playing Kirk's fiance. Whereas most of the other passengers rise to the occasion his character becomes increasingly desperate grasping and unstable.Anita Ekberg frequently dismissed as an actress may not have been as talented as Lucille Ball who played the part in the original but at least proved that she could indeed act and is certainly more convincing in this type of role than Lucy was.Of note is a preLassie Jon Provost as the little boy. Jesse White better known for his work in comedic films does a fine job as the boy's roughhewn guardian and Fred Clark is good at giving a distasteful stamp to the rather seedy cop. Above all Cameron Prudhomme and Beulah Bondi as the old professor and his mrs. give two very moving heartfelt performances.The story concerns the characters' survival how each holds up under the pressure and are changed by the situation. Steiger begins to rediscover some of the values of his youth but then finally takes it upon himself to decide who will live and who will die when it is learned that some must stay behind. The conclusion builds to a shattering climax that will stay with you long after the film ends. This is the remake to see and it is definitely worth seeing.".

The movie sets you up for what is about to happen and then plunges you full throttle into the story. It is every bit as entertaining and full of drama as the later Airport movies of the 1970's. In fact in many ways this is much better. It is very fun to see Jesse White in a role other than the Maytag repair man. The same can be said for actors Fred Clark Jon Provost Gene Barry and the rest who were more famous for other roles. You have to love  Rod Steiger's character. He is definitely the most interesting in the movie. It is a nice little movie in character studies and how they deal with a forced landing in a jungle clearing with a cannibal tribe nearby. This movie stacks up to the airport and other flight disaster movies quite well. I first saw this as a teenager and I never forgot it especially when the decision had to be made to see who stayed behind and especially who made the decision. For this being a B movie it is still very first rate and gets an A in viewing pleasure.".

The story revolves around a plane crash in the remote jungles of South America. The pilot declares he is able to repair the plane and it will fly some of them back to safety the problem being there is only room for 5 people on board the repaired vessel which means some will have to stay behind and take their chances with the inhospitable terrain and the hostile natives who are unhappy about this incursion into their domain .

	schema:reviewBody "I classify Back From Eternity John Farrow's remake of Five Came Back as a 'stunt' film. This is because it isolates human beings for the purpose of analyzing a range of character types instead of connecting them to a larger world of potentials. The original filmed version of this interesting story was shorter and more direct the attempt by John Farrow and his writers in 1956 was to turn a firstrate adventure film into a dramatic one and they nearly succeeded by my standards. The problem in the remake I suggest lies in the writers having turned the lead Bill played by Robert Ryan into a man who cannot be trusted not to drink alcohol even though he is a pilot. This problem with the ethical central character otherwise a man of great ability and experience makes the man played by Ryan who lacks the charisma of his second Joe Brooks played by the immenselypowerful Keith Andes decidedly inferior to his second in voltage interest and ethical consistency. Some of the other casting that of sexsymbol nonactress Anita Ekberg as a saloon girl and Rod Steiger doing a partiallyunsuccessful foreign accent makes the actors and their parts less acceptable than they deserve to be. Many actors in this film do admirable work and it is a filmed narrative filled I believe with wonderful scenes both before and after the crash of the aircraft aboard which most of the cast flies. Andes and Phyllis Kirk are I suggest unforgettable lovers played off the obnoxious character impersonated capably by Gene Barry. The elder actors from Fred Clark to Beulah Bondi are all excellent and the plot lineinvolving an attempt to repair one of the downed plane's engines to escape a jungle inhabited by headhuntersis particularly exciting. Especially this is so I argue because with one engine and a short runway everyone in the downed party cannot be flown to safety. Who will decide who lives and who diesand on what basisforms a strong counterpoint to the film's basic examination of how ethical considerations affect the way people live in normal situations. This is a welldirected and very wellremembered film one that is extremely underrated and I suggest worth watching many times over. But its greatest asset is Keith Andes who made a near miracle as usual out of slim opportunities.".

On the other hand Robert Ryan and Keith Andes as copilots Beulah Bondi and Cameron Prud'Homme as an elderly couple Phyllis Kirk and Gene Barry as a mismatched young couple and Jon Provost before his Lassie fame do excellent jobs considering the fact that their roles are stereotypes. There are also less fortunate roles played by Adele Mara Jesse White and Fred Clark. Mara's sudden exit from the plane at the height of the storm at least spares her the difficulty of facing the rest of the film as a stranded stewardess.Toplined in the cast is Rod Steiger as a criminal facing execution once he is returned to authorities. In an ironic twist of fate he's the one who eventually chooses who shall leave the jungle crash scene and who shall not.Interesting but no real improvement over the original except for a few of the performances. All in all good Bpicture entertainment.The most convincing moments are the plane's anxious moments during a wild thunderstorm. This is by and far the most visually compelling part of the film in which Farrow's direction and some good special effects shows his capabilities.".

	schema:reviewBody "The long list of great movies attributed to Robert Ryan span from here to eternity and beyond. This film which is among his best is entitled  Back From Eternity.  It tells the story of a group of nine passengers traveling aboard a plane destined for remote locations. Unfortunately the plane is forced to crash in the uncivilized headhunter jungles of South America and the audience becomes more acquainted with the passenger list as they are exposed to indigenous danger. Robert Ryan is Bill Lonagan the tired world weary veteran pilot who dreams of a place in the sun. Rod Steiger plays Vasquel a condemned man facing the gallows. Keith Andes is Joe Brooks the ever stalwart CoPilot. Gene Barry Fred Clark Jesse White and Jon Provost add definite color to the cast as does Anita Ekberg Phyllis Kirk Louise Melhorn Beulah Bondi Martha Spangler as the Stewardess. Each have reasons to live and a couple the courage to die. In between we learn just how deep convictions are and what we believe is not what we expect from appearances. Rod Steiger gives a sterling performance which should have earned him an Academy Award. The film has a certain panache worthy of a Classic and we who view it should be fortunate to have seen it. Recommended to any looking for a great movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "The long list of great movies attributed to Robert Ryan span from here to eternity and beyond. This film which is among his best is entitled  Back From Eternity.  It tells the story of a group of nine passengers traveling aboard a plane destined for remote locations. Unfortunately the plane is forced to crash in the uncivilized headhunter jungles of South America and the audience becomes more acquainted with the passenger list as they are exposed to indigenous danger. Robert Ryan is Bill Lonagan the tired world weary veteran pilot who dreams of a place in the sun. Rod Steiger plays Vasquel a condemned man facing the gallows. Keith Andes is Joe Brooks the ever stalwart CoPilot. Gene Barry Fred Clark Jesse White and Jon Provost add definite color to the cast as does Anita Ekberg Phyllis Kirk Louise Melhorn Beulah Bondi Martha Spangler as the Stewardess. Each have reasons to live and a couple the courage to die. In between we learn just how deep convictions are and what we believe is not what we expect from appearances. Rod Steiger gives a sterling performance which should have earned him an Academy Award. The film has a certain panache worthy of a Classic and we who view it should be fortunate to have seen it. Recommended to any looking for a great movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Back from Eternity 1956A surprisingly well made movie. The plot is a big contrivance in a way a calculated drama of conflicting character types in a survival situation. But the acting is excellent the script tight and the direction and pacing really strong. Robert Ryan leads the group literally as the pilot of the doomed plane and he's in great restrained form. Eventually he is matched as an actor but the nuanced quirky Rod Steiger who plays a criminal of sorts. The two leading women are Anita Ekberg who is here as an ornament as usual but ends up being a decent character after all and Phyllis Kirk and dependable secondary actress.It's probably coincidence but here is a movie about an airplane by the studio RKO run by Howard Hughes and aircraft industrialist. And it was one of RKO's last films being ruined along with all the studios by the collapse of Old Hollywood. While not a big budget movie the sets are contrived to work within their limitations being stuck as it were in the jungle. The weirdest thing here might be that the director and producer John Farrow made the same movie in 1939. The first one is supposed to be better but I haven't seen it and this one holds its own. Partly it's just the searing acting of Steiger and of Ryan. If the plot were not quite so improbable and the inevitable weeding out of the survivors from the victims the movie might be considered really excellent. It never wavers except maybe the girl fight in the pool which is stupidity and it has lots of nuances and romantic touches.".

By updating the story to 1956 nothing really was improved although the film is good to watch because of the performances Mr. Farrow was able to get from this cast.The first part of the film brings together all the characters into a small airport where they are preparing to embark for another point in South America. The flight is commandeered by Bill Lonagan who is a strange man that seems to be going through a rough patch in his life. The copilot is Joe Brooks a young man who doesn't trust the older captain.The passengers are an assortment of characters that have been put together by fate or so it seems. There is the beautiful Rena who is going to work in a casino. The Spanglers a professor and his wife who are on a studying trip. Then there is Jud Ellis and Louise who are going to Brazil but have missed their flight and are forced to go on the PAL flight. We also find Pete who is taking a young boy Tommy the son of a mobster to his mother and a prisoner Vasquel being taken by his guard.When the flight develops problems the captain makes the decision to land the plane in a valley in the middle of a jungle. While on the ground they realize the plane has been greatly damaged and all try to put it back in service. Unfortunately they are surrounded by an Indian tribe that is not kind to their invasion.The film is interesting to watch because of Robert Ryan and Rod Steiger who as Lonegan and Vasquel do excellent work for Mr. Farrow. There is an ensemble kind of playing in general by the supporting players making the film better than what it could have been and it holds the viewer's attention.A film to be seen as a curiosity.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a while since I saw the 1939 original Five Came Back but in trying to make a quick mental comparison I don't find much difference between the two pictures. Most of the characters retain the same names the addition of youngster Tommy Malone Jon Provost might be one of the more significant differences. Anita Ekberg as a prostitute heading to Boca Grande comes across a bit more believable than Lucille Ball in the earlier movie. As I mentioned in my review of that one I thought she was more of a hard luck gal than a hooker but you didn't have to read between any lines regarding Ekberg's Rena character here.Funny but when I saw Jesse White's name in the cast list that became one of the draws to catching this one. I didn't think I ever actually saw the long time Maytag repair man in a movie before but there WAS that Twilight Zone episode Once Upon a Time in which he previewed that role. His character here is sort of a guardian for the kid Tommy who's father made headlines as a gangster who was shot early in the film. I don't know how that scenario had anything to do with anything other than to make Tommy an orphan and a prime candidate to make it out of the jungle when the plane got fixed.Most of the other characters play out the way they did in Five Came Back with the notable inclusion of a cat fight between Ekberg's character and Phyllis Kirk's Louise. As they tumble into a jungle pond both players emerge laughing it up when copilot Joe Brooks Keith Andes comes on the scene. Considering how the fight started over Louise's budding romance with Joe it didn't end up very realistic but they must have figured the result was so outlandish they couldn't help themselves and it was just left in the story that way.With both pictures the struggle over who makes it out of the jungle merits kudos for dramatic writing and a thoughtful exploration of character motives. The elder Spangler couple makes a brave decision as Rod Steiger's Vasquel decides to face the consequences of staying behind in hostile territory. One can conjure up an alternative fate for Vasquel if one so desires but it's almost certainly his personal sacrifice that inspires the closing moments of the picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not a bad B movie but why did they remake it? I suppose because it's cheaper to recycle stories that the studio already owns than to buy new ones. Even the title seems designed by a bricoleur. From Here to Eternity 1953 to Back From Eternity 1956.The director is the same and so is the story but alas the pace is slower and heavier. In the original no time was wasted on padding. The actors spoke their lines quickly as if rushing through them to save a few frames of expensive film stock. This one carries with it a kind of languid lack of energy as if everyone involved in the production had caught yellow fever. More time is spent on romance and less on practical matters.Further we get more emphasis on a few of the characters who must explain their current state of disillusion or develop their growing love for one another. It's less of an ensemble movie than the 1939 version. Just two examples. Robert Ryan gets far more screen time than Chester Morris did in the same role. And Gene Barry's role as the spoiled cowardly rich drunk is reduced to a few nasty lines.And the evolution of the group's self consciousness is weakened by the absence of a montage in the original in which we see everyone working happily away at their tasks laughing and getting to know each other. There is no such animation here only fatigue.Robert Ryan's part the pilot is given greater emphasis but his specialty is doing an impression of a boiler whose valves are closed and which is just about to explode at the seams. And here he more or less walks through the part unusual for him because of his inherent dynamism. Rod Steiger is more important than Joseph Callaeia in the original too. The old professor is no longer the expert on Jivaro headhunting. Steiger is now the authority. That's fine for Steiger but it leaves the elderly professor twisting in the wind. Just exactly what the hell does he TEACH anyway? Nobody seems to care.In some ways this film makes more of an impression than the earlier one. The airplane is bigger for instance as are Anita Ekberg's bosoms. And it has one or two unforgettable scenes. The beautiful wooden Phyllis Kirk helping the guys heave the airplane off the ground tottering in the middle of the Amazon jungle in her chic outfit and high heels. Kirk and Ekberg having a heck of a good time fighting in a studiobound pool of jungle water unable to stop from laughing as they wrestle and bat at each other. Come to think of it any normal man wouldn't mind joining the fight. How about some mud and bikinis in the NEXT remake?".

	onyx:emotionText "Not a bad B movie but why did they remake it? I suppose because it's cheaper to recycle stories that the studio already owns than to buy new ones. Even the title seems designed by a bricoleur. From Here to Eternity 1953 to Back From Eternity 1956.The director is the same and so is the story but alas the pace is slower and heavier. In the original no time was wasted on padding. The actors spoke their lines quickly as if rushing through them to save a few frames of expensive film stock. This one carries with it a kind of languid lack of energy as if everyone involved in the production had caught yellow fever. More time is spent on romance and less on practical matters.Further we get more emphasis on a few of the characters who must explain their current state of disillusion or develop their growing love for one another. It's less of an ensemble movie than the 1939 version. Just two examples. Robert Ryan gets far more screen time than Chester Morris did in the same role. And Gene Barry's role as the spoiled cowardly rich drunk is reduced to a few nasty lines.And the evolution of the group's self consciousness is weakened by the absence of a montage in the original in which we see everyone working happily away at their tasks laughing and getting to know each other.

	schema:headline " Director Farrow remakes his own Five Came Back 1939 to lesser success";
	schema:reviewBody "Produced and directed by John Farrow this remake of director Farrow's earlier RKO film Five Came Back 1939 features the same Richard Carroll story but this one's screenplay was written by Jonathan Latimer instead. It's a slightly above average adventure drama that doesn't quite have the impact or originality of the earlier film but does feature more richly defined characters including more about their backgrounds than the original did this one is 25 minutes longer.The story is about a South American bound airliner with passengers from differing backgrounds that is forced by a storm to land in a jungle containing headhunters. The survivors must repair the plane in time to escape a terrible fate but then learn that it will only carry five back from eternity such that a decision has to made. The cast is both recognizable and in some cases excellentRobert Ryan plays the experienced even legendary pilot Bill Lonagan who drinks a bit as he nears retirement. Anita Ekberg plays the fallen woman an unwanted foreignborn close to being deported Las Vegas casino good time girl named Rena. Rod Steiger plays Vasquel who's on his way to death row in South America for a political assassination attempt on a General. Phyllis Kirk plays Louise Melhorn who's eloping with Jud Ellis played by Gene Barry but later has eyes for the young copilot Joe Brooks played by Keith Andes.Departing from the original Barry's character is not as well defined as Patric Knowles's wealthy businessman and in fact appears only to be a playboy of sorts. In fact his subsequent downfall is barely shown making Louise's loss of interest in him appear more about her sudden attraction to Joe than her disdain for a lack of demonstrable character on Jud's part. Fred Clark plays the bounty hunter Crimp who's only strength is derived from the weapon he carries that's taking Vasquel to justice. Beulah Bondi and Cameron Prud'Homme play the older couple Martha and Professor Henry Spangler who come to know Vasquel best in the jungle the two men sharing common interests. Jesse White plays gunman Pete Boswick who's escorting his mob boss's Tol Avery uncredited six year old son Tommy Malone Jon Provost. Adele Mara plays the illfated stewardess Maria Alvarez. James Burke uncredited plays the airline manager Grimsby.Rather than beginning at the airport as the original does this one starts in Las Vegas where the background of Anita Ekberg's Rena is much better defined than Lucille Ball's fallen woman Peggy Nolan. Plus rather than being a onestop sleeper flight that includes all of the principal cast from the beginning the characters in this remake are staged to converge onto the same doomed plane from a couple of different airports within in the U.S. and then south of the border.Other minor differences besides just the character's names in this film when compared to the original include copilot Brooks the surname of the pilot in the first one doesn't show a preflight interest in Ellis's fiance Pete is a more reluctant nursemaid for Tommy almost allowing the boy to fly alone before finding out by reading the paper vs. hearing it on the radio in flight that his boss had been killed plus Pete is searched and his gun is removed from him before he boards the plane after the crash the possibility of hiking out is never discussed less screentime given to how the survivors obtained and prepared their food and living quarters therefore who does and doesn't do this work is less character revealing Steiger's anarchist is given more time on screen naturally there's a catfight between Louise and Rena over Joe in the stream and this one has a last touching moment between the Spanglers discussing their quasiparental feelings just before the end.".

It's basically impossible to tell them apart. The only difference is the latter being 25 minutes longer and it has Rod Steiger who always brings in a great performance. Even in my golden years both of these movies still stick with me after I've seen them and I've never grown weary of seeing either one.

Now towards the end of RKO's years as a movie making studio Farrow was back with basically the same story where really nothing changed but the year.That being said a 1950's sexuality with the almost spilling out of her dress presence of Anita Ekberg playing the mistress of a powerful businessman who suddenly kicks her to the curb. She is traveling to South America with an assorted group of troubled passengers which include an aging couple Cameron Prud'Homme and Beaulah Bondi a mobster's son Jon Provost with his reluctant caretaker Maytag repairman commercial vet Jesse White a longseparated couple desperate to marry Keith Andes and Phyllis Kirk and eventually the political prisoner Rod Steiger and the bounty man Fred Clark at his snarkiest on their way to Steiger's execution. Add into the fix a boozy pilot Robert Ryan and his copilot Gene Barry who has admired him from afar for years.The first half introduces the story of all these people and is simply a retread of what audiences had seen the year earlier in the much better The High and the Mighty. However once the plane crashes in the jungle with only Bondi passing out presumably out of shock the film takes off as fast as the plane crashed and the conflicts of these people stuck together in the Amazon with a headshrinking tribe rumored to be in the area explodes into tensions civilization couldn't fix. Steiger's prisoner is actually the wisest man among the planewrecked crew spouting wisdoms to try and keep them from killing each other. Once the plane is fixed only some of them can return the rest doomed to stay to take their chances with the natives who's drums are already beating.Steiger's character reminded me of Walter Slezak's Nazi villain in the 1944 Hitchcock classic Lifeboat the prisoner who is actually smarter than the people holding him hostage. Steiger however isn't using his smarts to turn everyone against each other He's actually better in many ways than the ones living inside the law and it is touching to see him bonding with the elderly couple who are at first shocked by his crime of being a political assassin.This film might have been a bit better had it been in color especially since the original was in black and white. However that doesn't keep this from being a good film giving us a good catfight between Ekberg and Kirk a seemingly hard as nails mobster with White hiding a big heart for the kid he's protecting and an amusing villain in Clark who shows that not everybody who is on the side of the law is actually on the side of justice.".

	schema:reviewBody "While Top Gun 2 never made it off the ground given the passing of Tony Scott and more importantly the lack of a credible rogue nationenemy even Top Gun had the pilots battle unidentified enemy bogeys that had generic communist markings on the MiGs the clear and present danger that South Korea faces in the threats from the North gives it the bandwidth to craft a scenario that's fully plausible with the film industry taking certain liberties with the maneuverability of the planes they feature but hey it's movie making so a little fantasy to spice up some aerial dogfights is more than expected for entertainment's sake.For fans hungry for air combat scenes this film featured plenty of stunts effects and battles that really made Top Gun look very dated especially in its adoption of more fanciful camera work that seemed to fluidly move around the aircraft when it's in rapid motion in the air. Views are offered in and around the cockpit bubble sometimes slowed down for somewhat comical staring of daggers between opponents. There's the usual dogfights between planes  having the F15 do battle against its archrival the MiG29  is pure delight for any combat aviation fan and if my eyes didn't play tricks on me look out for the MiG's fabled cobra maneuver  I'd almost jump out of my seat with disbelief and glee when that happened.Soar into the Sun has a whole host of arsenal deployed and missions to fulfill such as airto air surfacetoair airtosurface missiles antiaircraft guns and missions from routine patrols infiltration and search and rescue all making it one holistic look at the workings of an air force. And what's more not only do fighter pilots get in on the action but attention being paid to the ground technical crew who keep the planes in tip top condition in between sorties as well as ground commandos in extraction missions using their fixed wing aircraft trained to rescue pilots who are downed behind enemy lines  and yes this is yet another subplot that managed to find its way into the narrative based on the John Moore film in 2001 starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson in his rare outing as an action hero.Rain completed this film before heading toward his obligatory national service and here he plays hotshot what else? pilot Jung TaeHoon who's the youngest in the acrobatic Black Eagles team flying the FA50T50 Golden Eagle flown by Indonesia and South Korea's air force only which is a trainer and multirole fighter. But his decision to spice up a routine air show wasn't appreciated and he also becomes the fastest to get sacked from the acrobatic team being redeployed to an operationally ready squadron because its commanding officer believes that his talent with an aircraft shouldn't be gone to waste.What is probably unheard of if this is done by Hollywood is to admit that the main protagonist isn't the perfect all rounder he is. It's established early on that TaeHoon is the specialist in low flying so he isn't quite cut out as scenes would prove that he's dogfight material. so this means Rain having to step aside and share the limelight with Yu JunSang as Major Lee who is their squadron's ace. And although the F15K variant here is obviously the aircraft of choice and the superior fighter in the film it's a nod toward Korean pride to have its lead fly the FA50T50 Golden Eagle for his final all important mission that delivered the payload.The money shot is of course what you've caught a glimpse of in the trailer where two F15s are hot on the heels of a MiG29 or at times vice versa as they storm through the skyscape of Seoul. The stunt and visual effects team did a great job to create that urban battle scenario and yes I'm raving about that cobra maneuver again. Aerial combats in the film are sleekly choreographed and the brownie points come in watching this in a theatre with optimal sound because you'll be able to hear the roar of the planes' afterburners when they kick in.So I guess it's enough on the hardware and the technical aspects of Soar into the Sun so what about the storyline? It's perfunctory to say the least with balance achieved in providing the myriad of characters their particular idiosyncrasies and one note role in the narrative. There's the token love interest for TaeHoon in Sergeant SeYoung Shin SeKyung the prettiest and most competent technical ground crew around her boss and comic relief played by Oh Dal Su fellow copilot YooJin Lee HaNa and the rookie Lee JongSuk whom I do not know how he'd pass the pilot qualifying tests for his frequent fainting spells when subjected to high Gforces.Soar into the Sun also known as R2B Return to Base is pure entertainment where the story didn't really do much with odd screwball comedy thrown around it does provide one heck of an adrenaline ride. Rain fans will celebrate at an obligatory scene where their idol appears topless but the real stars of the film are the military hardware on display. And this scores from every angle you're seeing this film from. So I'd give it a biased definite recommendation!".

	schema:reviewBody "South Korea's answer to TOP GUN 1986  SOAR INTO THE SUN a.k.a. R2B RETURN TO BASE is a bigbudget blockbuster tries to replicate the Hollywoodstyle of filmmaking mostly found in any summer movie tentpole. It certainly has that showy and expensive look particularly for its many impressive aerial stunts more on that later. But writerdirector Kim DongWon botches everything up with too many cheesy melodrama and mawkish sentimentality borderlined into selfparody. No wonder the movie ends up underperformed at the domestic boxoffice.In this embarrassingly lackluster movie the story centers on Jang TaeHun Rain a cocky young pilot of the South Korean Air Force's elite Black Eagles squad who gets expelled of the team following from his dangerous daredevil stunt at an air show. As a punishment he is immediately transferred to the 21 Combat Unit which is led by Park DaeSeo Kim SungSu. Meanwhile it doesn't take long before he makes enemy with an ace pilot Lee CheolHee Yu JunSang who particularly hate each other. Naturally they prepare to engage in a flight contest to see which among of them emerge as the best pilot in the 21 Combat Unit. Of course such genre movie like that wouldn't be complete without an obligatory love interest. Enter Sgt. Yoo SeYoung Shin SeKyung a failed pilotturnedhead of maintenance who loves to act cool and doesn't particularly talks much even though TaeHun likes her very much.Clocking at 113 minutes I must admit that watching SOAR INTO THE SUN is seriously a test of patience. The first half is especially a huge letdown in which the story drags too much that goes into nowhere. Most of the time we are forced to sit through a longwinded stretch of some lame romantic comedy particularly the one involving TaeHun and SeYoung found in Korean TV drama and not to mention many other annoying subplots. If Kim DongWon is trying hard to be funny then he fails miserably. Even by the time the movie reaches the second half with a sudden change of dramatic tone it's already too late and too little to redeem everything.Still those are looking forward for some sensory thrills will be excited by the aforementioned aerial stunts. The two climactic highlights  the aerial battle within the city of Seoul and the explosive finale  are undeniably breathtaking with swooping cameraworks and magnificent sound effects that they are best seen in a big screen theaters.Too bad that's the only good thing about this movie. The rest is simply a monumental waste of time. If that's not insulting enough the cast is a total disappointment who are all nothing more than onenote stereotypical characters. Rain who completed this movie before heading off for his obligatory national service gives an unremarkable performance who spends most of the time looking too cheesy or ahem cutesy. Sure he does show some seriousness towards the second half but by then it's really hard to take him seriously. As for the rest of the supporting actors the less said the better.So much for a socalled movie specially released in remembrance of the 60th anniversary of the Korean War.".

There was too many silly lines that I wonder if this was suppose to be a manga filled humour or a live action film. The thing I found interesting though is the tensed relationship with the Americans and Koreans when dealing with missile crisis couldn't the writers explore on that more than silly aspect of the film. Poor CGI while it is understandable that there are parts of the film where real fighter jets cannot be used i.e. city dog fight scenes I believe that they could have done a better job. The characters I really don't think the Korean Air force would have allowed impulsive childish and hot headed pilots into their ranks. And what is with them abusing the engineers. Come on its the military discipline team work and proper conduct is a big thing there. Verdict Disappointing this film could have done better.".

The CG dogfighting in Seoul and the strike at Wonsan base is really amazing and look realistic. However it is lack of realistic detail and can be really annoying.Military expert can get really annoyed by the action scene filled with unrealistic event. The dogfight scene break several laws of aerodynamic and thermodynamic. The missile locking system are strange too. In several events you can see the pilot shoot a ground target with airtoair missile. Also The director forgot that MiG29A carry only 100 round of ammunition for the cannon. But the excitement of the battle mean that we can ignore that. The movie end with another fcking romantic scene. Annoying already in the first half you really can fall asleep at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie presents us with another fighter pilot themed story a theme that hasn't seen any good work on its regard since Top Gun. The plot served here is quite the average of competition among ace pilots mixed with their onground relationships. One thing that makes it's more interesting than others with the fact that this movie uses the inherent war potential between the two Koreas as its finale. But the execution can be deemed too pretentious in my opinion. It's because despite the age and technology is supportive the plot doesn't seem to be real when it comes to all the technical things about the air combat. For instance when Taehun's jet plunged into the sea after he put off the engine to evade the missile the plane didn't pierce the water like it should. Rather it looked like it dropped from some five meters or so bouncing it's way on the water surface. These 'uniqueness' supports the story's continuation about the characters surviving the crashes and so on. But it surely looked stupid for those for understand physics even at the least bit. The acting is a typical Korean work just enough to have the story to roll on.".

Under those circumstances the seasoned mercenary Lone Starr and his trusty halfhuman half canine sidekick Barf will attempt to save the princess in distress while at the same time the ruthless loan shark Pizza the Hut is after them.

	schema:reviewBody "Spaceballs is one of my favorite comedies of all time it's actually one of those few movies that I know every single line too. I know that seems a bit sad but this film has so many memorable lines that it came so natural. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and the strange thing is that every time I watch it it just seems to get funnier and funnier. I don't understand how a person could not laugh with this film it just has perfect humor that I'm sure could make the emotionally stunted person laugh. How could you not laugh at Rick Morannis as Lord Helmet? He was beyond a perfect choice for Helmet he was the complete opposite of what Darth Vadar was and he didn't have a problem making fun of himself. In fact the whole cast looked like they had the ultimate blast making this film everyone clicked so well. The story is one of Mel's finest parades of course this one is of Star Wars or pretty much any space film.Lord Helmet and President Skroob wish to steal all of Planet Druidia's fresh air and transfer it onto their own but they must get the combination to the air shield that is protecting it. King Roland's daughter Princess Vespa runs away from her wedding since King Roland is the king of Druidia Lord Helmet kidnaps her to get the combination. King Roland asks space rebel Lone Starr and his faithful side kick Moghalfman halfdog Barf to save the princess. But things quickly turn bad when Helmet does get the combination and now Lone Starr must use the schwartz and defeat Lord Helmet and Skroob before they suck all the air from Druidia.Spaceballs is seriously just a great comedy I guarantee you that you will have a good laugh by watching this film. Every scene is just so funny my favorite is always the one with Lord Helmet playing with his dolls and Corinel Sanders walks in on him you'll just have to see what I mean but it's the funniest scene in my opinion. But there isn't one scene that isn't funny. If you are a fan of Mel Brooks I don't see any reason why you shouldn't love this film it's my second favorite just behind Young Frankenstein but that was a tough choice. I highly recommend Spaceballs for anyone please see this film you won't regret it.1010".

Lots of space sagas get equal ribbing the Star Wars trilogy Alien Planet of the Apes and there isn't a cliche that Mel fails to notice. You can't blame Mel Brooks for thinking this genre needed a good skewering. He started it in History of the World with his Jews in Space coming attraction and continues it here.  My only complaint Mel why did you have to wait so long??Eight stars plus a half star more for Pizza the Hutt I loved it especially when the pepperoni started running.  Also for President Skroob's Brooks' comment after being mistransported Why didn't somebody tell me my a was so big??.  Okay nine stars.  Mel Brooks strikes back!".

It may not be as smart as The Producers or as complete as Blazing Saddles but it's every bit as funny as anything he's ever made and that's saying something. Its lighthanded approach to storytelling where the jokes come first and the plot developments are a distant second is actually very similar to 1981's History of the World Part I  which should be no surprise as they're backtoback in his sequential catalog. Rick Moranis Bill Pullman and John Candy really come to life in their roles as notsosubtle parodies of Darth Vader Han Solo and Chewbacca respectively with Moranis in particular somehow getting deep laughs out of lines so cheesy a Taco Bell nacho would flinch. As dumb comedies go it's a heavyweight champion so infinitely quotable that my buddies and I had to enforce a strict one Spaceballs reference per day policy back in school to keep things from getting out of hand.

Spaceballs starts off by showing us a spaceship...for a very long time. Then we learn that the planet Spaceballs has used up all its air. So Pres. Skroob Mel Brooks has sent the ultraevil ultradork Dark Helmet Rick Moranis to kidnap Princess Vespa Daphne Zuniga from the planet Druidia to extort their air.Fear not! There are two people who can save her spacetraveling everyman Lone Starr Bill Pullman and his halfdog halfhuman friend Barf John Candy and the character is his own best friend!. And they do it by jamming Dark Helmet's radar...with real jam.From there the whole thing is typical Mel Brooks stuff with a gag every minute and parts where they admit that they're in a movie. I think that my favorite part is when they watch Spaceballs The Movie But we're barely halfway through making it!. But the scene where John Hurt spoofs one of his most famous scenes is also something. A laugh riot from beginning to end. Also starring Dom DeLuise Dick Van Patten George Wyner and the voice of Joan Rivers.May the Schwartz be with us all!".

I really remember how funny i thought it was especially considering that many of the other things i watched were crappy sciencefiction films that were also on cable then. Many people seem to think that this is a spoof of Star Wars but really it's more a spoof of the whole sciencefiction genre. Not least that lowbudget crap i used to watch on TV on Sunday's movies that i can't remember the title of and that you're not likely to see on collector's DVD any time soon.So how does this hold up now that i've watched it again after all this time? Well better than i thought that's for sure. I was afraid that this movie would be one of those i loved before but couldn't understand at all any more. But while i didn't exactly love it this time around i still understand why i loved it back then. And there are still a few really good laughs here. Not least when it comes to Rick Moranis Darth Vaderspoof Dark Helmet. A few of the scenes with him and his whole appearance still make me laugh.Aside from the sciencefiction theme this is mostly regular Mel Brooksfare. I've always had two major problems with him. First of all the fact that he always mixes really funny stuff with horribly dated and boring scenes. Second of all i'm no fan of Brooks acting. Many times his characters are among the least funny in the movie and sometimes when he gives himself a lot of room that can be a problem.In general though this movie is generally quite funny. It's far from one of Brooks greatest Blazing Saddles is my favorite and it's light years better if you'll excuse the pun but it still holds it's own and is superior to many of his later movies. It feels a bit dated and the pace is far from today's quickpaced comedies. But in general i still like it. 610.".

When I was at school a group of us produced a short radio programme spoofing Star Wars.  It was about as funny as being stabbed repeatedly through the heart yet for its 15 minute duration managed to be more amusing than the material the entire length of Spaceballs showcased.Mel Brooks' films are notorious for being either hits or misses.

The problem with Spaceballs however is immediately apparent  only a 10 yearold could find this garbage even slightly amusing but the movie is so full of profane and vulgar humor that a 10 yearold has no business watching it.What is absolutely remarkable however are these IMDb user reviews lauding the movie.

Nearly every joke and gag is funny and at its best which is at least a third of this it is impossibly hilarious. There is silliness slapstick wordplay and breaking the fourth wall materialin fact this has the best of such that I've seen committed to film. As the Darth Vader we have Rick Moranis as the tiny orderbarking insecure dictator who overcompensates by having a huge helmet. The characters aren't bad and there are sort of arcs to a couple of them. This having a proper if simple and clichd plot helps its rewatchability. Even if you stripped all the humor stuff would be going on. The story is actually basically a fairie tale that is set in the SW universe. There is a bit of disturbing content and sexually suggestive stuff as well as a moderate amount of strong language in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to every fan of parody. 710".

Spaceballs is the funniest parody movie I have ever seen and blows the hell out of Scary Movie. Spaceballs has good acting story characters and special FX. Not one flaw can be found about this movie. The movie parodies mainly Star Wars but also throws in some Star Trek Alien Planet of the Apes and stuff like that. Bill Pullman and John Candy make a hilarious and memorable duo. Pullman gives the highlight of his career as Lone Starr. Candy gives an award winning performance as the Mog Barf. Mel Brooks plays a hilarious President Skroob. Rick Moranis was extra funny as the nerdy short version of Darth Vader Dark Helmet. Daphne Zuniga was well cast as the bratty annoying selfabsorbed Princess Vespa. Even Joan Rivers does a good voiceover of the sidekick C3PO knock off Dot Matrix. Everything about this movie was great. Me and my friends always quote this movie and everything. Every school has a band of Star Wars Nerds but in our case its Spaceballs Nerds. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone with a sense of humor. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having grown up with Star Wars as a child  being introduced to Mel Brooks films as a young teen this movie seemed like a dream match when it was announced in my late teens. I mean Mel Brooks was going to make a spoof of Star Wars !It had been a while since the last Mel Brooks movie and even though History of the world Part I was not even close to what I had come to regard as up to par for a Mel Brooks film I was excited over all of the possibilities that Star Wars would provide for Mel Brooks' parody. But I soon realized in the theater that this is simply not a funny movie. The humor in this is so shallow  unimaginative that I still have trouble believing that this came from the same person who brought us Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. Those films featured witty and clever type of slapstick comedy. It was the type of comedy that knows no time period. At times those films would incorporate risque humor that actually worked. Here Mel Brooks' comedy seems so umimaginative. It's grammer school kid humor. He actually spoofed the Jabba the Hut character with a character named Pizza the Hut...and for as stupid as that sounds it's even more idiotic  unfunny on the screen. It's just not funny. What was once Brooks' risque mind is now prepuberty humor  My schwartz is bigger than yours. I remember sitting in the theater just waiting  HOPING  for a scene that would even hint at the genius of Blazing Saddles  Young Frankenstein. There isn't one in this film.Even the cast is hopelessly unhappy. Jim Candy Rick Moranis and Bill Pullman seem poised for humor  but everything that comes out of their mouths is just predictable  childish. Every character in this film seems like it was conceived within a 5 minute idea session where all the writers and Brooks got together  said things like What's a good spoof for Darth Vader ? How about um....Lord Dark Helmet ! HAHAHA ! Yha we'll use that ! So what's a good idea for Chewbacca ? How about a half doghalf man character ? YHA ! Let's use that ! What should we name him ? How about something stupid like Barf ? Yha ! Let's do that !There is such a wealth of material to spoof in Star wars that I still can't believe someone especially Mel Brooks could make such a shallow spoof such as this. What I had hoped would be a return to form for Brooks turned out to be confirmation that his comedic ability had indeed seen its best days. AFter this Brooks only made more and more hopelessly tired spoofs such as Robin Hood  Men In Tights and Dracula  Dead and Loving It. Mel Brooks' humor is indeed gone. Nowadays when I see him make guest appearances on Curb Your Enthusiasm he seems like that old uncle who tries to make all the kids laugh at family get togethers. The uncle was probably a funny kid back in high school  but now the years have caught up with him  his humor is just tired dated and boring.".

That SPACEBALLS also tells its own entertaining story that holds up as a standalone adventure is testament to its effectiveness. Strong production values and fun effects only add to the experience.The cast is a superior one with the highlights including Joan Rivers as 'Dot Matrix' and the lovably goofy John Candy playing a halfman halfdog. Rick Moranis really shines though in his best role as 'Dark Helmet' and many of his scenes are the funniest the film has to offer also watch out for Mel Brooks's scenestealing 'Yogurt'. The laughs come thick and fast and not all of them are funny but when the film hits it really hits the scenes involving instant video cassettes and breaking the fourth wall are the funniest. My overall highlight though has to be John Hurt's cameo which is the icing on an already splendid cake.".

	schema:reviewBody "A parody of Star Wars and Aliens and some other films of the type space science fiction is of course welcome because we like taking things unseriously nonseriously seriousnesslessly. So it is funny and that is not a surprise. Mel Brooks knows how to make things both funny and silly so that we can gargle with giggles and barf with laughter. But the film has the main defect all Mel Brooks's films have. The humor is essentially punctual so we have one joke after another one smile after another one pleasant moment after another but there is no structural derision of the models. The final birth of an alien is funny both because of the situation in which it happens and it surprises us then and because the alien is turned into some kind of longtailed Fred Astaire or Zizi Jeanmaire. With a few bananas it could have impersonated Josephine Baker. The River Kwai song is funny because it surprises us too especially since we were expecting seven dwarfs and their song when going down to the mine. But that is all. Beyond this fun nothing zilch. And that's a shame because the subject could have been a real mine of structural humor against these big space sagas that process the audience into some kind of slightly and even at times a lot intellectually and culturally retarded people. The only attempt at this structural humor is to make the king of the good ones regress beyond some kind of constitutional monarchy to look like an old feudal monarchy in the absurd way they dress a King Lear comic clown. But that does not shoot the moon down from the sky. In the same way the transformation of the bad spaceship into the statue of Liberty is pure derision but the transformation of her beams of light around her head into escape routes that defecate the wrecked soldiers does not really provides the film with some structural meaning like the satire of American democracy and liberty that are at times quite dark in their general functioning. Funny for sure in the absurd line of definition of this term funny too when you can read most of the allusions but the fun is scattered and sprinkled all over as if the millions of stars could be compared to the unique and sole sun.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

The engagement is celebrated with an extravagant party at his estate which is a gigantic palace and park in oriental style. His son Eduard arrives from Cambridge accompanied by a priest who is his tutor. The priest is disgusted by the bacchanalian reveling and womanizing going on everywhere. Mary's adorer the sculptor Harry Lighton tries to convince her to break the engagement. When she refuses he shoots himself and is seriously injured.

	schema:reviewBody "In the late 1910s and early 1920s the Hollywood biblical epic was going through a genrenongratis phase and would not really make a comeback until Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments in 1923. However over in Europe they were still reeling from the mighty splendour of Intolerance 1916 and a small yet prestigious Austrian company called SaschaFilm was planning a big moral picture of its own.Like Intolerance Sodom and Gomorrah has a modernday framing story which may seem quite improbable for such a resolutely Old Testamentstyle fable. And yet in a selfconfident bid to give it relevance a line has been drawn between jazz age excess and the unmentionable sins of the Sodomites. Of course a little pragmatism may have been at work here too  after all it's not easy to translate about half a page of bible text into several hours of screen time especially when the sensitivities of the day mean you can't paint too vivid a picture of those aforementioned sins. Still the writers appear to have taken a few liberties with scripture too with Lot's wife cast as some kind of Bronze Age vamp in what is an incredibly misogynistic take on the tale.The look of this picture owes more to the Expressionist movement of neighbouring Germany than it does to the epics of Hollywood. Designers Julius von Borsody and Emil Stepanek have created a world of bizarre angular architecture with mazes of furniture and other props. Cinematographer Franz Planer later of some standing in the US does sterling work with contrast framing closeups Rembrandt style bright faces dark backgrounds while shooting midshots so that as actors approach the foreground they become silhouettes. The director here is a young Hungarian named Mihly Kertsz. Kertsz endeavours to create a look of confinement with the numerous props hemming the characters in at every angle making them to paraphrase Henry Higgins prisoners of the clutter. This creates a palpable feeling of fatefulness but Kertsz goes all out to cover ever base shooting many scenes through peephole lenses or from a stark objective distance. Kertsz's use of depth is rather neat however enclosing the frame at the sides but often having a doorway open at the back of the set to give an eerie tunnel effect. Generally however the tone is one of Expressionist overkill.Amidst all the business of the set the actors themselves become little more than mobile props. The acting is not that good anyway with most of the cast limiting themselves to one facial expression only even a young Walter Slezak who is incredibly bland here compared to his masterful turns in his portly Hollywood heyday. An alsoyouthful Victor Varconi isn't much better but with his devilish good looks he doesn't really need to act here and with his commanding presence he makes a great angel of the Lord. Slezak and Varconi would both go on to become strong supporting players in Hollywood. Kertsz too would find work in the states under the name of Michael Curtiz.This distinctly European take on the moral epic is an odd thing for the SaschaFilm to have spent such a fortune upon. Compared to its nearest stylistic relatives the work of epics and horrors of Ufa studios in Weimar Republic it lacks the austere Germanic mythical quality of such highlights Caligari or Nibelungen. Compared to its nearest thematic relatives the films of Cecil B. DeMille well The paradox of DeMille's pictures is he always made sin look like good fun even as he condemned it. He always revelled in the grandeur of ancient monuments whilst railing against idolatry and materialism. For the Austrians to portray the world of sinners as dark and grim and view those magnificent Sodom sets as if through keyholes is in fact perhaps the more logical interpretation from a strictly moralist perspective. However as anyone who has enjoyed the debauched delights of DeMille at his most hypocritical will know that would be missing the point.".

These Syrian scenes are important because they most closely reflect the 1919 experience in Kertsz' native Hungary where a Romanian army backed by the West had invaded to suppress the revolution.He then combines this with the alluring idea of a fantasy dreamscenario featuring the same actors as in the reallife framestory a gimmick that DeMille did not originate but which he used particularly effectively in Male and Female in 1918. Interestingly the idea as adapted by Kertsz parallel stories was then itself borrowed back by DeMille and Jeannie MacPherson for The Ten Commandments 1923  originally intended as a kind of sketch film with each episode devoted to a commandment  but without the doubling that Kertsz had borrowed from them and it was then reused parallel stories and doubling by Kertsz himself now Curtiz shortly after his arrival in the US for Noah's Ark 1928.In fairness Thanhouser had done something rather similar in their interesting and much underrated version of A Man Without a Country in 1917 where a modern story is parallelled with the original Edward Everett Hale story.Stylistically on the other hand as other reviewers have rightly pointed out with its symbolism its chiaroscuro and magnificent art nouveau dcors it is much closer to the stylised expressionistic vision to be found in other contemporary German films. This makes it a great deal more powerful as a film if less grandiose than either DeMille's The Ten Commandments or Curtiz' own later Noah's Ark.As satire both social and political it is again closer to German models and has far more bite than the later films. Kertsz had himself only recently arrived in Austria as a refugee from 'the White Terror that had followed the defeat of the Communist Revolution there in 1919. Although it is not a certain indication of his own political views he was more than a shade opportunistic by nature he had made one short film before leaving Hungary Jn az csm which was quite explicit propaganda on behalf of the Communist regime. Here the association of the cities of the plain with the excesses of capitalism as they appeared to many in the twenties has the air of being genuinely felt.The sense of a crisis of capitalism was at the heart of both Communist and Fascist movements in Europe. It is a mistake to judge this film entirely by the standards of DeMille and assume that the effect intended is purely one of titillation. The existential hell noted by another reviewer is no mistake.

	schema:reviewBody "Sodom und Gomorrha or Legende von Snde und Strafe or Queen of Sin and the Spectacle of Sodom and Gomorrah is a GermanAustrian silent film from 1922 so only five more years until this has its 100th anniversary. The director and writer here is Michael Curtiz and you may have heard of the name before. He was in his 30s when he made this film here. Really early in his career he made many many Hungarian films and this blackandwhite silent film here is from the years after when he made many German films before he finally went on to Hollywood where he received several Oscar nominations before winning Best Director for Casablanca. Now about this movie here. It says on IMDb that the original is 2.5 hours long and the most recent version is 1.5 but the one I saw went for 2 hours slightly over. The film starts really natural but you already hear from the title that there are biblical references in here so it did not stay that way. This film is also a pretty good example of how actors back in the day played several characters in the same film the way you may have seen it it in Cloud Atlas for example recently with these characters mostly playing at very different times so that there is no conflict really between characters by the same actor running into each other.As for the story here it was okay at best but I personally was bored quite a bit too on some occasions. It's pretty tough to appreciate a film like this if it is not on a level like Metropolis or M. The good thing here however is that this is finally a silent film where they used a sufficient quantity of intertitles as the lack of intertitles destroys many many old silent films because you see characters talk but you have no clue what they are saying and consequently what is going on because there are no words seen on the screen. Finally like I already said the biblical references here make this an okay watch perhaps for people with a great interest in religion. Apart from that I would only recommend this movie to those who really love old blackandwhite silent films. Germany was a great nation when it came to movies back then as the aforementioned Metropolis already tells you too. SG is not one of the most or least known I guess even if it is somewhat difficult to find it these days especially with German title on the screen. But it's okay. You don't have to see it. You really aren't missing too much.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sodom und Gomorrha or Legende von Snde und Strafe or Queen of Sin and the Spectacle of Sodom and Gomorrah is a GermanAustrian silent film from 1922 so only five more years until this has its 100th anniversary. The director and writer here is Michael Curtiz and you may have heard of the name before. He was in his 30s when he made this film here. Really early in his career he made many many Hungarian films and this blackandwhite silent film here is from the years after when he made many German films before he finally went on to Hollywood where he received several Oscar nominations before winning Best Director for Casablanca. Now about this movie here. It says on IMDb that the original is 2.5 hours long and the most recent version is 1.5 but the one I saw went for 2 hours slightly over. The film starts really natural but you already hear from the title that there are biblical references in here so it did not stay that way. This film is also a pretty good example of how actors back in the day played several characters in the same film the way you may have seen it it in Cloud Atlas for example recently with these characters mostly playing at very different times so that there is no conflict really between characters by the same actor running into each other.As for the story here it was okay at best but I personally was bored quite a bit too on some occasions. It's pretty tough to appreciate a film like this if it is not on a level like Metropolis or M. The good thing here however is that this is finally a silent film where they used a sufficient quantity of intertitles as the lack of intertitles destroys many many old silent films because you see characters talk but you have no clue what they are saying and consequently what is going on because there are no words seen on the screen. Finally like I already said the biblical references here make this an okay watch perhaps for people with a great interest in religion. Apart from that I would only recommend this movie to those who really love old blackandwhite silent films. Germany was a great nation when it came to movies back then as the aforementioned Metropolis already tells you too. SG is not one of the most or least known I guess even if it is somewhat difficult to find it these days especially with German title on the screen. But it's okay. You don't have to see it.

Basic storyline involves two brothers and their highly contrasting lives though they share the same house. 'Chulho Song' the older brother has a deadend job as a clerk a sick mother his sister wife and two kids. But at least he's working since 'Yongho Song' the younger brother is unemployed but still manages to spend his evenings drinking with his war buddies exhibiting an interesting assortment of war wounds. Since this film was shot in Seoul shortly after the war there are occasional shots of walls with bullet holes barbed wire and bombed out areas of the city. Wellmade drama with quite a few melodramatic flourishes but the divergent plot line keeps you guessing how the brothers will resolve their difficulties. Most ominous of all is sick mother waking up repeatedly and gasping let's get out of here. With one brother trapped in the cage of conscience and the other willing to go to extremes to get money the only real escape is death and the eventual tragic ending exemplifies that attitude. Check this one out you won't regret it. Film will be screening in NYC at the Walter Reade theater in November 2004 as part of a Korean retrospective then hopefully head elsewhere for more USA exposure to the rising Korean film industry.".

This movie is one of my favorite batman movies both animated and live action. It's in the top 10. Compare to Mask of the Phantasm this film is kind of underwhelming but a good film nevertheless.Subzero is based on an episode of the animated series called Hearts in Ice which centers around the villain Mr. Freeze. Like many incarnations in this universe this Mr. Freeze is my favorite incarnation of the character. In the old comics and in Batman and Robin he was a generic bad bad bent on world domination. In this movie he is more of a tragic character. Freeze's wife has an incurable disease and he is trying to comeup with a cure. This plot element is the driving factor for the film.The other main characters were good as well. Kevin Conroy as Batman is always great. He is my favorite Batman. Robin was okay. Barbara GordonBatgirl is okay as well though she is mostly the damsel in distress in this film. Her relationship with Robin was pretty nice.The art and animation is great as usual. The score is good as well. Most of the music is from the animated series.The problem that I have with this film and that others might have as well is that it is basically a rehash of Hearts in Ice. If you have watched the series and seen that episode you might be a bit disappointed. It basically has the same plot as the episode except extended. This movie is not in the same league as Mask of the Phantasm. However it is still a fun and entertaining movie. This movie did take itself seriously and treated the viewers like adults unlike Batman and Robin.Overall this film is an example of what Batman and Robin should have been. I think it is criminal that this went straight to video and Batman and Robin got into theaters.".

The score is good as well. Most of the music is from the animated series.The problem that I have with this film and that others might have as well is that it is basically a rehash of Hearts in Ice. If you have watched the series and seen that episode you might be a bit disappointed. It basically has the same plot as the episode except extended. This movie is not in the same league as Mask of the Phantasm. However it is still a fun and entertaining movie. This movie did take itself seriously and treated the viewers like adults unlike Batman and Robin.Overall this film is an example of what Batman and Robin should have been. I think it is criminal that this went straight to video and Batman and Robin got into theaters.";

Mr Freeze did make appearances in both series but he was portrayed as an evil villain. In actual fact Mr Freeze is not an evil villain. He has a good heart deep down and this movie portrays that wonderfully. Rather than making him into some sinister villain who wishes to freeze everything in sight the producers portrayed him as a tragic man who became a villain through little fault of his own. This is what makes this a good cartoonit's very thought provoking.Besides all that it's an action packed movie with great action scenes in it. Check it out.".

	schema:headline " Top Quality Batman Movie That Should Have Wo Some Awards";
	schema:reviewBody "If Mask of the Phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of Batman The Animated Series Subzero compliments the 15 episodes that comprise the Adventures of Batman and Robin. Mr. Freeze is one of my top favorite villains in this show thanks to Michael Ansara's magnificent portrayal of a tortured man who although dead to emotions is more determined than ever to save the life of his dying wife Nora. I love this movie better than Mask of the Phantasm because being a Batman and Robin fan I was thrilled that Robin was included in this Direct to Video Release. Kevin Conroy and Loren Lester are once again superb in their roles as Batman and Robin. Regarding Batgirl I was not exactly happy that she was in costume only briefly but as Barbara Gordon she was great as a damsel in distress but still able to take care of herself just like in the Heart of Steel 2 part episode. We even see a potential romance develop between Dick Grayson and Barbara Gordon. Dick's wild motorcycle ride after Freeze's van is definitely worth seeing. The animation quality is even better than ever partially due to CGI but hey! I'm not complaining. It's interesting to note two voice overs in this movie George Dzunda Scarface and the Ventriloquist and Perry White on Superman is the voice of Dr. Gregory Belson and Dean Jones Disney's Herbie the Love Bug movies is the voice of Belson's Stockbroker. My biggest gripe about this movie was the fact that WB decided to wait an entire year before releasing it. I felt they should have gone ahead and released it in the summer of 1997 so people could have enjoyed a better Batman and Robin movie than the abomination that Schumacher made. By airing the WB episodes first and then releasing this movie in 1998 was a mistake I felt. Why? Because if you saw the WB episode Cold Comfort you would already know the upcoming fate of Nora Fries so WB's decision to bump the release spoiled the surprise of this delightful movie for everyone. Of all the three animated Batman movies I felt that Subzero is by far the best of the three. It's also the last time we see the Batman characters in the Fox style before their revamps on the WB network plus with the exception of the Old Wounds episode it's Dick Grayson's last adventure as Robin. And my hats off to the late Mary Kay Bergman who voiced over Barbara GordonBatgirl in this movie. Like Mask of the Phantasm I highly recommend Subzero for purchase or rental.".

	schema:headline " Allow me to break the ice...";
	schema:reviewBody "I remembered finding this animated movie really great as a kid but the last time I watched it I did find it enjoyable but it ultimately left me wanting and a little annoyed as the credits rolled.. Maybe it was the fairly predictable and weak plot that never went anywhere except exactly where I was expecting it to or some of the visually impressive but not very exciting action sequences but whatever the case to me it just falls noticeably flat somewhere lacking any real depth or intrigue. It's not even that long of a movie but the pacing of it is horrible it's so damn slow! The focus is all over the place and it just feels sort of dull and listless continuously going back and forth between scenes of Batman investigating and Barbara Gordon attempting to escape her captors. There's too much action and not enough meaningful exchanges between characters. And some of the animation techniques that were new at the time didn't work at all in my opinion. 'We have the CGI environment rendered and darn it we're going to use it!' I hated it I thought it was ugly it completely stood out from the real animation and it would just take me straight out of the story whenever I would see that. However there are one or two things I do like about it it has its redeeming qualities and doesn't miss the mark completely. I like how Barbara Gordon gains a little sympathy for Freeze's plight once she learns why she's been abducted and how Batman still feels compassion for the character even after all that he's done and then deep regret that he couldn't save him from his assumed demise. And what I most appreciate about this picture is the way that it so perfectly wraps up Mr.Freeze's story arc in the bittersweet and memorable final scene. It's very moving to see Victor shed tears of happiness and that in itself is a very beautiful and poignant moment but to me it alone isn't enough to make this a very good movie.  It always seemed to me that whenever they would use Freeze in the animated series they would always try and fail to duplicate the magnificent lightning in a bottle that was Heart of Ice and sadly this too botches the recipe. Mr.Freeze is distinctly a little 'off' somewhere in this. He seems to seriously lack the deep pathos to his personally and bearing that he so effortlessly had before and he was a lot more angrier this time around. And I know that's easily explained by the way that the situation is more urgent there's no time his wife is at death's door but I found it a little hard to sympathise with a Mr.Freeze who's perfectly fine with killing a young girl even if it is to save his beloved. I mean jeez they couldn't even manage to give the guy one great line!? I mean he says one decent sentence right at the beginning when he compares his wife's frozen beauty to a flower he has found on the tundra but that's it! It's the tragic and Shakespearean dialogue that made the character what he was and elevated him so beautifully in the series in the first place! I think the character would have greatly benefited if the movie had took the time to show a couple of flashbacks of he and his wife in happier times as well as a moment where he has some kind of realisation that all he had to do all along was to just ask Batman for help and therefore learn that the world just possibly isn't the cold heartless place that he's come to believe it is. But that never happens and so he just feels underdeveloped and stretchedthin in his appearance here. Something was lost in translation... This animated feature almost succeeds but it just about falls short. Anyway as always watch it and judge for yourself and please stay chilly!".

	onyx:emotionText "I remembered finding this animated movie really great as a kid but the last time I watched it I did find it enjoyable but it ultimately left me wanting and a little annoyed as the credits rolled.. Maybe it was the fairly predictable and weak plot that never went anywhere except exactly where I was expecting it to or some of the visually impressive but not very exciting action sequences but whatever the case to me it just falls noticeably flat somewhere lacking any real depth or intrigue. It's not even that long of a movie but the pacing of it is horrible it's so damn slow! The focus is all over the place and it just feels sort of dull and listless continuously going back and forth between scenes of Batman investigating and Barbara Gordon attempting to escape her captors. There's too much action and not enough meaningful exchanges between characters. And some of the animation techniques that were new at the time didn't work at all in my opinion. 'We have the CGI environment rendered and darn it we're going to use it!' I hated it I thought it was ugly it completely stood out from the real animation and it would just take me straight out of the story whenever I would see that. However there are one or two things I do like about it it has its redeeming qualities and doesn't miss the mark completely. I like how Barbara Gordon gains a little sympathy for Freeze's plight once she learns why she's been abducted and how Batman still feels compassion for the character even after all that he's done and then deep regret that he couldn't save him from his assumed demise.

The problem is really that it was released so close to Batman and Robin but as far as I am concerned SubZero completely blows Batman and Robin out of the water. Apart from the colourful costumes and sets Batman and Robin for me failed on characterisation scripting and actingGeorge Clooney was completely wrong for Batman and Arnold Schwarznegger's Freeze didn't come close to the complex character he is in the comic books. SubZero while not as ambitious as Mask of the Phantasm is a very good film. True the secondary characters could've done with more development but it is compensated by top notch animation a good music score surprisingly mature scripting and a compelling enough story that is quite action packed and the ending was very poignant to say the least. The voice acting and characterisations were exemplary. Batman is more a side character to Robin but Kevin Conroy ensures he is his dark and brooding self like Batman should be. Robin here is quite heroic here and Barbara aka Batgirl is really beautiful. What made the film though was Freeze himself. While still chilling and ambitious he is also sympathetic and loves his wife to death. Michael Ansara conveyed that perfectly. In conclusion pretty darn good for a Batman film. 910 Bethany Cox".

And the movie's title Batman  Mr. Freeze Subzero. I was expecting Batman or bruce to have LOTS of screentime. Sadly Robin and Batgirl are the leads of this movie. Victor Fries has a major part which is great. One of the most powerful villains. He's still got a GREAT presence...and was a joy to see after Arnie's horrible appearance as the fishbowl man. Only Gripe with Fries's character... i thought got stripped of his emotions after his accident. But cracked a smile in one scene and even cried in another!The animation was okay used a lot of the 3d stuff which i don't like too much. Any episode of the series seemed to have better animation actually.The story was slow. It had a REALLY long character introduction scene. Not a single Batterang was thrown either! And batmanbruce was only in it for like 15 mins total i'd bet.Again i have never liked robin or batgirl. These are Batman's weakest points to me he has to help them or they write ways for them to help batman. Plus they supply an easy way to have batman explain to the audience what he's thinking.It's worth seeing once if you're a fan...or even a casual fan of the series. But i'd still try to find an regular episode of batman vs. freeze. even at 22 mins and episode it seems to have more impact. I don't think i need to see it again. Now i'll go watch phantasm again  Toom".

Despite its aging it was good for the time.The only real complaint I have is the the abbreviated running time. Shorter even than Mask of the Phantasm the clipped pacing doesn't allow for much in the way of character development. But the animation is strong and so is the action particularly the submarine opening and Dick's chase with Freeze. There's great imagery in this movie and I love that Freeze has polar bear henchmen.

This flick was at first planned to be released in 1997 but due to the massive back lash which the abomination Batman and Robin received the date went back a whole year! Now Let's dive in to the main components that make it so good. Starting with a the story. We follow Doctor Victor Freeze  who is desperate to find a donor of his wife in order to save her and for that he devise a plan in order to find a suitable donor and fast.So he abducts Barbara Gordon AKA Batgirl and it is up to the Boy Wander and the Knight of Gotham City to find her. OK the story may lacks some originalitybut its job of make you understand why everyone do what his or her is doing so we are fine hereTo the b realism of the Characters I want to emphasize here for that animated video movie was more realistic from its live action counterpart. Every character needs are logical and even the design of Gotham feels like an metropolis buzzing around the clock which is awesome.To the villain of the film !Mr. Freeze I am a big fan of this guy and here they show really well that his criminal actions aren't due to his greed need of vengeance or ego he does them for his wife .Also the fact that he can' hag her o kiss makes you at times feel bad for the fellow and I was rooting for him to get what he wanted. Final and Bonus fact the animation. Two are the facts that decrease the quality of the movie from an awesome story to a solid decent one. The first is the unoriginal of the story and the other the animation it isn't as top notes as an animated film of that universe needs to be. The reason for that is that the Bruce Tim's team tried to use some CGI 'in to the designs and remember it is 1998 and cgi is not a evolve as now so that is the reason. But it isn't awful at least it is just fine.In the end although dated the film is the best interpretation of Mr. Freeze so far and I wish this one will inspire the Warner Bros. to make it in a big Budget live action film somewhere after the Justice League movies for it is a shame to not give a chance to doctor Victor.".

Batman still proves he's the world's greatest detective and every clue is milked until he gets something out of it.  Mr. Freeze though a villain you can sympathize with is still one of the nastiest character's in Batman without using stupid quips like Arnold S. like in that stupid B  R movie.  Every character is interesting and unlike many cartoon's aimed at children not everyone survives though nothing is said of what happened to that surgeon at the end.  I guess he died.  Great movie.  Just don't watch it tired.".

I will always try any of the Batman products because occasionally the films and the cartoons get it right well the odd time. In this case however I didn't feel like it had done a good job of making the cartoon something that could translate to the adult audience.  The plot echoes a part of the Batman  Robin film but like that fails to develop a lot of the darker strands.  It still engages and does enough to entertain but I would have liked the film to look at the complexity of Dr FriesFreeze  he is not a bad guy he is driven by love however the film only part succeeds in letting us understand him.The animation is good for a cartoon but lacks atmosphere for the most part I need shadows and dark colours to echo the material.  However the film is bright and colourful or black it doesn't really do shadows but it just uses black a lot  however the characters are colourful and that goes against the grain of the film.  The voice work is pretty good apart from a few weak links and it's always good to have a voice that rings a bell  in this case it's George Dzundza and Dean Jones.Overall I quite enjoyed this film even though it wasn't really dark enough or complex enough to really satisfy my needs from a Batman story.  However it manages to make more sense that the similar liveaction film and is more enjoyable than that!  It will satisfy older children and adults will be able to sit through it even if they hope for more.".

Presley and his band are hired by the club owner Harold Stone they work for to go to Fort Lauderdale and make sure that his daughter Fabares doesn't get into trouble. This often means cutting the romantic evenings of the band short but Rusty Elvis ends up combining business with pleasure.This is pleasant enough Elvis fare. It's not the kind of movie he wanted to make but thanks to Colonel Parker we have a slew of them part travelogue part music video. Elvis looks great the film has a lot of youthful energy and catches the spring break atmosphere. After the success of Ricky Nelson on television TV stars had to sing and Fabares is no exception and she makes a darling costar for Elvis. Her description during an interview of being told she had to sing by the producer of The Donna Reed Show is quite funny. She refused and was asked Do you want to do the show next year? Former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley is the knockout Rusty tries to romance while on guard duty.

	onyx:emotionText "Elvis Presley and his band are Girl Happy in this 1965 film starring Shelley Fabares and featuring Gary Crosby Mary Ann Mobley Harold Stone Nita Talbot Joby Baker and Fabrizio Mioni. Presley and his band are hired by the club owner Harold Stone they work for to go to Fort Lauderdale and make sure that his daughter Fabares doesn't get into trouble. This often means cutting the romantic evenings of the band short but Rusty Elvis ends up combining business with pleasure.This is pleasant enough Elvis fare. It's not the kind of movie he wanted to make but thanks to Colonel Parker we have a slew of them part travelogue part music video. Elvis looks great the film has a lot of youthful energy and catches the spring break atmosphere. After the success of Ricky Nelson on television TV stars had to sing and Fabares is no exception and she makes a darling costar for Elvis. Her description during an interview of being told she had to sing by the producer of The Donna Reed Show is quite funny. She refused and was asked Do you want to do the show next year? Former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley is the knockout Rusty tries to romance while on guard duty. Rusty's band consisting of Crosby Baker and Hawkins do well in their roles as lascivious lads.I wasn't as taken with the music as some on the board. It was nice but I missed a big hit like Return to Sender. Elvis wanted to leave a more important film legacy. I for one am grateful for any chance to see him perform.";

Elvis and his bandGary Crosby Jimmy Hawkins  Joby Baker are sent by Mr. FrankHarold J. Stone to Fort Lauderdale to keep an eye on Valerie FrankShelley Fabares his daughter. The movie starts with Elivs and his group on stage singing Girl Happygreat song. Then they head off to Fort Lauderdale to keep an eye on Shelley. They sing Spring Fevergreat songtogether with the girls in their cars. There are some great closeups of Shelley's beautiful face in the car. They arrive at the Seadrift Motel. They find out Shelley is a hottie when she goes for a swim. Elvis goes out to sing Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commercegreat song. Shellley in coming out of the pool at the time. We get see her in a two piece swimsuit. Nice Body! Anyway she goes to the club with a nerd that night and leaves with Romana Latin wanting to get romantic. Elvis and his clan find them on his boat and drive it back to their hotel before anything happens. Next day we get a scene with Shelley in a nice looking two piece yellow swimsuit. Ramano takes her back to the hotel for something. The guys get Elvis to intervene. He calls the manager in and he breaks up a card game they are playing. Elvis decides to add her to the act to keep an eye on her. Next scene is Elvis and group singing Meanest Girl in Towngreat song. Shelley comes out in a gold top tied at the bust and black hot pants and high heelsshe has never looked hotter than in this scene. She dances around with a sign reading I'm Evil. With her belly button exposed she does a few more sexy spins and the song ends. She goes in to changetoo bad. That scene is worth a rewind or two. Next Elvis sings Do the Clamgreat song to get her to come to him. He takes her home singing Puppet on a Stringgreat song. About this time his other girl Dina thinks he misses her. Elvis has Shelley to dinner and Dina also shows up. Elvis is very funny here as he tries to keep both women from seeing one another. Elvis and Shelley then have a good time riding dancing and sailing. Finally Shelley gets a phone call from dad and he tells her about sending Elvis to watch her. She goes wild with Romano at a dance club and gets arrested. Elvis tries to break in but is too late. He goes back to the club to sing on the last night. He goes out to pick a girl to take on stage for the last song Girl Happy. Shelley is there and all is forgiven after the Mr. Frank has told Shelley that he really has feelings for her. They go up on stage and dance and kiss. The movie ends happily the way I like. All the songs are top notch and every actor in the film is great. So if you want a happy upbeat movie try Girl Happy Elvis' best movie.".

An unusual and unpredictable happening in one of his movies at this point.Girl Happy is not one of my favourite Elvis movie soundtracks but the title track is OK albeit somewhat faster in speed. There's also the catchy Cross My Heart Hope To Die a duet of Spring Fever which wasn't featured on the original album and the sweet ballad Puppet On A String.It's worth checking out and if it doesn't grab you the first time then maybe it will on a second viewing.".

The movie features a nice soundtrack with Elvis Presley as the lead singer and if you listen carefully to the soundtrack and follow along with the movie the soundtrack carries the plot of the film. The movie has its moments and one funny moment in the movie was a part where Rusty is trying to romance a girl even though he is in a romance with Valerie and he has to keep Valerie out of his motel room well he is romancing this girl.I rated this the same as Jailhouse Rock which is another Elvis movie that is perhaps more wellknown than this one. I liked the soundtrack of this movie because I felt the songs were wellwritten and carried the plot of the movie. However unlike Jailhouse Rock this movie did not require any acting. Any three guys around Elvis' age could have played the parts of Rusty's friends.Girl Happy is a nice movie featuring silly situations and a good soundtrack. It is nothing special by any means but manages to deliver an hour and a half of quality entertainment. This movie is highly recommended for any Elvis Presley fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "With the metaphorical anvil of university exams dangling precariously overhead I decided I needed something to lighten the mood. So I turned to the King Elvis Presley  a man whose legendary talent charm and good looks were sure to brighten my wearied spirits. In this frothy 1960s teen comedy with a stupid title Rusty Presley and his band of sexstarved musicians including Gary Crosby son of Bing are sent down to sunny Fort Lauderdale to chaperone from a distance the daughter of their employer. Though initially unenthusiastic about watching the plainlooking academic Valerie Shelley Fabares the boys quickly change their tune when she lets her hair down and slips into something let's say more appropriate to the Florida climate. Many romantic hijinks consequently ensue including a highspeed boat ride an impromptu beach party involving a completely hideous dance called The Clam a drunken stripclub brawl and a prisonbreak going the wrong way. Most films that try to make a beautiful actress appear plain or bookish usually before a surprising transformation do an absolutely terrible job of it. Here conversely a very pretty Shelley Fabares is made to seem convincingly unappealing in her first few appearances. This illusion is of course quickly abolished as Rusty comes to fall for her intelligent charms even while straying occasionally towards a more conventional pinup girl called Deena Mary Ann Mobley. Though the boys' springbreak romances never get beyond wholesome necking the social attitudes are nevertheless rather liberal with frequent overt references towards sex. Even the nerdy bloke played by Peter Brooks ultimately decides that casual sex is better than finding a girl with a mind. Elvis' performance is laidback and entertaining and Fabares has a fun chemistry with him she would appear in two more movies opposite The King.".

This movie was one of my favorites from my childhood and it is amazing to me how I can still remember the lyrics to these songs after all these years!

	schema:reviewBody "A fun mildy amusing Elvis Presley movie with some not so bad songs Puppet on a String Girl Happy and Do Not Disturb being the best. Elvis plays nightclub singer again! Rusty Wells in Chicago. The Nightclub owner a short tempered loud tough guy known affectionately as Big Frank sends Rusty and his two bandmates to Fort Lauderdale Florida to watch over his gorgeous 21 year old daughter Valerie  played by Elvis' favourite costar Shelley Fabaras in her first of three appearances as an Elvis Girl. The boys follow Val and her two friends to the popular holiday resort in Fort Lauderdale in time for Spring Fever where hundreds of lusty university students flock to in search of fun and romance under strict orders to keep the wolves at bay for Big Frank...or else! The film also stars another beautiful lady as an Elvis love interest former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley who would also appear in The King's next film Harum Scarum. In the midst of trying to enjoy some romance of his own with Ms. Mobley and keep those wolves away from Val Rusty finds himself falling for Val. After spending a fabulous day with Rusty Val speaks to her father on the phone and tells her all about him...only for Frank to spill the beans on the real reason Rusty is there for  to mind her for him. This sends Val over the edge and after a drunken night out ends in a bar brawl and a spell in the local police cell an amusing attempt to get himself arrested to get her out due to a soft natured policeman Rusty finally breaks in to the cell by digging a tunnel in in true prison spoof style! When Big Frank gets wind of his daughter's arrest he arrives in town raging but after a heart to heart with him Val tells her of her feelings for Rusty and after a dazzling performance in the local Club the two are finally United with Big Frank's blessing. Girl Happy is silly sixties fun. It has some funny moments  such as one of the band mates disgust at his girl ditching him for another bloke Where is he!? If I find him I'll break him in half! he brags...as the new body building boyfriend appears and whisks her away. An enjoyable fun film. The girls get Elvis the guys get Shelley Fabaras and Mary Ann Mobley  everyone's a winner!".

If you've seen at least one movie in your life then you'll know where the plot is taking you throughout this film. Elvis is actually decent in his role but leading lady Shelley Fabares is pretty bland which got me wondering why MGM didn't try to get Elvis better leading ladies.

	schema:headline " Indie Filmmaking at its Best  Bong Joon Ho's Understated Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm leaving this review to hopefully attract even the smallest bit of attention to this incredible film that is sadly so hidden to mainstream and fringe film audiences alike. I believe Bong Joon Ho is one of the greatest modern filmmakers who has gained a strong following due to films such as Memories of Murder 2003 a bleak and haunting serialkiller masterwork The Host 2006 a comic and gripping creature feature Mother 2009 an unexpected and layered murder mystery and Snowpiercer 2013 a breathtaking Orwellian SciFi tour de force based on a French graphic novel. If you are new to the world of Bong Joon Ho I highly recommend all of these works. However his debut film Barking Dogs Never Bite 2000 is a much lesserknown work of his but despite its lower budget and smaller scale I believe it to be one of his finest creations.Danny Boyle once said I think your first film is always your best film. Always. It may not be your most successful or your technically most accomplished whatever. It is your best film in a way because you never ever get close to that feeling of not knowing what you're doing again. And that feeling of not knowing what you're doing is an amazing place to be. If you can cope with it and not panic it's amazing. It's guesswork inventiveness and freshness that you never get again. I feel that this quote summarizes why Barking Dogs Never Bite is such an amazing film. It was Bong's passion project and even though he lacked the experience and guidance that makes his later works so great he had a nervous and adventurous tenacity that couldn't be replicated in the future. I definitely believe this to be Bong Joon Ho's most personal film and one that analyzes the interactions between characters. I won't waste time discussing specific plot points or characterscharacter actions that's the film's job. What I do want to share are the subtle themes included throughout the film that have resonated with me.Probably the most prevalent theme throughout the film is chasing one's dreams...or at least what one believes to be one's dreams. Yunju ultimately wishes to gain employment as a college professor and is determined to do whatever is necessary to achieve this goal. But is this surely what he wants or is it just what he thinks he wants? How do we even know what we want in life is what we truly want? It's not like we have achieved that goal to know if it is actually what we were expecting it to be. It is common to have a goal in life in which once achieved doesn't bring as much satisfaction as it was originally speculated to bring. Or it even may end up being something that you didn't want at all. The opening wilderness and closing curtain shots of this film in relation to how they tie into the theme of achieving falsely desired goals is flawless filmmaking. Hyeonnam has a similar experience with achieving desired goals. This film has several set pieces that play off of one another like a domino effect which usually peaks my interest when accomplished properly as it was here. There are also one or two segments of the film that have very little to no relation to the overarching story but were executed incredibly. Specifically one scene where the janitor tells a story about the building's boiler room which introduces such a sudden change of tone but is handled so skillfully. I really appreciate when directors are able to break the conventions of filmmaking like so while still making it work to their benefit. This movie is also absolutely hilarious probably Bong's most comedic but the humor is very dark. That being said there are so many witty honest humane and even sadistic moments that made me laugh and smirk.There are a few warnings that I would like to share. First off there are a few scenes that depict animal cruelty and canine consumption I'm a dog lover so don't think that just because you love dogs you won't be able to watch this movie. However literally the first thing you see when watching this film is text that states No animals were harmed in making this film. You have to remember that at the end of the day you're watching a movie and the events depicted on screen are not real. On the other hand Bong Joon Ho is also portraying how animals specifically dogs are viewed and treated in South Korea. The consumption of dog is not too uncommon and that's a cold hard fact that you'll have to stomach pun intended not only while watching this film but throughout life in general. In short Bong Joon Ho depicts lifestyles that actually exist despite seeming uncommon and harsh to other cultures. Secondly I acknowledge that this film might not be for everyone. This is a small scale and personal dark comedy about human interactions. The pacing is slow there is no action and I wouldn't use pure entertainment as a term to define this film. But if you have patience and are able to give Bong Joon Ho a chance to guide you through his quirky little story I believe this film can provide unique gratification. It may be hard to get your hands on a copy but I highly suggest going through the effort to do so. This is a true gift to cinema even though it's hidden so far beneath all the others that only very few have uncovered it.If you enjoyed this film and want to see which others I recommend or you'd like to see my taste of films to decide if this film would be worth watching for you feel free to check out this list httpwww.imdb.comlistls052767730".

	schema:reviewBody "It's possible that this dark comedy will slip from my memory before too long but as I write this just having viewed the film on home video I have to say it made for an excellent viewing experience. It's rare to see a comedy in this day and age with such an offbeat sense of humor let alone one that keeps viewers guessing so much as to where the plot will head next. There's also a lot of care put into the cinematography and editing of this film adding some extra layers of satisfaction from a cinephilic perspective this is one comedy that doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence and need never be regarded as a guilty pleasure. Specifically the way this issue pinpoints its moment in time regarding Korean culture's evolving relationship with dogs is constantly mined for humor but also provides moments of real insight and touching emotion.I watched this film on the strength of director Bong Joonho's Memories of Murder an excellent thriller with a deep mordant streak. If this previous film had to be nailed down to a genre I'd call it a dark comedy  albeit an extremely idiosyncratic one  but there are effective splashes of the thriller and horror genres throughout not to mention some nicely done surrealistic touches. All in all these two films make me sorely regret missing Bong Joonho's Host at this year's Toronto film fest I've added his name to my short list of Korean directors the others being Park Chanwook Hong Sangsoo and Kim Kiduk to follow closely.".

That's not a bad thing since it brings more vibrancy and tension of the situation especially in the chase scenes.Some people might find themselves disturbed by the scenes with the dogs but there isn't much in it just the fact that they're not treated like your ordinary pet. Try to put yourself into a Korean's point of view where a dog isn't any different from chicken.The comedy element cannot be missed out too. The situations are so hilarious and fresh it felt as if my new eye opened. What's amazing is that these situations look realistic and it's believable.Some marks were deducted because even though the scenes were original and executed well the director failed to put them all together to have some sort of meaning. It's really weird how my favourite scenes are the ones that could've been cut like the toilet paper scene and the ghost story in the basement".

The first thing one sees in this film before even the credits is the reassurance No animals were harmed in making this film  and the warning is needed  at least for dog lovers or overlysensitive souls.The movie tells the tale of a wouldbe professor LEE Sungjae currently laid off until he can bribe his way into a permanent appointment who grows increasingly fed up about yippy dogs in his rather downscale apartment megacomplex. He decides to do something about this  which leads to a chain of increasingly disastrous events. THEN his soontodeliver spouse buys a poodle of her own  which he proceeds to lose. While desperately searching for his wife's dog he runs across a helper BAE Doona  who is looking for the culprit who has caused other neighborhood dogs to disappear.Despite my vast affection for dogs the robust dogrelated humor of this film was nonetheless hilarious. The performances of both leads are firstrate and I would rate BAE Doona's gifts as a physical comedian as being in the league of Lucille Ball. Even so BYUN Heebong a janitor with a very special affection for dogs at least for one specific purpose practically steals the show. Indeed at one point he literally STOPS the show  as he takes five or so minutes to recount leisurely the tale of a ghostly master boiler repairman.The direction and cinematography are as superb as the comic acting and story and dialog. Surprisingly the film ends on a morally uplifting nonsappy nonhackneyed note  as forgiveness is delivered with a lost shoe. If I gave ratings this would get a 10.".

If drama is life with the boring parts cut out then this movie manages to successfully cut nothing out. I suppose that is the beauty of the movie nothing ever seems contrived or pieced together. There are no real villains in this movie nor is it designed for the audience to choose sides. The movie is therefore flat but in this case that is a good thing because it is different.

However when I learned that there will be a Korean Film Festival at the ShangriLa Mall this week I decided this would be the ideal way to introduce myself to that country's films.The movie I caught is had the curious title of Barking Dogs Don't Bite. The action already begins even before the opening titles. A henpecked outofwork Humanities professorwannabe who was so annoyed with a very noisy dog of a neighbor. He got so fed up that one day he decided to get rid of it. From there this funny black comedy of errors unfolds. Somewhere along the way his path intersects with that of a bored but kindhearted bookkeeper who witnessed his crime.There was a lot of light humor regarding the pathetic life situation of the male and female lead characters. There was a joke about a survey about ideal husbands where Humanities grad students ranked 50 even below masons. There was scene where the exasperated husband ingeniously uses toilet paper to settle a bet with his overbearing wife. There was also several scenes showing the interaction of the bookkeeper and her chubby best friend which were quite hilarious.There was however a lot of dark humor as this movie dealt a good deal about killing dogs! There were scenes which were definitely uncomfortable to watch as dogs were seen being maltreated. I'm sure the Western audience would protest about scenes where the dogs were seen being prepared to be cooked! If you are a staunch doglover then this movie is not for you. I do hope that among the Korean words in the closing there is a statement that says that no dogs were harmed in the filming of this motion picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bong Joonho's directorial debut is a cruel yet crazy demented yet hilarious and dark yet light hearted delight that finds the then new filmmaker trying to carve his own distinct narrative style and although it is less refined that his subsequent works it manages to be a fun  engaging sit from start to finish.The story of Barking Dogs Never Bite follows an outofwork individual who irritated by the sound of barking dogs in his apartment building resorts to abducting them. Meanwhile a young girl who works at the apartment complex decides to look into the matter of missing dogs after she receives several complaints from the tenants.Written  directed by Bong Joonho it's amazing just how confidently crafted his first feature film is. Opening with a scene that's going to upset  infuriate many pet lovers Bong only goes forward with his wicked sense of humour coupled with his idiosyncratic set of characters and manages to come up with several memorable moments out of nothingness.The screenplay isn't a weak aspect but it did require a bit more polishing. The apartment building provides an ideal setting for its plot to unfold Camera is skilfully utilised throughout the movie  captures every segment in fine detail Editing tries to balance its numerous subplots  pacing but succeeds only partially while its amusing vibe is kept alive by its adventurous score.Coming to the performances Barking Dogs Never Bite packs an eccentric set of characters all of whom are expertly brought to life by its lively cast and whether it's the dogabducting protagonist his pregnant wife the disengaged bookkeeper her fat roommate building's janitor homeless guy or the yapping dogs every single one of them manage to leave their little footprints in the end.On an overall scale Barking Dogs Never Bite is a fascinating start to Bong Joonho's now revered filmmaking career and makes use of all the storytelling elements that he would go on to perfect in his later films. Treating its subject matter in a bold yet funny fashion giving every character their fair share of screen time and rendered on the film canvas with passion  sincerity Barking Dogs Never Bite is well deserving of a broader audience.".

The apartment building provides an ideal setting for its plot to unfold Camera is skilfully utilised throughout the movie  captures every segment in fine detail Editing tries to balance its numerous subplots  pacing but succeeds only partially while its amusing vibe is kept alive by its adventurous score.Coming to the performances Barking Dogs Never Bite packs an eccentric set of characters all of whom are expertly brought to life by its lively cast and whether it's the dogabducting protagonist his pregnant wife the disengaged bookkeeper her fat roommate building's janitor homeless guy or the yapping dogs every single one of them manage to leave their little footprints in the end.On an overall scale Barking Dogs Never Bite is a fascinating start to Bong Joonho's now revered filmmaking career and makes use of all the storytelling elements that he would go on to perfect in his later films. Treating its subject matter in a bold yet funny fashion giving every character their fair share of screen time and rendered on the film canvas with passion  sincerity Barking Dogs Never Bite is well deserving of a broader audience.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film is incredible. Released in 2000 it ran as a precursor to a trend of 'indie' toned films that would be become standard fair over the last ten years and to an extent lose their freshness. This film still feels as original and fresh 9 years later. Bong JoonHo has created something especially unique and multilayered with this debut.The plot is a based around a small group of characters that live within an apartment block complex. Lee Sungjae plays a wannabe university lecturer who is plagued with the constant yapping of a neighbor's dog. Bae Duna is great as a bored office clerk who wants to be noticed. Byeon Hiebong is exceptionally charismatic as the colorful apartment janitor. All characters are played superbly and each have different personal goals which they struggle with.Bong lets you know right from the beginning he is a master of direction. In the opening scenes Yunju tries to silence a yapping dog Bong is almost immediately playing with the audiences' sense of morals and emotions. Either way it grabs the audience and is truly a clever opening. Bong is not afraid to spend time with each of his characters so much so that at times the film can seem as if it's a series of short films stitched together. Some might point to this a shortcoming but I believe since each character scene has been so carefully crafted and written that I would have been disappointed if Bong had taken any other approach. Scenes have been written not only to be entertaining but also to elaborate on themes raised within the film ie corruption within democracy fame and family values and by the end of the film plots are tied together enough for me to be satisfied. The final scene is subtly book ended with the first in an interesting introspective manner.The cinematography is astoundingly planned and executed. Shots of the bland modernist apartment block are beautifully composed and serves as much as a location as a representation of the characters lives. Long takes are used on many occasions not breaking the mood of a scene and developing a more contemplative atmosphere. The visual structuring of a janitors ghost story is accented with sudden swift camera pans and creeping dollys. Simply the film is beautiful to look at and very comfortable to watch. Bong knows how to use the camera as a powerful storytelling tool.What Bong has created is not necessary a comedy but more of a drama the sweeps from comedic moments to emotionally dramatic as well as surrealist spooky. Bongs abilities are clearly on display as he switches between these genres. The film is multilayered. It is just as much a 'social commentary' on modern Korean life. I love this film for its execution its themes its intelligence and its uniqueness!97100 Harry High Pants.".

Though the beginning of the film clearly states that no animals were harmed in this film animal lovers should be forewarned. There is considerable hankypanky going on with the adorable little creatures. Living in a crowded apartment complex with his pregnant wife YunJu Lee SungJae is attempting to become a full professor at a university but his nerves are frayed by the knowledge that to reach his goal he must give the dean 10000 which is certainly illegal but common practice.He is also kept awake at night by the barking of dogs. Even though the complex forbids pets it has also become so common that nobody says anything about it. Seeing his neighbor's dog alone one day his first thought is to throw the dog off the roof but he is thwarted at the last second by an older woman drying her radishes in the sun. Not willing to let the opportunity go by he brings the dog to the basement and locks him in a wooden closet. The next night however he realizes that he has imprisoned the wrong dog when he hears more barking and sees an old lady walking into her apartment with her little friend but it is too late and a little boy loses his most valued companion.Stealing the right dog this time he succeeds in throwing it off of the roof while HyeonNam Bae DooNa a clerk in the superintendent's office inadvertently observes him with a pair of binoculars. Although she has not seen the culprit's face seeking notoriety and a chance to appear on television HyeonNam runs after him in a classic chase scene filled with pounding drums but is unable to catch him. An element of even darker humor is introduced in scenes showing two janitors in the basement carving up dead dogs to make dog soup. The irony comes full circle however when his wife brings home a cute little dog of her own leading to more mischief but a hint of reconciliation and a new beginning.Though perhaps the idea is stretched a bit too thin for a featurelength film Barking Dogs Never Bite is extremely funny throughout especially scenes with Bae Doona and her chubby girl friend. Bae Doona is one of the most expressive actresses in cinema which is borne out by her later roles in Take Care of My Cat and Linda Linda Linda. Barking Dogs is original engaging and entertaining and points out the problems of young people adjusting to rapid changes in society. Light techno and scintillating jazz music are used pushing the ambiance of the film to new heights.".

You'd think it'd be impossible to laugh at a movie where dogs get hurt but the movie is frequently hilarious. We can't sympathize too greatly with Lee obviously and the film wisely has a second protagonist played by the always remarkable Bae Doona. She witnesses Lee's crime and attempts to do something about it. The plot is nice and twisty always topping itself with its next movement. It's really one of the best written films I've seen in a while. Bong's followups are all very good but they have a weird mixture of drama and comedy. The comedy in them sometimes feels outofplace. That's pretty much his style nowadays. Barking Dogs Never Bite isn't much like them. The comedy and drama are more organically meshed. I think it's a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "It takes a very careful but wildly imaginative mind to come up and film Barking Dogs Never Bite. It's a mind that knows that a story isn't important here and shouldn't be which is a risk for any filmmaker much less a firsttimer like Bong JoonHo was. It's loosely structured around two people Yunju and Hyeonnam who live in an apartment complex and each deal with the rule of 'no dogs' in their own way. As do other tenants like the boilerroom janitor who finds the stray or neardead dogs and makes them as part of soup. And basically JoonHo follows these two main souls one a flaky accountant who loves to be outside and another an aspiring professor who can't stand the sound of dogs barking and decides to do 'something' about it and fashions a very entertaining character study.Moreover than being really great about its characters of whom the filmmaker has the utmost concern and warmth over much like in his film the Host where the hilarity that comes from them and around them would appear to be quite genuine it's just brilliant visual storytelling. I loved seeing how he framed his character hiding in a closet in the boiler room as the janitor comes in and tells his buddy the story of the dead man buried behind two layers of concrete. I loved seeing that chase scene where our main heroine chases after the hero or is it antihero after he does something rather alarming with a small dog. And I just loved the mood of the piece how he rolls in jazz music Cowboy Bebop fan one might think or hope and how on a dime an amusing moment could turn really serious and then back to amusing again sometimes in the same scene  the lonely old lady with the little dog and loads of untended radishes shows that quite clearly.A lot of this could be too quirky and unlikely in other hands and certainly it couldn't be quite done like this in America many in the audience gasped at some of the perilous moments with the dogs  most comparable though still lighter than Amores Perros. But the filmmaker already running out of the gate on his first try sticks with the darker modes of his tale and makes us care about these people even when they're imperfect or just plain stupid or cruel and their own ways of redemption or feeling important to themselves is what counts. It's a comic powerhouse and a serious debut light and dark full of vigor and little moments that are quiet enough for us to see these people like the preprofessor and his pregnant wife with a few sad truths hidden beneath her and that girl's unyielding heart. It's like the ideal datemovie introduction to Asian cinema for Wes Anderson fans.".

I loved seeing how he framed his character hiding in a closet in the boiler room as the janitor comes in and tells his buddy the story of the dead man buried behind two layers of concrete. I loved seeing that chase scene where our main heroine chases after the hero or is it antihero after he does something rather alarming with a small dog. And I just loved the mood of the piece how he rolls in jazz music Cowboy Bebop fan one might think or hope and how on a dime an amusing moment could turn really serious and then back to amusing again sometimes in the same scene  the lonely old lady with the little dog and loads of untended radishes shows that quite clearly.A lot of this could be too quirky and unlikely in other hands and certainly it couldn't be quite done like this in America many in the audience gasped at some of the perilous moments with the dogs  most comparable though still lighter than Amores Perros. But the filmmaker already running out of the gate on his first try sticks with the darker modes of his tale and makes us care about these people even when they're imperfect or just plain stupid or cruel and their own ways of redemption or feeling important to themselves is what counts. It's a comic powerhouse and a serious debut light and dark full of vigor and little moments that are quiet enough for us to see these people like the preprofessor and his pregnant wife with a few sad truths hidden beneath her and that girl's unyielding heart. It's like the ideal datemovie introduction to Asian cinema for Wes Anderson fans.";

He decides to take drastic action.Bong Joonho is a criticallyacclaimed visionary director who has created some of cinema's finest moments be it cinematography editing or storytelling he has made a name for himself and is most definitely one to look out for.

Even though the story seems unadorned this is an incredibly intricate experience featuring compelling visuals brilliant performances smart editing and the foundation of Joonho's unique staging technique. He allows actors to perform with their body eyes and hands as a way of attracting the viewers attention further propelling the story forward. This can be seen in the scene where the Janitor HieBong Byeon is telling the tale of Boiler Kim in the apartment complex basement. Ensemble staging becomes a great part of Joonho's films especially in Memories of Murder but this is where it started. The performances from Sungjae Lee and Doona Bae are satisfyingly entertaining and although never branching out to anything more dynamic they both complement each other well and keep the film running trippingly.Original music by Sungwoo Jo is strangely fitting and enjoyable being a well developed framework that sounds simplistic yet never venturing too far as to distract the viewer.I've said it before and I'll say it again editing is a huge part of any film and so should be treated with absolute care. I imagine Joonho had a watchful eye over Eun Soo Lee in the editing process. There are moments where it's sharp and fastpaced and others slow and steady it all depends on the pace and rhythm of the scene. It's also hard to place the genre of this film it's sold as a dark comedy but here and there are drops of horrorthriller themes which really adds to the originality of this film and aids its director.It was incredibly difficult to come by a copy of this film with English subtitles attached so I only hope the version I watched was accurate and true to the original dialogue. However I feel the experience would stay very much the same without any understanding of the spoken language. It's all told through visuals and bodylanguage which is likely why Bong Joonho's work is so widely respected by most audiences.Verdict I truly believe that anyone studying film or looking to work in the industry should take a look at the work of Joonho if only to gain more of an understanding of how stories can be told not just through words but through movement and emotion. While Barking Dogs Never Bite is a simple concept it's captured beautifully through visuals.Puhran Dah Suh Uigeh Barking Dogs Never Bite 810.".

The Elvis that might have died on the screen in front of your eyes and you might have not even noticed it. Don't let the bright lights and forced smile fool you. It is your duty to lament this vision before you because it is an ugly one.";

Being a novice when it comes to the filmic work of 'The King' I approached this film and his others from a fresh perspective. I guess I was put off by the stigma of corniness that plagues his filmography. After checking out Jaihouse Rock Paradise Hawaiian Style and Spinout I thought I'd give this relative bmovie a look.I enjoyed the pseudo middle eastern soundtrack and expected the visual equivalent here which essentially is what I got. The faux parody element of the film falls by the wayside pretty quick unfortunately and ultimately becomes another vehicle for Elvis' kungfu romancing and spontaneous song performances. Shake Your Tambourine and So Close So Far are the performance highlights and there is some overlooked snappy dialogue. The less said about the creepy Hey Little Girl sequence though the better. My favourite song the Garagelite Animal Instinct was sadly not featured in the film.Its universally looked at as the bottom of the barrel in the career of Elvis but I think its a pretty fun 80 mins or so there are far worse movies out there.".

The answer was quite simply that to Colonel Parker Elvis was a carnival concession. He was getting million dollar offers to keep at the same old formula junk and since Parker had no idea how good movies were made he kept agreeing to the deals while the money was there. Harum Scarum shows the formula at its most derivative. Elvis himself looked bored and distracted at times on screen and even messed up some of his lip synching! The bulk of the songs are strictly for the Pat Boone set and badly out of date before the movie even came out. At a time of rapid change and great excitement in the music world the Beatles made HELP around the same time the music in Elvis' movies did not evolve or change it just got recycled. The sets are also retreads studio back lot leftovers from earlier better movies which look about as authentically middle eastern as a Moroccan restaurant in Brentwood. The costumes are a bad joke and look like I Dream of Jeannie castoffs. Elvis himself spends most of the movie looking foolish and a bit like a Popsicle in lime green pants. Add in a ridiculously predictable handmedown story about intrigue in the palace of the sultan and a few unfunny minor characters and there is not much to like here even for die hard Elvis fans. Even Elvis haters looking for a cheap laugh will find themselves bored by this exercise.".

Usually those were about some mythical kingdom. We don't have mythical kingdoms any more they're not in vogue in Hollywood. Poor Elvis was stuck in genre that was way out of date. Also I don't think anyone had any doubt that when they went to see the Road to Morocco they were seeing a comedy. The gags here just fall flat. Now I doubt Elvis could have gotten Bob Hope but a comedian of Elvis's generation to costar might have brought off the comedy but only might have.Elvis is in good voice but none of the songs from here are especially memorable. Certainly not like Jailhouse Rock or Blue Hawaii.Harum Scarum belongs at the bottom of Elvis's movie credits. Only devoted fans of the King will like this and maybe not even them.".

Widely regarded as one of the King's worst offenders and he was disappointed with the results as he thought before reading the finished script that this would be a welcome change of pace from his established formula. The scenery is a breath of fresh air though we all know it's MGM's back lot for the most part and the film has a bit more of a plot than usual although it's very clumsily handled. The comedy bits are fairly lackluster and the action is rather stiff but the film moves along well with few to no lulls. Elvis has a strong presence but he really doesn't strain himself too much and he receives little support from his fellow costars though Billy Barty most memorable as J.J. MacKuen from Foul Play does induce a few chuckles without a line of dialog. The songs range from pedestrian to very good Kismet and So Close Yet So Far From Paradise and the girls as almost always is the case with Presley films are quite the eye candy. Harum Scarum is not good but it's breezy enough entertainment for fans of Elvis that's not quite as bad as it's reputation suggests. I'd choose this over Stay Away Joe any day of the week.".

Yes even in those days and for thousands of years before movies the main thing is MONEY!! The people making the film simply said This is not our best by any means we are so better than this but since Elvis is in it people will buy it regardless so lets make it cheap and quick because were getting the money anyways They had the spit it out attitude which is what they did so they could move on to the next project and do the same thing to get their money! You can't have the attitude man these people suck!! They knew it sucked when they made it they simply didn't care because they knew the same people who said it sucked while leaving the theater would have just payed to see it.

The people making the film simply said This is not our best by any means we are so better than this but since Elvis is in it people will buy it regardless so lets make it cheap and quick because were getting the money anyways They had the spit it out attitude which is what they did so they could move on to the next project and do the same thing to get their money! You can't have the attitude man these people suck!! They knew it sucked when they made it they simply didn't care because they knew the same people who said it sucked while leaving the theater would have just payed to see it. And what do ya know.they were right. The movie made double it's money!! Elvis doesn't suck non of those people sucked they just didn't care!";

	schema:reviewBody "Immensely popular singer Presley made a surprisingly large amount of films over a decade or so often churning out three per year. The quality was almost never particularly high though there are exceptions but this one has got to be near the bottom of the barrel. In it he plays a martialartstrained singing action hero ! who while screening his latest cinematic opus in The Middle East is enlisted against his will to assassinate the king of a small country. He is drugged and taken to the Lord of Executions where he is told of his assignment. Before he can even figure out what he's going to do he falls for princess Mobley who is the king's daughter though he believes she's a slave girl. Along the way he pairs up with shady character Novello midget pickpocket Barty and a band of belly dancers who care for two wayward orphan children! Even the outline of the plot is ludicrous but it's made worse by stilted acting heinously cheap sets mostly unappealing costuming drab dull unmemorable songs and anemic direction. Presley is handsome as usual but is saddled with some really bad looking green pants and is forced to contend with a terrible script and save one a plethora of hopelessly routine songs. It is generally agreed that So Close Yet So Far From Paradise is the best song in the film and the most passionately performed one. For some reason his marblemouthed twang during dialogue is more apparent in this film than in practically any other. Mobley tries valiantly to mask her Mississippi origins and looks quite stunning much of the time but her character is mostly decoration. Ansara seems to be taking his role rather seriously which is more than most of the cast could say but it's possible he was wasting his energy as the film is so inept and insultingly bad. Novello and Barty bring their usual brand of mugging and maneuvering to the film which is a matter of taste. A very severe and overstated Jeffries plays a duplicitous seductress. She wears a knockout dress in her first scene but by the end is garbed in a silly onepiece job with a scarf on. Aside from Mobley's sparkly and skimpy princesswear the majority of the clothing is unattractive and cheaplooking none more so than the Executioner's guards who wander around in skintight black headgear looking more like Stooges than threatening killers. Some viewers may be interested in seeing tragic actress Benet as a belly dancer. As for the direction Nelson films nearly everything in a static dull fashion with only minor exceptions. The entire film has a why bother? pallor hanging over it and really isn't even fun on a camp level. The one rather striking and potentially offensive scene apart from any offense some audiences may have at seeing Arabian culture depicted the way it is is a jawdropping sequence featuring Presley and little orphan girl Malkin. Singing a song that clearly was intended to refer to someone older and with lyrics like take you home with me and so on Presley watches as this preteen girl with slits in her dress that are WAISTHIGH gyrates and flounces around fauxseductively. Obviously no direct sexual misconduct was intended here but it's still a really bizarre and certainly wildly politicallyincorrect moment sure to invoke discomfort in some viewers. It's also just about the only thing in the film that can guarantee that the audience is awake!".

No one is really taking any of this movie seriously least of all the star while his co stars are happy just to be working. Like all the Elvis movies of the 60's this made money despite very weak production values and timid list of songs except for one So Close Yet So Far written by Joe Byers this is one of the least known most under rated songs ever to be recorded by Elvis and it has long been a big favourite with me.

A far cry from the good films that Elvis made such as 'King Creole' 'Flaming Star' 'Jailhouse Rock' 'Viva Las Vegas' and 'Loving You' which looked good had great soundtracks great supporting casts and showed that Elvis could be a very capable actor when his material allowed it even when the dialogue and stories were in a few cases not strong suits 'King Creole' was a notable exception though.The film is not irredeemable. It boasts two good songs Go East Young Man and particularly the sublime So Close Yet So Far From Paradise and Elvis sings very well. Despite being in not particularly well written roles Mary Ann Mobley and Fran Jeffries are attractive and appealing in presence. 'Harum Scarum' does pick up a little in energy at the end when things get more eventful but at the same time it feels like too little too late.On the other hand Elvis doesn't look like his heart was in it at all while Michael Ansara Phillip Reed and Theodore Marcuse similarly go through the motions in very obviously written villain roles. Then there is Jay Novello who mugs embarrassingly as perhaps the most annoying sidekick character in an Elvis film. Billy Barty is in a nonspeaking but significant role that comes over as so bizarre and barely relevant that he could easily have been cut.Apart from two songs the rest of the soundtrack isn't all that good and in fact instantly forgettable and feel randomly placed. Faring worst are the throwaway Shake Your Tambourine and especially Hello Little Girl which is something of an unintentionally creepy disaster. Most are indifferently directed with the static direction of Gene Nelson doing them no favours. 'Harum Scarum' doesn't even the distinction of looking good clearly looking like it was made in haste on a low budget judging from the flat photography exotic but recycled sets and cheaply garish costumes.When it comes to the writing and story 'Harum Scarum' is a mess in both areas. Even those not expecting much from the script in the first place will groan in embarrassment at the nonstop clumsily written clichs contrivances and eyerolling corniness. Even for a late lowbudget Elvis vehicle the story is wildly improbable and it is hard to forgive when so much of the film is so strained dramatically and tedious in pacing.In summary hokey and disappointing film and one of Elvis' worst. 310 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "As a Presley fan this film plumbs the depths of bad acting and casting. The script if you call it that is so threadbare that you will snooze off within minutes. The cast look disinterested and frankly not one of them shows any real acting ability. With a ludicrous story line and the lead who looks totally out of his depth forget this film.

The cast look disinterested and frankly not one of them shows any real acting ability. With a ludicrous story line and the lead who looks totally out of his depth forget this film.

	schema:reviewBody "For me Harum Scarum is a prime example of different people having different opinions...I honestly don't think this is THAT bad really. I'm an Elvis fan so I can be accused of bias but I didn't think every film Elvis did was top notch. I'm not a western kind of guy so Flaming Star Love Me Tender and Charro but I think Harum Scarum is far more enjoyable and attention keeping than Girls!Girls! Girls! The Trouble with Girls Tickle Me and even Blue Hawaii...like I say different people have different tastes. I know Priscilla Presley certainly doesn't like Harum Scarum she slates it in her autobiography Elvis and Me and even The King's Manager Colonel Tom Parker didn't like this and he was the man responsible for holding Elvis back in Hollywood. Once again Mary Ann Mobley appears as the leading lady looking even more beautiful than she did in Girl Happy as a king's daughter while another beauty  actress and nude model Fran Jefferies also has a starring role as one of the villains. The director was the dancer and musical director Gene Nelson and the set was used in a Laurence of Arabia type movie earlier. In Harum Scarum Elvis plays actor singer and martial arts Hollywood star Johnny Tyrone who is kidnapped by naive sheik's who believe Tyrone's movie skills where he can kill a tiger with his bare hands are real and they want him to kill a king so they can take over control. Once held captive Tyrone attempts to escape and return to America. En route he meets and is smitten by Mary Ann Mobley and his escape plan soon makes way for plan B as he plots to save the King from the evil assassins and win the heart of his daughter. The soundtrack is not bad. They only song I'm not fond on is Shake That Tambourine. Kismet and Golden Coins are fine songs but all are nowhere near the sublime So Close Yet So Far from Paradise. A real hidden Gem from Elvis' movie soundtracks and one of my top 10 Elvis songs he ever recorded it's a shame it had to appear in one of his most critically panned movies thus gets so criminally overlooked.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harum Scarum gives even secondrate Elvis movies a bad name. If you're counting Harum Scarum was Elvis' nineteenth opus coming between Tickle Me and Frankie and Johnny. Reportedly lensed in a mere 18 days Harem Scarum combines routine musical numbers with a pedestrian Arabian Nights adventure. Virtually everything about Kissin' Cousins director Gene Nelson's atrocious epic reeks of inconsistency. Not for an instant is anything about it believable. One minute everything is lighthearted nonsense and then the next minute everything becomes serious. Only the villain dies and he perishes in a burst of machine gun fire. Inevitably Elvis croons some lackluster tunes. This forgettable Sam Katzman produced potboiler unfolds in an imaginary Middle East that has little to do with the real Middle East. Mind you for the sake of costcutting everything was shot on backlot MGM soundstages instead of actual locations in the Middle East. American celebrity superstar Johnny Tyrone Elvis Presley has agreed to represent the U.S. State Department on a goodwill tour of the Arab nation of Babalstan. The Ambassador and he have arranged a premiere of his latest cinematic swashbuckling saga Sands of the Desert for a wellheeled audience of dignitaries and their dates. These misguided people actually believe that the onscreen Elvis hero is as formidable as the offscreen Elvis. Elvis relies on his considerable karate skills to dispose of a leopard that stands between him and a bound princess in the movie shown them.Oxford educated scenarist Gerald Drayson Adams had earlier written swashbucklers like The Golden Horde The Desert Hawk and The Prince Was A Thief so he knew all the right tropes to cover. He serves up clichs galore as our handsome darkhaired hero accepts an invitation from sinister Prince Dragna Michael Ansara of Sol Madrid to enjoy the hospitality of his older brother King Toranshah in Lunarland. Notsurprisingly his fictional country is surrounded by rock formations know as the Mountains of the Moon. Predictably U.S. Ambassador McCord Hugh Sanders of Mr. 880 is flabbergasted by Prince Dragna's gracious offer. Johnny this is a tremendous honor. Do you realize that you're the first American His Majesty King Toranshah has ever invited into his kingdom? Dragna's date Aishah Fran Jeffries provides additional information for Johnny's benefit When you cross theMountains of the Moon into our country Mr. Tyronne you'll be stepping back 2000 years. You will find the pageantry and beauty almost unbelievable. Strangely enough the villains in Lunarland carry vintage World War II British submachine guns so 20th century smugglers must have penetrated its boundaries. No sooner has he flown over a rugged range of mountains and ridden on horseback through the wilderness does Johnny find himself drugged by the beautiful Aishah abducted by the notorious Arab Sinan a baldheaded Theo Marcuse chief of a band of Assassins and forced to assassinate King Toranshah Phillip Reed so Prince Dragna can negotiate oil deals. Of course Elvis falls in love with Toranshah's daughter the gorgeous Princess Shalimar former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley but he entangled himself in local intrigue with a con artist Zacha Jay Novello and his band of thieves. Longtime Elvis bodyguard Red West plays one of Sinan's henchmen. Naturally the girls look sexy the surroundings brightly lighted and script about as serious as a comedy. Only the most diehard Elvis fans will find this palatable and the King warbles his way through this crap without a shred of credibility.".

Strangely this film provided Elvis with two female costars who had genuine star quality  Fran Jeffries and Mary Ann Mobley.

If only Fran Jeffries had been provided with a few dance routines the film may have had a redeeming feature. Lastly I am always struck by the fact that this impossibly handsome and healthy man would within a few years become a bloated parody of himself. Where did he go? Were films like Harum Scarum a sinister foreshadowing of a lost personality or am I reading too much into it? Did I really discern hints of selfloathing in his performance in this film?

That was ahead of its time I think Bruce Lee would be on TV after this in the Green Hornet that Elvis knew how to spot trends way ahead of the rest. I say in my review title its like Star Trek well if you look there's the Klingon Commander and also the evil guy was in another Trek episode Catspaw plus the sets look like the same ones used in a Trek episode where they were on some planet. Even the titles used were straight out of I Dream of Jeanie Barbara Feldon was married to that same Klingon dude Michael Ansara in real life lol. Well thats about all of that. The fact that they are in Warestan means no Blondes so I liked seeing all the brunettes and Billy Barty kicks some butt against hordes of knife wielding 6 foot dudes so thats amusing not really. Check out Elvis in a Vegas show at the end man was that what I missed by not being old enough to see him in Vegas? He looked like a stick clearly he wasn't happy doing this one. Still I give it a 5 on Elvis's movie scale 10 I guess would be Jailhouse Rock I don't know what 1 would be but than again its not like I go out of my way to watch Elvis movies. To think it's 1965 only like 2 years out from the British invasion the times they were a changin fast and left Elvis behind didn't they?".

Still the plot  thin as it is  emerges to be quite engaging what with its backdrop of fortunetelling gambling parlors variety acts and costume parties and involving mistaken identities misunderstandings an attempted murder and a barroom brawl! The cast presents three notable female roles Donna Douglas as Frankie Nancy Kovack as Elvis redheaded lucky charm and the flame of his jealous boss and Sue Ane Langdon as a ditzy blonde  who along with Presleys longsuffering sidekick Harry Morgan turns out to be the most likable character as well as the purveyor of the films comic relief.Elvis best new number is Hard Luck apart from the title tune he also gets to sing the standard When The Saints Go Marching In while dressed in full military regalia! The film is short enough at 87 mins. not to overstay its welcome but the rather lowkey presentation also prevents it from being anything more than unassuming entertainment. I wouldnt classify it among the topflight Presley vehicles therefore but its certainly superior to some of the biggerbudgeted yet simpleminded fluff he made over at MGM  this being a production from independent producer Edward Small released through United Artists.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie followed Harum Scarum and was a big step up simply because Harum Scarum was arguably Elvis's worst movie. This one is actually the closest thing that Elvis ever did to a typical Hollywood musical like Music Man. There's an interesting plot and some good energy that carries through the first half of the movie but it limps along badly in the second half. I went to sleep and had to finish watching it the next morning.The large amount of Broadway musicaltype tunes simply doesn't fit Elvis' style very well. Only the title tune is really interesting and works very well. At the end there is a gem called Please Don't Stop Loving Me. It comes at about 80 minutes of the film's 87 minute run and I'm not sure that anybody except Elvis fans will last that long.Apparently Donna Douglas and Elvis had deep philosophical conversations on Paramahansa Yogananda and the Christian religion during the breaks while shooting this movie. This shows as there is very little chemistry between them. Second lead Nancy Kovack provides whatever sexual chemistry the film does have. One suspects that if Douglas and Kovack had changed roles the film would have worked much better.This doesn't fit into the category of Elvis' good movies but it also doesn't fit into the category of his bad movies. Lets just say that it is an okay movie that only Elvis fans will find pleasurable.".

I was pleasantly surprised to see how good this little film was although it suffers from the same issues as many Elvis films of this period. The story is incredibly weak and once again we've gotta see The King fall for the wrong woman and try to get himself out of trouble while singing. What stands this film apart from the others through are the incredibly well done songs which also feature some great musical numbers. The highlight is the wonderfully played out title song as well as several other tunes including What Every Woman Lives For Down By the Riverside When the Saints Go Marching In and Hard Luck. Elvis doesn't give what I'd call a good performance but he fits his role well as the dumb but entertaining singer. The biggest credit must go to the supporting cast with Douglas stealing the show and Harry Morgan adding great comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Falling close to the middle of Presley's film career in both quantity and quality this is an exercise in mediocrity with only a few things to recommend in it. Very loosely inspired by the classic title song it showcases Presley as a riverboat performer and gambling addict. He has a relationship with his singing partner Douglas but that is strained to the limit when he encounters Kovack a redhead who he believes is essential in fulfilling his gypsy fortune to win big money at the roulette wheel. Unfortunately Kovack is the onetime love of Presley's boss Eisley and he isn't quite ready to give her up yet despite his own affair with kooky chorine Langdon. More direct comedy is provided by Morgan and Christie as Presley and Douglas' married friends. The shenanigans including mistaken identity flirtation drunkenness and the roller coaster of the roulette wheel all come to a head during a performance of the title song during which Presley's life is endangered. What may sound lively and entertaining in description is only partly so in reality. The pace of the film borders on stagnant despite the setting and the many songs Presley performs are chiefly forgettable and unimaginatively staged. Presley is close to his physical prime here though his performance lacks any real spark. His infamous jetblack hair which fails to ever move except for one cowlick in front is incongruous with the time period as are several of his costumes. It's surprising to see Douglas in a role other than her iconic Elly Mae Clampett. She is unable to ditch the accent from that character despite obviously trying to at various points. She is lovely to look at most of the time but is obviously uncomfortable in the musical sequences in which her voice is dubbed and her movements are lacking in assurance. Morgan does a decent job but Christie manages to outshine him with her caustic brand of dry humor. They share some of the movies most amusing bits. Langdon is as usual very broad in her role though she does contribute some energy to the proceedings. Eisley is adequate. Nothing more. Kovack is attractive but like Douglas far from seeming at home in the musical interludes. The songs are mostly forgettable and the one major song the title tune which has endured for so long is rather mangled by switching it from a narrative style to a firstperson number with people singing about themselves. Few things are as uncomfortablelooking as Presley loping down the street in his marching band getup. Though the film has many colorful costumes and settings it comes off as pretty cheaplooking. Fans of The King will still want to watch this for his brand of light romance and comedy but it hardly ranks as one of his best outings.".

	schema:headline " even devoted admirers of Elvis will find themselves feeling shortchanged by this one";
	schema:reviewBody "Frankie and Johnny is one in the long line of musicals which Elvis Presley churned out in the sixties. It has no connection with the Al PacinoMichelle Pfeiffer film of the same name from 1991 but is instead fairly loosely based upon the wellknown American folksong. It is set some time in the late nineteenth century probably around 1880 or 1890 although the exact date is never stated. Johnny and his girlfriend Frankie are performers on a Mississippi riverboat Johnny is also a compulsive gambler and as the boat has a casino on board he has plenty of opportunities to gamble. The film deals with the complications caused in their relationship by Johnny's gambling habit and Frankie's jealousy of his friendship with an attractive redhead named Nellie Bly. Johnny's interest in Nellie arises from the fact that a gypsy fortuneteller has informed him that a redhaired woman will bring him luck but the jealous Frankie suspects that their relationship goes much deeper.One of the problems of casting a rock star in a Victorian period drama is that rock didn't actually exist in the Victorian era. The makers of this film are not really all that concerned with period accuracy some of the music we hear sounds suspiciously like jazz which didn't really exist in the 1880s and even the song Frankie and Johnny itself was not published in its modern form until the 1920s. Somebody however obviously realised that rockandroll would be anachronistic so the star gets to sing a series of bland totally forgettable easylistening numbers.Elvis was always fairly laidback as an actor but in this film he doesn't seem to make much effort as a singer either being content just to stroll his way through the film. The rest of the cast are no better in his film career Elvis played opposite some pretty obscure leading ladies but Donna Douglas is one of the least memorable of the bunch. I was not surprised to discover that this was the last film she made in a brief cinema career. About the complicated and often farfetched plot the less said the better. Most Elvis Presley films these days are unlikely to appeal to anyone other than his many devoted admirers but I suspect that even they will find themselves feeling a bit shortchanged by this one. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "Elvis Presley was a hugely influential performer with one of the most distinctive singing voices of anybody. He embarked on a film career consisting of 33 films from 1956 to 1969 films that did well at the boxoffice but mostly panned critically especially his later films and while he was a highly charismatic performer he was never considered a great actor.This said a good deal of his earlier efforts late 50searly 60s were actually pretty good and more his best being 'King Creole' 'Flaming Star' 'Jailhouse Rock' 'Viva Las Vegas' and 'Loving You'. Those films looked good had great soundtracks great supporting casts and showed that Elvis could be a very capable actor when his material allowed it even when the dialogue and stories were in a few of them were not strong suits 'King Creole' was a notable exception though. Am of the opinion that Elvis' film career was an uneven film while there were good films and performances there were also bad films where he looked bored where the films had not so good soundtracks and looked cheap a notable example being his previous film 'Harum Scarum' widely considered one of his worst for good reason.'Frankie  Johnny' is towards the lesser half of his filmography while not quite among his very worst. It is better than 'Harum Scarum' then again a lot of things are but still contains a lot of things that make some of Elvis' mid60s onwards films not so good.Starting with its good things most of the songs fare well especially the title song Hard Luck Shout it Out the most energetically performed of the songs and Please Don't Stop Loving Me. Didn't think much of the performances this time around but a couple of actors come off with flying colours. Best of the bunch is Harry Morgan who really brings a smile to one's face. Audrey Christie is also a lot of fun and Donna Douglas is a competent leading lady.The riverboat setting has moments where it's attractive enough and some of the first half is brightly and breezily paced.However Elvis spends the whole time looking as if he didn't want to be there despite singing beautifully as always while the chemistry between him and Douglas lacks spark or passion. Nancy Kovack and Anthony Einsley are on autopilot in very colourlessly written roles and in general much of the acting is barely halfhearted. Although the soundtrack is mostly good several of Elvis' 60s films had at least one song that was disposable. In 'Frankie  Johnny's' case there are two that in no way pass muster as good songs and don't feel necessary those being Chesay and Petunia the Gardener's Daughter.Dubbing is also an issue Elvis' lip synchronisation is sloppy and it was far too obvious that it wasn't Douglas and Morgan singing their own music the difference between speaking and singing is blatant and distracting and Douglas doesn't look at ease. The way the numbers are staged varies Hard Luck Please Don't Stop Loving Me and Shout It Out are fine but most of the rest are fairly static and seriously repeating footage of the title number in the reprise of the finale was not clever and just screamed of trying and failing to hide running out of time and budget.Apart from the attractive riverboat setting 'Frankie  Johnny' is another Elvis film that looks like it was made on the cheap and in haste with a lot of garish and lurid colours cheaplooking and anachronistic costumes and a flat made for TVlike look to the photography. The direction is at best lifeless especially in the very limply paced second half. It is in the second half too where the story becomes increasingly farfetched and less easy to follow and the dialogue increasingly groanworthy even for those expecting that in the first place.Overall semiwatchable and okay at best time filler but Elvis was worthy of so much more than this. 410 Bethany Cox".

It's a period song and dance musical set aboard a show boat seems instantly dated and Elvis seems way ahead of it in time period. It's all about the issues between singing gambler Elvis his long suffering girlfriend Donna Douglas and the threats of a gypsy prediction. I wish that they had predicted that costar Harry Morgan wouldn't sing and proved to be right. No such luck. If I look at this as one of the many non MGM musicals of the early 1950's I could have tolerated the simplistic atmosphere that was out of step in 1966. Even the traditional musical films of that time had modern elements the ones here had been in use in the mid to late 1930's. The only difference is that when Elvis sings and shows off his lacquered hair you're transferred out of the era of the setting of the story and right back into a dress up party in 1966. With Audrey Christie as Morgan's nagging wife making them a copycat version of Show Boat's Captain Andy and Party Nancy Kovack as Nellie Bly the threatening redhead and Sue Ann Langdon as ditsy Mitzi this takes the legend of Frankie and Johnny to cheeky level with Kovack attractive but seemingly a bit long in the tooth to be the femme fatale. Robert Strauss adds another cad to his list of villains. As Frankie Donna Douglas grows some claws every time Kovack is around almost making you forget that she's the ingenue on a popular sitcom. For me the only way to not dismiss this was to look past the silliness and enjoy the production numbers the only one other than Viva Las Vegas to feature them. The title song is a little nasal for my taste but a few takes on traditional American music made a huge difference.".

Timothy Spall gives a devastating performance as a decent man engaged in the loneliest of professions. The title is somewhat misleading. Hangings were carried out until 1964 but Pierrepoint was the last man to hold the official office of Chief Executioner.As the film begins Pierrepoint is proud to be offered a job as a hangman following in his father's and uncle's footsteps. Since he's only needed every few months he maintains his job as a grocer's deliveryman and keeps his moonlighting a secret from his friends and even his wife Juliet Stevenson. He is very good at his new profession and is determined to complete each job as quickly and humanely as possible. It's a bit odd seeing him trying to shave seconds off the time required for each execution much like a professional athlete trying for a world record. That is until you realize that his desire is for the prisoner to have as little time as possible to be afraid. After each execution it falls to Pierrepoint to cut down the body and prepare it for burial and it's touching to see the tenderness he displays. After the execution of one woman he tells his assistant She's paid the price now she's innocent.Pierrepoint's reputation grows and after the war he's flown to Germany by the British Army and placed in charge of executing scores of Nazi war criminals. As a result his secret is leaked to the press who now broadcast his identity as the finest hangman in the land. With his earnings from these jobs he and his wife decide to open a pub! which does a booming business thanks in part to his notoriety.But the job begins to take a terrible toll. Even after he tells his wife about his second profession she doesn't want to hear about it. Nobody really wants to hear about it. When protesters start demonstrating against capital punishment Pierrepoint finds himself the target of their ire. Doubts begin to creep in to destroy his previously unshakable faith in what he does. By the mid1950s Albert Pierrepoint resigns his position ostensibly over unpaid fees and completely reverses his own position on capital punishment though he initially keeps his opinions to himself. In his 1974 autobiography however he finally confesses that the whole experience had left a bitter aftertaste for him and that he felt that capital punishment had achieved nothing but revenge.Though this is a fairly standard biopic and issue film the performances of Juliet Stevenson and especially Timothy Spall are remarkable. Pierrepoint's determination to remain detached takes a terrible toll on his life and is bound to fail eventually. The obvious conclusion is that killing corrodes our humanity whether the killer is a murderer or an executioner on the state's payroll.".

Titled Pierrepoint here in the UK this is a case of another quality British film being routinely ignored by the multiplexes in favour of the usual fodder presented for the masses. I was confident my regular audience would be interested by this true story of mass executioner Albert Pierrepont who really was 'a household name' in the 50s and 60s. In actual fact Mr Pierrepoint was NOT 'the last hangman' in the UK. It really is a remarkably entertaining picture considering the obviously dour storyline much aided by the portrayal of charismatic star Timothy Spall who can be relied upon to always give an interesting and engrossing performance. Mr Spall is no matine idol lead but not many would argue he is one of the most popular actors in Britain today. The film explains how Albert followed in the same 'career' of his father and Uncle Tom who is briefly portrayed in the film and interestingly reveals the technical side of his skillful and efficient methods for a successful result! Along the way Albert is seen with Field Marshal Montgomery who personally recommended Pierrepoint to carry out the Nuremburg executions as well as other familiar people such as Timothy Evans Derek Bentley and Ruth Ellis all of whose cases fed the argument for the abolition of capital punishment. In the film much dramatic use is made of Pierrepoint's execution of his friend 'Tish' who often sang duets with Albert in the latter's pub. This really is true very much a case of stranger than fiction. This film is strangely entertaining never dull although I noted some of the female members of my audience were regularly looking downwards whenever a hanging was shown. However afterwards there many favourable comments about this film and we were still talking about it at the post show drink in the pub afterwards! Obviously achieved on a very restricted budget but a film to be recommended.".

The clock strikes nine and the hangman goes to work getting rid of criminals the old fashioned way. At the end of the day he puts on his cap and heads home to his wife like any other man. But what goes on in the head of an ordinary person who's job it is to kill? This is the question asked by Adrian Shergold the director of The Last Hangman.The film follows the true story of the rise of Britain's most prolific executioner Albert Pierrepoint and his struggle to be a lead a normal life. Pierrepoint is played by Timothy Spall most noted for his great supporting roles in Vanilla Sky and The Last Samurai. Spall shines in this film becoming both a calculating intense killer and a jolly pub mate. As the film progresses he literally transforms as his burden becomes greater. Juliet Stevenson plays Annie Albert's arguably supportive wife. She portrays the guilt and paranoia of an English housewife painfully well. Through her we see the full story of the couple's social and moral difficulties.Pierrepoint's only real drive is that of any honest hard working man. He just wants to be good at what he does. This keeps the audience in a emotionally conflicting state. The viewer desperately wants Albert to resign from his chilling career while cheering on his incredible success.The film is very nice to look at. What a feat. One can only imagine the difficulty of shooting a period piece independently. It was very interesting seeing the gritty grey streets of a wartime London recorded on 16. It seemed to give it a charming modern context though there were jarring out of focus shots here and there. One memorable scene is brilliantly spliced with actual footage of a capital punishment protest.Aside from the physical shooting of the film there were strong symbolic devices at use. In order to hang someone efficiently Pierrepoint would calculate the prisoner's height and weight. To do this he would look through a small peephole in the heavy cell door. Whenever anyone is shown through a crack or a hole it's a hint of grizzly foreshadowing. The method of passing time was artfully portrayed as well. Pierrepoint kept a logbook of all the people who he killed their names written in perfect script. The stack of logbooks got bigger and bigger as years went by.Films like The Last Hangman are important because they challenge our choices. This story makes us think of what we're responsible for in our lives and careers. Is the success worth the death of your inner self? That decision is up to us. Because the saddest thing about Albert Pierrepoint is that he applied for the job.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pierrepoint is one of those films you go to see having no idea what to expect which makes the film's masterful performances and brilliantly dark style all the more intriguing to watch. The performances of Spall and Stevenson are undoubtedly the best part of this film. Spall's portrayal of his character's struggle to remain detached from his work after losing his anonymity is definitely his strongest performance to date and Stevenson conveys the dynamics of their marriage beautifully. These performances make the film entirely believable throughout particularly in the grizzly execution scenes. These scenes are shot in a brutally uncompromising way a style which seems to reflect the nature of capital punishment itself.The film manages to convey its anti capital punishment message effectively and in a rather more restrained way than other recent issue films. Where films such as Crash and Brokeback Mountain are inclined to blare out their loud and rather unsubtle themes Pierrepoint takes a quieter more objective viewpoint leaving the audience to make up their own minds. I have consequently heard this film criticised for not taking a strong enough stand against capital punishment. However this objective and uncoloured account of the executions seems to appropriately reflect the cold and indifferent mood that dominates the first half of the film. In short Pierrepoint is a brilliantly performed wonderfully dark film that is probably one of the best things to come out of British cinema in the last decade.".

	schema:reviewBody "Capital punishment in Great Britain was abolished in 1964. Prior to that date there were many Home Office appointed Hangmen none more prolific than Albert Pierrepoint who served from 1932 to 1956 during which time he hanged an estimated 433 men and 17 women. Following his father Henry and uncle Thomas into the family 'trade' Pierrepoint became the number one hangman in Britain and his career brought him into contact with many notorious criminals including Lord HawHaw Germany Calling real name William Joyce John George Haigh the famous acid bath murderer Derek Bentley still a controversial case and the subject of the 1991 film LET HIM HAVE IT Ruth Ellis the last woman to be hanged in Britain and again the subject of a movie DANCE WITH A STRANGER 1985 gangster Antonio Babe Mancini Theodore Schurch the last person to be executed for treason in Britain. Perhaps the most controversial case in Pierrepoint's career was that of Timothy Evans whose wife and baby daughter had been found murdered at their home at 10 Rillington Place also the home of one John Reginald Christie. Evans was executed in 1950. Christie was later charged with the murders of seven women and hanged in 1953. Evans was eventually granted a posthumous pardon in 1966. Evans was played harrowingly by John Hurt in the 1971 movie 10 RILLINGTON PLACE with Richard Attenborough as a chilling Christie according to John Hurt on the DVD commentary for 10 RILLINGTON PLACE Pierrepoint himself actually offered his services under an assumed name as technical adviser for the hanging scene in that film as the actual method was covered by the Official Secrets Act and ever the professional Pierrepoint wanted it recreating accurately and nor would he have wished his work to be misrepresented.Pierrepoint's body of work if you'll forgive the expression was greatly affected by World War II and he worked all over Europe including Germany Cyprus Gibraltar and Austria. It is believed that in 1945 he hanged 190 men and 10 women war criminals at Hameln prison in the British controlled sector of Germany including Irma Greese Elizabeth Volkenrath Juana Boreman and the Beast of Belsen Josef Kramer. During the war itself he had assisted his uncle Thomas in the execution of 16 American soldiers condemned by Court Martial for murder and rape at a military prison in Somerset. The movie carefully portrays Pierrepoint the man not Pierrepoint the executioner. When he does his work he leaves Albert Pierrepoint outside. He is totally professional he doesn't care who they are or what they've done all that matters to him is that they are human beings who have to die and he will achieve that as quickly and humanely as possible. All that matters to him is height weight and physical condition. He is also portrayed as compassionate. When organising the order of the hanging of the German war criminals he selects a girl who has just accused him of doing the Jews work for them to be hanged first. His army assigned assistant agrees as she's an 'arrogant bitch'. 'No' says Pierrepoint 'she's the youngest. She'll be the most frightened.' And after the deed he insists that the remains be treated with due reverence 'They've paid the price. They're innocent now. D'y'see?' The publicity surrounding the Nazi war criminals disturbs Pierrepoint as people applaud him in the street and buy him drinks in the newly acquired pub owned by himself and his wife. This isn't right to him. What he does his job is private he does not even discuss it with his wife. All this attention isn't right. Also there is now an ever growing movement opposed to capital punishment. To some he is a national hero to an increasing number of others he is a murderer. He starts to question his role. Timothy Spall known as a dry comedic actor on British TV AUF WIEDERSEHEN PET and usually the slimy slightly dopey comic villain in movies like HARRY POTTER and LEMONY SNICKETT is mesmerising as Pierrepoint. He portrays a quiet gentle man and one who regards his profession with honour and pride. He is appointed by the Government he is the best in the land. His is not to question the law or the decisions of the lawmakers his is to do his duty to the best of his ability. And he does. Only when his own notoriety the hanging of his friend and the changing mood of the country toward capital punishment creep into the melting pot does his resolve start to falter and only when the various prison authorities start haggling over payments for his services something he sees as an insult to his position as Chief Executioner does he consider resigning which of course he finally does. There are a few historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies such as the main fact that he was not the last executioner. Capital Punishment continued for another eight years after Pierrepoint's resignation but this is the norm for this kind of movie and on the whole the film is as accurate as any film covering over 20 years in 90 minutes. The acting is excellent in all quarters particularly Juliet Stevenson though Spall leads by a length. The period is very well captured and is a close cousin to VERA DRAKE in this respect. The main thing about this movie is that it lingers with you and makes you want to think and learn more about its subject. With Pierrepoint's 'clients' having played such a large part in cinema history it's time we had a movie about the man himself. And this is it. Recommended.".

The other great element of a quality film is that it can be interpreted in many different ways by its viewers.It shouldn't be explained as a portrayal of a man who hanged people although that is exactly what he did what made him famous and what he will be remembered for.For me Pierrepoint is more about working life. The job was always going to be a vocation as his father had been a hangman before him and he wanted to live up to a man he admired. We see the ends that he goes to to be the best in his chosen field and I must admit I thought this was shown brilliantly his care his attention to the task his desire to see the job done right. In the period of time that this story is set your job was something you took pride in not something you exploited to get better money and benefits while doing as little effort as possible.It is impossible to be completely accurate when making a biographical film as you are condensing a persons lifetime into a couple of hours of screen time so therefore the director writers editor and producers need to shorten edit and take a certain amount of artistic license.Fortunately I knew nothing about Albert Pierrepoint before I watched this film so I didn't know what had been left in and left out of this account of his life since then I talked to my father who knew many things about the man as he had lived and worked in London just after hanging was abolished and had seen Pierrepoint interviewed. He told me about a few things that weren't shown in the film things that would have given my father an opinion about what type of person this famous hangman was. I've asked my father to see the film as I want to know how the celluloid depiction compares to his memories of the real man even if he believes it to be inaccurate I'll still watch it again.It is a dark sad film which wouldn't be a great date movie but maybe a film you should watch the next time you have a bad day at work.".

	schema:headline " Excellent study of a macabre outdated profession";
	schema:reviewBody "A wonderful understated movie. Very British in style and with excellent acting.Timothy Spall gives a wonderful serious performance as the thorough dedicated unquestioning professional whose value system is entirely interwoven with the mechanics of his arcane job. He never questions the rights and wrongs of his task other people have decided whether his victims live or die he merely executes their verdicts with as much dignity and professionalism as he can.There is no vengeance or remorse for his victims. He will not engage in debates or recriminations about either those whose guilt was famously in doubt or those whose crimes were breathtaking in their depravity. All deserve a speedy painless death and a decent burial.The highlight of the film is when he has to confront in the condemned cell a regular at his bar whom he knows only by nickname and does not realise his identity until he has to 'size him up' for the drop. This scene is beautifully and believably acted and is extremely convincing. The incident is very true and is portrayed almost exactly as Pierrepoint described it in his memoirs.With capital punishment now discontinued in most civilised countries we are unlikely to see the likes of Pierrepoint again. He is portrayed as a man of his time. Loyal obedient trusting of his place in society and determined to uphold the status quo as he sees it. Which includes dispatching those who rightly or wrongly fell on the wrong side of it.The moment of crisis in the film forces him to confront the fact that the line between guilt and innocents is sometimes a thin one indeed.".

He never questions the rights and wrongs of his task other people have decided whether his victims live or die he merely executes their verdicts with as much dignity and professionalism as he can.There is no vengeance or remorse for his victims. He will not engage in debates or recriminations about either those whose guilt was famously in doubt or those whose crimes were breathtaking in their depravity. All deserve a speedy painless death and a decent burial.The highlight of the film is when he has to confront in the condemned cell a regular at his bar whom he knows only by nickname and does not realise his identity until he has to 'size him up' for the drop. This scene is beautifully and believably acted and is extremely convincing. The incident is very true and is portrayed almost exactly as Pierrepoint described it in his memoirs.With capital punishment now discontinued in most civilised countries we are unlikely to see the likes of Pierrepoint again. He is portrayed as a man of his time. Loyal obedient trusting of his place in society and determined to uphold the status quo as he sees it. Which includes dispatching those who rightly or wrongly fell on the wrong side of it.The moment of crisis in the film forces him to confront the fact that the line between guilt and innocents is sometimes a thin one indeed.";

	schema:reviewBody "I sometimes wonder why mostly older films are being hailed as the best film ever made. Citizen Kane the Godfather Trilogy and so on. But why can't a fairly contemporary film be the best one ever made? I believe that a contemporary work can be just as good as the great classics  simply because the cinema industry must inevitably have evolved during the many decades since its inception. If you look at many older films that are considered to be very great you can see that the quality of the work is not good enough to really engage modern viewers. For example the TVfilm The Bunker features a miscast Anthony Hopkins as Adolf Hitler some poor acting at places unrealistic sets and shoddy craftsmanship through the entire thing. This is probably not due to any incompetence on the behalf of the film makers or the actors but rather a result of time and money issues. Yet this TV film has only a 0.1 lesser rating on IMDb than The Last Hangman. It seems to me that contemporary films that are actually not that good are often over rated because of massive budgets distribution networks and incredibly skilled marketing. One example is the film Avatar which suffers from a horrible script that simply doesn't make sense. It truly does deserve the epithet Dances With Smurfs and will probably be destined for future oblivion. According to me Avatar is the epithet of a brain dead popcorn movie that simply doesn't summon up any meaningful emotions. A good example of this is La guerre du feu of 1981  a probably horribly overbudgeted and overmarketed disaster that features some very strange and poor acting. This film has the exact same rating on IMDb as The Last Hangman. But who remembers it today? I dare you to watch this film without starting to laugh at the Neanderthal people. And I don't really think that is the effect that the director was after...In contrast The Last Hangman is a superbly directed and acted film that simply knocks out all of its competition. It features Timothy Spall who stands out as one of the greatest actors of his generation. I should warn you that this may not be an easy movie to watch. The scene where the character Pierrepoint tells his wife about hanging his friend Tish left me completely devastated. But I believe that this film is a very strong argument against the death penalty. Perhaps Pierrepoint realizes at the end that you can kill people  but you can't unkill them.".

The delightful and enchanting Juliet Stevenson is perfect as Pierrepoint's wife Annie.Like his earlier Danielle Cable Eyewitness 2003 the Granada TV director Adrian Shergold has surpassed himself in his favourite genre of crime. This offering was filmed at Ealing Studios of all places.Pierrepoint is a fruit and veg delivery man in the humble northern English streets of Rochdale normally except when he gets the call to go and hang someone usually in London or HMP Strangeways in Manchester. He is unsurpassed as a technician of death perfectly estimating the length of rope etc. depending on the height and build of the person to be executed. You could call him the L S Lowry of killers an ordinary man with a certain skill when it comes to looking at and handling other people.He begins as a sort of trainee  who would be the instructor is this line of work?  yet sees each of his peers fade once confronted with the absolute horror of their new job leaving him the consummate professional always on hand when the Home Office needs a job done. For Pierrepoint it is a vocation.Pierrepoint always takes a deep professional pride in his work seeing the condemned person as deserving of dignity and respect in death no matter what their deeds in life. This creates a strange paradox as he is forced to be clinical and brutal in helping that person to their end. However given his professional expertise that end is much quicker and more comfortable than other executioners and methods.So after 13 years in the job  merely half way through his career which saw him hang an incredible 608 people including the innocent Timothy Evans and also Ruth Ellis amongst others  Pierrepoint is called upon to be the official British hangman at the Nuremberg Tribunals in the aftermath of World War Two. This is where he has to dispatch truly monstrous and evil people extermination camp guards and the like. This is also where for me the film steps up a level.In Nuremberg Pierrepoint has to dispatch up to ten war criminals a day. It is a massive job on a scale for which he did not go prepared.The British army have constructed a scaffold above ground  unlike the usual discreet prison cell and trapdoor gallows  and the guilty are to go by the couple sidebyside. And this is all to take place in one enormous cavernous  and very apt if you excuse the pun  aircraft hanger. The British have created a vast cathedral of hanging the scaffold as its pulpit and Pierrepoint as its archbishop of retribution.Nevertheless Pierrepoint performs his dreadful task with professional brilliance at great pains to insist on the dignity of the guilty once dead he is horrified when some are expected to be disposed of without even a wooden coffin 'No that's not right' exclaims Spall the epitome of northern disdain.For me the shot of the film  the true emblematic classy shot that shows the difference between Pierrepoint and everyone else not least his assistant a military attach sitting beside him as they relax with a cigarette after yet another execution  takes place in this hanger the cathedral of execution the height of Pierrepoint's career.In a close shot Pierrepoint and his military assistant sit at either end of a table enjoying a smoke. The military man attempts a philosophical discussion of the magnitude of what they've done. Pierrepoint has no comprehension at all separated as he is from his assistant by the contents of the rest of the screen  the scaffold in the background deserted after a day's work.Pierrepoint was a lonely man yet had a typically northern showman's instinct with his friend Tish they perform a Flanagan and Allen style musical medley in the pub. Tish is his only friend in the world probably more so than his wife.The most touching scene of the film is at the end when Pierrepoint has to execute James 'Tish' Corbitt he never knew his true name until then.".

If it has made it to the film festival and it is UK produced it will be good. At least that is what I have found over the years at the festival.Now this project was originally a made for Granada TV in the UK. Not 100 sure if it has aired yet on television over in the UK. This is a very well made well acted movie. The Director and actor Timothy Spall was there for the interesting QA session. Basically the story follows the Hangman 'Pierrepoint' following in this father's foot prints over his career as Britain's 'Best executioner. How does this job affect him and even more interesting how it affects everyone around him.The most unlikely plot twist was to my amazement completely true. The filmmakers try to be as accurate as possible there was no need to make anything up the true story itself in interesting enough. The trip 'Pierrepoint' took to Germany after the war was particularly well done.The QA raised the obvious questions on the Death Penalty and the producers' feelings on that subject. There is a brief scene of 'Pierrepoint' cleaning up a 'lady' afterwords it included some full frontal nudity. A lady in the audience asked why that was shown and not a guy in the same position. In the attempt to be accurate as possible the director stated that when a woman is hanged there are biological differences that need special attention. He did not want to go into specifics which was just fine with this blogger.Great Film but the subject material is dark 'Pierrepoint' is shown at work for most of the film which will put some people off.I knew before watch the movie that it was originally made for TV. There is a lot of quality material that hits the airwaves. Watching a movie on to the Big Screen certainly adds to the experience of any movie. Now what if you watched some of the best The Sopranos episodes on the big screen? What about Six Feet Under or what ever your favorite drama program is. This is good but do you need to throw your 10 down to see it in the theater? If the idea of seeing quality TV on the big screen is appealing to you then the answer is most certainly yes.My Rating  B".

	schema:reviewBody "PIERREPOINT THE LAST HANGMAN is one of those films that emerges from the cracks in the theater 'failures' only to find its poignant message when released on DVD. Granted the idea of a story based on England's most famous executioner doesn't immediately catch the interest of the general audience but for those fortunate enough to either rent or buy this DVD the rewards are plentiful. It is a little masterpiece of writing acting directing and production values.Albert Pierrepoint was the third man in his family to 'ascend' to the list of executioners capital punishment in England at the time was by hanging and when he is accepted to the list in 1932 he begins what became the longest and most prolific career of British executioners. He took enormous pride in his work assuring his peers as well as his 'victims' that every aspect of his job was done with obsessive professionalism his timing of his duties was the shortest on record meaning that from the moment he opened the door to the condemned prisoner's room through the hooding and noose placement and tripping of the platform and subsequent death of the 'criminal' he spared suffering as much as was feasible. He was supported by a wife who kept the secret of her husband's anonymous role and it was only when the Pierrepoint's pride in his job became known that downfall of their lives is threatened. At times adored by the public for his assignment to hand the Nazi criminals and the famous murderers and eventually the target of the anti capital punishment activists Pierrepoint's professionalism sustained him until a final tragic assignment changed his view of his job.Timothy Spall is splendid as Pierrepoint capturing all of the nuances of the simple honest man's pride as well as his Achilles' heel. Juliet Stevenson turns in yet another understated and completely realized role as Pierrepoint's wife. Director Adrian Shergold using a script written by Bob Mills and Jeff Pope paces the film sensitively drawing on the atrocious duties involved in the job of executioner they actually had to prepare the bodies of the dead victims for the morticians! along with the moments of pub frivolity to allow the audience to understand the true person Timothy Spall absorbs in his portrayal of Pierrepoint. The sets and lighting and cinematography could not be better. This is a film to view and absorb and appreciate the superior quality of acting of Spall and Stevenson. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

This to some extent works to the film's advantage as it reflects Albert Pierrepoint's controlled detachment  the separation of his public and professional lives. It also allows Tim Spall  a very subtle and capable actor often wasted on comedy roles  to reveal inch by inch the hangman's gradual disenchantment with the role he served. A curious character Pierrepoint followed his father into this particular line of work and competed with other executioners to break records of swift and efficient despatch  yet insisted irrespective of the crimes committed that those sentenced to die at his hand be killed with the minimum of pain and anxiety and treated respectfully after death. Spall captures this contradictory personality excellently. The downside of this directorial restraint however is that the first half of the film drags a little and Spall's ultimate expression of confusion and regret at executing a former friend  thus making the job personal and crossing the publicprivate divide he'd set himself  jars a little. Juliet Stevenson as the hangman's wife gives good support as does Eddie Marsan as Pierrepoint's pathetic lovelorn friend Tish.Jeff Pope's script is spare but effective and a vast improvement on his work on TV's 'Northern Lights' and the atrocious 'Essex Boys' 2000".

The performance by Timothy Spall in the lead role was brilliant. Spall succeeds in portraying a very positive image of Pierrepoint a man of high personal values who adheres to a high code of conduct. The movie is based on Albert Pierrepoint's biography and conveys him as the quintessential professional who has a rather unpleasantjob to do and is hellbent on doing it to the very best of his abilities. The performances by Juliet Stevenson as Pierrepoint's supportive but troubled wife and Marsden as his pub mate Tish are also noteworthy.Throughout his more than two decades long successful careerPierrepont goes about his job with a high sense of professional detachment. He is not at all interested in knowing about or passing any judgements on the crimes of his condemned prisoners whom he is required to despatch from this world. He is just focused on their height weight and physical condition so that he can put an end to their lives in the quickest and most efficient manner a thorough professional who takes immense pride in being the undoubted No. 1 in his vocation in the entire country.But then one day something happens which shakes his soul and makes him seriously contemplates the correctness of capital punishment and his key role in its implementation.It is indeed a very dark and gloomy film with several trying moments. A film that forces the viewer to think and stays with him  her long afterwards. What I really liked was the fact that the film does not take any overt position on capital punishment but yet forces one to think. The technical quality is of a high standard with the hanging scenes very authentically depicted.Recommended watching for the thoughtful viewer with a strong stomach!".

Times change and the man changes with them when he starts to question the system and his role in it the moral weight of his actions prove inevitably too much to bear. Spall depicts this journey towards selfrealisation and a kind of collapse as impeccably as Pierrpoint himself went about his business. Given the baubles handed out for impersonation in films such as Ray and Capote it is surprising the Academy overlooked this captivating performance.Here in Japan hanging is still very much in vogue carried out under a veil of secrecy in the name of a public who are by and large ignorant and apathetic as to what role capital punishment plays in their society. Is it possible to enjoy this film without taking sides on the debate about capital punishment? I can't imagine so. Like 10 Rillington Place the film shows very clearly why capital punishment became untenable in British society and subsequently why it is unlikely ever to make a return. Pierrpoint strikes the right balance between showing a society in change and the effects of that change on one man and his family. This is an important film in social terms and a triumph in filmmaking ones.".

I don't see any flab on these gals especially when they start shaking their tushes to Elvis Presley's hip rattling songs. Adams spots Elvis singing at a country dive while waiting for rodeo season to start and soon he's created tension at the spa especially with the strictly business Jocelyn Lane who obviously has the hots for him as do the bevy of beauties who pop up to say a line here bat their eye lashes there and for the most part showing that physical beauty doesn't always mean dramatic talent. While not a great actor Presley has decent line reading but is basically playing himself. Adams however is both beautiful and talented and makes her boss lady commanding flirtatious firm both in temperament and in the physical sense as well and delightfully funny. Not just a fan of hers for her movies I found her a great scene stealer on the daytime soap Capitol where she took the focus away from the younger actors and made you notice her even when in scenes with the equally commanding Constance Towers Marj Dusay who flirted with Elvis in Clambake Ed Nelson and Richard Egan the star of Elvis's first film Love Me Tender. It's too bad she never got to work with Carolyn Jones King Creole tying Elvis in with 4 of Capitol's cast.The fact that Elvis's character supposedly knows who Jennie Lind was is a far fetched detail but that leads to a very cartoon like flashback to the past and a ridiculous story involving stolen treasure. The film concludes with a farcial sequence in a haunted house that makes the Bugs BunnyRoad Runner Show look like Shakespeare. Elvis's songs too are mediocre and he has absolutely zero chemistry with Lane so it depends on the charm of the cast which includes veteran character actress Connie Gilchrist and cult actresses Allison Hayes and Merry Anders to rise above its preposterous story.".

Elvis as a singing rodeo cowboy gets sidetracked working at a dude ranch for young women wishing to look better and hooks up with Jocelyn Lane possibly the best looking woman on the planet in 1965. The music taken from some older Elvis LPs fits fine. The songs Dirty Dirty Feeling and Slowly But Surely are great songs on their own as is the opening sequence number Long Lonely Highway which was released as a single. Such An Easy Question also released as a single in 65 is more of a romantic ballad and is quite good tho it sounded better when it was released a couple years earlier on the Pot Luck album. They added some background orchestration to the movie version that is totally out of place. Julia Adams and Wild Bill Williams head up a stellar supporting cast. A good solid Elvis movie and remember these movies were not made to compete for Oscars.".

And even though they are all on a strict diet and physical regimen it soon becomes obvious that food isn't the only thing that interests them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining musicalcomedy which incorporated several strange twists and turns along the way. Likewise having a couple of beautiful actresses like Jocelyn Lane as Pam Merritt along with the aforementioned Julie Adams certainly didn't hurt either.

As for the other aspects of the film the trouble lies with the acting and the comedy. Jocelyn Lane the luscious Austrian model is beautiful but someone should have taught her how to act.

The experienced actors in this opus do the best they can with the material they have to work with. Veterans like Grady Sutton and Merry Anders look sadly out of place. This film is a prime example of Elvis having to live with obvious garbage handed him by Col. Tom Parker and not objecting to it because he did not want to seem ungrateful for the things Parker did for his career.

Once Elvis was asked why he wasn't going into suchandsuch aspect of his career and he replied I can't man! I'm carryin' too many people! which is genuinely sad  and Tickle Me is emblematic of this. Marlyn Mason Elvis' costar in The Trouble With Girls once recounted in an interview that Elvis told her You know people in this town Hollywood think that I'm a joke. Which is dreadfully sad to think of what might have been if Elvis' career had been unfettered and free of junk like Tickle Me. Maybe he'd still be alive today.".

Presley plays a singing rodeo rider who finds himself working at a ranch where zaftig women go to peel away pounds. It's run by Adams who has her sites set on him and is also home to exercise instructor Lane who is more skeptical at least at first. Presley's roomie is dim bulb fellow hand Mullaney while his chief antagonist is jealous swim instructor Faulkner who sports one really awkwardlooking and unappetizing set of swim trunks hoisted up practically to his chest! Presley has to fend off the female guests of the ranch who are hungry not only for steak but for him while Lane searches in vain for a fortune her grandfather left behind in a nearby western ghost town. It all comes to a head in a protracted finale that seems more like a very bad episode of Scooby Doo than a piece of musical froth. Presley lopes through the film with varying degrees of interest lipsynching to songs he had recorded months and years prior a symptom of the low budget of the project not that it stands out too much to the casual viewer. It's just that the songs bear virtually no relation to anything and there's not even a title tune. The script is preposterous so Presley goes along for the ride as well as he can. Lane is almost legendary as one of The King's most attractive costars. Her body even by today's standards is unbelievable so it's hard to imagine how jawdropping she must have seemed in '65. Her acting leaves quite a bit to be desired but most male viewers will care very little! A Brit in real life she provides a creditable American accent. Adams doesn't even try to mask her character's outright lust for Presley. She isn't given much to do at all beyond drooling over him but she looks great doing it and does it with verve. Mullaney is annoying as would be expected from anyone being led through tired 3 Stooges style schtick. The films writers had worked with the comic trio previously. Most of the rest of the cast are only shown is brief bits. At times it seems like the story  to use a term loosely  was cobbled together in order to take advantage of preexisting sets left over from a prior movie and it's possible that that is what happened. Nonetheless this was an inexplicable box office smash placing the studio that backed it into the black and giving Presley who was entitled to 50 of the profits a hefty payday as well. At least it is colorful and attractive to the eye most of the time and undemanding to say the least. It's just a shame that someone as handsome and talented as Presley was unable or unwilling to be placed in projects that better displayed his charms while also paying tribute to them instead of bleeding them and his reputation dry.".

The performances particularly by Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack were spot on and the script was both witty and original in equal measure. Mark Williams as the acidly sarcastic Detective and Hugh Bonneville as the irate farmer are particular delights.

It is alternately silly mostly in the first and last 15 minutes and edgy in the middle but if you can ignore the various implausibilities why would such a wellorganized and highly professional team of robbers have such a moron as their lookout in the first place? it's fun with engaging performances particularly by Minnie Driver and Kevin McNally who does the right thing by playing his role straight. In any case it is much better than the very similar and meanspirited Beautiful Creatures from the same year.      12".

Happily High Heels and Low Lifes' directed by Mel Smith is one of those rare gems of a little justforfun movie that succeeds in being exactly what it was meant to be  Highly entertaining and most importantly fun and in a way that's not only memorable but quite accessible and one that lends itself to multiple viewings primarily because of it's stars Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack who make one of the most winsome and engaging teams to come along in quite some time. After a fight with her boyfriend nurse Shannon Driver is left to celebrate her birthday with her best friend Frances McCormack an aspiring actress.  Departing as he did in a hurry Shannon's boyfriend leaves behind his recording equipment and the scanners that enable him to pick up telephone conversations he can record and use to create a kind of urban new age music.  And after a bit too much to drink the girls start to fool around with the scanner and happen across a phone conversation between a gang of crooks committing a robbery.Driven to action by purely altruistic intentions of course the girls realize this is a chance to pick up a big chunk of change real quick and they decide to contact and negotiate' with the thieves for a part of the take.  The girls tell them to cough up or they'll go to the police.  Big mistake as they have no idea who they're dealing with or how big and bad the organization behind them really is.  But Shannon and Frances are about to find out and before it's all over they just may wish they'd never heard of a scanner' or for that matter a telephone.  Then again maybe not...Mel Smith succeeds in crafting and delivering a highenergy often hilarious romp through London and the surrounding environs as he puts his stars through their paces in a way that generates plenty of laughs and makes his audience glad they came along for the ride.  Smith sets a perfect pace that makes this a lively comedy enriched by witty dialogue wry British humor and the iridescent performances of Driver and McCormack all of which makes this film more reminiscent of such fare as Michael Caine's The Italian Job' or any of the early Peter Sellers movies rather than the more contemporary Farrelly Brothers'American Pie' type humor that is so prevalent today.  And as such it is refreshingly fun AND funny and leaves you yearning for more of the same.Since her auspicious motion picture debut as Benny in the heartwarming Circle of Friends' in 1995 Driver has successfully filled her resume with films that run the gamut from black comedy As Debi Grosse Pointe Blank' and straight drama Rosie The Governess' to action Karen Hard Rain'. Not all of her projects have been a success critically andor at the box office perhaps but one would be hardput to find a single performance of hers among them that is not engaging and credible.  She's demonstrated time and again that she can hold her own with the big boys in the high profile films alongside De Niro in Sleepers' Damon and Affleck in Good Will Hunting' and one of her most memorable performances is in what is arguably one of the best romantic comedies of all time Return To Me' in which she plays Grace.  All in all in a comparatively short time Driver has accrued some impressive credentials and she never fails to live up to her promise and her portrayal of Shannon in this film is no exception.  Using to great effect her quirky good looks and winning personality combined with a discernible intelligence that points up a beauty that is much more than skin deep here as always she is a delight to watch.Perfectly cast as well is Mary McCormack as she succeeds in capturing the very essence of Frances while proving to be a perfect complement to Driver's Shannon.  McCormack has that same kind of wellrounded beauty as Driver which indicates there's always something going on behind the eyes and cinematically speaking as a team it makes them a force to be reckoned with.  Most importantly McCormack brings Frances vividly and enthusiastically to life and it goes far toward enabling the viewer to suspend disbelief long enough to just go with the flow and enjoy the high jinks of these two young ladies as they cut their swath across the English countryside.In a terrific supporting role Michael Gambon as Kerrigan is wonderfully droll espousing that ohsowryanddry British humor in a manner reminiscent and worthy of Noel Coward at his best.  Indeed Gambon has some of the funniest lines delivered so subtly as to evoke purely spontaneous bursts of sidesplitting laughter from the audience.  And when an actor can do that he has without question succeeded in doing his job which is exactly what Gambon has accomplished here.The supporting cast includes Kevin McNally Mason Mark Williams Tremaine Danny Dyer Danny Darren Boyd Ray Simon Scardifield Tony and Len Collin Barry.  By definition a comedy is a movie or play of light and humorous character with a happy or cheerful ending.'  Therefore by definition High Heels and Low Lifes' is a comedy' in every sense of the word.  Thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable it's a film that makes a promise for a good time to be had by all then goes on to fulfill that promise.  The magic is alive and well in this one and that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is not often that I use this word in film reviews but High Heels and Low Lifes was a very cute movie. While it did follow a very formulaic caper approach there were elements that were very original and stood out in this film. It had a crisp semihumorous story coupled with two actresses that were very into their roles. There were some dark elements that I was not expecting when they were dealing with the gangsters that kept my attention until the very end. This was one of those films where you knew exactly how it was going to end but you still had fun watching your characters get there. This film was a nobrainer but in a good sense. If you are looking for a fun caper film that takes no energy to watch than this is the film for you. That is exactly what I was looking for when I watched this film and it worked perfectly. Let me tell you why.My biggest satisfaction from this film came from the very unrealistic portrayal of London's dark underbelly. It begins with a very sinister retrospect on the crime in this populated city with images of hardcore robbers doing what they do best. That is the last glimpse we have of that world because by the end of the film the darkness sheds to light and we are handed a fantasy world all our own. The bad guys go from their darkened world and into mansions full of color ambition and cartoon blunders. It is this sense of unreality that kept me focused on this film. Here we have two women that are having this 'movie' adventure while hiding in bushes wearing dark sunglasses and fighting with guys in the cow pastures yet on the other hand we have these criminals that truly want to kill them. There are huge guns fired people get shot and there are even some literal explosions. It reminded me of when Elmer Fudd was hunting for Bugs Bunny. There is some horror to the realization that Fudd only wants to 'kill the rabbit' but there is humor in the unrealistic events that occur due to Bugs' outlandish style and Fudd's ignorance. So when you look at the cover of this film do not be fooled. What I am trying to say here is that the unreal story is what kept my attention. I don't know if the writers wanted to create a real world with these heroes but in my eyes they didn't. This was a fictional story and I couldn't see this happening in real life  and that worked for me.I must say that Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack are not at the top of Hollywood players list but they seemed to carry themselves well in this picture. I think the reason that they worked was because it was a small film. Driver and McCormack do better in these small budgeted films than they do in the blockbusters. I don't think I have ever seen a bigbudget Minnie Driver film that I would say was 'amazing' and the same goes for McCormack. High Heels and Low Lifes is their type of film. Thankfully director Mel Smith knows that and knew what he had to work with. He keeps the tone low on this film making the humor not laughoutloud but grinable. There wasn't really anything spectacular about the direction of this film and that was perfect for this film. At times directors of these smaller films try to reach out and become to artsy with their craft this was not the case here. Smith stayed on the path of this film and worked his magic with the greatest of ease. He was not trying to go over the top but yet successfully kept this film from sinking.Overall this was a 'cute' film. I will use that word again because I cannot think of a better way to describe this simple film. It was easy on the eyes and on the mind and if you are in the mood for that style of film than High Heel and Low Lifes will provide it. Minnie Driver and Mary McCormack play off each other exceptionally well while Mel Smith eases behind the camera. There is nothing spectacular about this film. I probably will never see it again but it was worth watching once. It is always good to have these types of films around. Those that do not try to go overboard yet give you exactly what you went in looking for. I was impressed.Grade  out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "With her arty and selfish boyfriend busy recording digital signals in order to make an audio installation Shannon goes out for a drunken night with her friend Frances. Coming home later that night they are messing around with the sound recording equipment when they pick up what they believe to be a bank robbery in progress. Trying to report it to a police station snowed under with muggers pushers and drunken yobs achieves nothing and the next day they hear on the news that the robbery has taken place. With the telephone number of one of the gang still written on her hand from the recording equipment Frances comes up with the idea of blackmailing the robbers for a cut of the cash. Unfortunately for her she forgets that the gang are criminals and soon the stakes are much higher than Shannon or Frances bargained for.Everything about this film put me off it  the fact that it was a UK comedy Mel Smith the cast of British TV comedians and the poor reviews but anyway I decided to give it a go when it came on television recently. From the very start the plot lacked any sort of credibility relying on some very forced points to start the story and to keep it moving throughout. At times this is annoying but for most of the film the rough energy of the film just about covers just how very silly it is. The film is meant to be a comedy but it rarely made me laugh but it did have just enough rough humour to it to make it reasonably enjoyable as a sort of brainless piece of entertainment. Of course it is not a great film but the undemanding viewer will at least find it is easy to watch.The cast are a mixed bunch some of them make the film better but generally the majority are given little to actually do. Driver and McCormack are enjoyable and fun to watch and they make good on what could have been stupid roles. They play it larger than life and although never funny are a big part of the film being at least a bit of fun. The support cast throws up a lot of wellknown faces from both acting and comedy but none of them really make a mark other than showing their face. Dyer Gambon and McNally just show up and do their best but comedians such as Sessions Williams Eldon and Simpson don't really have any material to show what they can do. Director Smith makes a cameo and as director he does an OK job without really ever doing anything unique I suppose he at least makes it look more professional that some British comedies have  shame he couldn't find the laughs.Overall this is a poor comedy if you are looking for consistent laughs but it has got just enough rough energy to keep it moving and it never made me feel like the laughs were missing so much as just not there if you see the difference. Of course it is basic and simple but I was sort of in the mood for that and meeting it on these terms it made for passable entertainment but I'll forget it soon enough!".

As it happens that I like both Minnie and UK I really appreciated it. The basic idea of turning girlish friends into blackmailers for the good cause is really intelligent and original. With Minnie and her friend they found a great duo. Their characterization is very accurate because their plan sounds realistic and they are great standing up when things falls apart. Along them you can find an excellent dark crook and some future Harry Potter wannabees Mr Weasley and Dumbledore himself!. All the action is shot live in London and you can get some good slices of it from the luxury mansion to modern flats to train station from hospital parks and aerial shoots.".

As it happens that I like both Minnie and UK I really appreciated it. The basic idea of turning girlish friends into blackmailers for the good cause is really intelligent and original. With Minnie and her friend they found a great duo. Their characterization is very accurate because their plan sounds realistic and they are great standing up when things falls apart. Along them you can find an excellent dark crook and some future Harry Potter wannabees Mr Weasley and Dumbledore himself!. All the action is shot live in London and you can get some good slices of it from the luxury mansion to modern flats to train station from hospital parks and aerial shoots.";

Minnie Driver looked very pretty in this movie and seeing her in this role is natural. Mary McCormack is very good too seeing her do English accents was good. even though the two lead roles are females i do not think this would be classified as a chickflick there is plenty of laughs and a good plotto keep you in the story. the supporting cast was also wonderful their acting was not complicated but yet they as actors did enough to make their characters come to life. i only wish i could of written this review earlier. because maybe there would have been an even better sequel.".

Unexpected touches of humor excellent character actors good plot. Oh just watch it and enjoy yourself. I guarantee you will be quoting some of the better lines afterward.How many movies give you a rabbit who is apparently immune to machine gun fire aside from Bugs Bunny?Where else can you see Minnie Driver blasting a machine gun and laughing madly?And if you loved Mary McCormack in The West Wing... watch her suffer with a hangover while doing voiceovers for an animated alien tomato... we've all been there right?".

	schema:reviewBody "Takes place in England. Shannon Minnie Driver is a nurse who evicts her boyfriend because he pays her no attention even on her birthday. He is instead infatuated with electronic eavesdropping on other people's wireless conversations from which he collects snippets for some kind of artistic project he has in mind. Frances Mary McCormack Shannon's best friend is a struggling actor with a talent for changing her voice and accent. One of my favorite scene has Frances repeating a line for a cartoon using different voices and styles at the behest of the director. Fooling around with audio equipment of Shannon's boyfriend after getting drunk they hear burglars in the act of robbing a bank on Shannon's street. They know it is on Shannon's street because they her a police car out there window at the same time they her the burglars discussing it. They go to the police while the robbery is in progress but the harried officer on the desk treats them as a couple of nuts. The next day when they hear newscast reports of the burglary rather than going to the police again they decide to blackmail the crooks based on names and a phone number they overheard for a portion of the loot. The crooks turn out to be part of a sophisticated gang. The story continues with the girls clumsily trying to get a money drop from the burglars and the burglars trying to find and eliminate whoever has been contacting them about the burglary. Minnie Driver looks very cute the acting is fine and the film is fun to watch. However the plot has major problems that require the girls to do things that are stupider then the girls appear to be such as not going to the police again once they learn how dangerous the bad guys are. At one time the crooks are in a gun battle with the girls who are using an arsenal of fully automatic weapons they stole from the crooks. The girls have the bad guys totally out gunned but Shannon insists that Frances give her a chance to use an assault rifle which she has never used and turns out can't control. That childish behavior is not consistent with her character. SPOILER  The film never explains how Frances was not shot when Shannon repeatedly shoots her with one of the bad guy's weapon. Nor does it explain how Shannon who is acting dead in the same room as the other players somehow steals a large arsenal from the crook's weapons storage and gets outside behind a hedge before the others exit. It also isn't explicit about what happens to Kerrigan the Don of the gang at the end. It also doesn't explain why the police stop looking for the two attractive girls who reported the crime while it was in progress.  SPOILERI would have rated it higher if not for all those goofs because I did find it enjoyable.".
