Levine picked up the options on both of these films and waged a massive advertising campaign in newspapers and television and those two Hercules films became monster hits at the box office. Not to learn from their previous mistakes Reeves then made a muscleman epic called Goliath and the Barbarians.....independent American International picked up the option on the film and it made a monster amount of money for them. Go figure out Hollywood....In Goliath and the Barbarians Reeves is the leader of a band of Italian villagers hell bent on revenge against a massive horde of barbarian huns led by a maniac named Igor. After a massacre of his village including the murder of his father Reeves decides enough is enough. He secretly starts to wipe out the barbarian horde one by one until his methods are found out by Igor. Along the way the beautiful Chelo Alonso a barbarian queen becomes his love interest. Talk about a beauty.....she is a dancer and a romancer. Reeves tries not to get too involved with her but that is a lost cause. Check out the scene with Reeves in a test of strength pulls two horses with his hands tied to a pair of ropes....then he pulls down a slew of barbarians trying to pull him into a sword pit on a wall.....great stuff for the kids and the Saturday afternoon matine crowd. Reeves ripling bulging muscles are shown to the max in those scenes. By the end of the film Reeves and his men wipe out the barbarians including their leader and all is well. Final scene shows Reeves riding off into the sunset with Alonso sitting on his saddle.....at that time Reeves was the king of the muscleman movies with three blockbusters to his credit. All the muscleman actors that followed were no match for the physique and looks of Mr. Reeves. He certainly was the king of the Italian muscleman flicks.".

Nicely paced and well shot I finally saw this on DVD and its one of Reeves' best efforts. It makes one wonder what he could have done with a real director and a solid cast. The music is better than average too. The barbarians are shown raping and pillaging but they're not cardboard cutouts here and some are given real personality i.e. Landa's father Delfo and Igor's sometimes ally well played by Arturo Dominici.

	schema:headline " Sword and Sandals film centers upon the usual hero combating enemies  King Alboino and his Lombards hoodlums";
	schema:reviewBody "This Muscle man movie contains adventures  thrills  a love story and hokey historic events . Being a soso Italian production financedwritten by Emimmo Salvi and professionally directed by Carlo Campogalliani . Colorful swordandsandal odyssey  wellplotted with an appealing performance from Steve Reeves  dealing with the time of King Alboino and his Longobards in which Barbarian armies sweep the Ancient Roman empire . When Barbarians invade his village and kill his father  a local man wages an oneman war against them . Then  there appears a corpulent mysterious masked man . He will kill 10000 Barbarians . And all of them will call him GOLIATH! . As Goliath and his men go after the Barbarians who are ravaging and terrorizing the Northern Italian countryside  attacking Verona and Milan  during the Fall of the Roman Empire . Goliath must fight Barbarians to save enemy princess lovely Chelo Alonso and he conquers all . The picture is partially based on historical events  here shows up the powerful Alboino American secondary Bruce Cabot . After gathering a large coalition of peoples Alboin crossed the Julian Alps in 568 entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly took control of most of Venetia and Liguria. In 569 unopposed he took northern Italy's main city Milan. Pavia offered stiff resistance however and was only taken after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin turned his attention to Tuscany but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves. Alboin was assassinated on June 28 572 in a coup d'tat instigated by the Byzantines. It was organized by the king's foster brother Helmichis with the support of Alboin's wife Rosamund daughter of the Gepid king whom Alboin had killed some years earlier . This is an entertaining Peplum movie  full of action  thrills  doublecrosses and of course  a lot of battles and fights . Another sword and sandal flick  this is acceptable . The production values are better than average and the acting and direction at least try  including noisy action  spectacular combats  court intrigue  and usual dances performed by the gorgeous dancer Chelo Alonso . Screenwritten by Emimmo Salvi who wrote and produced lots of Peplum  Giallo and Spaghetti Western . Lots of intrigue  treason  evocative scenarios  twists  thrills and ordinary spectacle as bouncing man carried out by the great Steve Reeves . Well sculped Steve plays yet another mesophorn to the rescue in this poorly dubbed Spaghetti legend . Sympathetic performances by main star cast such as Steve Reeves in one his main films of his fruitful career  beauty Chelo Alonso and agreeable secondary cast  as the marvelous main actors are completed by a stellar cast full of veteran Italian players as Arturo Dominici  Gino Scotti  Livio Lorenzon  Andrea Checchi  Carla Cal and special appearance by Bruce Cabot  John Ford's regular secondary . The picture is well starred by the hunk man Steve Reeves as the notorious wartime hero against Lombards captained by Igor  Livio Lorenzon and Delfo  Andrea Checchi  all of them governed by King Alboino  Bruce Cabot . In 1957 Reeves went to Italy and played the lead character in Pietro Francisci's Hercules a very lowbudget epic based loosely on the tales of Jason and the Argonauts though inserting Hercules into the lead role . Steve performed the mythic Maciste in a number of movies was randomly assigned the identity of Goliath  Hercules or Samson for US viewing . From 1959 through 1964 Reeves went on to appear in a string of sword and sandal movies shot on relatively small budgets  and although he is best known for his portrayal of the Greek hero Hercules he played the character only twice in the 1957 film and its 1959 sequel Hercules Unchained released in the US in 1960 . He played a number of other characters on screen including Sir Edward BulwerLytton's Glaucus of Pompeii  Goliath  Tatar hero Hadji Murad Romulus the legendary founder of Rome opposite Gordon Scott as his twin brother Remus pirate and selfproclaimed governor of Jamaica Captain Henry Morgan and Karim the Thief of Baghdad . Twice he played Aeneas of Troy and twice he played Emilio Salgari's Malaysian hero Sandokan . Steve Reeves played the Umberto Lenzi Sandokan saga  the first was Sandokan La Tigre di Mompracen or Sandokan the Great 1963 and second was Pirati Della Malesia 1964 .This film is colorfully photographed by Bitto Albertini who bit later on launched his career as a professional filmmaker . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Carlo Innocenci and compellingly conducted by Franco Ferrara . The picture was decently directed by Carlo Campogalliani 18851974  a veteran and good craftsman director . He worked in silent cinema  shooting early Peplum as Il Testamento Di Maciste 1920  Il Viaggio Di Maciste 1920  Maciste Contro la Morte 1920  Il Teschio D'Oro 1920  La trilogy Di Maciste 1919 and Maciste I . In the sixties Carlo directed four Sword and Sandals movies  Ursus 1961  Maciste Nella Valle Dei Re 1960  this Goliath and the Barbarians 1959 and Rosmunda e Alboino 1961  the latter dealing with Alboino Jack Palance  the Lombard ruler wants to marry the daughter of a neighboring king but she loves another . This barbarous war lord has his eyes set on princess Rosmunda Eleonora Rossi Drago and her father agrees to a marriage of convenience  subsequently to take place Alboino's killing .".

	onyx:emotionText "This Muscle man movie contains adventures  thrills  a love story and hokey historic events . Being a soso Italian production financedwritten by Emimmo Salvi and professionally directed by Carlo Campogalliani . Colorful swordandsandal odyssey  wellplotted with an appealing performance from Steve Reeves  dealing with the time of King Alboino and his Longobards in which Barbarian armies sweep the Ancient Roman empire . When Barbarians invade his village and kill his father  a local man wages an oneman war against them . Then  there appears a corpulent mysterious masked man . He will kill 10000 Barbarians . And all of them will call him GOLIATH! . As Goliath and his men go after the Barbarians who are ravaging and terrorizing the Northern Italian countryside  attacking Verona and Milan  during the Fall of the Roman Empire . Goliath must fight Barbarians to save enemy princess lovely Chelo Alonso and he conquers all . The picture is partially based on historical events  here shows up the powerful Alboino American secondary Bruce Cabot . After gathering a large coalition of peoples Alboin crossed the Julian Alps in 568 entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly took control of most of Venetia and Liguria. In 569 unopposed he took northern Italy's main city Milan. Pavia offered stiff resistance however and was only taken after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin turned his attention to Tuscany but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves. Alboin was assassinated on June 28 572 in a coup d'tat instigated by the Byzantines. It was organized by the king's foster brother Helmichis with the support of Alboin's wife Rosamund daughter of the Gepid king whom Alboin had killed some years earlier . This is an entertaining Peplum movie  full of action  thrills  doublecrosses and of course  a lot of battles and fights . Another sword and sandal flick  this is acceptable . The production values are better than average and the acting and direction at least try  including noisy action  spectacular combats  court intrigue  and usual dances performed by the gorgeous dancer Chelo Alonso . Screenwritten by Emimmo Salvi who wrote and produced lots of Peplum  Giallo and Spaghetti Western . Lots of intrigue  treason  evocative scenarios  twists  thrills and ordinary spectacle as bouncing man carried out by the great Steve Reeves . Well sculped Steve plays yet another mesophorn to the rescue in this poorly dubbed Spaghetti legend . Sympathetic performances by main star cast such as Steve Reeves in one his main films of his fruitful career  beauty Chelo Alonso and agreeable secondary cast  as the marvelous main actors are completed by a stellar cast full of veteran Italian players as Arturo Dominici  Gino Scotti  Livio Lorenzon  Andrea Checchi  Carla Cal and special appearance by Bruce Cabot  John Ford's regular secondary . The picture is well starred by the hunk man Steve Reeves as the notorious wartime hero against Lombards captained by Igor  Livio Lorenzon and Delfo  Andrea Checchi  all of them governed by King Alboino  Bruce Cabot . In 1957 Reeves went to Italy and played the lead character in Pietro Francisci's Hercules a very lowbudget epic based loosely on the tales of Jason and the Argonauts though inserting Hercules into the lead role . Steve performed the mythic Maciste in a number of movies was randomly assigned the identity of Goliath  Hercules or Samson for US viewing . From 1959 through 1964 Reeves went on to appear in a string of sword and sandal movies shot on relatively small budgets  and although he is best known for his portrayal of the Greek hero Hercules he played the character only twice in the 1957 film and its 1959 sequel Hercules Unchained released in the US in 1960 . He played a number of other characters on screen including Sir Edward BulwerLytton's Glaucus of Pompeii  Goliath  Tatar hero Hadji Murad Romulus the legendary founder of Rome opposite Gordon Scott as his twin brother Remus pirate and selfproclaimed governor of Jamaica Captain Henry Morgan and Karim the Thief of Baghdad . Twice he played Aeneas of Troy and twice he played Emilio Salgari's Malaysian hero Sandokan . Steve Reeves played the Umberto Lenzi Sandokan saga  the first was Sandokan La Tigre di Mompracen or Sandokan the Great 1963 and second was Pirati Della Malesia 1964 .This film is colorfully photographed by Bitto Albertini who bit later on launched his career as a professional filmmaker . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Carlo Innocenci and compellingly conducted by Franco Ferrara . The picture was decently directed by Carlo Campogalliani 18851974  a veteran and good craftsman director . He worked in silent cinema  shooting early Peplum as Il Testamento Di Maciste 1920  Il Viaggio Di Maciste 1920  Maciste Contro la Morte 1920  Il Teschio D'Oro 1920  La trilogy Di Maciste 1919 and Maciste I . In the sixties Carlo directed four Sword and Sandals movies  Ursus 1961  Maciste Nella Valle Dei Re 1960  this Goliath and the Barbarians 1959 and Rosmunda e Alboino 1961  the latter dealing with Alboino Jack Palance  the Lombard ruler wants to marry the daughter of a neighboring king but she loves another . This barbarous war lord has his eyes set on princess Rosmunda Eleonora Rossi Drago and her father agrees to a marriage of convenience  subsequently to take place Alboino's killing .";

	schema:reviewBody "Though best known for playing Hercules Steve Reeves only played that character twice and spent most of the rest of his Italian film career playing similarly situated mythological or legendary heroes. Goliath and the Barbarians originally titled Il terrore dei barbari has him in the Englishlanguage version anyway playing Goliath the nom de guerre of Emiliano a woodcutter whose Italian village is over run by the multicultural barbarian hordes in the oddly specific year 568 A.D. Conveniently ignoring that Italy had been the seat of the most powerful empire in the West and had done plenty of conquering and pillaging of its own this film portrays the Italians as saltoftheEarth hardworking peasants beset by the evil foreigners. You know they're evil because 1 they are boorish 2 they spend a lot of time in revelries and generally seem to be having much more fun than the Italians 3 one of them is named Igor a terrific Livio Lorenzon and sports a vaguely Mongolian hairstyle and 4 they spend as much time plotting against each other as they do conquering and pillaging. Basically they're rude and not very disciplined  straight up signs of bad guys.Among the least disciplined is Chelo Alonso as the barbarian chief's headstrong daughter Landa who naturally falls for our hero as soon as she lays eyes on his big biceps. Alonso is usually one of the star attractions of Peplum cinema and she doesn't disappoint here having not one but two exotic dance numbers the second especially energetic and involving fire and a parade of fabulous costumes. She brings a manic energy to her role and to the film and helps carry Reeves who is more subdued here that he was in Hercules Unchained. He has almost as much chemistry with Alonso as he did with Sylvia Lopez in that film. Also appearing is former Hollywood boy starlet Bruce Cabot who never quite managed to become an Alist star despite rescuing Fay Wray from the original King Kong but had a long career as a supporting player.The plot gets fairly convoluted what with infighting and double crossing among the rival factions of barbarians plus the Romeoand Juliet nature of the romance between Emiliano and Landa being from opposing sides and all but it mostly holds together. It tries hard to sell a particularly nonsensical bit where a captured Emiliano whom the barbarians strongly suspect is this Goliath guy who has given them so much trouble is given two tests of strength called by Landa Tests of Truth. The fact that he is strong enough to pass them is supposed to mean he's telling the truth when he says he isn't Goliath but the fact that he passes them is also a pretty clear indication that he is the heroic strongman. It's a conundrum the film doesn't quite manage to solve but it's fun watching it try and those scenes are the best opportunities in the movie to show off Reeves's impressive physique. Alonso is very impressed! The only major Peplum trope omitted is a battle with some kind of mythological or wild creature but since Emiliano dresses in costume as Goliath to scare the barbarians I guess he is supposed to substitute for an actual monster.This is a crisply directed wellpaced film that provides plenty of battles and plundering and an allaround good time if you're inclined to like this genre.".

It's not that this is a bad film for it's well made and lavishlooking in places but the depressingly familiar plot contains few interesting characters and even less story. The pacing seems slow and is hampered by a subplot involving the romance between Reeves and Lidia the daughter of a barbarian general. GOLIATH AND THE BARBARIANS is worth watching for Steve Reeves fans or for those just starting out in the genre but to peplum fans it just looks the same as a hundred others and offers nothing new.Steve Reeves stars at the peak of his physical perfection enjoying every moment of his on screen attention as the camera gazes at his bulging biceps and rippling muscles. The best scenes in the film come when Reeves is forced to take part in two impossible tasks  the first is a deadly tugowar game the second the muchremembered horse pulling incident in which two wild horses are tied to Reeves' arms and then whipped to go in opposite directions threatening to pop his limbs from his very sockets. With every muscle straining Reeves finally manages to reign in the wild beasts and win both the approval of the crowd and his freedom.The supporting cast are an unmemorable bunch even for Italian movies with nary a sympathetic character in sight. They're just plain boring and its difficult to care about their fate. Giulia Rubini is not the prettiest of Italian leading ladies but her feisty character is worthwhile. Chief menace comes from Livio Lorenzon who plays the imposing Igor a baldheaded brute who goes around brutalising and raping those in his path. The satisfying conclusion watches as his body is repeatedly broken by Reeves in his quest for revenge.There aren't many battle sequences in the film aside from the finale which unforgivably takes place in the dark thus lessening the impact. Scenes of a disguised Reeves dressed in animal furs and known as the Goliath so that's where the name came from as he goes around slaughtering his foe are undoubtedly enjoyable though. The depiction of the barbarians massacring their enemy is a strong one and often brutally violent as their victims are repeatedly speared or stabbed to death by the enemy. Despite having good production values and a strong leading man GOLIATH AND THE BARBARIANS is finally just a routine escapade in which a drop of imagination could have worked wonders.".

	schema:reviewBody "Part fictional and part nonfictional this lavish twohour Francis Ford Coppola film spotlights the Cotton Club the legendary reallife Harlem jazz nightclub that flourished in the Prohibition era of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Richard Gere plays Dixie Dwyer a young musician who works for mobsters in an effort to advance his career. Dwyer falls in love with Vera Cicero Diane Lane the girlfriend of gangster Dutch Schultz James Remar. The Dwyer character is based loosely on reallife jazz trumpet player Bix Beiderbecke.Throughout the film various gangsters and bootleggers interact sometimes violently but much of the action centers around the Cotton Club an establishment owned in reallife by Owney Madden played in the film by actor Bob Hoskins. Madden would bring in Black performers to entertain a Whitesonly clientle a truly racist policy and a major plot point in the film's story.The film's plot is somewhat muddled the result of a less than stellar screenplay. And as you would expect the gangster characters are not terribly likable. But the film overcomes these script weaknesses with a captivating visual and musical style that is both tawdry and elegant. The corruption the violence and the implied sleaze are garish and tawdry to be sure. Yet the Club's ambiance gushes with a certain elegance and glamour. It's a strange mix but one that is entirely consistent with that era in U.S. history.The film gets points from me for its lush period piece costumes and production design and adroit lighting as well as all those jazz numbers both sultry and flashy. Gregory Hines together with brother Maurice Hines provide some snappy tap dancing some of which is improvised. Interestingly their grandmother really did perform at the Cotton Club during its heyday. Also of interest in the film viewers get to watch towering Fred Gwynne who plays Frenchy the ohsoserious assistant to Owney Madden the two of them engage in some interesting dialogue.Although the script's story and characters are less than ideal I enjoyed the film a lot mostly as a result of the tawdry and elegant visual style combined with the lavish jazz numbers. If you're interested in gangster movies or the Prohibition era of American history this film is a mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "One gets the sense that 'The Cotton Club 1984' will improve upon repeat viewings once you've become accustomed to what director Francis Ford Coppola was attempting. After all this is a gangster film from the man who brought us 'The Godfather 1972' and its sequels  what else could we expect but another Corleone saga? The film we're delivered is nothing of the sort a testament to the director's constant willingness to take risks and experiment with new ideas. Indeed rather than trying to emulate Coppola's former successes 'The Cotton Club' could more accurately be described as a gangster musical a realisation that took me until the film's second half. Do those two genres even go together? Perhaps taking inspiration from Herbert Ross' 'Pennies from Heaven 1981'  and the miniseries on which it was based  the film blends the ugly brutality and corruption of the Prohibition era with the dazzling bright lights of the Cotton Club Harlem's premiere night club. It is this deliberate but uneasy juxtaposition of reality and fantasy that fuels Coppola's vision an ambitious undertaking without a dominant focus.The film's major storyline concerns Dixie Dwyer Richard Gere a comparatively ordinary jazz musician who unexpectedly finds himself associating with organised crime boss Dutch Schultz James Remar. Dixie is interesting because unlike your typical hero consumed by the allure of amoral riches he always remains peripheral to the world of gangsters he observes with disapproval its dishonesty and depravity but rarely finds himself a part of it. In fact the closest he ever comes to being a gangster is in Hollywood where he shares the sort of film roles that made James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson famous. Coppola might have been offering a commentary on the inherently romanticised version of reality offered by the movies but his real world of gangsters is scarcely less stylised. The seedy underbelly of organised crime is paradoxically depicted as taking place in the classiest locales in Harlem where the crime bosses consume the best alcohol and mix with Hollywood's elite talent Chaplin Swanson and Cagney among the featured patrons. Proving further that Coppola wasn't attempting to replicate his Corleone saga 'The Cotton Club' also features a rather extraneous subplot with Maurice and Gregory Hines as AfricanAmerican tapdancers vying for the bigtime at the Cotton Club where in a bizarre discriminatory switch only black performers are hired. The regular crosscutting between this story and Dixie Dwyer's doesn't quite work and in any case the taut romance between Dwyer and toughgirl Vera an absolutely gorgeous Diane Lane is much more involving than that between Sandman Williams Gregory Hines and mixedrace dancer Lila Lonette McKee. Among the film's impressive supporting performers are Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne as crime associates Nicholas Cage as an overlyambitious young thug Laurence Fishburne as black crime boss Bumpy Rhodes and James Remar playing a sleazier and less identifiable version of Dutch Schultz to Dustin Hoffman in 'Billy Bathgate 1991.' The premiere gangster film of 1984 was Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America 1984' but despite being runnerup nobody can accuse Coppola of playing it safe.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie when it first came out and I thought it was a mess. Now years later while I have the luxury of sitting in my house watching the various showings on cable I like a better. Why because this movie is IMO 3 different movies going on at once. I Now I am able to concentrate on one aspect of the movie more then the whole. I will start with movie 1... The Cotton club the nightclub where everything converges and what is the common denominator that brings ALL of the characters together. It is almost set up like a Plantation in Mississippi. The white gangster own the place and the black people work there and have no say about anything that goes on. Black people were not even able to go to the club as a customer. All of the women who worked there were light skin almost passing for white. In the movie they do show how the set up was but the place was no as large as it was in the movie and on a side bar. Larry Fishburn who plays a numbers runner the same role he played in a later movie Hoodlum shows interest in a brown skin singer performer in the club and her mother is very upset because she is the first dark skin woman working at the club. I liked that they added that in. I know this because my neighbor use to play with Louis Armstrong that the women in question is in fact Louis Amstrongs future wife. A little tidbit. I like the music and the performances which took place in the club. To me this was the most enjoying part of the movie. I feel a movie just about the Club without all the other foolishness it would be very interesting in the right hands. Which brings me to movie 2THe gangsters or the white people. Owey Madden was a thug and a very nasty man. In this movie Bob Hoskin who was very good and Fred Gwynn who I loved played like they were Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble. In the right hands we would of seen the real Madden. Remember this is the man who kept black people out of his club. And did battle with other NY gangsters. Then we have Dutch Schultz. I wonder why we did not see more of Lucky Luciano because it was those 2 who were causing havoc in NYC during the 20's with Luciano winning. I think James Remer did the best portrayal of Schulz. Years later Tim Roth played him in the movie Hoodlum and he was good but Remer was scarier. And according to all reports he was a psychopath. Then we have the George RaftDixie Dwyer character played by Richard Gere If people are not familiar with the actor George Raft it was known he hung around the mob and had big time mob connections..who actually got him a job in movies. Richard Gere even mentions at one time that he use to be a dancer. I am sure that is reference and acknowledgment of George Raft who was a dancer before he went to Hollywood. George Raft was actually a pretty good actor. Gere even looks like him. I feel that is the real reason they cast him in this movie. Look at this movie as Gere playing Raft and not playing Dixie Dwyer and the part works. The last movie is the Harlem story. The Larry Fishburne character was a real person. He was lifetime criminal who spent most of his life in jail. He was not the voice of righteousness we see in the movie or the movie Hoodlum. What was interesting was the scene when he and the woman who was running the numbers racket in Harlem were offered a deal. I like they put that in the movie that was true. The woman who was the real boss of the numbers racket came from the West Indies and started the whole thing on her own. A very tough cookie who went to jail because she would not give in to the mob. The mob was politically connected and they put her in jail for a long time. I like the the Hines bothers in the movie. They were feuding in real life and this movie was a way they starting talking again. They actually showed that in the movie. ALso the Vonnetta McGee character was interesting. I am a very light skin black women who could pas for white. WhICH I WOULD NEVER DO. But I don't know about living back in the early part of the century. The scene when she and Sandman goes to the hotel and the clerk tries to deny them a room actually happened to me and a boyfriend of mine years ago. So that scene really hit me. I would of liked if they explored Harlem life more but the movie had too much going on already.Nicholas Cage...nephew of Cappolla was good playing the violent brother of the Richard Gere character. I would like to have seen him in more parts like that instead of the garbage he has been wasting himself in the last few years. Diane Lane was the miscast. She was playing a real character too but she came nowhere near the woman she was playing Texas GuinonI think that was her last name A big boozy tough blonde. To me that is the major miscast of the movie. I like her though but not in this movie. This is a movie I feel has to be seen around 5 times to get the whole feeling of it. A good movie but just too messy and too much.".

Now years later while I have the luxury of sitting in my house watching the various showings on cable I like a better. Why because this movie is IMO 3 different movies going on at once. I Now I am able to concentrate on one aspect of the movie more then the whole. I will start with movie 1... The Cotton club the nightclub where everything converges and what is the common denominator that brings ALL of the characters together. It is almost set up like a Plantation in Mississippi. The white gangster own the place and the black people work there and have no say about anything that goes on. Black people were not even able to go to the club as a customer. All of the women who worked there were light skin almost passing for white. In the movie they do show how the set up was but the place was no as large as it was in the movie and on a side bar.

Raised too high by initial expectations then dismissed too brusquely when the critics got to see it The Cotton Club exists in a kind of neutral zone a grand spectacle undone by sloppy scriptwriting and unappealing characters that nevertheless shows the master with some juice still in his cup.It's the story of Dixie Dwyer Richard Gere a cornet player who one evening in 1928 almost accidentally saves the life of notorious mob boss Dutch Schultz James Remar. Dutch already a fan of his music is appreciative of the extra service and brings Dwyer into his circle which brings him into contact with Dutch's girl Vera Diane Lane.If I didn't like you you'd be dead is Dutch's way of expressing friendship.It's nice to be liked Dixie replies.The film is centered around the nightclub of the title a fashionable Harlem nightspot where blacks are welcome only on stage entertaining the white customers. Owney Madden Bob Hoskins runs things with an eye for keeping order especially where the volatile Dutchman is concerned. Sandman Williams Gregory Hines just wants to dance into the arms of Lila Rose Lonette McKee who is torn between the chance for true love versus the chance to pass for white in a white man's world.The stacked cast even includes Nicolas Cage as Dixie's maddog gangster brother and Laurence Fishburne in one of his first signature toughguy roles. The white man has left me nothing but the underworld and that is where I dance he tells Sandman. Where do you dance? All this crammed into just over two hours leaves very little room to breathe for a director who mastered movies which do exactly that. But with little useful dialogue except of the expository kind characters coming and going all the time leftfield plot twists Dixie goes to Hollywood and becomes an instant star and a central romance between Gere and Lane that is long on openmouth kissing but short on story you need spectacle to keep your attention.Remar makes the film worthwhile for me. His bugeyed tantrums as Dutch are what stay with me when the film is over yet he shows range too shy with Vera henpecked with his wife and amiable with Dixie in his guarded way. It's hard not to worry what will happen when he learns about Dixie and Vera not only for the lovebirds but for Dutch too. I only wish Remar could have played Dutch in the latter film set in the same milieu Billy Bathgate Dustin Hoffman is a great actor but was wrong for that part. Remar here fits into it like a cement overshoe.The film also boasts great music including singing from McKee and tapping from Hines and his brother Maurice that raise the roof and recall the famous baptism scene in Coppola's first Godfather. Larry Marshall does a great Cab Calloway conked locks whipping across his forehead.Nothing is really wrong with Cotton Club. But what's right doesn't stay right for long and the rest doesn't hold together. It's a fun show so long as you don't mind being a bit confused when the curtain comes down.".

Desptie it being overbudget and underwhelming at the boxoffice what remains is probably one of the director's most provocative turns with so much thrust into it that one ends up admiring the whole so much that it can be forgiven that it veers into the bulky side of things. It's nearclassic pulp melodrama fused with the grace and intelligence of the Hollywood musicals and crime pictures of the period that would come shortly after the events in this film. It's also at times utterly pleasurable as conventional fare that knows what it is as well as visually flourishing in cinematography and editing to go a little further with the material. It's risky stuff not because of the story in and of itself but because of the chances Coppola takes with putting so much together. Unlike one of his contemporaries Scorsese and his film New York New York the Cotton Club even in its most dragging or trickiest points in the narrative reigns high as an original hybrid by giving something captivating on every side of the coin.Actingwise Coppola goes for the big ensemble once again a trademark of his films in the 80s with the key ones allowing for the director to put a lot into each smaller group. The stars as the drenchedinformula good looking' musiciancumactor Richard Gere and the girl on the side for one of the big mob bosses in New York City Diane Lane. the gangsters all with specific characteristics that gain momentum as the story goes like Dutch Schultz James Remar as the possessive paranoid killer Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne what a combo as certain 'business interests' entwined with the rest of the mob and Nicolas Cage as Gere's younger brother a hothead racist who wants to take over the black actors singers dancers all right out of Harlem and with its own stars Gregory Hines in one of his very best performancesroles and criminals Fishburne as a key part of this group. And the club itself is something of a character as principle location unto itself as some surreal bastion of escapist glee if your part of the audience and gangland violence and bad race vibes if not. Coppola also has the occasional side character like the MC at the club played by Tom Waits made believable all by a cigar to not make either side too topheavy.Whether one side bests the other or not is arguable. It's hard to say that there aren't some noteworthy scenes in practically every turn even if they tend to go overthetop like Remar with Schultz or almost too much on young charisma Lane and sometimes Gere. It's a credit to Coppola at least on that front that he corrals moments like the breakupreuniting with Sandman and Clay Williams or between the two main stars when they're literally between white sheets backstage at the club that add up to a lot in the grand scheme of things. His other main concerns however are music and the subtle presence of the camera. There's rarely a dull moment with the former as Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway are presented if only for fans as legends unto themselves that even get fleeting glances on screen the Calloway number Minnie the Moocher is a hightlight. And Coppola's tiein with Stephen Goldblatt and his editors is crucial albeit using each to their fullest extent depending on the mood. The film moves pretty fast narratively quicker than the Godfather films but he only uses montage for pivotal crosscutting moments showing the rise and fall of the gangsters with that of the club gaining prestige the fall in the big climax is as magnificent as it can get in cinema and the technical prowess is skillful and inventive.And all the same it shouldn't all work entirely because so much feels like it's about to explode at any moment and nearly to a point where it edges on the point of being the same thing that Coppola is striving to homage shallow escapist sensationalism. There's parallels between the struggles of musicians criminals and the others on the sidelines in showbusiness and are exploited quite well. All the same it ends up not exactly a 'great' movie because the underlying ideas for something much deeper only work up to a point. Still after a first viewing and like with most other films from the director and damned if I say it the producer too I wouldn't pass it up again on a viewing late at night it's one of the more shamelessly entertaining pictures of the mid 80s.".

	schema:headline " The Broadway version of 'The Godfather.'";
	schema:reviewBody "The Cotton Club is a dazzling complex film that attempts so much it would be almost impossible for nearly any director to pull it off. But Francis Ford Coppola is not any director so The Cotton Club is not just any movie. Rather it succeeds at practically all levels and is certainly a film worth coming back to again and again.Set in Harlem in the late 1920s we are introduced to a group of Jazz Ageproducts people who see themselves exactly as they are but all hope to go somewhere better. Two story lines occupy the plot we get a goodlooking young musician Dixie Dwyer Richard Gere who gets involved in the mob after falling for one of the gangster's girlfriends Diane Lane and we get the story of a very talented black dancer Gregory Hines trying to prove his love to a halfblack and halfwhite chorus girl who seems to struggle with her place in this more or less racist society. Almost every night everyone gathers at The Cotton Club one of the most famous clubs in the city and the blacks entertain while the whites drink and watch. But Coppola gives us a view from all angles so it doesn't feel as if we are missing anything important.One of the biggest achievements of this film is its staging of the dance sequences which are to say the least quite exquisite. Filled with colorful costumes and some mindboggling tap numbers at times you may forget that this is also a gangster picture. Indeed some scenes feel just like Coppola's The Godfather with its quick bursts of violence but also in its tone of sad elegiac setting. People come and go and some regret the things they do but the music lives on. The acting is also very strong as Gere and Lane are quite wonderful in their first of three films together. Both were very goodlooking and they do bring out the best in each other. Two supporting actors that really do steal the show are Bob Hoskins and Fred Gwynne as a mob boss and his head bodyguard. They share a tenacity and ferociousness in their dealings but also have one really terrific scene involving Gwynne coming to see Hoskins after being kidnapped. A young Nicolas Cage also shows here he had incredible potential.This Broadway version of the gangster film so familiar in Hollywood refreshes both genres as we see the similarities between the two. Indeed many of the participators in the entertainment were also involved in the mob and Coppola shows how the two lives intertwine and bring a lot of trouble to everyone. This may seem as a strange mixing of genres and story lines for some people but it is well worth the two hours. It is funny sad violent poetic but also enormously entertaining and isn't that what the movies are all about? Coppola seems to think so.".

The combination of story music and characters is as solid know as when it originally debuted. Because of the problems with the production especially the problems that Robert Evans the producer was having the picture was basically dumped and disappeared. Everyone attached to it seemed to disown it which is too bad since it ranks as good as anything Francis Ford Coppola has ever done  and he has done a lot of the greatest cinema ever made. Most if not all of Cotton Club was done on sound stages but Coppola makes the whole thing believable and he ties several stories together at once Richard Gere and Diane Lane and Gregory Hines and Lonette McKee. With the great music the original stuff by Cab Calloway Duke Ellington etc. neatly held together with new stuff by John Barry The Cotton Club is a genuine musical that for my money is more effective than Chicago that Gere would star in more than 20 years later. If you have the chance catch The Cotton Club on DVD or on cable. You will not be disappointed and if you are like me you will rank this film as a worthy cousin to Mr. Coppola's masterworks The Godfather I  II and The Conversation.".

At times it succeeds. At other times it falls way short of the mark.What I really admire is the fact that it deals with racial and ethnic friction honestly. The racial slurs in the dialog were part of the reality of that time. Relations between blacks and whites are not idealized. Richard Gere and Gregory Hines are neighbors and acquaintances but are not portrayed as close friends. When Gregory Hines prevents Dutch Schultz James Remar in a vivid characterization from killing Richard Gere he does it out of basic decency. Mercifully there are none of the sentimental relationships between blacks and whites that seem so patently false in other films.Gangland New York during the prohibition era has rarely been portrayed accurately. A worst case example was a 1991 disaster called Mobsters a.k.a. Young Tommy Guns. The Cotton Club deals with real life chracters like Owney Madden has he ever been portrayed in another film under his real name? Big Frenchy DeMange Arthur Dutch Schultz Flegenheimer a Vincent Coll standin Charlie Lucky Luciano Trigger Mike Coppola and at least in an early shooting script Jack Legs Diamond. Richard Gere's character was loosely based on George Raft.They were fascinating characters. At times The Cotton Club tries to play fair with them. It almost succeeds.On the whole this should have been a better film. Personally I would have preferred a film that focused on the real life gangsters with the music simply as background. The attempt to elevate the black characters to a position of equal importance in the narrative is the flaw that undoes the film. It's difficult to follow characters who have no power and little chance of gaining it. Obviously that is not politically correct. However I prefer for historical films to deal with life the way it really was rather than the way some people think that it should have been.All in all an interesting and honorable failure.".

But the best scene in Cotton Club is when the gorgeous Lonette McKee takes the stage to sing a stunning version of Ill Wind. She is as beautiful as young Lena Horne a feast for the eyes and ears. The director was wise not to place this number too early in the film because the movie never recovers afterward. Not that there was a lot to recover.Nick Cage is in there somewhere so is Laurence Fishburne. Joe Dallisandro makes a cameo at the end as a gangster. All he does is sit there but he was still handsome then and eyecandy was just about all the white leads offer in Cotton Club.One of these days a director is going to make a movie about the New York City of the twenties or early thirties that will have vitality and wit peopled with the legendary theatrical characters of that era Tallulah Robert Benchley the Barrymores for example. Not like the one from Alan Rudolph about Dorothy Parker Jennifer Jason Leigh and Campbell Scott tried hard to save that one but the director was all over the place as usual doing his poor Robert Altman impression.".

This is a pity because from the astonishing level of period accuracy to the actual technical skills that went into the film it is evidence of Coppola's cinematic skill and his genius for all aspects of the moviemaking process even if it falls short of being his best. Coppola as in The Godfather shows a stunning talent for casting the right person for a given part and a better cast film than this would be difficult to find. Even Joe Dallesandro as Charlie Luciano is the best portrayal of Lucky ever put on film although the physical resemblance is totally nonexistent. The period accuracy including the sets the costumes the props even the dialogue is fantastic and the only equal I've ever seen is Warren Beatty's Bugsy. The highlights of the film The cinematography especially the hauntingly beautiful lighting with copious use of classic cookie screens in the love scene with Dixie and Vera. The Felliniesque finish with action and reaction from Penn Station to The Cotton Club and back crosscutting and intermingling.  The Second Unit and montage sequences directed by Coppola's Son the late GianCarlo Coppola. The montage sequences alone are a fantastic example of what a fantastic diamond in the rough Gio was and what a fabulous director he may have turned out to be eclipsing his sister Sofia and even his Father had his life not been cut short so tragically. All in all a marvelous film well worth a second look.".

	schema:reviewBody "The great Satyajit Ray has become one of my favorite filmmakers and unfortunately it's become very difficult to see most of his films in the US. GOOPY GYNE BAGHA BYNE easily ranks as one of Ray's most intriguing creations  a wonderful family film which also contains the complex philosophies that enliven Ray's many other masterpieces. In his own film writing Ray expressed admiration for certain experimental filmmakers who came to prominence during the 50s and 60s and this film gave him an opportunity to do a bit of stylistic experimentation of his own while also creating something of a tribute to his father's and grandfather's writings. The results are one of Ray's finest films.I won't summarize the plot which is welldescribed here. But I would point out several outstanding elements of GOOPY AND BAGHA  the first would be Ray's creative use of effects  apparently the film was made on a small budget but the story is captivating enough that one doesn't really notice  such constraints force a filmmaker to rely upon his own expertise imagination and ability to improvise and innovate and in this regard GOOPY AND BAGHA almost feels like a great kids version of a 'new wave' film in the best senses of the term  willing to try the unexpected and confident that the unexpected will work well. A second strength is Ray's creation of a sophisticated family film that has much to offer adult viewers  GOOPY AND BAGHA offers a great amount of hope and strength in the face of a changing world as the film was made at a time in which momentous and troubling events were occurring throughout the globe. I'm certain that Ray was mindful of this and sought to incorporate a sophisticated engagement with changes in the outside world into the underlying philosophy in this dreamlike and magical film. Many writers have commented in vague fashion on Ray's 'humanism' but the worldview expressed is far more detailed and wideranging than that term would imply  a wellthought way of looking at life connects all of Ray's films and that includes this one.A magnificent film one very much deserving of wider appreciation around the globe.".

I grew up watching this movie watched several times and each time was none the less exciting...charming.One of Ray's great directorial acumen was to select perfect casts for the movie. If you just see the actors he chose to perform various characters in the movie you will think that the story was actually written keeping them in mind. And the actors impeccably perform their parts.This is the story about two simpleton musicians who were respectively banished by their village for their cacophonous music and coincidentally teamed up in a forest lived by ghosts. Furtunately the king of ghosts liked their music and gave them three magical boons. There started the adventure of Goopy and Bagha.Another powerful aspect of Ray's movies is their music. Mostly he composed himself. He did for this movie too. One more fact keeps you wondering is how such a fairy tale movie can be made with so less special affects and low cost. The sets were adorned with crafts and symbols that accentuate the ambiance like the Magician's room in the palace of Shundi.This is the first of the movies about adventures of Goopy Bagha. There are two more of them  Heerak Rajar Deshe In the land of Diamond King and Goopy Bagha Phire Elo Goopy Bagha Return  each worth watching the third movie is directed by Ray's son Sandip Ray.".

Furtunately the king of ghosts liked their music and gave them three magical boons. There started the adventure of Goopy and Bagha.Another powerful aspect of Ray's movies is their music. Mostly he composed himself. He did for this movie too. One more fact keeps you wondering is how such a fairy tale movie can be made with so less special affects and low cost. The sets were adorned with crafts and symbols that accentuate the ambiance like the Magician's room in the palace of Shundi.This is the first of the movies about adventures of Goopy Bagha. There are two more of them  Heerak Rajar Deshe In the land of Diamond King and Goopy Bagha Phire Elo Goopy Bagha Return  each worth watching the third movie is directed by Ray's son Sandip Ray.";

This film and it's sequel are unique for Satyajit Ray who except for some tongueincheek detective filmsspent his cinematic career portraying the conflicts and contradictions of modern Indian society in films that are both realistic and poetic like the films of his mentor Jean Renoir. Many of them feature characters trying to make the transition from traditional villagebased life to modern urban life e.g. the Apu trilogy Mahanaghar or trying to preserve traditions in a world that no longer has a place for them e.g. Jalsaghar. This is one of the main themes of African literature and cinema as well.Many of Ray's films also show women trapped by tradition Devi Charulata or using their education and ingenuity to escape from it Mahanagar. But in the fairy tale world of Goopy and Bagha both talent and opportunity are given them by divine intervention because their desire to make music attracts the deity's attention. And when one of them is betrothed to a princess leaving the other emptyhanded a local king obligingly asks if they need another princess. Contrast this with the plight of Apu in the real India looking for a job after graduating from college. A prospective employer shows him a large room full of people who spend all day every day sorting old buttons into trays.As other reviewers have mentioned Ray's fantasy is beautifully photographed and full of realistic psychological detail as well as sly humor which draw us effortlessly into the story.

	schema:reviewBody "Reviewed on the basis of watching on Video 44 years after releasePlot Goopy and Bagha after being exiled from their villages encounter a gang of ghosts in a bambooforest. The king of the ghosts grants them 3 boons which bestow them with supernatural powers. They soon head to Shundi where news arrives of the imminent attack by the kingdom of Halla. The king of Shundi sends them to Halla for espionage to prevent this war. Will Goopy and Bagha be able to save Shundi by using their magical powers?Review 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne' written by Upendra Kishore Roychowdhury has forever been a children's favourite. So when his able grandson the great Satyajit Ray decided to adapt this book for the bigscreen expectations were bound to surge. And it's a joy to say that they have been far exceeded!Although the genre of children's films was not totally absent yet in the 60's they were still hard to come by. With the filmyscenario ruled by emotional dramas and occasional comedies Ray's version comes as a refreshing diversion not only in mainstream Bengali cinema but also in Ray's own body of work. Considering the Aputrilogy was not meant for children 'GGBB' was the first of the many children's films to roll out from Ray's stable. The fact that this film is meant to entertain the children is evident from the characters and their mannerisms. Most of the characters are often seen behaving in a childish manner be it in their animated expression of anger fear and wholehearted laughter and breaking into spontaneous jigs with crazy lyrics. Plus the unprecedented special effects to go with it. All of this makes an instant connect with the little ones is undeniable. There is a distinct feel of comedy running throughout the film seen before only in 'Parash Pathar' and 'Mahapurush'.But it would be a huge misstatement to regard 'GGBB' only as a kiddy flick. Just like any film of a great director this film also communicates with its viewers in different layers. While it might not mean much more than fun entertainment for the adolescents it conveys an antiwar message for the greyhairs by discouraging wars among 'brothers' a theme that shall remain as relevant till eternity.The film begins with a lighthearted tone and it doesn't budge from it for an instant. But as the film progresses and the actual devilry of the minister and his magician become gradually apparent the gravity of the story gets well understood. Yet all this is conveyed subconsciously without once breaking the ambiance of fun which is where Ray's mastery stands well distinguished.Tapen Chatterjee as the bumpkin Goopy with a childish smile and expressions is a great discovery. Robi Ghosh after 'Galpo Holeo Sotti' gets another lead role as the ambitious commanding and shrewd Bagha and he does full justice to it. Although a better wig could have been expected. Jahar Roy is suitably cast as a comic villain in the role of the banditturnedcunning minister. Harindranath Chatterjee as the evil magician Barfi who speaks in an alien tongue and resides in a curiously designed den is a revelation. His total getup movements phonetically hilarious dialoguedelivery and occasional expressions of the man who knows it all are marvelous. But the showstealer is undoubtedly Santosh Dutta in a virtual triple role. While the kindhearted king of Shundi is a cakewalk for him he shows his class as the dualsided king of Halla. He is flawless as the innocencepersonified twin brother with a lovable voice who turns into the executionerloving tyrant upon being drugged. The contrast in bodylanguage and dialoguedelivery is simply brilliant. A special mention has to be made of the character of the 'smiling assassin' wickedly flaunting all his teeth all the time. Kudos to Ray for creating this character which appears in just two scenes doesn't utter a single word yet leaves a deep impression. It's due to him Jahar and Santosh that the whole sequence involving the foreign delegates becomes my favourite from the film.But the character which over the years has become synonymous with Goopy  Bagha is the iconic 'Bhooter Raja'. Immortally voiced by Ray himself the king creates a lasting impression not only with his incredible appearance but also with his largesse. This one of the earliest appearances of a ghost in Bengali cinema certainly played a big role in altering people's perception towards the supernatural.A trulygifted never ceases to amaze with hisher bounty of talents. Such is the case with Ray. After spellbinding the world with his film making and writing skills he decides to bowl us over with his music and lyrical talents. Barring 'Jalshaghar' before this hardly any other Ray flick featured separately composed songs. Wonder why when he could create songs like these! He garnishes the film with eight masterpieces different in taste and feel. The lyrics are thoughtprovoking or insane but always simple. 'O Mantrimashai' is my personal favourite. Unearthing Anup Ghosal as Goopy's voice deserves credit so does the odd choice of actor Kanu Mukherjee for the song 'Halla choleche juddhe'.Yet the script has some minor loopholes. When Bagha plays his drum to please the kids they don't become 'spellbound' in the literal sense. When the sentries capture Goopy and Bagha Goopy could have easily started singing and escape unless he was gagged which then should have been shown. The first message received by the king of Shundi was in some pictorial language while later he received another one in pure Bengali both from Halla! The ability of Goopy and Bagha to order the sweets to drop from the skies is also debatable but can be pardoned considering the cinematic effect it creates.Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne shall forever remain a distinguished film in Ray's filmography for the fact that it is his only allout mainstream entertainer. But more importantly it's a classic children's fare that shall enthrall generations to come.".

	onyx:emotionText "Reviewed on the basis of watching on Video 44 years after releasePlot Goopy and Bagha after being exiled from their villages encounter a gang of ghosts in a bambooforest. The king of the ghosts grants them 3 boons which bestow them with supernatural powers. They soon head to Shundi where news arrives of the imminent attack by the kingdom of Halla. The king of Shundi sends them to Halla for espionage to prevent this war. Will Goopy and Bagha be able to save Shundi by using their magical powers?Review 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne' written by Upendra Kishore Roychowdhury has forever been a children's favourite. So when his able grandson the great Satyajit Ray decided to adapt this book for the bigscreen expectations were bound to surge. And it's a joy to say that they have been far exceeded!Although the genre of children's films was not totally absent yet in the 60's they were still hard to come by. With the filmyscenario ruled by emotional dramas and occasional comedies Ray's version comes as a refreshing diversion not only in mainstream Bengali cinema but also in Ray's own body of work. Considering the Aputrilogy was not meant for children 'GGBB' was the first of the many children's films to roll out from Ray's stable. The fact that this film is meant to entertain the children is evident from the characters and their mannerisms. Most of the characters are often seen behaving in a childish manner be it in their animated expression of anger fear and wholehearted laughter and breaking into spontaneous jigs with crazy lyrics. Plus the unprecedented special effects to go with it. All of this makes an instant connect with the little ones is undeniable. There is a distinct feel of comedy running throughout the film seen before only in 'Parash Pathar' and 'Mahapurush'.But it would be a huge misstatement to regard 'GGBB' only as a kiddy flick. Just like any film of a great director this film also communicates with its viewers in different layers. While it might not mean much more than fun entertainment for the adolescents it conveys an antiwar message for the greyhairs by discouraging wars among 'brothers' a theme that shall remain as relevant till eternity.The film begins with a lighthearted tone and it doesn't budge from it for an instant. But as the film progresses and the actual devilry of the minister and his magician become gradually apparent the gravity of the story gets well understood. Yet all this is conveyed subconsciously without once breaking the ambiance of fun which is where Ray's mastery stands well distinguished.Tapen Chatterjee as the bumpkin Goopy with a childish smile and expressions is a great discovery. Robi Ghosh after 'Galpo Holeo Sotti' gets another lead role as the ambitious commanding and shrewd Bagha and he does full justice to it. Although a better wig could have been expected. Jahar Roy is suitably cast as a comic villain in the role of the banditturnedcunning minister. Harindranath Chatterjee as the evil magician Barfi who speaks in an alien tongue and resides in a curiously designed den is a revelation. His total getup movements phonetically hilarious dialoguedelivery and occasional expressions of the man who knows it all are marvelous.

Ajit stays with him since his wife is out in Ghatsila.

Movie character Byomkesh has a pet baby python keeps a human skeleton in his room and has no problem drinking scotch in the evening. Book character was fairly lazy to own a pet too cerebral to actually study anatomy and in spite of being a habitual smoker never drank. Not that I mind the cinematic deviations but there should be a strong logic behind each. While I can understand the room being too drag without the skeleton and the snake  I cannot get the point of Byomkesh being single. May be Ray's ideal sleuth was tall cerebral and deliciously single as we see later in form of Feluda.Uttamkumar is just about average as Byomkesh. There are two weaknesses that would draw a lot of attention today. His mimic of a Japanese horticulturist is too over the top and secondly his character was needlessly rough with the characters of the farm from very beginning.Overall this is one of Ray's average movies. It's surprising that this was awarded the best picture in 1967 in India and Uttam won the Bharat India's then version of Oscar for best actor award for his role.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reviewed on the basis of watching on T.V. 36 years after releasePlot An exjudge Nishanath Sen invites the famous sleuth Byomkesh Bakshi and his associate Ajit to his residential colony. The colony is inhabited by peculiar people most of whom are social outcasts and hence has got the name 'chiriyakhana' zoo. Nishanath also asks Byomkesh to inquire about all the details of a singercumheroine of an erstwhile Bengali film. Soon news arrives that Nishanath has been brutally murdered in his colony. Will Byomkesh be able to nab the culprit from among the weird residents of the 'chiriyakhana'?ReviewByomkesh Bakshi the dhotipanjabi clad Bangalee gentleman sleuth who prefers to call himself a 'satyanneshi' has been a household favourite since being introduced by Sharadindu Bannerjee in the 1930's. As a result when it was announced that Uttam Kumar and Satyajit Ray the greatest star and director in the history of Bengali cinema respectively would again join forces one year after the classic 'Nayak' 1966 to bring one of the biggest Byomkeshbestsellers 'Chiriyakhana' onto the bigscreen expectations were bound to be skyhigh. Were the expectations fulfilled? Depends on whether the viewer is a Byomkesh fan or not.If one is a diehard fan of the 'satyanneshi'stories and expects to see an equal reflection of the sleuth in Uttam Kumar then there is a clear word of advice STAY FAR AWAY! For it should be made clear at the beginning itself that barring the title of the story and names of the characters the whole story and characterizations have been altered insideout by the director including Byomkesh and his accomplice Ajit. This Byomkesh is a complete Rayproduct bearing no stamp of Sharadindu.Let us start from the beginning. A unique charm and specialty about Byomkesh has been the fact that he is married is a father and is as worldlyminded like any common Bangalee and yet he never allows that to be a hindrance to his profession. This makes his task more challenging than a Sherlock Holmes or a Feluda. But Ray models Byomkesh on his own creation Feluda and makes him a bachelor. Instead the foreverbachelor Ajit becomes a married man here. Another shock which the viewers are exposed to right at the start is Basuki a snake which has been domesticated by the onscreen Byomkesh but would have been unimaginable for the literary Byomkesh who is a common familyman. So was the skeleton hanging in his study. Whatever remaining expectations of any similarities are thoroughly crushed when our Bangalee 'satyanneshi' proudly acknowledges his taste for everything and accepts a glass of whiskey from a colourful host! This trait was undoubtedly drawn by Ray from the Western spies and clearly established the fact that this Byomkesh is not a conventional Bangalee 'gentleman'. Although we don't know much about the literary Byomkesh's taste for cinema it was hilarious to see the 'Mahanayak' expressing his abject disapproval for contemporary Bengali cinema especially after 'Nayak' a year back. Another interesting point is the camaraderie between Byomkesh and Ajit where they alternately address each other as both 'tumi' and 'tui' while in the books it's always strictly 'tumi' even after years of acquaintance.For fans of the novel also it could be a huge disappointment. It's adequate to say it would be much easier to mark the similarities than to point out the differences! But if one is willing to ignore the novel then one must applaud the director for weaving a totally different story from someone else's premise and characters and yet delivering quiet an engaging whodunitthriller. It's still tough to understand the reason why anyone should tamper with a perfectly fine story give it his own shape and still give its credit to the original writer! A viewer ignorant of the novel would praise or criticise Sharadindu if he likes or dislikes the filmstory where else in reality it's Ray who should be held accountable for both.Ray takes all liberties in molding his Byomkesh and soon the viewers also begin to enjoy the fun. Amidst the barrage of alterations there is one sequence where the director must be patted on the back for wriggling out of a really dilemmatic situation. In the novel the main culprit passes on a cyanide ampule to his wife by engaging in a long liplock with her. It goes without saying such a sequence would have created a mass uproar back then and yet Ray was not a director who would settle for a cheatkiss. Hence it was an indescribable relief when he steered clear of any such controversy and unearthed a climax which was wholly acceptable to a conservative family audience. A heartfelt thanks to the master for sparing me the blushes in front of my parents!As for the performances Uttam Kumar brought his heroic personality to the character just as Soumitra Chatterjee would go on to do for Feluda. Although he gave it a more serious touch sacrificing on the sense of humour of the literary avatar. It was amusing to see him in the getup of a Japanese horticulturist Okakhora with the characteristic fleet footed walk besides portraying a Kabuliwala as well. The only odd point that strikes is Uttam's height as Japanese are seldom so tall. Shailen Mukherjee as Ajit is good. He is quite funny when Byomkesh brings Basuki near him or when he asks Dr. Das fearfully if he had ever been to Japan. Chinmoy Roy was also quite funny in asking to take his photo or when he was doing a 'namashkar' while holding a pup all along. Special mention must be made of Subrota Mukherjee during the interrogation scene which was hilarious. Jahar Ganguly and the inspector were the others who impressed.Overall 'Chiriyakhana' is Ray's best thriller beating the two Feluda adventures which were based on his own story. It might even have been better if he had made this film outside the brandByomkesh. The diehard 'satyanneshi' fans would surely agree.".

	schema:headline " Worst film of Satyajit Ray";
	schema:reviewBody "This is coming from a big fan of Uttam Kumar Satyajit and Sharadindu  This is not only THE WORST movie made by Satyajit Ray but it may be one of the most boring detective movie ever made. Period. From 1997 I tried to watch this 4 times at night and every time I slept in the middle. Due to a lot of courage and love for the original book last year 2009 I could watch it completely after waking up. I cannot believe that the director and screen writer was Satyajit Ray. It does not show any characteristic of Ray.There was only one thing that got murdered in the film and that was the book named Chiriya Khana. The original story by Sharadindu was weak but engrossing. I read it a few times just because of the fluency of the writer and I have no problem in reading it again. Sharadindu's writing reminds me of a calm river smoothly flowing towards the ocean. Even a weak story can be so attractive just because of his writing skill. However the movie is a different media and Ray's version did not do the necessary adjustments to make it even remotely interesting.Apart from being slow the movie looks contrived some changes are overthetop and unnecessary e.g. baby python skeleton posters Japanese horticulturist. Why the heck a Bengali guy would disguise as a Japanese skin color facial structure eyes? Isn't it easy to disguise as another Bengali or at least a Marathi Punjabi etc?The acting was OK actors looked drugged but they are victims of a poor screen play. As far as Uttam Kumar's Byomkesh goes it is just another detective but not Byomkesh Bakshi.The end was quick but that was probably the best part of the film because it stops the torture on the viewers.I don't know how it received so many awards and how some people gave it so high ratings. I can only guess that since we bengalis don't get to see too many Bengali detective flicks we applause whatever comes in our way. Sigh!!!".

	schema:headline " The weakest film of Satyajit Ray";
	schema:reviewBody "Chiriakhana The Zoo made in 1967 should be considered the weakest and the worst film made by Satyajit Ray. It is not due to the fact that cinematographic deviations are not allowed but every such deviation should be with a purpose. Purposeless deviations should be criticized. Deviations in the film from the story.1. Byomkesh is married to Satyavati at the time of the story's setting whereas Ajit is a bachelor. The movie says just the opposite.2. Since Byomkesh is married he lives in his apartment along with Ajit and not in a mess as shown in the film. The apartment is lot tidier as he is married.3. Byomkesh's mannerisms are not what have been shown in the movie. He does not drink but frequently smokes and drinks tea doesn't put up collages on the wall doesn't keep a human skeleton never kept a pet snake.4. In the original story Byomkesh never took a disguise. In the film he is shown to resort to disguise at least twice once as the Japanese named Okakura and once as a Pathan.5. The full name of Byomkesh's assistant is Ajit Bandyopadhyay. In the film it is seen twice that he introduces Ajit as Ajit Chakraborty.6. The climax scene in the movie is an anticlimax. The phrase Dantaruchi Koumudi is never mentioned in the movie which added another dimension to the climax scene in the story.Another omission in the movie is that when Byomkesh arrives for the first time to Mohanpur railway station for Golap Colonydisguised as Okakura the approaching train is shown to be an EMU electric local train. In the next scene the train is seen as a passenger train being hauled by an electric locomotive.Considering Ray's reputation of looking into finer details I would consider this film to be worst ever made by Satyajit Ray. I doubt whether the film was ever directed by him. It must have been directed by somebody else with Ray busy in a bigger project. This is my assumption I have no proof for this statement. The acting is just average with none excelling other than Nripati Chatterjee as Mushkil Miyan. Uttam Kumar was not a perfect choice for Byomkesh's character as his well known mannerisms do not match with the character of Byomkesh Bakshi.".

Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. When you rewrite a script it gets better and better tells EdJohnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks I don't know but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like Nick of Time The Astronaut's Wife and Secret Window He belongs to the world of real great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a safe tired Stephen King thing. Johnny remember we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods  please!".

	schema:headline " Burton's grand masterpiece too bad so few have noticed";
	schema:reviewBody "As one of the most overlooked films ever made Ed Wood does for Tim Burton what Malcolm X did for Spike Lee and JFK did for Oliver Stone it ruins any expectations one can have of Tim Burton because he has set a standard here that he will never achieve again.  An interest in the period in which it is set is essential given the set decoration is the film's greatest triumph.  It's not surprising that Burton's first biopic is about someone revered in the bmovie heyday of the 1950s  that spawned Burton himself. Burton must have felt he had to make this picture because without filmmakers like Ed Wood Burton himself would have never existed. Set in seedy Bmovie Hollywood in the mid 1950s  and wisely and beautifully shot in blackandwhite Johnny Depp plays the titular character a young talentless but optimistic auteur who dreams of being a film director going so far as to model himself after his idol Orson Welles.  Despite an overreliance on stock footage a tin ear for dialogue and a fondness for wacky exploitative horror and scifi fare Wood wiggles his way into Bmoviedom.  Casting anyone willing to step before his camera Wood cranks out a series of cheesy movies.When he has a chance encounter with horror film legend Bela Lugosi now a 74 yearold foulmouthed morphine addict wrecked by his lost fame Ed sees his mealticket. Quick for his next fix Lugosi doesn't seem to mind that Wood is also an outandproud transvestite with a particular fondness for Angora sweaters and soon begins starring in Wood's features. Lugosi played by Martin Landau gives the story its biggest jolts of energy. Landau is hysterical in scene after scene utilizing the dirty old man routine. Remember there is nothing funnier on earth than an old man who likes profanity.  A gentle  albeit somewhat fictionalized  bond forms between Wood and Lugosi.  Depp does a spectacular job of fleshing out Wood's quirky innocence and unbridled passion for moviemaking.  This may also be the only Johnny Depp film where you actually see him smile!What ultimately makes this film so stellar is the impeccable production and costume design and the crisp BW cinematography it literally transports you back to the cleancut wideeyed days of the 1950s.  I cannot recommend this film enough if you have an interest in the world of 1950s Bmovies that produced titles like Teenagers From Outer Space and Project Moonbase. This film functions quite well as a time warp.  I liken Ed Wood to epics like JFK because like those films this movie doesn't seem to be about what happens as much as how it FEELS to be there and that's what draws me to the film every time I see it.  With Ed Wood I'm not always interested in following the story but I'm totally fascinated with being inside that world.  Tim Burton did the best job that anyone could in taking you there.".

Angora sweaters and childish dreams. The purity of an artist with a talent that is concentrated in his heart. Remember the Salieri of Amadeus torturing himself cursing God for giving him the gift of recognising the talent in others without having any of his own. Ed Wood as told by Burton and Depp is so far away from that pathology that to watch his films after having met him with Johnny's face is an entirely different experience. Everything makes sense. Strangely enough or not Ed Wood died at the box office but as it happens more often than not Ed Wood is more alive today than many of the greatest moneymakers of all time.

Had it not been for the prestige that Tim Burton had already earned from his previous projects ED WOOD would no doubt have foundered long before the cameras began to roll.  The result could have been another 1941  but it wasn't.  What came out of Tim Burton's fascination with the Worst Director of All Time' was something very rich and strange  perhaps the most unHollywood Hollywood picture of the 90s.I see two main themes in ED WOOD.  The first is the dreadful fear that hovers over everyone who enters the creative arts  Am I any good?'  Is my work any good?'  How do I know if it's any good?'  What if I think it's good but everybody else thinks it's rubbish?'  Artists use all kinds of strategies to deal with these fears  some become eccentric others arrogant others diffident.  Without the right to fail no artist is likely to take the sort of risk that sometimes just sometimes leads to great work.  Tim Burton knew this.Edward D Wood Jnr believed himself to be a creative artist.  Oh how he believed.  But he still failed to create anything worthwhile.  And this leads to what I believe to be the second theme of the movie and the reason why I think it failed commercially.Look at all the things Ed did right.  He believed in himself.  He followed his dream.  He worked hard.  He was an entrepreneur  he did his best to make others believe in his dream and help him to turn it into reality.  In short he did all the things that the selfhelp books the daytime TV shows the junk ballads and the feelgood movies tell us will give you success. Just wish upon a star work all the hours there are to turn your vision into reality and you will succeed.  Ed did all of these things.  And still he failed.  He died short of his 60th birthday living in a crimeriddled apartment building drunk broke supporting himself and his loyal wife Kathy by writing formula pornography and making sex instruction flicks on 8mm.America doesn't want to hear this.  Hollywood doesn't want to tell America this  that you can try and try and try and still get nothing but heartbreak.

	schema:reviewBody "It's sort of embarrassing to admit it took me ten years to see this film. I'm not really a big fan of Tim Burton and while I never had anything against him I've only recently started to enjoy Johnny Depp's work. Given the subject matter this just wasn't a movie I was interested in for a long time. But sometimes good things really are worth the wait.Ed Wood of course chronicles the Hollywood career of its eponymous subject truly one screwed up individual a crossdresser with a fetish for angora Wood churned out one horrifically bad film after another culminating with Plan Nine From Outer Space before descending into crappy porn films toward the end of his life. It isn't necessarily a happy story and Burton wisely only tells a small sliver of it from Ed's first movie Glen or Glenda through the premiere of Plan Nine.But the love that Burton has for Wood and his movies shines through in every frame. Though I find Burton needlessly artsy as a director here that tendency serves him frightfully well as he manages to do the nearimpossible make a film about someone that plays like one of their films the abysmal Dragon is a shining example of how NOT to do this. Shot entirely in black and white we see all of Wood's weirdos not as they were but rather as Ed probably saw them through the bizarre filter he must have viewed life with.Depp is simply brilliant here probably even better than he was in Pirates of the Caribbean. He captures Wood's enthusiasm and slanted viewpoint but he does so in a loving positive way. Wood accepts as we must that he was a screwedup hack but it never drags him down in fact Depp has him reveling in it and it is that very passion that buoys up the movie. It doesn't hurt that nearly everyone else is very strong too from Jeffrey Jones' crank 'psychic' Criswell to Bill Murray's Bunny Breckenridge who often talks about having a sex change but never goes through with it. George 'The Animal' Steele captures Tor Johnson perfectly and even Lisa Marie is excellent as Vampira. But the true great performance of the film outshining even Depp is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. He won the Oscar for this and deservedly so he presents Lugosi at the end of his life a washedup has been a shell of a man who was once a great star but is now no more than an addict. Landau virtually disappears in the role and all you get is Lugosi every tragic inch of him. Again we see him not only as he was but how Wood and even Burton see him and the effect is masterful. One speech in particular where Lugosi repeats a speech that Wood wrote for him about once being the master of the world but now on the verge of coming back is particularly haunting and Landau is simply riveting.Ed Wood is a rare beast  it's a Tim Burton film that doesn't go overboard it's a movie about Hollywood sort of that isn't selfindulgent it's a nostalgia trip that manages not to be sappy but is still very warm and caring and overall it's just a strikingly welldone film. I was impressed on many levels most particularly with Depp and Landau but really with the whole movie that such a truly screwedup human being could be shown in such a positive indeed loving way. Ed Wood is nothing less than a tribute to its subject and in that as in many other ways it succeeds marvelously. If somehow you've missed this film as I had until recently you owe it to yourself to see it. It's simply a wonderful piece of filmmaking that should not be missed.".

Wood Jr. widely know these days as the worst movie director of all time. It tells the story with lot's of humor but it never gets disrespectful or makes fun of Wood. Instead you actually will gain lot's of respect for his passion and his will power to make just that one movie that he would always be remembered for. The story of Edward D. Wood Jr. is tragic but the movie never becomes sad. It is the perfect homage and tribute to this unfortunate director. You can see by watching this movie that Tim Burton in a way really admires Wood's life and his work.We get to see Wood as a filmmaker and as an individual. We get to know his weird lifestyle and his eccentric famous friendsOK the movie might no be a completely fair biography about Wood. It takes lot's of liberties with telling the story and it only shows the bright days of Wood's life but as movie it works really well and is next to Edward Sciccorhands Burton's best movie till date truly a masterpiece!The cast is terrific. Johnn Depp in a Tim Burton movie is always jackpot. Sarah Jessica Parker impressed me and Martin Landau truly is perfect as Bela Lugosi. Bill Murray does what he can best acting crazy! The Danny Elfman like music by Howard Shore is really great and also great as an homage to the 50's horror soundtracks.The movie works both as a comedy and as a drama. It knows to find the perfect balance but mainly still the movie is just extremely fun to watch. The movie really has tons of laughs and is filled with some incredible crazy character's but like I said before it never becomes disrespectful to anyone.I must say that Ed Wood really changed my life. It got me interested in not just only Ed Wood movies but 50's horror movies in general. It also made me a big fan of the famous Hammer film's.A brilliant strange tragic fun homage to the man who will always be remembered as the worst director of all time.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

This film goes beyond pastiche and beyond homage to a genre although it is both. With this film Burton genuflectsno prostrates himselfbefore the gods of 1950s lowbudget black and white and the gods are pleased indeed. It seems like he must have watched every movie made in America for under a million dollars between 1948 and 1962.

And shortly after the movie began they walked out. I wonder if they asked for their money back. I hope they didn't get it.The movie was ED WOOD Tim Burton's homage to trashfilm director Edward D. Wood Jr. which only played in Greenville for two weeks and did not show up at the secondrun movie houses. Apparently no one wanted to see it. Their loss.But perhaps I'm being too hard on those who don't appreciate the subtle nuances of Eddie Wood's movies. To me Eddie was a glittering bead hanging on Hollywood's lunatic fringe. However Eddie a transvestite who often directed his masterpieces wearing high heels and an angora sweater was not exactly your mama's director. He was no Frank Tashlin who tried to make Jayne Mansfield respectable in THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT. He was no Norman Taurog who made Elvis look like a dork in countless girlscarsandguitars flicks. He wasn't even Russ Meyer whose exploitation films are legendary in their trashiness. No Eddie just never seemed to get a break. He wanted to be Orson Welles. He didn't even find the measure of fame accorded to Orson Bean! He remained a pathetic outcast forever a fringie.Perhaps it is appropriate that Johnny Depp was chosen to portray Eddie Wood. Depp has a long history of playing outcasts and fringies  Edward Scissorhands Gilbert Grape Hunter Thompson. Depp makes it clear that Eddie's angoracovered heart was in the right place. He worked hard on his scripts he gave important roles to spectacularly talentless actors like Vampira wrestler Tor Johnson and Eddie's own main squeeze Dolores Fuller. And he was very kind to the drugaddled hasbeen Bela Lugosi even dissuading the drunken Drac from committing suicide which wasn't entirely altruistic perhaps as Lugosi had threatened to take Eddie with him. Depp makes Eddie appear almost human.Depp's portrayal is just one of several that are outstanding George The Animal Steele as Tor Johnson Jeffrey Jones as Criswell Vincent D'Onofrio in his cameo of Orson Welles and Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge  one of the rare times Murray has immersed himself in his character and not been merely Bill Murray with someone else's name. Also delightful is a brief appearance by organist Korla Pandit 1950's television personality once billed The Prince of the Wurlitzer.However all the performances in ED WOOD are overshadowed by Academyaward winner Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. For those enough old enough to remember Landau in TV's Mission Impossible it perhaps isn't surprising that Landau was able to hide so completely behind a spookily accurate makeup job seeing Landau's Lugosi watch himself on television was eerie because Landau looked enough like Lugosi to make it seem real.The film ends on a high note which Eddie's life didn't  he died in his sleep watching a ball game just a few days after he'd been evicted from his apartment.ED WOOD is not a family film. Some of the language is strong drugs and drink are abundant and many of the characters are a shade on the bizarre side. It might be hard to explain to one's children why this apparently virile man loves to raid his girlfriend's closets.Unfortunately ED WOOD hasn't exactly burned up the box office. Perhaps it is because so few people can relate to someone as weird as Eddie with his terrible stories about men in angora sweaters killer octopi blankeyed wrestler slaves and the piece de resistance aliens with eight failed plans to take over the universe. I believe Eddie himself felt like those aliens which is why viewing PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE he said This is the one I'll be remembered by. And perhaps that very weirdness made the story appealing to me. Having lived as a misfit and outcast working hard all my life to reach a goal that has remained elusive I can to quote someone I don't care for feel Eddie's pain. It's too late for him but perhaps there's hope for me yet ...".

	schema:reviewBody "It's truly ironic that Tim Burton was able to make such a great masterpiece out of the life story of Edward D. Wood Jr. The least you can say is that his life wasn't. What makes this film so great is that Burton never makes fun of Ed Wood. His way of filmmaking his lifestyle and his vision of things are always shown with respect. It's obvious that Burton didn't intend to make a comedy about Hollywood but a drama about a man with a dream to make films. And he won't give up that dream no matter what. I'm a great fan of Tim Burton. Especially when he casts Johnny Depp in the leading role. Edward Sciccorhands Sleepy Hollow and this Ed Wood can easily make the top 50 films of ALL TIME. There's chemistry on the screen when those 2 work together. And Johnny is not alone this time. The Oscar that Martin Landau received for his role of Bela Lugosi is perhaps one of the most deserved ones in the history of the Academy Awards. He's very creepy as the washed up actor but very pathetic at the same time. It really is an outstanding performance. Patricia Arquette is just adorable as Kathy the woman who stays with Edward in good and bad days. She's always giving him support believes in him accepts him as he is  his confession to her in the spook house is really heartbreaking  Lisa Marie is really sexy as Vampire. People can think she receives all her roles because she sleeps with the director but she really can act. Very well as the matter a fact. One little disappointment maybe I was hoping the role of Orson Welles  played by Vincent D'Onofrio  one genius plays another one  would have been a little bigger. Ed Wood is one of the best films of the 90's... what am I saying ? One of the best films EVER !!!".

	schema:headline " One of the most charming movies ever";
	schema:reviewBody "When thinking about Ed Wood there is a word that always comes to my mind in first charm. This movie oozes a worthiness for loving it few movies do. Because underneath its mix of genres it's the most unnoticed one which ends up revealing itself as the most important affecting drama.Ed Wood is an allaround player. It has tons of humor white and dark including many comic scenes and hilarious characters. It has an experimental feel too reflected on a couple of bizarre shots. It is an impeccable drama full of feeling and transcendent events. But in the end Ed Wood is overall a sort of a romantic comedy between the characters and the audience. I know it sounds pedantic and weird but remember this thought when the final credits roll.What does this feeling come from? It comes from Tim Burton's genuine love for the characters. No matter how pathetic they are Tim shows love for them in every shot and he shows it so well that the affection is contagious. You just can't help but feel that Ed Bela Tor and Vampira have been there in your life forever. They are family.And just because of that the film is so affecting. Bash me if you want but Bela Lugosi's death saddened me more than 200 dramas. The affectionate friendship between Ed and Bela is touching and Bela's death put an end to that. It also helped the fact that Martin Landau nails the character playing the role of his life. His performance is one of the most astonishing I've ever seen and clearly one of the three main reasons to watch this movie. Hats off.Tim Burton is in top form too constructing in my opinion an almost perfect film that ranks first in his work. Other Burton's movies are tremendous but this simply has it all awesome performances intelligent script prominent aesthetics historical accuracy although this is not an inherent value in Burton's work it is here and a jawdropping direction. Just take a look at the scene that takes place inside the spook train and you'll know what I'm saying. There's a care for detail too that shows in credits music...And one more thing if you don't laugh with this film you're dead.RATING 9.8".

You just can't help but feel that Ed Bela Tor and Vampira have been there in your life forever. They are family.And just because of that the film is so affecting. Bash me if you want but Bela Lugosi's death saddened me more than 200 dramas. The affectionate friendship between Ed and Bela is touching and Bela's death put an end to that. It also helped the fact that Martin Landau nails the character playing the role of his life. His performance is one of the most astonishing I've ever seen and clearly one of the three main reasons to watch this movie. Hats off.Tim Burton is in top form too constructing in my opinion an almost perfect film that ranks first in his work. Other Burton's movies are tremendous but this simply has it all awesome performances intelligent script prominent aesthetics historical accuracy although this is not an inherent value in Burton's work it is here and a jawdropping direction. Just take a look at the scene that takes place inside the spook train and you'll know what I'm saying. There's a care for detail too that shows in credits music...And one more thing if you don't laugh with this film you're dead.RATING 9.8";

They have the same problems and the same ambitions. The fact that one is a genius and the other a total failure is only secondary.The performances are all firstrate starting with Depp and Landau and going all the way to the supporting cast which includes a great performance by Bill Murray. Opposing Ed Wood's statement that filmmaking is not about the tiny details Tim Burton gave us another great film filled with wonderful details.The film does not go into detail about Wood's experiences prior to and after making his first films which is understandable when you make a little research on this very website.This film made me curious about Ed Wood's work and maybe I'll get over myself and check out Plan 9 from Outer Space or Glen or Glenda.8.510".

But there are other equally eccentric people drawn to Wood the most interesting being Bunny Breckinridge a surprisingly good performance by Bill Murray Vampira Lisa Marie and Criswell Jeffrey Jones that otherworldly seer of the future. The misfit label applies to Wood too of course who directs his actors dressed in women's clothes seemingly oblivious to the managerial discordance of such attire.The script's characters and the film's highcontrast BW lighting combine to portray Hollywood as a comically nightmarish place of delusional unreality.

BIG FISH was a welcome exception but SLEEPY HOLLOW and PLANET OF THE APES were rather dull and formulaic. APES even more so especially considering the awesome 1968 original by Franklin Schaffner. In my opinion and mine alone Burton's best film was also one of his biggest financial duds at the box office ED WOOD ironic considering the film is a biopic of a dismally unsuccessful filmmaker. But ED as a movie it's NOT a terribly accurate biographical account is a cheesy voyage to the bottom of bad movies and the people who make them. The film takes some liberties with the true tale of Edward D. Wood Jr. a hack '50s director whose 'masterpieces' include JAIL BAIT GLEN OR GLENDA a surreal crapfest about transvestites BRIDE OF THE MONSTER and the infamous PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE despite its worst film ever reputation there ARE worse Phil Tucker's ROBOT MONSTER for example. ED WOOD chronicles a roughly 5 yr. span 19538 in Wood's strange tragically short life he died in 1978 at age 54. During this period he churned out three of the aforementioned 'classics.' In his portrayal of Wood Johnny Depp really owns this movie. His performance is a deft blend of childlike optimism coupled with a cynical conman's cunning. Forget the PIRATES franchise THIS is Depp's best. Sarah Jessica Parker purposefully overacting just a bit which works well for this film plays Delores Fuller Wood's longsuffering girlfriend who eventually leaves him for a normal life writing Elvis tunes. Patricia Arquette plays Wood's replacement girlfriend and soontobe longsuffering wife Kathy. But the most poignant relationship in the film is the eccentric fatherson bond that develops between Wood and his star drugaddled washedup exboogieman Bela Lugosi Martin Landau in a deserved Oscarwinning role. Their relationship echoes Tim Burton's own reallife collaboration with the late Vincent Price. It's one of the many reasons that of all of Burton's films this one feels the most personal even more so than SCISSORHANDS. And the gorgeous black and white photography effortlessly evokes '50s Bmovies or in this case Zmovies. Many good performances round out the film Bill Murray excels as aging drag queen John Bunny Breckinridge in what could easily have been a jokey onenote role. But the film is at its best when the focus is on Wood and Lugosi. In this romanticized version of Ed Wood's life Wood gives Lugosi's final declining years a real sense of purpose. In return Lugosi gives Wood fatherly love prompting Wood to become the doting son during the worst of Lugosi's manic fits of depression and addiction. In fact the shifty manipulative Wood only seems truly sincere and honest when interacting with Lugosi. When the aging actor finally dies after decades of drug abuse Wood relives their final scenes shot together in an heartbreaking scene to the strains of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. Far greater artistry is employed in this film than Wood himself could have ever conceived of let alone for his OWN biopic! Even composer Howard Shore's evocative '50s scifi inspired musical score is pitch perfect right down to the use of bongo drums and the electronic theramin. ED WOOD also echoes earlier Tim Burton characters from Scissorhands a character unable to physically connect with people because of his 'design flaw' to NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas' Jack Skellington a goodnatured graceful living skeleton who attempts to play Santa Claus easily my favorite holiday film. The tale of the misunderstood misfit who attempts to achieve something utterly beyond his grasp be it physical closeness Christmas magic or in Wood's case making decent films. ED WOOD is the perfect distillation of this theme. Failure after failure the boyishly optimistic Wood keeps pulling himself up time and time again undeterred by his overpowering limitations. Tim Burton with all the skill and natural talent at this phase of his career anyway his subject so desperately lacked tells this story as a personal humorous and ultimately loving tribute to all those who continually strive to achieve that which is beyond their reach. From that strife in murky water with malfunctioning prop octopuses is where the story of ED WOOD lives.".

The ones that stick out for me are the ones with Landau at his house and filming his one scene from Plan 9 From Outer Space but the ones with him on his 'sets' filming such drek with the passion and ambition of the greats is really refreshing to see. Ed Wood is quite the biopic showcasing Burton in another maturer form outside of films like Pee Wee and Batman but with the same knack for entertainment. After all how can you dislike a film with Tor Johnson Elvira and Bill Murray desiring a sexchange operation?".

Imagine yourself dedicated to your craft day after day and year after year putting out what you consider to be your best work in a field that you love only to find at the end of your life that you have failed in every way measurable and imaginable. This is essentially the story of director Edward D. Wood Jr. 19241978 who was voted the worst director in the history of film in 1980 and as a result saw a renewed interest in his films that persists even today.Johnny Depp gives a great performance as Ed Wood as he was in the 1950's starting with his friendship with Bela Lugosi and ending with the premiere of his best remembered film Plan Nine from Outer Space and his elopement with Kathy who remained his wife for twenty years until his death. At this point in his life Ed's enthusiasm for his work is irrepressible. Fortunately the film ends before he descends into frustration alcoholism and a series of skin flicks in the 60's. The genuine friendship between Lugosi Martin Landau and Wood is one of the more touching parts of the film. The men settle into almost a fatherson relationship with a real mutual professional admiration. Lugosi supplies Ed with a star with which he can attract investors in his films and Wood supplies Lugosi with work and a reason to go on living. Landau's portrayal of Lugosi is phenomenal. At times you forget that you really are not watching Lugosi himself.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to believe 'Ed Wood' was released 15 years ago. It went on to my instant favorites list the first time I watched it and seems as fresh and brilliant now as it did way back when. It was an inspired idea for a Tim Burton film and it is about as close to perfection as a film from Hollywood can get. The casting is beyond criticism Howard Shore's musical score is one of his very best full of memorable moments and catchy tunes especially the opening credits with the bongos the costumes and makeup camera work the whole ball of wax is beautifully conceived and executed. The fx are great because they are just as seedy and ridiculous as Ed Wood's on when he filmed 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' paper plates as flying saucers school room teachers' desks for control consoles within the space ships stewardess uniform for the female E.T. rubber octopuses etc. It is all very funny. Ed Wood's cross dressing does not come off as eyerolling ridiculous it too is very funny. Ed played by the everwonderful Johnny Depp is a fundamentally kind man full of ambitions and drive to succeed against horrendous odds his biggest obstacle being his own lack of talent. But now he is a Hollywood immortal along with Vampira played by the marvelous Lisa Marie and of course Bela Legosi at the very trashedout end of his long career an astonishing moving and often hilarious performance by Martin Landau.Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones add to the extremely funny cast of main characters. Patricia Arquette and Sarah Jessica Parker are Ed's two girlfriends Arquette playing his eventual wife Kathy a lovely performance the one quiet and relatively sane person in the entire movie.This is not just a very sophisticated adult comedy it is also recommendable to kids who are old enough to have developed a sense of humor though the cross dressing angle may cause some parents to give pause before allowing their 12 year old boys watch it. And the drugrehab scene with Bela Lugosi is intense but perhaps a good object lesson for youngsters who may be thinking shooting up heroin might be cool.I think 'Ed Wood' is Burton's best movie so far.".

	schema:headline " If you didn't laugh about it you'd cry  so Burton wisely takes the route of weirdly dark comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Ed Wood is a frustrated actor and director who's small theatre productions barely can get a good word said about them.  When a cheap little production company advertises a project about sex change Wood jumps at the chance and uses his personal fetish for women's clothing as the hook to get the job. Despite his final project being laughed out of the major studios Wood now has the taste for it and starts to try and get funding to make his own films  aided by the ailing star Bela Lugosi who is desperate for work to help fund his habits.  With a collection of freaks and oddballs Wood made what are now considered to be some of the worst films ever made.Some things in life are depressing and it is often the case that we try to look on the bright side and make jokes about the situation as an attempt to deal with it.  I'm from Northern Ireland and my humour is quite dark and gallows style simply because that is the kind of comedy I grew up with was draw from the background of murder and violence  gallows humour is an appropriate term.  This film may not be based on gallows humour but it is such a potentially depressing story that the only way to do it and make it enjoyable is to tell it with humour.  Burton treats his subject with a great deal of affection and thus makes this film a funny tale of a dreamer who we know will never see his dreams fulfilled in the way he would like.  The story is funny but not in the cruel mocking way that it could have been but in a fanciful way that is amusing and all the better for being based on truth.  This strand continues all the way through the film and helps us to like Wood even if it is impossible to defend his films  the ending is perfectly upbeat considering that Wood then ended his life an alcoholic making cheap nude pictures.  The characters are exaggerated but still quite true to the real life people they represent I take this from comments made in documentaries.As director Burton is excellent.  He gives the whole film an otherworldly feel that is very fitting for a tale that involves characters that are very weird indeed.  The affectionate approach that Burton has for Wood really helps  I wonder does he relate to the guy just trying to make the films that appeal to him or what it is that makes him feel this way towards him? Either way the end result is very good and it stands out as a film that is pretty much without flaw.  I questioned the film's inclusion in the imdb top 250 but then I thought well what is wrong with it? I had to admit that almost nothing is wrong  the only thing would be that the story may not be to everyone's tastes and not everyone will buy into Burton's affectionate look at Wood.The cast is led by a magnificent performance by Depp who I have long maintained is one of the finest actors or at least bravest of my generation.  Here he continues Burton's affectionate approach by portraying Wood as a man filled with hope and dreams  even doing a good job of turning cross dressing into an amusing quirk.  The cast is truly all star but they all do a great job playing their characters.  Landau's Oscar may have had a touch of sentimentality about it but it was still deserved  he plays Lugosi really well and manages the difficulties of his drug addiction really well to make him both amusing but deeply sympathetic.  The support cast includes good turns from Parker Arquette quite interchangeable really! Jones Murray Starr D'Onofrio and Spradlin.  All the cast do well but it is those that play Wood's wooden cast members that do the best job  managing to do both natural performances outside of Wood's movie but also doing justice to just how bad their characters really were!Overall this is a great movie but the tale of a rubbish movie director who enjoys crossdressing and hangs out with a group of weirdoes is likely not to be to everyone's taste.  Regardless of this if it interests you then you should be pleased with a slick movie that takes an amusing and affectionate look at what is a fairly depressing story.".

According to my present understanding this film was one of the first erotic films to be released in the new High Tech DVD Video LaserDisc format.  The film is very impressive with lots of artsy stuff and highfashion models as well as quality erotic settings and goingson  everything about this film is firstclass including the hifi stereo background music.

It rather remains a sole achievement a still unattainable paragon of the genre however I should mention that I am not familiar with other Philip Mond's endeavors .The movie's biggest accomplishment is the way in which it approaches the most critical problem of porn movies  a 'meaning' thing. The total absence of any sense even on some atmospheric level which characterizes almost all productions of this genre renders almost immaterial any other 'developments'. The attempts to deal with this problem some of them were pretty expensive have one common mistake  they tend to ignore the objective parameters set by the genre you have only 20 min between 'action' scenes at most to tell a 'story' this 'story' should live through these scenes which last much longer etc.. As a result in almost all those movies that undertook somewhat ponderous attempts to bring in some 'meaning' through introducing some 'plot' the latter exists separately from everything else. Conquest with Jenna Jameson is a good example  the plot does not affect the 'action' scenes in any way  in fact most of them are worse than those from any average quality production. So what we have is just a silly waste of time and money. Having obviously grasped the same idea  you can successfully handle this problem only by incorporating somehow a 'meaning' into an 'action'  Zazel on the contrary finds a perfect solution. It offers a plot chaste as it is but which immaculately pulls this whole thing together. Without any dialog the only thing that we can hear is a narration it renders meaningful not only all the 'action' scenes but each element of them settings costumes etc.Apart from this accomplishment the movie has two indisputable assets a marvelous soundtrack by Dino and Earl Ninn it contributes into the general meaning with its every instrumental part as well as with occasional lyrics and a piece of stunning perfection  the red beauty Anna Romeo. This graciously moving grayeyed honey has three scenes in the movie plus one as a body double and is absolutely dazzling in all possible ways.All those things compounded give us something that goes far beyond subjects that are commonly considered the pinnacles of the genre  normally gorgeously looking but in fact pretty tedious and senseless Andrew Blake's average fumbling around for instance. Something that even in strictly cinematic terms considering the amount of resources used is way above a good half of conventional Hollywood mainstream. It's the quintessence of the genre  an exquisite visual meditation on pure beauty of pure form. When you are watching it at times it feels like the world might make some sense.".

Dutch picture snapper Philip Mond was known and revered by connoisseurs of carnality for the much needed shot in the arm his idiosyncratic visuals had provided for then somewhat dwindling Penthouse magazine in the early '90s. Their mutually beneficial cooperation begot Mond's first movie selfexplanatory titled SEX OFF THE RUNWAY one of Bob Guccione's groin child's infrequent stabs at cornering the explicit erotic entertainment market and a virtual dry run for Mond's subsequent masterpiece. The no brainer winner of AVN's Best All Sex Film prize for 1997  along with additional compensations for the director's awesome camera gyrations art direction and famed fornication filmmaker in his own right James Avalon's exquisite editing  ZAZEL took the industry by storm with its flurry of Penthouse Pets noblesse oblige ! featured in invariably startling not to mention subtly kinky sexual scenarios.As a matter of fact if there's anything predictable or pedestrian about the movie it must be the unifying premise tying together its out of left field flights of fancy. Tortured artiste Zazel portrayed by ravishing raventressed Sasha Vinni who had also decorated Mond's virgin cinematic effort has to come up with an innovative ad campaign for a new perfume and looks towards nature as well as iconography both religious and pagan for inspiration. Breathless voice over blubbering portentous purple prose that sounds profound but means squat aside that's it as far anything resembling a proper plot's concerned but the images will absolutely take your breath away. Vinni emerges from a crystal pool painted bright blue and wearing a gold turban as a Hindu love goddess slowly seducing blond busty Grace Harlow. Former Vivid contract star Len Hefner who proved herself a decent actress under the tutelage of Paul Thomas in movies like MASK and CONTROL sensually submits to the probing caresses of tattoo artist Devin Wolf Jenna Jameson's boyfriend from Brad Armstrong's wonderful DREAM QUEST in a tantalizing tribute to Japanese classic IREZUMI. The tiger and orchid body painting interludes provide a stunning trompe l'oeil which literally means  to deceive the eye effect that viewers will never forget.With ANGELS  DEMONS raking it in at the box office as I write this Mond provides his personal interpretation of both. The sepiasaturated cherub climax is something to behold as it answers the age old theology conundrum whether angels possess genitals or not. Guess what ? They do even if they're not their own as Anna Romero and Kevin James stunt doubled for the penetration parts as Antonio Valentino proved unable unwilling or probably just uninvited to sully Sapphic sirens Vinni Helena and Brooke Lane who displayed no such qualms in Michael Ninn's FOREVER NIGHT and SHAYLA'S WEB. Ironically this heavily doctored tableau went on to win AVN's Best Group Sex Scene award thereby unwittingly scoring another triumph for its behind the scenes technical prowess. Romero returns to chew up the scenery among other things as a scarlet devil woman beheading Sasha and employing her severed noggin for oral gratification ! Still my personal choice for best of show would be the black and white coupling of Gina LaMarca and Jon Severini which really does look like some pretentious perfume ad with the added appeal of the pervasive passion these real life lovers so obviously share. For those of you like me enamored of this delectable duo they supplied a very modest repeat performance in Armstrong's palatable BREEDERS prior to calling it quits on the porno front.Mere words can't do justice to the sheer level of perfection Mond and his tremendously talented collaborators bring to each aspect of production all to glorify the beauty of its ladies to the hilt. Yet rather than with Andrew Blake to whose increasingly tepid universe we forcibly return through continuous critic comparison these women explore their innate earth mother wantonness rather than stand around looking bored amid designer interiors ! Coloring each sequence with an appropriate musical tone the amazingly eclectic Dino and Earl Ninn formerly Double Vision but settling on their current monikers courtesy of their fruitful association with fine filmmaker Michael still manage to outdo themselves impressive track record notwithstanding. Reeling from both actual achievement and awesome audience response Mond took a full decade to return to movies with the astonishing INSEXTS and the Club Jenna blockbuster SINEMA.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Penthouse filled movie is definitively among the best movies in those 200 reviews because it has everything an adult movie needs and at such high level you left it totally enthralled and exhausted ! First it has a story or as it seems the rule in that domain it has at least an original thread that links all the vignettes  the design of a the perfume that will offer the scent of love  so it's about sketching in a mansion and going into the garden to try the natural flavors. For sure every coming idea leads to an erotic fantasy. Next it has a wonderful and enchanting scenery  it explodes of colors of seasons of setting indoors outdoors and each time the score fits wonderfully  it's not some irritating jazz or piano but rather traditional worldwide folklore and sometimes sounds like religious music ! At least it has a unbelievable cast full of Penthouse Pets which is the proof that this was indeed the magazine of reference in that field  the buxom blonde Grace Harlow the wild curvy Nikkie St. Gilles are just amazing but when you add the first role with Sasha Vinni you reach the firmament  she is a stunning natural brunette with magnetic eyes and strong tongue and she gives an extraordinary performance really carrying the whole movie on herself as she is almost in every scene ! So this movie goes where all the Andrew Blake Micheal Ninn and others fails  it's poetic outrageous and really exciting ! For sure as it's so good there isn't another like this one so taste it again and again".

	onyx:emotionText "This Penthouse filled movie is definitively among the best movies in those 200 reviews because it has everything an adult movie needs and at such high level you left it totally enthralled and exhausted ! First it has a story or as it seems the rule in that domain it has at least an original thread that links all the vignettes  the design of a the perfume that will offer the scent of love  so it's about sketching in a mansion and going into the garden to try the natural flavors. For sure every coming idea leads to an erotic fantasy. Next it has a wonderful and enchanting scenery  it explodes of colors of seasons of setting indoors outdoors and each time the score fits wonderfully  it's not some irritating jazz or piano but rather traditional worldwide folklore and sometimes sounds like religious music ! At least it has a unbelievable cast full of Penthouse Pets which is the proof that this was indeed the magazine of reference in that field  the buxom blonde Grace Harlow the wild curvy Nikkie St. Gilles are just amazing but when you add the first role with Sasha Vinni you reach the firmament  she is a stunning natural brunette with magnetic eyes and strong tongue and she gives an extraordinary performance really carrying the whole movie on herself as she is almost in every scene ! So this movie goes where all the Andrew Blake Micheal Ninn and others fails  it's poetic outrageous and really exciting ! For sure as it's so good there isn't another like this one so taste it again and again";

	schema:reviewBody "I remember reading through Satyajit Ray's list of things that people from outside India would fail to get in Charulata  of all his films up to 1980 anyway the one he thought was most superficially accessible to Westerners  and thinking to myself But I DID get all this... at least more or less.In Bengal society Ray writes a woman's brotherinlaw holds a privileged position the two are EXPECTED to form a special friendship and she is allowed to be more intimate with him than with anyone else to whom she's not related by blood apart of course from her husband. Ray is right. Most Westerners don't know this. I certainly didn't. But we're able to infer as much of it as matters from the film itself we can tell that Amal and Charulata expect before they fall properly in love a fair degree of freedom in negotiating their friendship that this is okay by Bhupati that this isn't considered odd by any of the participants that it probably WOULD be considered odd were Amal an outsider... and we can tell a good deal more besides this is as everyone acknowledges a film of exceedingly rich characterisations. What we CAN'T tell from the film alone is the extent to which the expectations and roles of the three central characters are duplicated in other marriages across India. But this doesn't matter. This is a chamber drama not an allegory.Ray also lists some literary allusions which Westerners are almost certain to be blind to but again I think he's underestimated the extent to which he gets across in the film alone all he needs to get across. We can tell from the way the characters react what the allusions mean just as an allusion to Achilles' heel if properly used will make sense to and add depth for an audience entirely unfamiliar with Greek legend. Even the film's makes sense to outsiders in a way Ray thinks it won't. It's a Scottish tune I know this because I recognised it but you can tell it's Scottish even if you don't with Bengali lyrics we can tell it's a Western song from more or less the land which currently rules over India which at least some Indians have adopted as their own which is popular enough for Amal to expect others to be familiar with it etc. I have to admit though that something was being conveyed by the lyrics that wasn't being adequately conveyed by the subtitles.It's a tribute to Ray's skill that even he doesn't realise just how much context he's managed to import into Charulata. Of course he's right in that nobody will get everything Ray himself admits to not understanding the meaning of his own hopeful? cautious? distancing? final freeze frame I only knew that it was the right way to end the film and I need hardly add I don't either.Ray was wrong to think that the allusions fall flat on Western ears or that some of the necessary social context is impenetrable but the film would still have something to offer even if he weren't the characters would still be as alive and real the respect with which they're treated would be just as apparent the film would still in short be a beautiful one.".

What starts off as innocent flirting with her brotherinlaw soon sets off emotions that none of them decent though they all are can really control. There is no adultery as such  the betrayal is all in the mind  but the trust implicit in marriage is broken and the future can only be faced with uncertainty.This is a film of great grace and elegance and also of considerable wit. But underneath the surface charm is a great seriousness. As always Ray depicts the development of the  characters with great insight and sensitivity and coaxes fine performances from his cast. Western critics in discussing this film often draw parallels with the works of Chekhov or of Henry James but Ray's inspiration was actually the great Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore on whose short novel this film was based.

In a handful of scenes a French new wave influence can also be seen  primarily at the very end and also in an earlier scene featuring the title character's recollections in a quickmoving montage of childhood memories.

Charulata  as an attractive upperclass wife is essentially expected to manage the household and not much else and is increasingly both lonesome Bhupati is a generally pleasant enough husband though also a severe workaholic who is rarely around and  in his sexual politics  he is a product of his time and intellectually restless.

I saw Charulata The Lonely Wife on videotape in the closing days of 1999.Charulata clearly espouses S.Ray's distinctive style with very strong and realistic characters subtly developed rich immersion into the period of the film in this case around the time of the Indian Mutiny in the 1860s or 1870s as I recall from history having of a very few settings that are each portrayed in detail and compelling and introspective camera shots.  I am not surprised that some people are reminded in viewing S. Ray's films of Russian author Chekhov I think of the paralysis of the characters in The Cherry Orchard and their juxtaposition against a lovely estate that they are in the process of losing.In this film there isn't the same faded glory but the lovely home decor and liberating gardens do contrast starkly with the paralysis of the wife.  Bright and with clear literary talent she is stuck as but a home fixture for her wellintentioned but unseeing husband.  The husband has laudable passion for his newspaper and the truth but is sadly ignorant of the companionship and time that any relationship particularly a marital one demands.I would probably rate this film 8.59 out of 10.  For me it didn't have the strong emotion of any of the other films I mentioned above or the intricate story of Agantuk The Stranger in color and which I believe was his last film.  But overall Charulata is another masterpiece film by Satyajit Ray with a quiet and humble yet powerful presentation rather uncommon in contemporary film.".

	schema:headline " A subtle feminist perspective on love and work";
	schema:reviewBody "Charulata displays a subtle story about the contradictions facing a cultivated and intelligent  yet idle  woman in a maledominated society. Charulata's husband is a very rich man a liberal intellectual and the editor of a journal The Sentinel dedicated to the propagation of the truth. Unfortunately the husband though an honest man and an idealist fails to give enough attention to his wife Charulata. The latter is interested in romantic Bengali literature not politics. Her intellectual perspective thus clashes with that of her husband who looks down on literature and in particular on that literature which relates to love.Through a unique understated sentimental experience which forms the core of the movie Charulata reveals to herself and her husband a power to act on the world. After a series of difficulties that affect her husband's newspaper and her own sentimental self Charulata finally takes a step forward and proposes to collaborate with her husband. However the director makes us doubt that love and work can be reconciled by referring to the title of the Tagore literary work the movie is adapted from the broken nest.Contrary to what my comments above may suggest this is NOT a movie with a heavy and obvious political message. The cinematographic style is thus often reminiscent of Jean Renoir's Une Partie de Campagne with in particular the use of a swing. The movie has little dialogue and uses the subtlety of symbols and the actors' facial expressions to convey what the characters go through. The characters are the center of the story as individuals not archetypes but it is because they are so credible and complex as individuals that they can make us think about universal questions.".

	schema:headline " The Magic of Satyajit Ray";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the first film of Satyajit Ray that I have seen and probably one of the first if not the first nonwesternized Indian films. Most of my previous viewings like the wonderful Monsoon Wedding by Mira Nair were made by directors who live and created in Hollywood. This wonderful film made in 1964 is even more a revelation as its director is a master contemporary and at the same level as the best directors of his generation.The setting of the story is in Calcutta's high society of the end of the 19th century in a period of social and national conflict that is all the time on the background but is not really the center of the story. Based on a story by Rabindranath Tagore almost all the conflict happens in the house of the wealthy journalist and newspaper owner Bupathi which is filmed with refinement in all its details by the master camera of Subrata Mitra. My feeling after the first scenes was that I am watching a play by Ibsen or Chekhov transplanted in a different continent and this feeling was induced not only by the one set staging but also or especially by the strong character of the principal character Bupathi's beautiful wife Charulata. We immediately feel her loneliness her need to connect with people her emotional capacity which he represses by watching the human landscape of the street. When Buphati will being his younger brother Amal in the house the two will become involved in a never consumed forbidden relationship that is intense and discreet. As proving or acting openly according to sentiments is not part of the culture the characters belong to Charulata will prove her sentiments by demonstrating her creative and intellectual qualities in a world and a time dominated by men. The ending may look like a melodrama but it's perfectly plausible.Charulata is acted by Madhabi Mukherjee in a flawless and sensible performance that reminds Yasujiro Ozu's preferred actress Setsuko Hara. It is not however the only aspect that reminded me the Japanese master. The vibration of nature in 'Charulata' complements and amplifies the feelings of the heroes same as in Ozu's movies. The reliance on actors to describe feelings to the most subtle of the nuances the delicacy and dignity of the relations the quite storytelling and the control of story time seem all to belong to the same school of cinema that puts actors and camera work in the center of the art of film making. Ray's cinema has more of a social and historical context though at least in this film. There is also a key difference in the camera work approach. While both directors control the art of framing and build beautiful and memorable scenes there is much more dynamics in Ray's camera movement with daring shots that represent much more the characters view of the world than the director's view as at Ozu.'Charulata' was for me one of these revelations of a new world that happens once in a awhile in the life of a cinema lover. One more proof that good cinema transcends genres and film schools and succeeds at best when it talks directly to the hearts of the viewers.".

The film is definitely slow paced but it certainly kept me interested every minute.

	schema:reviewBody "Satyajit Ray's Charulata 1964 is considered to be a masterpiece and monument of timeless art and is also accepted as one of the best ever adaptations of a literary piece. The film is an adaptation of a short story named Nashtaneer by Rabindranath Tagore. This review contains Ray's subtle use of metaphors while handling the plot which deserves appreciation along with its other technical perfections.The metaphors used in this film are countable but very much catchy and pleasant if related properly with each other. Ray successfully employed the metaphors within the constraint of film techniques. The mentionable metaphors are Charu's operaglass caged birds carpetshoe and Sentinel newspaper etc. In the very poetic opening sequence of the film is not bereft of any intention by the director. The use of operaglass vision or binocularvision which is maskedshot to be precise is very grabbing. Charu sees the world through operaglass. Even she sees her husband Bhupati with it once. The immediate and swift zoomout after the gaze is praiseworthy. In the film Charu sees the world through it but whoever she sees goes out of her limited vision. She cannot but forced to let them go out of her vision. By the end of the film she once again takes refuge to her glasses. The focus of her glasses a boat moves on. The only person static in her operaglass is Amal as seen in the garden sequence. But Amal sneaks off at last rendering Charu's operaglass a constant metaphor of both escapism and a means of escape. Two times in the film caged birds are seen within the frame of a shot's composition. That is a perfect metaphor for representing Charu and Amal to some extent as if they can fly but within a limited confinement where flying does not even mean anything fruitful. The carpetshoe metaphor is a perfect example of Charu's growing weakness for Amal. Charu knitted the pair of shoe with meticulous attention for Bhupati. This was a sign of her loyalty to her husband. But she presents it to Amal and it was clear that she was presenting her affinity for Amal by doing this. When Amal leaves she angrily collects the pair of shoe from Amal's room but there is no indication that she will give it to Bhupati either. The metaphoric indication is clear  Charu can never present her love to anyone anymore. The Sentinel newspaper is last but not the least metaphor here. It shifts its representational position which makes it an interesting metaphor. At first it was a symbol of Bhupati's workaholic mind and was appreciable. Then it turns itself as an image of political consciousness of Bhupati and thus assumes a negative connotation to the viewer. It is because Bhupati's obsession with politics fruits a chasm in a social relationship between him and his wife Charu. Then the newspaper becomes a symbol of Bhupati's failure. At the last freeze shot a copy of the newspaper is seen which connotes itself to be nothing more than a scrap and thus a metonymy of a broken house. Among other metaphors betel and Bishwabondhu magazine are prominent ones.It is literally very tough to find flaws with editing of such a meticulously knitted film. In fact there is none to be mentioned. The transition between scenes is smoothed by very charming fadeins and fadeouts. There are cuts but torrent of the plot remains uninterrupted. It must be mentioned that superimposition used in order to ensure the transition between scenes were very successful. The most interesting was the last three freezes. It is at once appreciable and bears evidence of cinematic craftsmanship of Satyajit Ray. He was accused by a critic that Charulata has been a bad adaptation. But within the technical sophistication of a film the necessity of deducing adding and altering is technically and literally undeniable. Thus the subtlety of editing makes Charulata one of the most entertaining and pioneering films in Bengali of all times. The editing aids to condense the story within an accepted time frame. In a nutshell the crafty editing makes Charulata even critics' favourite as well.".

No one says what they think or want it's all implied in the action. The cinematography is superb. There's a memorable scene where Charulata is swinging gracefully under a huge shady tree singing a Bengali version of Ye Banks and Braes of Bonnie Doon  so incongruous in Calcutta but beautifully capturing the way the family was at the cutting edge of the cultural collision between traditional Bengali values and the new world of their British rulers  while Amal the younger brotherinlaw who pays her the attention her husband doesn't is lounging on the grass reading dappled in sunlight. Love is everywhere yet not a word is said. The story is based on Rabindranath Tagore's novella Nashta Nir The Bird's Nest which in turn is based on real life a tragic event in Rabindranath's life. His elder brother Jyotindranath a playwright painter and failed businessman found too little time for his wife Kadambari who was Rabindranath's age childless and infatuated with literature  a very unusual combination for a Bengali woman in that age. The Tagore women were pioneers they showed themselves in public loved the arts one was the first woman to ride a horse on Calcutta's Maidan its inner city park another the first Bengali Hindu to wear a blouse under her sari. The young Rabindranath was Kadambari's companion and she his Muse to whom he dedicated his early books. How far it went is not clear but eventually his father married Rabindranath off to a child bride and a few months later Kadambari committed suicide.".

	onyx:emotionText "The best Satyajit Ray movie.  Ray at his peak gave us his most convincing insight into love and loyalty two of his universal themes. Unfortunately the brilliant Apu trilogy has more of an visceral draw to Western audiences and Charulata is overlooked.  The Apu trilogy invokes the idea of the Western view of India right or wrong while Charulata almost represents an anomaly of upperclass Indians in the late Victorian era.Charulata actually is a better film that any of those in the Apu trilogy as hard as that is to believe not to mention the most visually striking. However the one thing Apu trilogy has over Charulata is its freshness. But this almost the same situation as Martin Scorsese and Mean Streets and Taxi Driver.  This is not to say that he didn't make any good movies after that. Goodfellas is perhaps his best.In the end Ray had style as well as substance in many of his films and Charulata represents that pinnacle while the Apu trilogy establishes what was to come.";

	schema:reviewBody "Recently I received some very nice emails from someone who appreciated my reviews there's at least one! and they recommended I look into the films of Satyajit Rayparticularly The Big City and The Lonely Wife. I am happy I listened as I really liked both filmsparticularly The Big City. The best thing about these films is their ordinarinesshow they are about everyday folks and the films are not glamorized or Hollywoodized in the least. The unfortunate thing however is that both are pretty lousy prints with relatively poor captionsand both appear to be directly copied from a videotape.Now what I saw in the film and what the summary says are not exactly the same. Perhaps this is due to a mistranslation or perhaps when the husband says 'brother' it's a diminutive term and the person he's saying it to is actually his cousin but I sure was under the impression that Amal was Bhapati's brother.Charlu is a lonely lady back in India in 1879. Her husband is the publisher of a newspaperso she lives in relative luxury but doesn't see enough of him as he's very busy. So Bhapati gets the idea to have his family come and live with them. The brotherinlaw seems like a good choice to move in with them as he says he wants to work on the paper and contribute. Amal however is a recent college graduate and is not at all interested in doing any workjust write. Quickly Amal and Charlu become friends as both of them have a common interestwriting. However this familiarity combined with Bhapati's absence spell disasteras does trusting the brotherinlaw with the paper's finances. There's more to the story than this but it's best you see it yourself and see it unfold.The acting writing and direction are very nicemostly because it seems awfully real. And if you like Neorealist films or stories by Majid Majidi then you should really like The Lonely Wife. Not great but very very good.".

	schema:headline " Women would probably better appreciate the realism in this movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Apart from the sophisticated acting and cinematography this film carries very deep social and moral messages which are not dumped on the viewer in a preachy manner. However Charulata has been criticised often to be slow in its pace. As a Bengali I have watched this movie multiple times while growing up and frankly I never understood the movie. In the age of Facebook and Twitter I used to think that there is hardly a relevance of a story set in 19th century Bengal. On the contrary I now find the movie highly thoughtful and deeply affecting. Certainly I get the historical context better and I am an adult with my own experiences in love and betrayal but there's something else. Charulata is by no means slow paced. Rather its pace aptly conveys the humdrum life of the title character  a lonely wife. I am not a woman but I believe that the refined feminist references in this film would be better interpreted by a woman critic. Whether or not you are aware of the impact of Bankim Chandra's literary works on Bangla society. Charulata is the interplay of inner feelings and insecurities that creep into our lives. Charulata is the realisation that no matter what our intentions may be our relationships are as fragile as a bird's nest and a strong wind can take it down easily. Although we may not hear the sound of a relationship breaking we know that things will never be the same. The original story on which this movie is based was by Rabindranath Tagore and conspicuously named 'NashtaNirh' Broken Nest. I think Tagore wrote the story with a slight autobiographical connotation where he identified himself as a young struggling writer Amal in the shadow of Bankim Chandra who was an established writer when Tagore was still unknown. Tagore's personal attachment towards his elder brother's wife and the very important role of his elder brother in his life also seem to echo through this story. Nonetheless the film beautifully captures the essences of Tagore's story and says more than one could possibly fathom in a single viewing.".

There is a humour and lightness of touch that is very refreshing. I particularly liked the contrast between the newspaper editor husband who clearly takes his work very seriously and the lack of fulfilment or focus in other people's lives around him. Acting cinematography lighting sound locations shot composition all are done so well and the story is accessible enough to make it enjoyable to any audience.

They have at this writing released Jalsaghar 1958 and Mahanagar 1963 in addition to this speaking of Bluray and have thrown in Kapurush 1965 as an extra on the latter and a DVD of later Ray. Not only this but Artificial Eye the European rightsholders have already released some more not available on Criterion yet Nayak 1966 and Mahapurush 1965.All I can remember from that magical first viewing is I fell in love. Not sure why or how but that the feeling was strong and as if mutual. And true enough Ray's cinema makes us learn about ourselves and others music and song writing and reading seeing and not seeing. As if I had seen myself not as I truly see myself but as I wish to have been seen or even further than that how I could have been seen.Ray frames many introductory shots through doorways. To lead us into her life? To observe the observer? To confine the confined? To hint at the escape? Ray has the one of a kind ability to make one feel present like one's really there nothing has to happen and it's spellbinding. By the way has the hypnotic first shot been taken by Jane Campion to her Bright Star 2009?Books are introduced in the very beginning as are the binoculars used by Charulata. Both motifs used in the sense of seeing afar yet not seeing close. And when they finally do they will discover themselves. The genius that he is Ray is able to show inner turmoil in nature's violence the wind just as he did in Jalsaghar. That moment of discovery is laden with great anxiety to bursts through so strongly one can feel it deep in the fibre one's being the longing the disappointment the reconciliation.".

We are jolted when they look into the camera and sing but because we have been already lulled into his world it feels completely natural that they would sing to us.

Based on Tagore's novella 'Nastanirh' which itself was based on Tagore's own attraction to his brother's wife 'Charulata' tells the tale of the growing attraction between a cousin Amal played by Soumitra Chatterjee who visits a newspaper publisher Shailen Mukherjee and the publisher's wife Charulata Madhabi Mukherjee. The pair are encouraged to spend time together by the publisher who loves his wife but is too busy with his job to spend time with her and the feelings they begin to have are subtle and begin with discussions of writing. There are some nice moments with Amal singing to Charulata as well as a fantastic scene with her swinging while he lays in the grass beside her. This is a subtle deft perfectly told story the betrayal is contained to emotions not physical acts and is more powerful as a result. All of the actors turn in excellent performances and Ray's direction is brilliant. The philosophical moments elevate the film ala Bergman and here are a couple of quotesI was thinking all of life is like a rhythm. Birthdeath. Daynight. Happinesssorrow. Meetingparting. Like the waves on the ocean now risingnow falling. One complements the other. Even as Prince Abhimanyu while still in the womb learned only how to penetrate enemy formations but not how to withdraw. So a river emerging from the mountain's rocky womb can only advance and knows not how to turn back. O river! O youth! O time! O world! You too can only march onward. You never turn back along the path strewn with memory's gilded pebbles. Only the mind of man looks back. The rest of creation never does.".

Amal matures and Charu is left heartbroken but the most superlative scene is when Bhupati understands the truth of their relationship.It is superlative scene played with nuance.The final scene is a utter celebration of cinematic celebration and is a rarity in Indian cinema.Charulata is the cameras ultimate triumph .Shots and sequences are itself a part of storytelling and have enhanced the conflicts manifold times.Hence this movie may or may not be Ray's best but it is surely the greatest celebration of Bengali culture";

Closeups are indeed imperative to this film. It's all about the repressed desires of the subjects of 19th century colonialized India and the most profound and intimate impulses of its characters are never stated but communicated through facial expressions. The acting in this respect is extraordinary especially from Madhabi Mukherjee who plays the title character a house wife of a workaholic husband who possesses an unexplored literary gift which is ignited by her attraction to her husband's poet cousin. The lighting is also exceptional. Ray and Mitra create motion pictures that look like the still photographs of the film's temporal setting. Shots that depict two characters highlight the longing and distance between the figures. Ray's use of still frames to semitell of moments of extreme intimacy feel all the more natural as a result of the lighting scheme.".

Between the two of them Nayak is more easy to understand whereas The Magician puts its characters in various shades of good and evil throughout its running time.No such dramatics here and this movie is as good as it gets. I would rate it as one of his best movies amongst Pather Panchali and Charulata. The dream sequences were very well produced and were relevant to the storyline on a subconscious level.The subtitling on the Angel DVD wasn't very well done and the dialogues sometimes whizz by without us being able to read them in time. For people who are familiar with Indian languages it may not be such a big deal since several of the Bengali words can be understood by them however for nonIndian speakers this may come across as irritating.On a personal note I am sometimes glad that not many people know about Ray because then I am able of recommending him to people who are in the know of the movie industry.".

	schema:headline " A true masterpiece by Satyajit";
	schema:reviewBody "A least seen movie of Satyajit. Satyajit is one of the very few great directors who worked outside Hollywood circle and gave a lot to the film history. He is mostly know to the movie lovers as the creator of great APU TRILOGY. I feel that Ray's works are severely underrepresented in USA although most of his works are masterpiece or nearmasterpiece. Thanks to Ishmael Marchent for arranging a retrospective on Ray's works at USA in 1996 I guess. But again in that retrospective I didn't see the names of some of his great works like NAYAK KUNCHENJUNGHA SEEMABADHYA ARANYER DIN RATRI or SONAR KELLA. Names of the films that I always see in a Satyajit Festival are the APU TRILOGY JALSHAGHAR CHARULATA GHAREBAIRE ... etc. No doubt that all of those are great works of Ray but indeed one cannot know the power of his filmmaking unless he sees some of his other less known works some of which I mentioned.Nayak is a simple story of the most popular Film Actor of India acted with all perfection by great Indian Actor Uttam Kumar who goes to the capital city Delhi to receive an award of his achievement via a train. On the train he meets Shormila Tagore Another favorite actress of Satyajit whom he casted in several other movies like Apur Sansar Devi Aranyer Din Ratri Seemabadhya ... etc. and some other characters of the story. The story progresses when Uttam discusses with different aspects of his life and career with others especially with Shormila. In depth thoughts and feelings of UTTAM sprung out as time goes by and Shormila discovers the very lonely man in Uttam  hidden behind his day to day charismatic lifestyle.On my judgement NAYAK is the greatest creation of RAY. UTTAM's acting can challenge anyone in the motion picture history. The high abstratness and philosophical bent of the movie is comparable to that of CITIZEN KANE according to me better than CITIZEN KANE and the mutual conversations among the characters or the screenplay in other words can beat those of MINDWALK VANYA ON 42nD STREET RED or CASABLANCA. A must see film for all great movie lovers. A 10 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "A least seen movie of Satyajit. Satyajit is one of the very few great directors who worked outside Hollywood circle and gave a lot to the film history. He is mostly know to the movie lovers as the creator of great APU TRILOGY. I feel that Ray's works are severely underrepresented in USA although most of his works are masterpiece or nearmasterpiece. Thanks to Ishmael Marchent for arranging a retrospective on Ray's works at USA in 1996 I guess. But again in that retrospective I didn't see the names of some of his great works like NAYAK KUNCHENJUNGHA SEEMABADHYA ARANYER DIN RATRI or SONAR KELLA. Names of the films that I always see in a Satyajit Festival are the APU TRILOGY JALSHAGHAR CHARULATA GHAREBAIRE ... etc. No doubt that all of those are great works of Ray but indeed one cannot know the power of his filmmaking unless he sees some of his other less known works some of which I mentioned.Nayak is a simple story of the most popular Film Actor of India acted with all perfection by great Indian Actor Uttam Kumar who goes to the capital city Delhi to receive an award of his achievement via a train. On the train he meets Shormila Tagore Another favorite actress of Satyajit whom he casted in several other movies like Apur Sansar Devi Aranyer Din Ratri Seemabadhya ... etc. and some other characters of the story. The story progresses when Uttam discusses with different aspects of his life and career with others especially with Shormila. In depth thoughts and feelings of UTTAM sprung out as time goes by and Shormila discovers the very lonely man in Uttam  hidden behind his day to day charismatic lifestyle.On my judgement NAYAK is the greatest creation of RAY. UTTAM's acting can challenge anyone in the motion picture history.

Makes you wonder why these two  the actor and director not get together more often in Satyajit Roy films. The angst was so real it seems the guy is not acting any more  just telling his story as it is. The dream sequencewas outstanding as was the ending. The characterisation had on occasion skirted around the burlesque with the older actor in his first interaction with the protagonist but that made the scene all the more poignant. The underlying philosophy is not too deep but something that one can deeply empathise with. The greatness of this movie is how perfectly the story is told. There is an aura of dramatic tension throughout not between the characters but within the protagonist himself. I would sincerely recommend this movie to anyone who loves what cinema is all about.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ray's 'Nayak' is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made in history of Indian cinema. The story about an actor Arnidam Mukherji who is hailed as some sort of a demigod in the country unfolds during a train journey and is told through several interesting narrative techniques  His life is presented in the form of a disjunctive montage several pieces of which he supplies himself  mainly through the candid interviews given to his copassenger a freelancing journalist and the archetypal modern woman Aditi and through his dreams which reveal his innermost fears and the ghosts of his past. To his fellow passengers and to most of his fans and audience he is a charming larger than life superstar and the twin reports of his receiving an award in Delhi and getting involved in a brawl in a club invite the same amount of speculation and curiosity from them. Arindam the superstar and Arindam the man with a conscience are constantly at conflict. His awareness of the superficiality of an actor's life clash with his concerns about the boxoffice and of becoming a forgotten hero  a fate bestowed upon many of the actors he had known personally. He desperately needs a person who will listen and in a drunken stupor he tries to tell Aditi the truth about the reported brawl and the deception of Promila his coactor and flame. Aditi doesn't want any explanations but she understands his turmoil  her prejudice against the brash cocky film star is formidably shaken as she glimpses the real man behind the actor  someone vulnerable broken and anguished who has become a puppet in the hands of the film industry and the public as he puts it. Life goes on as usual despite both Arindam and Aditi achieving a kind of epiphany during the train journey. The film for me is remarkable not just because of its story or symbols or technical finesse but because of the brilliant acting and dialogs. 'Nayak' if I'm not mistaken is Uttam Kumar's incidentally a huge superstar himself first ever film with Ray. The sensitivity with which he has portrayed the character almost makes us believe that this is really his own life story that is being played out before our eyes. One of the smartest and slickest Ray films ever this one gets a 10 from me. A must watch.".

The story was supposedly written keeping his struggle to stardom and the tolls of stardom in mind. Perhaps one of the most important reasons that Uttam performed so well was that he could probably identify himself in the role. Once again coming to the scripts written by the maestro Satyajit Ray himself was simply superb.

Satyajit rightly chose one and only Uttam as the 'Nayak'.Undoubtedly Uttamwhose movies are intimately woven to every bengali's life even after 24 years of his death is the alltime silver screen idol of all generations of Bengali film lovers. Though Uttam didn't get the much blessings of the classy directors compared to his arch rival Soumitra this is one of the few occassions where Uttam got the chance to prove his acting skill and explioted to the fullest extent.The story starts when there are two news regarding Arindam played by uttam published in the news papers  one is the fighting in a night club and the other that he has been nominated for a prestigeus award. In a train journey to delhi he reveals himself to a lady reporter played by Sharmila. It was a self digging in a form of informal interview.

	schema:reviewBody "This early film by the Great Master Satyajit Ray Ray should be pronounced 'rye' by the way which few people seem to realize has the original title of NAYAK and was also released as NAYAK THE HERO. It has recently been released by Artificial Eye as a BlueRay in high definition clearly made from the negative and the film is as crisp as new without any scratches or faults at all. Most of the action of the film set in the late 1950s or early 60s takes place in the first class carriages of the Calcutta to Delhi Express train. This film takes its place in the pantheon of great train films alongside Jerzy Kawalwerowicz's NIGHT TRAIN POCIAK 1959 see my review and Josef von Sternberg's SHANGHAI EXPRESS 1932. The first few minutes of the initial scenes in the film do not at all suggest the fascination of what is to come so impatient people need to rest easy until the real action commences. Once everyone is on the train and the long overnight journey commences Ray's mastery of pace and style creates another of his masterpieces with seemingly effortless ease. The subtlety and sophistication of the film is truly astonishing. But then Ray always takes one's breath away. This is one of the few Ray films I had never seen before. It features an exquisite and restrained performance by Sharmila Tagore distant relative of Rabindranath Tagore who had made her screen debut with Ray in his masterpiece THE WORLD OF APU 1959 seven years earlier and appeared in other Ray films later on. The lead role is brilliantly played by Uttam Kumar 19261980 dying young at only 53 but after appearing in an astonishing 157 films. As a troubled young movie star of vacuous popular films he knows that he has betrayed his inner self for money and fame and he pours his heart out on the train to Sharmila Tagore. His good looks contorted into such earnest thoughtful expressions reminded me so much of Lawrence Harvey towards the end of his life. Many characters are on the train and their parallel stories run alongside the main one of Kumar's who is known as 'the hero' in his films and give this film its title. The casting is superb as usual the directorial magic of Ray casts its usual spell upon the viewer and we are lost in this moving world of the train and its stories a transcendental caravan making its way across the Indian landscape 'it is harder and dryer now that we have crossed the border of Bengal' 'you are harder and dryer too' in a kind of dream. Kumar has dreams on the train which are excellently filmed and the train journey itself becomes one as well. Ray's films were all made in the Bengali language which is incomprehensible to the inhabitants of other parts of India so that Ray is surprisingly unknown to India as a whole. Most Indians are wholly lost in the makebelieve world of 'Bollywood' musicals and have no interest whatsoever in serious or meaningful films. I have never met any Indian from the west of India who has ever seen a Ray film. They would have to have subtitles and would find Ray's films too thoughtful and would consider them unentertaining. This is a great pity because Ray was an artist of international stature and for some decades his portrayals of Indian life and culture experienced worldwide success and acclaim and gave India a huge cultural reputation. India should pay more attention to him. But we also must keep reviving and studying his masterpieces the most famous of which are of course THE APU TRILOGY though my own personal favourite apart from that wonderful trilogy is THE MUSIC ROOM 1958 a mesmerising film about a man obsessed with music which is almost forgotten today. This film THE HERO has much to say and it achieves some profound insights into human character and motivations. It is also spellbinding in its quiet peeling away of the layers of conceit and deceit in our human affairs.".

	schema:headline "  Yet another analysis for Nayak  Bengali film  1966";
	schema:reviewBody " Imagine a moonlight sky where you have all the riches of the world but no one besides you to share the moment. The moment of sheer romance is lost into an instant disarray of loneliness. Does success always come with a price and if yes are we all ready for it? Ray's quest into screenplay took the form of a film post Kanchanjunga where he wrote the script for Nayak a story about an ace film stara matine scorer and his maiden cross country journey in a train towards Delhi to receive the National award. This train journey is a bit different for Arindam Uttam Kumar who faces the first rare chance of a flop in his career and worse a page three report related to a women faced brawl involving him. The film uses flashback as Arindam gives interview to a fellow amateur reporter Aditi Sharmila Tagore and before Arindam realizes he is lost in a journey of sympathy confession and guilt. Ray was a prominent critic for the 70's and maybe he wanted to show what commercial films has given and what it has taken away. Ray uses the early days of Arindam to narrate his relationships to theatre world especially with his mentor Shankarda. Arindam being the backbone of Shankarda's acting theatre was lured into commercial film offer which caused his theatre business to fail and hence a sudden death for Shankarda. Arindam flashes back even further as he enjoys the company of Aditi into his first commercial film as he recollects his role where he was bullied by a senior actor Mukunda Lahiri who seemed old fashioned for Arindam and often Mukunda's rebuke frustrated and ultimately pulled Arindam to an avenge for Muknda Lahiri much later in his life. Arindam also narrates about his college friend Brijesh who took up active politics and once tried to use the star status of Arindam to motivate the striking workers at a factory which Arindam refused as today he is successful and college adventures donot suit him. Arindam today cannot sleep his success can not buy him a rest. His riches is of no use as he gets more frustrated playing the same glamour role and often thinks what would happen if his next three film flops. He starts to share a jovial relation with Aditi as the journey progresses but his own gulit and a sense of justice makes him contemplate suicide. But Aditi influences him here and again as the train halts at Delhi Arindam is lost as the super star among his fans where there is no room for guilt nor justice. Its sheer stardom and maybe Arindam has to carry it for the rest of his life. Few aspects of the film which stands apart are 1. Devi Chaudhurani  Arindam first film was Devi Chaudhurani and Ray loved this character. Ray did have aspirations of filming Devi Chaudhurani which never worked as rumors reports Suchitra sen turned him down at the peak of her successful career. 2. Sub plots  Ray uses lots of secondary characters with sheer perfections to tell the story of his pasts. ShankardaMukunda and his lost friend Brijesh 3. Parallel plot  The plot of a businessman using his wife to make a deal is in back drop which Ray uses to show that even society is unfair not only commercial films 4. Journey  Ray loved to portray travel and he repeats this in Nayak. Other journey related films are Abhijaan Sonar Kella and Aranya din ratri. Ray spills the beans in his later film via the characters in Aguntuk and refers this to the famous German word  Wonderlust. Ray was a Sindbad in his own rights. 5. Aditi  Ray beautifully portrays the character of a critic for Arindam who gives up her interview notes  in a way to save Arindam for further trauma 6. Dream sequence  Film experts regards this as best dream sequence where Shankarda never saves a dying Arindam in between a sea bed of bank notes 7. Films donot change society  The film ends where all character return back to status quo. The journey donot change them. Arindam returns to the glamour world Aditi tears off her interview and gives up the spook of Arindam Finally during my research for Nayak I found a wonderful line with which I would end my review  Not to have seen the cinema of Satyajit Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon. Akira Kurosawa".

There is no doubt that he made a correct decision. Uttamkumar's acting in the role of 'NAYAK' is fantabulous. This movie is about the ups and downs in the life of a successful film star. He revealed his story to a journalistSharmila Tagore when he was boarded on a train. Alongside Ray created other characters which were also very significant and lie in perfect harmony with the main course. He pictured every character with some unique qualities and sometimes made a mockery of the modern lifestyle and intellectualism of upper middle class. The character of AditiSharmila Tagore is very soothing. She never compromised on her righteousness. And that's why she tore off the paper of interview at last because it was never gonna give her any satisfaction. A masterpiece. A world classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am slowly but surely beginning to discover the works of a master auteur whom I had know so little about but whose great seminal works have emerged in my minds eye like a rosebud revealing itself from the winter sleep. 'Nayak The Hero' AKA 'O Heri' is a brilliant look into the world of filmmaking acting stardom materialism and image worship which Bengali legend Satyajit Ray's allencompassing approach masterfully constructs. His approach weaves a multilayered narrative around a film star on route to the capital of India Delhi to collect an award and through his interactions with fellow passengers on the train surreal dreams and recollections remind him of the futility of idolisation and image worship both immediately the cult of celebrity but also more expansively the cult of capitalism. As I am fast discovering these sociological progressive leftist ideas are intrinsic to Ray's works and a particular trait of his is the subtle use of motifs incidental moments and dialogue that helps to convey these ideas. A particular scene where a passenger orders Coke emphasises this approach as the waiter does not understand what the passenger wants until another passenger reminds him that he wants Coke a Cola which is a famous capitalist icon and instantly recognised by the waiter. The acting at all times is superb and the protagonist played by the legendary Uttam Kumar is brilliant as the cool charming affable film star whose ultimate flaws reveal the dichotomy between fiction and reality. In particular Ray's choice of an established super star of Indian cinema to play the role of a film super star has been the influence of many a film about film and makes the film's subject even more potent. Although this is a character based narrative Ray's technical brilliance means that we are treated to a aurally and visually stunning filmscape. The mesmerising visual touches abound with the use of illusions and allusions such as the nightmare scene where the protagonist finds himself in a desert made of bank notes and skeletons holding telephones. Watching this film and the intricacy of details you can begin to understand why many in the know venerate Ray as the Kubrick of the East including myself. If you don't know Ray or his works then I highly recommend you track his films down and watch because you won't be disappointed. 'Nayak The Hero' in particular deserves your unlimited attention.".

'Nayak The Hero' AKA 'O Heri' is a brilliant look into the world of filmmaking acting stardom materialism and image worship which Bengali legend Satyajit Ray's allencompassing approach masterfully constructs. His approach weaves a multilayered narrative around a film star on route to the capital of India Delhi to collect an award and through his interactions with fellow passengers on the train surreal dreams and recollections remind him of the futility of idolisation and image worship both immediately the cult of celebrity but also more expansively the cult of capitalism.

	schema:headline " Satyajit Ray's brooding treatise on fame guilt empathy and solitude";
	schema:reviewBody "Nayak aka Nayak The Hero is a 1966 Bangla drama film written and directed by the legendary Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray starring Uttam Kumar and Sharmila Tagore in the lead roles. Satyajit Ray presents the tale of a movie idol named Arindam Mukherjee who despite his fame and success is haunted by solitude and a sense of guilt. He is both a compulsive smoker and an alcoholic. Although Arindam hasn't yet tasted failure the very thought of it fills his heart with grave fear and premonitions. He has had female companions but still pines for true love. He has all the materialistic pleasures at his disposal but is robbed off his mental peace. While on a train from Calcutta to Delhi to receive an award Kumar meets a female journalist Aditi Sengupta who has little regard for movie stars. Aditi wants to interview him but she is least interested in printing what everyone already knows about the matine idol. So she blatantly asks him to reveal his true darker self to her. He however dismisses her saying that he doesn't want to selfdestruct his goodygoody image in front of his market. But Arindam soon begins to regret the missed opportunity to finally unload his burden. He then sees a dream wherein he gets drowned in a quicksand of money. When he finally wakes us he feels uneasy and out of desperation approaches Aditi to start a conversation about his rather oblivious past leaving himself completely exposed in front of her.Nayak is a testament to Satyajit Ray's remarkable range as an auteur par excellence. As a brooding character study Nayak is distinctively different from Ray's early ubiquitously renowned works like Pather Panchali 1955 and Mahanagar 1963 which are essentially dramas laden with social commentaries. The social commentary in Nayak on the other hand is mostly implicit. However the one Ray movie that Nayak does hark back to is the 1958 musical masterpiece starring the great Chhabi Biswas Jalsaghar undoubtedly one of the greatest character studies of all time. Nayak serves as a great precursor to Ray's Calcutta trilogy comprising Pratidwandi 1970 Seemabaddha 1971 and Jana Aranya 1976.In Nayak Uttam Kumar plays Arindam Mukherjee with such poise and ease that it appears as if he is portraying his own life on the celluloid. Ray gives us a vulnerable hero hiding behind his cocky largerthanlife faade. And Kumar to his credit never misses a note during his challenging portrayal. He is well complemented by Sharmila Tagore who plays the character of Aditi to a tee. Aditi is the only person Arindam opens up to the tantalizing conversations between the two characters offer some great food for thought. Ray uses the various interactions between the copassengers to make us realize that the hypocrisies and follies of a star are not much different from that of an ordinary man. A few other characters in the movie merely provide a morality check. Overall Nayak is a powerful work of cinema that like most films of Satyajit Ray remains as relevant today as it was back then. Nayak is not an easy movie to watch. Unlike other Ray films which require patience this one requires composure. There are scenes of such enormous power in Nayak that a fainthearted will get jitters while watching it. Ray's use of dream sequences to make the narrative more evocative puts him up there with the likes of Bunuel Kurosawa Bergman and Fellini. Nayak is certainly a film that every student of cinema ought to watch.This review was first published at A Potpourri of Vestiges".

Because of this the film is rather slight and I don't recommend it for folks not familiar with Ray's work as he's done better and more amazing films. This one is more for someone wanting to see all of Ray's filmseven the minor ones.The film begins with a widower meeting a holy man on a train. Soon the man is won over by the holy man and has convinced practically everyone in his family to become disciples of the guy and he comes to live with them. There is only one problemhe spouts nothing but hogwash and he's clearly a phony. For example the guy claims to be older than the Buddha and Jesus AND that he told Einstein about the theory of relativity!! So how are the family's friends going to expose the truth? See the film and find out for yourself.My biggest complaint about the film is much of the endingwhich I found a bit vague and confusing. However there are some nice character studies and the film is enjoyable. In many ways this is like an Indian version of the old Moliere play Tartuffe.".

Two daughters actually consists of two separate stories based on stories written by Rabindranath Tagore.The Postman is the better of the two stories.  Not giving away the plot this movie had one of the most heartwrenching scenes in cinema.  The simple but powerful way Ray pulls his quiet films together at their end makes these quiet films very memorable.  Sampati drags out somewhat longer but has a powerful climax of its own.  After years these two movies have stuck in my memory.  I would recommend them to anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Originally this movie comprised three separate stories by the legendary Rabindranath Thakur Tagore hence the title Teen Kanya Three Daughters. However the subtitling could not be finished in time for a Tagore anniversary so the middle story a ghost story is not included in the videocassette retitled Two Daughters. In the two remaining stories we explore the lives of two girls living in a world not of their making facing their fates with limited options. The first story The Postman is about a lowermiddleclass bourgeois city boy who goes deep into the Bengali countryside to take a job as a village postman. The daughter in this story is Ratna nicknamed Ratan his servant a little slip of a girl. In the west this girl an orphan not even at the age of adolescence is a child. How can she cope? What can she look forward to? The second story Samapti is about another girl in rural Bengal this one a little older. She's what we would call a tomboy. The life of an adult woman in this society  a housewife  wouldn't seem to be much in her taste. She is active vivacious lively brazen playful. She is known as Pagli crazy by the disapproving villagers. But it is these very qualities that attract the attention of Amulya a young college graduate who has returned home to his widowed mother to be nagged by her to settle down and take a wife  a traditional shy modest and in Amulya's view boring wife. Despite the serious subject of these two stories they are actually quite funny. The second story is even hilarious with a couple of nearslapstick sequences. In the scene in which Amulya breaks the news to his mother as to which girl he really likes pay close attention to what's happening in the background.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a fan of Ray for a long time and I have seen most of his famous films. This film was not available for some time because the quality of the film was deteriorating so badly that they had to restore the entire film. Originally made with three entirely unrelated short stories by Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore the restored version has only two stories of the original three. In both the stories Postmaster and Samapti you will find the inimitable Ray touch. You can see the same neo realistic portrayal of simple lives and events of ordinary people. Postmaster evokes a feeling of pity for the young girl but at the same time it seems to reflect the strength and courage of ordinary people going about their lives. The second story samapti though not as tight as the first it winds around a bit before it reaches a climactic finish again pours life into a simple story about a young girl who is reluctant to let go of her childhood and who is pushed into the world of adulthood. Aparna Sen  Ray finds such beautiful women to play in his movies plays this part brilliantly. The picturisque Bengal country side comes to life in this colourful black and white film. A must see for anyone who likes films.".

	schema:headline " Magnificent emotionally wrenching early film by the great Satyajit Ray";
	schema:reviewBody "This film called TEEN KANYA in Bengali and TWO DAUGHTERS in English was made six years after Ray's first film PATHER PANCHALI 1955 which was the first of the famous APU TRILOGY. Having finished that trilogy as well as another of his haunting masterpieces THE MUSIC ROOM Ray turned his attention to two wonderful short stories by Rabindranath Tagore so that this film is therefore a diptych composed of two separate films of those two stories. The first of them is entitled THE POSTMASTER and most of it is filmed in and around a small hut inhabited by a young man who has just become a village postmaster. Along with the hut and the job he has acquired a servant named Ratan who is a 10 yearold orphan girl who never knew her mother and father. The previous postmaster beat her and treated her badly but the new one is very kind and she becomes attached to him. This is the first time she has ever allowed herself to feel anything for anyone in her harsh young life. The story is one of the saddest and most heartbreaking ever filmed. The intensity of the acting by the young girl played by Chandana Banerjee is one of the most powerful child screen performances in the history of world cinema. This young girl only made one other film KAA in 1966 and after that nothing is recorded of her life or her fate. She was able to convey so much with her eyes without speaking that it was like cinematic telepathy. The ending of this film is unforgettable and will haunt any sensitive person always. The second film is not a sad story but an odd and amusing one. It concerns a girl in her late teens who is a wildly eccentric tomboy. She and her family live in a shack by the river bank having lost their home and all their possessions in one of the many floods which continually afflict Bengal the stories are set in Bengal. She likes to run wild and free swing from the trees play with the boys run and hide in the forest and always goes barefoot. She is brilliantly played by the young actress Aparna Sen whose first adult part it was she had appeared in one film previously as a child. She went on to become one of India's most famous serious film actresses and has appeared in 62 films including others by Satyajit Ray such as DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE FOREST 1970 and THE MIDDLEMAN 1976. She also appeared in James Ivory's THE GURU 1969 with Michael York and Rita Tushingham as well as James Ivory's BOMBAY TALKIE 1970 with Felicity Kendal. In this film Sen evokes the mystery and the animal energy of the wild young creature in an unforgettable portrayal of a girl in rebellion at becoming a woman and a wife and thus forfeiting her freedom. These days the film should be adopted by feminists as a manifesto statement. Satyajit Ray was notable for making many films sympathetic to women girls and children and he had a rare understanding of the vagaries of feminine psychology. His films are often as much psychology lessons as they are high art. And he had the ability to get his actors and actresses to give of their best and then more besides. Certainly Ray's films are some of the most emotionally moving and psychologically profound works of cinema ever made. But in addition to that they are technical masterpieces as well. For this film Ray was director producer writer and composer of the music. Ray was certainly one of the three great Bengali geniuses of the 20th century another being Rabindranath Tagore himself and the third being unquestionably Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose the scientist who collaborated with Albert Einstein and after whom BoseEinstein Condensates are named. But if you have never heard of BoseEinstein Condensates you are forgiven as they are highly technical and even most physicists have never heard of them.".

It comprise snapshots of various human characteristics like pride simplicity carnal desires thoughtlessness romance heroism and above all triumph of human spirits over conventional social idiosyncrasy. All this happens in the hill station of Darjeeling in the lap of nature with the picturesque eastern Himalayas in the backdrop.In a nutshell Kanchenjungha is a film about a wealthy classy family their views experiences and approach towards life with the central theme revolving around a prospective matrimonial alliance between the younger daughter of the family and a wellestablished consultant.The Film The screenplay begins by presenting the last day of the vacation for the Chowdhurys headed by Raibahadur Indranath Chowdhury Chhobi Biswas. The opening scene is a collage of shots which establishes different members of the family and their respective modus operandi. The melodious grandfather clock announces 4o clock in the background.We find Indranath keen to visit the Mall in anticipation of a positive consequence of schema related to his younger daughter Monisha's Alakananda Ray alliance with his newly found prodigy Mr.Banerjee N.Visanathan. His wife Labanya Karuna Banerjee a timid sensitive lady taking time to wrapup last minute packing. Her brother Jagadish Chatterjee Pahari Sanyal an ardent bird watcher in this film consciously avoids Indranath's speculation by taking refuge in a book. Indranath's only son enacted by Anil Chatterjee hurries to meet his date while the elder daughter Anima Anubha Gupta a suave stylish woman receives and promptly hides a correspondence in her purse. We could get a glimpse of her nervous glances revealing a possible secretive endeavor amidst marital sanctity. Her husband Shankar Haridhan Mukherjee looks laid back and sarcastic with mixed feelings towards the latest groomhunting process initiated by his inlaws. There lies an underlying current of tension between him and his wife that gets confirmed by his advice to Monisha about not to get married without falling in love citing the ineffectiveness of his own status.Cut to a parallel sequence of an elderly middleclass man exhausted of climbing up the stairs to the Mall with his humble nephew Ashok Arun Mukherjee who apparently is searching for a job.It is mentionable that the background of all the above characters their thought process and behavioral traits have been brilliantly presented through series of well conceived dialogues. Yes only dialogues. No third person narratives. No visual manifestation in terms of flash back dream sequences etc. In fact the master storyteller has been able to generate such an evocative dialogue sequences that at the end of the film the audience acquire full capacity to judge each and every character in the light of respective rationale.It is also noteworthy that Ray's characters never surpass the humane status quo. They reflect relevant cognitive behavior and contextual influences. Be it Siddartha in Pratidwandi or Arindam in Nayak one can never expect Ray's protagonists molded in typical ubermanesque image in stark contrast to the socalled Heroes of Hollywood and Bollywood.Kanchenjungha substantiate that. The elitist urban Mr.Banerjee asserts boastfully about his professional and materialistic achievements. He even confesses about his clandestine foreign affairs while wooing his ladylove Monisha. This refined gentleman also depicts a prosaic approach towards conjugality and life in general. Towards the end he displays an extremely liberal and tolerant attitude which is commendable in the realms of dominating patriarchal association.Although we see Monisha mostly in pensive escapist mode we also get to catch her in rare vivacity while interacting with Ashok  a chapter which hints at the potential of romance between the wellborn Monisha and Ashok of humble existence who transcend commonality by disobeying the archetypal narcissistic Indranath Chowdhury.The AnimaShankar track provides an indepth analysis of a marriage going haywire due to lack of understanding and interpersonal rapport. Through a thoughtprovoking evocative conversation between the two we witness the gradual transition of the couple in pursuit of a fulfilling married life post admission of their respective peccancy  Anima indulging into an illicit loveaffair and Shankar imbibing ancestral traits like gambling and mindless extravagance.The promiscuous son perfects the art of flattery and triviality in the romantic surrounding of Darjeeling.The ever cheerful simplistic and benevolent Jagadish portrays the perceptive ornithologist who is detached from worldly desires but plays his part well in comprehending the nuances of familial situations.After a lifetime of unconditional subjugation to her husband Labonya ascends to an assertive inspiring parent.Even Chhobi Biswas had his uncharacteristic vulnerable moments when he tries to justify his accurate decisionmaking capability to his uncertain wife or displays childish exuberance while talking to Ashok.The brilliant soundtracks right from the Lepcha song to the appropriate background score like the bird whistle noisy interlude of the radio or jingle of bells tied to the yaks contribute immensely to the dimensions of the miseenscene.Beside Ace editor Dulal Datta did an exceptionally well rendition in terms of synchronizing multiple charactersequences in perfection without compromising on the pace of the movie.Any writeup on Kanchenjungha would remain unfinished if it doesn't mention the incorporation of 'nature' that accentuated the varied moods of the film  An overcast evening to suggest unfavorable circumstances mist to render underlying tension and sunshine to portray agreeable settlement.

In many many many ways these films are nothing like the Bollywood films of todayand there is no singing and the fairytalelike plots of many of the newer films is totally absent. Realism is the keyand a bit reminiscent of Ozu's films about ordinary but likable folks.

	schema:reviewBody "Located on the border between Nepal and the state of Sikkim in India Kanchenjungha also spelled Kangchenjunga is the highest mountain in India and the third highest in the world. That its setting for a film would be lovely is a given but the fact that the mountain is often covered in mist makes it a perfect metaphor for the obstacles that can cloud people's vision. Such is the theme of Satyajit Ray's 1962 film Kanchenjunga a look at changing values in the early days of Indian independence. It is a film that is firmly fixed in the Ray tradition slow moving intimate and lyrical filled with conflicted characters social commentary exquisite music and enchanting children.Kanchenjunga deals with parallel stories and the interconnectedness of people's lives a format that would be even more in vogue fifteen years later. Focused on the upper middleclass Choudhuri family vacationing in Darjeeling the story unfolds in real time taking place in one day. The father Indranath Chhabi Biswas who has nothing but admiration for the former British rulers has played the system to reach his position as the powerful head of five companies. The pompous patriarch usually gets his way and both he and his normally submissive wife Labanya Roy Karuna Bannerjee expect his daughter Monisha Alaknanda Roy to follow his wishes and marry a dull but rising bureaucrat named Bannerjee N. Viswanathan who if nothing else can provide his bride with security.What Indranath has not counted on however is that Monisha has a mind of her own and an oldfashioned idea that love should play a part in whom you marry. Labanya asserts herself as well telling Monisha that she has to make up her own mind. The story takes place as the characters walk along the scenic hill station in late afternoon waiting for the clouds to clear so they can get a good view of the mountains. Another prominent player Ashoke Arun Mukherjee a 24yearold working class man from Calcutta who had tutored Indranath's son Anil when he was a little boy is on vacation with his uncle. The semicomic uncle wants him to cozy up to Indranath envisioning the possibilities for a job paying 300 rupees a month for his nephew. Ashoke takes the opportunity and meets the tycoon but is treated like a servant Indranath asking him to go to his room to bring him his red muffler.The young man gets the last laugh however when he turns down his offer of a job after a long monologue about how successful he has become. More importantly to Ashoke however is his meeting with Indranath's daughter Monisha. Though they come from different economic levels of society their unpretentiousness draw them to each other and their budding relationship holds promise for the future. Other characters are Monisha's older sister Anima Anubha Gupta and her husband Shankar Subrata Sen Sharma who are trying to patch up a relationship that has broken down as a result of his drinking and gambling and her longterm affair with another man but they are bound together by the love of their young daughter who rides a horse around the hill during the entire afternoon.These subdramas play out against the background of the imposing mountains. As evening approaches and the sky clears the characters liberated by the beauty that surrounds them are able to see with clarity a society changing before their eyes and how their lives have been forever affected. Kanchenjungha is Ray's first color film and one that he produced and directed wrote the original screenplay and composed the music an impressive feat. Though none of his subsequent work ever reached the stratospheric heights of The Apu Trilogy the mark of a great director is when one of his obscure minor films can fit into the category of a masterpiece. It's a good fit for Kanchenjungha.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is Ray's first1. Colored movie 2. Movie whose script is written by Ray himself 3. Movie whose story duration is only one day.After Kanchenjungha Ray made a number of BW movies until 1973 when he made second colored movie The Distant Thunder. In most of his career Ray used to make movies out of novels and stories written by famous BENGALI writers. E.g. his best known works of APU TRILOGY Pather Panchali Aparajito and Apur Sansar are actually movie version of Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's novels. In the same way he made movies out of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore's stories and novels e.g. Three Daughters Charulata and GhareBaire. But this is one of the three movies whose writing credits fully goes to Ray himself other 2 are Nayak and Agantuk.

And of course all of these 3 movies are great works of Ray.Indranath Choudhury Chhabi Bishwas along with his whole family goes to the beautiful hilly city of Darjeeling to spend vacation. Members of his family and some other characters of the movie start reacting differently influenced by the immense beauty and power of Kanchenjungha Highest pick of India also it is one peak of the mighty Himalayas. Anima daughter of Indranath confesses her secret love affair to her husband and assures him to amend the relationship for the betterment of Tuklu their daughter. Labyanya Roy Choudhury wo Indranath becomes worried for her husband's plan of giving their daughter Monisha's marriage to a more materialistic guy Banarjee. Ashok a tormented poor young man also refuses to accept any job offer from Indranath. In fact the mesmerizing effect of Kanchenjungha on the characters of this film is done with incredible perfection. On my judgement Kanchenjungha along with Nayak are the best movies made by Ray. I also rate those films as two great movies ever made in film history.".

Movie whose story duration is only one day.After Kanchenjungha Ray made a number of BW movies until 1973 when he made second colored movie The Distant Thunder. In most of his career Ray used to make movies out of novels and stories written by famous BENGALI writers. E.g. his best known works of APU TRILOGY Pather Panchali Aparajito and Apur Sansar are actually movie version of Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's novels. In the same way he made movies out of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore's stories and novels e.g. Three Daughters Charulata and GhareBaire. But this is one of the three movies whose writing credits fully goes to Ray himself other 2 are Nayak and Agantuk. In all these three movies he in someway tries to speak about his own thoughts and philosophies of life via the characters of these movies.

The mother the youngest daughter and the unemployed youth haven't got any such problems. That however is the advantage of a daylong chronicle. The patriarch is as much a caricature as the good people are. But it's just a single day in their lives and even that was enough for Mr. Choudhuri to change tracks. Apparently this film was the first time Ray wrote by himself without adapting from a source. Like in Sonar Kella he gets his terrain right.

The head of family Mr. Indranath Roy is an industrialist and wants to marry his younger daughter Monisha to a boy of his choice who is educated rich and has family legacy. They are left together alone for some time. Monisha isn't interested in such a kind of marriage as she knows about the failure of her sister's marriage and her pretence. Accidentally she meets Ashok a young boy from Calcutta who refused a job offer from Roy Bahadur and likes him. She admits this only in the end of the movie as she could not say it directly to Mr. Bannerjee the rich guy. In between her sister tells her husband about her affair which eventually they settle out. Her mother is in a situation where she wants Monisha not to marry Mr. Bannerjee but can't tell her husband why she feels so. Finally Monisha politely refuses to marry and connects with Ashok and everything ends positively.Though nothing happens between them but presence of a boy whom she likes a romantic location and of course the misty atmosphere gives Monisha the required courage to refuse. At the end everyone is happy. Well except Roy Bahadur who feels defeated that her daughter has rejected a proposal and has invited home a boy who she has just met and who has rejected his job offer. He feels so gloomy and sad that he even turns his back to a visible Kanchenjungha which was covered in fog through out their vacation and in his words would make his vacation perfect once visible. There are many things which make this movie stand out of Ray's other films. It has an optimistic ending with all issues resolved there are no posttragedy situations. The movie is in color the characters wear same clothes all through the movie to make it more realistic multiple plots dialogues are kept witty and very straight with no complexities quite a few in English and lastly the movie is shot in picturesque and romantic location of Darjeeling. The dialogues were good and witty which kept the movie light. Two extra characters were put in the movie to add to its humor a guy who takes pictures of girls and gets knocked out every time and a young boy who reacts with his expressions as the story goes along. In the end he also sings the popular Nepali folk song Chiya Bari Maa which perfectly suits the situation. The movie was surely way ahead of its time. But this is Ray's great direction that even fifty years later it didn't seem outdated or boring. I have no clue to why this movie was a flop and was so much criticized.However I enjoyed every moment of it. In all another Ray movie added in my good movies list. I give it 9 on 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "German Edgar Wallace flicks from the early 60s  a cheesy kind of cinema but as far as I am considered also a very lovable one. Crime flicks and murder mysteries based on the writings of the British novelist Edgar Wallace were immensely popular in Germany of the 1960s some of them were also very cool others immensely corny and almost all of them incredibly entertaining in one way or another. Das Rtsel Der Roten Orchidee aka. The Secret Of The Red Orchid of 1962 would probably be one of the inferior Edgar Wallace films if it wasn't for two ingenious actors. This cheesy crime mystery does not only star the incredibly sinister Klaus Kinski as many other Wallace films but also one of cinema's greatest Horror icons the almighty Christopher Lee. Lee who plays an American FBI agent was dubbed in the English language version but he can be heard speaking German in the original German version and his German is amazingly good.Several rich people are murdered in London and the murders are somehow connected with a gang of blackmailers. Since the crimes seem like the work of Chicago mobsters American FBI Captain Allermann Christopher Lee comes to London to help the investigating Scotland Yard Inspector Weston Adrian Hoven.The plot itself is quite lame and full of illogical twists but the film nevertheless promises pure entertainment. Christopher Lee is a great enrichment as always but the best aspect of the movie is Klaus Kinski who shines in a very sinister role. Sexy Marisa Mell is once again stunningly beautiful in the female lead and the comedic part goes to Eddi Aren't who plays role of the butler once again. This is not one of the highlights in the popular series of Edgar Wallacebased films that were made in Germany between 1959 and the early 70s but it is amusing lighthearted entertainment and recommendable for Christopher Lee Klaus Kinski and beautiful Marissa Mell.".

There's probably more comedy in this Krimi than I've seen in my limited experience with these movies and fortunately some of it works. Eddi Arnett's Butler of Death is a character that could have been really annoying in lesser hands. The rest of the cast is just as capable. In addition to Lee and Hoven the film also features genre legend Klaus Kinski as mob boss head Gunner Steve and the always delightful Marisa Mell in an early role. Lee Hoven Kinski and Mell in the same movie! It's a Eurofilm lovers dream! On the downside there are plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. Why does it take the police so long to catch the blackmailers? They know right from the start who is responsible for the killings. Another big problem with the film is the dubbing. Lee's dubbing is horrible. He sounds as flat as can be. And the dubbing of the gangsters has them sounding like a bunch of cartoon characters. The poor dubbing certainly takes away from the enjoyment of the film.".

As with many of these films its a bit confusing at first with several plot threads wandering through the story Chicago gangsters FBI agent the blackmail scheme before coming together at the end. Unfortunately this really isn't a story where its worth seeing how it all comes together. The plot is more than a bit unfocused even by this series standardsThere are too many characters and too much comedy so that the film fails to be compelling. My unhappiness with the film could be the result of the English dub which has even Christopher Lee and Klaus Kinski dubbed by other actors who's vocal performances don't even approximate how Lee or Kinski would have done it themselves. The result is that you never really buy whats going on screen. Certainly this would be perfect if you stumbled on it at 2am on late night TV but I would be hard pressed to suggest actually renting or buying this on DVD and putting it on willingly.".

One thing that just drove me bonkers was the way hoods would shoot people and the camera would close in to show that the victims of bulletfire had no wounds or even a hint of blood..the effect of Minelli's fate for instance is ruined because of a closeup showing not the slightest hint of bodily damage. The film itself is rather a bore I must admit. But seeing Lee and Kinski opposite each other even if for just one scene is quite a thrill.

Director Helmut Ashley has not worked on other films from the franchise so I believe this is probably his biggest achievement. Writer Egon Eis is a name I have not heard before but he has a fairly decent body of work also including titles that may still be somewhat famous over half a century later. And the cast includes a couple decent names too mostly Christopher Lee playing the lead detective in here. And the best thing is he was fluent in German and we really hear his voice. Adrian Hoven and Eddi Aren't may be known too to German audiences. The biggest female character is played by the stunning tragically shortlived Marisa Mell. And last but not least Klaus Kinski plays a mysterious antagonist? as he does in some other Edgar Wallace movies. In any case he is a scene stealer. But all these talented actors are not enough if the script and story in here is so underwhelming as it is here. What a disappointment. This film had potential for so much more. I cannot say if it's Eis' or Wallace's fault but the plot was just never interesting and the reference in the title not yet the antagonist as later on feels pretty random. I have to give this one a thumbs down. Not recommended and I am glad it runs for only slightly over 80 minutes.".

Often the silliest voices are usedsounding very fake and stupid. However take notemy review is ONLY for this dubbed version. The original film might be a lot better and worth seeingespecially since some dubbings actually change around the plot and even produce a very different movie from the original.The film is a gangster flickjust the sort of thing you wouldn't expect to see with Christopher Leeespecially since he plays an American FBI man. It begins with one gang of mobsters wiping out another. Then the mobster who was responsible is shown being deported. Soon after various rich folks start receiving extortion lettersthey either must pay or die! Oddly in a mistranslation they call it 'blackmail'a slightly different crime.Frankly this is an incredibly dull film from start to finishdespite its extortion plot. With lousy dubbing bad music and lousy writing I can't see much reason to waste your time with this one.".

The first problem lies in Miss Kellerman herself. She is to put it kindly a ham of the first water. Her only rival in the scenerychewing department would be John Barrymore at his worst.Okay so we're not watching the film to see fine acting but simply to view the legendary Annette Kellerman in her prime. Well this aspect is none too bright either. Miss Kellerman has aged a little since she frolicked around as a mermaid in Neptune's Daughter 1914 and although she is still a tophole diver and swimmer her figure is a little chunky or at least a little too muscular by 2008 standards of feminine beauty.Never mind that! What about the swimming and the underwater ballet fantasy? Well that's a bit of a letdown too. I guess I was expecting something akin to the Esther Williams' reenactments in Million Dollar Mermaid 1952. This sequence here is brightly colored but long and repetitious.Oddly the best thing about the movie is not Miss Kellerman not the swimming and underwater sequences not the location scenery but the oldhat plot! True Robert Ramsey makes a dull hero his career lasted only two films but Australian actor Norman French puts a bit of life into his villain and director Sullivan himself Miss Kellerman's reallife husband is very personable and charismatic as the first mate.".

The central character played skillfully by Barun Chanda  is quiet and charming and superficially ambiguous about the appearances his position requires him to maintain a little too flirtatious perhaps especially with his sisterinlaw who plays the movie's moral conscience but when it comes down to it ruthless in his ambition I found his mixed motivations wholly convincing.

	schema:reviewBody "This story is about an unusual man. Despite living in the impoverished city of Calcutta he is amazingly rich by Indian standards. Shyamalendu Barun Chanda is a manager at a fan factoryand he's clearly being groomed to become a member of the board of directors. His entire life is his job and getting on the board. So even though he has a great apartment and a loving and beautiful wife his one love is his work. Just how seriously screwed up his sense of priorities are becomes all too apparent later in the film.Into his life comes change in the form of his sisterinlaw. She comes to visit and she seems a bit put off by the banality of their lifethough she is neither nasty about it nor was an unwelcome guest. And slowly you can see that Shyamalendu begins to develop some feelings for her and wants her respect and acceptance. No the story does NOT become tawdrythere is no affair here. But when he makes a VERY unscrupulous decision to help him out of a scrape at work thus preserving his chances at advancement she seems to understand what he's done.This is the third film Satyajit Ray film I've seen in the last couple weeksand it's probably my least favorite of the three. But considering how wonderful the other two were this is not necessarily a bad thing. After all Company Limited is quite original and compelling....even if the pace seems at times glacially slow. I think much of this is exacerbated by the stark quality of the filmwithout music very lowkey acting as well as a lowkey script.Well worth seeingjust not a Ray masterpiece. Also while it does not detract from the film despite being made in the 1970s it was in black  white. I have no idea if this is because Indian films still were being made this way or if Ray deliberately chose this.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good movie but not one of Ray's best. The acting is pretty good by the main leads and it has a good story however it loses something in the execution. The direction does not involve the audience and keeps them at a distance.Its the story of the rapid rise of an educated and street smart person up the corporate ladder of a successful Britainbased multinational company and his experience in that position. This is juxtaposed with his personal life. The film concentrates most of its running time with the character's family.The movie starts with a prologue which provides us with an information overload and forces us to pay attention from the very first minute. This information is essential as the entire movie revolves around it. However the story does not lose anything if people are unable to grasp all the information thrown at them within the first 5 minutes. The story flows smoothly however a key element in the story is not made clear which makes the ending seem pretty melodramatic which it isn't and had this element been conveyed properly the end would make complete sense. Nevertheless the Angel DVD's summary of the film clarifies this aspect which is unfortunate and shows a lack of direction from Ray.This movie should be considered as supplementary to the other and much better Ray films Jana Aranya The Middleman and Mahanagar The Big City which also deal with the corporate world and its effect on people's personal lives.In the end the movie does not leave us very impressed but hard core Ray fans will watch it anyways. Five stars for a good story cinematography and the acting.".

Often compared to Thelma and Louise it may begin along similar lines but it's ultimate destination is quite different.  It is not a film about women's issues but human issues more specifically how we get to happiness or how it gets to us.  It addresses those issues unforgettably.some spoilersMarianne Johnson has been running to what she thinks are solutions but which turn out to be bigger problems.  Now in a marriage with an abusive husband in Normal Wyoming she runs again not toward a new solution but to a bus bench where she meets Darly a barmaid who is leaving to claim property in Alaska.They head off together and inspired by Marianne's disastrous choices Darly makes Marianne take a vow to let their path be totally dictated by chance. Along the way there are successes and more disasters as well as revelations about Darly's past that reveal she too has chosen to run with disastrous consequences.They arrive in Palmer Valley Alaska to far less than what Darly expected but which Marianne curiously feels she wants to live with because it chose me. Darly however despite her talk of letting things just happen must run away again.  By throwing a dart at a map in a local bar Darly picks a new place to run to ironically named Paradise.  In the end though Darly's actions to get her the money to get her to Paradise only end up forcing her to confront what running away before did to her life.The film is a fable but one that teaches its lessons about life and the choices we make transparently.  Often hysterically funny it can also be deeply moving and intensely disturbing.  Nonetheless it generates forgiveness and understanding for even the most reprehensible characters in it ultimately making us believe happy endings can happen it's just that they may not be the happy endings we were looking for.Credit the remarkable performances of just about the entire cast but especially Christine Lahti as Darly and Meg Tilly and Marianne as well as the perfect script by Ed Solomon who also has a bit part as the man who rejects 66 at the dance club.".

As Lahti decides to do something different and heads to Alaska to reclaim her old unfinished homestead she gives Tilley a ride.They are unlikely road buddies like Thelma and Louise were.

Ultimately they bring out the better persons residing in each.Along the way their car breaks down they get a ride with another lady pulling a trailer then they are given her car and trailer when a wealthy bumpkin asks her to stay and marry him. They work their way to Alaska and look up the property where the unfinished shell of a house still stands weatherbeaten. Through a lot of posturing eventually they both decide to stay we see the house being completed in a timelapse series of shots. Lahti decides to try and find her daughter that she abandoned in the local hospital 18 years earlier.Both act well but Tilley is a joy to watch. Her portrayal of the halfditzy insecure woman is just perfect. Makes me wonder whatever happened to Meg Tilley? She hasn't made a theatrical release movie since 1994.  Unlike Thelma and Louise where they drive off Dead Horse Point in Utah at the end the lives of these two women literally begin as this movie ends.  Seen on the Women's Entertainment channel a really good movie doesn't always take itself too seriously and has an uplifting message. We are left to wonder if Lahti ever finds her daughter whether Tilley's trucker friend ever shows up again. Maybe they considered a sequel but the film wasn't popular to warrant that.".

I laughed my butt off on several occasions.In all this was a really cool movie.  It's not for all tastes but I think it's worth viewing.";

	schema:reviewBody "While this road trip movie isn't as good as Thelma and Louise it really shouldn't be compared. The two films are very different. While Thelma and Louise are on the run the police Mary Ann and Darly the two main characters of Leaving Normal are only on the run from themselves. Meg Tilly and Christine Lahti play the title characters with just the right touches of naivete and cynicism. Mary Ann is leaving a bad marriage her second and Darly is heading to Alaska to reclaim land from an earlier marriage. Their paths merge in Normal Wyoming and they set out on a road trip that changes both of them. A few of the scenes thankfully very few don't seem to work  almost as if they were added for comic effect. Both actresses give great performances. If you can overlook a few plot problems their new overweight friend Sixtysix seems to find a rich man and leaves all of her belongings behind with Mary Ann and Darly all in the same day I think you'll find this movie to be an enjoyable and touching tale. The tag line of the movie is Sometimes the only way to find where you're going is to lose your way. I don't know about you but in my life that has been true more than a few times. Oh be sure not to miss the best scene in the whole film. When returning to their car with coolant after it has overheated to find the car stripped and their possessions strewn everywhere Mary Ann always trying to believe things will work out says We'll still get there. We'll still get to Alaska. Cynical Darly gets the best line in the film You're just like a punching bag aren't you Mary Ann? Knock you down and you get back up. I bet you're one of those people who say when life gives you lemons make lemonade. Well guess what sweetheart life hasn't given us lemons it's given us SHIT! I laughed so hard the first time I watched this scene and it's still a line I quote on one of those days when nothing seems to go right. Rent this movie and you won't be sorry.".

It's a story about the friendship between Darly and Marianne who met at a busstop after Marianne ran away from her abusive husband. Darly is going to Alaska and decided to take Marianne along with her sort of like a daughter figure. Marianne always likes to look on the bright side of things which leads her into bad situations. Darly is assertive but goodnatured she means well. And because she was so witty it made the film much more enjoyable. The first half of the movie is a roadmovie Which consist of the troubles they face of trying to get to their destination and when they get there they want to leave at least Darly does. It's a lighthearted drama and all ends well. Worth a watch.".

My friends and I really enjoyed this film when we saw it back in 1992 when we were big into early 90s quirk with films like What's Eating Gilbert Grape Gas Food Lodging Simple Men and Surviving Desire. Leaving Normal fits quite neatly into this group of films. It also reminds me of one of my alltime favorite and most watched films which also happens to be a story about an unlikely female friendship Bagdad Cafe 1987.It's difficult for me to assess Leaving Normal with any sense of objectivity. When I watched it again recently I was overcome with a sense of nostalgia for the early 90s when I was in my early 20s and was yet to make some pretty dumb decisions with my life it all turned out okay though. I don't think the film has aged especially well I'm thinking about some shoddy matte paintings and its quirkiness may just annoy some people but it has enough to offer the casual viewer to be entertaining. If you are fortunate enough to be open to its sincere message about the universe having a place for everyone if we will just let go and allow ourselves then you may find that you bond with Marianne and Darly and all the offbeat characters they meet on their journey towards wholeness. You may then find that you make a space for this little film in your heart like most of the other reviewers on this site.".

When I watched it again recently I was overcome with a sense of nostalgia for the early 90s when I was in my early 20s and was yet to make some pretty dumb decisions with my life it all turned out okay though. I don't think the film has aged especially well I'm thinking about some shoddy matte paintings and its quirkiness may just annoy some people but it has enough to offer the casual viewer to be entertaining. If you are fortunate enough to be open to its sincere message about the universe having a place for everyone if we will just let go and allow ourselves then you may find that you bond with Marianne and Darly and all the offbeat characters they meet on their journey towards wholeness. You may then find that you make a space for this little film in your heart like most of the other reviewers on this site.";

Naturally Spike is pursued by the police one of the officers being Sarah's uncle for statutory rape but the audience is supposed to sympathize for him being that he is separated from his true love.

It meanders from one indie film clich to the next shot in blue rape scene lots of rain weak symbolism etc. that you can create a drinking game based on this movie. The first ten minutes of this movie have the couple laying in bed doing heroin snow falling over them and Spike mumbling something about Angels and Dragons.The one star for this movie is for Emma Bing who is not a bad actress the only real likable character in the film and dare I say kind of cute.

I might even throw in Dumb and Dumber in there as well since Spike and Sarah constantly do things that make you want to scream Don't do that or Don't go in there often. The plot is a bit disjointed at times which makes it a tough movie to sit through and its grim theme makes it even harder. The music is surpisingly mostly nonpunk which added a slowness to the film that just didn't work for me.

It is a very moody sad movie that puts you in a mood and doesn't want to let you go. Overall I would suggest watching it and letting the story sink in. It's a great drama! It reminds me of growing up and all the pressures put on people who are just trying to do the right thing but are constantly pounded down by the decisions they make and others make for them.

Along with her the ghost also dies? Give me a break.This movie is a Waste of time. Use it better by sleeping. It is not that it is badly directed there is nothing new to be shown.

	schema:reviewBody "A sequel is primarily planned to take advantage of the successful connection established by the original with the audiences. Hence as a necessary ingredient a sequel should not only have the essence of its first part but should also essentially surpass its original in content and achievement. No doubt it's really tough to do that and it needs a lot of hard work to repeat the success enjoyed by the original. But Phoonk 2 amazingly breaks all set notions of making a sequel and goes on to make a statement which is completely underworked strange and overconfident.As a straight remark Phoonk 2 has been made only for the sake of trying a sequel. It is vaguely based on the story of revenge being taken by the spirit of the lady who was killed in the first part. But apart from this one line idea of vengeance it has got nothing in the name of horror to offer to its viewers. Starting with the same old tried and tested formula of shifting to a new house which obviously is the haunted one the movie doesn't even try to give something new to its fans. Right from the first scene itself you feel the same type of ambiance background sounds and camera angles served in the name of the sequel which was very unexpected from the veteran Ram Gopal Verma and his team of directors.With an extremely slow pace Phoonk 2 never ever starts really. It keeps testing your patience with slow camera movements introducing you to the every corner of the house but not the spirit. A very lazy and uninteresting first half clearly gives you an idea that RGV has once again tried to play around with his one line ideas wasting both the money and time of his diehard fans. Moving into the second half the viewer doesn't feel excited anymore to see what happens next as he can easily guess all the future proceedings with his eyes closed. The over lengthy and unexplainable climax comes as another torture for the viewer and one just wants to leave the theater as soon as possible to catch on to the ongoing IPL match instead coming on the Television.In few words the movie has nothing to offer in any of its department involved in filmmaking. The writers have written the sequences only around a one line idea provided to them and have added the same old doll crow a maid a tantric a new house and a spirit into the script and that's it. The sound designer puts in the same sources exploited in the other horror films from the famous production house. The actors have performed fine as their true duty towards RGV and the director but one simply misses the strong presence of Ashwini Kalsekar in this sequel. The cameraman shoots the movie using the same manual of RGV's previous horror movies and the director Milind Gadagkar wastes his golden opportunity to connect with the viewers.Interestingly the promotional campaign uses a tagline below the title of the movie which goes as The first was a warning. But in reality the line should be taken as a warning before opting for the movie in the theaters spending both your valuable time and money. Still if you really want to get scared then go for a famous Asian Horror flick instead as the genre is best understood by those filmmakers in the entire globe.In the end I would only like to say that Horror movies not necessarily have to be made revolving around the same repeated idea of a haunted house and a spirit. RGV is still making all these horror movies based on his own old formula adopted in his first attempt in the genre called Raat released in 1992. But now it's high time to move on to some new unexplored ideas at least for the sake of his uncountable fans like myself. Ironically Raat still remains his best masterpiece till date so just go for it if you haven't seen it yet.".

So as well as the bracing location photography the blazing sun the breeze rustling the groves the huge rock quarry the impassive river the dusty roads 'Toni' is full of sounds of footsteps bicycles industrial machines but mostly of people talking singing fighting working playing  eating.  Even today seven decades on and all our advances in technology 'Toni' has the rare ability to convince you of an organic teeming world.But even before the term was invented Renoir exposes the limitations of neorealism.  Even ignoring the truism that pointing the camera at something is a subjective choice rather than an objective representation you can't just point a camera at nature or people and expect audiences to remain interested except the most dedicated Warholian.  So you need a story.Renoir may not accept the sentimentality that would become de Sica's stockintrade but he does offer the hoariest of narratives  the love triangle and murder.  This is not to say that Renoir doesn't infuse these contrivances with an unheardof humanity that the beginning of Toni's affair with Josepha on a grovebordered byroad isn't one of the most touching scenes in all cinema Machiavellian flirtation unwittingly sparking tragedy and despair but at this stage full of fun and play even if a bee sting no matter how suggestive isn't terribly auspicious suggesting a slow poison breaking down sprightly young bodies or that the murder scene has an inexorable immediacy that transcends genre.We don't even know that the film is heading in a generic direction until near the end which makes the murder seem like it arose from realistic inevitability rather than generic necessity.  That said an artificial narrative frame is fixed onto the realism and all the artistic decisions reinforce this frame e.g. the need to focus on this particular character or incident rather than not.There is a second frame imposed the subtextual one if you like the formal patterning which repeats scenes images motifs etc. right down to the circularity of the plot beginning and ending with singing refugees disembarking a train for a new life the exact same pan that ends on a bridge.  This is a realistic bridge  it carries the refugees to the town it is a narrative bridge where the film's plot harrowingly climaxes but it is also a symbolic i.e. nonnaturalistic bridge of crossing thresholds connection escape etc.This is not to disparage Renoir's realism or the complex humanity it engenders the moving naturalism he elicits from his wonderful actors. Rather it is to praise his critical genius.  The framework he places on his realism the artifice of certain scenes the wedding where Toni and Marie are removed from the local context against a stark black background the theatrical posturing of Albert as he seduces Josepha the stylised filming of the murder and the climactic standoff all create the film's meaning whether that is the way human codes stifle freedom after all these are refugees who have escaped totalitarianism or whatever.Like Monet's portraits of the same phenomena at different periods of the day Renoir shoots the same characters and locales at discretely different periods of time revealing change and loss in a changeless environment. 'Toni' is a very great masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Excop Ray Mercer gets released from jail and is picked up by his estranged wife Rebecca.  She is now seeing casino boss Charles Atlas and they stop off at one of his casinos on the ride to a cheap hotel for Ray.  When in the casino Ray idly plays the games with his last few dollars and wins the jackpot.  However before he can collect his money the casino is robbed  leaving Ray not only trying to get his prize money but mistaken as part of the gang.  With double crosses and shootouts all over the place all Ray wants is his winnings.This promises much  look at the cast to see the potential.  However what it delivers can be summed up buy it's weak plot.  The story essentially sees Ray Mercer put in lots of action scenes  using the thinnest of excuses to keep the story moving.  For example Ray jumps onto an armoured car and hangs on the roof the truck then crashes and drives through a huge explosion  but Ray is unharmed.  Likewise we have the bad guys who do the robbery spend the whole film running round the hotel killing everyone looking for a way out  but yet the armed police on the ground floor cant seem to catch them!To be fair the spectacle is good  but it's bangs without substance.  The action is OTT  does no one ever run out of bullets?  The action has no real tension or excitement to it and is really dull  if you just want guns then you might like this but really it's a poor action movie.It's a shame because they managed to get a great cast on board.  Weller and Tia Carrere are OK names and give OK performances.  But add to that names like Dennis Hopper and Joe Pantoliano and you've got a good cast. Unfortunately none of them have anything to work with at all.  The support cast also has plenty of familiar faces but again they are little more than cardboard cutouts who are there to get shot at or shoot people.

The action fails to ignite any interest and the whole think flops badly.  What a way to waste a great cast  the director has been making films since the 50's  has he learnt nothing in all that time?".

	onyx:emotionText "Excop Ray Mercer gets released from jail and is picked up by his estranged wife Rebecca.  She is now seeing casino boss Charles Atlas and they stop off at one of his casinos on the ride to a cheap hotel for Ray.  When in the casino Ray idly plays the games with his last few dollars and wins the jackpot.  However before he can collect his money the casino is robbed  leaving Ray not only trying to get his prize money but mistaken as part of the gang.  With double crosses and shootouts all over the place all Ray wants is his winnings.This promises much  look at the cast to see the potential.  However what it delivers can be summed up buy it's weak plot.  The story essentially sees Ray Mercer put in lots of action scenes  using the thinnest of excuses to keep the story moving.  For example Ray jumps onto an armoured car and hangs on the roof the truck then crashes and drives through a huge explosion  but Ray is unharmed.  Likewise we have the bad guys who do the robbery spend the whole film running round the hotel killing everyone looking for a way out  but yet the armed police on the ground floor cant seem to catch them!To be fair the spectacle is good  but it's bangs without substance.  The action is OTT  does no one ever run out of bullets?  The action has no real tension or excitement to it and is really dull  if you just want guns then you might like this but really it's a poor action movie.It's a shame because they managed to get a great cast on board.  Weller and Tia Carrere are OK names and give OK performances.  But add to that names like Dennis Hopper and Joe Pantoliano and you've got a good cast. Unfortunately none of them have anything to work with at all.  The support cast also has plenty of familiar faces but again they are little more than cardboard cutouts who are there to get shot at or shoot people.  These include Tagawa from Mortal Kombat Kove Karate Kid Cagney  Lacey Peter Coyote Sphere Patch Adams.Overall this is really daft plotting at it's worst.  The action fails to ignite any interest and the whole think flops badly.

The best work I've seen him do although I basically only know him from one television role. After seeing his brilliant performance in this film I can't understand why he's not in more films.If you prefer to see a more serious action film or drama then this movie is not for you. I expected a lousy film and ended up with a delightful romp of quirky characters silly word play and lots and lots of action fun. Good movie!".

Las Vegas looks great and is well used visually as a setting but I already mentioned that this is a professional slick looking production. I found myself almost shouting at the screen to give me something I hadn't seen before. Didn't happen.

Indeed Top Of The World is a very goodlooking movie. The cinematography is great there are some great locations that will make you wonder how the filmmakers got permission to run amuck on and there are some good action sequences.Unfortunately some key parts of the movie are definitely lacking. The characters could have been better written  as it is there is no real character that interests you and makes you hope he or she will prevail. These poorly written characters may be why the acting is not always very enthusiastic by the onceinalifetime cast. Also the various plot twists and character backstabbings become confusing after a while.Not a terrible movie but it's kind of lacking. I would only recommend you watch it if nothing else better is playing on TV.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not a great film a masterpiece of cinemaasart. It is however a wonderful movie that will delight you while you watch it and leave you with many happy musical memories after it has finished.Though the director and star are the same this movie does not resemble Les Choristes. It is instead an homage to French popular music of the 1930s and 1940s. If you don't know that music and the stars who made it famous you'll miss the many references. The movie will still be enjoyable but it won't evoke the memories and pleasures that it would to French viewers over 60.The music most of it original nevertheless comes very close to pastiche of popular numbers from that era. One repeated number is very close to Messager's Clou clou which I think is from his Vronique. The performances and characters also allude to stars of the past though not necessarily in a oneonone way. There is the music hall singer Tony Rossignol whose light lyric tenor recalls Tino Rossi though his Spanish getup and music recalls Luis Mariano. Kad Merad's character starts out doing terrible impressions of animals and Fernandel. He finally has a hit when he starts singing like Charles Trenet. Even though the music is pastiche it is sometimes very catchy and very much caught me up.One of the previous reviewers said that Clovis Cornilliac was made up as Jean Gabin but couldn't reproduce the latter's charisma. I hope he was not meant to recall Gabin because he certainly doesn't. He's pleasant in his role as is the female lead but the star is definitely Gerard Jugniot who gives yet another firstrate performance.This won't make the viewing list for any course on French cinema nor should it. But you'll definitely enjoy it.P.S. I watched this movie again about a year after my first viewing of it. While I still found it enjoyable I realize in rereading my review that it was the last part with all the music that made the strong impression on me. One of the reviews written since my first one notes that the movie might have been more memorable if there had been more music spread throughout it and I agree. The show the company originally stages is bad vaudeville and bad vaudeville numbers have only limited appeal. The subplot concerning Galapiat and the French fascists is somehow disconnected from the rest. Having subsequently seen that same actor BernardPierre Donnadieu in L'affaire Salengro where he played someone on the other side of that fight I realize how much better the issue could have been presented.The film is definitely worth watching and should please most viewers. Grard Jugnot gives yet another very fine very moving performance. I don't know how well it will repay repeated viewings however. I don't know if I would want to watch it myself a third time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Christophe Barratier found box office success in France in 2004 with his cute feelgood story The ChorusLes choristes which was about how a new music teacher brought humanity to a rural French reform school just after WWII by starting a boys' chorus. This also made newcomer JeanBaptiste Maunier into a French teen icon. Faaubourg 36 is a glitzier more musical as in songanddance more nostalgic period drama meant to evoke French films of the Thirties through its focus on a little working class Paris music hall called Chansonia. As the film opens financial problems lead a mean magnate called Galapiat BernardPierre Donnadieu to shut Chansonia down. But it's 1936 and in the spirit of socialist fervor and universal labormanagement strife signaled by the rise of Leon Blum's Popular Front the employees decide to take over Chansonia and run it themselves on no money. This effort is spearheaded by the stage manager Germain Pigoil Gerard Jugnot. Pigoil's life has filled with heartbreak. His dancer wife Viviane Elisabeth Vitali has left him and the state has chosen to take away his beloved accordionist son Jojo Maxence Perrin and send him to live with Viviane.Trying to create triumph out of adversity Pigoil designates an awkward songanddance guy called Jacky Jacquet Kad Merad and a militant and Jewish leftist called Emile Milou Leibovich Clovis Cornillac to reopen the shuttered musical theater in uneasy cooperation with Galapiat. The show must go on! This seems a feeble prospect without financial backing till the three men get lucky when a young newcomer nicknamed Douce Nora Arnezedzer turns up at tryouts. She's talented pretty and clearly a crowdpleaser capable of selling tickets and keeping the place going. Her presence provides further insurance when the local boss turns out to like her.The ups and downs of the plot include depiction of the pervasive antiSemitism of the extreme Right and the exacerbated hostilities between labor and ownership. There are little tragedies but everything is softened and ends happily. Seekers of cinematic edge should look elsewhere. I found it hard to engage with the story because it's too derivative stereotypical and diffuse. Production values are excellent and the music hall performances if sometimes borderline cringeworthy carry through the period flavor. And there are some catchy tunes and sprightly stage turns as well.I saw this film when it was screened last summer at Saul Zaentz Studios in Berkeley by Tom Luddy CoDirector of the Telluride Film Festival and the consensus of those then present seemed to be that 'Paris 36' which has been picked up by Sony Pictures Classics wasn't interesting or unusual enough to show at Telluride.But 'Paris 36' seems likely to do well with the more general US subtitlesfilm audience and makes perfect sense as the gala opening film for the FSLCUniFrance cosponsored RendezVous with French Cinemathough in my opinion last year's first night presentation Claude Lelouch's 'Roman de Gare' made a much more interesting opener.".

Faaubourg 36 is a glitzier more musical as in songanddance more nostalgic period drama meant to evoke French films of the Thirties through its focus on a little working class Paris music hall called Chansonia. As the film opens financial problems lead a mean magnate called Galapiat BernardPierre Donnadieu to shut Chansonia down. But it's 1936 and in the spirit of socialist fervor and universal labormanagement strife signaled by the rise of Leon Blum's Popular Front the employees decide to take over Chansonia and run it themselves on no money. This effort is spearheaded by the stage manager Germain Pigoil Gerard Jugnot. Pigoil's life has filled with heartbreak. His dancer wife Viviane Elisabeth Vitali has left him and the state has chosen to take away his beloved accordionist son Jojo Maxence Perrin and send him to live with Viviane.Trying to create triumph out of adversity Pigoil designates an awkward songanddance guy called Jacky Jacquet Kad Merad and a militant and Jewish leftist called Emile Milou Leibovich Clovis Cornillac to reopen the shuttered musical theater in uneasy cooperation with Galapiat. The show must go on! This seems a feeble prospect without financial backing till the three men get lucky when a young newcomer nicknamed Douce Nora Arnezedzer turns up at tryouts. She's talented pretty and clearly a crowdpleaser capable of selling tickets and keeping the place going. Her presence provides further insurance when the local boss turns out to like her.The ups and downs of the plot include depiction of the pervasive antiSemitism of the extreme Right and the exacerbated hostilities between labor and ownership. There are little tragedies but everything is softened and ends happily. Seekers of cinematic edge should look elsewhere. I found it hard to engage with the story because it's too derivative stereotypical and diffuse. Production values are excellent and the music hall performances if sometimes borderline cringeworthy carry through the period flavor. And there are some catchy tunes and sprightly stage turns as well.I saw this film when it was screened last summer at Saul Zaentz Studios in Berkeley by Tom Luddy CoDirector of the Telluride Film Festival and the consensus of those then present seemed to be that 'Paris 36' which has been picked up by Sony Pictures Classics wasn't interesting or unusual enough to show at Telluride.But 'Paris 36' seems likely to do well with the more general US subtitlesfilm audience and makes perfect sense as the gala opening film for the FSLCUniFrance cosponsored RendezVous with French Cinemathough in my opinion last year's first night presentation Claude Lelouch's 'Roman de Gare' made a much more interesting opener.";

It helps that Nora Arnzeder is so gorgeous and all the actors give strong performances. The story is really a fairy story with a political twist. A small music hall in Paris is forced to close down in 1936. Because this is is the year of the Popular front in France when factory occupations spread across the country the performers decide to take over the theatre and run it themselves. They get an extraordinary stroke of luck when a young girl Douce turns up hoping to get a break in the theatre. Double luck because not only is she a brilliant performer but the local boss fancies her and allows the theatre to stay open. There are some serious themes touched on including the pervasive antiSemitism of the extreme Right at this period but the film is overwhelmingly joyous which is as it should be. The Popular Front didn't happily which was a tragedy for France but this film does as do all good fairy tales.".

Paying loving tribute to the Dream Factory eras of Hollywood and French cinemathe writers cook up a sweet pastichewhere all of the union strikes and the increased appearances of Fascists can't dim the lights of the Chansonia in putting on an escapist show for a troubled public.Reuniting with Barratier Grard Jugnot gives a fantastic everyman performance as Pigoilwhose dry determined wit Pigoil uses for deadpan punchlineswhilst BernardPierre Donnadieu gives Galapiat a slippery menacefake charm. Kicking up the footlights the very pretty Nora Arnezeder gives an exquisite performance as Doucethanks to Arnezeder balancing the mischievous charisma Douce with the fragile love that Douce can barely keep wrapped in the curtains of the Chansonia.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an extremely well made film full of wonderful performances and great direction. The problem is explaining exactly why I enjoyed it isn't all that easymuch of due to the rather unconventional plot.The film begins in 1936. A very ordinary and unassuming looking man named Pigoil is being interrogated by the police about a murder he apparently committed. The rest of the film consists mostly of events from the last half year that led to this killing.Pigoil and his friends work at a theater in Paris that has seen better days. They put on a variety show but the show is abruptly cut short when an evil fascist mobster takes over the place and shuts it downleaving everyone out of work. After months of looking for jobs Pigoil is so frustrated that he decides he and his out of work friends will just squattake over the empty theater and stage a revival. There is A LOT more to the filmincluding several key subplots just too complicated to explain in the review. Oddly however late in the film it suddenly becomes briefly a slightly surreal song and dance numberlike you'd find in a 1940s musical! But once again there is SO MUCH to this film that it's just one you need to see for yourself.Some might no enjoy the film's somewhat episodic style or not understand the historical context for the movie. After all today few would realize that France and much of Europe and even the US were experiencing fascist nationalistic movements. And at the same time Communists were also making inroads with the massesvery much like the crap that was going on in Nazi Germany at the timejust not as organized or militant.Overall this is a cute and wellmade filmone you will enjoy if you just give it a chanceit sneaks up on you!".

Too many characters and subplots  especially those with the French mafia sometimes called apaches were somewhat complicated and puzzling  not meaning that some otherespecially those with communists and fascists were'not at least somewhat naive and clumsy. I recommend this film because there is very good music inside  type of waltz nice decoration of the sets with an exact theater of the 30s Belle Epoque. As for the externals all the way long we see Paris with all those rainywet pavements an eternal snow always a heavy rain it's picturesque attics looking to the sky it's old buildings terraces viewing the Tour Eiffel and as we approach to the end some scenes luxurious as they are evoke Paris rich and fancy apartments at the quartiers chic as they are called. The scenes of the musichall are according to the typical tradition of French cabaret enough satisfying as they recall Lido Follies Bergeres Moulin Rouge cabarets. The singing also refers to top french singers  Edith Piaf Maurice Chevalier Charles Trenet. A very satisfying role and performance is of Pigoil's  musichall manager son  a young boy who plays the accordion in the streets of Paris trying to earn some money with which buys some sausages as a supper offered to his father's lonely drinking  caused by his wife's cruel abandonment for the musichall tenor. I think this film to it's whole was not bad directed with a nice Parisian atmosphere. It will make you surely spend two relaxing and pleasant hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story is a musical drama and comedy that revolves around Chansonia a music hall in Paris Faubourg. On New Year's Eve of 1935 the hall's manager Pigoil loses both his wife and his steady job when he discovers that she is cheating on him and leaving him for another man and the hall gets closed down when the owner commits suicide because he cannot pay his debts to the local mobster Galapiat. Months later our poor protagonist loses his beloved son Jojo as well when the child is given to his ex wife because Pigoil has no job and cannot support the child. This pushes Pigoil to get income by reclaiming Chansonia with the help of Jacky and Milou and the rest of the former employees of the hall. Galapiat decides to give them a month to prove that they can make the place profitable again. Meanwhile a beautiful young woman named Douce crosses their path who is brought on as an announcer but ends up wowing the audience with her voice. She catches the attention of both Galapiat and Milou but instead of offering her heart to either one she runs off to further her career by joining a more promising company. The Chansonia's reopening turns out to be a disaster and this together with no word from his son despite his many letters drives Pigoil to desperation and up a ladder from which he falls off.It's all so depressing but things get better how could it possibly get any worse? when the Radio Man who fears the outside world and only stays inside his house hears Douce's voice and realizes that she is the daughter of the woman he was in love with the woman who used to be Chansonia's star whom he composed songs for. So he runs after Douche and convinces her to come back and with his new songs make Chansonia grand again. Meanwhile Pigoil has not died from the fall but only injured his foot. He goes home to find that his landlord was claiming all his possessions. He prays them spare his son's accordion and brings it to him. But Jojo is not home so he just leaves it on the boy's bed pausing to inhale his son's fragrance from the shirt on his bed. Much later Jojo inadvertently discovers that his mother had been hiding his and his father's letters. Back home Pigoil is roused from his furnitureless apartment by a serenade below his window  his beloved Jojo had come home to play him a tune on his accordion.The Chansonia rises from its ashes and they make enough money to buy it back but things go awry with the GalapiatDoucheMilou love triangle. Two innocent characters become victims of the crossfire. When Galapiat discovers that Douche and Milou are lovers he sends his henchmen to kill Milou and steal his money but they end up killing Jacky. When Milou runs after Galapiat for this Pigoil trails after him and ends up killing Galapiat. He ends up behind bars. Ten years later he is released and he walks towards a jampacked Chansonia. He is about to ask the guard to tell the star Jo Pigoil that his father has arrived but he changes his mind and tells the guard nevermind let him play instead. He sits outside the music hall and listens to his boy making both their dreams come true for them. A somewhat sad yet still happy ending.It was a long movie with many subplots but it was entertaining all throughout despite the sadness. My favorite subplot was the main one about the father and son's great love for each other. It broke my heart to see Pigoil put Jojo's shirt to his face like he really wanted to embrace his missing son and my heart got so overwhelmed at the moment he crept back to the window when he realized that it was Jojo playing the accordion. I was also touched by the radio man's love for Rose. I shed tears for those scenes and a few more but it was totally worth it. Tres magnifique! I am so watching more French films after this.".

With palpable outrage De Antonio Point of Order Underground assembles period interviews with journalists politicians and key military personnel and international newsreel and archival footage to create a scathing chronicle of America's escalating involvement in this divisive conflict. The savage and horrific images speak for themselves in perhaps the most controversial film of de Antonio's career and the film he cites as his personal favorite.";

Facts that have since been revealed in declassified documents or candid confessions of top tier insiders. This is particularly true about JFK and the blinding light of the post assassination mythology that made even down to earth journalists reluctant to attribute blame to Kennedy. So my tip is when you watch try and see through their reluctance to blame and willingness to imply and believe a wonderful world that would have been...if only on that day in Dallas...remember there was no Vietnamese conflict prior to FrancoAmerican imperial interference in Viet Nam. It was not a Vietnamese made conflict it was an imperial one made by external hands.".

	schema:reviewBody "Emile de Antonio was the godfather of independent political documentaries. His films all deal with the power structures of Cold War America and all have Maxist overtones.In the Year of the Pig is regarded as Antonio's best film. A Michael Moore styled attack on America's foreign policy and propaganda campaigns during the Vietnam War the film was funded by the French and a group of Marxist rebels.Antonio's ironic use of music would be emulated decades later in films like Born on the Fourth of July Coming Home and countless other shallow Vietnam war flicks. The film asserts that Vietnam was always a single country explained how the United States refused to recognise the Geneva Accords which facilitated NorthSouth unification goes to lengths to highlight the fact that the US treated the conflict as a proxy war against Communism andor egalitarian movements details the various puppet leaders supported by Washington documents the United States' attempts to prevent local elections and provides insight into the government's increasing control of the media.Upon release Pigs was greeted with hostility with numerous bomb threats directed against theatres which promised to show it. Today the film is mostly interesting for the way it foreshadows the Iraq war.Both the Iraq and Vietnam wars were of course founded on lies. In Vietnam the original lie was that a poor nation of preindustrial age farmers posed a threat to the mightiest empire the world had ever known. The Gulf of Tonkin hoax was the manufactured excuse to jump in with all guns blazing and the Pentagon Papers were the irrefutable proof used to back up all US military decisions.With Iraq the same thing happened. The 911 attack became the new flashpoint when in fact it had nothing to do with Iraq. CIA papers were then used to convince populaces that a band of lowtech Arabs possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction. The truth was these weapons didn't exist and what primitive weapons they did have were sold to them by the US in the first place. Not to mention that Saddam Hussein was for several decades a Western puppet financed specifically and encouraged to wage war on Iran so that the West could control their regional interests after the loss of Shah Reza. Like Vietnam Washington then began to disseminate a constant supply of buzzwords Al Qaeda terrorists 911 global terror. The message was clear. Like Vietnam we had to ship our boys over and clean up the place. In Vietnam the US broke the Geneva convention whilst in Iraq the US broke the UN resolution. The world said stop but Uncle Sam went on in anyway. Their laws aren't our laws.Both wars quickly became longterm guerrilla conflicts a style of combat which American forces were untrained for. Both wars also used the fictions of democracy and freedoms to pacify the American public. In Vietnam democracy took the form of a gang of wealthy Catholic dictators running a country of poor rural Buddhist peasants. In truth it was a proxy war against the Soviets. The US wanted to expand the global market the Vietnamese wanted land reforms and self determination. This is not an isolated incident. Over the past century the US has invaded or meddled in over 70 countries across Asia and Latin America in each case brutally taking down leftleaning or egalitarian populace movements. To do this they supply or support fanatical rebels. When these rebels get in power the West is given resource rights and an excuse to invade at any moment as their puppet can easily be demonized in the future. If the leftleaning movement gets into power the West's approach alters. The country is isolated embargoed strangled and demonized. See Iran Cuba and Korea. Back to Vietnam After the US had its puppet Diem? assassinated in 1963 it took two years and seven different governments before a suitably brutal but still lovable figurehead could be found.A similar situation occurred in Iraq a governing council of USappointed stooges pretends to represent Iraqi interests by handing over almost all industries to large U.S. corporations all of which just happen to be donors to the Republican party.Both wars were also against victim nations already scarred by Colonial domination. Vietnam was dominated for over a century by the French Japanese and Americans. Likewise Iraq bears the scars of a repressive colonial legacy. It was created in the aftermath of World War I literally carved out of the sand by the British for the sole purpose of controlling the world's oil supply. The US helped Saddam Hussein's party overthrow the government in 1963 but its purposes were the same as the British's to control oil.Finally and most importantly both wars are an attempt by the USA to maintain world power by containing the growth of rival ideologies. Vietnam Afganistan Korea and WW2 were all proxy wars with Russia. Had Vietnam fallen fears were that communism would spread to Cambodia India and China. In Iraq the grand strategy is global hegemony. Iraq is simply the first tactical step in the Neoconservative vision. With a constant presence in the Middle East Iran and Saudi Arabia will be kept at bay and the US will be free to project its military might throughout the Persian Gulf site of 55 percent of the world's oil.Antonio's documentary doesn't go into all these details but it does break the Vietnam conflict down clearly and highlights exactly what and why things happened. This was the first real independent political documentary and so its sort of become a classic of its genre. But today its real value is more in how it relates to our current world. It's a mirror for our times.8.510  Note that Francis Ford Coppola freely admits that he ripped Apocalypse Now's Wagner sequence from Antonio's Pig.".

But the movie's success is less sterling in HK where it just opens presumably because moviegoers here typecast it with yetanothermelodramaticTaiwanesefilm association and one with GLBTtheme at that which is a shame for it deserves a wider audience even as it's one that isn't without minor flaws of its own as befits the fate of most comingofage films helmed by relatively young directors in this case Leste CHEN all of 25.The plot is decidedly simple and the narrative mostly linear tracking the friendship and love of its 3 main protagonists best friends Jonathan Shane and Carrie played by Kate Yeung who shines in limited screen time in their youth from age 11 in a school in rural Hualian in 1991 to age 18 1998 to the college year in Taipei 2005 with all of their ensuing majesty glory anxiety complicity confusion pang angst and a dreamy quality thrown in. The film will benefit from some minor editing for a more even pace. Original music by Jeffrey CHENG is intrusive at best. These minor quibbles aside cinematographer Charlie LAM's rendering of the rural locations is thing of pure magic and the theme song by Ah Xin of the May Day rock band fame blends in magnificently with the direction to which the film eventually takes. A friend asked if this is a tearjerker to avoid at all costs. My answer to which is that hot and bitter tears may flow not necessarily because of the inherent sadness of the human conditions but may be because it deepens our understanding of those who are perceived to be different and living on the fringe. And if the measure of a film lies in whether the audience connects with the characters towards the end and whether it leaves you with the sudden urge to be young and fell in love all over again then it isn't to be missed and so it seems Eternal Summer is a welcome addition to the growing list of Taiwanese films with GLBT content.

The style of the film allows a wide audience to appreciate the sexual challenges of teenagers and understand the need for finding love and acceptance in a world at times too busy to care.The story begins in grade school where Jonathan Kang Bryant Chang is a gifted student asked to 'supervise' another young boy in his class Shane Yu the dazzlingly gifted young actor Joseph Chang who has an apparent learning disorderattention deficit.

Shane gradually moves into Jonathan's position as Carrie's physical companion and the resulting triangle results in confessions and incidents that allow each of the three involved young people to grow and understand the spectrum of love.The story is captured with exceptionally beautiful cinematic effects by cinematographer Charlie Lam and the atmosphere of play and passion is enhanced by the musical score by Jeffrey Cheng. Yet it is the sensitive direction by Leste Chen that encourages the three superb young actors to become immersed in their roles. Chen knows when to say enough the sex scenes are sensual and suggestive without even approaching an R rating and when to allow scenes of quiet and eye contact to carry the drama. This is a very fine film that deserves a wide audience both young and old. Highly recommended. In Mandarin with English subtitles. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " a search for teen companionship";
	schema:reviewBody "Eternal Summer is essentially about the innately gregarious nature of human existence that desire of each and every human being to have companionship. Although this topic is certainly not new to cinema it is portrayed in an original artistic and poignant manner in this film directed by Leste Chen. In this simple yet touching story three teenagers Jonathan Shane and Carrie are thrown into a tumultuous love triangle out of which they each learn that no one should ever have to be lonely. The first character Jonathan is a hardworking and studious student. One day while in grade school he is asked by the teacher to befriend the rebellious Shane in hopes that Jonathan's obedient nature will rub off on Shane. This unlikely friendship goes well into their teen years as Jonathan remains the diligent and introverted individual while Shane is still the outspoken and oftentimes boorish individual now redirecting that hyperactive energy to sports. During these years Jonathan has developed a secret homosexual crush on his best friend Shane. Jonathan himself does not realize this until a new girl at school Carrie starts to take a liking to him. After confessing to Carrie that he is gay and in love with his best friend he still remains friends with Carrie the only outside keeper of his biggest secret. The roles that Shane and Carrie play in Jonathan's life have now changed Carrie is now Jonathan's true best friend while Shane is Jonathan's desired lover. In spite of this Jonathan keeps this love wellhidden and does not act on it. His overwhelming feelings for Shane do not begin to take the best of him until he realizes that Carrie his true best friend is now dating Shane. It is now that he realizes that he cannot ever just be friends with Shane.Meanwhile Shane sees Jonathan throughout the entire story as his best friend the only friend he had as a rebellious young boy. Shane's greatest fear is suffering from the loneliness that characterized his childhood before having met Jonathan and he never wants to return to that dark place ever again. When Jonathan tells Shane that he never wanted to be his friend Shane's emotions are utterly crushed and in a lastditch effort to salvage their invaluable friendship Shane gives Jonathan what Jonathan has probably been fantasizing about his entire life one night of intimate unification. For the desperate Shane this is the only physical way he can show his best friend how much he does not want to lose their friendship. Meanwhile Shane does not want to lose his love either Carrie. Although the love story between Shane and Carrie was terribly underdeveloped Shane admits that he cannot function without Carrie his love or Jonathan his best friend. The third character in this love triangle is Carrie. A new transfer student from Hong Kong Carrie initially has her eyes set on Jonathan the sweet guy at school with boyish good looks. When she discovers that she cannot have him she shifts her eyes to Shane. In a way Shane is Carrie's replacementJonathan. Knowing that she cannot have Jonathan as her lover she settles for having Jonathan as her best friend and Shane as her lover. Being with Shane Jonathan's best friend seems to be the closest Carrie will ever have to being Jonathan's lover. This story of the quest for teenage companionship was very richlycolored and profoundly presented. However a major defect of this film was the lack of believability of how Jonathan could have truly loved Shane for any reason other than Shane's good looks or his athletic body. Shane's treatment of Jonathan was not particularly likable. For example Shane causes Jonathan's grades to slip by distracting him when he tries to study. Even when Jonathan directly asks Shane to let him be Shane disregards his alleged best friend's request and continues to disturb him. Furthermore Shane is rather bossy and overbearing. He orders Jonathan to eat with him numerous times to keep him company and when Jonathan does not fulfill this obligation Shane feels the need to punish his friend by making it difficult for him to study. It is truly hard to understand how Jonathan could have really liked Shane for any reason other than a superficial one. A second major blemish of the film was the seemingly illogical actions of Shane. Shane sees Jonathan as his best friend without whom he cannot live. Yet he is willing to jeopardize that friendship by actively pursuing Carrie after thinking that she and Jonathan recently broke up. Good friends do not normally date each other's ex's especially so soon after a breakup. Furthermore he sees Carrie behind Jonathan's back and surprisingly it is Carrie who knows Jonathan less well who suggests that they come clean to Jonathan about their relationship. Furthermore when he is losing Jonathan Shane decides to sleep with him in a final effort to save their friendship. Although I admit that this scene was indeed an enjoyable one it is outright incongruous for a friend to sleep with another friend to save a friendship. Normally friends use oral communication rather than intimately physical communication to save a diminishing friendship. Unless he actually had intimate feelings for Jonathan sleeping with him only strains the friendship further and makes it more difficult for them to just be friends again.All three characters desire someone to fill the role of best friend and someone else to fill the role of lover. Through their teen quests to find and keep friendships whether romantic or not the film shows us that companionship is a deepseated part of human existence that everyone needs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eternal summer is a sweet and bitter love triangle between guys and one girl. Johnathan the shy and reserved fell for his best friend Shane the outgoing and sporty. Carrie who initially fell for Johnathan then became in love with Shane. Not sure if Carrie was really in love with Shane or just used Shane to get close to Johnathan. It is very hard to believe that Shane had spent one intimate night with Johnathan and still see him as his best friend. I think Shane also has some feelings for Johnathan more than friendship. It seems to me that these two developed feelings for each other over the long period of their friendship. Shane is prob. bisexual but he probably doesn't realize it. The film has a lot of implications that Shane seems confused lost and even edgy without Johnathan around more so than without Carrie. There is no explicit ending for these 3 at the end. I can understand how Johnathan felt when he found out his best friend had a girlfriend the hurt and rejection he felt yet he couldn't tell the others. I can understand how Shane felt when he could only watch Shane fall asleep and control his reactions all because this is not acceptable by the society and not knowing how Shane felt about him. At the end Shane said that he is really lonely and sees Johnathan as his truly best friend. I really have doubts about what he said. I really believe that Shane sees Johnathan more than a best friend but he is prob. in denial and confused too.. Only if Johnathan can ask Shane if Shane loves him too... The music is great very touching. Both Johnathan and Shane gave strong performances. Carrie is good too but didn't shine as the other two. I wish the movie has a really ending..".

	schema:reviewBody "Sheng Xia Guang Nian tells the tale of two guys and one girl's love triangle relationship. From when they were in grade school to them in high school waiting to enter university. Kang Zheng Xing as a grade schooler was a good student obedient and hardworking he was made by the teacher to be Yu Shou Heng's partner and from then his studies was affected. Still he was mild mannered and nice but afflicted with emotional upheavals.Yu Shou Heng was a boy with ADD very mischievous very naughty. He didn't have any friends and Kang Zheng Xing became his first friend. Yu Shou Heng matured over the years to become the basketball team's star player in high school and even made it into the university team. He's tall dark athletic outspoken and provides a good contrast to the mild Kang Zheng Xing. Despite all that the two of them remained close friends going to and from school together.I really like the parts which Yu Shou Heng would pick up Kang Zheng Xing in his bicycle and his motor scooter later. It's like the standard recurring motif in all films of this genre. Ya it reminded me of Cardcaptor Sakura where Touya would never fail to pick up Yukito to go to school together.Du Hui Jia was a girl from Hong Kong who came between the two friends. She was first Kang Zheng Xing's girlfriend after they got to know each other from the newspaper club then they skipped classes to go up Taipei together and even checked into a motel. But after Kang Zheng Xing rejected her she got to know Yu Shou Heng better and after a few encounters and with Yu Shou Heng making into university the two of them got together behind Kang Zheng Xing's back.I think Du Hui Jia was portrayed very well seeing her torn between the two guys and her knowing Kang Zheng Xing's secret yet not being able to do anything and even coming between the two guys it's quite difficult. Yu Shou Heng was quite evenly portrayed but I thought that he became very stereotypical of all shounenai couples which made his feelings for Du Hui Jia seem rather awkward. Special mention is reserved for Kang Zheng Xing. His internal emotional struggles was so well portrayed that I really felt so deeply for him. That actor Bryant Chang won the Golden Horse award as New Performer for this role. That explains the well portrayal of Kang Zheng Xing.The film was quite slow paced which allowed for the emotional development of the various characters I liked it. Though sometimes it can fall a bit too melodramatic but it's not really that indulgent. The story is sad but not to cryingwailing kind of sad it's the sadness that hits you in the guts and make you think about the characters whole night long kind of sad.With the two guys one girl theme I'd first think of comparing it with Fleeing by Night only that Eternal Summer is more explicit in the expression of emotions of love. It's not like I don't like sex scenes but somehow I prefer more implicit relationships. It's like preferring shounenai to yaoi.".

The rating no one should get worked up over since they seem to be dishing them out like there's no tomorrow nowadays with Little regard for actual content. In Eternal Summer's case it's likely due to a super short scene depicting the two male leads naked in bed and doing the nasty something even the hohum Brokeback Mountain managed to get right with less fuss.No Eternal Summer dances around its main point to an exaggerated degree in the end causing us to wonder what that point was meant to be to begin with. Rather what's so special about this one is its membership in a very exclusive club of movies with enough projectile velocity to break free of Taiwan where it was made. Taiwanese cinema has become rare something we lament. For that only Eternal Summer demands your support.It unfortunately possesses scant few other redeeming traits. Viewers can see the whole gist of it from the getgo and in its arsenal of tricks exist no better weapons than an ageold threesome of young and restless characters in search of definition. But they hardly do much to find meaning which is likely a stilllife phenomenon someone like Taiwanbased mastermind director Hou Hsiao Hsien would have worked wonders with. But trusted to 25 yearold Leste Chen The Heirloom it all comes across flat and uncompelling. Never mind young auteurs like that require our attention and moviegoing prowess so we're willing to take an uninspired story as part of proceedings.Two additional newcomers do the main two protagonists rebellious James Deantype Shane by the darkly alluring Joseph Chang and geeky lost soul Jonathan via Bryant Chang. Their characters meet as young boys at a rural school when Jonathan is asked by a teacher to buddy up with attentionlacking Shane as a means of getting the weaker student into the swing of things and the rest constitutes a very short history.Years later they're best friends almost inseparable and with an undercurrent of attraction not entirely par for the course although that part is left for audiences to quite easily deduce on their own.Into the mix is then thrown Carrie played by sexy tomboy Kate Yeung who we've before seen in Mighty Baby and The Eye 10. This young lady gives mid90's Liv Tyler as serious a marathon for her money as can be arranged easily stealing the show with her range of facial expressions and sincere almost jocular attitude. She's largely wasted in Eternal Summer with a skillset far more suited to the sarcastic niche filled by fellow youthful lovelies like Cherrie Ying.All this takes place as the trio gets ready to finish high school and move on to college and the plot follows them as they do so. One neat aspect of Eternal Summer is how it effectively excludes everyone else forcing the story to highlight only the three as if they were the epitome of iconoclastic social angst. This does work but lacks the power and impact derived from a truly interesting story to back it up.Love and emotion get their two cents in as Jonathan and Carrie begin a timid exploration into the world of lust something merely glanced in a missed opportunity transpiring at a Taipei love hotel. Then the balance of pheromone power shifts to see Carrie and Shane give it a go with friendship remaining at the forefront all along.Sure there's a desire to find out more about what drives people as they discover new ground in themselves. And the rustic fauxretro feel looks like they were indeed going for a late 90's setting helps in avoiding gimmicks and other lifestyle distractions. Yet Eternal Summer goes by unnoticed almost and by the time its socalled sensational climax arrives the average viewer would be challenged to do more than tick a box on a checklist. Yes it's still not a commonplace theme in cinema overall let alone Asian cinema but so much more could have been done with it.Seriously given a more mature crew at the wheel Eternal Summer could have been deftly transformed into something to talk about for a while as a symbol of encompassing gay themes or at the very least as a brainboggling surreal love flick in the vein of 1999's Where Have all The Flowers Gone with Zhou Xun.Bereft of potency Eternal Summer inhabits a perpetual limbo state populated by movies that look good the Taiwan countryside makes for some lush environs are capably written on paper and could have been infinitely more aggressive in going about their business but didn't.That's a shame and not the type of shot in the arm Taiwan's filmmakers need.

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews Eternal Summer";
	schema:reviewBody "A brave effort Director Leste Chen has ventured into an unlikely genre with a brave heart but the results are another matter. It is a film that attempts to be compelling emotional and consequential but ultimately it fails to connect with the audience. The film itself is like a beautiful image filled with daring performances outstanding direction and lighting but somehow it falls short and perhaps ending up being quite lacking. Putting together two relatively unknown male leads enhance the credibility of the film by being more believable and surprisingly they handed their respective roles with suitable bravery and emotionally performed. Coming from the lush of fame from the arty 203040 Kate Yeung is suitably nature and a potential filled performance worthy of noting.The movie goes like this The film opens with elementary school kid Jonathan Bryant Chang ordered by the teacher to befriend his classmate Shane Joseph Chang. Since then they have shared every episode in their lives until Carrie Kate Yeung becomes their high school classmate...It is still a mystery as to the prime reason why the movie never seem to connect to Neo perhaps it is the subject matter it is dealing with but the film is ultimately distant and leaving far too many stones unturned in the process. Some twists like the controversial sex scene is far more shocking and brave than actually affecting and connecting. It is probably safe to say that the script is really a let down as everything else seems like the product of good cinema. There is no doubt that the filmmaker here is daring and is not afraid to expose edgy issues and there are even scenes that reminds us of a far superior Wong Kar Wai's film  Happy Together. Unfortunately this flick never reaches those heights and the effect is more like experimental cinema than actual accomplished cinema.Still with all the criticisms the performances of the trio is without doubt the core saviour for the film as they are able to create believable characters and act beyond the material they are given. Byrant Chang handles his role in an outright sympathetic manner with his heart torn between his love for his best friend and his duty to maintain his friendship. He is expressive and subtle at times creating a performance that is worthy of some recognition. Likewise Joseph Chang performs extremely well in a complex role but in a way his performance may well be enhanced by the sudden shocks within the scripts rather than his actual performance. Nonetheless he remains a fine young talent. Of the trio Kate Yeung is given the filling parts or perhaps what Neo calls a paper thin role but somehow Yeung is able to act beyond her material and resulting in the most natural performance of the trio. She is a bright young talent and despite not being an outright beauty her talents by far outweigh that minor physical flaw.All in all Eternal Summer is by no means a bad movie and in fact it almost has all the ingredients to set it up as an outright award winning arty film. Unfortunately the film failed to connect and affect to the audience's emotions resulting in a finale that is more emotional and tense for the people on screen rather than the ones looking on. It is ultimately a trying and brave effort and for that alone it is worthy of giving some sort of credit to. Nonetheless it is an interesting look into the lives of three tormented souls and the daring performances are alone worthy of a pat on the shoulders for their efforts Neo 2006I rate it 7.510.www.thehkneo.com".

	onyx:emotionText "A brave effort Director Leste Chen has ventured into an unlikely genre with a brave heart but the results are another matter. It is a film that attempts to be compelling emotional and consequential but ultimately it fails to connect with the audience. The film itself is like a beautiful image filled with daring performances outstanding direction and lighting but somehow it falls short and perhaps ending up being quite lacking. Putting together two relatively unknown male leads enhance the credibility of the film by being more believable and surprisingly they handed their respective roles with suitable bravery and emotionally performed. Coming from the lush of fame from the arty 203040 Kate Yeung is suitably nature and a potential filled performance worthy of noting.The movie goes like this The film opens with elementary school kid Jonathan Bryant Chang ordered by the teacher to befriend his classmate Shane Joseph Chang. Since then they have shared every episode in their lives until Carrie Kate Yeung becomes their high school classmate...It is still a mystery as to the prime reason why the movie never seem to connect to Neo perhaps it is the subject matter it is dealing with but the film is ultimately distant and leaving far too many stones unturned in the process. Some twists like the controversial sex scene is far more shocking and brave than actually affecting and connecting. It is probably safe to say that the script is really a let down as everything else seems like the product of good cinema.

The music is rather syrupy which lends to the film's tear jerking nature. But the story is very well done and the performances of the leads are very strong and they do have very good chemistry. I'm not sure that the sex scene really made a whole lot of sense to me and there seemed to be a fair amount edited out of the story which might have made the film better and fleshed things out a bit more. I think the characters are rather relatable for most gay guys. I certainly had my share of straight friends who I was in love with over the years. And I liked the way the story is told from the beginning of their friendship. I wasn't sure if Carrie was supposed to be the same girl as the one at the beginning who gets her hair cut by Shane. Definitely worth seeing.".

There are times when the way the camera moves through a scene is so fascinating so evocative and sensual that I neither know nor care what the actors are doing  which is a good thing because they're rarely doing anything worth watching.The girl and the boy who plays Shane are pretty good sometimes and the boy who plays Jonathan is great in the very first scene when he looks into the camera and smiles before leading us out the door and into the past  his only smile in the whole movie.The mostly piano score stays comfortably in the background except in crucial scenes when it swells intrusively and annoyingly in its attempt to force us to be caught up in the drama we see and succeeds only in detracting from it.The big sex scene is sweet enough but it's about as believable as if Bruce Willis and Harrison Ford did one. Some straight actors can pull it off  better than many gay actors  but not these two.I like the slightly ambiguous ending but the fact that the whole movie is a flashback means the first scene helps a lot in tying the end together. The story is unusual enough that it could have been interesting and it actually is sometimes but not often enough to carry the movie.There's nothing new about a gay boy in love with his straight best friend or about a girl who's in love with the gay but settles for the straight. What IS new is the marvelous extent to which this straight guy is willing to become whatever his friend needs him to be  without at all compromising his strong sense of himself  and with no resentment at all no holding his nose while he does something that disgusts him no hint of martyrdom  only love.That alone makes this movie  despite its many weaknesses and faults  very special. If there actually were even one such straight man on the face of the earth this world would be a better place.The DVD cover is misleading. There is no such scene in the movie with the three of them lying entwined together in the sand or anywhere else  not even in the deleted scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really cannot praise Local Hero enough it is simply one of the best films ever made and certainly without any shadow of doubt my number one favourite movie of all time. Fans of Ealing Comedy will relate to this film instantly. The humour is extremely subtle going for the quirkiness of human behaviour rather than prefabricated bellylaughs. For example the two farmers arguing which is the better vehicle for transporting winter lambs Massarati or Rolls Royce. And the African preacher who has to explain that he's not Scottish either but still has the surname McPhearson. At first glance the story of Local Hero is hardly one which would engage fevered interest. A big Texan oil company wants to buy a huge chunk of Scottish coastline and a representative is flown over to close the deal. Chosen because it's thought he is of Scottish origin McIntyre Peter Riegert complains to a colleague that he could do the deal over the wires in an afternoon and that his parents chose the surname when they got off the boat from Hungary because they thought it sounded American. But what grabs the attention and is the fundamental beauty to the film is Mac's journey from a materialistic Texan yuppie to one who falls in love with the simple things of life and by the film's end when Mac returns home has been changed forever by his trip.Mac plays his part very well from a character who depends on his expensive suits his Porsche quad hifi and personal health insurance to one who collects shells on a Scottish beach and drinks 40 yearold malt whisky in the bosom of the small community that he suddenly finds himself a part of. Burt Lancaster plays the wonderfully eccentric oil company CEO who is more concerned with dicovering a comet of his own than making millions of dollars. Then of course there is Denis Lawson as the estate agent  taxi driver  hotelier Peter Capaldi as the bungling company trainee and Jenny Seagrove who prefers being underwater to life on land along with all the various yokels and locals that give this film its very unique charm. And the plot twist? A fabulously subtle oneliner that gives the whole thing away. But of course one cannot talk about this movie without mentioning the soundtrack. Many years ago I felt compelled to watch this movie because being a big Dire Straits fan at the time i had the soundtrack and was instantly hooked. Mark Knopfler does sterling work in adding musical flavour to the film. Lazy acoustic guitars match perfectly the breathtaking scenary that the director Bill Forsyth has captured of the Scottish Highlands. Overall I would have no hesitation in recommending this film to people. Every recommendation I've made has been met with the same response a gem of a movie that simply cannot be ignored. Local Hero will be my own personal number one for ever!1010".

A big Texan oil company wants to buy a huge chunk of Scottish coastline and a representative is flown over to close the deal. Chosen because it's thought he is of Scottish origin McIntyre Peter Riegert complains to a colleague that he could do the deal over the wires in an afternoon and that his parents chose the surname when they got off the boat from Hungary because they thought it sounded American. But what grabs the attention and is the fundamental beauty to the film is Mac's journey from a materialistic Texan yuppie to one who falls in love with the simple things of life and by the film's end when Mac returns home has been changed forever by his trip.Mac plays his part very well from a character who depends on his expensive suits his Porsche quad hifi and personal health insurance to one who collects shells on a Scottish beach and drinks 40 yearold malt whisky in the bosom of the small community that he suddenly finds himself a part of. Burt Lancaster plays the wonderfully eccentric oil company CEO who is more concerned with dicovering a comet of his own than making millions of dollars. Then of course there is Denis Lawson as the estate agent  taxi driver  hotelier Peter Capaldi as the bungling company trainee and Jenny Seagrove who prefers being underwater to life on land along with all the various yokels and locals that give this film its very unique charm. And the plot twist? A fabulously subtle oneliner that gives the whole thing away. But of course one cannot talk about this movie without mentioning the soundtrack. Many years ago I felt compelled to watch this movie because being a big Dire Straits fan at the time i had the soundtrack and was instantly hooked. Mark Knopfler does sterling work in adding musical flavour to the film. Lazy acoustic guitars match perfectly the breathtaking scenary that the director Bill Forsyth has captured of the Scottish Highlands. Overall I would have no hesitation in recommending this film to people. Every recommendation I've made has been met with the same response a gem of a movie that simply cannot be ignored. Local Hero will be my own personal number one for ever!1010";

Bill Forsyth cares about every character that inhabits his film and in a very gentle openhanded way he seems to want to share his characters with the audience so that the audience might see the best of themselves in some aspect of those characters.I can understand why Forsyth didn't develop into a major moviemaker in Hollywood in the same way that I can understand why some people find this movie boring.

A hopeful end to be sure.  I used to wonder about the casting of Peter Riegert in the lead I think Dennis Leary would have been perfect in this role.  But after several viewings I have grown to like and appreciate Riegert's performance very much.  I'm one of those superficial twits who perfer goodlooking leading men like Sam Neill and Brad Pitt.

There is subtle humor gorgeous scenery a great story and memorable characters.  When the TV show Northern Exposure came out I was amazed at the similarities between the show and Local Hero. An American professional accustomed to fast paced city living finds himself in a quirky town in the middle of nowhere.  Even the resemblance of Peter Riegert playing Mac and Rob Morrow as Fleishman is striking.  But when the episode of Northern Exposure aired where the famous Russian comes to town and performs in the local bar while the female store owner swoons I nearly laughed myself off the couch.  There was an identical scene in Local Hero. Local Hero captured a certain magic and mystery haunting and poetic while remaining lighthearted and warming.  One could not blame the creators of Northern Exposure for wanting to capture that same magic but they could have been just a little more original.  I love Bill Forsythe's movies.

	schema:reviewBody "Oddly enough from the comments thus far about the film nobody as in not a single viewer has commented on the absolutely stunning performance by Peter Riegert. It is the best of right on low key performances of all time if somebody told him that leprosy had just overtaken the island he might have batted one eyelash. Yet no matter how low the key it is never off key. And yes yes it has a lot of other things going for it but nothing like his performance. Somehow the director got the right guy for the job so much so that it is impossible to conjure anybody in all Hollywood that could have done so well. Moreover the movie moves about him so tightly and he takes the load so effortlessly it is almost not surprising that nobody has noticed just how good he is here. In fact were there even a smidgen of fireworks from him this would just be another movie. Time is gonna treat this film very well when ninety percent of most films are forgotten this will continue to rise in the ranks of the remembered.".

It is the best of right on low key performances of all time if somebody told him that leprosy had just overtaken the island he might have batted one eyelash. Yet no matter how low the key it is never off key. And yes yes it has a lot of other things going for it but nothing like his performance.

At every line of dialog I expect the trite or clich and in every instance I am subtly drawn into the filmmaker's viewpoint and away from my own cynical sarcastic pessimistic viewpoint. I laugh at myself and my expectations and I am charmed into experiencing the many dimensions of human character that I find in this film.I am thrilled to find so many others who appreciate this film. It is one of the few videos that I own. I watch it every year and I have never been dissatisfied with it. And for the record I am female.When I toured England Wales and Scotland I was completely unprepared for the beauty and magic of Scotland. This film has become more dear to me since then because it reminds me of Scotland. The scenery is beautiful but always secondary to the human landscape.The underlying strength of the film is that all the human beings in their unexpectedness and diversity are equal players in the tapestry of the whole. Many of the value systems of humanity today are portrayed in one village. But the happiest person is the one who works for his living by harvesting the gifts washed up by the sea. And in his shadow persona pockets all the fresh baked goods at the ceilidh  Now I live in Kansas City and view life from the heartland. I come away from Local Hero wanting to view humanity from the heart not from the trite or the clich or my prejudices. This is quite an accomplishment for a film.Added in 2013 After 30 years I still love this film. I finally know what the final scene means to me  but I will let you figure that out for yourself. I finally appreciate consciously the soundtrack  which was just part of the whole for the first 20 viewings of the film. I am still charmed by this beautiful magical subtle work of art. I hope you like it too!".

But then unlike some of those who have criticised it I don't feel any burning desire to take the film apart and put the bits under the microscope. All I know is that it makes me feel great like a walk in the countryside on a bright spring morning. It makes me feel happy positive warm and hopeful. It makes me love the world even more than before  I want to rush out into the street and invite passersby in for a cup of tea. It hits the soulbutton that as an atheist I shouldn't have. So who cares about the plot or the pace or where it's going? It touches me ... in the same way that it's obviously affected a great many other people.Yup I reckon it'll be my favourite film of all time.Mind you I did think the casting was perhaps a bit....".

Just the best casting ever as is usually the case with British movies I find.  Peter Riegert is great as always in the lead role of a successful executive who really feels a sense of emptiness until he meets the eccentric townspeople.  Burt Lancaster is fine as the also eccentric stargazing CEO of Knox Oil and Gas who ends up in the village himself and under the spell of the place and it's people. Just a wonderful flick.

The film still manages to capture a sense of the otherworldly without being off putting or quirky for quirkies sake. It is I think a subtle but persuasive look at values appropriate for the beginning of the excessive 80's and the equally acquisitive 90's and beyond and what truly brings pleasure and meaning to our daily lives. Money and material wealth aren't disparaged but are put into the context of friends home and the simple pleasure of looking up at the sky and seeing wonders.

The landscape is infernal from the Breughelesque sets to the leering henchman to the blasted mountains. For his enemies he has two barrels of a shotgun and no pity. The hell is as much in his mind as it is in the town he rides into. He is a man with no place ideology or purpose. Unlike Eastwood's characters in the dollars trilogy who are without history or neuroses with Nero as Keoma we have a profound psychological portrait of a man in spiritual agony on the road to obliteration and selfimmolation.The scenario is also hellish we have a town and a region that has been taken over by a warlord. He and his henchman block access from and to the outside world. The townsfolk are all infected with a plague and rather than given access to medical aid they are put in a concentration camp and forced to mine for silver or simply murdered. The town is left to the henchmen and their trollops. This for me is very unlike a western in the traditional American sense. In the American western there are always the upright people of the town to appeal to there is a sheriff or as a last resort the cavalry. People may be run off their land or be claimjumped but they are never forced into slave labour.What we have in Keoma and in similar movies such as Django and Django Strikes Again is a fundamentally African western which is probably why Spaghetti goes down so well on that continent. The town in Keoma is more reminiscent of somewhere in Sierra Leone than the Sierra Nevada. There is total brutal oppression of the populace. There is a reckless attitude towards the value of life. Keoma is likewise a more fitting hero for such a landscape he is almost a Christlike figure in the sense that he is betrayed or deserted by everyone in this movie his family the oppressed and the liberated. When Keoma is crucified on a wagonwheel the artisans politicos henchmen and whores celebrate a change of leadership in the saloon that was entirely down to him. He is constantly grimy his hair is totally overgrown he is hirsute sweaty and wears no overshirt. Seeing him shove his pistol down the back of his trousers against his bare back will make the ladies a little queasy.This movie has a very dreamlike atmosphere. The reason for this is that there is no real cohesive plot. Apparently Castellari threw the script in the bin immediately prior to shooting and adopted a completely improvisational approach. The only consistency to the movie is that of image and emotion. Throughout the movie is laced with the anguish of haunted souls and punctuated by the slowmo killings after the fashion of Peckinpah. The improvisation can unfortunately be quite clear. Some of the actors were writing their own lines the night before shooting. The dialogue is not always brilliant to say the least and it is not helped by Nero's far from accentless English. However this is about the only film where improvisation could work simply because it is entirely beneficial to the oneiric logicless atmosphere.The De Angelis brothers' soundtrack will be interesting to some because of the untrained voices. Nero sings quite a lot of it himself and you will have to suspend disbelief and accept it because although the man clearly has no singing talent there is an authenticity to his singing that is refreshing.I'm not sure what Woody Strode was doing in this picture but flashbacks of him shooting his bow add to the trippiness. Keoma the movie is not quite as farout as something by Jodorowsky but it's on the way.".

He sets up a community for those infected and this where Keoma rescues a pregnant woman on her way there and returns her back to town. His three halfbrothers have joined Caldwell and I don't think that highly of their brother's return. But loyalty to their father they won't kill him. His father William Shannon and former family servantonly friend George eventually join Keoma to break the strangle hold Caldwell possess.Whoa! How good? Real good. Director Enzo G. Castellari's grand looking and interesting spaghetti western comes across as a powerful and beautifully constructed Greek tragedy with a cynical and almost psychological edge bound to it. There's a bit everything chucked into this passionate and intelligent exercise. Breathing high on mood and atmosphere photographer Aiace Parolin exquisitely frames the mercilessly brooding locations and Castellari's stylishly firstrate direction keeps the film sombre with a brutally unsparing and dirtlaced tone in its dramatic images and context. Good use of abstract lighting and composition he knows how to keep the viewer at bay with slambang set pieces towards the end and a downbeat undercurrent. Inventive framing and exposition also shows the quality of his direction. The glorious slowmotion shootouts and editing technique ala Sam Peckinpah are dazzling and how about the constant jumping or leaping in the air. Was there a hidden trampoline on set?! Everything about it held a nice rhythm to it and you just get swept along. Even the flashback sequences are positioned in the story accordingly and in a fulfilling style. The lyrical story is full of symbolic and thematic issues freedom being the main focal point that do pack a punch but also showing a vulnerable side. This gave it a real singular vibe to set it apart from the crowd. Hell I didn't mind the uncanny and soaring ballad soundtrack too. The way it actually interlocked with the film's sequences I thought it gave the film some soul and a backbone well other than always charismatically reliable Nero. A rugged Franco Nero was outstanding. Both mentally and psychically in his scrappy determination and seldom figure Keoma. The impressively committed Woody Strode was excellent. William Berger brought class and Olga Karlatos decently balanced out an innocent side that really was moving. Donald O'Brien nails it down in a starch turn as the villainous Caldwell.".

	schema:headline " KEOMA Enzo G. Castellari 1976 ";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Castellari is nowadays perhaps bestknown if at all by the younger generation of film buffs for one thing making the original INGLORIOUS BASTARDS 1977 which Quentin Tarantino has been threatening to remake for years now. However in my opinion he should instead be remembered for making this impressive belated Spaghetti Western gem.An odd blend of violent action and heady mysticism apparently concocted by one of the credited screenwriters Luigi Montefiori better known to hardened EuroCult fans as an actor under the alias of George Eastman but as star Franco Nero and Castellari himself state in the Anchor Bay DVD supplements the script took so long to get written that they decided to work without one and make the dialogue up as they went along! That the end result is so satisfying and practically unique in the subgenre is a remarkable achievement in itself.Keoma is a halfbreed returning home from the American Civil War to find his hometown ravaged by the plague and overtaken by the villainous Caldwell Donal O' Brien among his cohorts are Nero's three halfbrothers who had made his childhood a living hell with his surrogate father William Berger and colored mentor turned banjoplaying towndrunk Woody Strode unable to do much to counter Caldwell's oppression. A Bergmanesque cadaverous old woman is frequently seen roaming the streets dragging a cart behind her...What follows is the typical confrontation between Good and Evil but Castellari infuses the familiar mixture with several directorial flourishes occasionally striking compositions particularly a memorably Fordian opening shot frequent use of slowmotion in true Peckinpahstyle flashbacks in which Keoma is a spectator to his own past experiences inspired by Elia Kazan's THE ARRANGEMENT 1969! a touch of elliptical editing Christian symbolism Keoma is crucified at one point and most distressingly of all a folksy soundtrack inspired by Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan no less and warbled...er...sung by a shrill highpitched female singer and an outoftune deepvoiced male which narrates in song the action we're seeing on the screen. I say distressingly because the Guido and Maurizo De Angelis compositions found here have forever been a thorn in the side of even the film's staunchest admirers!! Personally I didn't mind the female singer so much after a while but when her possibly drunk male companion took over in the last half hour I was in for some cringeinducing moments for sure...! Despite these misgivings the film is still one of the best Spaghetti Westerns out there and certainly the last great example of the subgenre its undoubted highlight is provided by a terrific lovingly protracted action setpiece in which Nero Berger and a reformed Strode back to his former arrowshooting glory  perhaps a nod to the role he played in Richard Brooks' splendid THE PROFESSIONALS 1966 wipe out most of Caldwell's gang. Their triumph is shortlived however because both Berger and Strode lose their lives in the ongoing struggle Berger poignantly so while Strode's death scene is particularly great with Nero almost bowing out himself under the strain of his siblings' torture  who have subsequently disposed of Caldwell and taken over the town themselves the final confrontation then between Keoma and his three halfbrothers is eerily set to the strains of Olga Karlatos' playing a woman Keoma had earlier on saved from a plagueinfested colony wailing and screaming as she lies giving birth to a child amidst the carnage! While at first I was disappointed that the Anchor Bay DVD only included the English dub having watched it now it seems clear that the actors were all speaking their dialogue in English on the set  although as connoisseurs will certainly know this was all rerecorded back in the studios anyway as was common practice in the Italian film industry. Still if ever it gets shown again on Italian TV I'll be sure to check it out just for completeness' sake. Thankfully however Castellari contributes a highly enthusiastic and informative Audio Commentary in which he discusses his major influences while making the film among them Sidney J. Furie's THE APPALOOSA 1966 Altman's McCABE AND MRS. MILLER 1971 and Peckinpah's PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID 1973.Ultimately Franco Nero in the title role is almost as iconic a figure as Django and hopefully I should be getting to another fairly obscure but highly intriguing Spaghetti Westen of his  Luigi Bazzoni's MAN PRIDE AND VENGEANCE 1968 an eccentric updating of Georges Bizet's opera Carmen costarring Klaus Kinski and Tina Aumont  pretty soon...".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Castellari is nowadays perhaps bestknown if at all by the younger generation of film buffs for one thing making the original INGLORIOUS BASTARDS 1977 which Quentin Tarantino has been threatening to remake for years now. However in my opinion he should instead be remembered for making this impressive belated Spaghetti Western gem.An odd blend of violent action and heady mysticism apparently concocted by one of the credited screenwriters Luigi Montefiori better known to hardened EuroCult fans as an actor under the alias of George Eastman but as star Franco Nero and Castellari himself state in the Anchor Bay DVD supplements the script took so long to get written that they decided to work without one and make the dialogue up as they went along! That the end result is so satisfying and practically unique in the subgenre is a remarkable achievement in itself.Keoma is a halfbreed returning home from the American Civil War to find his hometown ravaged by the plague and overtaken by the villainous Caldwell Donal O' Brien among his cohorts are Nero's three halfbrothers who had made his childhood a living hell with his surrogate father William Berger and colored mentor turned banjoplaying towndrunk Woody Strode unable to do much to counter Caldwell's oppression. A Bergmanesque cadaverous old woman is frequently seen roaming the streets dragging a cart behind her...What follows is the typical confrontation between Good and Evil but Castellari infuses the familiar mixture with several directorial flourishes occasionally striking compositions particularly a memorably Fordian opening shot frequent use of slowmotion in true Peckinpahstyle flashbacks in which Keoma is a spectator to his own past experiences inspired by Elia Kazan's THE ARRANGEMENT 1969! a touch of elliptical editing Christian symbolism Keoma is crucified at one point and most distressingly of all a folksy soundtrack inspired by Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan no less and warbled...er...sung by a shrill highpitched female singer and an outoftune deepvoiced male which narrates in song the action we're seeing on the screen. I say distressingly because the Guido and Maurizo De Angelis compositions found here have forever been a thorn in the side of even the film's staunchest admirers!! Personally I didn't mind the female singer so much after a while but when her possibly drunk male companion took over in the last half hour I was in for some cringeinducing moments for sure...! Despite these misgivings the film is still one of the best Spaghetti Westerns out there and certainly the last great example of the subgenre its undoubted highlight is provided by a terrific lovingly protracted action setpiece in which Nero Berger and a reformed Strode back to his former arrowshooting glory  perhaps a nod to the role he played in Richard Brooks' splendid THE PROFESSIONALS 1966 wipe out most of Caldwell's gang. Their triumph is shortlived however because both Berger and Strode lose their lives in the ongoing struggle Berger poignantly so while Strode's death scene is particularly great with Nero almost bowing out himself under the strain of his siblings' torture  who have subsequently disposed of Caldwell and taken over the town themselves the final confrontation then between Keoma and his three halfbrothers is eerily set to the strains of Olga Karlatos' playing a woman Keoma had earlier on saved from a plagueinfested colony wailing and screaming as she lies giving birth to a child amidst the carnage! While at first I was disappointed that the Anchor Bay DVD only included the English dub having watched it now it seems clear that the actors were all speaking their dialogue in English on the set  although as connoisseurs will certainly know this was all rerecorded back in the studios anyway as was common practice in the Italian film industry. Still if ever it gets shown again on Italian TV I'll be sure to check it out just for completeness' sake. Thankfully however Castellari contributes a highly enthusiastic and informative Audio Commentary in which he discusses his major influences while making the film among them Sidney J. Furie's THE APPALOOSA 1966 Altman's McCABE AND MRS. MILLER 1971 and Peckinpah's PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID 1973.Ultimately Franco Nero in the title role is almost as iconic a figure as Django and hopefully I should be getting to another fairly obscure but highly intriguing Spaghetti Westen of his  Luigi Bazzoni's MAN PRIDE AND VENGEANCE 1968 an eccentric updating of Georges Bizet's opera Carmen costarring Klaus Kinski and Tina Aumont  pretty soon...";

	schema:reviewBody "After the American Civil War the halfbreed Keoma Franco Nero returns to his homeland and rescues a beautiful pregnant woman accused of having plague Lisa Olga Karlatos from a gang leaded by the landlord Caldwell Donald O'Brian. Later he meets his former slave servant and friend George Woody Strode now a drunk free man and his father William Shannon William Berger and he is informed that the town is under siege of Caldwell's men without supplies of medicine or food and justice with the dweller dying of plague and starvation and sick people is being isolated in an old mine. Further his three dangerous halfbrothers have joined Caldwell's force. Keoma decides to help Lisa and the dwellers to retrieve their freedom and dignity and he finds how despicable the inhabitants are.The unknown western Keoma was a great surprise for me. Although predictable the story is great disclosing the relationship of Keoma with his brothers and father through his recollections from his childhood and does not have a happy commercial end. Franco Nero is amazing in the role of a lonely halfIndian with a great sense of justice and freedom love and loyalty to his father and regret and resentment to his halfbrothers. The direction and cinematography are excellent with a fantastic choreography of the fights set decoration and costumes in the dusty windy and dirty city the men's clothes and themselves are very dirty and not like in most of Hollywood movies where the cowboys wear very clean clothes. There is a particular scene that I believe is unique in the cinema when Keoma promises four bullets for four hit men and while bending his four fingers we see each of his targets. The annoying soundtrack although having the good intention of creating a narrative of the feelings of the characters is the only negative aspect in this movie. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Keoma".

	schema:headline " Amazing experiments with sound and pictures  Contains Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing people notice when watching this movie are Castellari's obvious references to Peckinpah lots of violence in slow motion. The second thing they won't forget is the soundtrack with the male and the female voice. The two singers are narrating the story. Both ideas are stretched a little too much. I find the many unusual camera angles and various other creative experiments more interesting. To name but a few a the shooting competition between Keoma and his father is filmed from the target's point of view b the amazing shot when Keoma counts his enemies by his fingers  and they appear behind the fingers c the crucifixion of Keoma when the pregnant woman comes to rescue him d the appearances of the mystical old woman seem like a quote from Macbeth' a witch on a stormy heath her prophecies of death e the many brightly colored flashbacks mainly from Keoma's childhood are so fluently and frequently integrated you hardly ever see this in a movie. Most amazing however is f the final shootout when Keoma kills his 3 adversaries while you hear nothing but the mother's screams while her baby is born. The pictures of lives ended the sound of new life born so to speak. Very often in Keoma' the sound is a comment on what's happening or will happen rather than just the usual noises of the action taking place.Apart from the fascinating experiments with both picture and sound the movie would be worth watching for the unconventional story alone. Keoma fights bandits who  in the name of common sense  built a concentration camp for victims of a disease. Remember a doc in any other western who did anything else than cutting a bullet out of somebody's arm? The fear of pestilence helps the bandits to take control over the town. No happyend of course Keoma's father and the woman he loves are dead and Keoma leaves her baby behind just like that he is free he doesn't need anything'. Franco Nero gives the wildest and most manic performance in his entire career. And he has so many great oneliners it's easy to kill someone who's already dead'.The only reason I can imagine why this movie is not ranked equal to the Italian western classics by Leone Corbucci and Sollima is probably that it was released 610 years later when nobody cared about westerns anymore. I hope you do especially in this case.".

However they will also most probably comment on the atrocious soundtrack which does take some getting used to. I honestly believe that if this movie had been given the Morricone touch it would be firmly cemented as a true Spaghetti classic standing side by side with The Big Gundown Face to Face and Bullet for the General.Aside from Django this is Franco Nero's best role. A half breed venger riding into a town decimated by both the plague and a gang of racist exConfederates which includes his three hateful brothers in their ranks. There are also fine turns by William Berger as Keoma's adopted father Shannon and Woody Strode as Keoma's childhood hero turned drunk George.As always Castellari has injected true class into this film with slow motion shootouts effective flashbacks and clever camera tricks. This film is a true fitting end to the Spaghetti hay day which had begun to loose its charm due to the ever increasing stupidity of the comedy westerns. The only negative aspect is that wretched soundtrack. Oh where was Morricone when we really needed him?".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the great spaghetti westerns. Franco Nero puts in what is perhaps his best performance ever and it's great to see that his voice is not dubbed by someone else here. This is an action packed gut wrenching on the edge of your seat western from start to finish. It also has all the style symbolism and violence one could ask for from a spaghetti western and then some.This film has been criticized for a few different reasons and I feel compelled to address a couple of those comments. The number one topic for discussion seems to be the soundtrack. Yes the soundtrack is a bit strange but so is the movie so in a way it's fitting. Personally I think it's kind of hit and miss but it works for the most part. I really like the female vocals. Her voice has a creepy melancholy and otherworldly quality to it that matches the film perfectly. The male vocals on the other hand sounded like an Italian muppet to me at first. Perhaps the cookie monster. I do have to say though that I just watched the film for the third time and the guy doesn't sound nearly as bad to me as he did the first time. This is a damn good movie anyway regardless of whether or not one likes the soundtrack.Another criticism I've heard is that Franco Nero plays an Indian with an Italian accent. First of all this kind of thing is very common in films. Think of all the Romans Greeks Martians etc. that have had English or American accents in the movies. This is no different except that in this movie it actually adds to the characterization of Keoma. He is an outsider and the fact that his accent is so unique to the setting just adds to the effect.Keoma's flashbacks to his boyhood are extremely well done and the children they picked to play him and his halfbrothers are very realistically matched to their adult counterparts. There are some cool slowmotion action scenes and the action scenes in general are topnotch. I also like the character of the old woman who seems to have some kind of supernatural link to Keoma. We're never quite sure what her relationship is to him or even whether she is real or not. The acting from all of the main players is also very well done and the cinematography is beautiful.This is one of those spaghetti westerns that stands out from the crowd. It's a mustsee if you are at all interested in the genre. I would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns action flicks or movies that are not made with a cookiecutter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Castellari's Keoma was part of the late 1970's second wave of spaghetti westerns. It is typically considered one of the better entries in the genre some even rate it as a classic alongside Leone's masterpieces. However while it has clearly been attempted to make the film look stylish and sophisticated and at a casual glance it does look pretty well made a more in depth look shows that it falls quite a long way off the mark.Basically it's clear that what Castellari has is a bunch of director's tricks up his sleeve  slow motion unconventional camera angles subtle merges into flashbacks and so on  all of them thieved from the work of other filmmakers. That in itself is no bad thing  after all Tarantino has made a career out of doing the same  but the difference is that Castellari clearly has no idea how and when to use these techniques. He simply throws them in at every opportunity so that they actually stick out rather than enhance the film. The most obvious example is the Sam Peckinpah style slow motion deaths after someone is shot. In Peckinpah's films it was used skilfully to highlight the brutality of certain killings here and there throughout the movie. In Keoma it is used more or less every time someone is shot  about forty or fifty altogether  totally losing any impact it might have had.Add to this that Keoma is a completely boring spaghetti western character  basically just a hippy with a colt  and not one of Franco Nero's better performances. The dialogue is terrible. The plot is text book spaghetti western backforrevenge. This movie doesn't really have a lot going for it.And then there is the music famous itself among spaghetti western fans for being almost unlistenably bad which seems to sum up the feeling of the entire film. Quite a nice melody but either sung in a piercing shriek by the female vocalist or an unnerving growl by the male vocalist.In short Keoma is a perfect example of style over substance  it's all dazzling flair in an attempt to cover up a pretty poor film. Viewers should stick to the real classic spaghettis like Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci's work.".

Franco Nero was pretty good but his dialogue felt forced and was generally awful. The part where he called his former friend and mentor a nigger and then said Oh I'm sorry was ridiculous and totally out of place with the scene and his character.The score started out very nice but was absolutely ruined by the inane singing from what sounded like a drunk Phyllis Diller and a sober Boris Yeltsin. I actually think it was Franco doing the singing for the man and the old witchlikesoothsayer singing the woman's part.In one of first fight sequences some bad guy gets a knife thrown at his hand knocking out his gun. Cut to Keoma who is approximately 12 a mile away looking mean having been the one who threw the knife. Must have been attached to a rocket.The fistfight scenes were pretty good and when Keoma does the four finger thing  that was probably the coolest part of the film. They had some pretty good ideas for this film with the relationship between Keoma and his father and his half brothers but Castellari just couldn't put these ideas into a film that engages the audience. You cannot begin to compare this film with the likes of Leone or Corbucci in their prime.I rate this film one notch below Petroni's Death Rides a Horse. I didn't much care for that one either but it was slightly more entertaining than Keoma.".

	schema:headline " Some good gun play but it could have been better";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to pretty much agree with the two negative reviews below and I'll explain why in a minute.Franco Nero plays Keoma a halfbreed Indian raised by a white man named Shannon William Berger who also has three sons adoptive brothers of Keoma who hate him and have never accepted a 'halfbreed' as their brother.There's also George Woody Strode an exslave and friend of Shannon's who teaches Keoma all he knows about fighting.Cut 20 years later after some flashbacks and Keoma returns to the town near where he was raised and finds that a plague has engulfed the town with a quarantine imposed by a wealthy mine owner Caldwell Donald O'Brien who would just as soon have it's inhabitants all die off so he can fully control the area. Keoma steps in to save a pregnant woman who Caldwell's men suspect as a plague carrier and all hell breaks loose. Yeah some of the knife throwing does look ludicrous but the fist fights look good and there's an excellent gun battle in town between Keoma Shannon and George vs. Caldwell's men. It's really done well and it looks like it was filmed in the same western set built outside of Rome as DJANGO was ten years earlier. By this time though the place looks pretty run down and cluttered which makes a good setting for a plagueinfested town.As far as negatives go the music sucks. It's an annoying high pitch mostly female whine that appears periodically throughout the move inter sprinkled with 'singing' done by Franco Nero himself. It sounds awful as he tries to imitate Leonard Cohen but winds up sounding like a lame Tom Waits. I don't know why anybody likes it. To each his own I guess. There's also the annoying Sam Peckinpahlike slowmotion effects that become a clich used over and over. It ruins some of the great gunfights especially at the end where Keoma is battling his brothers in a barn while the pregnant lady's screams drown out all the gun battle sound. A little too arty for my tastes. The dubbing is OK and it sounds like Nero dubbed in his own voice which comes off as strange and foreign for a halfbreed American Indian. I suppose one gets used to it as the film goes along. The Anchor Bay DVD uses an anamorphic widescreen print that looks pretty good. Only a few scratches during the opening and closing titles. No closed captioning. Nero also does a 10 minute interview explaining how the film came about along with a secondary audio track by director Enzo Castellari giving details about the filming. Yeah the spaghetti western genre was dead by the time this film was made but Castellari says it did very well in Italy although not enough to revive the genre. Tastes were moving towards gangsters and crime dramas by the mid70s so this film was an exception not the rule.It has some good ideas but I wouldn't consider it a masterpiece for the genre or anything. However I did enjoy some of the gun play and fistfights.6 out of 10".

There is minimal character development. The musical score is a wailing mess. Already in it's death throws Keoma definitely nails the spaghtetti western coffin shut.

So bottom line it was a disappointment to watch one that I basically just didn't like.I think we all agree the soundtrack is awful. But the awful songs can be muted while they're wailing away I don't know one can really call it singing. But the big problem for me was that it was obvious that the director had been told it was the last SW the studio was doing and he's WAY too conscious of that fact. Also we watch SWs for what they are not for how they inspired other genres creating some kind of weird cinematic echo chamber. Elements of Peckinpaugh and Hong Kong action flicks but not integrated in any way. Just kind of Let's do some of that...If you notice the firearms and the year it'll drive you nuts. Obviously supposed to be circa 1870 mostly it's what you'd expect to see immediately after the Civil War. But it's like they ran out of period arms and just grabbed whatever else was around for some scenes. Lots of 1873 Winchester rifles and I thought even saw the odd 1890's model. Ditto the Colt Peacemaker alongside your standard issue Civil War Colt. I suppose it could be 1874 but were those arms instantly available everywhere??? Given the rest one thinks they weren't too concerned about it.Bottom line for me it was a seriously misguided attempt that is waaaay too conscious of its being what it is the swan song of the classic pasta western.".

	schema:reviewBody "Notable actors Franco Nero! William Berger! Olga Karlatos! Orso Maria Guerri! Antonio Marsina! Joshua Sinclair! Woody Strode! Donald O'Brien! Massimo Vanni!Guido and Maurizio De Angelis Soundtrack!This is one of my favourite Westerns A windy filth covered Shakespearean dystopic nightmare where just about every character lives in a physical and mental hell that seems to end in some sort of bizarre Nativity play!In an empty town where the only sound is the wind and a door banging the most raggedyass gunslinger you've laid eyes on arrives and is only noticed by an old woman scrabbling about in a pile of rubbish. The gunslinger is Keoma just returned from fighting in the civil war. The old woman may or may not exist at all as the only person who interacts with her is Keoma himself. Keoma does pause long enough to have a flashback to being rescued from a massacre and you'll notice in this film people have flashbacks to a more colourful time while they also remain in shot looking at their younger selves. Keoma finds that all is not well in the place he grew up. A mysterious plague has taken over the town but the town's new leader a jerk called Caldwell will not help the townsfolk and instead has his men forced sick people to work in a mine. Keoma also finds that even though his father is still around he's too old now to take on Caldwell himself plus Keoma's half brothers have sided with Caldwell because he's the strongest. Keoma's old friend George Woody Strode who tutored Keoma as a kid and plays a nifty banjo has now turned into a hopeless drunk who is racially abused by Caldwell's men. What really sets Keoma off however is the treatment of a pregnant woman a nice vulnerable turn from Olga Karlatos.

This is all basically leading up to a showdown between Keoma and Caldwell his many minions and the three brothers.There's a lot of trippy stuff going on in this film and a lot of mumbly philosophy from Keoma George and Keoma's Dad the great William Berger but the film is directed by Enzo Castellari a man who never forgets the action.

What puts people off however is the soundtrack which features a lady doing a falsetto while a man does what sounds almost like Siberian throat singing. I don't mind it though  it adds to the otherworldly feel of the film and if you can make out the lyrics you'll find out why Keoma protects Olga so much she remind him of his mum!.There's good performances from William Berger the man can excude genuine charm Nero who appears to be covered in filth from head to toe but does his most expressive 'wet eye' acting and Olga Karlatos who is resigned to death and can't believe someone's helping her. Donald O'Brien Joshua Sinclair and such like don't get too much room to move however as the bad guys.Words can't do this one justice really. And remember No man born free shall ever die!".

	onyx:emotionText "Notable actors Franco Nero! William Berger! Olga Karlatos! Orso Maria Guerri! Antonio Marsina! Joshua Sinclair! Woody Strode! Donald O'Brien! Massimo Vanni!Guido and Maurizio De Angelis Soundtrack!This is one of my favourite Westerns A windy filth covered Shakespearean dystopic nightmare where just about every character lives in a physical and mental hell that seems to end in some sort of bizarre Nativity play!In an empty town where the only sound is the wind and a door banging the most raggedyass gunslinger you've laid eyes on arrives and is only noticed by an old woman scrabbling about in a pile of rubbish. The gunslinger is Keoma just returned from fighting in the civil war. The old woman may or may not exist at all as the only person who interacts with her is Keoma himself. Keoma does pause long enough to have a flashback to being rescued from a massacre and you'll notice in this film people have flashbacks to a more colourful time while they also remain in shot looking at their younger selves. Keoma finds that all is not well in the place he grew up. A mysterious plague has taken over the town but the town's new leader a jerk called Caldwell will not help the townsfolk and instead has his men forced sick people to work in a mine. Keoma also finds that even though his father is still around he's too old now to take on Caldwell himself plus Keoma's half brothers have sided with Caldwell because he's the strongest. Keoma's old friend George Woody Strode who tutored Keoma as a kid and plays a nifty banjo has now turned into a hopeless drunk who is racially abused by Caldwell's men. What really sets Keoma off however is the treatment of a pregnant woman a nice vulnerable turn from Olga Karlatos. He finds her being carted off to the mines and we find out very shortly into the film that Keoma is the quickest draw in the land as he unloads his shotgun directly into Massimo Vanni's chest. This is all basically leading up to a showdown between Keoma and Caldwell his many minions and the three brothers.There's a lot of trippy stuff going on in this film and a lot of mumbly philosophy from Keoma George and Keoma's Dad the great William Berger but the film is directed by Enzo Castellari a man who never forgets the action.

This decision doesn't bode well with the soldiersaccompanied by his rival halfbrothersand Keoma is often at odds with them trying to keep the woman out of the camp so that she can have her child in a more comfortable less dangerous environment. With help from freed slave George his mentor and father William Shannon Keoma will have to shoot it out with Caldwell's innumerable army who have been keeping supplies and medicine from the town and sick of the plague. Meanwhile The Shannon trio plan to let Keoma and Caldwell kill each other in the hopes of taking over the town when those two are out of the way.Brilliantly utilizing Peckinpah slow motion to superb dramatic effect along with some breathtaking tracking shots throughout not to mention terrific lengthly gunfight between Keoma his father and George against Caldwell's endless army in the town Enzo G Castellari crafts one hell of a western further building the iconic status of Franco Nero as a formidable gunslinger hero. Enzo simply understands how to build a scene to it's crescendo and his camera is able to capture so much in terms of both exciting action and expressionistic faces of the many different characters who enter the picture. Heavy emphasis on musical influence to envelope the viewer and Enzo's use of dusty windand rain at the end as Keoma is bound to a wheel overlooking the townis phenomenal. Definitely an underrated western and deserves to be more well known than it is. Woody Strode is such a welcome presence as Keoma's idol fallen into alcoholism having sold his beloved bow to purchase liquor now a laughingstock treated with ridicule. Olga Karlatos even as a pregnant woman falling on hard times is astonishingly beautiful as shot by Castellari her face like so many in the film revealing so much without saying a word. I believe the greatest compliment to give to this movie is how Castellari arranges poetic scenes of characters communicating to each other through silence eyes meeting yet speaking much louder than wordslike the heartbreaking capture of William Shannon by Caldwell as Keoma knows he's defeated only to witness a horrifying tragedy despite his surrender. William Berger as Will Shannon shares wonderful scenes with Nero during their father and son chats and their joining forces signifies their characters' love for one another. Gabriella Giacobbe has a fascinating part as the witch someone who reappears at various points in the film when Keoma is confronted with difficult tasks. Donald O'Brien is scoundrel Caldwell a real dirtbag who uses his men to wield his power with Orso Maria Guerrini Antonio Marsina and Joshua Sinclair as the Brothers Shannon. Castellari closes the film with the Brothers Shannon out to finally rid themselves of their lifelong nuisance the gunfight juxtaposed with Karlatos' childbirth..it's kind of anticlimatic after all that preceded it but we knew it would come down to this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Keoma The Avenger 1976 is a Spaghetti Western directed by Enzo G. Castellari who would late make the 1976 film Inglorious Bastards a film that Quentin Tarantino paid a large homage to in Inglorious Basterds 2008 and stars genre stalwart Franco Nero. This film comes from the dying days of the genre when it was in its protracted and some times painful decline. Only one or two more Spaghetti Westerns were made before it died but this particular entry is among the best and can stand comparison with anything made in the 1960s. It is a great last hurrah all the better for being resolutely unnostalgic.The script is by Mino Roli Nico Ducci Luigi Montefiori and Enzo Girolami it covers familiar territory but in an unusual fashion Halfbreed Indian Keoma Nero returns after the American Civil War to his border hometown where he finds it under the control of an exConfederate raider called Caldwell Donald O'Brien and his gang. Keoma's three halfbrothers have also united with Caldwell and want to make sure Keoma doesn't hang around.What distinguishes this banal storyline is the overt use of not just allegorical mysticism but also borrowings from ancient Greek plays such as the wandering Earthmother character which is splendidly played by Gabriella Giacobbe. This surprising if obvious use of symbolism coupled with apocalyptic imagery really makes the film standout in your memory.The direction from Castellari is highly efficient and one of the best parts of the film. However the frequent use of slow motion while well done is derivative of Sam Peckinpah but without his mature understanding of violence. Here it is just done for cool effect.The cast is exceptional in its bringing together icons of the genre from Franco Nero Django himself to such great supporting actors as William Berger Woody Strode and Donald O'Brien. All give performances perfectly suited to their roles and are almost reason enough to watch the film.On the debt side unfortunately is a fairly terrible score by Guido  Maurizio De Angelis with some terrible singing sounding like drunken amateur folk singers punctuating the action like nails on a blackboard ah well you can't have it all can you? Still this is a hugely enjoyable late entry in the spaghetti Western oeuvre that I highly recommend.".

In the future I plan to rewatch Keoma with the sound muted. That's the only way I feel I could sit through it again! Who knows? Maybe I'll enjoy it! I really wanted to like this movie. I wouldn't normally recommend a movie that I gave a 4 of 10 rating for but If you can rent this one you need to hear the score just for laughs.".

Tulsi Chakraborty who plays a role of a lifetime in this classic piece is the clerk whose life changes after he discovers that the small simple stone is the Parash Pathar the stone which can give him infinite riches as long as he can find enough scrap iron. The comical flair of Tulsi Chakraborty is a treat to watch. It would not be an exaggeration to say that he is possibly one of the finest actors to come out of India who can play a comic role with lan and ease.The wit of the script is enjoyable throughout though this can get lost in subtitles. This is a movie which is fun to watch specially in scenes where we see Tulsi Chakraborty learning the ways of a rich man attending parties planning how to spend his new found wealth. Overall I rate this film at 910. Highly recommended.".

In contrast to those films Porosh Pathor was more of a magicalrealist dark comedy rather than a drama. It didn't have a laughoutloud kind of humour either but had a more subtle kind of humour. However the concept behind the film was creative and innovative while the plot was more meaningful and thoughtprovoking than most comedies.The philosopher's stone has long been a dream of alchemists since at least the Middle Ages but the film attempts to portray the consequences this may have on society when someone finally obtains the legendary stone. Although the film was rushed as Ray himself admitted his direction for the film is still impressive. It was also nice for a change that the film wasn't tragic like the other Ray films I saw but was more upbeat overall. Although it wasn't powerful like Ray's other films Porosh Pathor was an enjoyable yet thoughtprovoking film to watch.710".

Only one that I didn't love is Parash Pathar.Satyajit Ray is my favorite filmmaker and all of his movies are master pieces. It is hard to find a fault in any of his movies. Acting is always very good yet subtle. Background score is never over the top. There is no cheap melodrama and the viewer is encouraged to make his own conclusions. Even a minor actor not acting up to par has a jarring effect. It is like watching a blemish on an extraordinary piece of art.So I was quite surprised by this movie as the lead character Paresh Chandra Dutt was overacting a lot. So were some other actors. While in almost all Ray's movies characters are very real here they are caricatures instead and there is no subtlety to be found. Also the story never took an unexpected turn it is another morality tale centered around philosopher's's stone. Though you can find Ray's touches here and there there are not enough of them to save the film.Though it a good film when compared with other Indian films of the same period it doesn't in any way compares with Ray's other movies. I would recommend it only to Ray's die hard fans like me. Though I didn't really liked the movie I didn't consider it a waste of time either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three of alltime's greatest Horror icons in one movie  which true horror fan would not love a film like that? Vernon Sewell's Curse Of The Crimson Altar of 1968 may not be a particularly memorable example for British Gothic Horror from the late sixties. More precisely it is often extremely cheesy and far from being a masterpiece but the brilliant casting of Boris Karloff Christopher Lee and the wonderful Barbara Steele makes this a mustsee for every lover of Gothic Horror.The story is apparently loosely based on H.P. Lovecraft's Dreams in the Witch House. The film bears little resemblance to the short story by Lovecraft however. It does however resemble several other Horror films from the 1960s in many aspects especially the brilliant City Of The Dead of 1960s which also starred Christopher Lee even though it comes nowhere near its brilliance of course.After his brother has gone missing Antiques dealer Robert Manning Mark Eden travels to the village of Greymarsh where his brother was last seen in a huge mansion. Manning is kindly welcomed by the mansion's owner Mr. Morley Christopher Lee a descendant of Lavinia Morley Barbara Steele a 17th century witch who before being burned at the stake put a curse on the people of Greymarsh. Manning who has no clue of where his brother is yet gets along very well with his guestkeeper's beautiful niece Eve Virginia Wetherell. Somehow however the area still seems to be under the menacing spell of Lavina...The film is of course particularly worth watching for its three stars. Christopher Lee is as always great and the incomparable Boris Karloff shines in one of his last roles as an eccentric old witchcraft expert who collects 'instruments of torture'. The greatest treat is the wonderful Barbara Steele one of my favorite actresses and the greatest female Horroricon ever in the role of the greenfaced witch Lavina wearing a bizarre horned crown. The supporting cast includes two other memorable British actors Michael Gough Horror Of Dracula who plays a butler and Rupert Davies Witchfinder General. Beautiful Viriginia Wetherell fits well in her role as Eve and also grants a peak at her lovely backside. The film is practically bloodless but it is partly quite atmospheric and occasionally quite weird as several scenes seem quite bizarre and feature weird SM style costumes. All things considered the film is great fun to watch. It is certainly not highly memorable in any aspect except for the cast but what a cast that is! No true lover of Horror can afford to miss a film starring Boris Karloff Christopher Lee and Barbara Steele. Steele alone makes this a must for Horror fans in her green makeup! Recommended.".

So just what is it? Well first and foremost there's the wonderful pairing of Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee both of whom give performances way above the level of the product they were working with and there's the lovely Barbara Steele portraying the green skinned witch Lavinia. On top of that there's the very 'Britishness' of it all it's like a mad little time capsule the sophisticates chasing a cat suit wearing girl through the forest explaining to the hero that 'it's a rather sophisticated kind of hide and seek' what? and the anything goes swinging sixties party blend wonderfully with the slightly psychedelic hallucinations experienced by Robert Manning. Then there are little moments like the gas station attendant Ron Pember actually filling the car 'Craxted Lodge' he says 'oh yeah I know Craxted Lodge' in a slightly sinister and loaded way when was the last time that happened? And the cost the total for petrol is 1 pound 7 shillings and six pence about 90 pence in new money! On top of that there is a nice feeling of the 'village where something is not quite right' and the useful device of having the world's foremost expert on witchcraft Professor John Marshe Boris Karloff as a resident and his friendship with a descendant Squire Morley Christopher Lee of the notorious witch Lavinia Barbara Steele whose burning at the stake is commemorated in an annual festival which just so happens to be occurring just as the hero Robert Manning Mark Eden arrives on the scene in search of his missing brother Peter Denys Peek. In a knowing nod to the genre Manning commenting about the house says at one point that you expect Boris Karloff to pop up any minute and of course he does. Add to this the slightly sinister man servant Elder Michael Gough the romantic interest Eve Morley Virginia Wetherell and a wonderful old house and what you get is a really nice little movie but one whose parts are unusually better than the whole. Incidentally I stayed at the house back in the 80s and it really is a lovely place loaded with atmosphere and I was genuinely thrilled knowing the movie was made there. Of course there are downfalls. Tigon have been accused of taking a rather crude and exploitative approach to horror although at least two of their films 'Witchfinder General' 1968 and 'Blood on Satan's Claw' 1970 are in their own ways outstanding but the script here is rather weak and fails to flow from time to time which is not helped by the somewhat pedestrian direction. It would be pointless however to attempt a dissection of this movie's technical merits if you want to do that take a look at the same year's 'Rosemary's Baby'. If on the other hand you just want a great if somewhat silly old British witchcraft movie then look no further than this.".

It was filmed in 1968 and reminded me somewhat of The Dunwich Horror which was made around the same time and similarly attempted to update Lovecraft with setpieces inspired by the drug culture and the Summer of Love.  The difference with the Crimson Cult is that it was filmed in England with a stellar cast who can actually act unlike poor fishoutofwater Miss Sandra Dee in Dunwich. It is a treat to see Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee trading pleasantries in their scenes.  Michael Gough extracts the maximum from his small role as a pitifully unhinged factotum.  Barbara Steele exudes a grandly Gothic malevolence in her scenes as Lavinia.  She is probably the single most memorable presence in the film and whatever power it possesses is largely thanks to her. Great costume too!  The dungeon sequences are probably the best though my favorite moment in the film occurs when the innocent young man asks Karloff's sinister professor What do you collect? and with a friendly grin Karloff replies Instruments of torture!  Marvelous moment.This movie is ridiculously difficult to find.  After years of searching I located a bootlegged videotape which is in terrible conditiongrainy and the colors which should be vividly overthetop are quite washed out. Also the print lacks the original score which was quite nifty as I recall from seeing it on American television in the early 70s.  There is supposed to be a laser disc version from the early 90s.  It would be great if a patron who owns this would do a review of that.".

The difference with the Crimson Cult is that it was filmed in England with a stellar cast who can actually act unlike poor fishoutofwater Miss Sandra Dee in Dunwich. It is a treat to see Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee trading pleasantries in their scenes.  Michael Gough extracts the maximum from his small role as a pitifully unhinged factotum.  Barbara Steele exudes a grandly Gothic malevolence in her scenes as Lavinia.  She is probably the single most memorable presence in the film and whatever power it possesses is largely thanks to her. Great costume too!  The dungeon sequences are probably the best though my favorite moment in the film occurs when the innocent young man asks Karloff's sinister professor What do you collect? and with a friendly grin Karloff replies Instruments of torture!  Marvelous moment.This movie is ridiculously difficult to find.  After years of searching I located a bootlegged videotape which is in terrible conditiongrainy and the colors which should be vividly overthetop are quite washed out. Also the print lacks the original score which was quite nifty as I recall from seeing it on American television in the early 70s.  There is supposed to be a laser disc version from the early 90s.  It would be great if a patron who owns this would do a review of that.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was one of the very last accomplishments of the legendary Boris Karloff not quite sure if those Mexican junk movies were shot before this one but they definitely remained shelved until after his death and reportedly he got really ill shortly after  or even during  the shooting of Curse of the Crimson Altar. If this is a true fact it definitely gives the film some sort of sour aftertaste. With a career like his Boris Karloff should have enjoyed a welldeserved retirement instead of catching pneumonia on draughty film sets at the age of 82. On the other hand of course Curse of the Crimson Altar wouldn't have been half as good if it weren't for him. It already isn't much of a highlight in the genre but Karloff's presence along with three others horror veterans provides an extra dimension of horror greatness.This is one of the Tigon Production Company's more mediocre efforts  completely incomparable to The Witchfinder General and Blood on Satan's Claw  but still a remotely entertaining Brithorror flick containing all the traditional ingredients such as witchery torture devices old mansions with secret passageways ritual sacrifices and psychedelic hallucination sequences. The plot revolves on an antique dealer and ladies' man! who heads out to the countryside in search for his mysteriously vanished brother. He arrives in a remote little town during the annual memorial of the legendary witch Lavinia Morley's burning. Mr. Manning is exaggeratedly welcomed at first but he gradually senses something strange and sinister has happened to his brother in the mansion he's staying. When he then begins to suffer from vivid nightmares involving Lavinia herself he realizes his name is historically linked to the witch and that he's been put under a sardonic curse.Apart from the cast Curse of the Crimson Altar benefices the most from its occasionally very moody atmosphere the eerie scenery and the impressively staged witchery sequences. Even though these scenes might appear a little silly overall what with the bodybuilders wearing leather SM outfits but they're still definitely a joy to watch when you're a fan of oldfashioned Gothic horror. Barbara Steele is underused and extremely typecast as the malignant Lavinia but what the heck even with her face painted green and ridiculously oversized goat horns on her head she still remains a luscious beauty. Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee in their second teaming after Corridors of Blood are wonderful together but the still heavily underrated Michael Gough shines as the weird and mentally unstable Elder. Unfortunately however the shoddy script contains too many holes and improbabilities and director Vernon Sewell lacks the talent and horror knowledge to cover these up.One last and perhaps interesting little trivia detail although entirely devoid of humor otherwise Curse of the Crimson Altar features one intentionally wit and unsubtle inside joke. Whilst talking about the old and secluded mansion the main character mentions something in the lines of I expect Boris Karloff to walk in at any moment and  in fact  he does only a couple of minutes later. He rolls in to be exact since he plays a wheelchair bound character.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really wish I had not been loaded on cold medicine and halfway to comatose when I sat down to watch this movie because from what I remember through the Robitussin haze it was pretty cool. A young man named Peter goes missing and his brother Robert tracks him to a grandiose country estate which is lorded over by the elegant Christopher Lee and his blonde bombshell niece Eve. The village is gearing up for a yearly celebration not unlike The Burning Man and Robert has no place to stay while continuing the search for his brother. Mr Lee kindly offers him a room in his mansion although Robert really seems less interested in finding his brother than in getting Eve into bed. However when Robert begins having dreadful nightmares that may not exist only in his head it is up to him Eve and a wheelchair bound Boris Karloff to solve the mystery.There's some really cool stuff in this hardtofind film not the least of which is Barbara Steele with bluegreen skin and a headdress of rams horns surrounded by guys in leather whips and goats masks. As Lavinia Morley the centuries dead witch who may or may not be possessing one of her descendants Steele has rarely looked more beautiful and seductive as she does here. This film never takes itself too seriously and there are some wickedly funny moments something which is all too often missing from horror films or just isn't done right. Boris Karloff is a riot in one of his last film roles  the stories go that he was plagued by pneumonia on the set of this film and died from complications soon afterwards but that did not stop him from playing the part of a slightly eccentric somewhat snooty but always likable scholar to absolute perfection. The opening scenes are great fun going from Black Mass to psychedelic 60s party bordering on orgy within minutes. You won't be bored by the visuals that's for sure. The story may not be anything new but it is cleverly told and seems always fresh and bright for all that the film is 40 years old. The performances are really great and the characters are truly likable even the bad guys. It's not an easy film to find but if you can grab it. It's worth seeing even if only once.".

And of course there's a dodgy chauffeur who goes around shooting at things in the woods including 'our' man and who so happens to be mute and an even stranger caretaker. Them there's loads of kaleidoscopic hallucinatory nightmares with electronically distorted sound FX that our Robert suffers which are interesting at least. Then he toddles off sleepwalking down to the local graveyard.It's all hoary nonsense of course but whilst a bit dated there's enough interesting characters played by interesting  andor sexy people if you get my drift for the film to remain entertaining and enjoyable.I'd give the actual film 510 for its real merit and maybe 7 for the other entertainment aspects as I've outlined.

	schema:reviewBody "Boris Karloff was a wonderful actor and amazing guyespecially since he kept appearing in films well after death! If you check IMDb you'll see three films that all came out AFTER he died in February 1969. This film while released in the UK in 1968 was released in the US in 1970making it a fourth postmortem film Karloff made! Much of the reason for this is that late in life the man made a ton of guest appearances in cheesy horror films since he was a big name and apparently would work for little money. A few of these late appearances like TARGETS were exceptional films and many like CHILDREN OF BLOOD were cheap Mexican productions that should have embarrassed Karloff. I can only assume he really really needed the money as he was confined to a wheelchair for many of these filmsthough he could walk about a bit if needed.CRIMSON ALTAR is a postdeath film that falls between the bad ones and the exceptional ones. It has the benefit of good supporting acting from Christopher Lee but isn't as original or cool as TARGETS a very underappreciated classic but is a genuinely chilling and interesting tale about witchcraft.The film begins with a witch trial back in the good old days. After the witch is roasted to a crackly perfection the scene switches to the present time. A man is concerned because his brother was visiting a town the same one that held this witch trial and has disappeared so he goes there in search of clues. And naturally given the cast it isn't surprising when it turns out that there is a cult that worships this dead witch and they are responsible for the brother's disappearance.The film has many red herringsfalse leads and twists. Many of them are very good though the end almost seemed like it was concocted at the last minute. Still there were enough chills and excitement to merit watching this filmparticularly if you are a fan of Karloff or Lee.By the way get a look at the guy with antlers and a leather thong the goatman as well as the sexy green witch! You just have to see themtrust me.".

	schema:reviewBody "...was the response by Mr. Manning to Eve Morley commenting on the creepiness of the old house. And indeed Boris does pop up later. More on that in a moment. First The Curse of the Crimson Altar and its US counterpart The Crimson Cult is an interesting blend of late 60s culture with traditional British horror storytelling. A young antiques dealer is looking for his brother and finds that he had been staying at an old manor in a town celebrating the trial of a hugely famous with of the region named Lavinia. From there intrigue with the inhabitants of the house  a barely audible Micheal Gough as a servant Christopher Lee as the owner Boris Karloff as a professor of witchcraft with his mute wheelchairrolling aide Virginia Weatherell as a love interest to Manning and a darkly lit massive old house  begin to ensue. Well the story concerns Manning being one of the last surviving relatives of the men that persecuted poor old Lavinia. You know what someone wants to do to him  but who can it be? The levelheaded Lee looking very urbane and being the personification of English gentry? The wheelchairridden Karloff pronouncing lines with such venom and twisted smiles as to scare off even a teenager? Maybe the girl  maybe she is more than the simple innocent charming persona that she exudes? What about Manning's dreams  where we are introduced to them with a red circle circling over and over until we find ourselves with him in a room where a greenfaced Barbara Steele with rams horns on head tries to force Manningin a robe to sign some book whilst a cast of characters judge him  several barely clothed like the womanvery fetching outfit I must confesswith the whip. By the film's end we get an explanation and it is in no way complete or satisfactory. The end really doesn't make much sense. But it really doesn't matter because the scenery is both beautifully filmed and chewed by some of the best. Gough is great in his small role. Steele is lovely and creepy. Lee and Karloff bring this film to another level with their performances. Lee gives his standard British upper lip jobwhich is always a cut above most's best. But Karloff  around 80 in a wheelchair and on oxygenyou don't see this in the film with a incredibly bad back  gives one heck of a creepy performance with what little he has to work with here. He has some wonderful scenes extolling the virtues of savoring a good brandy with Mark EdenManning. He also has this delicious line about instrumenys of torture and looks and acts so creepy that I just loved every moment of his screen time  particularly those he shared with Lee his very good friend. While The Crimson Cult is not a great film  perhaps a borderline good film  it is a good film to watch for I don't know where else one can see Karloff Lee Steele and don't forget Gough all in the same film. Forget it doesn't make much sense at all. Forget the crude 60s references and scenes of hallucinations and semiclad women partyingokay maybe don't forget that too terribly quickly.".

Robert romances Morley's niece Eve and is aided by occult expert Prof. Marsh Boris Karloff but it is up to him to repel Morley's evil designs.Boris Karloff became ill with pneumonia while shooting this project in the freezing rain. It was his last British feature begun January 22 1968 and he would recover enough to shoot four Mexican features in May 1968 his final screen work. Barbara Steele is always a treat and she is especially interesting with green skin and a large feathery hat if you can call that a hat.Loosely based off of H. P. Lovecraft's Dreams in the Witch House how does it stack up to the Stuart Gordon version forty years later? Honestly you cannot even compare them. If there is a connection it is very limited. There is a witch there are dreams but the two films are worlds apart.Howard Maxford calls the film dated and somewhat slow having a better cast than it deserves. How a film that runs only 87 minutes can be slow is a legitimate question. Ivan Butler also feels the film falls short saying the promise of a combination of Lee Karloff and Barbara Steele is not fulfilled. These are fair assessments.I recommend the film for the cast and the awesome organ track that opens the film. Beyond that it is hit and miss and you could skip it.".

It's actually very good with some great nightmarish imagery for a British horror great acting and a few interesting twists.Tigon produced a few horror films back in the day. Among their works are THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR THE BEAST IN THE CELLAR VIRGIN WITCH WITCHFINDER GENERAL and THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW. It's the last two of these that are the most wellknown and considered their best. I beg to differ though since I consider CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR to be their best film.The story concerns an antiques dealer called Robert Manning who goes to a house in the countryside in search of his brother. He's in for a few surprises when he gets there.This is one of those British horror films with lots of dialogue and seemingly little action. But the script is well put together and the film holds your attention. It helps that the film makes use of the great talents of Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee two horror legends who don't disappoint. The hardest part of this film was getting Mark Eden an actor not known for appearing in horror films to carry it. But he pulls it off very well. Also appearing is the legendary Barbara Steele who is famous for starring in a number of Italian horror films in the 1960s. She is arguably at her best in this film though playing the villainess in the form of a witch named Lavinia Morley.There is a creepy vibe running through the film much of the time. This is helped in part by the choice of musical cues and the air of mystery surrounding the manor house and its occupants. The nightmare sequences are particularly effective and director Vernon Sewell does a great job in his work generally.Overall CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR is a very underrated film from a lesser known British film production company. It showed that Tigon at their best could compete with the better known Hammer and Amicus at making horror films.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has been rather unfairly rated on this site. It's hardly a horror classic but The Curse of the Crimson Alter boasts a strong horror cast a nice storyline and an atmosphere borrowed from one of Hammer Horror's many successes. When you look at all elements to be honest it should have been a lot better but you cant expect too much from a sixties low budget horror movie and this film delivers one and a half hours of fun. Usually with this sort of film if it bills two or more big actors you can expect to see them for all of about five minutes. However this movie stands out because the film's two big heavyweights Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee appear for quite a while and while they don't exactly 'star' in the film their big billing is justified by the amount of time that they appear in the film for. Joining these two is cult beauty Barbara Steele who basically reprises her role from the Mario Bava masterpiece 'Black Sunday'. She stars as a witch that was burned at the stake but not before putting a curse on the descendants of the people who killed her. We pick up the story when one of those descendants travels to the town to find his brother.While Curse of the Crimson Alter doesn't offer us anything new where the story is concerned if I had a pound for every witch curse movie ever made... it still manages to add some verve and imagination to the familiar plot. Not a great deal mind but enough to keep it an interesting ride throughout. The atmosphere is well done and while it's obvious that the film only had a small budget to work with it makes the best of it and the house at the centre of the film makes for a nice location to film a horror movie. The two biggest billed stars Karloff and Lee haven't been given characters that require them to really flex their acting muscles but even on autopilot these two great thespians are able to show what it is about them that makes them so important to the horror genre on the whole. It's obvious that the people who put this movie together wanted to ensure that it had everything about it that made Hammer's films a success and although it doesn't quite capture the high camp style it does well enough to ensure that it's still a fun movie. On the whole it's not great but fans of this sort of stuff will no doubt find something to like.".

The atmosphere is well done and while it's obvious that the film only had a small budget to work with it makes the best of it and the house at the centre of the film makes for a nice location to film a horror movie. The two biggest billed stars Karloff and Lee haven't been given characters that require them to really flex their acting muscles but even on autopilot these two great thespians are able to show what it is about them that makes them so important to the horror genre on the whole. It's obvious that the people who put this movie together wanted to ensure that it had everything about it that made Hammer's films a success and although it doesn't quite capture the high camp style it does well enough to ensure that it's still a fun movie. On the whole it's not great but fans of this sort of stuff will no doubt find something to like.";

Robert senses something is up  does some investigation  doesn't like what he finds...This British production was directed by Vernon Sewell  I thought it was alright but wasn't that special. The script by Meryn Haisman Gerry Levy  Henry Lincoln was based on a H.P. Lovecraft story Dreams in the Witch House which by a complete  utter coincidence so was the second episode of Masters of Horror 2005 which I saw only a couple of days ago  while they both have certain similarities they are actually very different adaptation's  overall I'd say I prefer Curse of the Crimson Altar. The film moves along at a reasonable pace the character's are OK although a little underdeveloped the exploitation  horror levels are very low  while the IMDb's 'Alternate Versions' section claims there was additional S  M  nudity that was cut by it's American distributor I'm positive this is the version which is most readily available these days I doubt these scenes would make a massive difference. The story is played out like a mystery but it didn't quite grip or hook me the way a good mystery should the ending is absolutely terrible which just seems to leave things totally up in the air  if your going to start a huge fire in your own house wouldn't you at least get out before the place went up?Director Sewell does OK it has that unique British feel about it  it has some decent scenes especially whenever the witch Lavinia is on screen she actually looks very good painted green with an ornate horned  feathered headdress  steals every scene she's in. I'm not sure about the big beefy guy with a silly leather hood with antlers stuck on either side  a gay looking small leather apron which just looks daft. There's not many scares here but Curse of the Crimson Altar is all about the build up. Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any there's some skin on show but it's pretty mild stuff.Technically the film is fine with good production values decent special effects  it's well made throughout. It was apparently shot in Harrow Weald Middlesex in England in a house formerly owned by William Gilbert of the Gilbert  Sullivan musical partnership. The acting is solid  it's great to see so many horror stalwarts although the 'names' in the cast including Christopher Lee a wheelchair bound Boris Karloff Barbara Steele  Michael Gough are all somewhat underused.Curse of the Crimson Altar is a decent British horror film that probably tried to be modern at it's time of release so it hasn't dated that well  isn't as good as many of the Gothic period horror films that were produced in Britain during the 50's 60's  70's worth a watch but nothing spectacular.".

Plot sees Eden as Robert Manning who travels to the village of Greymarsh in search of his missing brother. What he finds however is a village of secrets.....and drugs of this group can produce the most complex hallucinations and under their influence it is possible by hypnosis to induce the subject to perform actions he would not normally commit extract from medical journalHmm so begins Curse of the Crimson Altar AKA The Crimson Cult maybe in an attempt to capture the drug taking hippie culture of the late 1970s? What transpires is a rather dull devilworship movie that wastes the actors on show whilst also trying to expand an hours worth of film into an hour and half. I really think that to enjoy this picture you need to yourself enter a drug induced altered state.More often than not many a horror fan can forgive illogical narratives and cheaply constructed sets and costumes but normally there is a good vibe to the production or some visual pleasures elsewhere. Helps too if the picture has a strong mystery element to it. Sadly away from the genre legend actors on show Sewell's movie has nothing to make one forgive it its flaws.The dream sequences induce smiles instead of chills as the underused Steele turns up in green paint there's lots of filler scenes that never amount to much and the finale is very weak. Throw in a schizophrenic music score that lurches from harp to low bass and then to organ without marrying up to the scenes and it's barely worth the time spent watching the damn thing.Karloff at 82 is the best thing in it in a wheelchair he puts his awesome voice to good use and gets to be part of the film's best passages of dialogue. Lee is on professional autopilot and Gough works real hard to make a routine butler character shifty and interesting. All in all quite frankly it's bitter disappointment and tough to recommend to anyone other than drug addled hippies. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is disappointing for numerous reasons. It's a disappointing entry within its genre that besides is a waste of its impressive cast.This is a late British horror movie of the more old fashioned sort. The sort of horror that started off during the '50's and got made big by mostly the Hammer studios. The sort of horror that is not always too well written and not with the most impressive sets or budget behind it but horror with an always great atmosphere and distinctive style to it which often made them a true pleasure to watch.You could tell that the era was nearing its end and was more or less over already. This movie is more consistent with other British horror movies from the late '60's which often focused on the far more psychological horror aspects rather than old school gore and scares. It's something you could more refer to as Gothic horror. Boris Karloff actually played in quite a lot of movies like this near the end of his career.And this movie actually was one of last ones. He died one year after the release of it and it was also quite sad to see how he had to play his role entirely in a wheelchair because of his declining health. Still he is one of the highlights of the movie. Not too many people know it but Karloff was actually one fine great actor who was capable of way more than just playing the Frankenstein monster.Of course it was also great to see him act along sides other great horror icons such as Christopher Lee Barbara Steele and Michael Gough. But it's not like their roles are that great really. The story is also not very consistent with any of its characters. Sometimes they disappear out of the story completely for a too long time.And here is one of the biggest problems of the movie its story. It's a quite messy one really that besides is lacking in some real good tension or mystery. The movie remains barely interesting enough to keep watching which is still mostly thanks to its compelling actors who still of course have some great screen presence. And the real horror lover will of course still get a kick out of it seeing the likes of Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee interacting and doing a scene together. This alone should be reason enough for them to go and watch this movie.However let me just warn you by saying that the movie itself isn't much good really.510 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

I can't even detect one lipsync if we didn't know that was Tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it isn't Sophia Loren. She does EVERYTHING with flair! Her dark makeup is fine and she brought the role to gorgeous life! The rest of the cast is wonderful as is that stunning ballet troupe. Most of the actors are excellent Loren truly marvelous. Her rival Amneris is also terrific. Whoever didn't care for this 1953 job is shamefully remiss. Verdi would have enjoyed it! Naturally Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early Sofia Loren film. She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953.I viewed this film because I wanted to see some of Sofia Loren's early work. I was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Surely today this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making. It actually became annoying watching Ms. Loren in skin color paint throughout the film.Yes this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie. Then the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent. I discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight.As beautiful as Ms. Loren was at age 19 and still is today the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage. After all we don't see beautiful young people on stage with old opera singers back stage singing from behind the curtain! Do not discount the success of using heavyweight opera singers. One only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company's product. This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced to date.The quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality. The color ink has faded much and that can not be helped.To improve this film on DVD the production company should add English language subtitles so that we who do not speak Italian can know what the lyrics are saying. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes.Watch this film not because of the story of Aida nor the fact that this is an opera. Aside from Ms. Sofia Loren none of her coactors are known nor remembered by this writer. Instead watch this movie if you are a fan of Ms. Loren and wish to see her at age 19  no matter what the production is.Larry from Illinois".

Wait! there is still Verdi's music allied to those wonderful voicesyes they are there if you like your opera in snatches and excerpts but if not you will quickly lose patience. For example I just happen to believe that one of the most glorious pieces of music is the Nume custode in the first act of Aida. Radames is in the temple and receives the sword and insignia which he dedicates to Ra for the forthcoming battle. The scene is a magnificent BassTenorChorus ensemble opera at its finest. Do not look for it in this film it is cut no tenor no chorus just a perfunctory handing over of the sword. Here you are son Cheers guvnor. No this will not do it is pretty dire stuff for any poor soul who thinks this might be a half decent stab at bringing opera to the screen".

This time Mel Ferrer is Stephen Orlac.  Ferrer actually does a pretty good job in this rather complex role of someone being torn apart not by the fact that he kills but rather by the thought that he sometimes thinks he must or will kill.  There is only one murder in this film so if action is your poison you might want to pass.  However despite the lack of action and any real budget in this film the film is rather good especially during the second half where the pace is picked up considerably.  Christopher Lee as a blackmailing magician is the real star of the film as he plays one of his oiliest slickest bad guys on film.  Lee oozes a kind of vitriolic charm as he maniacally laughs and speaks ever so nicely whilst blackmailing. Danny Carrel plays his lovely Frenchspeaking assistant with gusto charm and lusciousness.  The film has a good cast of character actors like Felix Alymer Donald Pleasance in a meaningless yet nice cameo and Sir Donald Wolfit in an equally small role.  Modernwhat passed for modern then music plays throughout.The film is markedly different from many other versions and in particular Mad Love.  It has an interesting twist ending.

	schema:reviewBody "This was one movie where acting of Hong Kong actors and Japanese actors interaction went extremely smooth. Usually in HK movie made in Japan have HK actor doing lion share of the dialog and Japanese actors are relegated to small roles where they speak only few simple Japanese words. Not this movie. It's amazing that the actors just went playing their role as if it was done in their native language and somehow it all looked natural.When you look at this movie its really difficult to tell who's the Japanese actor and who's from Hong Kong. Genetically all Asians must be pretty close to one another.In Cantonese version Yuen Bao is the main character but in the Japanese version Hiroshi Mikami is the main character. They wrote the script very cleverly that the two characters are interchangeable.Based on a comic by Makoto Ogino Peacock King or Kujyaku Oo is a good translation of the original comic into a movie. The original comic's ordinary person or situation suddenly morphing into a demonic entity is also translated well into this movie.I liked Narumi Yasuda's acting as a department worker suddenly finding herself embroiled in the world of Vajirayana Buddhism vs demons of the underworld.World looked really peaceful and healthy in Japan around the time this movie was made. It truly was the best of times.Really well made movie of its kind. It's a treat to watch.".

Usually in HK movie made in Japan have HK actor doing lion share of the dialog and Japanese actors are relegated to small roles where they speak only few simple Japanese words. Not this movie. It's amazing that the actors just went playing their role as if it was done in their native language and somehow it all looked natural.When you look at this movie its really difficult to tell who's the Japanese actor and who's from Hong Kong. Genetically all Asians must be pretty close to one another.In Cantonese version Yuen Bao is the main character but in the Japanese version Hiroshi Mikami is the main character. They wrote the script very cleverly that the two characters are interchangeable.Based on a comic by Makoto Ogino Peacock King or Kujyaku Oo is a good translation of the original comic into a movie. The original comic's ordinary person or situation suddenly morphing into a demonic entity is also translated well into this movie.I liked Narumi Yasuda's acting as a department worker suddenly finding herself embroiled in the world of Vajirayana Buddhism vs demons of the underworld.World looked really peaceful and healthy in Japan around the time this movie was made. It truly was the best of times.Really well made movie of its kind. It's a treat to watch.";

The story was relatively comprehensible but I was still somewhat perplexed for some unknown reason. Nam Nai Choi is one of my favorite directors ever because of his other films Story Of Ricky 7th Curse and The Cat so I am going to be lenient with this one. Why i like this one is because of the cinematography in which is Choi's greatest strengths considering he was a cinematographer for Shaw Brothers the special effects were actually cool as  the monsters were creative and the action was fun. And Gloria Yip too which I have a desire to put my nuts in her adorable face and butt! The pacing was sluggish but I don't care. Not his best movie but it is wacky fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Those expecting a kung fu epic  an expectation fuelled by the presence of martial arts supreme Yuen Biao  should look elsewhere as PEACOCK KING is a plotdriven story centring on an epic battle between holy men and demons. Although Yuen Biao takes centre stage as the fighterwizard monk his kung fu is in short supply and his battles against other men limited to one scene only. Instead this is a film where Biao performs flying kicks on evil demons spins in the air and uses all manner of magic spells to do his dirty work. The film is based on a Manga animation so it has some of the same kind of rubbery feel to it as THE STORY OF RICKY  and it's no surprise that director Ngai Kai Lam also helmed that other film. While Lam isn't much when it comes to the fight scenes  the one kung fu battle here is poorly shot bring back Sammo Hung  his taste for the eccentric and the gory comes to the fore when the demons arrive.The film is chockfull of special effects and they're surprisingly decent for a '80s movie. There's a ton of back projection  most impressive of all is a massive rising fortress of hell which grows out of the ground for over three FULL minutes  and all kinds of fireballs and lightning strikes which look great. The demons themselves  ranging from tiny to massive  are achieved mostly through stop motion a dated type of effect which I nevertheless enjoy whenever I see it put on screen. The effects are entertaining in a similar way to the effects used in the first two EVIL DEAD films.The storyline is in the typical adventure mould although a little more confusing than most. Biao teams up with with a Japanese rival monk Hiroshi Mikami having no fun in the 'straight man' role and the pair travel Asia battling all manner of monsters. Also lurking around are some familiar Hong Kong actors  Eddy Ko Philip Kwok Pauline Wong  and a delicate Gloria Yip then only 15 years old as the spectral Hell Virgin yes I don't know what that is either but it doesn't matter. Better still is Gordon Liu as a typically tough bald fighter his battle with Biao although not perfectly shot is one of the movie's highlights.The film's tone ranges wildly from offbeat comedy and general weirdness Yuen Biao battling a reanimated dinosaur JURASSIC PARK eat your heart out! to drama even a little romance. Imagine an Asian version of GHOSTBUSTERS but with faces ripped off and people impaled and torn to pieces or crushed and you'll be close. Things culminate in a genuinely spectacular showdown in the fortress of Hell where our heroes battle the massive King of Hell a huge humanoid chap who steps on people and breathes ice. He reminded me of Talos in JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS and he's a very good effect! Back projection is used here and it's perhaps the most convincing I've ever seen it done. All in all a great climax to what is an uneven but generally good movie.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Peacock King";
	schema:reviewBody "This was amongst the reasons why growing up in the 80s was cool with Hong Kong cinema at its heydays and with just about every genre that's covered. And for a kid growing up during the era Peacock King in my memory was one hell of a special effects extravaganza and showing off at the time what the East could do with special effects that the West have already accomplished with fantasy monsters coming to life with stop motion rubber suits and the likes similar to films such as Ghostbusters or Clash of the Titans which if viewed today looks dated but still contains a lot of charm.Alas The Peacock King somehow didn't withstand the test of time. A kid would have found the premise very interesting dealing with hell's gates and a hell virgin who held the key to the destruction of mankind once she heralds the return of the hell king and it is up to two monks to stop every conceivable devil in his or her tracks. Conveniently given that this is a Hong KongJapan coproduction the location of the hell's gates happen to be in Tokyo Hong Kong and in Tibet where the monks Peacock Yuen Biao and Lucky Fruit Migami Hiroshi meet by chance when they're sent by their masters Ku Fong Eddy Ko and Ji Ku Ken Ogata respectively to stop hell virgin Ashura Gloria Yip in her debut chaperoned by the evil witch Raga Pauline Wong Siu Fung to fulfill the former's destiny.However the storyline if viewed today as an adult consists of plenty of unnecessary sub plots and loopholes and characters who don't really serve a purpose. For instance there's the retail store's Okada Yasuda Narumi who's in this film just to balance the female quotient being more than a bother since she hangs around the monks and in my opinion seems more like a liability with her nonpowers as well as potential to trip things up. Moreover her character also presents an unlikely romance with Lucky Fruit so there isn't really a point to get her over to Hong Kong or Tibet once the Tokyo story arc is over.Then there's the waste of Gordon Liu's character Kubira a warrior sent on an assassination attempt on our heroes if only to allow for a backstory to tell of how the two lead characters are linked together in a twist of fate and to provide for more credible fight sequences using bona fide kung fu balancing out the overreliance of special effects here. But Kubira's introduction gives additional time to Ken Ogata as the latter comes to the aid of his disciple during the final act in addition to brining a lot more unnamed characters into the fray for that increase in body count.Director Lam Ngai Kai may be questioned for his choice of inserting random English language music to make this truly a one of a kind international production but really the soundtrack stuck out like a sore thumb. Some filler scenes could also be done without since they pose a lot more unnecessary questions  an airplane shot means the heroes travel by air but how would they pass customs with their weapons and the bringing of a Hell Virgin as a passenger? Hmm. But I suppose such is the charm when watching it as a kid as you rarely question these points and take things at face value in it for the many special effects shots that pepper the movie.And in all honesty for that time they were well done with grotesque looking monsters given some air time to up the eerie quotient. Some are done for the sake of such as Peacock's exorcising of a few critters on the streets of Tokyo while others look really rubberized such as the dinosaurs in the shopping centre arcade. Raga's transformation was perhaps the highlight showing off the creativity of the filmmakers in making something really functionally ugly while the design of the Hell King was kept quite simple  that of a giant bald man.One would have expected the role of Peacock to provide a lot more visibility to Yuen Biao but sadly this wasn't really the case. He shares screen time with Lucky Fruit's Migami Hiroshi to contrast the opposites of both men  one the relaxed joker while the other a little bit more uptight to have to learn to cooperate with each other given an adversarial introduction in order to combine their strengths to save mankind. Gloria Yip as the Hell Virgin also didn't have much to do here other than to act cute when away from Raga and happen to be frolicking the Ocean Park theme park with Peacock for him to be convinced that she's nothing but an innocent child who's ruined by Fate to do the inevitable. There's not much of a character development in any character here other than the perfunctory scenes given that much of the 80 minutes got dedicated to battles mostly CG enhanced rather than to showcase real moves which is a pity.Revisiting Peacock King somehow marred that wonderful film that I had in my mind no doubt created by being awed as a kid. Watching it today made me realize it's quite a weak film with only dated special effects to boast about. and I wonder since some older classics have been remade by Hong Kong filmmakers whether anyone had thought about this manga inspired movie to be given an update as well. One can only hope.".

This is a supernatural tale neither funny nor scary but with lots of pretty bad special effects.The story is unclear and messy yet another example of the fact that Hong Kong commercial cinema has never discovered the importance of a clear plot. Action helpless women and funny effects seem to be all they think the audience wants.Also an already weak story is completely destroyed by the horrid English subtitles. Why can't they get someone who actually knows the language to at least rephrase the subtitles into something that makes sense? My theory is that the English subtitles are not for Western audiences at all but for those Asians who happen not to speak Mandarin or Cantonese or any of the other five Asian languages this DVD was subtitled in.Anyway a main reason to watch this movie is Gloria Yip perhaps the cutest Asian actress of all time. But she hardly has any lines here nor much of anything to do  you should catch her in Flying Dagger 1993 instead or Saviour of the Soul 1992.All in all this movie really hasn't got a lot going for it. Amazingly it spawned a sequel Saga of the Phoenix where the entire cast returned. I haven't seen it yet and truthfully I may not bother because it looks like it's more of exactly the same.Peacock King is yet another movie in which Yuen Biao is pretty much wasted. Why has he done so many bad movies? Was it just bad luck that none of them were hits or does he actually like this kind of thing?My rating 3 out of 10.".

Phillippe is defended by a Jewish lawyer Richard Pressburger who quickly comes to the conclusion that Judge Larcher is prejudiced against his client. This allegation prompts Larcher to warn Richard to continue defending his client or join him in the cell for contempt charges. The question remains will Richard continue to defend his client or give up this case as he probably realizes that there is no chance of a fair trial.";

And I queried why Phillipe took photos of his dead father when the head wound was not there when he went for help. Was he in shock? He appeared to be and also I feel felt a bit guilty about his father given he had had an argument with him prior to this. This is understandable.Some might again say Not another film about wartime Jews but the story has credibility. And it was just as well that Phillipe accepted the pardon and went to America.

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING  PLOT DISCUSSED  The jalsaghar is a great music hall in the mansion of the main character a scion of a great landowning family. It's almost all he has left of the Ray family's legacy. Over the years his land has been slowly eaten away by one of the great rivers of Bengal. But he still has the trappings of aristocracy  his retainers address him as Hujur my lord even his wealthy neighbour Ganguli addresses him as Thakurda paternal grandfather. He lives only for his jalsaghar where he can recreate his family's past glory and where he can still win a game of oneupmanship against Ganguli. Meanwhile Ganguli is upandcoming. He's a businessman the new aristocrat landpoor but cashrich. He gets electric lights for his house he gets a motor car the first in the region. Satyajit Ray the legendary director masterfully contrasts the hollowness of the old aristocrat with the shallowness of the new aristocrat. How is privilege earned? Who is due respect? What is worthy of pride? What will pride get you? These are the questions that are explored with subtlety. The focus of the film is the performance of Chhabi Biswas a legend of the Calcutta stage. An interesting aside  chhabi is Bengali for picture and biswas means belief. He fit the mold of a classic actor  temperamental undependable a raging alcoholic a master. Almost every scene is wholly dependent on him as he preens and boasts and rages and pines away for lost glory. When you read that Biswas was in real life completely tonedeaf his creation of a musiclover is an astonishing accomplishment both by him and by Satyajit Ray.".

It's almost all he has left of the Ray family's legacy. Over the years his land has been slowly eaten away by one of the great rivers of Bengal. But he still has the trappings of aristocracy  his retainers address him as Hujur my lord even his wealthy neighbour Ganguli addresses him as Thakurda paternal grandfather. He lives only for his jalsaghar where he can recreate his family's past glory and where he can still win a game of oneupmanship against Ganguli. Meanwhile Ganguli is upandcoming. He's a businessman the new aristocrat landpoor but cashrich. He gets electric lights for his house he gets a motor car the first in the region. Satyajit Ray the legendary director masterfully contrasts the hollowness of the old aristocrat with the shallowness of the new aristocrat. How is privilege earned? Who is due respect? What is worthy of pride? What will pride get you? These are the questions that are explored with subtlety. The focus of the film is the performance of Chhabi Biswas a legend of the Calcutta stage. An interesting aside  chhabi is Bengali for picture and biswas means belief. He fit the mold of a classic actor  temperamental undependable a raging alcoholic a master.

	schema:headline " A Potpourri of Vestiges Review Indian master filmmaker Satyajit Ray's profoundly evocative film that pays homage to classical Indian art forms";
	schema:reviewBody "Jalsaghar aka The Music Room is a 1958 drama film directed by master Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray. Based on a short story of the same name by Bangla writer Tarashankar Bandopadhyay Jalsaghar presents the tale of decline of a feudal lord in the preindependence India. Jalsaghar stars veteran Bangla actor Chhabi Biswas in the lead role of Huzur Biswambhar Roy. Huzur is the last of Zamindarsa dying breed of landlords who once formed the very basis of the Indian Feudal System. Huzur's glory days are over but his sense of superiority remains intact. He lives in the past neither acknowledging the present nor anticipating the future. He continues to be a servant of his refined tastes even as his coffers are getting empty.Jalsaghar was Ray's fourth film which he made after the commercial failure of Aparijitothe finally film in Ray's much acclaimed The Apu Trilogy. Ray had initially thought of making a commercial film based on some popular work of literature which would incorporate popular Indian music. But what eventually transpired was something that was totally different. It was more of an arthouse work than a commercial movie that Ray had initially intended to make. The movie failed to do well at the Indian boxoffice. But it received both critical and financial success in Europe and the US and helped Ray earn international reputation. The music of Jalsaghar was written by the Indian composer and sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Ali Khan who was encouraged by Ray to compose musical pieces that would gel well with the movie's dark and gloomy tone. The movie's melancholic musical composition and sombre art directionthe sublime use of mirrors chandeliers etc.gives it a Gothic feel in the vein of American FilmNoir films of the '40s and '50s.In Jalsaghar Ray highlights the perpetual conflict of tradition versus modernity while simultaneously examining the Indian caste system. Jalsaghar is a sublime work of cinema that having stood the test of time for over five decades continues to inspire the budding filmmakers as well as enthrall the audiences worldwide. Jalsaghar is widely regarded as Satyajit Ray's most evocative film. It serves to be a great means of getting acquainted with Ray's oeuvre. Jalsaghar with its universal motifs is also the most accessible of Ray's films especially for foreign viewers. Jalsaghar is not a movie that would woo a casual viewer. Restless viewers should best stay away from it. But a patient viewer would be thoroughly rewarded. The movie owing to its slow pace may pose impediments to the uninitiated viewer. Jalsaghar is a deeply thoughtprovoking work of cinema that demands multiple viewings. The movie is a must watch for every student of cinema. Jalsaghar.is an essential watch for all Satyajit Ray fans as well as those who understand and appreciate intelligent cinema. 1010A more indepth review of the film can be read athttpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The Newsweek magazine once asked Henri CartierBresson  the great French photographer considered to be the father of modern photojournalism  during an interview to name his favorite film. Bresson replied  Satyajit's Ray's 'The Music Rom'. An old film but one that made an indelible impression on my mind.The Music Room is a film that led to greatness by Satyajit Ray's devotion to a single mood elegiac. Ray isn't alone in sculpting this great piece. The acting by Chabi Biswas as the crumbling aristocrat Huzar Biswambhar Roy cinematography by Subrata Mitra and music direction by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely. The film adaptation of Tarashankar Banerjee's short story but instead of creating an exact adaptation Satyajit Ray gave his own spin to the film making music rather being an interlude an integral part of the screenplay. In Jalsaghar or The Music Room Ray examines the ageold conflict between the landed nobility and the rich without pedigree between those who dwell in the past and those who embrace the future. Using the same meticulous unforced style employed in his celebrated Apu TrilogyRay explores how one man's need for a pampered sumptuous lifestyle leads inexorably towards his complete ruin. It's a fascinating snapshot of Indian culture in the 1930s and a cautionary tale about the dangers of an inflated opinion of selfworth.Set in the 1930's with the emerging nouveau rich Roy is the last in a long of rich patriarchs stumbling as his estate diminishes but clinging till the end to his refined means. Roy lives in a mansion in the middle of a desert a symbol of his isolation from encroaching destitute. Roy is frequently filmed alone as are other subjects his dog horse elephant. The film begins with the elderly Zamindar landlord sitting alone staring blankly in his back garden overlooking a once proud space. He is served by one of his two humble and loyal servants. The story flashes back some 1520 years to a more glorious time when the younger Huzar with his young son Khoka and wife Padma the realistpragmatist to Huzar's idealism was the class of his region hosting luxurious concerts in his home. Huzar's centerpiece his ivory tower and final refuge from the external realityrealism is the titular music room. The room reflects the Huzar's pride his heirloom his inner soul. Ray draws us in spatially in concentric circles from the outer oasis to the backyard poolyard to the mansion to the music room and further yet the music room's stage. Likewise Mitra's camera often and nearly always in relation to Roy dollies inwards toward Roy. The movement not only serves to honor the character and make us feel more empathy toward him but counterpoints the film's mazelike construction. Chhabi Biswas gives a superb performance as the crumbling feudal landlord. Subrata Mitra's cinematography and music by Ustad Vilayat Khan all contribute immensely to create the atmosphere.  Music Room is a very visual film  there are numerous ingenious shots the insect dying in the glass the bliss of an elephant being bathed in the river the joy of the servants reopening the dusty music room the way the chandelier gets reflected in the wine glass revealing Huzur's states of mind  and the last scene where a spider crawls up the leg of his own portrait and a stirring dance sequence. The camera movements reinforce the character and highlight film's mazelike construction and Roy being trapped in his past. The Music Room remains as a majestic masterpiece of a man's monumental effort to cling to his illustrious legacy and hold his head high when his feet wither.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the fourth feature film directed by Satyajit Ray Jalsaghar we are treated to a magnificent spectacle of musical performances Hindu dance and a powerful film thrown some place in the mix. Jalsaghar tells the gloomy tale of a landlord living in Bengal whom has just lost his wife and beloved son in a horrid boating accident. The landlord Roy Chhabi Biswas takes to a basic role of silence and mourning by spending his days sitting aside his hookah to pass the time. Biswas is exceptional in his performance of Roy by revealing a side to the character of nearperfect emptiness in a human being he shows us what the empty body of a man can become.The film is a decorative wonder to watch and hear to any degree. A graceful and vivid use of cinematography brings out the rich and sweeping palace in which Roy spends his time. Various closeups of chandeliers and jewelry create a montage of empty wealth. Later on in the film when we are introduced to the many performances which will be carried out in the landlord's music room the film comes full circle as an audio delight as well. Beautiful Hindu compositions are performed in full length throughout sweepingmusic video like coverage scanning the pitchperfect vocalists on to the unique Indian instruments tooting away. As the music grows to inspire Roy to overcome his grief we grow along with Roy and feel the inspiration of the songs as well.Despite its depressing subject matter Jalsaghar is a great delight throughout its in entire runtime. Sympathizing with the victimized Roy as well as his loyal and motivational subjects you will really overcome an exquisite experience as the characters try to pick Roy's spirits up through words song and dance. Overall this is a mustsee film for anyone with a passion for film music or both although it is recommended you enter in good spirt.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is quite a bit that I admired about this Indian film however there are also a number of aspects that whether it be for objective or subjective reasons I did not particularly about it. On the positive side what the film has to say about excessive pride is interesting as are the motivations of the main character. The photography is fascinating not only because of the shots with mirrors but the general panning is effective too capturing well the excellent sets. Music is an element that I found applied very effectively at times to establish the mood however at other times it seemed inserted with little reason behind it. The high contrast prints are good for certain scenes such as the fireworks but the feel they generally provide is graininess which makes the film rather uncomfortable to look at. One of the aspects that I did not like at all was the way in which the story was told. The film is mostly collection of images threaded together rather than a series of connecting events. Some scenes such as the main character's son riding an elephant or watching a painter tend to disturb the flow of the plot. Another point is the supporting characters all of whom are either silly or just lightly developed but at least there is a good character at the center of the plot. It might also be a bit hard for those not familiar with Indian culture to decipher certain events. The last thing that I would complain about is however the final few minutes of the film in which performance is treated as more important than the character's reactions. So overall what can I say? Some seem to believe that this is a masterpiece and maybe it is but I myself simply cannot agree with that charge. I do however think that it is a good piece of cinema and I agree that it is deserving of respect. Even if one may not enjoy it there is enough to be appreciated here to make it a worthwhile watch.".

It's a movie that works on a dramatic level with its main character and makes all of his emotions and feeling come across very realistic and almost sensible.Of course the movie is not as stylized and perfectly put together as a big Hollywood movie from around the same time period but nevertheless Jalsaghar still is one fine put together movie by director Satyajit Ray. You can really tell he is a director that progressed over the years as he gained more and more experience recognition and money to work with.Really visually this movie is being great.

	schema:headline " A subtle look at ageing  the preIndependence Indian caste system";
	schema:reviewBody "This was seen in the monthly Foreign Film Series in a society for retired university KU peeps. This 1958 story is remarkably subtle about the advancing age and declining wealth of a higher caste Indian man a Zamindar landlord whose income from his inherited lands is dropping from the previous levels of his wealthy ancestors because increasing river floods have lessened his rentable property and income. He's unable to adjust his manner of living to either that change or simultaneous changes in the Indian economy that lead to new economic benefits and social mobility for many in lower castes. He's especially irritated at his nouveau riche lower caste new next door neighbor whose income comes from money lending rather than through inherited property and wealth he engages in expensive rival concerts which he cannot truly afford and these leave him even poorer. Through two extended flashbacks we learn he had been married and had a son 16? 18? both wife and son died together on a trip. So he's alone for many years. While Indian music is his primary comfort played in the music room of his palatial home he also begins to use it as his primary club against his upstart neighbor. As he ages we see his memory decline e.g. asking one of his two remaining servants What month is this? before he presents one last concert for invited guests and to belittle his rival his lower caste neighbor an included guest before he then embarks on an activity which leads to his death. Great examples of Indian music but the closed captions on the DVD we saw had white typelettering which sometimes was not very legible against its background. The movie also very subtly raises the question  to what extent is this person one's self or relative or friend going through parallel sequences in the getting old process?".

The story is about a wealthy man whose life is music and putting on parties for friends but he doesn't really enjoy the music he just does it to one up his neighbors who he feels in competition with... his wife and son go out in a storm and die not to return and he becomes a recluse in his castle and at the end of his life he puts on one more final concert. What I glean from it is a cautionary tale about how we live our lives to have passion and to share it openly with our loved ones and not to neglect them for pettiness. The film is amazing as a cautionary tale but I felt it could have shown some form of redemption in the end rather than racing out to regain something out of fear for his own mortality more so a sense of humility and love for his family he lost neglected all that time... I don't feel we see that in the film.".

What kept the film in my lineup was its direction by Satyajit Ray with Ray at the helm I couldn't believe the film could be bad. And I am very glad I finally gave this movie a chance. Here in 1920s India we meet the decadent landlord Roy Chhabi Biswas an idle man who finds himself threatened by changing times that allow people who weren't born to privilege to better themselves through hard work. Roy is a classic example of the type of person who doesn't appreciate what he has. He has squandered the goodwill of his lovely wife Padma Devi who would rather sleep in their son's room and though he enjoys his 13ish son Pinaki Sengupta he isn't willing to accompany the family on a sick call and he cavalierly calls them back home when bad weather threatens. Roy encounters the worst kind of karma for putting his love of leisure and music above all else. However along the way we are treated to three performances of classic Indian music and dance that are truly hypnotizing. I felt myself being skeptical of the strange sounds at first only to lose myself in their intriguing melodies and rhythms. Bravo to director Ray for filming these stunning sequences in their entirety!As in every Ray film that I have viewed there is a wealth of stunning imagery here...in the form of a ghostly white horse the family elephant which also serves as transportation and shocking imagery from the insect world. The film absolutely grips one's heart as we observe the toolatechastened patriarch clasping the body of his departed heir. This film takes some patience and focus but it is definitely worth the effort. Special praise should go to Kali Sarkar as Roy's intelligent and loyal servant and to the young Sengupta as a boy whose life is cut short in a cyclone. Both parts are small but powerfully played.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are not from India and find the cast system an insult to humanity and if you can tell music from noise or hypnotic sounds then you will probably as I have a more sensible view on this film and its virtues than an inbred Indian of the Brahman cast the most privileged cast. Actually you cannot really say that this film is a defense of the cast system but it is also not an attack on it. To attack the music in this film and call it noise is I admit to put your chin out. Real music is a mystery not something that you dance to. The mystery is how music can make a better human being of somebody who through the music reaches feelings so overwhelmed by goodness and humility that they sweep all that is evil out of a person as far as that person allows it and indeed experience the music.For sure and that is why it is always provoking to attack any noise calling itself music the mystery is not solved so that you can tell why this music makes you feel and why this other music does not make you feel. The part that has to do with memories can easily be sorted out and leave the mystery intact. This does not mean that the mystery cannot be solved or if it is solved is solved in such a way that it ceases to be a mystery which is expected by any solution of a mystery. We may understand a lot about why music makes us feel what we feel and still not be able to invent new music after some kind of formula. The kind of music that is done after formula will maybe make us dance but will not make us touch God.When judging music I judge the feelings awoken by it. People may call themselves music lovers and for sure have a music library that in quantity is most impressive but when they talk about music it is obvious that they understand something quite different to what those understand who cry to music because it is so moving. Maybe that is the most evident sign of a music lover crying to music because being deeply moved but it is by no means a sure sign because swines can also cry when they are not allowed to be as swinish as they want to be. On the whole though you can start your investigations with those who cry to music to come closer to understand the mystery of music.The music noise presented in this film is not something you cry to unless you have childhood memories connected to the music. It is a music however that easily puts you in a hypnotic state in which some interesting experiences are possible as for instance a deeper understanding of Indian way of life. But unless this way of life makes you cry per se you will not cry to this kind of music and only to its lyrics if these are touching enough.In all honesty I would now have to name music that has touched me to tears so that I can be attacked in turn. I will have to choose music without lyrics because that is what all this is about. Therefore it will be classical music.The Unfinished Symphony by Schubert. The Fifth Piano Concerto by Beethoven not all movements. The Sixth Symphony by Beethoven not all movements Interlude from Cavalleria Rusticana by Mascagni Nessun Dorma I don't know Italian so I put it here in spite of lyrics  and much more but not more than 20 hours of music at the most through out the history of man. Allowing lyrics to the music the number of hours is of course much larger.Back to the film. Well it left me rather cold i'm afraid. I have no sympathy for the rich.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying I hadn't heard of this film until my girlfriend rented it she's a film student at NYU. And judging by the cover and the title I had low expectations. So I was surprised to find a weird funny strangely beautiful movie wedged between the usual comingofage shenanigans. In a lot of ways it reminded me of my favorite writer Haruki Murakami in that the setting was banal but the plot and I use that word loosely was brimming with odd visual non sequiturs and tangents that were occasionally left dangling. There's a girl who has an affair with her teacher a burning cloud of smoke a killer in a white suit a series of car crashes kids who smoke everything in their kitchen to see what will get them stoned...the list goes on and on. But the thing is it almost all works! It's almost like magic realism albeit in a more grim apocalyptic setting. So if you're someone who likes linear films or films that follow all the rules you'll probably not like this. But if you're like me and you get bored of seeing the same thing over and over this feels pretty fresh. It definitely entertained me and stuck with me  especially the ending. Oh yeah and don't pay attention to the box. This movie has nothing in common with Juno or Donnie Darko which is scifi for Christ's sake. I have a feeling people latched on to that comment and let it color how they saw the story. So to sum up I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone but I was moved by it and enjoyed its shaggy poetic qualities and erratic twists and turns.1010 Lee".

So I was surprised to find a weird funny strangely beautiful movie wedged between the usual comingofage shenanigans. In a lot of ways it reminded me of my favorite writer Haruki Murakami in that the setting was banal but the plot and I use that word loosely was brimming with odd visual non sequiturs and tangents that were occasionally left dangling. There's a girl who has an affair with her teacher a burning cloud of smoke a killer in a white suit a series of car crashes kids who smoke everything in their kitchen to see what will get them stoned...the list goes on and on. But the thing is it almost all works! It's almost like magic realism albeit in a more grim apocalyptic setting. So if you're someone who likes linear films or films that follow all the rules you'll probably not like this. But if you're like me and you get bored of seeing the same thing over and over this feels pretty fresh. It definitely entertained me and stuck with me  especially the ending. Oh yeah and don't pay attention to the box. This movie has nothing in common with Juno or Donnie Darko which is scifi for Christ's sake. I have a feeling people latched on to that comment and let it color how they saw the story. So to sum up I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone but I was moved by it and enjoyed its shaggy poetic qualities and erratic twists and turns.1010 Lee";

Basically a teenage girl played by the slightlytooold for the role Kat Dennings arrives to a small town where kids keep getting killed an industrial fire won't stop burning and everyone does too many drugs. As someone who has spent time in some small American towns I could relate to the feeling. Though obviously the director is playing with the conventions here and adding a layer of menace melancholy and haze to the proceedings. So Kat's character decides to seduce her high school teacher played by the underrated Josh Lucas. They begin an affair and all is well until he instructs her to pretend to date a boy her age so the local yokels won't become suspicious. Needless to say it's all a lot of funalbeit dark funand things take some wild twists that suspend logic but are all the more enjoyable for it. I wish this movie had gotten the attention is deserveswas it even released?because it's by far the best work Kat Dennings has done and it's full of amazing images and sharp dialogue. Be advised this movie is an art film disguised as a teen movie. It's probably too ambitious for its own good and I can see why it might be passed over by many. But I think it'll be a cult classic and I was pleasantly surprised by the artistry that went into this little indie flick. Extra points for the powerful ending.".

His single mother Andie MacDowell is in constant fear of keeping her kids safe. The other characters should be able to handle themselves just fine. These are the best written characters I have ever seen in a high school film and yes I have seen Election.Mr. A is looking for motivation Thurston is looking for love and Caroline is just looking for something. This film takes those simple longings and puts them into something that looks and feels like a thriller. Originality is not to be feared. It should not be weird or offputting it should be celebrated.

But the unrelenting atmosphere the incredibly well written characters and the smart dialogue make Daydream Nation something you'll want to experience.

There she observes her fellow high school students get wasted on drugs out of boredom and people obsess over a serial killer who has yet to be caught. She becomes involved in 2 very different relationships with men out of boredom and the rest of the film explores the insecurities that everyone young and old experiences in life.

To this end there's a huge fire burning just outside the town and kids keep going missing. As if to distract herself from the hysteria Kat Dennings begins an affair with her teacher Josh Lucas looking great btw and things go a little crazy and awkward and funny from there.

It had an awesome ending and was surprising. Superstylish too with music that I actually like. I thought it might get superdark but it actually was positive not a spoiler.

It had an awesome ending and was surprising. Superstylish too with music that I actually like. I thought it might get superdark but it actually was positive not a spoiler. I know its a small movie but its hard to find information about it and I've been telling friends its so good. Will it play in San Francisco?";

Did I miss something deeply symbolic with the fire or is it really just completely pointless? The acting itself is good and nice to see Andie MacDowell again where has she been hiding all this time? but good acting can't save a story that sucks.

The performances are quite goodand the movie drag you inside but that's it. Don't expect anything revolutionary or inspiring except for having 2 hours fun.

Daydream Nation is one of those coming of age movies which seems so real and beautiful that you want to watch it for longest you can. The director has nicely incorporated coming of age drama with serial killer on the loose and industrial fire burning. Daydream Nation takes us to three different kinds of lives. Firstly into a young city girl Caroline who moves to a small town with her dad but unable to adjust with local teenagers as they are not as smart or intellectual like her. Secondly a lonely druggy boy Thurston who thinks he never got anything right and always looks for something good to happen in his life. Thirdly a 30 male teacher Barry who seems perfect from outside but is all broken from inside as his life doesn't turn out the way he hoped for. The collision of these three unlikely lives in the backdrop of serial killer on the loose and industrial fire burning is Daydream Nation. Kat Dennings gave an honest stealer performance she made her character realist and believable. It's amazing to see her bringing humor sorrow and bitchiness to the character with so much depth. Reece Thompson has always done something unusual and indie movies lovers defiantly know him from Rocket Science with Anna Kendrick. Reece Thompson defiantly surprised me yet again he was nave emo  druggy who is falling in love for the first time. Josh Lucas is always the pretty man who gets the girls easily even this time it happens but it also shows the other side of the perfect looking man. In supporting cast Andie MacDowell Rachel Blanchard Ted Whittall and especially Landon Liboiron were impressive. Overall a gripping coming of age movie which will leave a good long lasting effect.".

The plot mechanics are okay in that things are set up and developed and all resolved by the film's end. I was never bored or angry at the film. It's just that when I can spot the origins of every plot element and stylistic device as being ripped from a small pool of other films that are so wellknown and so recent I can't help but feel that I am watching a film with nothing to say and not even its voice in which to say it.Judged on its own it's an okay movie. Nothing really rings true but it also never really achieves any ambitious level of absurdity either. It feels like a cartoon trying to be deep or a thoughtful film trying too hard to make itself cute and quarky. Either way huge portions of the film end up feeling insincere. The film takes on some serious issues and plot lines but frequently backs down either through dismissive humour or by resolving those plot lines in an overly convenient way.Watching it I generally felt as indifferent to the film as the main character seems to feel to the people around her who's hearts are getting broken and who are getting killed by serial killers.".

	schema:reviewBody "A rebellious teenager is moved out of the big city to a small town which she hates. The only person she seems to connect with and like is her teacher. She seduces him and they have a fling. Things get complicated when a young man at her school takes a liking to her and she doesn't realize that she also likes him.That's the best way to describe this confused film. Daydream Nation has elements that work but it seems that too much was thrown together for it to feel like a completed and strong narrative. I found that the big city to small town element wasn't raised enough here. It's the catalyst that makes her do the things she does but it never fees as big an issue as it should. Daydream Nation has many of these things that should be more prominent. There are a lot of subplots that try to bring more depth to the town and the story. There is something about a serial killer roaming the streets killing young girls as well as some chemical fire that has people wearing masks. These are odd little things that ultimately have no baring on the bigger picture. It would be nice if handled properly but it feels more like a distraction. Kat Dennings plays the confused slutty girl. She puts on a face that she is powerful and in control of things but behind the scenes she is a scared little girl. When another classmate calls her a slut she laughs it off and then goes on to belittle the other girl. Showing us that those words have no power over her then once she is alone she cries in the bathroom stall. She's human confused and needs guidance but she won't admit it.Josh Lucas plays the teacher who is exactly like Denning's character. He gives a calm and intelligent manner on the surface but underneath he is needy and a coward. The slow reveal of this character is great and Lucas really plays the oddity of this weirdo well. Reece Thompson plays Thurston the young boy that likes Denning's character. He is a pothead who saw the death of one of his friends so he's not all there. Another character that is scared and doesn't know where to go with his life. The difference is that he doesn't hide behind a confident demeanor.One of the quotes for this movie compares it to Juno and Donnie Darko as if David Lynch were to direct it. Well it's not that weird. There are mentions of the end of the world which did remind me of Donnie Darko but that's about as far as it goes. I had a Dazed  Confused vibe from it minus the decadecoolnessparty vibe that Dazed and Confused has. Daydream Nation is a film that has too many things going on it confuses itself as to what story it wants to tell.".

Be more careful who you get involve with because maybe they're insecure troubled men that need you to stay sane or they might just be using you to cover an affair. The script is pretentious and boring especially in the way it tries to portray Kat Dennings as a 'mature' teenager. Honestly the things along with Denning's mediocre acting just gave me a headache the whole way through.The movie is actually quite depressing the small boring town the awkward adults and the deadend teenagers can't exactly be classed as a teen flick. The plot is confusing which could be confused with creativity cross cutting to random times in random order.To be fair other actors weren't so bad and actually quite convincing. The cinematography and art direction were also very good making it less painful to watch. The movie is entertaining if you're looking for a silly romance go ahead.".

Then again the tones and flavors of the films are completely different with Juno being much more straight ahead funny and this movie being darker and more sexual though I definitely had some laughs.

Long periods of silence with only stirring music or even just the background sounds of everyday life give the scant dialogue secondary importance. It is testament to the power of the selfcontained plot.At the close of the film we see Uma the faithful husband beholding Doya in an ethereallysunlit bedroom. She is in despair. We can be forgiven for thinking that he is seeing her ghost or even that the film is about to take a farfetched fantastical turn. But no the director is simply bombarding us with flooding light the film ends moments later with Doya's panicked flight into the mist.As a climax to graduallyescalating tension through the film the ending feels both open to interpretation whilst also having a dark sobering finality. In fleeing Doya may succeed in liberating herself from her situation and regaining her individuality. On the other hand it could be a crazed act of desperation condemning her to inescapable turmoil and suffering now irreparably damaged by the effects of her 'deification'  the religious superstition and fanaticism set in motion by her fatherinlaw but which has spread so quickly through the community.This film in its slowpaced but mesmerising simplicity is sublime. In 2001 fortyone years after its release the lead actress Sharmila Tagore discussed the film in an interview with Nasreen Munni KabirI was only fourteen when I acted in Devi so we did the filming during my summer holidays. Sometimes the lighting took a long time to set up and dealing with the physical tiredness of sitting still I found myself fitting into the character. I BECAME the character. The key to that kind of performance is not to think it is to suspend thought and just to be. I had to empty my mind of everything and just allow Doya to take over. She is not a thinking person but a feeling person. It is all filmed in closeups so the face begins to haunt the viewer.Something once happened on set when we were filming in a studio in Calcutta. In a scene where the girl is sitting there everybody worshipping her as Devi a very old man came and prostrated himself before me. It was such a strange eerie experience. I immediately understood how Doya must be feeling.To accept it all as realistic you have to understand nineteenth century Bengal. Patriarchy was paramount. Orthodoxy and superstition were also very deeply entrenched. At the same time though rationalism was just beginning to raise its head but it was too timid to confront the strong orthodoxy the father was the head of the family. Nobody could question him. Please your father and you please the gods remarks the brother in law.All Ray's films are culturally specific and yet they have a timeless quality. You can watch Devi in any era and relate to it depending on your own experience and your own evolution. I watch the film now and still see things I missed then.I would say that it is one my best performances. It was a complex role to play a challenge. It definitely remains my favourite film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Devi is one of Satyajit Ray's most compact films.  At 93 minutes it is his shortest feature and the story is one of his simplest to describe. In the 1830's young woman Doya lives in a mansion with her father and extended family.  Her husband works far away but plans to have Doya move with him soon.  On day Doya's father drops to her feet and proclaims that she is the reincarnation of the Goddess Kali.  At first Doya is skeptical but when a sick boy seems to be cured in her presence she too comes to believe that she is the Goddess.  Despite her husbands attempt to take her away from the house she stays.  When she is not able to cure a second sick boy her nephew she cannot handle the pressure and despite her husband's pleas runs away into the mist.Yet despite the seeming simplicity of the story line Devi is a complex work.  Aesthetically  Ray is able to use the space in an incredibly evocative manner.  In the beginning of the film the interiors of the mansion are shot in a relatively open manner and there seems to be a lot of space to move around.  As the film progresses the shots get tighter and there seems to be less space.  This contrasts with all the exterior sequences which are shot using a greater degree of long shots.  Yet this is not a simplistic visual statement by Ray that suggests that the indoor are confining while the outdoors represents freedom.  In fact the outdoors too is confining for along with the open space come oppressive mists and clouds as well as the tendency to have the characters draped in shadow. It's as if Ray is saying there is nowhere for these characters to go no escape from their fate.At the end of the film when Doya runs away she is enshrouded in mist leaving it ambiguous as to what will happen to her and certainly suggesting that she has not found escape.  Although in most plot summaries it is stated that Doya dies in the end that did not seem to be case with the print that I saw.  Perhaps the other writers were thinking of the original story.  In any case by having Doya run away into the mists Ray makes a more powerful statement than if he were to have her simply die.  By dying we know that although this was the tragic result of her father pressuring her into believing she was the Goddess she has found some release.  By having Doya running away into the mist Ray creates a much more chilling conclusion for we know that Doya might never be able to undo the damage that has been done.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1860's Bengal wealthy powerful yet mentally fragile landowner Kalikinkar Chhabi Biswas dreams that his daughterinlaw Doyamoyee Sharmila Tagore is the avatar of the Goddess of destruction Kali. He falls to his knees in front of her claiming that she embodies the living spirit of the muchfeared deity. When his son Umaprasad Soumitra Chatterjee returns from Calcutta after his school exams he is horrified to see that his wife is being worshipped by floods of people that have travelled to pray. He is unable to convince his father of his folly and Kalikinkar's influence eventually manages to convince Doya herself.Bengali director Satyajit Ray's sterling film shows the danger of idol worship and how easy this influence can spread to people in need of escapism. When a dying child is brought to her the small boy miraculously awakens apparently healed convincing everyone apart from her husband and the women of the household of Doya's power. The women remain unconvinced but as Kalikinkar is head of the household they have no choice but to worship exposing Indian's heavily matriarchal society and women's role as the 'Mother'. Kalikinkar refers to Doya as 'mother' before his dream and a beautiful song is heard from outside singing of adoration for the mother.The standout scene of Devi meaning 'The Goddess' captures Umaprasad's utter horror at the sight of Doya fitted out like a deity and confused at the new role flung upon her. There is little to no dialogue in the scene but Ray understands the power of silence in film. As Doya Tagore is so beautiful that you could almost mistake her for a goddess and she carries her performance at aged just 14 at time of filming with remarkable maturity. As Umaprasad enters the room and sees her for the first time they converse with their eyes and Doya gives a simple and subtle shake of the head. With fundamentalism so commonplace amongst most religions these days Devi is perhaps more relevant than ever and with that heartbreaking and memorable final shot still as powerful as it ever was.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

What follows is a fascinating multiangled look at the transitional Indian culture and MOST cultures frankly.

Although I couldn't feel the same kind of emotional connection with the characters in Devi that I felt in The Apu Trilogy this film was thoughtprovoking and very intriguing to watch.Devi dealt with a serious issue in Bengali society at the time in a mature manner and Ray's direction and cinematography for this film was just as superb as The Apu Trilogy. It starred Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore once again as a married couple like in Apur Sansar the final part of The Apu Trilogy. However whereas it was Soumitra who played the lead role in Apur Sansar this time it's Sharmila who plays the lead role in Devi. Her performance was very subtle for the first half but her delusional performance towards the end was very convincing. Overall I'd highly recommend this movie to any Satyajit Ray fan.810".

Doyamoyee is 17 and the two have been married for four years. They seem still to have the attraction of newlyweds for each other  yes it can happen even with an arranged marriage! Why do you need to go away for this kind of education she asks him. Umaprasad's father is a good and learned man he never needed that kind of an education and he has always done his duty to his family and to god. Doyamoyee and the father a widow have great regard for each other and while Umaprasad is away in the metropolis the father's regard for his young daughterinlaw grows slowly to what we might consider an extremely pathological level. Is there some sexual tension behind this astonishing behaviour? It's always possible. But don't be misled this film is not in any way about sex or perversity. All the outward manifestations of affection are very proper and correct in a Bengali context. A foot massage given by a young wife to her fatherinlaw is not considered an erotic act rather a dutiful one. This film is about the nature of devotion and duty. The father's level of devotion becomes dangerous to everyone in the household  for Doyamoyee for Umaprasad and for Umaprasad's elder brother Taraprasad and his wife Harasundari and their child. Umaprasad doesn't agree with his father Taraprasad probably doesn't Doyamoyee probably don't either. But what can be done? The father's devotion is perfectly logical in the context of tradition. How can Umaprasad speak against it? It will take courage. But courage to do what destroy his own father? There is a complex web of duties involved. How will Umaprasad do his duty to his father? his wife? Has the childless Doyamoyee failed in her duties to her husband? How will Harasundari do her duty to her fatherinlaw as well as to her husband and to her young son? All these questions are implied. As usual director Satyajit Ray applies a subtle hand  given an extraordinary situation what would you really do? How would you really behave? To westerners Umaprasad's reaction to his father's actions may be unbelievable. This is perhaps a difference in place in time. Put yourself in his shoes  devotion must be respected and duty must be done.".

If the audience is supposed to believe that their relationship is based on the heartthing you'll see what I'm talking about when you watch the film that's really dumb. Preity as always delivers a marvelous performance. Bhumika unsurprisingly is her bland self. Salman however is outstanding. His acting has improved by a quantum leap! His scenes are jawdropping wellacted. For the first ten months of 2004 I feel he deserves the best actor award for this movie. I've never seen such a talented Salman before. A.R.

Otherwise decent movie and worth watching.I also feel that the second ask could have been better developed.

The film's first half is just fun to watch. It is simple lovely and we are introduced to a nice couple played by Salman Khan and Preity Zinta. This part is heartwarming the story follows the couple's ordinary but enjoyable life. What makes this part particularly entertaining is the presence of the marvelous Preity Zinta who plays a young doctor named Pari and Salman Khan's wife. Zinta is as natural and likable as always and she plays her role with conviction and style in a way that when she's onscreen nothing else matters. But then the movie takes a drastic dramatic turn and instead of Zinta we are left with her heart and with a Bhoomika Chawla who plays one of her heart patients. Not only is it unoriginal it's terribly clichd. The story becomes awfully predictable uninspiring and melodramatic. Nothing against Bhoomika Chawla who was pretty good in the previous year's Tere Naam but she really looks bland here and she often displays a kind of laziness in her expressions that is very tiresome particularly when compared to the lively Preity Zinta whom she is supposed to replace. As for Salman he does a thoroughly good job but again more in the first half as the second one does let him down a bit. Dil Ne Jise Apna Kaha is not a horrible movie for it has its moments. The music is nothing special but the title track composed by master A.R. Rahman is quite nice. The final verdict is below average not recommended and sadly so.".

Salman Khan just didn't have the charm he had in Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. He appeared too busy showing off his muscles than actually attempting to make the audience believe he was capable of a loving relationship. Even worse was Bhoomika Chawla. Where did this girl come from and why has Bollywood allowed her to be on screen? She cannot act she has no presence and just stands there like a swollen lipped scarecrow. I think the film would have been saveable had a decent second actress been cast imagine Kajol or Rani Mukherjee. Then at least the interesting nature of the plot could be carried out. But alas once Preity left the film there was nothing left for the audience to be entertained with. Poor music and dance numbers as well and extremely week supporting cast.".

There are some downright bizarre directorial decisions too like a very ill conceived gay character who appears two thirds of the way into the film for basically no reason at all. The film lingers where it could pick up the pace and some important scenes could be expanded a bit more.

Although that's a positive endorsement of the filmit's rare that a film has me basically speechless afterward I usually suffer from logorrhea which sounds close enough to diarrhea that you could call it verbal flatulence instead if you likeit turned out to be quite a problem because we went to dinner right afterward and I had to give a lecture. I believe I was served some kind of raw beef and I have an exorbitant dry cleaning bill from the tomatoes and rotten eggs.But I won't bill directorcowriter Jessie Nelson because it's not her fault that her film is so powerful and so stunningly constructed that it made me monosyllabic. I can only blame myself for putting off watching her work for so long.I Am Sam begins with Sam Dawson Sean Penn at his job. He lives in Santa Monica and works at Starbucks. We can see that he's mentally retarded. He appears slightly autistic. Because of this he's given only menial tasks to do. Suddenly his boss tells him that he has to go. We see Sam running through the streets catching buses and so on to end up at a hospital. A woman is in labor and it turns out that he's the father but she wants nothing to do with him afterwardapparently it was something like a one night stand. She abandons him with the baby. Aided by a quartet of developmentally disabled friends and his agoraphobic neighbor Annie Cassell Dianne Wiest we see Sam doing his best to raise the girl Lucy Diamond Dawson eventually played by Dakota Fanningso named because Sam is a big Beatles fan. At least until he is accidentally arrested. Government officials question his ability to raise his daughter and I Am Sam becomes the tale of Sam's legal battle to retain custody of Lucy aided by high profile lawyer Rita Harrison Michelle Pfeiffer.I Am Sam will likely make you say Wow! afterward because it is a masterpiece on every artistic and technical level.All of the major cast members give one of the best performances of their careers and many of these actors have had a number of artistic triumphs on their rsums. Sean Penn is completely natural and believable as a developmentally disabled man. Two of the men playing his friends really were developmentally disabled having been found at L.A. Goal a nonprofit agency dedicated to helping such people through a variety of programs and it's next to impossible to tell them apart from the other actors. Nelson and her cowriter Kristine Johnson spent a lot of time at L.A. Goal doing research as did Penn. Pfeiffer perfectly executes a complex character who has to undergo a number of far reaching transformations and even a breakdown of sorts. As for Fanning I haven't seen her in a film yet where she didn't threaten to steal the whole thing from her senior much more experienced colleagues and during the filming of I Am Sam she was only 6 or 7. Wiest Richard Schiff Laura Dern and others also turn in very complex performances that convey characters with deep multifaceted histories despite their relatively little screen time.Nelson approaches the film with a number of unusual artistic and technical angles that all work wonderfully. The cinematography is mostly handheld work. Unlike similar attempts in films such as Lars Von Trier's Dogville 2003 the handheld work never feels affected or intrusive hereit's completely organic. The most common purpose of the unusual cinematography is to give the viewer almost a subjective sense of what it's like to be Sam to experience the world in the way he does. Cinematographer Elliot Davis moves his camera in a way closely mirrored with Sean Penn's movements. There's an additional emotional symbolism. When Sam is feeling agitated the camerawork is agitated. Likewise when Sam is confused pensive and so on. Davis shoots from a lot of unusual angles. All of them work.Nelson also has the editing lighting and production design match the aesthetic of the cinematography. The editing is sometimes very choppy but always feels natural just right for conveying Sam's experience. Sometimes there are odd incongruencies between sound and image or between temporal sequences. The lighting camera angles and production design often make some elements appropriately fantastical. The production design and costuming match not only Sam's world but other characters' worlds as well. Not one aspect of the film seems to have gone by without close examination and artistic justification.The music which largely consists of Beatles tunes performed by other artists fits the film perfectly. Sam and his friends are all a bit obsessed with the Beatles and apparently so were many L.A. Goal members when Nelson visited. The Beatles tunes exquisitely match the various moods of the film and the lyrics often complement emotions and actions.But even above all of that I Am Sam tells a heartwrenching story that's something of an exciting emotional rollercoaster. There are many humorous scenes often centered on Sam and his buddies going about the world with a kind of Winnie the Poohlike wisdom that seems more honest and admirable than most of the film's normal folks. Of course there are also many scenes that will require tissues for tears. And there's just about every emotion in between the two.Finally the film has a great message. Does parenting or general personal worth really hinge on intellectual ability and amassed knowledge? I don't think so. Parents who are very smart can have more than their share of flaws as we see with Pfeiffer's character early on. Plenty of us had parents who were smart enough but couldn't help us with our geometry homework. Love may not be all you need but it's definitely one of the major prerequisites.".

Of course there are also many scenes that will require tissues for tears. And there's just about every emotion in between the two.Finally the film has a great message. Does parenting or general personal worth really hinge on intellectual ability and amassed knowledge? I don't think so. Parents who are very smart can have more than their share of flaws as we see with Pfeiffer's character early on. Plenty of us had parents who were smart enough but couldn't help us with our geometry homework. Love may not be all you need but it's definitely one of the major prerequisites.";

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't been a fan of Sean Penn's since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Since that time nearly all his films have left me flat. In fact I nearly didn't watch this film since he was in it. What a loss it would have been if I'd missed it! I won't go into the story line since that's been reviewed a lot by others. The story is sort of a clich'd one and has been done before though not as well. The story isn't this film's strength anyway  it's the acting. Rarely have I seen a film with this much powerful acting. Penn's performance as Sam is brilliant! He must have studied autisticmentally challenged people to pull this performance off. I also want to mention how good Michele Pfeiffer was in this. Her character starts out as a hardhearted witch and ends up being very human thanks to her exposure to Sam. The change in her is gradual subtle and fun to watch. Sams friends very well played by Brad Silverman Joseph Rosenberg Stanley DeSantis and Doug Hutchinson are very important support characters. Laura Dern gives a stellar performance as Randy. Dakota Fanning as Lucy very nearly steals the show. This little actress has quite a career ahead of her I hope! This film is delicately balanced and has a good bit of humor interspersed with parts that will have even the most insensitive of you reaching for a tissue. The film has a sort of a sappy and somewhat surprising outcome but by this time any other ending would have been pretty much unacceptable to most people. This movie blew me away and I gave it a 9.".

After he accidentally has a daughter Dakota Fanning with a homeless woman who he names after the song Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. The woman leaves him and Sam is left to care for Lucy by himself. However when Lucy intentionally begins to hold back in school to prevent becoming smarter from her father child protective services takes her away and Sam must fight to obtain custody. He befriends a lawyer Rita Michelle Pfeiffer with a bad marriage and a son who she thinks hates her. Together Sam and Rita fight for Lucy's custody in a heartwrenching roller coaster of tears laughs and the overwhelming power of human spirit.This is all beside some of the most stunning performances I've ever seen in a film. Sean Penn is top of his game and gives an amazingly realistic performance as a disabled man without a single flaw. To this day it makes me furious he didn't win the Oscar. Dakota Fanning's premiere role is by far her greatest ever and at only six years old opened the eyes of actresses who've been in the business for years and basically screamed into their faces This is how acting is done. And Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a phenomenal incredibly realistic performance that will absolutely take your breath away.As the film progresses you will find yourself laughing one minute crying the next you WILL cry no matter how mature or old you are so make sure you have tissues the next moment tapping your foot along to the familiar Beatles tunes found throughout the movie even though they're covers and the next moment simply staring at the screen not believing your eyes and ears at how emotionally powerful a film can be.And after watching you won't want to ever give the DVD back to Blockbuster. If you don't at least give this movie a chance you will truly be missing out on one of the shiniest gems of modern cinema ever.".

The story of a mentally handicapped man fighting for custody of his seven year old daughter sounded intriguing but it starred Penn. But what a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be!Penn is actually very good in this role. He brings a realism to the character of Sam Dawson and portrays him sensitively and with real emotion. In fact I thought the only performance that was better than Penn's came not from Michelle Pfeiffer who disappointed me a bit actually but rather from little Dakota Fanning as Sam's daughter Lucy. She seemed so natural in this role and I would hope that we see more of her in the years to come. Pfeiffer on the other hand as Sam's lawyer Rita Harrison just didn't carry the role off that well and even the courtroom scenes to me lacked the tension one would have expected from such an emotionallyladen issue.The movie weakens in the last little bit going for the sappy and highly unrealistic ending  unrealistic particularly in the way Lucy's foster mother Laura Dern ends up handling the situation.Having said that I still enjoyed this movie very much. It's raised my assessment of Sean Penn's acting abilities and I would recommend it to others and would watch it again.710".

I will not elucidate too much on the plot points but the realism in this film is about as good as it gets. I understand that there are a sporadic few mentally challenged people who are able to conceive let alone have to go through the complicated initiative to raising a child singlehandedly. But then again there are many nonhandicapped people who are not adept to raising offspring. But in this day and age of unpredictability the situation depicted where the dominating factor gets the call to determine what's best for the welfare of the child who is unfortunately caught in the middle.Sean Penn who has played a cornucopia of performances over the the last 30 plus years plays the role of the titular character Sam Dawson a loving caring father and Beatles aficionado is raising his seven year old daughter Lucy Diamond Dakota Fanning. Penn played his role splendidly almost up there with other mentally challenged characters like Raymond Babbitt Dustin Hoffman Forrest Gump Tom Hanks and Mr. Bean Rowan Atkinson. Many performers though have attempted to play mentally disabled individuals but often times failed. Pen succeeds in keeping our interest through and he shows that even the most underfed minds are still humans and that nurturing a child is not rocket science all you need is loving heart and the will to step up deserves some kind of credibility think of all those deadbeat dads who abandon their kids and tell me who's incapable of rearing kids.Lovely Rita Harrison Williams Michelle Pfeiffer is a bigshot Civil Dispute Lawyer is not up to par with the roles she's played in the past but still succeeds to make this movie all the more special. She's very important in providing the message that not all the money in the world all the riches of our universe and all the fame that comes with it can never usurp the love of a child. The message is pretty obvious and it is something we can all take into deep thought.If there is one thing that really irks me about this movie was the very grim portrayal of the Social Service Department as an unmerciful group of corporate shrills who care nothing more then to take advantage to the easily vulnerable and to deprive him of the one person in this world he truly cares about and maybe the only person who cares about him. I get frustrated every time I see their smug faces but I guess every story needs an antagonists. I guess we've all had those snooping neighbours who calling Social Services for reasons justified or unjustified. And yes Social Services will always be scorned for getting involved in affairs that is not of their concern. And have built a solid reputation of breaking up families either for better or for worst either way it is 90 of the time negative.This is truly a very excellent and deserves special attention one must reconsider. The theme of I Am Sam will have you in laughter and tears but will tug at your heartstrings the whole way through. With legions of fan support of Sam's other mentally blocked friends and an agoraphobic neighbour played by Dianne West it illustrates that it's better to be loved by simplemind rather than not being loved at all.".

And have built a solid reputation of breaking up families either for better or for worst either way it is 90 of the time negative.This is truly a very excellent and deserves special attention one must reconsider. The theme of I Am Sam will have you in laughter and tears but will tug at your heartstrings the whole way through. With legions of fan support of Sam's other mentally blocked friends and an agoraphobic neighbour played by Dianne West it illustrates that it's better to be loved by simplemind rather than not being loved at all.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you're looking for a tearjerking emotionprovoking melodrama this is your first on the list. I am Sam is a sensational dramatic piece that will leave you with tears to wipe. In the film Sam Dawson Sean Penn is a mentally challenged single father who's left by as what it seems a one night stand homeless woman to raise his daughter LucyDakota Fanning. Despite of being a mentally retarded person Sam has a job working in a local Starbucks coffee store and has got friends with some what equal mental capacity. He's a sweet goodnatured and loving father to Lucy that is equally attached to him.Unfortunately a sordid twist of fate takes place in their paradise at Lucy's 7th birthday a social worker believes that Sam having the mental capacity of a 7yearold can't raise his child that is outgrowing him. Lucy is taken to a foster care temporarily as her father along with the help of his mentally challenged friends tries to find a highprofile attorney that can help him get his child back.After multiple attempts Sam manages to appoint an attorney Michelle Pfeiffer who only takes the job at first as a dare. Rita Harrison Michelle Pfeiffer is a successful busy lawyer that comes home to a cheating man and a son who hates her through the movie Sam and Rita develop a friendly relationship which is an eyeopening for Rita to value her family and be more involved in her son's life. Sam goes through a legal battle to retain custody of Lucy aided by his mentally challenged friends his agoraphobic neighbor Annie Cassell Diana Wiest and his high profile determined lawyer Michelle Pfeiffer.The film is enriched with major cast members that in turn give out one of their best performances in their career life. Most noticeably Sean Penn who initially visited L.A. Goal a center in Los Angeles for mentally handicapped persons as groundwork to his role. I was truly impressed with Sean Penn's performance on the set of I Am Sam and how well he managed his role and his dedication to it as he freely indulged in the character of Sam Dawson. For anyone who has Sean Penn as a favourite actor it's a must watch as it is easily his one of many remarkable performance and the stepping stone of his career. As for Michelle Pfeiffer I wouldn't expect any other actress to perform the role of Rita Harrison as beautifully good as Michelle did. It's a perfect fit to her character and she accurately embodied the character of Rita that possesses an exhausted illtempered work driven nature. Least but not last the amazing Dakota Fanning did a remarkable role on the set and by far one of her best performances as a child.The movie is Beatlesthemed as we first understand Sam's character as an impressive Beatlesknowledgeable person despite being retarded. He then names his child Lucy Diamond inspired from the Beatles song Lucy in the Diamond Sky. As a matter of fact Michelle Pfeiffer's character is named after the song Lovely Rita by the Beatles and her surname is that of a Beatles member George Harrison and if you noticed in the film Rita HarrisonMichelle Pfeiffer points that George Harrison was her favourite Beatle. In addition the background music mainly consists of Beatles music and other Beatles songs covered by various artists for certain rights. The film is sweeping in its beauty director Jessie Nelson did a great job in portraying her idea of I Am Sam into an absolutely wonderful movie especially after a 7 years of film directing drought. The cinematography is mostly handheld work as the Camera is always close by to Sam for the obvious reason of picturing Sam's movement in a subjective sense allowing the viewer to actually feel with the character and pensively translate his actions. It's a closer look to the mentally handicapped people's world that every act of their doing has an essence and that they are truly remarkable in their own special way.Lastly should a intellectual deficiency restrain one from raising his own child? We've all had a grandma or grandma that despite of their intelligence in life aspects had difficulty in helping their kids with their Geometry homework but does that alone hinder the child from having a well educated natural life? The movie has a great message that when it comes to parenting love is the most important thing and if that is present then it most certainly paves the way to a healthy parentchild relationship.".

First Sam Sean Penn is surrounded by his inner circle of friends who are also mentally handicapped and who come across much more believable probably because they are in real life. So Sean Penn's character 'Sam' stands out against his group of friends like a fish out of water trying to get in every speech and facial nuance that says 'hello I'm retarded'. Much like Nic Cage's depiction of O.C.D.'s in Matchstick Men Sam's daughter Lucy is a cute little girl it's hard not to like her. But she's just a little too 'Hollywood cute'. Michelle Pheiffer overacts first as her 'I am a beautiful female lawyer who has what it takes to win a case' to the understanding sensitive probono attorney who makes Sam's case to regain custody of Lucy her exclusive campaign all the while having to constantly push her hair out of her face in order to impart the facts of family court to Sam.By the end of the film Sam seems to have gotten smarter his verbal skills are quicker and it seems his thinking is faster. And his lawyer has predictably learned a lot of life lessons from helping Sam.Did anyone else think he 'borrowed' the exact same clothing from Dustin Hoffman's character Raymond in Rainman? Is is an unspoken rule that all mentally handicap men must dress in khaki jackets and pants that are 2 inches to short with white socks?".

He continues his menial job at Starbucks and with the help of neighbour Annie manages to raise an intelligent little girl in Lucy. However leading up to her seventh birthday Sam gets in trouble with the police over a simple mistake and his situation is brought to the attention of the authorities who remove Lucy from his care. Sam manages to get probono support from the efficient and rushed Rita Harrison and starts a challenging process to try and get Lucy back.It is good that Hollywood is able to put issues and ideas up on the screen like this but it is the way that it delivers these things that generally kills them. In this case it starts badly with us looking at Sam working away in a coffee shop and then coping with his new baby  it doesn't really look into this very much but just asks us to accept everything at face value. Then it gets to the court case and the unlikely twists that see Sam taken on by Rita and then sweetly stuttering and stumbling through the emotional turmoil as he tries to just reconnect to the thing he loves. It could have been an interesting look at the situation but instead it is too sickly simplistic and doesn't get to the heart of the characters  instead keeping things very superficial and slick. This is seen in everything from the writing right down to the choice of music which is annoyingly sentimental itself. It works on this level though but it is disappointing to see such a high profile film seemingly aim for the quality of a daytime TV movie which is where this will gradually move now that it has had its peak slot premiere.The cast are OK but the material isn't there for them. Penn deserves credit for taking it on and doing it so convincingly and he does it well but it is hard to get past the fact that he is doing mentally retarded rather than playing a character. In other films you would see his role as the simplistic one but here that is left to Pfeiffer to deliver and she fluffs it terribly. Her character is awful and there is little she can do with it other than be flustered be emotional or be professional  whatever the scene requires. Fanning is as good as ever a bit precocious of course but generally more able than many cute kids. Wiest has little to do while Dern has a thankless task as the stupid plot device required to produce the ending. Support from Schiff is good aside from the film giving his character very little sympathy and there are a few other familiar faces in there too.Overall though this is nothing more than a starry daytime TV movie. The debate that it could've sparked never comes out and instead it is simplistic sentimental and unconvincing. For some this level of ahh might suffice but it ignores the complexity of the situation and the fact that it is not as simple as the story here suggests is just rather patronising.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. With relentless emotional manipulation piled on top of wooden acting  a dreadful script. See how bad the world treats Sam. See how good this simpleton is to his daughter. How pure his love how corrupt  selfish the normal people are. Blah blah blah. Pass me that empty popcorn bag I'm gonna hurl.It isn't that the story hasn't got a point but that it is horrificaly overplayed the message being delivered in industrial amounts. It's like expecting a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee  getting 2lbs of sacharrine dumped in it instead.The clumsy manipulation isn't limited to the script with wooden cliched characterization  oh so obvious directorial  cinemagraphic tricks. Notice how the scenes are technicolor when Sam is with his daughter but have a cold blue almost monochrome color during the court scenes. Sublety seemsnot to be this film's strong point  wherever there is a chance to drive a point home with a sledgehammer the opportunity is taken to do so with obvious enthusiasm.Michele Pfiefer is normally watchable but this has to be her first role where I couldn't bear to look. She does her best with the part but ultimately the clunking story  dialogue leave her trying to shine while carrying a dead albatross round her neck. God only knows why she agreed to add this turkey to her resume. Maybe it seemed a good idea at the time. Maybe it simply paid well  the rent on her mansion was due.Sean Penn is simply diabolically bad unconvincing  puke inducing as Sam. Laura Dearn ambles through looking like she's smelt something bad. The rest of the cast simply wallow around subsumed by the crushing sentimentality.This whole film stinks. The one area where there is some very limited relief is the soundtrack where Beatles tunes are played. Even here this is spoiled for a start they're all pretty sub standard covers by other bands  even then we only get snatches.When you consider how many great film ideas never get anywhere you have to wonder just how this pile of poop ever got onto the screen. I gave it a 1 on the IMDB voting but I would have given it a big fat zero if I could have.".

It's like expecting a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee  getting 2lbs of sacharrine dumped in it instead.The clumsy manipulation isn't limited to the script with wooden cliched characterization  oh so obvious directorial  cinemagraphic tricks. Notice how the scenes are technicolor when Sam is with his daughter but have a cold blue almost monochrome color during the court scenes. Sublety seemsnot to be this film's strong point  wherever there is a chance to drive a point home with a sledgehammer the opportunity is taken to do so with obvious enthusiasm.Michele Pfiefer is normally watchable but this has to be her first role where I couldn't bear to look. She does her best with the part but ultimately the clunking story  dialogue leave her trying to shine while carrying a dead albatross round her neck. God only knows why she agreed to add this turkey to her resume. Maybe it seemed a good idea at the time. Maybe it simply paid well  the rent on her mansion was due.Sean Penn is simply diabolically bad unconvincing  puke inducing as Sam. Laura Dearn ambles through looking like she's smelt something bad. The rest of the cast simply wallow around subsumed by the crushing sentimentality.This whole film stinks. The one area where there is some very limited relief is the soundtrack where Beatles tunes are played. Even here this is spoiled for a start they're all pretty sub standard covers by other bands  even then we only get snatches.When you consider how many great film ideas never get anywhere you have to wonder just how this pile of poop ever got onto the screen. I gave it a 1 on the IMDB voting but I would have given it a big fat zero if I could have.";

	schema:headline " OVERALL A TOUCHING FILM WITH FLAWS";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie has flaws but this movie touched me.  Maybe its because I'm a father of a six yearold girl but I was moved by the love between father and daughter Sam and Lucy.  Sean Penn plays Sam a mentally challenged man that instantly becomes a single parent when the mother immediately abandons them when they leave the hospital.  He some how raises her with help from a neighbor played by Diane Wiest.  On her eighth birthday child protective services take her away from Sam.  It has become apparent that Lucy surpassed her father in intelligence and she is struggling to cope with classmates and friends making fun of Sam.  Can Sam adequately care for Lucy?  The whole time I was watching the answer was no.  This is where the movie fails. It did not convince me that this mentally challenged man that could not even eat at a Kip's Big Boy without freaking out because they did not have French pancakes could raise this child by himself.I am sure that Sean Penn's will get some accolades for his performance. However I felt that I had seen it before and I had seen it done better. He was adequate in the role but Leonardo DiCaprio did it better in What's Eating Gilbert Grape' and I even think that Mickey Rooney did it better in Bill'.  Penn's downfall could have been the character's lack of dept. Maybe if we had seen his childhood his relationship with his mother or the relationship with Lucy's mother it would have created a more believable role.  He does do well to show his love for Lucy.  The chemistry between Lucy and Sam is touching.  You had better take some tissue.The newcomer Dakota Fanning as Lucy was wonderful.  Lucy is cute and loveable.  She is the only thing right in Sam's life.  She is hope.  She is beautiful.  She is everything to Sam.  When she is taken away your heart will break.Michelle Pfeiffer as Rita the lawyer was a pleasant surprise.  Rita is so vain that she takes Sam's case just to save face in front of her colleagues. She is too busy even for her own family.  All she cares about is winning. She is heartless.  However she blossoms during the movie.  Sam opens her eyes.  She is like the butterfly that Lucy does a report on in school. She is the true hero of the movie.The music in the movie was great.  If you are a fan of the Beatles which most everyone is even if you may not realize it you will appreciate this movie.  The Beatles' songs convey a feeling of safety and comfort.  The songs are familiar and soothing.  In Sam's chaotic world the Beatles come through with a calming effect.  One of my all time favorite songs Across the Universe is used as well.Overall I think this movie comes through with heartfelt messages. However you will have to suspend belief and let yourself go with it.  Laura Dern also pops up with an excellent performance.  The final scenes were fresh and unexpected.  Thank God this movie did not stay in the courtroom!710".

	schema:reviewBody "Well that was not the greatest movie to spend sixfifty on. In the beginning I bit my lip with frustration. Toward the middle I was groaning inwardly. By the end I sat in my seat filled with shock ranting to my friends and anyone else who would listen.Obviously not enough research went into this film. Sam Sean Penn was an unrealistic character. The characters explained that he had autistic tendencies and was retarded. No. I have dealt intimately with autism living with someone who has it working at a daycare for children with it going to preschool in a class with well over half people with disabilities for over sixteen years and I can tell you that Sam is well off his marker. He is far too high functioning for some of his low functioning traits. In other words he becomes incredibly capable when the plotline requires it then appears to be quite low functioning at other times.He knows the Beatles like the back of his hand. Okay. I can go for that. But how does he apply the songs and life stories to and draw complex connections from the Beatles to his own life? How can he come up with these life lessons for his daughter and profound statements for just the right time Always set your dreams high Lucy. You need to leave your husband. You don't know what it's like when you try and you try and you try and you never get there!? So he is high functioning enough to do all that but he can't make a drink at Starbucks after many years there? He can't understand concepts simpler than the profound exclamations he makes?Some of the other disabled people in the movie were well done. However the man who the filmmakers apparently wanted to appear to have autism the one who kept rattling off movies and their release dates was a cheap Rain Man rip off but plausible. The largest problem with him however the thing that made me not believe in him was that he seemed capable of analyzing the characters in the movies of which he spoke. While this only happened once or twice it was enough to cause me frustration.Also there was very little to no background given. How did Sam have a baby? How did he hook up with a woman hooker or not? How did he raise a child alone except for the help of a woman who never leaves home for seven years? How did he know what diapers to buy? How how how? How did all of these plot holes sneak by? This only served to confuse viewers and give an unstable view of Sam's abilities. More hows were generated than answers.The best thing to come out of this movie was Dakota Fanning Lucy Sam's daughter. She was the most believable character and seemed to innately know how to act and react. Laura Dern Randy foster mother was also fantastic. She obviously just wanted the best for little Lucy. Sean Penn did the best he knew how for Sam but it just wasn't up to par. With a script that had adequate research a welldefined character with a welldefined disability and some more research on his part he would have fared much better.Many think this is just a movie and doesn't deserve harsh criticism but face it this is what the general public sees of disabilities. This is what the average person thinks about people with autism. They'll get their education about disabilities from movies like this one. And what they're seeing is a false image. I'm so sick of seeing autism misrepresented in cinema.If you want to see a good drama that deals with disabilities Rain Man is the best. Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of autistic savant Raymond is dead onI believed that he was autistic. The next best is What's Eating Gilbert Grape?. Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent job with his autistic character Arnie a completely unrecognizable change from the DiCaprio in Titanic or Romeo and Juliet. If you do want to watch I Am Sam knock yourself out. Just don't waste any of your time believing it.".

For the safety of not getting blacklisted the 'contains spoiler' option is highlighted.It really is true Penn the never aging Michelle Pfeiffer and even childwomen Dakota Fanning and all of the support cast perform adequately in a cinematographywise well polished yet storywise highly emotionally manipulative skunk of a movie.And you know it's going to be manipulative from the get go when you understand the premise. Penn plays Sam a retarded man with the mental capacity of a 7 year old who somehow manages to impregnate a homeless women who in turn gives birth to Lucy played by Fanning. He raises her for 7 years until she mentally outgrows him at which point social services steps in.This if one didn't get it yet is a completely fictional scenario which could not have been happening in the real world. Unfortunately the movie is not a fairy tale it deals with the premise so seriously as to cover a complete legal trial taking place over several weeks if not months trying to establish something which shouldn't have to be established in the first place. Sam cannot take proper care for his daughter by himself and it doesn't even take the mental capacity of a 7 year old to understand this.When you watch the first 5 minutes of this film you know exactly where it is going given this premise and there will be little surprises on the path ahead it is done completely and utterly by the numbers. It's almost like it wasn't even written by a human being but by story writing software copying the successful gimmicks of the past.This really is a shame given the movie's strengths in a large number of areas including a decent screenplay considering the story arc written by Kristine Johnson and Jessie Nelson.But ultimately most movies will be judged on their weakest links if those weaknesses don't warrant some kind of leniency due to things like budget constraints. The weakest link is in the story itself and the manipulative way it is shamelessly presented.This movie scores a 7.4 on this website which means I'm in minority opinion. But if you are a person who hates being emotionally manipulated watching a film and let me assure you that you will be every 5 minutes or so I can't imagine you'll disagree with this review all that much.410".

Filmmakers Scott Glosserman and Nic Hill engagingly explore the history and cultural implications of one of the most traveled and referenced sites on the Internet. A whole range of opinion is expressed about the impact of Wikipedia on the archiving of learning from interviews with founder Jimmy Wales to commentators suspicious of the site's supposed neutrality. The documentary delves into the EssJay controversy in which a Wikipedian made false claims about his academic credentials and the battle over journalist John Seigenthaler's inaccurate entry. Evenhandedly weaving multiple perspectives about the impact of Wikipedia the film provokes a deeper conversation on how knowledge is formed and what future generations will learn about history and the world.";

Both attempt at first to be civil with each other but eventually they end up at each others throat bullying and threatening. It is a titanic emotional struggle that makes for a gripping drama flawlessly acted. I'm no big fan of Streep finding the adopted accents she employs in some of her films false and hollow but as the self righteous Nunzilla her pugnacious style and inflection rates with her Sophie's Choice performance. Hoffman has his work cut out for him to keep up with the formidable legend but he holds his own with equal footing.In supporting roles Amy Adams is very effective as the unintended go between Sister James.

Viola Davis as a troubled boy's mother has one lengthy powerful and painful scene that begins to tie loose ends together but offers no easy solution.Writer director John Patrick Shanley does an admirable job in keeping the plot nebulous with ambivalent scenes and peripheral characters that purposefully enhance the suspense. Scenes are tightly edited with sparse but effective dialog giving the film its steady pace. Other than some jarring oblique angle shots the camera compositions and set design provide a somber ambiance for the drama and an arena for the perfectly measured performances by two masters of the craft in this fight to the finish that remains absorbing from beginning to end.".

If ever there was a time in our country's recent history where that line carried the force of relevance it's now.And though it's set in the early 1960s roughly a year after the Kennedy assassination there's no doubt that John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his own PulitzerPrize winning stage play is a response to these dark times when the only thing that seems to be uniting Americans is their collective insecurity and everweakening belief that things are going to get better.At the center of Doubt is the mystery of whether or not a priest played by Philip Seymour Hoffman is guilty of taking advantage of an altar boy. The priest's primary and really sole prosecutor is Sister Aloysius the uberstern and terrifying principal of the Catholic school that provides Doubt its setting. Watching Hoffman and Streep spar is like watching two professional tennis players at their best and fans of expert movie acting should waste no time in seeing the sparks fly between these two. The movie purposely never clarifies the ambiguity of the charges  is Hoffman's priest truly guilty of something or is Sister Aloysius simply on a mad witch hunt? Streep's character is the most fascinating. From one perspective she's a nearly maniacal harpie intent on ruining a man's life and career for no clear reason. However if her accusations are legitimate she's a sort of hero demanding justice from a maledominated world that's willing to look the other way. Streep's performance is something fascinating to behold  she can convey more with an arched eyebrow than another actor can with his entire face.Amy Adams gets the pivotal role of a young innocent nun who first brings her suspicions about the priest to her superior and then sees them become Frankenstein's monster. In many ways Adams' character is us the audience placed in the position of having to come to a conclusion on our own when empirical evidence is lacking. Adams' role is the least showy but she does much with it.And then there's Viola Davis who in five minutes of screen time decimates the audience with some shocking conclusions of her own as the altar boy's mother. The insulated hushed world of the Catholic Church is blown wide open by this struggling mother who's seen more of the world than any of the priests and nuns sheltered behind the church's walls and who puts the film's running themes of racial and gender inequality into harsh perspective.The central conflict in Doubt in many ways comes down to each individual's view of the world and his or her ability to accept the ambiguity of day to day living. There's a lot about the world we will never know and much about our futures we'll never be able to control. So what's better  anticipating the worst and therefore being prepared when it comes or believing in the best and running the risk of being disappointed when it fails to arise? The movie just poses this question  it doesn't try to answer it. Doubt is not a fancy movie and will win no awards for its cinematic audacity. But in looking back at the movies of 2008 I imagine it will stand as one of the bestacted films of the year.Grade A".

The principal is Sister Aloysius a nun very strict about the discipline. The priest Father Flynn is just the opposite a very natural guy open to people and to the world. The nun suspects him of pedophilia. The suspicion will never be confirmed never thrown away. Eventually it's up to us to decide and our role of spectators is played in the movie by Sister James Amy Adams a younger nun who is trying to understand what really is oscillating between the two. By the way genial idea of using male names for the Catholic nuns to stress out the strictness of their rules.The case about the movie the epoch Doubt was made and the epoch the picture takes place are very different. The sixties were the years of Vatican II the Catholic Church was opening largely its windows. It was the conflict often brutal between new and tradition between progressives and conservatives. This was then. Today the Church is facing the scandals of pedophilia and the way they are handled by the Catholic hierarchy.So if we take the epoch of the sixties we take the side of Father Flynn a man open to modernity empathizing with the youth with their questions and their way of seeing the world speaking the language of his epoch a wonderful man suspected by a retrograde nun.Only the movie is made today for today's viewers and we are focused on today's issues. So here is the question once the nun had suspicions that the priest was a pedophile what was the right way to take? To not follow a case without positive evidence? Or by the contrary to follow the case to force him to come with proofs of his innocence? What was more important his right to privacy or the safety of the boys? We can say that the movie leaves the case open. Nothing demonstrates positively that the priest is a pedophile nothing demonstrates that he isn't.Well the movie brings something more what if? What if the boy is born with another orientation and the priest is just understanding and protecting him? Maybe just because the priest has the same orientation? There is a key scene in the movie the discussion between Sister Aloysius and the boy's mother wonderfully played by Viola Davis leading to an unexpected outcome.And I think here is the doubt the movie is putting forward more than the doubt of Sister James is Father Flynn an abominable pedophile beyond his openness? more even than the doubt of Sister Aloysius was she right in following a man without positive proofs? there is the doubt of humanity. Human behavior is complex each human case is unique and cannot be assimilated to a general pattern. Things aren't every time what they look like we should always consider this question what if?".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow! Incredible performances from Meryl Streep and Philip Seymore Hoffman. Mesmerizing intensity from Streep as the nun seeking to find Hoffman guilty of a sin he may or may not have committed. Amy Adams gives a sincere performance as the nun who sets the ball rolling with her suspicions that Hoffman may have molested a black student. The scenes between Streep and Hoffman crackle with intelligence and frightening intensity. Streep as the unrelenting figure of justice determined at any cost to destroy Hoffman is terrifying and unrelenting. Hoffman gives a performance less restrained and mannered than the one he gave in Capote and won the Oscar for and boy does he ever deserve to have won a second one for this outing. An absolute knockout nuanced and convincing in every way. What a masterful performance! John Patrick Shanley's script is riveting from start to finish. If anyone has any doubts about watching this movie due to the theme then put those doubts aside as the writing and acting are without doubt amongst the finest ever committed to film. A superb piece of work.".

Shanley's overwhelming screenplay is so effective and the element of mystery is carried out so strongly that even the viewer is left doubting the actions of the priest and the motives of the head nun were her accusations legitimate or was it all an intent to ruin the priest. His incredible direction takes us through the psyche of the four principle characters.Needless to say the outstanding performances are just the necessary requirements that Shanley has successfully met. After all who could ask for a better cast than Meryl Streep Philip Seymour Hoffman Amy Adams and Viola Davis? All these actors display some of the best acting of their career. It is both the dialogue delivery and the nonverbal gestures that strengthens the doubts in the viewers mind and makes the characters nonetheless more convincing.The slightly washedout colours give the look of the 60s but also adds to the mysterious atmosphere. 'Doubt' is a very thoughtprovoking film. It has one questioning. Should the nun have reacted or should she have waited for evidence? But what if it was already too late for evidence? What has doubt done to them? It has them questioning themselves constantly. It has stolen their sleep. We accept that it is human to doubt but what does doubt do to us? What kind of power does it hold above us? How do we react on it? When should we react on it? The director beautifully manages to convey and provoke this without appearing pretentious or preachy.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to a report commissioned by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops over four thousand clerics were accused of sexual abuse during the past fifty years. Although approximately thirty percent of these accusations were not investigated because they were unsubstantiated given the proclivity of the bishops to cover up these incidents the figures are widely suspected to be underestimated. What may be lost in the discussion of statistics about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church however is an understanding of the humanity of the people involved or the complexities of the circumstances.This factor is brought to light in Doubt John Patrick Shanley's filmed version of his Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winning stage play. Based on Shanley's personal experiences at Catholic School the film explores not only the issue of possible sexual abuse but conservative versus progressive religious values and how far one can rely on suspicion in the absence of proof. Set in 1964 one year after the Kennedy assassination Sister Aloysius Beauvier Meryl Streep is the dragon lady of St. Nicholas school in the Bronx. A strict taskmaster she relishes her role as the upholder of tradition rejecting such modern devices as ballpoint pens and the singing of secular songs at Christmas like Frosty the Snowman which she equates with pagan magic.Under Aloysius is the sweet and innocent Sister James Amy Adams whose easy going manner and charming personality is a welcome antidote to her authoritarian superior. The priest at St. Nicholas is Father Flynn Philip Seymour Hoffman who is the closest thing to a progressive at the school. He is open to new ideas and the changes initiated by Pope John XXIII being much more open and relaxed with the children and engaging them in sports and conversation. In his sermons he brings the language of religion into the twentieth century talking about the positive aspects of doubt and the injurious effects of gossip. Doubt he says can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty. When you are lost you are not alone. Resentful of the role of women in the Catholic Church and suspicious of Father Flynn Sister Aloysius assigns Sister James to keep an eye peeled for anything unusual in his conduct. Her fears appear justified when Sister James reports that Father Flynn asked Donald Miller Joseph Foster II the school's only AfricanAmerican student to a private conference in the rectory and was seen hanging up the boys undershirt in his locker. Sister James also informs her that there was alcohol on the boy's breath and that the boy seemed upset when returning to his desk.Although no inappropriate behavior was witnessed Sister Aloysius suspects wrongdoing and summons the priest to her office on the pretext of discussing the Christmas pageant. She accuses the priest of misconduct with the altar boy who denies that he gave altar wine to the boy or that anything unusual happened. The drama takes more twists and turns especially when Donald's mother Viola Davis raises Aloysius' eyebrows by suggesting that in spite of the allegations the boy who is due to enter high school in a few months may be better off in the hands of the priest than having to face his intolerant and abusive father.Doubt avoids easy answers and challenges us to view inflammatory issues from a broader perspective embracing the essential mystery of human behavior. The acting in the film is uniformly brilliant. Streep is mesmerizing even if at times more theatrical than may be necessary for the character. Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is more restrained and draws our sympathy with his broader view of church doctrine and display of love and compassion although his demeanor at the end tantalizingly suggests remorse.What may be the most noteworthy performance however is that of Viola Davis whose dialogue with Aloysius is one of the dramatic high points of the film. The issue of whether Father Flynn acted as a friend and mentor to the boy or a sexual partner is ultimately left to the viewer to resolve though what is beyond doubt is that absolute certainty without considering other points of view is a dead end for all involved.".

Sister Aloysius doesn't take any more kindly to the accoutrements of the modern world  she has banned all ballpoint pens from the premises and decries Frosty the Snowman as a celebration of pagan magic  than she does to the liberalizing effect Vatican II has had on the Church she views as the last bastion of morality in an increasingly permissive and immoral world. This puts her in direct conflict with Father Flynn a reformminded manofthepeople priest who is more concerned with his parishioners' needs than with church ritual per se  yet whom Sister Aloysius has reason to suspect might be a pedophile. Or is she simply targeting the man and seeing what she wants to see because his view of the Church is so at odds with her own? The third main character Sister James is a perpetually upbeat but generally nave novice who becomes more than a disinterested bystander in the warofwills that erupts between her two equally hardnosed superiors.In adapting his play to the screen writerdirector John Patrick Shanley hits on some intriguing themes revolving around certainty vs. doubt and traditionalism vs. progressivism but the movie isn't always as intellectually honest and convincing as one might wish it to be especially when Shanley indulges in such hokey effects as the winter wind batting against the windows or wellorchestrated thunder bolts crashing overhead at meaningful moments in the picture. Similarly the reactions the characters have to one another and the situation they're involved in don't always ring true given the less enlightened time period in which the story takes place. And the final transformative moment comes upon us with such abruptness and with so little preparation that it quite literally rings down the curtain on the entire enterprise.Yet despite all these flaws Doubt periodically rises to the occasion and does justice to the complexity of its subject matter. This is particularly the case in a searing scene between Sister Aloysius and the mother of one of the boys who may have fallen victim to Father Flynn's inappropriate conduct a scene that catches us completely offguard with its sheer unexpectedness and its paradigmshifting effect on the story.Moreover the performances are uniformly excellent starting with Meryl Streep who brings a surprising amount of humor and even warmth to a character who is for all intents and purposes cut off from her emotions by her dogmatically rigid nature. Phillip Seymour Hoffman effectively keeps us guessing as to the truth about his character never tipping his hand one way or the other as to what is taking place in the depths of his soul. Amy Adams makes a compelling standin for those of us in the audience who are trying to reserve judgment on these two characters before all the facts are revealed. Special note must also be taken of Viola Davis superb in her brief but unforgettable appearance as the mother who delivers an unsettling response to news that her son may have been the victim of a sexual predator.The movie seems to suggest that one can never have one hundred percent certitude about anything in this life and that actions must often be taken even when all the facts in a particular case can never be fully known. Yet what happens when such an action could result in the destruction of another person's livelihood and reputation? It's an interesting theme that is only sporadically well addressed by Doubt but the foodforthought that the movie provides makes it worth checking out anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "Doubt is almost a great film but it falls short on logic. The many 1010 ratings seem to refer more to what the film should have been than to what it turned out to be.For me the main problem is the trick that Meryl Streep's nun plays on Hoffman's priest  lying about calling a nun in his old parish. This seems to reveal with far too much certainty that the man is indeed guilty  of something. If he wasn't expelled from previous positions why does he not question the supposed phone call more strongly?

I was actually IN Catholic schools at about this time and I happen to know the real guilty party beyond any Doubt it was the Church as an institution. The film seems prepared to tackle this issue but again fails to carry through. We have the older nun representing the stiff traditional past. Contrasted with the priest who reflects the muchneeded modernization brought in by Pope John XXIII. Yet it's the priest who ends up in the wrong. What are we to make of this?And what about Meryl Streep's character  who quite accurately represents generations of venomous domineering nuns who terrorized small children  a legacy of institutionalized bullying that did easily as much harm overall as any priestly molestations. Do we hate her for the harm she does? Well it's not really shown. She's right every time she deals with a child and none show any obvious ill effects of her domination. Though I would suggest that in fact the film's characterizations are accurate Catholic schools tended to either crush children's will or turn them into obnoxious rebels. Both outcomes are represented in the film but the point of what we're seeing is not raised.With all this in mind Streep's final cry of Oh I'm so wracked with doubt! sounds very hollow indeed. What is she so doubtful about?? She has absolute certainty that the priest was guilty. Is she just agonizing over the methods she used to defeat him? Could it be that the real doubt in this movie is merely whether or not the ends justify the means?? If so how disappointing when so many other questions have been raised! And how uninteresting given that no real ill effects of her tactics are shown.Which brings us to the central dramatic failing of the film. The real pivotal character of this story is clearly that of the younger naive nun. She is the only character that undergoes a major transformation and hence begs to be spotlighted. Yet we are left entirely unclear as to how the events of the film have affected her. Has she been poisoned by the elder nun's harsh attitudes? Or has she absorbed the love and humor of the possibly flawed priest? Or ultimately can she find a middle course that would show a way forward for the Church due caution tempered with a love that puts the children's welfare first? Unfortunately the film's ending veers away from this THE key question and focuses on Streep's deeply uninteresting Doubt.It seems like Shanley set out to create one of those knife'sedge dramas where difficult questions are raised but not given absolute answers. But at some point he slipped off ending up not with ambivalence and Doubt but with logic that's just muddled. Or maybe the gaps were filled by material that ended up on the cutting room floor. I had the strong feeling the film wanted to be about fifteen minutes longer. A bit more exposition might have at least told us what we were supposed to be in Doubt about.On the positive side I'd say that the film looks terrific and the three! main performances are brilliant  even though constrained by by Shanley's confused script.".

	onyx:emotionText "Doubt is almost a great film but it falls short on logic. The many 1010 ratings seem to refer more to what the film should have been than to what it turned out to be.For me the main problem is the trick that Meryl Streep's nun plays on Hoffman's priest  lying about calling a nun in his old parish. This seems to reveal with far too much certainty that the man is indeed guilty  of something. If he wasn't expelled from previous positions why does he not question the supposed phone call more strongly?

I hate to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie but the end says it all. In the end Streep becomes a bad person. The movie tells us Father Flynn's next residence is larger and therefore puts more boys at greater risk not to mention that Streep.... Well I don't have to tell you if you want to watch it.I have another problem with the movie as to how it handled the Miller boy. The movie let's us believe one thing but the boy never shows any signs of being of a certain orientation only the word of his mother in close conversation. Was the movie's point that gay boys attract the pedophiles? That whole line was confusing and arguably underdeveloped. Point is if you're going to divulge the conversation with the Mother than something more has to be done with the subject matter even if it's closed off quickly.I can't recommend this movie except for the individual performances of Adams Seymour and Streep order by alpha or ind. rating take your pick. They were all fantastic. I just wish they had a better script with which to work.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the most unsettling movie I have seen in many years. Throughout the showing I found myself wandering back and forth between condemnation of the Priest's behaviour the Principal's behaviour and the behaviour of the young black student's Mother. The part of the traditional nun who is principal of a Catholic School is played perfectly by Meryl Streep. She's unhappy with change and views it almost as a loss of the comfort and peace of mind that comes with tradition. The part of the new Priest is played just as perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He views change in the way religion is practiced as absolutely essential and wants to see the iron fisted traditional rule of the principal disappear into the dark inflexible past where it belongs. Thus from the beginning of the movie there is a silent war between the two main characters. If you are a trusting and positive person you may find yourself believing that the new priest is a wonderful man who cares about nothing more than the religious health and happiness of the parishioners and young students of his church. The affection that he displays for the troubled young black student at the centre of the controversy is touching and absolutely appropriate. On the other hand if you are a more cynical person likely to be suspicious of any behaviour that strays from the reserved understanding that a priest traditionally expresses in a more sombre way to his parishioners and students then you may quickly decide that he is all of the things that the principal suspects him to be. In the end the principal wins out and succeeds in driving the new priest out of the parish. He moves on to another parish where he has greater responsibilities and enjoys a higher level of professional respect. But I the viewer am left wondering if the principal is a paranoid cast back to 17th century religious practices who victimizes a new priest simply because he represented change that she wasn't prepared to accept or if the new Priest actually is an abuser who took advantage of a young vulnerable boy who had no one to turn to for comfort but was ferreted out by a wise no nonsense adherent to purity in religion.".

	schema:headline " Free to interpretation of each who sits down to observe.";
	schema:reviewBody "Doubt as it is most commonly known in its many manifestations and  forms is often antagonised as a weakness or a fault in virtue. Yet  somewhat dubiously overlooked is its antithetic counterpart who comes  in the form of belief faith conviction or unwavering assertion.  Indeed how far will a person tread down a road guided only by their  intuition and trust in faith alone? These questions which in turn  reflect and pave way for many of Doubt's most potent and engaging  moments of narrative are of course brought up in the course of the  adapted play's screenplay but they are not answeredat least not  directly.  In fact rather ironically doubt is a feature that places the pieces  of the moral puzzle in question upright onto the table and then leaves  them there dangling and free to interpretation of each who sits down  to observe. This somewhat openended vague and subjective form of  cinematic expression is something that is rarely seen outside of art  houses and the most daring of filmmakers palettes. And yet  directorwriter and playwright John Patrick Shanley implements the  risky move here with ease and grace. Yet the real flavour despite  having plenty of potency within these realms lies outside of debating  suspicions and tests of virtuefirst and foremost doubt is a study of  human characters and how they can often clash as a result of their  diversities in opinions and temperaments.  The majority of Doubt's story then is central to three catalysts for  the script's themes to manifest and evolve. These three personas come  in the form of a reserved progressively adapted priest by the name of  Brendan Flynn Philip Seymour Hoffman a young brighteyed newcomer  nun named Sister James Amy Adams and a stern assertive and  conniving traditionalist nun named Aloysius Beauvier Meryl Streep.  While it would be of no fault of anyone to assume that the themes I  have mentioned thus far have everything and all to do with the question  of religious faith only this tangent however relevant and vital to the  backdrop of the story nevertheless serves as just thata backdrop.  Instead Doubt takes its intellectual conflict between heart and reason  in the form of a cloudy event involving father Flynn and a young  alterboy who takes a certain liking to the fatherlikefigure of the  priest. After hearing a notably unsure and reserved report from Sister  James Sister Beauvier asserts that she knows what is going on with  Flynn and that she's going to set everything straight.  But what then is her evidence? Not much. In fact aside from word of  mouth gossip you could decree from a young nave woman not sure  even of her own words Beauvier has nothing but her suspicion and  conviction to go on. From here on in then it is the sole intent of the  director to address the themes of doubt itself and its oppressor  being the Absolute Truth or so it is perceived by those who take heed  of its obvious presence. How Shanley delivers his story is nothing  short of engrossing however the whole structure of the play sees  characters sway from one end of the moral spectrum to the otherindeed  it's startling as a viewer to find such palpitating changes of heart  regarding characters.  Sure enough the whole affair comes across as overtly manipulative  because of the amount of ambiguity and twists and turns that Shanley  throws out there but taken in context of the movie's themes of  mistrust unfaltering conviction and the inability for compassionate  reevaluation Doubt reflects its ideas in the head of its viewer  without blatantly pointing out such shifts the emotional tugs are  indeed obvious but the strings pulling them are not.  Yet for all intents and purposes Doubt exists as a fine testament not  only to Shanley's ability as a filmmaker but also his ability to  direct his cast and to allow them to envelop the characters from  within his emotionally contorted monster. Taking forefront for obvious  reasons here are both Hoffman and Streep who deliver performances just  as convincing and engaging as their characters are written. Hoffman  himself has seen a vast array of roles specifically from 2008 which  have made him a figure to watch from here on in but Streep despite  her accolades from previous years has found herself in some lacklustre  roles as of late. Doubt then with its rich multidimensional  characters and interpersonal relations finds Streep back at home  embodying her persona with vigour and a conviction that always finds  the audience clamouring at her feet but not at the expense of  maintaining their attention.  It's a somewhat humble unassuming feature as a whole that will be  easily misinterpreted by a few but only a few. Instead those looking  for intelligent layered and tangible character drama laced with plenty  of thematic conjecture will find much to enjoy here. Of course there  is every reason to believe that the feature's lack of resolution or  clear objective stances will disgruntle those dimmed into expectations  of cathartic solidified resolvesbut this in turn is the point of  Doubt. Not only does it offer up food for thought intrigue the heart  and question the nature of our own convictions we may hold dear but it  also echoes those themes through its unavoidably ambiguous and  unknowing nature.  One thing that certainly is clear here however is that Doubt exists as  a complex significant feature brimming with subdued nuanced life and  important statements beyond which most cinematic fare avoids in favour  of comfortable solidified answers it's a bold statement and an  endlessly intriguing and engrossing one at that.".

	onyx:emotionText "Doubt as it is most commonly known in its many manifestations and  forms is often antagonised as a weakness or a fault in virtue. Yet  somewhat dubiously overlooked is its antithetic counterpart who comes  in the form of belief faith conviction or unwavering assertion.  Indeed how far will a person tread down a road guided only by their  intuition and trust in faith alone? These questions which in turn  reflect and pave way for many of Doubt's most potent and engaging  moments of narrative are of course brought up in the course of the  adapted play's screenplay but they are not answeredat least not  directly.  In fact rather ironically doubt is a feature that places the pieces  of the moral puzzle in question upright onto the table and then leaves  them there dangling and free to interpretation of each who sits down  to observe. This somewhat openended vague and subjective form of  cinematic expression is something that is rarely seen outside of art  houses and the most daring of filmmakers palettes. And yet  directorwriter and playwright John Patrick Shanley implements the  risky move here with ease and grace. Yet the real flavour despite  having plenty of potency within these realms lies outside of debating  suspicions and tests of virtuefirst and foremost doubt is a study of  human characters and how they can often clash as a result of their  diversities in opinions and temperaments.  The majority of Doubt's story then is central to three catalysts for  the script's themes to manifest and evolve. These three personas come  in the form of a reserved progressively adapted priest by the name of  Brendan Flynn Philip Seymour Hoffman a young brighteyed newcomer  nun named Sister James Amy Adams and a stern assertive and  conniving traditionalist nun named Aloysius Beauvier Meryl Streep.  While it would be of no fault of anyone to assume that the themes I  have mentioned thus far have everything and all to do with the question  of religious faith only this tangent however relevant and vital to the  backdrop of the story nevertheless serves as just thata backdrop.  Instead Doubt takes its intellectual conflict between heart and reason  in the form of a cloudy event involving father Flynn and a young  alterboy who takes a certain liking to the fatherlikefigure of the  priest. After hearing a notably unsure and reserved report from Sister  James Sister Beauvier asserts that she knows what is going on with  Flynn and that she's going to set everything straight.  But what then is her evidence? Not much. In fact aside from word of  mouth gossip you could decree from a young nave woman not sure  even of her own words Beauvier has nothing but her suspicion and  conviction to go on. From here on in then it is the sole intent of the  director to address the themes of doubt itself and its oppressor  being the Absolute Truth or so it is perceived by those who take heed  of its obvious presence.

Every detail of her acting is outstanding and believe me she did a job that glued your eyes to the screen.

	schema:reviewBody "John Patrick Shanley's film is of his own successful stage play. Rather like Arthur Miller's The Crucible we are presented with a thriller with an ecclesiastical backdrop where warped righteousness and power prevail in a moral fog. I have to say that on a first viewing Shanley's film sells itself thinly. In a wonderful script he creates a vast penumbra of terrors both ethical and social. Yet by the close none of these foibles or even the paranoia that they instigate has been really addressed. We do not know what has happened behind the scenes during the film which is fine but we need to have more about its fallout and assimilation. Sister Aloysius' final crumbling coda is insufficient.Shanley could not have had a better ensemble advocate for this film. Philip Seymour Hoffman's Flynn is the antithesis of Meryl Streep's Aloysius worldly sensitive and vulnerable. Perhaps needless to say that tear the screen up with the intensity of their escalating confrontation  their restraint only focuses their resolve and ire. Amy Adams holds her own in this company.However the deep dark heart of the film is in Aloysius' conference with Mrs Miller the mother of the boy around whom assumptions and accusations are spawned. This is a sequence of firstclass cinema in which arguably the finest two women actors in America grasp at the evanescent poles of propriety morality and social reality. Viola Davis was robbed of a Best Supporting Oscar for this performance without question.The film looks rather stagey as one might expect as Shanley has only got behind a camera once before. Nonetheless it looks fine Roger Deakins has photographed it well and Shanley wisely uses some light Hitchcockian touches diagonal framing to warm it up. Indeed I couldn't help thinking about I Confess Hitchcock's masterful entertaining adventure into the extremities of Catholic absolutism vs reality. This film is not that exciting  nor is it quite as forensic as The Crucible  but it is wellperformed and impressive. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I was not a fan of Doubt when it was on Broadway. I liked it but didn't love itcertainly not Pulitzer worthy. I found it too much of a problem play where people sit around and discuss ideas in ways that were meant to explore the ideas more then they were meant to be real. I found Sister Aloysius monstrous and almost comical. I did think it was nicely compact and did what it did and got off.It was with some trepidation that I sat down to watch John Patrick Shanley's film of his play. My reaction was less than I had hoped.The plot has Sister Aloysius Meryl Streep suspecting that all is not right with Father Flynn Philip Seymour Hoffman particularly with his relationship with one of the boys in the school. There is no evidence that anything really happened but the Sister is damn certain something did and she is going to make sure that Father Flynn is removed. As events occur that can be taken any number of ways the heat increases and a battle of wills transpires.In opening up his play Shanley has brought the story closer to the real world. There are more characters more events and many characters are deepened. Unfortunately in my eyes anyway the resulting opening up has made Sister Aloysius seem almost laughable. To be certain she is a monster of epic proportions and I know that there are and were many nuns and people who are very similar to her but what worked on stage as a symbol of the stone like past of the church and the world refusing to change comes off on screen in the real world as a caricature. I found her silly and I found I was giggling more than anything else especially with her ever shifting accent. Several critics in their reviews of the film said they found Streep to be in another movie from the rest of the cast and in some ways I did too. Its the construction of the character as I said she is the symbol of stagnation in a world of change and she is more archetype then real person. She is just a rigid construct and not a real person this would have worked on stage but not in a reality based film. And mark my words its going to be role that becomes spoofed for years to come to the point of becoming a clich The battle between stage and the screen is all over the film. What was a series of scenes on the stage where people effectively sat around and talked about what they have seen or might have seen now become a series of scenes where we actually see the events.For me the opening up of the play makes the story not one full of doubt rather one that seems confused. Events that on stage were only revealed as events others saw transpire are now seen by all to happen. The angst some characters feel at what they saw is now lessened because we see the events the locker for example. We also have to contend with a a vastly increased number of characters the original play had four so additionally the story is shaded by actually seeing all of these people. How can we feel the uncertainty of what the sisters saw or feel when we see the same events. On some level the very thing the film is about doubt is removed because we see things.I know its not fair to compare the film with the play since they are different but at the same time I couldn't stop doing so because there were things the film was doing that didn't work for me as opposed to the recent Frost Nixon which transcended it stage origins into something truly cinematic. Perhaps Ihad I not been exposed to the play I might have liked this better. As it stands now I found it a good but not great adaptation of a good but not great play.Around 7 out of 10 when Meryl Streep doesn't cause me to giggle".

It was one of the most riveting afternoons of theater I have ever experienced forceful and clean acting minimalist staging no sound effects other than the gasps of the audience. Cherry Jones played the hawkish Sister without any notion of Catholic school stereotypes. The plot twists provided all the thunder and lightning necessary to keep the attention of an audience left exhausted by the emotional battle between Aloysius and Flynn whom the Sister perceives as a threat within the faculty of the school where she is the principal.Shockingly Shanley has added all the clichs including thunder and lightning to his film of Doubt that he so effectively stripped from his play. In sabotaging his own play with stereotypes on screen Shanley has found a ready ally in his lead actress Ms. Streep who lacks only the green warpaint for her depiction of Aloysius as the Wicked Witch of the West. She does wear the shiny black gown and requisite spiked hat. It would take only long fingernails to turn her into Margaret Hamilton but those are reserved for costar Phillip Seymour Hoffman who makes Flynn about as threatening as the morning milkman. With the exception of Amy Adams and Viola Davis to round out the central foursome of the play the movie of Doubt bears no emotional resemblance to its vastly superior stage incarnation. By the time of the film's climax so devastating as portrayed by Cherry Jones on Broadway Streep has become such a cardboard cutout of the Catholic School nun that any suggestion of her personal redemption or regret is laughable. She even slaps the students with rulers as she purses her lips underneath that black cap.With maturation Streep appears to be entering the arena of latecareer overacting previously pioneered by Robert DeNiro Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman. Well it works for the Motion Picture Academy. She will certainly score a nomination and probably win an Oscar for her hammy work in this anemic adaptation of a great theatrical entertainment. For some of us Margaret Hamilton will remain the genuine witch to watch. And Doubt will linger in the memory as a great Broadway experience shamelessly reduced to camp on screen.".

	schema:headline " THE DREAM CITY THAT EDWARD YANG BUILT";
	schema:reviewBody "It is unlikely that Edward Yang would quarrel with those who described him as the Antonioni of the East.  But this kind of comparison is perhaps more damaging than helpful since it only engenders perceptions that have little or nothing to do with the filmmaker.  If we are to understand Yang at all we must allow his works to speak for themselvesthey must succeed or fail on their own terms.  The Terrorizer is one of Edward Yang's most accomplished works.  In style concerns and methodology it differs significantly from the masterworks of Antonioni.  Whereas Antonioni prefers to work with a narrower canvas choosing to develop his characters until they achieve selfawareness Yang seems to eschew such conventions offering instead a logic akin to the dream world.  The Terrorizer is indeed constructed very much like ChuangTzu's tale about a man who is unsure if he was dreaming that he was a butterfly or a butterfly who was dreaming that he was a man.It would be a disservice to think that the ending of The Terrorizer is anything like O. Henry.  It is perhaps  more accurate to describe the ending as a faux denouement.  The use of not a single but a double dream suggests that Yang is fully aware of his Chinese roots even when he is consciously quoting an outsider like Antonioni.  It also indicates that he is less interested in the psychology of social behavior than in the actions taken by individuals and the effects they have on one another throughout the social network regardless of their relations to each other.  It is to this end that several couples in an unnamed metropolis of Taiwan are examined a photographer and his girlfriend living off  the wealth of their family a teenage hustler and her pimp on a downward spiral of crime an unhappily married novelist who embarks on an affair with a past lover.  These three couples in turn are connected in some way tangibly or peripherally to a policeman a law enforcer who is powerless to hold the city together to keep it from coming apart.  It is little wonder that everyone is constantly forging new relationships or alliances in a city where obsolescence is the rule.Just as Antonioni uses dislocation as a means of conveying alienation Yang chooses to use absentationthe absence of thingsas a thematic device. Throughout the narrative one is reminded of the absence of fathersboth socially and politically.  It is the absence of leadership.  Elsewhere absentation is employed when the photographer decides to turn an apartment into one huge darkroom which denies him the reality of time while permitting him to create a world of his own.  At one point a teenage girl whom he temporarily harbors asked him if it is day or night.  When the camera finally peeps outside the apartment Yang gives us neither day nor night but that brief moment in time when light gives way to darkness or darkness breaks into light.  It is here that Yang best captures the logic of that dream world his protagonists are merely phantoms suspended in time.  It is the absence of time.  Throughout the narrative one is sometimes puzzled by the seemingly lack of explanations the initial breakup of the photographer and his girlfriend witnessed over the soundtrack of Smoke Gets in Your Eye the return of the photographer's stolen cameras the breakup of the married couple the status of the policeman with no emotional or physical ties.  It is the absence of elucidation.  Unlike the works of Antonioni where there is always a central character whose viewpoint mirrors our own functioning as a filter of reality Yang denies us of such privilege.  The impossibility of identifying with any character may be disorientating but it also serves as a metaphor of a city that has lost its moral compass. It is the absence of a central viewpoint.  Absentation is clearly an effective tool in exploring the void that lies at the heart of modern cultureit is the black hole of the human condition.When the film finally concludes it matters little what portion of it is real or a dream.  Or for that matter who the dreamer really is.  Fiction is perhaps no more than merely dreams perfectly realized and cinema the greatest dream machine ever built.".

This film shows Taipei as gritty dirty ugly poor and indifferent. The film was released in 1986 and it follows the police and ordinary citizens in situations which mirror everyday life including shootouts and chaos. The first scene is a police siren and soon you see a dead man lying on the street. Scenes here are interwoven amongst the characters who at first seem like they don't inhabit the same world. This makes the film kind of fascinating that you're a fly on the wall in these people's lives. The use of stark imagery shadows and light is very effective. The film despite its title is not about terrorism or the violence of a particular person. There are lies told in this film which cause some of the problems faced by the main characters. If you do not like moody introspective films I don't recommend this. However director Edward Yang whom we lost in 2007 has a very impressive body of work you have to see Yi Yi and this is an impressive film.".

	schema:headline " Yin and Yang balancing act in modern Taipei";
	schema:reviewBody "In the following I hope to write a review of Edward Yang's 'Terrorizer' that does justice to its presentation of the twin themes of interconnectedness and disconnectedness which move through the work like the forces of Yin and Yang.Superficially the movie deals with three couples in states of loose adherence. The characters and the unstable relationships between them are altered through tangential almost incidental interactions among themselves.Firstly there is a photographer evidently the son of a wealthy family and his girlfriend who he deserts for most of the film to follow his fascination with a rather unlikable Eurasian woman White Chick who he initially photographs fleeing from the police with a male accomplice. This fascination is the reason for the photographer's break with his girlfriend. He goes on to rent the apartment she was escaping from for use as a dark room. White Chick will later link up with a boyfriend to perpetrate a series of sexscams forming the second rather unstable 'couple' of the film joined by the common pursuit of easy money rather than romantic attachment. The third illstarred pair is a married couple a doctor Lili Chong and an authoress Chou Yufen. The doctor has been waiting for a promotion and appears frustrated in its delay. His wife a novelist feels that her world as a housewife is growing smaller and smaller. How can she possibly write under such circumstances she asks. A budding affair with her excolleague is further undermining the marriage. The following discusses major plot points in detail  Technology seems to play a major role in this dystopia. The cameras of the rich young man link him to White Chick prompting a break in his own romantic relationship. Later when White Chick returns to the apartment she had been fleeing and finds her image blown up to enormous size on the wall she faints waking to spend some time in the sealed world of the darkened room in conversation with the photographer. When he falls asleep she leaves and steals his cameras hoping to sell them returning them perhaps because she has found them too hard to sell quickly. Again the cameras circumstantially related to a dissolving relationship.A prank phone call by the female criminal sets off Chou Yufen's suspicions of her husband's fidelity. Their relationship was already on the rocks but this simple call pushes it to breaking point. Technology has intruded albeit arbitrarily to 'break the camel's back' as it were not actively causing a rupture in relations but facilitating it. the brief connection of two people through a phone line precipitates a separation.The last piece of technology a pistol is active in the last sequences of the movie a rather dreamy set of scenarios which may reflect the desires and despair of the abandoned doctor or be actual dreams of his wife at the time in bed with her lover. My initial view of the three scenarios presented was that the first two were imagined by the doctor 1 Should he just kill his wife's lover unannounced? This idea is rejected because it contains no direct confrontation with the lover or his unfaithful wife. 2 The next scenario involves just such a confrontation though he cannot bring himself to shoot his wife. Instead he goes after the woman who made the prank phone call. The police intrude upon this trajectory as he comes facetoface with White Chick since the handgun belongs to LiLi Chong's detective friend with whom he is indeed staying after a night of heavy drinking. After he envisages how this course of action will unfold he opts to shoot himself instead 3which I think actually occurs. Unless according to another theory these are all dreamed by the wife who does indeed wake with a start when the final shot is heard. End of discussion of plot points  This complicated tangle of trajectories is portrayed in the typically cool disconnected Taiwanese style with naturalistic sound only and no music except that which is played on radios etc. The manner in which the stories are presented and connected parallels their content for there is no consistent pointofview presented that could link us to any one character and the editing tosses us from one situation to another leaving it to the viewer to make the connections between the scenes and in turn the characters themselves. I suspect that this manner of presentation was itself designed to convey certain realities of life in Taipei a rough mixture of fortuitous coincidence and disconnectedness a situation which the appliances designed to make life easier only serve to compound further.This is a film that I found enjoyable to 'assemble' and which rewarded concentrated viewing even while avoiding answering many of the questions it raised. I suspect that further viewings may only raise other questions rather than bring me closer to answers. 'Terrorizers' is very much an art film and very much a Taiwanese film. I would recommended it most to those who already profess an interest in this combination such as lovers of Taiwanese New Wave films generally. Those who like Antonioni's 'Blow Up' may also find some points of interest as well as several interesting parallels. In sum a mature work from an original and talented 'auteur'.".

White Chick will later link up with a boyfriend to perpetrate a series of sexscams forming the second rather unstable 'couple' of the film joined by the common pursuit of easy money rather than romantic attachment. The third illstarred pair is a married couple a doctor Lili Chong and an authoress Chou Yufen. The doctor has been waiting for a promotion and appears frustrated in its delay. His wife a novelist feels that her world as a housewife is growing smaller and smaller. How can she possibly write under such circumstances she asks. A budding affair with her excolleague is further undermining the marriage. The following discusses major plot points in detail  Technology seems to play a major role in this dystopia. The cameras of the rich young man link him to White Chick prompting a break in his own romantic relationship. Later when White Chick returns to the apartment she had been fleeing and finds her image blown up to enormous size on the wall she faints waking to spend some time in the sealed world of the darkened room in conversation with the photographer. When he falls asleep she leaves and steals his cameras hoping to sell them returning them perhaps because she has found them too hard to sell quickly. Again the cameras circumstantially related to a dissolving relationship.A prank phone call by the female criminal sets off Chou Yufen's suspicions of her husband's fidelity. Their relationship was already on the rocks but this simple call pushes it to breaking point. Technology has intruded albeit arbitrarily to 'break the camel's back' as it were not actively causing a rupture in relations but facilitating it. the brief connection of two people through a phone line precipitates a separation.The last piece of technology a pistol is active in the last sequences of the movie a rather dreamy set of scenarios which may reflect the desires and despair of the abandoned doctor or be actual dreams of his wife at the time in bed with her lover. My initial view of the three scenarios presented was that the first two were imagined by the doctor 1 Should he just kill his wife's lover unannounced? This idea is rejected because it contains no direct confrontation with the lover or his unfaithful wife. 2 The next scenario involves just such a confrontation though he cannot bring himself to shoot his wife. Instead he goes after the woman who made the prank phone call. The police intrude upon this trajectory as he comes facetoface with White Chick since the handgun belongs to LiLi Chong's detective friend with whom he is indeed staying after a night of heavy drinking. After he envisages how this course of action will unfold he opts to shoot himself instead 3which I think actually occurs. Unless according to another theory these are all dreamed by the wife who does indeed wake with a start when the final shot is heard. End of discussion of plot points  This complicated tangle of trajectories is portrayed in the typically cool disconnected Taiwanese style with naturalistic sound only and no music except that which is played on radios etc. The manner in which the stories are presented and connected parallels their content for there is no consistent pointofview presented that could link us to any one character and the editing tosses us from one situation to another leaving it to the viewer to make the connections between the scenes and in turn the characters themselves. I suspect that this manner of presentation was itself designed to convey certain realities of life in Taipei a rough mixture of fortuitous coincidence and disconnectedness a situation which the appliances designed to make life easier only serve to compound further.This is a film that I found enjoyable to 'assemble' and which rewarded concentrated viewing even while avoiding answering many of the questions it raised. I suspect that further viewings may only raise other questions rather than bring me closer to answers. 'Terrorizers' is very much an art film and very much a Taiwanese film. I would recommended it most to those who already profess an interest in this combination such as lovers of Taiwanese New Wave films generally. Those who like Antonioni's 'Blow Up' may also find some points of interest as well as several interesting parallels. In sum a mature work from an original and talented 'auteur'.";

	schema:reviewBody "The opening film of this retrospective a few days ago The Terrorizers was presented in a gorgeous restored digital transfer that is beautiful to gawk at every frame and in essence what would have probably been seen during its first ever debut back in 1986. It's not cheap nor easy to have a film remastered and restored to get rid of pops cackles and dirt or to readjust its colour grading as seen during the promotional clip on its restoration before the film proper and it's really an excellent job done given the tremendous amount of effort behind the scene.Edward Yang's third feature film cowritten with Hsiao Yeh may have given the audience an ultimate red herring with an action oriented introduction complete with cops and robbers and a shootout only for that to serve as just about the only real action sequence in this film that's steeped in what would be a relatively violent outcome by the time the end credits rolled. The Terrorizers tells a myriad of interweaving story lines involving a myriad of characters such as Wang An's delinquent Eurasian girl who runs a call girl scam where she robs her clientele in hotel rooms and a photographer's obsession with her when he snaps her escape from the cops.But the storyline that just begged for attention is something similar like his first two films that dealt with the breakdown in relationships against the backdrop of modernity and how modern life and its expectations chip at passion and romance where couples rarely emerge unscathed from failure to communicate their true intentions. I suppose it is akin to the filmmaker's way of constant warning given a trilogy now focused on this aspect that to have emotions kept within oneself would only pave way for a massive blowout when the last straw is reached and this offers no chance whatsoever for reconciliation only destruction and the humiliation that comes along with it.We see it all coming from the first time the couple of Yue Fen Cora Miao and her husband Li Zhong Lee Li Chun got introduced where the former's writer's block complaint becomes an avenue to be chided by her husband who deemed her issue rather unimportant given that it is a work of fiction and not life and death. Clearly this lack of sensitivity was the seed sowed before a random cataclysmic event evolves this into her wanting to leave the matrimonial home for a place where she can get some escape and seek out inspiration which turned out to be nothing more than seeking out an exlover to carry out an affair with.While you may want to sympathize with the husband wait. Edward Yang and Hsiao Yeh for some reasons crafted a number of characters here who are mostly lacking in morals. Li Zhong eyeing a promotion which he thinks is a given with the death of his boss goes to the extent of framing a fellow coworker so that he can eliminate the competition for that move upwards which makes him quite the bastard who gets his karmic just desserts through the infidelity of his wife which ultimately humiliates the man who has to wear a green hat and is without a defining career which he so highly prizes it as sort of a beacon in social stature.One can imagine just who the real terrorizers are in the film  it's easy to point the fingers at criminals as depicted in the beginning of the film or whoever is holding that gun to exact some form of revenge against pride but clearly in this instance it's really the female of the species who continue to torment emotionally especially when the silent treatment gets exacted which I feel is possibly the cruelest form of torture to a loved one. The ending is much talked about and in my opinion seemed to stem either as material from the fictional book that Yue Fen finally churned out or an alternative reality which points to a consistently bleak outcome of that modern day grind in life.".

The truth is the movie is infantile in construction longwinded and painfully disjointed.I suppose that if you are of Alfred Hitchcock's school of thought Don't tell them show them then you could try to appreciate this movie but you would still be hard pressed.First of all The Terrorizers tries streamofconsciousness in the style of JeanLuc Godard and fails in this. Edward Yang seems to understand the basics of the technique but he's very unskilled at it. Perhaps he gets better with age I don't know as I haven't yet attempted other Yang films. The point is he uses a dearth of show don't tell that really only serves to interrupt the procession of the story. Sure he gets in some visually arresting images but they don't draw the story together and they don't help to make it any better.Additionally the major concept behind streamofconsciousness and show don't tell is that with the right images the right drama repetition and tight correlation the viewer will be able to make his or her own inferences not to say that these will be the correct inferences but those can be amended as the story progresses and every director should strive for some of this type of audience interaction. In this Edward Yang sorely disappoints. The viewer is constantly on the periphery. There is no reason to be drawn in no reason to consider the characters or their motives no reason to get emotionally involved and really no reason to stay alert.Finally Yang gets lost in the story that he wants to tell not the story that the movie itself is telling. His art moves in one direction but like a large dog he can't control he's constantly yanking the lead trying to get it back onto the course he wants not the one that it is naturally following. The most egregious example of this is the ending. The ending really should have occurred at the moment of the husband's revelation. The ending of the book that the movie is focusing on and by extension a possible ending for the movie has already been told to us. If Yang had chosen to end at that point he would have had a much more powerful piece leaving the watcher in suspense  does the story play out as the book says or does Yang's real world play out differently? Asking the viewer to think about this is the sort of viewer interaction that Yang painfully needs. Instead he continues to tell the story he wants to tell straining the natural conclusion for the sake of what? For the sheer sake of lingering on a main character  we didn't' need to know more about her superficially and Yang wouldn't feel the need to tell us if he hadn't made her into a veneer instead of bothering to make her a more engaging and deep character to begin with. Why else does Yang prolong and torture his movie? To get in some more of those visually arresting images. The movie truly suffers for it. It wants to end it has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer unsettled but instead Yang pushes on. Instead Yang constructs a complex ending that leads the viewer on causing him or her to constantly ask so what? The first ending the one that Yang ignored that was good. The second ending well my thought wasso what who cares? because it's not as if it is introducing something that hasn't been put forth in the storyline already... but the last ending? That really was a waste of time. Not only did the real ending leave me disengaged but I also felt it was an affront to what the story could have been. Yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the bubblegummelancholynoirtinged conclusion that he had insisted upon all along.My last problem with the movie has nothing to do with the movie itself but rather its postproduction. The subbing if you see it subbed is horrible. Long sentences stay up for a second or two while short ones stay up far too long. Also as Yang quickly changes images the subtitles are removed from the screen. This is one of those rare instances that subtitles should be able to stay on the screen even as the image has changed because there's not much dialog going on anyway.".

	schema:headline " BadAss best Van Damme Science FictionActionPacked Film!";
	schema:reviewBody "Universal Soldier 1992 Is one of the best Van Damme action scifi classic movies from the 90's also my favorite childhood movie that I am still watching it today. It is my third best favorite Van Damme movie! It has Dolph Lundgren in it and I love this movie to Death!!! JeanClaude Van Damme and Dolph Lundrgren are awesome in this film. Action and fighting sequences were awesome till today Roland Emmerich did made a great job as the director of this action scifi film flick. Every time I see this action flick I am not bored with it and is definitely Van Damme's best action movie. I enjoy the action I mainly love this movie because it focus on Vietnam War and it has experiments that US military actually really secretly did that. The fights scenes between Van Damme and Lundgren were awesome! This is the only movie that I care and love about! All the sequels to me sucked ass! None of them can hold a candle to this movie! JeanClaude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren reunited 20. years later after working together in here in the film The Expendables 2 2012 my favorite action packed movie. This movie is a bad ass and kicks ass! I love it so much I even prefer above Kikcboxer and Double Impact. This is the movie that I love. I love all the actors in this movie Ally Walker was a great cast as reporter Veronica Roberts. Chandra West who played her in TV movies couldn't even hold a candle to Ally Walker.Ally Walker was also cast as Dr. Samantha 'Sam' Waters in my favorite TV Show Profiler. ARE WE HAVING FUN YET? Hell yes.The best science fiction action film ever made. It still holds up great to this day. Whenever I watch this movie I am having fun. A really fun inventive action flick with some really kick ass fight scenes and a sense of fun about it that makes it irresistible. Van Damme and Lundgren were great in this and it really is a shame that despite this being a hit Lundgren still did not get out of direct to video land and continued to get overlooked by Hollywood after the film's release. This movie it is the film that made Van Damme in to a star and saved his career. It is so aggravating how far they rushed with the sequels. At least we still got the one amazing movie that made Dolph one of the greatest villains ever well maybe not a villain a but a real bad ass! I like the aspect of the cool down process and the story is easy to understand. Also Dolph Lundgren's scene in the grocery store is one of my all time favorite scenes in any movie. I really love this movie to death. Alongside Hard Target and Bloodsport Universal Soldier is my third favorite Van Damme movie. I don't care what anyone say's or thinks about this movie I will not listen to them I will listen to my self! When I was 13. years old I was in the hospital talking with my new friends about this movie that I have made them there when I was lying on the bed. That time I never watched or heard about this movie before and they told me how great it is. They where right it took me few months till I finally watch this movie on TV and I absolutely loved it. This film for me has a great memories on my childhood. This is the basic plot about the film it has death soldiers that turns in to a cyborg killing machines that are anti terrorist and their experiments goes awry wrong and they start killing innocent people and only one man a machine can stop them. The final battle scene between Van Damme and Lundgren is epic! Van Damme uses his awesome spin kicks with his legs that we already saw in Bloodsport Kickboxer and Double Impact. The meat grinder scene is when Scott is crushed and killed that was really a bad ass scene! I am giving this movie my perfect 10 because it deserves it and Roland Emmerich did a great job directing this movie. I can watch this movie over and over again. JeanClaude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren did a both a perfect solid job playing their characters. I love them!".

	schema:headline " Excellent Action Fluff";
	schema:reviewBody "Universal Soldier might be dumb and derivative but I couldn't care less it is also one of the most entertaining action films to be released in the 1990s and provided signature roles for two of my favourite trash icons JeanClaude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. The film also serves as a testament to the last good movie made by Roland Emmerich before selling his soul to the Hollywood machine.This film has long been a favourite with genre fans. Universal Soldier was a theatrical box office hit but really developed its cult following on video. I watch this film every couple of years and I'm always struck by the quality of the writing directing and yes even the acting. This is simply a well crafted movie and an excellent example of a film that is so much more than the sum of its admittedly tawdry parts.Universal Soldier owes a hell of a lot to The Terminator. It lifts a whole raft of ideas from Cameron's action classic including the basic concept of a good guy with superhuman strength protecting a woman from a bad guy with superhuman strength. Actually it even borrows minor details like the eyecam the nude walk and an act of selfmutilation. Nevertheless the film never feels like a blatant rip off. Roland Emmerich while never a particularly original mind injects sufficient change and innovation into the film to ensure it has a distinct energy of its own.The film recycles old ideas with great skill due to the excellent screenplay. The action comes thick and fast and the dialogue is first rate for an action film. Furthermore it provides several memorable characters and successfully introduces an element of black humour without detracting from the action. No matter how well written it is an action film is only as good its action sequences and Mr Emmerich does not disappoint. The film contains several fantastic set pieces from the grandeur of the hostage rescue to the phenomenal truck chase through the desert which even manages to find time for a midchase game of catch with live grenades and a string of memorably corny oneliners. Emmerich is in his element filming explosions and stunts from every imaginable angle. Universal Soldier is also far gorier than his later films and is all the better for it.The film would not be half as enjoyable without its leading men. JeanClaude and Dolph both give great performances. And no I'm not being sarcastic. JeanClaude was at his physical peak and excels during the action scenes. He performs several signature flying kicks in a great fight with Dolph which is mercifully filmed in a long shot  I wish the John Woo wannabes from the cut and paste school of directing who directed JeanClaude's later films had taken note. Dolph is great fun as the villain making crazy eyes for all he is worth and relishing every trashy oneliner. They both are more than adequate in their nonaction scenes which probably has a lot to do with the fact that they are essentially playing refined zombies who walk around naked a lot. The supporting cast is also great. Ally Walker showed a lot of promise as the female lead and has gone on to have a good career in television. Jerry Orbach and Tico Wells also TV regulars give memorable performances in minor roles.Universal Soldier is relentless the film starts with a bang and never lets up. It might be trashy but it is never less than completely entertaining. In my opinion this is one of the seminal action films of the 90s. The sequels however are only recommended for experienced crap connoisseurs.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember first watching 'Universal Soldier' on TV when I was about 8 or 9 years old. After that whenever I saw it it didn't have sound or I was rather inebriated or both or had other circumstances prevent me from appreciating the awesomeness of Van Damme v. Lundgren until it was on TV again recently and I got to revel in the glory of 'Universal Soldier'.Van Damme plays Luc Deveraux a soldier serving in Vietnam under the command of Sergeant Andrew Scott Dolph Lundgren. Deveraux has an attack of conscience when Scott seems to lose his altogether. In fact Scott seems to be somewhere between insane and plain evil. After Deveraux refuses  on Scott's orders  to kill innocent villagers the two soldiers kill each other. Listed as MissinginAction the bodies of the two soldiers are used in the Universal Soldier program and the two are reactivated some time later as GR44 Van Damme and GR13 Lundgren supposedly with no memories of their past.When reporter Veronica Roberts Ally Walker stumbles onto some things she shouldn't have seen seriously if you want to keep your project secret you don't drive around in an armoured bus leaving unlocked crates lying around outside her cameraman is murdered by one of the UniSols. GR44 has flashes of his past and takes Veronica on the run with the slightly very? unstable GR13 in hotpursuit.Action abounds for the rest of the movie and while there isn't anything truly special it is way cool or even Awesome. We have car chases heavy vehicle chases Van Damme beating people up and Lundgren being one of the awesomest bad guys ever. What is there to complain about? Nothing that's what. I must say that Dolph Lundgren is at his best playing villains and I'd even argue that his role in 'Universal Soldier' has been some of his best work to date. Van Damme also gets to credit 'Univeral Soldier' as being one his best movies.Plotwise? Again little  if no  originality and a pretty thin plot. However as I always say Less plot  More action  Awesome and everyone is happy and if you don't agree then you really should not be watching 'Universal Soldier'.I love 'Universal Soldier'. It stands close to the pinnacle of action Bmovies a genre everybody loves! It is a shame that I can the official and unofficial sequels on DVD but I can't get the original in all its awesome glory on DVD here in Australia. 'Universal Soldier' is a mustsee for action fans everywhere  810".

	schema:reviewBody "Muscles from Brussels and the Swedish manofwar Dolph Lundgren team up as superhuman soldiers brought back to life from Vietnam in this movie. I'm not sure what it is exactly that they do  I wasn't paying attention. But I'm pretty sure it's something about struggling with obeying the orders from their commanders and having flashbacks from their past lives. What I know is that they do fight a lot. They also fight civilians. They even fight each other and that's when things start to get very entertaining.It is only fair to watch this movie at least once since it has brought us not one not two but THREE sequels. What's even more awesome about these sequels is that they are all rated under 3.5 but not by enough votes to get them on the bottom 100 list on IMDb. If you fail in getting on a list like that you even fail at failing and that is admirable. Universal Soldier is much more wellliked and higherrated and rightly so.I do not recall who but another film critic put it best when he pointed to how different Universal Soldiers was from your average sciencefiction movie. To summarize this where most scifi movies get to the part where all the complex science needs to be explained by some brilliant professor Universal Soldiers simply offers the explanation we hypercharged their bodies to turn dead flesh into living tissue. And that's how dead soldiers were reanimated into superhuman killing machines. Brilliant. There's no pretension  just take it or leave it.I can't find it in my heart to give this movie anything less than a 7 based on what it set out to do. Even though the acting is atrocious the script is a joke and the dialogue is stupid it's still a classic in my opinion. It had some intentionally funny moments like when Van Damme was in the diner and ate like ten meals of today's special and everyone was staring at him. If you don't find stuff like that funny you have to watch it strictly tongueincheek and just go for the brainless early90s style action and cutrate explosions. 710".

Van Damme is above his usual standard with a fairly subtle performancelet no one call it wooden. Ally Walker has charm and is watchable but it is Lundgren who steals the show with a delightfully villainous performance.

	schema:reviewBody "In a war zone Luc Deveraux stops his officer Andrew Scott killing innocent civilians.  However both die in the struggle.  Years later they are part of a reanimation programme all Universal Soldiers  perfect fighting machines controlled like robots.  However Deveraux has memory flashbacks causing him to flee with a reporter his commander also experiences memory residues and takes the remaining soldiers to go after Deveraux.One of Van Damme's and Lundgren's best films  although that's not saying much.  The plot is pretty basic although there is some reasonable moralising about the soldiers.  The action isn't fancy but it's solid and unlike it's sequel it's not afraid to be violent.  While it's not a classic it does allow some good scenes and is a bit better than the usual Van Damme fare.The cast are mixed.  Van Damme is a perfect cardboard robot but doesn't convince when he has become human.  He is the brunt of some good jokes too what accent?' and gets to bare his ass in customary style.

	onyx:emotionText "In a war zone Luc Deveraux stops his officer Andrew Scott killing innocent civilians.  However both die in the struggle.  Years later they are part of a reanimation programme all Universal Soldiers  perfect fighting machines controlled like robots.  However Deveraux has memory flashbacks causing him to flee with a reporter his commander also experiences memory residues and takes the remaining soldiers to go after Deveraux.One of Van Damme's and Lundgren's best films  although that's not saying much.  The plot is pretty basic although there is some reasonable moralising about the soldiers.  The action isn't fancy but it's solid and unlike it's sequel it's not afraid to be violent.  While it's not a classic it does allow some good scenes and is a bit better than the usual Van Damme fare.The cast are mixed.  Van Damme is a perfect cardboard robot but doesn't convince when he has become human.  He is the brunt of some good jokes too what accent?' and gets to bare his ass in customary style.  Lundgren is actually quite good and his character develops from robot into warweary soldier quite well.  Ally Walker is soso but she doesn't convince.Overall this is enjoyable but it isn't perfect.  For action fans it's solid enough to satisfy.";

	schema:reviewBody "Universal Soldier is an intense non stop action film that has you hooked from the start. Roland Emmerich as always delivers a finely polished entertainment piece that pits two big action stars against each other in the best roles of their career. With Terminator 2 Executive Producer Mario Kassar being part of this film quality was ensured although not to the standard of T2.The gadgets and action sequences are what this film is all about and do well to distract from the far from original plot. With explosions and gunfights galore this is an action seeker's dream as there is an exciting scene every few minutes. The UniSol Truck is a clever idea that makes for some great enjoyment later on in the film and also provides plenty of intense moments throughout. A truck that resembles a small military base is ridiculous but realism is not Universal Soldier's forte.JeanClaude Van Damme is not a good actor and only this film and Hard Target are the only Van Damme films I've seen that are worth watching. In this film he is uncharacteristically good. Like Arnie in The Terminator Van Damme benefits from playing a sub human character allowing him to get away with delivering his lines flat. Fight scenes are Van Damme's strong point and in this film he is in great shape to dish out some butt whoppin' high kicks. Dolph Lundgren gives a standout performance and is one of the most enjoyable bad guys you can watch. His lines are fantastic and he shines with charisma all the way to the end of the film. Lundgren's screen presence is so domineering he cuts a great image of someone you don't want to mess with. Whilst not the most demanding role for an actor Sgt. Andrew Scott is a very memorable character and Dolph Lundgren does more than enough to bring him to life. It is great to see Van Damme against Lundgren as they are very different in stature and persona and also have different fighting styles which creates great contrast.Universal Soldier is not a film that will push any boundaries or be spoken about for years to come but it is one of the most entertaining and well made films of this genre you'll ever witness. Watch out for Lundgren's psychotic powerhouse performance which will have you in stitches and in amazement.".

Stallone Schwarzenegger Seagal and yes to some extent Van Damme. The Muscles from Brussels was always my least favourite but I usually checked out his films. I don't think any of them are REALLY good but I've always liked this one very much. Sure it's pretty dumb for the most part but it has a distinct advantage over most of his films IT'S ALSO GOT DOLPH LUNDGREN. Now I just remember him so vividly in Rocky 4 and being as young as I was when I first saw it I remember cheering him on and being immensely sad when he lost.Universal Soldier has a good opener introducing Van Damme and Lundgren as Vietnam soldiers Lundgren a total nut and Van Damme a good soldier who wind up killing each other. Decades later they end up becoming part of a zombie ultra military squad who are controlled by the government. But they snap out of it come to life and go head to head once more since they have some unfinished business.Now the story is no Oscar winner but it's fairly original and sets the motion for some great action sequences and a very entertaining good vs. evil battle between Lundgren and Van Damme. If only the Ally Walker character could have been made a bit more tolerable and less a clich we'd nearly have a total winner.All in all the action scenes are great Lundgren is terrific obviously having a field day playing his role and Van Damme is alright but then again he's never been great.Universal Soldier is Van Damme's best film and quite easily recommended for action fans.".

	schema:headline " Super Soldiers of the future  set in far off 1993!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Universal Soldier starts out in 1968 with Van Damme playing the good guy standing up for some innocent Vietnamese people in a village during the war. Dolph Lundgren plays an embittered American soldier consumed with anger about his fellow soldiers who have been killed in the war and intent on taking it out on any Vietnamese people he can find. Luc Van Damme insists that the village has been cleared and those people have done nothing wrong and the ensuing conflict leads to both of them killing each other before the opening credits are even over. The dead soldiers are declared M.I.A. not because their having killed each other would be a little difficult to explain but because they are needed for a new kind of military technology.Now here's where I get a little lost. We cut to the Present Day Nevada Desert 25 years later. You'll notice that 25 years after 1968 you'll find 1993 the year after this movie was released. I supposed the original audiences were left in complete terror about what was going to take place around the following Spring. The rest of us may wonder why the movie markets itself as being a story about futuristic military technology when it takes place about 56 months after the release date.At any rate we are immediately taken to a tense hostage situation that is taking place if I'm not mistaken on the Hoover Dam so that the new cyborgsoldiers could be put to the test a full quarter of a century after they were made. Truly they are impressive pieces of machinery or whatever they are and the situation is soon under control. The local news outlets gleefully report that the situation has been taken care of and with no casualties or injuries. Maybe they forgot about the dozen or so innocent people that had been machine gunned right there in the middle of the road in broad daylight. Or maybe they just don't count.The movie plays around a lot with what Luc and Andrew Scott Lundgren have become. There's a scene where after Luc begins having flashbacks of Vietnam and escapes with an attractive reporter who was fired for being late to the scene he walks outside naked as the day he was born explaining that he's hot. You see one of the symptoms of the new soldiers is that their body temperature runs hot so they have to sleep in refrigerated compartments to avoid overheating. Soon after that they are discovered so Luc now named GR44 asks Veronica the reporter to examine his naked chiseled body and look for where they have hidden the tracking device. Look for something unusual he tells her. Something hard. Clearly the ideas lifted by the boatload from the Terminator movies need not be named. I have only room for 1000 words here and to list the borrowed ideas would take more than that. But even though there are literally scenes lifted directly from the Terminators like the caf scene where GR44 casually beats the crap out of everyone in sight the movie never feels like a ripoff. Maybe that's because for all the bad rap he gets Van Damme has a definite undeniable on screen charm. At one point not long after they've met Veronica asks him where he's from. I figured you gotta be French or something she says because of your accent. What accent? he asks. He seems genuinely confused. The movie sort of descends into routine action clichs by the time GR's 13 Lundgren and 44 start having flashbacks and start to remember that they killed each other and hence have unfinished business. It seems that they revert to the emotion that they had at the time they died so GR13 wants vengeance of anyone within shooting distance while GR44 just wants to go home. Thus we get the governmentmade supersoldiers trying to kill each other. This leads to a half amusing and half disturbing scene where GR13 terrorizes some astonished civilians in a supermarket while another GR mindlessly gnaws on a raw steak and then ultimately to the obligatory final showdown.I found the explanation for the transformation particularly interesting. I feel like in science fiction movies how the 'fiction' is explained is where most of the creativity lies. Sadly there's not much here. A scientist explains to Veronica how it all worked. By hyperaccelerating the bodies we discovered that we could turn dead flesh into living tissue. Hyperaccelerating? Is that how they got the soldiers to age superslow? Or not at all and for 25 years? Sadly we may never know. When Veronica replies What are you saying doctor? there is a knock at the door so he doesn't really have time to explain. Too bad.There's not much to be said about the ending. It's the worst part of the movie by far. An enormous copout the likes of which is rarely seen even in bad bmovies. But I should also mention that the movie is not as bad as the ending or even as bad as many people say. It's not a science fiction classic but it's a fun action popcorn movie like many of Van Damme's films. If nothing else the movie teaches us a valuable lesson  don't throw a beer can at a man wearing a necklace made out of human ears.Note At the Cannes Film Festival when Universal Soldier was released Van Damme and Lundgren got into an argument and then a shoving match right there on the red carpet in front of the world's cameras you can check it out on YouTube. Many lament that we may never know if it was real or just a publicity stunt. It definitely looked real to me but if it wasn't then all the mystery around it must mean that they really CAN act!".

Many lament that we may never know if it was real or just a publicity stunt. It definitely looked real to me but if it wasn't then all the mystery around it must mean that they really CAN act!";

	schema:headline " Interesting story with a dragging plot";
	schema:reviewBody "Before films like Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 2010 were released most action stars performed solo. Arnold Schwarzenegger Sylvester Stallone Bruce Willis Dolph Lundgren and JeanClaude Van Damme all made their own separate movies. Combining star power wasn't usually thought of because of how different the fan bases were. However this movie is one those exceptions. Today it could be considered a movie where they collaborated before they were extremely well known although at the time they were anyway. It was rare at that time to see two big names on the same screen  which probably pumped up a lot of people.Here JeanClaude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren play Luc Deveraux and Andrew Scott two Vietnam veteran soldiers killed in the line of duty who end up being regenerated to serve as a UniSol short for Universal Soldier. As a UniSol their purpose is to carry out impossible tasks that no other ordinary soldier could do. To carry out these missions the UniSols are monitored and commanded by remote audio instructions. One day on the latest mission Luc begins to have a relapse of old memories and begins to bug out. After disobeying an order he runs off with reporter Veronica Roberts Ally Walker to find out what he missed. Close behind them is Luc's colonel with Andrew Scott 2nd in command looking to rid them of their existence.For the majority of the running time the plot is a big chase. Yet in only some instances does it actually feel like a chase. Writer Dean Devlin managed to include some unique scenes but his pacing on how the story moves plods from time to time. That's not to say the material he includes in the story isn't noteworthy. Again this goes back to some unique scenes that Devlin included  most of which involve Andrew Scott Lundgren. This movie is also one of the few that director Roland Emmerich did not include a political commentary on since this idea is so far fetched. However he does mingle some themes that are still important to recognize  for example playing the role of God. If there was the technology to actually reanimate dead tissue would it be possible to have complete control over the body? Hard to say the mind is a tricky thing.However the movie cannot be analyzed too much because throughout the story there are a lot of loopholes and questions that aren't answered  like how can someone survive a fall from an enormous height and not come back mangled or even bruised? This is one those films where it's fun to watch but cannot be taken literal because of how absurd the idea really is. The acting can be moderately dealt with. Ally Walker plays her role like any other person would. She has a few lines that'll make people chuckle but not much else. JeanClaude Van Damme's acting is stone faced for most of the time because of how he's not familiar with the world. However Dolph Lundgren looked like he had a great time playing his role because of how deranged his character is. It was also wise of the casting department to at least make Lundgren the antagonist because of his height. If it were the other way around I'm not sure if the entertainment level would be as high.What is fun to watch here is when Lundgren and Van Damme finally clash. Since they both have martial arts training there's no question that the kicks and fists will fly between them. Lundgren's got the bulk and Van Damme's got the agility. They both are good in contrast to each other the only thing that was needed was Van Damme putting just a little more emotion into his role. Other than that the cinematography and editing works well too. Finally composing the musical score belongs to Christopher Franke who now produces music for The Amazing Race 2002 series. Franke's score does contain tunes that can be heard with light emotional tones but it's nothing too deep which is pretty much how the film should be taken. Fun but not deep.The action on screen between Dolph Lundgren and JeanClaude Van Damme is fun even though it is sporadic. The story elements are interesting considering it also makes the plot drag. Look for nothing too deep here.".

Combining star power wasn't usually thought of because of how different the fan bases were. However this movie is one those exceptions. Today it could be considered a movie where they collaborated before they were extremely well known although at the time they were anyway. It was rare at that time to see two big names on the same screen  which probably pumped up a lot of people.Here JeanClaude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren play Luc Deveraux and Andrew Scott two Vietnam veteran soldiers killed in the line of duty who end up being regenerated to serve as a UniSol short for Universal Soldier. As a UniSol their purpose is to carry out impossible tasks that no other ordinary soldier could do. To carry out these missions the UniSols are monitored and commanded by remote audio instructions. One day on the latest mission Luc begins to have a relapse of old memories and begins to bug out. After disobeying an order he runs off with reporter Veronica Roberts Ally Walker to find out what he missed. Close behind them is Luc's colonel with Andrew Scott 2nd in command looking to rid them of their existence.For the majority of the running time the plot is a big chase. Yet in only some instances does it actually feel like a chase. Writer Dean Devlin managed to include some unique scenes but his pacing on how the story moves plods from time to time. That's not to say the material he includes in the story isn't noteworthy. Again this goes back to some unique scenes that Devlin included  most of which involve Andrew Scott Lundgren. This movie is also one of the few that director Roland Emmerich did not include a political commentary on since this idea is so far fetched. However he does mingle some themes that are still important to recognize  for example playing the role of God. If there was the technology to actually reanimate dead tissue would it be possible to have complete control over the body? Hard to say the mind is a tricky thing.However the movie cannot be analyzed too much because throughout the story there are a lot of loopholes and questions that aren't answered  like how can someone survive a fall from an enormous height and not come back mangled or even bruised? This is one those films where it's fun to watch but cannot be taken literal because of how absurd the idea really is. The acting can be moderately dealt with. Ally Walker plays her role like any other person would. She has a few lines that'll make people chuckle but not much else. JeanClaude Van Damme's acting is stone faced for most of the time because of how he's not familiar with the world. However Dolph Lundgren looked like he had a great time playing his role because of how deranged his character is. It was also wise of the casting department to at least make Lundgren the antagonist because of his height. If it were the other way around I'm not sure if the entertainment level would be as high.What is fun to watch here is when Lundgren and Van Damme finally clash. Since they both have martial arts training there's no question that the kicks and fists will fly between them. Lundgren's got the bulk and Van Damme's got the agility. They both are good in contrast to each other the only thing that was needed was Van Damme putting just a little more emotion into his role. Other than that the cinematography and editing works well too. Finally composing the musical score belongs to Christopher Franke who now produces music for The Amazing Race 2002 series. Franke's score does contain tunes that can be heard with light emotional tones but it's nothing too deep which is pretty much how the film should be taken. Fun but not deep.The action on screen between Dolph Lundgren and JeanClaude Van Damme is fun even though it is sporadic. The story elements are interesting considering it also makes the plot drag. Look for nothing too deep here.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jean Claude Van Damme like many other martial artiststurnedactors simply cannot do much real acting. Like Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal his acting is wooden and Van Damme also has an accent thick enough to cut with a knife. However sometimes even a poor actor can find a role to suit him much like Arnold Schwarznegger as a cyborg in The Terminator. That seems to be what happened here Van Damme found a role that worked well within his limitations a role in which he unexpectedly shone.The movie is typical scifiaction fodder Dead men are revived as virtually unstoppable soldiers. The viewer meets the two main characters in the opening sequence as soldiers fighting in Viet Nam. Van Damme's Luc Devereaux is a decent man doing his best to survive the brutal conditions of war with his soul intact. Dolph Lundgren's Andrew Scott is a psychotic reveling in the horrors around him feasting on obscene cruelty with relish. The two opposites finally clash with predictable results Good and evil annihilate each other like matter meeting antimatter. But these dead men are not left to rot in peace . . . for the military has developed a technology to recycle them as soldiers Unisols to be exact to be placed in harm's way in lieu of regular men. Powerful emotionless and practically indestructible these new universal soldiers are shown off by the brass in a difficult hostagerescue mission which the Unisols pull off flawlessly.All seems peachy. However something during the rescue triggered a memory in Luc of his experiences in Viet Nam. He eventually deserts the unit followed by the dangerous Scott who has also recovered enough of his past to hate Luc and hunt him down. A selfserving reporter named Veronica helps Luc at first for a story then because she grows to care for this powerful yet childlike fishoutofwater. She's caught in the middle when all hell breaks loose.Typical Van Damme fare . . . only it isn't. There's a strange charm to his character a vulnerability and even hints of humor usually lacking in his acting. Van Damme conveys subtle emotions in his face especially in his large gentle eyes. He's still at his best when fighting but surprisingly good at playing this role. Oddly enough the acting in this movie is one of its strong points the other being special effects. The other performers are all solid from Ally Walker as Veronica to Lundgren as the incredibly creepy Scott. The director was wise enough to work within the limitations of his leading man so Luc's dialog is used sparingly. The fighting sequences are also well utilized fitting in with the plot. Weaknesses include the plot which is full of holes and exposition of key elements such as just how these fighting machines were created. The film at times had an abbreviated feel as if too much information was truncated that should have been included in the story.Still it remains overall a reasonably enjoyable film even for nonfans of martial artists like me. Van Damme actually fit his role and was likable as the unlikely hero. Though it's considered scifiaction this movie in truth occupies a strange niche one not easily identified. Worth watching when not in the mood for the usual fare.".

Fear not as I did before. If you don't like subtitles you will forget they are there. Do not read any more detailed reviews. Go without preconception. A Separation deserves all the plaudits it is getting and deserves a much wider audience.

It is so wellcrafted the twists of the plot throw up new moral dilemmas for all the protagonists which are explored sensitively and without judgement  so refreshingly unlike mainstream American films. I felt sympathy for all the characters even the threatening Hodjat full of misplaced rage which often erupts volcanically. And as a footnote the film felt like an intimate view into a society that our news media portray as monochromatic and extremely foreign. I am writing this a few days after the UK embassy in Tehran was ransacked".

We think these kinds of happenings and conflicts would not take place in our lives but with his realistic world and characters they seem so close and possible to anyone. Asghar Farhadi loves to put his audience in place of judge as his other pictures like About Eli or Fireworks Wednesday and here with no fear he takes us straight to a court room. But the thing is that the judge does not provide any help for us to make a clear judgment and surprisingly makes the situation even more complicated. Yes Farhadi doesn't want us to make a judgment He makes us watch and observe and leave the theater with a big fork in front of us.It Seems that any single decision creates another world full of forks and not taken ways.when nobody is clearly guilty and the line between black and white is so dim. And again here we are in Frhadi's powerful hands surprised to the end of the movie. You can't leave your chair even for one second because the story never lets you to lose even a single moment. And like a tennis ball we're always being shot from this side to the other. And finally we are the daughter shocked and disable to make a decision. May be we haven't seen or we don't want to see this side of life where nothing is clear when small lies and unimportant undone things and unsaid words gang up against us and turn to a big disaster. Frahadi has found his own world and his own language and his own version of life. Something we'd never seen before. We appreciate that. He can easily bombard us with information and surprise us with tiny details that seem nothing but like a snowball rolling down a slope they can form a big drama.".

Although maybe it won't for that very reason Jahar Panahi's repeat inability to attend his jury duties because of Iran's government refusal to issue him a travel permit a retrospective of his works including the 2006 Silver Bearwinning 'Offside' a variety of other Iranian productions and renewed demonstrations in Iran proper put the spotlight firmly on that country's elaborate yet constrained film industry. All that buzz may outshine the film's artistic value and prompt the jury to go for a less favored competitor. I should hope not for Farhadi manages once again to embed lots of social criticism into a straightlaced realistic narrative.As in 'About Elly' the story begins rather unassumingly and takes an abrupt turn into a spiral of increasingly dramatic events Nader and Simin are a couple about to break up over the question of moving abroad for which they have obtained a permit after waiting for 18 months. Nader however has his father to take care of who is suffering from Alzheimer's. Sirin still wants to leave but not without her daughter yes pun intended Termeh a somewhat shy bespectacled 11yearold who cannot accept her parents' breakup. She therefore decides to stay with her father which prompts Simin not to leave the country but move to her mother. Nader is thereby forced to hire someone to take care of his dad and a colleague of Sirin recommends the pregnant Razieh. Being deeply religious she should not work in a single man's household but her husband has been out of a job for a long time and is threatened with jail by his creditors. Her pregnancy and the necessity to attend to her daughter additionally stress her out. When Nader comes home one day to find his father left alone and tied to his bed a struggle with the returning Razieh ensues with catastrophic consequences for everyone around...This is a much more complicated setup than in 'About Elly' but it allows Farhadi to put a lot of additional information into his film as may be obvious to those who are just trying to follow the story I hesitate to give examples because the film is as of yet to be released in Iran which means an opensource comment such as this one needs to be carefully phrased. Much of the action takes place in courtrooms where judges try to negotiate between the parties without any lawyers present. There's a lot of familiarity and also a lot of menace which succeeds to create the same climate of anxiety accusation and deceit as in 'About Elly'. The realism of the narrative is embedded into a carefully planned scenography which makes almost every shot linger in the memory. And as in 'About Elly' the decisive moment the one that solves the mystery is omitted in the picture only to be explained verbally at the very end.What makes me feel even more for this film is the fact that it might be the last film of its kind from Iran for some time. Ali Samadi Ahadi the GermanIranian director of the comedy 'Salami Aleikum' and the upcoming documentary on the July 2009 protests 'The Green Wave' wrote that the film industry has come to a virtual standstill. 'Nader and Simin' was in development at the time of the protests since then regulations have become far more repressive with even established masters like Kiarostami or Makhmalbaf forced to work abroad and others threatened with jail and work prohibitions of whom Panahi is only the most famous example. All the more reason to give this film the credit it deserves  winning Berlin may cause Iran's bureaucrats to reconsider for cinema is almost the last link remaining to our world. Without film how could we understand that Iranians are a modern people with issues like our own and not dangerous fanatics as some media and politicians would have us believe?".

Watching Nader and Simin however proved that I was terribly mistaken.Asghar Farhady's obsession with the concept of judgment is once again the driving force behind his latest feature. The lifelike depiction of the Iranian courtroom which is in no way impartial places the audience in the Judge's seat from the very beginning. The extremely believable acting and insanely complex script compel the viewer to make up hisher mind just like when reading a court case. As for the screenplay I'm almost certain the events in this film actually happened in real life because in no way could one fabricate such a chaotically complex series of events so beautifully woven into a coherent whole.Despite being very Iranian in its narrative style and its depiction of Iranian culture the sanctity of Family faith commitment towards parents and married life I believe that this film could easily appeal to the Western audiences just like a film by Inaritu or Haneke although I'm pretty sure it won't be nominated for an Oscar for political reasons.After seeing About Elly I thought Farhady's success was just a onetime fling but coming out of the theater having watched Nader and Simin I was proud to have another Iranian director added to my international list of favorites.".

Foreign language film or not this is just an excellent excellent drama. You can't get a more Oscar worthy material than this. To me what makes A SEPARATION unique is that writerdirector Asghar Farhadi takes conflict secrets relationships and other elements that we're familiar with and mixes them with the culture religion and gender elements from that specific region. This film to a certain extent lets you in on how the justice system works in a place where some of us may be ignorant about. And it's really not about our way is better than theirs or vice versa it's just how different some things are doneAnd this is not just about a divorce or a separation of two individuals The film starts out that way and it ends on that note as well but what happens in between is more of a spinoff story or it stems from when the lead characters Nader and Simin stop being on the same page. A SEPARATION is a very dialoguedriven a very character driven story all the actors in this film are marvelous. When the tension is high they're extremely convincing I couldn't take my eyes off any of them especially lead actress Leila Hatami who holds a certain photogenic beauty.On one spectrum you have Nader and Simin with their daughter on the other end of the spectrum you have Hodjat and Razieh with their little adorable daughter. Because Simin takes time off from her marriage with the intent to divorce her husband Nader has to hire Razieh to take care of his father who suffers from Alzheimer's. An incident occurs that escalates into a courtroom drama but there is actually another incident or a card that Asghar Farhadi hides until it's time to show it further on in the story and the way everything progresses and eventually unravels keeps you intrigued. A big part of what draws me in is the film's depiction of Iranian law and traditions when it comes to divorces and allegations. What may be considered murder how important it is for an individual to see someone swear on a Koran how a judge deals with opposing alibis. I don't know how accurate it is but it's nothing short of interesting. It would certainly cause debate and discussion among the audiences as to the fairness of it all.

	schema:reviewBody "In Tehran the teacher Simin Leila Hatami has requested the divorce from her husband the bank clerk Nader Peyman Moadi. Simin wishes to live abroad to give a better life to her eleven yearold daughter Termeh Sarina Farhadi and Nader who is a family man but very arrogant wants to stay to take care of his father AliAsghar Shahbazi that has Alzheimer. Simin moves to the house of her mother and Nader hires the religious Razieh Sareh Bayat to take care of his father while he is working. Razieh is pregnant but she does not tell her husband Hodjat Shahab Hosseini who owes a large amount to the creditors that she is working. When she arrives with her daughter Somayeh Kimia Hosseiniat Nader's house she distracts and Nader's father goes to the street and she goes and gets him back home. On the next day when Nader arrives home with Termeh they find Nader's father tied up to his bed and Razieh and Somayeh are not at home. When they arrive at home Nader accuses Razieh of theft and expels her. Razieh feels offended and argues with him and Nader pushes her out at the front door. Razieh falls and has an abortion. She goes to the court with her husband and the witnesses are summoned to testify. Jodaeiye Nader az Simin or the separation of Nader and Simin is among the best Iranian films I have seen and is a fantastic drama that shows how flawed mankind is no matter in Iran Brazil Europe or wherever. Despite the different values of the Iranian society comparing with the Westerns ones all the characters are flawed therefore the plot is realistic. Nader is a family man that loves his father and his daughter but commits perjury is stubborn and arrogant and asks his acquaintances to lie. Simin uses the secret that Razieh had told her to take advantage. Termeh lies to save her father from justice. Razieh is religious and worried with Allah and sins but she was capable to lie fearing the reaction of her husband. Hodjat is a rude and impulsive man that is violent. The direction is perfect and the acting is topnotch. The story is engaging and believable and differences of cultures between Iran and Brazil are intriguing. I really recommend this film for any cinema lover or people interested in learning a little about the Iranian culture. My vote is ten.Title Brazil A Separao The Separation".

When she arrives with her daughter Somayeh Kimia Hosseiniat Nader's house she distracts and Nader's father goes to the street and she goes and gets him back home. On the next day when Nader arrives home with Termeh they find Nader's father tied up to his bed and Razieh and Somayeh are not at home. When they arrive at home Nader accuses Razieh of theft and expels her. Razieh feels offended and argues with him and Nader pushes her out at the front door. Razieh falls and has an abortion. She goes to the court with her husband and the witnesses are summoned to testify. Jodaeiye Nader az Simin or the separation of Nader and Simin is among the best Iranian films I have seen and is a fantastic drama that shows how flawed mankind is no matter in Iran Brazil Europe or wherever. Despite the different values of the Iranian society comparing with the Westerns ones all the characters are flawed therefore the plot is realistic. Nader is a family man that loves his father and his daughter but commits perjury is stubborn and arrogant and asks his acquaintances to lie. Simin uses the secret that Razieh had told her to take advantage. Termeh lies to save her father from justice. Razieh is religious and worried with Allah and sins but she was capable to lie fearing the reaction of her husband. Hodjat is a rude and impulsive man that is violent. The direction is perfect and the acting is topnotch. The story is engaging and believable and differences of cultures between Iran and Brazil are intriguing. I really recommend this film for any cinema lover or people interested in learning a little about the Iranian culture. My vote is ten.Title Brazil A Separao The Separation";

	schema:reviewBody "I've never seen an Iranian move but the country has a rich movie culture that has broken through with A Separation which won the Golden Bear best actor and best actress awards at Berlin earlier this year. And I can understand why.Don't go expecting lavish cinematography this is shot on hand held cameras or certainly on fairly shaky tripods throughout often under the harsh glare of fluorescent lighting that throws a watery blue cast over the action at times. But that is highly appropriate because this movie has a creeping sense of voyeurism throughout as the intensely private happenings of a family and perhaps country in turmoil steadily build up into a furious climax.The plot is complex to say the least but one can keep up by fully concentrating on each twist and turn of this microthriller.The oppression of the Koran in this staunchly Muslim country carries a heavy burden throughout the film and it's the most frequently used prop as one of the characters in particular the victim of a central crime seeks spiritual guidance throughout. It's importance and oppression is palpable.The story concerns the vain attempts of a wife superbly acted by Leila Hatami to leave Tehran with her husband to improve the life of their 12 year old daughter. But the husband cannot force himself to leave his Alzheimer's afflicted father behind and so stalemate ensues and divorce becomes the only alternative this results in a separation and so the father played to perfection by Peyman Moaadi is forced to hire a nurse to look after his desperately sad father during the day.One thing leads to another and inadvertently the husband pushes the nurse so that she ends up aborting her child.This sets off a horrendous chain of events that I will not reveal here for fear of spoiling it for you.Suffice to say the tension mounts throughout the movie and culminates in a heartbreaking decision for the couple's 12 year old daughter that is resolved in a way that Michael Hanneke would applaud vigorously.This movie deals with important themes of family loyalty more than love duty the oppression and folly of religion and pride.Without overbearing pride much of the consequences of this film would not happen. Time and again you silently shout at the screen just do the right thing and this mess will be resolved. They never do.It could almost be played for laughs so farcical are the the situations the main protagonists find themselves in. But this is no comedy far from it. It's a tearjerker and feels bitterly real believable and often futile.It's as good as its billing. See it.".

Couple arguing in front of a judge where when she was asked whether the man beats her because she wants a divorce saying no he is a good man but I want a divorce.This is a universal story set in Iran. Universal human emotion set in an Islamic country. It is difficult for me to pinpoint what the themes of this film. Yes it begins with a separation of a couple after years of marriage and having a daughter in stake. But that was only a trigger. A trigger to a journey that seeks the boundaries of human existences. A journey where things are not black and white but somewhere in between. The characters have their flaws but I somehow feel sympathy for them even for the one who is violent.

	schema:headline " A gripping and heartpounding universal masterpiece ... made in Iran ...";
	schema:reviewBody "A Separation is an intense and powerful examination of the eternal conflict between human emotions personal convictions and Law whether political or religious and it happens to be I believe the best film of 2011.The movie is set in Iran in an uppermiddle class area and features a series of unfortunate incidents all guided by sincere and genuine emotions but that nonetheless end up judged by the Islamic Law. Written and directed by Ashgar Farhadi the film is a triumph on the field of intelligence as it never patronizes the viewer by pointing a finger on an obvious 'antagonist'. Ultimately the victims are not innocent nor the accusers are wrongdoers and the only 'responsible' is a Law that fails to take into consideration human feelings.Still Law isn't negatively portrayed as it remains true to its obligatory neutrality a notion hinted in the very first scene of the film. Indeed the realism and intensity of the dialog a back and forth verbal fight between a wife and a husband sets in the very first minutes what would be the enthralling tone of the film. The core of the conflict is not unusual in family dramas it's about a child custody Simin Leila Hatami wants a divorce because her husband Nader Peyman Moadi refuse to emigrate in a country that would in her opinion provide a better education to her daughter Termeh Sarina Farhadi as a strongminded adolescent yet the hostage of an inextricable situation even more ironic because the two parents don't want to divorce.But Nader gives legitimate reasons to his refusal he must take care of his father an old eightysomething man suffering from Alzheimer disease. But he doesn't know you! Yes but I know him this brilliant exchange plays like the movie in microcosm it's all about contradictory opinions guided by legitimate emotions or convictions. When the opening scene ends those who agree with Simin's arguments understand Nader and viceversa. If there is ever one that's the greatest achievement of Farhadi's Oscarnominated screenplay still the force of the script enough couldn't have elevated A Separation to such a universal and miraculously unanimous acclaim. The film works as a perfect combination of writing acting and directing to such an extent that it could have easily been nominated to more than two Oscars without garnering much surprise.Farhadi's direction is perfect for this kind of narrative as it uses a handheld camera work in many scenes as to create the dizzying and uncomfortable effect of documentarylike realism. The film reminds of Cassavetes' naturalistic work in the way it conveys a sort of oneset room intimacy and place the viewer in the unsettling situation of a witness caught in the middle of a scene I mean by 'scene' an embarrassing and uncomfortable situation. We just see and watch and our hearts pound from these displays of aggressiveness hostility cries shouts and thankfully sometimes love and affection. Farhadi's film is a masterpiece of storytelling on that level proving that even plain dramas can be as emotionally engaging as thrillers and the film does it so well that the content can invite any audience to question its own legal system no more or no less immune from similar issues.Law has been established by men in order to find the truth within the chaotic succession of facts that can speak for two opposite sides but the genius of A Separation is that it deals with a particular situation where no one is aware of all the facts even the viewer is left with some hints and clues and can only assemble them as the movie progresses. Razieh Sareh Beyat is a young religious mother hired as a caregiver for Nader's father. She has a miscarriage and pretends it was caused by Nader's brutality. Nader claims he didn't know anything about the pregnancy and was upset because she left his father alone. The domino's effect introduces the peripheral characters as Simin wants to protect Termeh from Razieh's hot tempered fullofdebts husband Hodjat Shahab Hossein who vents his anger on the system and through his scenestealing performance paints an indirect social commentary on actual Iran.The film is full of confrontations that are some of the most realistic ever everything in the dialogs and the acting sounds true and make the whole experience so nervewracking that we never know if we're embarrassed to see these lives being destroyed or because the script didn't let us determine which side we're supposed to take. But A Separation is beyond these sterile considerations it's not about sides to take or opinions to make it's about the innate limits of Law. Law is even incarnated by a decent judge who shows some signs of reason and magnanimousness sometimes and sometimes can't handle Hodjat's outbursts of anger. In a way he embodies our position as the powerless observer of a situation that goes out of control because it engages a wide range of emotions sometimes positive sometimes negative but always sincere creative a psychological cocktail about to explode if a resolution doesn't come to appease the nerves.The resolution or let's say the conclusion is satisfying because it never betrays the film's 'philosophy' and leaves us with the penetrating sensation that we've just watched a miracle a modest creation whose emotional and intellectual force spoke some uncomfortable truths about human nature and its antagonism with Law's cold realism. And on the surface it also features an Iran far from the current stereotypes launched by the infamous Not Without My Daughter where women aren't all submissive chadorwearers and men macho wifebeaters.I feel terrible to pollute this review with these comments because they insult the intelligence of the film which already takes for granted that 'Iranian are normal people' but regarding the actual and scary political context I guess it's necessary".

Breakdown of families and society.The two daughters are at the heart of the story.Truth guilt the bitter disappointment of a child in her parents.Tense and narratively complex formally dense and morally challenging flawlessly crafted brilliantly performed and intimately photographed A Separation premiered at Berlinale where it won the Golden Bear for Best Film as well as the top prizes for Best Actor and Actress for its male and female ensembles.The idea for the film came to when I was sitting in the kitchen of my friend's flat in Berlin nearly one year ago. I was here preparing another film but I decided to do this one instead. I was smoking a cigarette in the kitchen listening to some Iranian music and then I decided to make it. The film is influenced by my personal experiences and the situation in Iran and also some abstract pictures I had in my mind. It was like a puzzle. The story was in my mind for some time but when I decided to make it it happened quickly.  FarhadiIt began with picture of a man with Alzheimer's.I found the button and made a suit.

The plot is patiently set up with its pieces slowly establishing in place in the first few scenes before snaring the audience into a wonderfully played 123minute thrill ride that places viewers right beside its characters  a feat that is executed through its seemingly naturallycrafted hand held cinematography in conjunction with genuine acting that rarely calls attention to itself. The film never resorts to flashy and glitzy elements to further its story  it absolutely has no need to  and proves that sincerity in all its forms whether it be in writing acting or directing no matter the budget nor technical limitations can result in work of the highest quality. To put it simply A SEPARATION is personally not only the best film of 2011 but arguably one of the most impressive lowerbudgeted dramas under 1 million dollars in the past decade.".

	schema:reviewBody "The new movie of Asghar Farhadi is a melodrama that captures the theme of responsibility and honesty as well as love religiosity and sacrifice. The movie starts with an argument for divorce between Simin Leila Hatami and Nader Peyman Moaadi before a judge in an Iranian court. Through their argument the main storyline of the movie becomes clear for us so that we become aware that Nader and Simin have been planning to move to a European country to provide better opportunities as Simin claims in the court for their only daughter Termeh Sarina Farhadi.Although Nader was interested in the idea of living abroad a few months earlier he refuses then because of his father AliAsghar Shahbazi who suffers from Alzheimer. When in the court Simin says to Nader your father does not even know you Nader answers but I know him. Here the responsibility of a child toward his father is very tangible. During the movie Simin insists on the idea of going abroad when Nader refuses she believes there is no other way for them except to divorce. Because Simin does not live with her husband and her daughter anymore Nader decides to hire a reliable and responsible nurse for his father. Therefore Razieh Sareh Bayat enters their house as the nurse.On the first day of her arrival Nader's father forgot to say that he needed to go to rest room. Therefore Razieh as a woman who really believes in strict rules of religion does not like to come again to take care of Nader's father. Actually she does not want to help an old man to go to rest room and even wash him. On a second thought Razieh agrees to become his nurse again just because she needs the money. One day Nader comes and sees that his father has fallen from his bed and does not move. He thinks his father just passed away. However he is still alive and becomes OK after a few minutes. Nader becomes very angry of what he calls  Razieh's irresponsibility because she left the house and there is no sign of her. When she comes back Nader brawls with her and pushes her out of the house and Razieh falls on the stairs that causes the abortion of her baby and a new challenge for Nader and Simin appears.Nader is accused of killing Razieh's baby intentionally. Razieh claims that Nader pushed her though he knew she was pregnant Nader denies it. In the court Razieh's husband Hodjat Shahab Hosseini who is a nervous man and does not have any job and has many debts fights several times with Nader and insults him harshly. Termeh knows that his father is lying because she is sure that Nader heard the story of Razieh's pregnancy when she was talking about it with Termeh's tutor Miss Ghahraii Merila Zare'i. She is right! Nader and Simin agree to give some money to them to finish the story democratically. However Nader insists on the idea of being sure whether he was guilty or not. That is why Nader asks Razieh to swear if he is guilty of the abortion of her baby. Although Hodjat really wants to get the money Razieh refuses to swear because she thinks she is not sure whether the abortion of her baby was because of Nader or the accident that she had on the same day. Due to her religious beliefs she does not want to get blood money From Nader when she is not sure whether he is guilty or not.Finally Nader and Simin agree to let Termeh choose her destiny by saying whether she prefers to live with her father or her mother. Like about Eli the previous film of Farhadi the ending of the story is not clear and it is up to the audience to guess whether Termeh wants to live with her father or her mother.There are scenes in the movie that are very impressive When Nader is washing his father's body while crying deeply it shows us how a child loves his father no matter he is too old or sick. In addition when Termeh asks his father about the reason that he told a big lie to the court we can understand once more how children monitor their parents' behavior as their reliable role models. In addition when Nader's father holds Simin's hand strongly which shows that he knows her well and no one even Razieh can look after him like the way that his daughterinlaw did in the past. Nader and Simin a Separation really deserves to be considered as one of the top 250 movies ever made. In the 21st century when we are surrounded by thousands of science fiction movies Nader and Simin a Separation is a good example of a reallife movie which can help people to revise their ideas about important concepts like responsibility love and sacrifice.".

The film manages to grasp and reflect human nature which is complex and multifaceted. You'd be left guessing and predicting the plot while trying to understand the characters and the choices they make. The film also aids us in understanding the roles of religion and culture... and more into human characteristics that go beyond those. A great film that i'm still thinking about and the acting and directing really shone through it all to help make this film so realistic and personal to the audience.

I agree with this answer from a film that comes from the other side of the world from a country which I perceive to have religion and politics utterly different from mine. Because the film transcends the detail it just shows the essence of being human. The characters just keep on trying to do the best for them or their family in credible situations which can apply to anyone and anywhere but the choices they make will conflict at one time or another with some moral or legal tenet. The husband the wife the daughter the old man's carer the carer's husband the daughter's teacher even the judge  they all want to do the right thing but they don't. Or do. Or don't. Or do. The beauty of this film is that it just tells the story. It doesn't take sides. It doesn't force on us an opinion on whether the choice was right or wrong. If it tried I probably wouldn't have liked it as much because it would have to conflict with some of my own views. Everyone has firm opinions until life carries you to situations like this film's and then nothing is black and white any more.For as long as there are creators like the director and writer of this film there is hope for the independents. A story like this will beat any Hollywoodesque film to the punch. It's flawlessly played and it's technically well done. It doesn't need more to move me.".

These three movies though not as remarkable perhaps as his previous and more famous trilogy the 'Apu trilogy' are nonetheless some of his finest and most subtle movies.Pratidwandi is set in a Calcutta rocked by political unrest and examines the varied reactions of the youth of the city to this unrest.

The film depicts the agony of youth stranded at the dawn of adulthood in the specific context of Calcutta in the late sixties.This was the age of hippies and budding Naxalism of Woodstock and the Vietnam war.The film reflects the bitterness and anger of an intelligent sensitive youth man engaged in the herculian task of finding a job.Siddharth has recently interrupted his medical studies after losing his father. His sister is earning but that is more because of her youth and femininity and although nothing specific is imputed her activities are perceived to be dishonorable. The younger brother is drifting towards shady political activity. Siddhartha's own encounters with women are sensitively portrayed. One charge that can never be made against Ray is lack of realism or anything less than utter honesty. He tells it exactly like it was.Ray seems to have indulged in some cinematic innovation. There are a number of eery dream sequences which reminded one of the opening sequence in Wild Strawberries. At some points the surrealism definitely seems artificial and overdone as when a whole crowds of job seekers waiting to be interviewed turns into skeletons in his imagination. Like Siddharth Ray is in love with Calcutta city of revolt and history and squalor.He has an unusual ability to condense everything into a short statement of a minute or so. These inspired climactic moments of dense compression punctuate Ray's work. In the present movie this comes towards the end when the seething dammed emotions of the young man explode in a demonstration of rage as the long wait of the job seekers waiting to be interviewed is prolonged by another hour.Not his best but his worst is ahead of other's best.".

Siddhartha had to leave his medicine study due to the sudden death of his father and ended up studying botany hence. The film moves through Kolkata with the eyes of Sidhartha mainly as an unemployed youth. The film marks the start of the famous Kolkata trilogy film series from Ray and went into history for winning President's award for best direction and screenplay and to be featured in 1972 Venice film festival. Ray used techniques that was years ahead of its time with common metaphor as below 1. Death  The film starts with a xray filming scene of Sidhartha's father's death and ends with the same metaphor of death when Sidhartha finally lands up a sales job in remote Bengal and hears the long lost bird's whistle from his childhood days just to be comprehended by the echoing voice of Ram Nam sath hai. Death stars and ends the film.2. Lost bird  Sidhartha's recollects the bird that his sister was so fond of during their childhood vacation. Sidhartha never finds the same old known bird in Kolkata. He even ventures new market which is famous for hosting all materials from the world. But even new market disappoints him. He spots the bird finally in rural Bengal Balurghat in his new medical sales job. But this time the sound of the known bird is in resonance with the rhymes of a dead man being carried away. May be this concept of the lost innocence has inspired modern bengali bands to compose songs as Holud pakhi. This is indeed remarkable as a metaphor for lost innocence and a human changing with age and circumstances.3. Flash backs  Sidhartha flashbacks in his medical college days often in the film and these college flashbacks as medical lectures are used to connect the story as he unfolds his struggling days in Kolkata. The most eminent is the sexual metaphor of a young modern lady crossing park street.The script was based on the story of Sunil Gangapadhya and the film moves very fast from the interview panel to Sidhartha's old friends mess to his old home. Sidhartha's inability to cope up with his ambitious sister on merit or with her affair with her boss is unknown or his revolutionary cousin makes up an interesting contrast to his character. Sidhartha's refusal for a sexual act which his friend sponsors speaks of his resilience and strength of character. Sidhartha also regrets probably gifting his brother the book from Che Guevara in his teenage birthday as his brother might have initiated his views on revolution from that gifted book. The only support that Sidhartha get is that from a door next girl who ultimately becomes his friend and may be his love interest eventually.Sidhartha character is one of the three shades that Ray used in Calcutta trilogy as below  a Sidhartha being the job hunter who finally compromises and leaves Calcutta. This character is by far the white shade in trilogy.b The character of Somanth in the second trilogy Middleman Jana aranya  who as a job hunter too leaves the hunt and becomes a businessman himself just to end up hiring his best friend's sister as an escort for sales favors. Somnath is the innocent looking grey shade in trilogy.c The character of Shymal in the film Company limited  Seemabaddha who finds epitome of success in corporate life through smart work ends up self accused although he makes to the coveted post of a general manager. Shymal is definitely darker of the other two shades if not a black.Overall a brilliant film and needs utmost attention when you see it. If you have struggled in a job search then this film will grip you more. Hope you all like this analysis as I pen up for the next two series on Middleman Jana aranya and company limited Seemabaddha. Your comments and views most welcome on the work of the genius !!".

	onyx:emotionText " The competitor or Pratidwandi was set up in a time of political turmoil in Bengal where a medicine drop out Siddhartha is looking out desperately for a job. Siddhartha had to leave his medicine study due to the sudden death of his father and ended up studying botany hence. The film moves through Kolkata with the eyes of Sidhartha mainly as an unemployed youth. The film marks the start of the famous Kolkata trilogy film series from Ray and went into history for winning President's award for best direction and screenplay and to be featured in 1972 Venice film festival.Ray used techniques that was years ahead of its time with common metaphor as below  1. Death  The film starts with a xray filming scene of Sidhartha's father's death and ends with the same metaphor of death when Sidhartha finally lands up a sales job in remote Bengal and hears the long lost bird's whistle from his childhood days just to be comprehended by the echoing voice of Ram Nam sath hai. Death stars and ends the film.2. Lost bird  Sidhartha's recollects the bird that his sister was so fond of during their childhood vacation. Sidhartha never finds the same old known bird in Kolkata. He even ventures new market which is famous for hosting all materials from the world. But even new market disappoints him. He spots the bird finally in rural Bengal balurghat in his new medical sales job. But this time the sound of the known bird is in resonance with the rhymes of a dead man being carried away. May be this concept of the lost innocence has inspired modern bengali rock bands to compose songs with birds as themes for lost innocence. This is indeed remarkable as a metaphor for lost innocence and a human changing with age and circumstances.3. Flash backs  Sidhartha flashbacks to his medical college days often in the film and these college flashbacks as medical lectures are used to connect the story as he unfolds his struggling days in Kolkata. The most eminent is the sexual metaphor of a young modern lady crossing park street.The script was based on the story of Sunil Gangapadhya and the film moves very fast from the interview panel to Sidhartha's old friends mess to his old home. Sidhartha's inability to cope up with his ambitious sister on merit or with her affair with her boss is unknown or his revolutionary cousin makes up an interesting contrast to his character. Sidhartha's refusal for a sexual act which his friend sponsors speaks of his resilience and strength of character. Sidhartha also regrets probably gifting his brother the book from Che Guevara in his teenage birthday as his brother might have initiated his views on revolution from that gifted book. The only support that Sidhartha get is that from a door next girl who ultimately becomes his friend and may be his love interest eventually.I personally think that Sidhartha's character is one of the three shades that Ray used in Calcutta trilogy as below  a Sidhartha being the job hunter who finally compromises and leaves Calcutta. This character is by far the white shade in trilogy.b The character of Somanth in the second trilogy Middleman Jana aranya  who as a job hunter too leaves the hunt and becomes a businessman himself just to end up hiring his best friend's sister as an escort for sales favors. Somnath is the innocent looking gray shade in trilogy.c The character of Shymal in the film Company limited  Seemabaddha who finds epitome of success in corporate life through smart work ends up self accused although he makes to the coveted post of a general manager. Shymal is definitely darker of the other two shades if not a black.Overall a brilliant film and needs utmost attention when you see it. If you have struggled in a job search then this film will grip you more. Hope you all like this analysis as I pen up for the next two series on Middleman Jana aranya and company limited Seemabaddha.";

Set in the age of hippies communism and newly born Naxalism when Woodstock and the Vietnam war were fresh the film reflects the bitterness and anger of an intelligent sensitive young man engaged in the Herculean task of finding a job. This is one film that rightly depicts the Calcutta of the late sixties.It was a difficult period for India and West Bengal. Corruption was rampant. Unemployment raged the youth of India. I absolutely loved the flashbacks and the way Xray digressions have been employed by Ray. The ending scene was particularly marvellous where the protagonist Siddharth chooses ideology over helplessness. No wonder the inspiring communist of Hazaron Khwashein Aisi is also named Siddharth.The film is stylistically experimental for Ray featuring techniques inspired by the French New Wave such as jumpcuts edgy framing dream sequences and sexual metaphors. Some of the experimental techniques which the film pioneered include photonegative flashbacks and Xray digressions. There are a number of dream sequences which reminded me of Bergman's Wild Strawberries.".

On the same account though his character progression would have arguably benefited from tighter pacing and a more economical running time since the near two hour length ensures that there is never any real sense of urgency in the air.

It has the same delicate beauty as Charulata though Siddhartha is a more expressive character than Charu. We know Charu through her looks and silences we know Siddhartha through his thoughts and dreams. This is Satyajit Ray's answer to the angry young man films that became so popular in India in the 1970s. Dhritiman Chatterjee gives a simmering performance as Siddharta and the supporting cast is also assured. It is a tale of frustration and its precious moments of calm are all the more moving for that.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must say that I was somewhat excited when my friend told me she got us tickets to the premiere of The Spirit especially since I've never been to a real premiere. It was an entertaining experience all except for when the film was rolling. I liked Sin City a lot and I thought 300 was intriguingly well made and quite entertaining. Let's just say that compared to 300 The Spirit entertains more like Howard the Duck. The entire film seems like a total farce an unfortunate mockery of Miller's unique style himself. It has been a very long time since I've seen a film with such little to no heart and hardly any soul. I must say that Sarah Paulson gave the greatest performance by far of anyone else as the Spirit's unconventional doctor. She is the sole source of any feeling or depth in the film. Macht was also at his best in the lead role when sharing scenes with Paulson otherwise he barely filled the part. I don't know if that was his fault however given that the character himself was depicted with very little depth overall. I never read the graphic novel but I'm going to go ahead and guess that this doesn't do it justice. How can I say that? Because novels build key characters into people that you care about whether you hate them or love them the characters stimulate your mind on some level or another. This is far from the case in this film. There is very poor development of the characters which the majority of potential watchers are unfamiliar with. Sam Jackson has unfortunately chosen another terrible role as the nonintriguing villain the Octopus. Jackson however does give us some of his crazy wild eyed antics that we've grown to accustomed to although his character falls flat for the most part especially considering his opposite on the screen Scarlett Johansen. It almost seems as if Miller was asleep on the set when her scenes were shot. She's THAT bad in this film with a deeply sub par androidlike performance. Eva Mendes did what she could to somewhat save the film from being a complete and total joke although it's pretty close to being just that. She plays the bling digging female lead opposite Macht. Now quite possibly the most annoying characters ever portrayed on film are the Octopus's cloned henchmen which were frighteningly reminiscent in annoyance levels of.......... dare i say it... Jar Jar Binks. My four year old nephew would surely find some entertainment value there. This film ultimately succumbs to its poor writing and direction which are almost cleverly masked by the signature visual style of Miller which is hypnotizing at times. Unfortunately it's hardly hypnotizing enough to mask the true soulless identity of The Sprit.Crimsonica".

	onyx:emotionText "I must say that I was somewhat excited when my friend told me she got us tickets to the premiere of The Spirit especially since I've never been to a real premiere. It was an entertaining experience all except for when the film was rolling. I liked Sin City a lot and I thought 300 was intriguingly well made and quite entertaining. Let's just say that compared to 300 The Spirit entertains more like Howard the Duck. The entire film seems like a total farce an unfortunate mockery of Miller's unique style himself. It has been a very long time since I've seen a film with such little to no heart and hardly any soul. I must say that Sarah Paulson gave the greatest performance by far of anyone else as the Spirit's unconventional doctor. She is the sole source of any feeling or depth in the film. Macht was also at his best in the lead role when sharing scenes with Paulson otherwise he barely filled the part. I don't know if that was his fault however given that the character himself was depicted with very little depth overall. I never read the graphic novel but I'm going to go ahead and guess that this doesn't do it justice. How can I say that? Because novels build key characters into people that you care about whether you hate them or love them the characters stimulate your mind on some level or another. This is far from the case in this film. There is very poor development of the characters which the majority of potential watchers are unfamiliar with. Sam Jackson has unfortunately chosen another terrible role as the nonintriguing villain the Octopus. Jackson however does give us some of his crazy wild eyed antics that we've grown to accustomed to although his character falls flat for the most part especially considering his opposite on the screen Scarlett Johansen. It almost seems as if Miller was asleep on the set when her scenes were shot. She's THAT bad in this film with a deeply sub par androidlike performance. Eva Mendes did what she could to somewhat save the film from being a complete and total joke although it's pretty close to being just that. She plays the bling digging female lead opposite Macht. Now quite possibly the most annoying characters ever portrayed on film are the Octopus's cloned henchmen which were frighteningly reminiscent in annoyance levels of.......... dare i say it... Jar Jar Binks. My four year old nephew would surely find some entertainment value there. This film ultimately succumbs to its poor writing and direction which are almost cleverly masked by the signature visual style of Miller which is hypnotizing at times. Unfortunately it's hardly hypnotizing enough to mask the true soulless identity of The Sprit.Crimsonica";

	schema:reviewBody "I love the interview with Lorenzo Semple Jnr screenwriter for 'Flash Gordon' when he suggests that the film would have been a big hit if only they'd been able to market it as a movie that would be a cult classic in thirty years. He goes on to explain what the core problem is A cult film by definition has fanatical supporters ... just not a lot of them. Those who 'get' the film will keep it alive forever but Joe Moviegoer won't care if he ever sees it again. And so I turn to 'The Spirit' a film which has similar qualities to 'Flash Gordon' bad enough to be awesome tongue firmly in it's cheek and gentle satire in it's hand.'The Spirit' manages to be wondrous and infuriating. A visual feast Frank Miller was the perfect choice to bring the film to life. On the other hand the dialogue is often so cheesy and the characters so over the top that the movie never allows you to be lulled into that wonderful moment of forgetting that you're watching a movie. There isn't a single character in the movie who talks like a real person. They all talk like well comic book archetypes gruff commissioner megalomaniacal super villain brilliant evil assistant sultry femme fatales loyal and uninteresting love interest and on and on. Take Samuel L Jackson's character 'The Octopus' for example. It is a character that Jackson was born to play and Sam throws every ounce of his endlessly entertaining and over the top style into the character. It works and he plays the part brilliantly because he takes ridiculous dialogue and ridiculous material and has wild amounts of fun with it. The cast by and large follow his lead. Scarlett Johansson is hilariously withering with her acerbic barbs to The Octopus' clone lackeys all of whom are played with deadpan wit and verve by Louis Lombardi. It is hard in fact not to feel some pity for Gabriel Macht who has to play Bud Abbott to a cast of rollicking scenechewing Lou Costellos in an overacting competition. It all works wonderfully if you're willing to view the film as uncharitably being unintentionally funny or more genuinely as a gentle lampoon of comic book films by one of the great figures of the graphic novel genre.Frank Miller takes 'The Spirit' and has great fun with it. It is quirky at times hamhanded at times but lovingly made. A brilliant Noirist Miller actually has much better luck in 'The Spirit' in moments of levity. The noir angles of this film don't work unless designed as a kind of selfrighteous satire. The noir feels forced and dramatic moments are mercilessly skewered by the corny dialogue that a helpless Gabriel Macht delivers with straightlaced determination. 'The Spirit' has the look of 'Sin City' and the heart of 'Flash Gordon.' When it works it works well but the film is a terrible mess whenever it is trying to be serious.So is it worth the ride? I think so if you go in with the proper expectations. There's not really anything new visually if you've seen 'Sin City' or '300'  both Miller works of course  but that didn't make them any less interesting to me. Plenty of humour where it may or may not have been planned and the potential to be a cult classic. This is the kind of movie you can best enjoy in the company of friends and a cold six pack. Look for diamonds and you're looking for too much. And if nothing else Eva Mendes has never looked better on film than she does here. That's got to stand for something right?".

This film is an action comedy much like the popular genre in the 80's and 90's except done in a more comicbook style.The biggest mistake or misconception that people make about this film is that this is NOT Sin City. Although directed by and written for the screen by Frank Miller this is not based on a Frank Miller graphic novel and in no way should be compared to Sin City. I guess the confusion comes from the very similar visual style of the film but that's definitely where the similarities end. The first 10 minutes of the film make it blatantly obvious that this film is not meant to be taken too seriously with it's over the top action sequences and comicpanel dialogue. Just think of The Spirit as a visual comic book and it will make a whoooooooole lot more sense. The hero of the film The Spirit was hilarious! Tough and heroic and almost indestructible except for the one weakness in his pants as in he has a soft or hard spot for women......ALL women!!!! Still I couldn't help but laugh at his awesome pickup lines as they were delivered with such sincerity and conviction that I almost believed thoughs lines would work in real life! Sam Jackson was brilliant as The Octopus an evil eccentric and over the top villainmad scientist! In fact come to think of it what's not to like about this movie? It's actionpacked funny as hell and the women in this film are all beautiful!!! Eva Mendes looks the best I've ever seen her in this film and the women alone should be enough to see this movie!I think that now days people are so used to special effects that nothing impresses us anymore and we forget the real reason why we go and see films such as The Spirit to escape reality for an hour and a half and to be entertained. Think about it although this film isn't pushing any visual boundaries by todays standards think about if it came out 10 years ago i.e. pre Sin City or Matrix...people would have been blown away!!! I do agree that the genre of this film does only appeal to a small minority of people and for that reason a lot of more mainstream cinema goers won't get it but that's fine it just means that this film will get a cult following of fans that DO get it and enjoy it for what it is. So if you still want to see The Spirit despite everything you've heard about the film and you're not a robot and actually want to have your own opinion just turn off your brain grab some pop corn or beer or both and leave all Oscarwinning expectations at the door and you should enjoy it! The only thing I feel sorry for about this film is poor Muffin!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like this but the main actor who played the Spirit was just plain awful. And everyone acting was dreadful the writing is dreadful and the direction is dreadful. Maybe Frank Miller wanted that actors to Over act and over act they did BIG TIME. Sam L. Jackson is so over the top that it was painful. We were laughing at some scenes not because it was that funny it was just that embarrassing. The first fight scene not giving anything away that the Octopuss had with the Spirit was force and confusing and so out of place and completely uninteresting.This movie is STYLE over SUBSTANCE. And it's hugely disappointing from the guy that was part of The 300 and Sin City. I guess every good person have their bad movies. I think perhaps Miller wanted the characters to be cartoonish. At one point I wouldn't have been surprised to see an anvil drop on someone's head thats how ridiculous this movie was. Perhaps one has to be a fan of the comic book... or graphic novel in some circle in order to truly enjoy this. I went with three other friends and 3 out of 4 of use thought it was awful and the other person just said it wasn't that bad.That voice over of the spirit was just bothersome the entire movie. I was thinking... please for the love of god shut him up. The Spirit's voice over is irritating like Jock itch.Now for the other actors Eva Mendes is as beautiful as always and at one point I heard at least 10 independent dayums go out like some said it once at the grand canyon and you got 9 echos... .DAYUM! dayum dayum dayum dayum...The other ones didn't get to do anything except there are moments of irritating joy in the Octopuss' creations. The Spirit gets a 4 out of 10 for not actualizing the film that it could have been. It is a pass.".

	schema:headline " Lionsgate and Frank Miller are officially on Santa's naughty list with this Xmas disaster film";
	schema:reviewBody "The Spirit is a film with few virtues. There's a fingerful but that's it.Gabriel Macht delivers a certain charisma in the titular role as Will Eisner's classic middleclass superhero. This is his first time carrying a movie and had the focus been shifted more on him his antics and his conflicts it would have been a better film. We witness some lovely moments when The Spirit talks about the love he has for his city echoing something at the very heart of the superhero mythos. One scene has him even using the city as a shield a weapon and a guide in his role as its guardian. These are poignant moments that evoke that somewhere underneath all the terribleness there might have been a spark of a good film here.That's where all the virtues end. People will probably gravitate to the cinematography of Bill Pope which does its best to marry Frank Miller's Sin City with the pulp comics of The Spirit's origins. But as pretty as the cinematography does look here and there most of it is too busy too dark and too careless. As a film that tries to show the protagonist's relationship with his city the cinematography should have created a sense of being in a vast metropolis. Instead the visuals feel completely greenscreened and the effect is that the film ends up looking like it was shot on a stage instead of in a wide open city. There is also something that feels unfinished about the greenscreening process as though some more work needed to be done and as such the film has the look of the cut scenes out of late 90's full motion video games with the characters standing out from rendered CGI effects like sore thumbs.This is Frank Miller's first time out as a solo director. He is credited with codirecting Sin City and after seeing this film one realizes that Miller had very little to do with the physical directing on that film. It's sad to see one of the greatest comic book creators of all time helpless in trying to do justice to Will Eisner's creations. Miller even casts himself as a police officer whose head gets ripped off and used as a blunt weapon in the film's opening. One wonders if that was CGI or if the lack of any thinking going into this film can be blamed on Miller's headlessness. Either way it's an apt metaphor for a project that steams forward without any direction. The film is a mess of tones and genres. Scenes tend to go on forever without anywhere to go in the first place. There's an overuse of flashbacks. And most of the dialogue is delivered in soliloquy including a scene where The Spirit talks to a cat for 5 minutes. There are no subtleties in delivery pacing or acting. Everything is blunt harsh and cold. The audience knows everything in the first 15 minutes and it takes the rest of the characters an hour to catch up. It's frustrating busy and excruciating to watch. Even attempts at humor fall flat. A running joke with 24's Louis Lombardi is amateur in its rendition. The acting is where Miller's lack of filmmaking chops shows most prominently. Sam Jackson plays the Octopus a villain whose face was never shown in Eisner's comics and rightfully so. Jackson is fresh off of a plane full of snakes and still acting like it. He plays the same tough character he always plays  shooting off big guns while shooting off his even bigger mouth. It's beginning to get boring and he needs to seek out more parts that explore his range. In order to make up for having no character depth or any credibility as a villain Jackson and his henchwoman played by the vastly overrated Scarlett Johansson go through more costume changes than a Vegas strip show. Jackson goes from dressing like a pimp to a muttonchopped samurai and even I can't make this up a monocled goosestepping heilhitlering Nazi in an offensive scene that seems like a bad pun on the classic Patton.Further to the acting there is a bevy of female characters that clutter this film in an attempt to create some element of pulp sex drama. Johansson's Silken Floss is just money thrown down the drain as she brings nothing to the movie. I've never understood her appeal and this film is perhaps best proof of her need to hire an acting coach. The Morgenstern character is a timewaster and eats up screen time lecturing the audience on the Electra principle Miller you created a character named Elektra you have a fascination with it we get it but it has no place in this film. To believe her character we'd have to believe that a rookie cop would be the only one to notice a gigantic clue two days after a crime scene has been cleared. Sarah Paulson and Eva Mendes both in terribly written roles try the hardest and as an audience member I appreciated that.The free screening I attended last night had a number of rows oddly empty from the get go. And within 10 minutes about twenty people had already gotten up and left. The rest of us stayed because it was cold outside and perhaps hoping that things would only get better. They didn't. After the film we had a unique experience where audience members cultivated together like strangers at a traffic accident to criticize the film. People were upset over a film that failed in every possible way a film can fail and yet the advertising campaign paints it as a brilliant exciting holiday adventure. I assure you it's not.Lionsgate this is a train wreck. If this is your idea of giving your audience a holiday present honestly shame on you.".

This isn't Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai'! Nor is Frank Miller's paean to Will Eisner a parody or sendup as many confusedly carped because it's breathtakingly faithful to pun intended the spirit of Eisner's creation. It's supposed to be funny people! The exaggeration  tossing in the kitchen sink  echoes the source material.In thousands of comic panels the late Denny Colt was knifed gunshot bludgeoned tossed from buildings dragged through sewers and betrayed by femme fatales who nevertheless fell in some measure to his boyish indefatigable charm even if they were clonking him on the head.Miller had his hands full trying to distill all those decades of The Spirit's adventures  and those beautiful women!  into one story.Some compromises had to be met. Samuel L. Jackson's reasonably restrained performance compared to the portrayal in the comics of the conflated character of Dr. Cobra the villain who in the books administered the lifeprolonging serum to the late Denny Colt and the Octopus seems outrageous to the novice viewer who never read the series. Likewise the series' characters of P'Gell and Sand Saref are combined in the film.The Spirit's boyish gallantry comes off as cavalier womanizing when so many of the important women in his life are crammed into one story. Though the script treats Ellen Dolan mostly as a doormat the arc of Denny and Sand's starcrossed love is treated more tenderly.Louis Lombardi delivers one hilarious line after another as the dimbulb eagertoplease irrepressiblypositive clone set as he himself manifests a hybrid avatar of Stooge Curly Howard and William Bendix.Visually this film is one of the most stunningly rendered cinematographic pieces I've encountered even if the task required muting the elaborateness of Eisner's surrealistic cityscapes. At first as a purist I cringed at Miller's choice of sneakers as Our Hero's chosen footwear yet found the choice arresting in the Rotoscope scenes where they enhanced following the shadowy figure through the snowy night.There are other problems of artistic choice of which Miller cannot be as readily absolved.Faced with the requisite compression of seven decades of noir and comedy Miller veered The Spirit's character more toward dark harshness than the lightheartedness and optimism one associates with the character. More a rendering of Miller's Dark Knight Returned than of the plucky BoyScout Wonder Central City's guardian growls more often than whistles.Still  fun romp Frank.Shame that so many walked into the wrong movie.".

	schema:headline " A Dark Madcap Love Letter to the Master of Sequential Illustration by a Crafty Student";
	schema:reviewBody "Movies based on comic book characters have invaded theaters like a fleet of ships nowadays. The main protagonists of the fourcolor opuses either have super powers andor cool gadgets. The title hero of the quirky overthetop but romantic The Spirit has none but that's doesn't make him uninteresting especially in the surprisingly competent scriptdirectorial hands of Frank Miller the Sam Peckinpah of the comic book industry.Based on the 1940s comic strip created by the late Will Eisner the master of sequential illustration and an influencefriend of Mr. Miller's Central City cop Denny Colt adept GQ modellike Gabriel Macht is killed in action. He doesn't stay dead for long when he leaves his grave and offers his deathcheating advantage by being a super cop to top magistrate Dolan The Wonder Years alum Dan Lauria. The reason of this resurrection isn't so good Colt's the guinea pig of egomaniacal mobster The Octopus Oscar nominee Samuel L. Jackson who's a ball of fun here who's also immortal but wants bona fide magical immortality by getting a vase containing the blood of demigod Hercules. A screw up occurs involving international jewel thiefblack widow assassin Sand Saref sexy Eva Mendes of Training Day an old childhood girlfriend of Colt's. Guns are drawn knives are thrown and sexual pheromones creep in the cold air of the metropolis.If you find this film a Batman ripoff you're so laughable to feel that way  Eisner went to Dewitt Clinton High School Bronx NY with Batman framer Bob Kane and if you think Mr. Miller should stick to comic books you're certifiable He could balance both film and comic books if need be.After codirecting the cinetranslation of own crime saga Sin City with Robert Rodriguez the Spy Kids and El Mariachi sagas Planet Terror and producing the adaptation of his take of the Thermopylae battle 300 by Zack Snyder Watchmen Miller proves to be up to the task of helming a film featuring a mentor's signature character whose own obscurity is enough to reason why Mr. Miller handled the film. I ask hardcore fanboys who demean Miller's treatment who else could have direct it? Spielberg? Santa Claus? The Easter Bunny? The Tooth Fairy? Martians? Sure there's the overthe top moments where Jackson's dressed as a samurai and a Nazi and when Jackson clobbers Macht with a toilet ! but if you've read Miller's work you know what to expect darkness mixed with madcap humor.

	onyx:emotionText "Movies based on comic book characters have invaded theaters like a fleet of ships nowadays. The main protagonists of the fourcolor opuses either have super powers andor cool gadgets. The title hero of the quirky overthetop but romantic The Spirit has none but that's doesn't make him uninteresting especially in the surprisingly competent scriptdirectorial hands of Frank Miller the Sam Peckinpah of the comic book industry.Based on the 1940s comic strip created by the late Will Eisner the master of sequential illustration and an influencefriend of Mr. Miller's Central City cop Denny Colt adept GQ modellike Gabriel Macht is killed in action. He doesn't stay dead for long when he leaves his grave and offers his deathcheating advantage by being a super cop to top magistrate Dolan The Wonder Years alum Dan Lauria. The reason of this resurrection isn't so good Colt's the guinea pig of egomaniacal mobster The Octopus Oscar nominee Samuel L. Jackson who's a ball of fun here who's also immortal but wants bona fide magical immortality by getting a vase containing the blood of demigod Hercules. A screw up occurs involving international jewel thiefblack widow assassin Sand Saref sexy Eva Mendes of Training Day an old childhood girlfriend of Colt's. Guns are drawn knives are thrown and sexual pheromones creep in the cold air of the metropolis.If you find this film a Batman ripoff you're so laughable to feel that way  Eisner went to Dewitt Clinton High School Bronx NY with Batman framer Bob Kane and if you think Mr. Miller should stick to comic books you're certifiable He could balance both film and comic books if need be.After codirecting the cinetranslation of own crime saga Sin City with Robert Rodriguez the Spy Kids and El Mariachi sagas Planet Terror and producing the adaptation of his take of the Thermopylae battle 300 by Zack Snyder Watchmen Miller proves to be up to the task of helming a film featuring a mentor's signature character whose own obscurity is enough to reason why Mr. Miller handled the film. I ask hardcore fanboys who demean Miller's treatment who else could have direct it? Spielberg? Santa Claus? The Easter Bunny? The Tooth Fairy? Martians? Sure there's the overthe top moments where Jackson's dressed as a samurai and a Nazi and when Jackson clobbers Macht with a toilet ! but if you've read Miller's work you know what to expect darkness mixed with madcap humor. If you don't this is a fantasy world. Accept it or don't.Miller uses what he's learned from Rodriquez here and uses it well. The mixmatch of cornball movie dialogue Miller's a film noir fan as long as a lover of the Warner Bros's animated Looney Tunes shorts vintage fashion and modern technology playfully echoes Batman The Aninated Series and the use of digital background and minimal sets gives the film an avantgarde stage play atmosphere.Game are the actors.

	schema:headline " I have a city as my weapon  The Spirit";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a lot to like about Frank Miller's debut as a solo director. The Spirit is shot with a similar style as his last film Sin City based upon his own graphic novels and the imagery is quite stunning at times. I'm not familiar with Will Eisner's series for which the film is based but after viewing scenes in stark black and white with the bright red tie and blindingly white sneaker soles coupled with the end credits artwork I have to believe Miller did his best to bring those drawings to the big screen. The story too is intriguing showing a superhero that works directly with the police he is his own branch of the department known by all and brought into cases like a detective. It's a refreshing take on the whole vigilante stigma that will be explained once his origins are relayed. However while there is a lot to like there is a lot more that will just make you shake your head in disappointment.I've been told that the comic is very pulpy and hardboiled with shades of camp and I hope that is true because the film goes overboard in all of those categories. I enjoy a little humor and some fun but when it's inside of a film that is shot so darkly so seriously the juxtaposition becomes forced. There are plenty of good oneliners and the quick dialogue and ratatat banter can be exciting but mostly it is just plain laughable. What is The Octopus's fascination with eggs? He does not like egg on his face he hates those brown eggs that come from chickens and one of his henchmen is named Huevos. Maybe I'm missing something there by not having read the comic it just went way too long. Even the fight scene at the beginning between he the villain and The Spirit's hero works only in moderation. You become intrigued by the fact neither can be hurt they heal from every wound and The Octopus's cryptic talk about how they are two men uniquely alike makes you beg the question of what happened to them. However the fight keeps going for ten more minutesthey bludgeon each other over and over again until they just decide to stop. I won't even go into their horridly ominous declarations of how they will meet again real soon or how they'll kill the other all kinds of dead. They just trade empty threats like that and go their separate ways  it's all kind of surreal actually and no toilets are not always funny.The film is really just an exercise in excess and how unless one is experienced enough to handle that much material it will all fall apart as a result. As far as pacing goes the story becomes disjointed with abrupt interludes a short scene between the police commissioner and his doctor daughter that really goes nowhere except to explain Denny's relationship with Ellen and all those somewhat stupid vignettes with Lotelei the angel of death and overlong exposition. Trying to go fullbore into style hurts scenes by making them too intricate and overblown. The obligatory bad guy telling the good guy his plan because the good guy is about to die scene lasted an eternity. Miller attempts to wow us with his sharp angles and quick cuts to closeups dragging this Nazithemed exchange out forever. Paz Vega is brought in for eyecandy and a necessary allegiance reversal before she is gone from the film again The Spirit's quips serve only to make The Octopus talk even longer and being played by the master of bombast and extreme Samuel L. Jackson talk he will Scarlett Johansson's speech does much the same in her matteroffact emotionless delivery for the entire film and the henchmen I like Louis Lombardi and the schtick is funny the first couple times get overused killing the joke before it even became cute. You watch the scene waiting for our hero to escape you know he will you just hope you don't have to be bored so much waiting for the inevitable.As far as the acting goes besides characters being mishandled scriptwise all involved do an admirable job. It appears that they are all having fun in their hardboiled way hamming it up to the camera with broad facial expressions and overthetop speech patterns. I'd be interested to see what a guy like Rian Johnson could have done with this someone who showed a sense of rhythm and timing in his stylized speech with Brick someone who has a better understanding of pace than Miller perhaps.With that said I really liked Gabriel Macht as our lead The Spirit. A relative noname this guy must carry the film on his shoulders and I think he did the job well. There was always a sly smile on his face whether getting beatup on the verge of death or flirting with the multitude of sexy women. He had the tone right and made it fun even getting the deep raspy narration correct for the many voice of God moments as he explains what is happening. And since I mentioned the sexy women there were some effective parts and some not so much. Eva Mendes was on the right page as well as Stana Katic probably my favorite part of the movie as Morgenstern. She steals every scene she is in with her street cop accent and genuine sparkle in her eye with every compliment. Johansson and Vega though were purely eyecandy giving some stilted performances. But I blame Miller for that possibly being unsure how to direct them to get what he needed. Being coy and confident in your delivery is one thing looking bored is a complete other.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's not that I feel especially motivated to write a review about this film I just feel that all the negative reviews fail to take into account people like me who know little of the genre or comics books and have no desire to compare it to Sin City which I have seen.I watched The Spirit on TV recently and I enjoyed it! There I've said it. I thought it was stylish throughout. It had lots of tongueincheek selfdeprecating oneliners which I actually laughed at. I really didn't have a problem with the plot.

	schema:reviewBody "I was afraid to almost see the movie because of all the hype and advertising they did. Too many movies have been ruined for me because of hype they just end being a let down.However the Spirit did not disappoint. It actually exceeded my expectations. Frank Miller being a comic man in the soul does a great job of putting that compassion to his art onto the screen. Visually amazing and it kills me when people say there was no pacing or  the timing was awful. Have you ever read a comic book? The dialogue isn't read that way because of Miller's inexperience it's because he wanted it that way. That is how a comic book reads short and choppy and points with boisterous outbursts and profound lines. Don't criticize something just because you don't understand it.Along those same lines many people have been complaining about the juxtaposition of the theme. That it's trying to be funny and dark at the same time. I am just going to say it's safe to assume that none of these people have actually read the original comic book because that is basically the whole point of the Spirit. He is an almost melancholy character in a chaotic city that has turned to all but jokes and fun. Suggesting a separation between him and the living world.Comic book fans will love this movie by far the best comic book adaptation of this recent comic movie trend. Miller stays true to what he feels passionate about and true to his late friends comic. Well done. Bravo.".

	schema:headline " That Windmill Windup";
	schema:reviewBody "Alibi Ike is a mildly amusing baseball comedy based on Ring Lardner's character of a pitcher with an excuse for everything. It's a pretty good example of Joe E. Brown's hayseed type character at the height of his popularity. And of course because A Midsummer Night's Dream was held up in release Alibi Ike marks the debut of Olivia DeHavilland on the silver screen.Although Olivia has little enough to do in this film which is strictly a Joe E. Brown show she's one pretty thing here. She was only 19 when she made this film and would have to wait through another film besides this one and the Max Reinhardt extravaganza before settling into her Warner Brothers niche as crinolined heroine yearning for Errol Flynn to win her as he did in Captain Blood.Joe E. Brown took naturally to this role possibly because he was known as a very big baseball fan in real life. Playing his ever harried manager in Alibi Ike is William Frawley who in real life was also known as a baseball aficionado. Brown's son Joe L. Brown didn't follow his father into show business he became a well respected baseball executive best known as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates world championship team of 1960.It's worth seeing the film alone to see how Joe E.

	onyx:emotionText "Alibi Ike is a mildly amusing baseball comedy based on Ring Lardner's character of a pitcher with an excuse for everything. It's a pretty good example of Joe E. Brown's hayseed type character at the height of his popularity. And of course because A Midsummer Night's Dream was held up in release Alibi Ike marks the debut of Olivia DeHavilland on the silver screen.Although Olivia has little enough to do in this film which is strictly a Joe E. Brown show she's one pretty thing here. She was only 19 when she made this film and would have to wait through another film besides this one and the Max Reinhardt extravaganza before settling into her Warner Brothers niche as crinolined heroine yearning for Errol Flynn to win her as he did in Captain Blood.Joe E. Brown took naturally to this role possibly because he was known as a very big baseball fan in real life. Playing his ever harried manager in Alibi Ike is William Frawley who in real life was also known as a baseball aficionado. Brown's son Joe L. Brown didn't follow his father into show business he became a well respected baseball executive best known as general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates world championship team of 1960.It's worth seeing the film alone to see how Joe E. Brown does that exaggerated windmill windup when he pitches. Funny as all get out but in real life a runner with the speed of Ernie Lombardi would have stolen two bases on him. Who's Ernie Lombardi a Hall of Fame catcher with the Cincinnati Reds during this same period who was a legend for his lack of speed.

I'm sure many will find him annoying but the jokes were written very well and Brown carries them without a hitch. de Havilland is nice as the love interest and the supporting cast is nice as well. The highlight is when Brown tells his fielders to sit down behind the pitcher's mound so they can watch him strikeout the side.

I think I read somewhere can't remember where so consider this unverified that in real life Brown was very athletic and the reason he wore full business suits long sleeved shirts and loose fitting baseball uniforms throughout this movie was that his rock hard abs and welldefined biceps conflicted with the loose and easygoing character he portrayed on the screen.Got a free afternoon or evening?

Brown is lively enough however to engender enough good will to watch the fastmoving film to the end.  Frawley is a standout as the manager and Karnes Harvey and Dehavilland head a splendid supporting cast.  If you have any tolerance for slapstick this is pleasant enough fluff.Yet the most interesting thing about the movie is that the climactic scene in the movie takes place at a NIGHT game at a thenrecentlybuilt Wrigley field.  For many years until the last 80's Wrigley was the only stadium which had no lights installed and no scheduled night games.  Apparently I have come to learn just yesterday that many teams including the Cubs experimented with temporary lighting for occasional big games at night in the mid30's until Ebbets Field in Brooklyn became the first stadium with permanently installed lights in 1938. Still it seems strange to watch a night game at Wrigley as it was in 1935. For that alone baseball fans will find this worth watching.  One final note in real life the Cubs went from cellardwellers in '34 to NL champs in '35 which is exactly what the movie reflected even though the film was in the can by July of 1935 and there was no way that Enright and company could have known that the Cubs would win the pennant that year.  Interesting. 6 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some time ago I caught Joe E. Brown in another baseball flick Elmer the Great. His character Elmer in that one was quite arrogant and not at all the way I remembered Brown from flicks I caught as a kid back in the Fifties. In Alibi Ike Brown brings back that old time magic for me right down to that siren like Heeeyyyyy whenever he gets into a tight spot. And then there's that fantastic double triple loopy windmill windup he makes when setting up to pitch. Man I could have used that delivery as a Little Leaguer to confound the opposing batters. In both baseball flicks Brown's character winds up on the Chicago Cubs this time by way of Sauk Center. I guess we've all run across someone at one time or another who makes excuses for just about everything but with Frank X. Farrell Brown he just never gives it a rest. Most of the time I had to wonder why too because a lot of the situations on screen were slice of life stuff like buying an engagement ring. I guess Ike was so much into the Alibi persona he just couldn't quit. Speaking of which that was quite the double talk line he threw at the jeweler I don't remember Brown ever using that before.After a false start with his gal Dolly Farrell rises to the occasion on both the ball field and in the romance department. Some of the baseball stuff is just plain silly like calling all the players around to the pitcher's mound while Ike strikes out the side. There's also a brief interlude involving mobsters attempting to get Ike to 'throw' some games but it's done somewhat haphazardly and blows by without much consequence. It's the physical comedy that entertains along with Joe E. Brown's unique facials that make Alibi Ike a fun diversion.".

In Alibi Ike Brown brings back that old time magic for me right down to that siren like Heeeyyyyy whenever he gets into a tight spot. And then there's that fantastic double triple loopy windmill windup he makes when setting up to pitch. Man I could have used that delivery as a Little Leaguer to confound the opposing batters. In both baseball flicks Brown's character winds up on the Chicago Cubs this time by way of Sauk Center. I guess we've all run across someone at one time or another who makes excuses for just about everything but with Frank X. Farrell Brown he just never gives it a rest. Most of the time I had to wonder why too because a lot of the situations on screen were slice of life stuff like buying an engagement ring. I guess Ike was so much into the Alibi persona he just couldn't quit. Speaking of which that was quite the double talk line he threw at the jeweler I don't remember Brown ever using that before.After a false start with his gal Dolly Farrell rises to the occasion on both the ball field and in the romance department. Some of the baseball stuff is just plain silly like calling all the players around to the pitcher's mound while Ike strikes out the side. There's also a brief interlude involving mobsters attempting to get Ike to 'throw' some games but it's done somewhat haphazardly and blows by without much consequence. It's the physical comedy that entertains along with Joe E. Brown's unique facials that make Alibi Ike a fun diversion.";

Boy they could use him now.Along the way we get some very entertaining baseball scenes. Ya gotta Joe E's windmill windup! Ike's romance with Dolly de Havilland takes up a fairly good chunk of the second half and noticeably slows down the movie. I almost lost interest.

Based on a true story the legend of the Invincible Zishe Breitbart played bravely and somewhat charmingly naive by Jouko Ahola the 1997 and 1999 strongest man still is told among the jewish people. A man who accepted his physical strength as the gift of God and thereby felt obliged to define his goal by that call. When he gets hired at a variet in Berlin he finds himself confronted with the Nazis his strange employer Jan Hanussen played by the impressive Tim Roth who wants to sell him off as Siegfried a blond germanic hero who can even lift an elephant. It is obvious that Zishe has to decide whether he wants to deny his identity or rather become a Samson and fight for who he is. A touch of romance is added by the real life concert pianist Anna Gourari who is almost overacting almost resembling a silent movie actress.A very international very special cast.

	schema:reviewBody "Werner Herzog's Invincible tells the story of a Polish blacksmith in Nazi Germany who in his provincial integrity thinks he can protect his people after becoming the star at the Palace of the Occult in Berlin which is overseen by a sinister man who dreams of becoming the Nazis' Minister of the Occult. Much of the movie's uncanny appeal comes from the contrast between the simplemindedly innocent blacksmithcomestrongman and Tim Roth's wicked Hanussen who trickles with studied malice. Standing between them is a young woman under Hanussen's mental force who the strongman loves. The movie is supposedly based on a true story. I can conceive of various ways it could've been told unspectacularly but Herzog has turned it into a movie in which we mostly have no clue what could possibly happen next.The movie has the evocativeness of a German silent film bold in its expressionism and moralistic insistence. Its casting is critical and intuitively right.

	onyx:emotionText "Werner Herzog's Invincible tells the story of a Polish blacksmith in Nazi Germany who in his provincial integrity thinks he can protect his people after becoming the star at the Palace of the Occult in Berlin which is overseen by a sinister man who dreams of becoming the Nazis' Minister of the Occult. Much of the movie's uncanny appeal comes from the contrast between the simplemindedly innocent blacksmithcomestrongman and Tim Roth's wicked Hanussen who trickles with studied malice. Standing between them is a young woman under Hanussen's mental force who the strongman loves. The movie is supposedly based on a true story. I can conceive of various ways it could've been told unspectacularly but Herzog has turned it into a movie in which we mostly have no clue what could possibly happen next.The movie has the evocativeness of a German silent film bold in its expressionism and moralistic insistence. Its casting is critical and intuitively right. Tim Roth is a menacing deceiver posing as a man with extrasensory abilities using hocuspocus and theatrics as he hustles for position within the rising Nazi majority.

Needless to say both of these powerful characters provide the symbolic thrust of Herzog's visionary statement and he presents them as extreme opposites.

Playing to mostly film stars and members of the ascending Nazi party Zishe plays the role of an Aryan strongman. Initially happy to do so the deception and denial of self gradually eats at him as he performs on stage.I may not be the most cineliterate person in the world but I know enough to give any film from Werner Herzog a try to see what happens. With this film I was interested from the very start as it throws up an interesting true story that I had never heard before. It opens well but it only manages to hang together until the middle of the film at which point the direction of the story starts to badly waver and with a mostly amateur cast and some clunky dialogue it cannot do anything to really turn it around. After a while it does become dull and rather aimless which was a shame given the potential that it showed early on. The problems of narrative will probably worry Herzog's fans less than the casual viewer though but what will surprise them is how visually ordinary it all is. It all looks good and has some nice use of locations but generally it lacks imagination or the flair for the unusual with only the outofplace use of the crabs sticking in the mind as an image.The cast are mixed with some good performances and some terrible ones. Ahola falls somewhere in the middle he is not the most expressive man in the world but he has a good presence and his gentle strongman performance works for the majority  it is only in the latter stages where more is asked of him where he comes up wanting. Roth is impressive of course and he does add a much needed professionalism into the film when given the chance. The rest of the cast are mostly average at best  not a major problem but few people will defend the bland and flat deliveries of people like Gourari and Wein  both of whom come over as if they would struggle to read a traffic sign in a convincing manner.Overall this is an OK film at best  starting with potential but fading away long before the end. The performances are mostly average but what is more surprising is that Herzog doesn't really make the film his own  some of it looks interesting but it lacks the visual style that I had hoped for and it doesn't offer a great deal in its place.".

SPOILERS !!!! In a Polish town the circus arrives and blacksmith's son Zishe Brietbart beats the strongman in a competition and impressed with Zishe's physical strength a theater agent signs him up where he performs at Berlin's Cabaret Of The Occult which is owned by Danish nobleman Hanussen . Since it's 1932 the Nazis are on the rise so Hanussen reinvents Zishe as  Siegfried  and shows his predominantly Nazi audience the physical strength of this Ayran . Hanussen shows this as proof of Ayran superiority while at the same time impressing his audience with his own occult powers . However despite his own naked opportunist agenda Hanussen has a secret of his own that he doesn't want known to his audience ...Some people may claim how ridiculously ironic it is having a Jew pretending to be an Ayran strongman in order to put forward a racist agenda but this I feel is the whole point of the story which one has a feeling has been turned into a fable rather than a story that has stuck to rigid facts . Certainly the most bitter irony about the rise of Nazism is that one of the architects of Nazi philosophy Alfred Rosenberg had a Jewish name while Hitler  Heydrich and Eichmann were of Jewish descent themselves  Though technically not Jews  According to tradition if your mother wasn't a Jew neither are you  so people with an irony deficency will have a problem understanding this beautiful and intelligent film And I don't apologise for thinking this is a beautiful and intelligent film  it might not have the reputation of Herzog's other films like the painfully overrated FITZCARRALDO but it's one I can certainly recommend for a mainstream audience . However there is one serious flaw that stands out and that is the casting of Jouko Ahola as Zishe . You do get the gut instinct that Herzog wanted to cast a certain Austrian body builder turned politician in the lead role and it's impossible to watch Ahola without being reminded of Big Arnie except Ahola is an even more wooden actor and his lack of thespian skills is made even more obvious when he's playing opposite Tim Roth is one of his most impressive roles which slightly damages the movie".

	schema:reviewBody "Of the filmmaker Werner Herzog I've heard and read strange things about him and his films. That two of his works Aguirre The Wrath of God and Fitzceraldo are two of the most bizarre modern European films. That he once ate a shoe from a bet with Errol Morris and made a documentary about it. That he once said and I'm paraphrasing some people make movies with their minds and hearts I make them with my expletive. So when I saw this film at the rental store Invincible and the image of Tim Roth in a truly Gothic pose on the cover I expected it to be a dark brooding film about prewar predictator Hitler Germany. In a way it is and in a way its not. Although the film is rated PG13 I would imagine that for the diehard Herzog fans this is like his family film or at the least kids might not be too freaked out to watch it. Surprisingly Herzog brings a fable out of a true story about how each side of the coin is a certain way black or white and whichever role you choose defines you though there can be an exception.There was one sequence however where I saw that Herzog brilliantly had a kind of surreal oneofakind filmed scene that I expected amongst the more typical dramatic scenes. It involves a dream of Zishe's played by near unknown Jouko Ahola in a mostly onenote performance where he walks around on a rocky beach. He is surrounded by bright red crabs and steps around on the rock trying not to knock them down or get snipped by their claws. But he does so casually with the searing Hans ZimmerKlaus Blaudet music in the background. This dream occurs again towards the end of the film as his younger brother leads him by the hand through the crabs on the rocks somehow giving him strength. These are powerful scenes in a movie that could've been even more powerful.Take Tim Roth's performance it towers above all the others because most aside from Udo Kier whom I recognized are nonprofessionals. It's to Herzog's credit that he makes these people in Poland shtetels and in Berlin to be believable but he's not a great director of them like the neorealists in Italy were. And because Roth as this brooding tragic antihero witnesses what happens with his strongman from Poland is so good and subtle at his role he outacts pretty much anyone else in the film. Watching him is fascinating especially when he's quiet and subtle or in the scenes when he's on stage performing his acts. It shows how versatile he can be in this film. I just wish it was the same for the others. strong B".

This dream occurs again towards the end of the film as his younger brother leads him by the hand through the crabs on the rocks somehow giving him strength. These are powerful scenes in a movie that could've been even more powerful.Take Tim Roth's performance it towers above all the others because most aside from Udo Kier whom I recognized are nonprofessionals. It's to Herzog's credit that he makes these people in Poland shtetels and in Berlin to be believable but he's not a great director of them like the neorealists in Italy were. And because Roth as this brooding tragic antihero witnesses what happens with his strongman from Poland is so good and subtle at his role he outacts pretty much anyone else in the film. Watching him is fascinating especially when he's quiet and subtle or in the scenes when he's on stage performing his acts. It shows how versatile he can be in this film. I just wish it was the same for the others. strong B";

	schema:reviewBody "Werner Herzog has always been one of my favorite filmmakers and it was hard to keep up with him when I joined the military so this was the first film of his I have seen in a theater since Fitzcarraldo. I did like this film but its clearly not one of his best. As I watched this film I could not help but think of the other actors Herzog has used in the past and how they could be cast in this film. Of course Tim Roth would have had Klaus Kinski in his role. Eva Mattes would be Marta who's played by Anna Gourari and how many times has Herzog used a non actor in the lead? The cinematography is terrific and the period is beautifully detailed. The music is by Hans Zimmer and he is a legend but his score doesn't evoke the same haunting sounds that Popol Vuh did. I didn't mind the fact that Jouko Ahola as Zishe cannot act. He really isn't suppose to. Herzog is going for a more realistic response to the complexities of what is going on around him. Herzog has done this before with Bruno S. Tim Roth is excellent and I also liked the charm of Anna Gourari. And its always good to see Udo Kier! This film is certainly not up to Aguirre or Nosferatu or Fitzcarraldo but it is better than Kaspar Hauser. Not great but its pure Herzog.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I recently saw Werner Herzog speak at the American Cinematheque he made a comment with apologies that he frequently thought of the fact finding obsessions of most documentary filmmakers as being evidence that they are the accountants of truth. Mr. Herzog INVINCIBLE is a remarkable example of what you should do with reality when you're making a movie about it. Without a righteous attitude or stance which of course is absurdly unnecssary when depicting Nazis as evil Herzog gave us a taste of the Jewish mentality in Eastern Europe just before Hitler came to power. Zisha the strong man is about as normal as people come. His faith is simple but not apparently as strong as his body. His love for his family and tenderness towards others though is the character's strongest and most vital aspect. It's this naturalness beautifully portrayed by this actor which is the reason that he is able to ignore the cynicism of the modern world and come to understand the invisible world of the faith inside him and around him. This movie actually reminds me of St. Augustine's most profound observations to the effect that the age of obvious miracles is past and we are living in the trying period of those who must discover for themselves that the physical world is a testing ground for one's faith a place to develop one's understanding of God's invisible permanence. Back here on earth though I can't help but make two minor criticisms. One is the overacting of the pianist when she's playing Beethoven. The other is the dreadfully staged disbelief of the Polish Jews when Zisha tries to warn them of the coming holocaust. All in all though this film is remarkable  it is lasting evidence that there's an unseen spirit world of which neither churchgoers nor new age money seekers are even dimly aware.".

The movie runs 133' minutes and yet it gives you a feeling that you haven't seen enough it leaves you disappointed a bit but no way you can blame the director... the whole problem stands with the writing... The Screenplay doesn't work it doesn't center on anything concrete but it tries to include all this long story... starting with Breitbart's being discovered in this Poland village after he wrestles this big dude etc etc... then he moves in Berlin after 25 minutes and then the interesting story begins... so by all means Herzog disappoints with this clumsy and not so dimensional screenplay...  Something else that didn't work and everyone can notice it is the acting of Jouko Ahola who plays Zishe Breitbart... his acting is just dull and simply bad it's one of the factors that hurt the movie in general.On the other hand Hans Zimmer score is good he is on his level and that serves as a strong element of the movie.  Herzog as the director does a superb job he does his magic and this serves as the strongest point of the movie to let us carry on...  Also i have to praise Tim Roth who delivers a strong performance even thou he's supporting. No wonder why he has worked with great directors such as Tarantino Haneke Wenders Coppola Allen etc etc.THE VERDICT 710  with a better screenplay and someone else in the leading role these one could've been a real contender.".

Zishe saw the Nazis starting to harm the Jews and he urged the Jews to leave Germany. However no one believed him. In this latter half there are more scenes which makes people think. For example there was a scene which Zishe walked among an island full of red crabs. I think it means that the Jews were like the red crabs they could not escape from the island.In the end Zishe died of an infection caused by a wound in the leg. His death was two days before the Second World War. I think the directors want to carry a secret message here. As Zishe was the hero among the Jewish population in Germany his death means that even the strongest Jew could die. Without Zishe the Jewish population became vulnerable.

	schema:reviewBody "If the name of the director Werner Herzog frightens you into believing that Invincible is a 'difficult' movie I am happy to inform you of the direct opposite It is direct easily digested and tells a straight story based on real people and events. The events are somewhat adjusted for making this into a tighter story about the Jewish strongman Zishe Breitbart and his great career in the NaziBerlin of the 1930's. Zishe is convinced that he is chosen by God to save Judaism from Hitler.I try to keep this text free from so called spoilers giving away the story other than what should be known since I like to experience the storyline for myself and not having it unwittingly told straight up and down. One of recent examples of this is when Matt Drudge gives away the ending of this summers big action adventure in USA 'Planet of the Apes'.Jouko Ahola the MoviestarThis is Jouko Aloha's screen dbut and he plays the central part as the Jewish blacksmith Zishe Breitbart whose enormous strength is 'discovered' by a talents scout during a circus performance. Jouko is not a trained actor but was chosen by the director as solid raw material to be shaped into the part. Not having Jouko 'acting' as the others gives his role as the simple nave man from the polish countryside better reality. We actually see and feel him feeling lost in the big city not being accustomed to playing the role of an entertainer and unwilling to play the social game that all of the others engage in.Jouko possesses an charisma and physical presence seldom seen on screen  with his strength and popularity Zishe could easily sink into the swamp of egoism surrounding him. But he walks undamaged through it all and the further the movie plays the purer his character shines. I am who I am says Zishe. It grows more clear what was meant with the Godgiven gift of his great physical power a strength many times that an ordinary blacksmith could ever need. His conclusion is that he is to be the Modern Samson chosen to save the Jewish community from the catastrophe he sense coming. Will he succeed in persuading his fellow people...?The weights and props used were real and the hardest parts were not the demonstrations of strength.  We only had to shoot the 350 kilo deadlift three or four times Jouko tells in an interview for the Swedish 'filmkonst magasin'.  But the scene where Zishe is reunited with his mother and brother in Berlin took 24 takes to complete... I'm pleased with my acting everyone was very kind and helpful if I had trouble. As for other film projects it depends on what happens with this movie. But I won't be sad if nothing comes out if it.The Pianist and the Hollywood starsThe female leading part also a debut as the pianist Marta assistant to Hanussen is a solid performance by Anna Gourari. Marta is trapped by Hanussen and Zishe becomes the support she needs for her liberation. Anna is considered to be one of our times most talented pianists and thus it is not strange that Beethoven's third concert for piano gets to play a big part.The most famous actor is undoubtedly Tim Roth who actually was latest seen as General Thade in 'Planet of the Apes'. Roth takes wide strides playing his part as the hypnotistclairvoyant Erik Jan Hanussen but not as overthetop as 'Archibald Cunningham' in 'Rob Roy'  if such a thing is possible I don't know. Giving Hanussen megalomania colossal arrogance and selfsecureness is quite right since it was this noholesbarredattitude that led the real Hanussen to the great success he had a the 'Leader of the Occult'.Through his career as soothsayer Hanussen became richer and more powerful than most people can dream of. At the peak his show in Berlin was constantly sold out and he had rich bankers movie stars and politicians of NaziGermany following his advice one if which was voting for Hitler. With his close connections to highranking party officials he could at an sance 'predict' the fire who was to destroy the German House of Parliament. The burning of the Reichstag is considered to be a planned act a part of the plan limiting civil rights. Freedom of Press amongst other things was abolished the day after the fire.Udo Kier a well known face for most got his part as Count Helldorf especially written for him by the director. Udo would give the most degenerate character outlandish style  which is also done here in a most telling scene where the directors message in words is most clear.".

We actually see and feel him feeling lost in the big city not being accustomed to playing the role of an entertainer and unwilling to play the social game that all of the others engage in.Jouko possesses an charisma and physical presence seldom seen on screen  with his strength and popularity Zishe could easily sink into the swamp of egoism surrounding him. But he walks undamaged through it all and the further the movie plays the purer his character shines. I am who I am says Zishe. It grows more clear what was meant with the Godgiven gift of his great physical power a strength many times that an ordinary blacksmith could ever need. His conclusion is that he is to be the Modern Samson chosen to save the Jewish community from the catastrophe he sense coming. Will he succeed in persuading his fellow people...?The weights and props used were real and the hardest parts were not the demonstrations of strength.  We only had to shoot the 350 kilo deadlift three or four times Jouko tells in an interview for the Swedish 'filmkonst magasin'.  But the scene where Zishe is reunited with his mother and brother in Berlin took 24 takes to complete... I'm pleased with my acting everyone was very kind and helpful if I had trouble. As for other film projects it depends on what happens with this movie. But I won't be sad if nothing comes out if it.The Pianist and the Hollywood starsThe female leading part also a debut as the pianist Marta assistant to Hanussen is a solid performance by Anna Gourari. Marta is trapped by Hanussen and Zishe becomes the support she needs for her liberation. Anna is considered to be one of our times most talented pianists and thus it is not strange that Beethoven's third concert for piano gets to play a big part.The most famous actor is undoubtedly Tim Roth who actually was latest seen as General Thade in 'Planet of the Apes'. Roth takes wide strides playing his part as the hypnotistclairvoyant Erik Jan Hanussen but not as overthetop as 'Archibald Cunningham' in 'Rob Roy'  if such a thing is possible I don't know. Giving Hanussen megalomania colossal arrogance and selfsecureness is quite right since it was this noholesbarredattitude that led the real Hanussen to the great success he had a the 'Leader of the Occult'.Through his career as soothsayer Hanussen became richer and more powerful than most people can dream of. At the peak his show in Berlin was constantly sold out and he had rich bankers movie stars and politicians of NaziGermany following his advice one if which was voting for Hitler. With his close connections to highranking party officials he could at an sance 'predict' the fire who was to destroy the German House of Parliament. The burning of the Reichstag is considered to be a planned act a part of the plan limiting civil rights. Freedom of Press amongst other things was abolished the day after the fire.Udo Kier a well known face for most got his part as Count Helldorf especially written for him by the director. Udo would give the most degenerate character outlandish style  which is also done here in a most telling scene where the directors message in words is most clear.";

Let me explain...the film purports to be about a Jew who managed to thrive in preWWII Berlin despite the strong climate of antisemitism. It shows Breitbart arriving in the city from Poland JUST BEFORE the Nazis came to power in 1933. And in the epilogue the film states that Breitbart died JUST before this Nazi takeover. However Breitbard died in 1925when the Nazis were an insignificant force in Germanyparticularly in areas outside Bavaria. There was no cabaret filled with jackbooted Nazis watching him perform and it is highly doubtful that Breitbart returned to Poland to warn them of the pending Nazi menace. And he did NOT die in Poland but in Germany.The bottom line is that the film is all about the Nazis and antisemitism. But this just wasn't the case and sadly tends to diminish Breitbart's life.

	schema:reviewBody "There are two very interesting stories struggling to get out of this long weirdly subdued and studiously undramatic movie. Unfortunately neither of them manage to break free.Based on a true story Invincible tells the tale of Zishe Breitbart Jouko Ahola a young Polish Jew who leaves his hometown in 1932 to become a strongman on the stage in Berlin Germany. Lured to Berlin by dreams of the world and a mysterious woman Zishe becomes a star attraction at a club called the Palace of the Occult. There he meets Hanussen Tim Roth the owner of the club and what we would today call a mentalist. He performs feats of hypnosis clairvoyance and mind reading for his Nazifilled audience. Zishe also meets Marta Anna Grouari a young piano player who is married to Hanussen and silently suffers under his mistreatment. At first Hannusen forces his gigantic Jew to portray an Aryan superman thrilling his supposed German brothers with his example of physical greatness. But Zishe eventually throws off that facade and enrages the Nazis who believe no Jew could or should be that strong. Zishe's example inspires Berlin's Jewish community and the show becomes more popular than ever. Zishe comes to tire of Berlin life and after a decidedly nonexplosive confrontation with Hannusen he returns to Poland and desperately tries to warn his fellow Jews about the threat he sees coming from Germany. The strongman isn't much of a speaker however and finds it hard to convince anyone but his little brother Benjamin Jacob Wein.If Invincible had either focused more strongly on the German preoccupation with the occult or on Zishe's struggle to spread a warning about Nazism when he returned to Poland this might have been a very good movie. I t doesn't do nearly enough with either though and wallows in a wholesome boring stupor. This is one case where a film based on a true story would have been far better off taking a few liberties with the facts to construct a firmer more dynamic narrative. Invincible is less a work of entertainment and more an educational film you'd show kids in Hebrew school and I bet they'd find it as tedious as I did.The fascination with the occult of the Nazis and German society as a whole is an aspect of preWWII Germany that hasn't gotten a lot of serious attention in drama. Outside of the outlandish take seen in Hellboy and the find the magical MacGuffin elements of the first and third Indiana Jones movies this is a rare aspect of the Nazis that hasn't been done to death. And Invincible does something quite intriguing with it. It weaves the personal story of Hanussen trying to exploit Nazi superstition for his own benefit into a look at why the occult became such an object of interest in prewar Germany. The film suggests that Germans still suffering from the aftermath of WWI saw the supernatural as a way of recapturing the greatness they thought they had lost. After military defeat economic ruin and political impotency the supposedly mystical powers of someone like Hanussen were a dark beacon drawing in Germans who had lost their faith in the real world. Unfortunately the movie doesn't spend enough time with Roth and the Nazis to get any further into the subject than I have in this review.The story of Zishe returning to Poland and desperately trying to convey the real menace of the Nazis to his disbelieving fellow Jews could also have made for one heck of a movie. But Invincible spends about 5 minutes on that before moving on. What could have been a poignant struggle against skepticism that the Nazis could really be that bad and with Zishe's own inarticulateness is dispensed with in a cursory fashion. Imagine if all the killings at the end of The Godfather happened off screen and were only referred to by other characters and that's sort of how it feels in this film.Poor storytelling choices aside Invincible probably never had a chance to be any good once Jouko Ahola was cast as Zishe. Now the role is that of a huge muscle man so it's not like Tim Roth could have played the part. But Ahola is distractingly terrible. His performance would get him laughed off the stage during a high school play. He makes Dolph Lundgren look like a master thespian. Not only can't he act Ahola has absolutely no screen presence at all. I don't know how drunk writerdirector Werner Herzog was when he decided to use someone this talentless and flat as his main character but I'd bet that instead of measuring the level of alcohol in his blood you'd have to measure the level of blood in his alcohol.This movie has to be remade. There's simply too much about the basic story that's obviously captivating to allow it to remain stuck in this wellintentioned but unfocused and illconsidered trial of a film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm still relatively new to the wealth of Werner Herzog's work and only recently did I learn about him eating a shoe in relation to the inspiring Errol Morris. I was introduced to Herzog via Popol Vuh. Florian Fricke RIP!I get the sense that Herzog prides himself on being anachronistic and this film feels like it could have been made long ago maybe even before the preHolocaust times it focuses on. Some of the shots and the faces especially those in the altercation in the tavern are from another time.I must say as the film started out in the Jewish village I found myself hoping it would confine itself to the dramas of that smaller setting rather than the theater that became the second World War. Also in full disclosure I must say that I saw this the night after being up all evening at work and as such did struggle with nodding off at times.But the fault there is strictly mine...the pacing is slow but it works well. Life then should not have had the flavor of jumpcut hyperspace. I even reviewed certain scenes the day after. I think Herzog also has a fondness for the unknown. While some of the reviewers here may have heard of Zishe Breitbart beforehand I did not. Most of the actors here save two are also unknowns. And as the film unfolds I never remotely felt that the story was easily derived. It would not surprise me if it were unknown to Herzog when he started shooting.Indeed now as I reflect back on it I'm not sure that I can with certainty pronounce what it was about. But I'm going to try now so if you have not seen the film read on only at your own peril.SPOILERSI could see a case made for the nature of the invincible being embodied by the mind of Benjamin as opposed to the physique of Zishe. The final scene of Benjamin soaring signifies that right? It was also interesting to me that the undoing of Zishe comes not in mortal combat against his enemies but in an act of vanity amongst his brethren. Wounded by his pride as much as in his thigh.Tim Roth's character and his portrayal thereof were mesmerizing for me. While I could see the notion of him as a selfloathing being I think his Hanussen is more complicated than that...more selfish than selfhating? Selfpreserving but of course ultimately shortsighted.As for Roth's English accent and other issues with dialects... First I should say that as a native English speaker I feel spoiled by this...but subtitles are just not the same. Secondly I think the mixandmatch accents coupled with the fact that I was not familiar with the real story helped me immensely to take this as a filmic fable by itself.But unlike most fables that have a moral that strikes you with an anvil Invincible stung me like a jellyfish. What a great shot that was by way of the Monterey Aquarium. And the army of crabs that the brothers tiptoe over is that meant to indicate the prevalence of Nazi's...and despite their smallness they make it impossible for an individual to move? Then the train is that the progress of industrial society smashing them?Ultimately I'm left with memorable images circus dog shot! and an underlying story but not enough message to give this too high a ranking. Maybe you had to be one of the 36 in a generation to enjoy this film to its utmost. That's an aspect of Judaism I had never heard before and like most religious dogma it spurs on a visceral antireaction in me. My worship of Herzog however I suspect will grow. I've got Stoczek to see soon. For me even the Invincible was flawed...610".

It would not surprise me if it were unknown to Herzog when he started shooting.Indeed now as I reflect back on it I'm not sure that I can with certainty pronounce what it was about. But I'm going to try now so if you have not seen the film read on only at your own peril.SPOILERSI could see a case made for the nature of the invincible being embodied by the mind of Benjamin as opposed to the physique of Zishe. The final scene of Benjamin soaring signifies that right? It was also interesting to me that the undoing of Zishe comes not in mortal combat against his enemies but in an act of vanity amongst his brethren. Wounded by his pride as much as in his thigh.Tim Roth's character and his portrayal thereof were mesmerizing for me. While I could see the notion of him as a selfloathing being I think his Hanussen is more complicated than that...more selfish than selfhating? Selfpreserving but of course ultimately shortsighted.As for Roth's English accent and other issues with dialects... First I should say that as a native English speaker I feel spoiled by this...but subtitles are just not the same. Secondly I think the mixandmatch accents coupled with the fact that I was not familiar with the real story helped me immensely to take this as a filmic fable by itself.But unlike most fables that have a moral that strikes you with an anvil Invincible stung me like a jellyfish. What a great shot that was by way of the Monterey Aquarium. And the army of crabs that the brothers tiptoe over is that meant to indicate the prevalence of Nazi's...and despite their smallness they make it impossible for an individual to move? Then the train is that the progress of industrial society smashing them?Ultimately I'm left with memorable images circus dog shot! and an underlying story but not enough message to give this too high a ranking. Maybe you had to be one of the 36 in a generation to enjoy this film to its utmost. That's an aspect of Judaism I had never heard before and like most religious dogma it spurs on a visceral antireaction in me. My worship of Herzog however I suspect will grow. I've got Stoczek to see soon. For me even the Invincible was flawed...610";

Sometimes it works really well. This one works somewhat. I really like Jouko Ahola. Despite his size he has a gentle innocent demeanor. He is perfect for the role. Tim Roth is mercurial. The style of the movie lacks the needed tension. It's simply not exciting and the excessive running time of over two hours really drags out the story.

One can understand why Jouko Ahola was cast as the strongman having actually won that title in reality twice 2  4 yrs before the movie was made though he isn't by any means a great actor but let's not forget that neither was Arnold Schwarzenegger much of an actor in his early movies either but look at him now!!! The movie covers a lot of ground such as antisemitism greed naively and self awakening but rather superficially including a rather lame attempt at romance.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface a documentary about a football match between Tibet and Greenland doesn't sound like much. But when you remember that Tibet is unrecognised as a sovereign nation by 180 countries around the globe the film begins to take on another significance. The Tibetan government in exile based in northern India has campaigned for the plight of the Tibetan people to be recognised since 1959. This campaign has fallen on mostly deaf ears. In what may be called a desperate attempt to make the general public listen several Danish football enthusiasts launched a campaign to organise and train a Tibetan national team and bring them to Denmark for a match against Greenland  a country only semiautonomous from Denmark but which possesses its own national team. This documentary focuses on the training of the team in India and the political debate in Denmark leading up to the match. The Chinese government threatened sanctions against both Denmark and Greenland if the game was played and FIFA refused to recognise the match. Tibetan players from all over Europe were denied visas to join the team in Denmark as their host countries feared reprisals and fines from FIFA. A simple game of football became an international political event. The film focuses mainly on the players of the Tibetan team. Not their lives or any discussion of how difficult things are for them and hardly any mention of TibetanChinese relations. Instead the film makers chose to record the emotional impact of what was most likely the most monumental occasion of their lives. This documentary achieves its goal illuminating governmental hypocrisy with something akin to peaceful non violent protest  the hallmark of the Tibetan resistance  in the form of a football match. Technically the film is sound documentary work. There are no experiments no unusual techniques just straightforward reporting. Given the sensitivity of the subject this impersonal technique seems appropriate.".

The director is Stefan Ruzowitzky and he is also one of the writers who worked on adapting this modern piece of successful children's literature. If you take a look at the filmmaker's other stuff not just the Oscarwinning Revanche you will find films that are pretty dark pretty creepy at times even so this family comedy is actually not exactly what you would expect from him. However it also shows how popular children's films were back then here in Germany still are today. This is also proved by the fact that the cast list is actually quite prominent. The voice actors include many names that are pretty familiar and known here in Germany. I will spare you the names so you can check out the cast list for yourself. One interesting addition though is Pilar Bardem even if she does not have too much screen time outside the first 10 minutes and yes she is Javier Bardem's mother and the one he thanked so graciously in his Oscar acceptance speech.This is the story of a girl who gets picked as the successor to the powers of a mighty good witch. A little dragon voiced by comedian Michael Mittermeier who did a pretty good job here is out to talk to her and introduce her to the world of sorcery. At the same time we are introduced to her family her school mates her teachers etc. This is really pretty much what you could expect and maybe even hope for if you hear about a German fantasy film about a little witch. It is a nice mix of normal life and life as a witch. There is no real depth to it but that's okay. The fantastic references still keep audiences interested. At times it was difficult to see that Naujoks' clumsy antagonist character is really so smart and powerful to achieve what he achieves in this film even if it is just temporary. Talking about temporary the temporary transformation scene early on with Catterfeld playing a pretty hilarious role was one of the best of the entire film. By the way in the second half it also reminded me a bit of Momo with the gray colors everywhere. As a whole this is a film that got slightly worse in the second 40 minutes but it's all good. I'd still call it an enjoyable outcome. Go see it if you can. I will certainly check out the sequel at some point too and I hope it is just as good.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Greatest Show on Earth is a Cecil B. DeMille extravaganza maybe the best one he ever produced and directed. Unlike his religious films or his historical films this film is a nice tribute to an American institution the Ringling BrothersBarnumBailey Circus and as such it does not attract the controversy of some of his other films.The Best Picture Oscar for 1952 that this film won was more of a tribute to a Hollywood institution. Cecil B. DeMille in fact directed the first Hollywood made film The Squaw Man forty years earlier and this Oscar was essentially a tribute to him for the work of a lifetime. Not the first time or the last time the Motion Picture Academy has done that.This is DeMille spectacle at it's best. The circus as a cinema subject so full of color and life is ideal for a DeMille production. Wonderful camera work marks this film both of the circus acts and the reaction shots into the crowd of the children of all ages.Cecil B. DeMille himself narrates portions of the film showing the work involved in putting on the Greatest Show on Earth. His was a familiar voice to the American public because for 10 years DeMille came into American households via radio narrating the Lux Radio Theater. In fact until Alfred Hitchcock got his own anthology TV series DeMille's voice was probably the most known to the American public of a film director.And only his name and that of Walt Disney's of people behind the camera were guaranteed box office in the days of the Hollywood studio system.Spectacle was his thing and DeMille was the master. As a director of players and a judge of good modern writing DeMille left a lot to be desired. Because of the nature of the subject no great historical or religious events the grandiloquent dialog present in so many DeMille films is kept to a minimum here.This was Charlton Heston's first big break as a star and his second film under a Paramount contract. He had done a film called Dark City a good noir thriller that got good reviews but did little for him personally. DeMille saw the six foot two Heston walking on the Paramount lot one day and just said to himself that this was to be the circus ramrod for this film.But Heston was fourth billed behind Betty Hutton Cornel Wilde and Gloria Grahame all better known than him at the time. Wilde and Grahame were independents as was James Stewart who played a clown with a hidden past.Stewart in fact had always wanted to play a clown and took this supporting role with smaller billing just for the opportunity. At the time he agreed to do this his wife Gloria was pregnant with their twin daughters. Stewart had it in his contract a clause that gave him permission to leave the film temporarily to be with Gloria when her time was near. In fact Gloria McLean Stewart had a rough time with the birth and Jimmy exercised that option and totally enraged DeMille who had to shut down production for a few days. He and DeMille did not get along after that though Stewart finished the film and was great in it.Gloria Grahame may not have been the most beautiful woman in Hollywood but she was the most seductive operating in 1952. That was a banner year for her. She got a Best Supporting Actress for The Bad and the Beautiful on top of this DeMille film. As the elephant girl she attracts the unwanted attentions of Lyle Bettger who plays an elephant trainer.Bettger was a great player at that time who played a lovely variety of psychopaths on the screen. He pulls out all the stops here and its his unwanted attentions to Grahame that set up the final scenes.Dorothy Lamour was here also in a supporting part and she gets to sing Lovely Luawanna Lady in sarong and the reaction shots of the crowd focus on a couple of familiar faces who panted after her in a few Paramount films.The story itself is a standard four sided triangle involving Heston Hutton Wilde and Grahame with Bettger horning in. You have to see the film to find out who winds up with who.However the high point of the film involves a circus train wreck. DeMille got a lot of notice for wrecking a train in Union Pacific back in 1939. So he doubles the excitement and wrecks two trains here with circus animals pouring out of busted cages. Great stuff.Betty Hutton was coming close to the end of her film career. This and Annie Get Your Gun would be her biggest triumphs. Given DeMille's limitations on directing players Hutton is surprisingly subdued here and effective. She also sings a couple of nice songs here as she bids adieu to Paramount in her next to last film for them.When The Greatest Show on Earth came out and was doing great box office Charlton Heston related a story that DeMille came over to him on the Paramount lot and gave him a newspaper clipping and said he would never get a better notice ever no matter how long a career he had. Heston read the thing and the critic from some small town paper praised all the actors like Stewart Wilde Hutton Grahame and Lamour said they were great but that C.B. DeMille must be the greatest director in the world to get a performance out of that circus ramrod.For all of DeMille's faults here he created a circus picture that set the standard for any to follow.".

It was a big picture it had a great story it gave a lot of bang for the buck and that has always been a factor in grabbing the Oscar. It does seem a bit dated to us now used to high flying special effects different acting styles and quick cut editing instead of letting the scene play out as it so often does here but it's such a great story. The circus itself is a character and the way Demille used the audience to make them seem so individual is wonderful. And I'm not just referring to the HopeCrosby cameo. Remember the fat guy with the kid scarfing down the ice cream laughing his head off while the kid looked confused? You could tell he was reliving his childhood and he became EveryMan to us with only seconds of screen time. That's mastery. The integration of the real circus people with the actors was seamless and if nothing else this movie captures a time when the circus was really a circus. Carp all you want guys. But I think you may be too spoiled by ultra realism to appreciate the subtler gems in this very respectable film.".

While you realize that they  have a net just under the view of the camera they both perform physically demanding stunts with the camers right in their faces!  I can't stand on my head on the floor much less on a swinging trapeze!!Wilde's front summersault from one swinging bar to another swinging bar is breathtaking!!Some of the action is quite dated and the trainwreck is...well DeMille's rendition of a massive trainwreck.  The plot creaks a bit here and there but the many performers do their bits with conviction.Hutton and Wilde steal the show from Heston and Stewart.  I recommend this film to Circus lovers everywhere and to people who appreaciate actors placing themselves in Harms Way to create illusions be they VERY dangerous illusions of the REAL thing!

	schema:reviewBody "It would validate this film best if I state outright at this point that I am a great fan of the movie SINGIN' IN THE RAIN also released in 1952 and generally ignored by the Academy seemingly due to the shower of accolades handed out to AN AMERICAN IN PARIS. THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH did not win many Oscars beyond the coveted best picture award but even this fact has poisoned my viewpoint of the justification of the Academy's decision and that this in itself displays the incomprehensible factor that the statuette ended up at Paramount not MGM. However my eventual purpose of viewing this film was threefold to see Jimmy Stewart Dorothy Lamour and one of the final best pictures of the 1950s which I had not seen. All my SINGIN' IN THE RAIN prejudices aside I was very pleasantly surprised.Cecil B. DeMille's opinions of the circus as a human machine made up of many parts' is interesting as it evokes the assemblage of any motion picture and certainly an enormous production such as this one. The script generally convincing in its theme can deliver on its expectations and bring to life a dramacomedyepicactionromancemusical that actually works all elements and subplots played alongside. Even if these aspects make for melodramatic story lines I have assumed that the purpose of the film is generally basic entertainment. And the basic storythe dramatic lives of circus performers culminating and reaching their peak underneath the glamour and colour of the big top isn't too bad either. DeMille's wellhandled direction is intriguing and always expectantly a job well done.There are many good examples of an allstar ensemble cast but this one ranks close to the topBetty Hutton Cornel Wilde Charlton Heston Jimmy Stewart Dottie Lamour Gloria Grahameeach may bear no resemblance to their character's personalities but play their parts interestingly well. Generally I found Stewart's portrayal as Buttons the clown masked behind a multiple personality to be the best performance in the film. It is difficult also not to mention the many great and entertaining reallife circus performers that truly made up the spirit of THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH and continue to do so in their differed entertaining medium today so it is really quite a nice tribute to their dedication.To satisfy the varied genres of the film each character is where they are to fuel the particular element. Angel Grahame enhances the comedy with her natural talents and Phyllis Lamour and Holly Hutton to fill out the musical aspects with an extensive musical program including Jumpin' Jack' and the title song. Romance is demonstrated in a series of different love triangles involving five of the six lead characters. Drama is seen with the integration of all these aspects involving Buttons Stewart tension between Sebastian Wilde and Brad Heston and the case of post ANNIE GET YOUR GUN competitive oneupmanship between Holly and Sebastian on the trapezes. Finally in the case of action the sensationalism of the train scene brings all these emotions to a haltto create one of the biggest epics of 1950s Hollywood and to destroy some of the colourful and glamourous illusions of circus life.Despite the fact the film definitely exceeded my original expectations of it and the fact that it filled its threehour plus running time certainly impressed me. However I would like to continue to retain my position on the unfair juxtaposition of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and it is doubtful my opinion will swing to favour THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH any time soon.Rating 810".

	schema:reviewBody "In making preparations to shoot The Greatest Show on Earth producerdirector Cecil B. DeMille had certainly done his research by soaking up a great deal of the circus atmosphere while touring with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum  Bailey. The finished product is probably the grandest circus picture ever made with a great cast including Betty Hutton Cornel Wilde Charlton Heston Dorothy Lamour Gloria Grahame and my favorite actor James Stewart. On the other side of that coin for all the fine leading cast members the numerous circus acts most of which are wellexecuted the love triangles and the general danger and excitement that goes along with circus life this twoandahalfhour picture tends to bog down at times. Adding to this is the somewhat tiresome voiceover narration by DeMille himself. Don't read the next couple of paragraphs if you have not yet seen this picture. James Stewart must have had tons of fun in his portrayal of Buttons the clown. He apparently had always wanted to play a clown and relished the opportunity to work with one of the most famous of all circus clowns Emmett Kelly. Buttons puts on a brief sideshow for the spectators as he lets various objects e.g. flowers fuzzy spheres and lengthy strings pop into the air. He also sings a duet with Holly Hutton entitled Be a Jumping Jack as they bounce together on a trampoline. But his most crucial moment in the film which makes me feel sorry for the poor clown comes when he reveals himself as a doctor wanted for the mercy killing of his wife. Before he gets hauled off by a detective Henry Wilcoxon the softspoken lovable kind Buttons saves the life of the tough nononsense circus boss Brad a perfect role for Heston by giving him a blood transfusion.Here are some other highlights from this picture. The train wreck caused by the insanely jealous elephant trainer Klaus Lyle Bettger is absolutely frightening. The initial trapeze duel between rival aerialists Holly and Sebastian Wilde keeps the spectators on the edge of their seats. Brad physically banishes a crooked Midway operator John Kellogg off the premises. An elephant's trunk snatches Holly away from Sebastian. And the lovely Phyllis Lamour sings a nice rendition of Lovely Luawana Lady. To summarize The Greatest Show on Earth had so much effort put into it it won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1952 and yet it sometimes appears to drag. But don't allow that to stop you from enjoying the good points of the movie particularly the excitement and risk involved with being a part of the circus. Cecil B. DeMille had fulfilled his dream of bringing the Ringling Bros. and Barnum  Bailey Circus to the big screen and The Greatest Show on Earth pulls out all the stops.".

One of the more interesting aspects of this is Emmett Kelly one of America's greatest clowns who appears throughout the film as himself.THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH is lots of flash and dazzle a little song and dance Charleton Heston in his first major role Betty Hutton in one of her final films she did most of her own stunt work and lots of corny charm.

	schema:reviewBody "I am entirely unfamiliar with Cecille B. DeMille's work or even what the public reaction was to his career although I've heard a few negative things and I've heard a lot more negative things about this picture's Best Oscar win since it won over such AFI top 100 entries as High Noon and A Place in the Sun.The film is somewhat metacinematic It brings the joys of the circus to the viewer in the same way that it does for the audience in the film. With authentic circus acts thrown into the mix these scenes are very exciting. But the film extends beyond just bringing footage of the circus to a movie audience as it effectively captures the drama backstage and brings you into a unique world.The film is slightly more spectacle than story in the sense that it sometimes feel like the story is secondary to the lions tigers and other circus acts. The plot bobbles through multiple story lines but mainly centers around circus manager Brad Charlton Heston trapeze primadonna Holly not much of a circus name I know and a womanizing Frenchman named Sebastian who becomes the circus' new headline trapeze artists and hopes to steal the heart of the woman she stole the spotlight from. Also featuring heavily into the story are Angel Gloria Grahame a past flame of Sebastian Klauss an elephant tamer with an obsessive desire for Angel and Jimmy Stewart as a wise old clown who has been hiding a couple of secrets.Among the cast Heston Grahame and Stewart really stick out for excellent performances. Heston's circus manager is a man of very strong character who you come to empathize with because he's got the careers of thousands of people on his backs and is willing to sacrifice his personal relationships his health and his ego when dealing with cocky people like Sebastian to see to it that the show is a success. Gloria Grahame brings such wit and sass to oneline jabs and insults that it makes a convincing character out of what would otherwise have been a twonote shill. Lastly Stewart is classic Stewart but he delivers that Midwestern persona underneath a veneer of makeup and in a supporting role.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a circus buff I can't imagine anybody BUT Cecil B. De Mille having the scope of vision to do justice to a show deliberately created to be so big that one person simply can't take it all in and the stories and subplots that abound under the biggest of the Big Tops. That said I do have to wonder what on earth the Academy was thinking when they voted TGSOE the Oscar as Best Picture of 1952.That year saw the release of High Noon Ivanhoe The Quiet Man and Singin' In The Rain any one of which could lay better claim to the title of Best Picture in terms of writing plot and cinematography. Why did TGSOE win the Oscar? I believe it is because the film was seen as a last chance vote for De Mille particularly ironic given that C.B. received the Thalberg that year for creating and producing consistently highquality movies. De Mille's best work was decades behind him when he filmed the 1951 edition of the Ringling Brothers  Barnum  Bailey Circus. The subplots purple prose and some of the situations have more in common with the silent cinema spectacles for which De Mille is justly famed than they do with the realities of running a threering railroad circus plus midway under canvas on the road for an 8month season.One subplot almost derailed the production in fact. From its beginnings Ringling Brothers was renowned for running a totally honest show. Considering that at one point Ringling had been nicknamed 'the SundaySchool Show' for its total intolerance of grifters pickpockets and thieves the subplot involving a crime boss planting a team of con men on the show to run the midway's games of chance was about as welcome to the circus's management as a skunk at a picnic. There were rows between De Mille Art Concello Ringling's Director of Performance and John Ringling North the show's owner over this subplot until C.B. convinced them he needed that plot line to set up the climactic train wreck at the end of the movie. Ringling's management didn't like THAT much either because RBBB hadn't had a train wreck since 1892! However Ringling Brothers extended itself beyond their usual standards to accommodate the filming. Concello a famous aerialist in his time even gaffed The Great Sebastian's fall for De Mille. Despite the tensions engendered by the needs of two different forms of entertainment there is a circus legend that De Mille got a royal chewingout from Concello for moving the lighting around without asking so he could film better thus nearly causing a trapeze artist to fall because he couldn't see his catcher the principal photography is a marvelous chronicle of circus life in and out of the ring. The photography in fact is what makes The Greatest Show On Earth such an important picture. De Mille succeeded in capturing on film a way of life that even then was starting to die John Ringling North would strike the Big Top for good midway through the 1956 season and convert his circus into an 'arena show.' Forget the corny subplots involving Brad Braden Angel Holly Buttons the Clown Klaus the elephant trainer and The Great Sebastian. Watch this movie in a documentary frame of mind and you will realize not just how important the circus used to be back before television brought the world into your living room but the sense of wonder that has been lost from our fasterpaced widerranging lives. Glory in the music as well much of it written either for the movie or the 1951 Edition. Victor Young's The Greatest Show On Earth March instantly sets the circus scene just as well as Fucik's Entry of the Gladiators ever has. Remember that all those acts are doing their thing in real time not with the help of a green screen and CGI. Those are real people really risking their necks out there! Oh yes and that really IS Betty Hutton working on the single bar above Ring One. She was doubled for the sequences on the flying trapeze but she learned and performed her own routines on the single bar. There is an extant film clip of her being presented with an award from Photoplay Magazine by C.B. De Mille who had to ride up on a camera crane to give it to her while she was rehearsing under the Big Top. We owe the great Cecil B. De Mille many thanks for documenting The Greatest Show On Earth at its peak. I personally believe this movie should rank high on the AFI 100 Greatest Movies List. However as I've said the best picture of 1952 it isn't not by a long shot.Even so buy the DVD and go to the circus again... and again... and again! Bring the young 'uns! Bring the old folks! Come again!".

Cecil was a man of tremendous persona with a hunger for showcasing spectacle by means of careful intense and thorough research. He achieves amazing success in portraying to the best of his ability of the times the most realistic circus acts without the use of raw footage and covering the stories behind the characters involved. The thing that really moves everything along though is the musical score. Two words on that GOOD GOD!!! The music will make you want to go to the circus even if you didn't like this picture. For those of you who didn't like this picture why not go to the circus instead? You may be entertained to the point that you'll end up silencing your bad reviews. I'm not saying you have top like this picture but if you haven't seen it yet and it's because of the certain bad reviews it got from some people you're really going to miss something.".

This hugely agreeable film is a faithful reflection of the title . This is tone of the best Cecil B. De Mille here in all his epic glory  he is the great director of the greatness. It has a fantastic scenario great mass movement and even spectacular scenes for the time as a car driving toward a train on the railroad tracks and subsequently crash. The story is fine  wrought with romance  love stories  and impressive scenes with enormous pedigree. The film is a melodramatic and romantic tale with the classic triangular love story between HestonHuttonWilde and meshing drama with events offstage along with some scenes in documentary style . The movie is wrought with romance and glamour but is a simple  and also contains an intriguing story about a doctor pursued by the justice . It packs some patently faked ones with players in front of obvious blue real projection. This colorful and dramatic flick packs amazing shows and exciting final . Extraordinary cast and good performances  especially from Charlton Heston and James Stewart as likable clown  both of whom are top notch under Cecil B De Mille's correct direction . Furthermore  some scenes the actors perform their own stunts . Some surprising gueststar cameos as Bob Hope  Bing Crosby watching their usual partenaire  Dorothy Lamour .

	schema:headline " An entertaining picture just not the Best Picture";
	schema:reviewBody "The Greatest Show on Earth is a good movie and it's entertaining enough it's just not an Oscarwinning caliber movie. As other reviewers have noted this film was probably given its Best Picture Oscar as a kind of lifetime achievement award to Cecil B. DeMille. It wasn't that the Academy felt that they had unjustly snubbed DeMille in the past for any specific film it was just that he had always made those kind of epic castofthousands types of pictures that drew in the audiences but that rarely won Oscars. Plus a large body of DeMille's work had been done before the Academy Awards even came into existence in 1927. The whole thing seems especially unjust when you look at the competition that year. Two of the other nominees  High Noon and The Quiet Man are considered unique and classic to this day. Also there is a film in the top 10 of AFI Best Films from that year that didn't even get nominated for best picture  Singin' in the Rain  which is arguably the best musical film ever made. It's rather ironic that just four years later the Academy could have probably awarded DeMille more legitimately when he made his last movie the epic The Ten Commandments in 1956.This movie is basically a documentary on how the Ringling Brothers circus operated in the early 50's and large chunks of film are taken up showing how the Big Top was assembled the manual labor involved how the entire circus  including wild animals  was transported via rail and basically just all of the hard work that went on behind the scenes. There is also a pretty spectacular scene near the end of the film involving the two trains as they are transporting the circus from one town to another. I say was because the circus as it is portrayed in this movie closed down and ceased to exist in 1956. The truth is that the Ringling Brothers circus never fully recovered financially from the double whammy of the Great Depression and a fatal fire that killed over 100 people in Hartford Connecticut in 1944 and thus was in the process of failing even when this movie was made. The plot of the movie is very thin the main thread being an uninspired love triangle involving the two stars of the trapeze act Holly and the Great Sebastion played by Betty Hutton and Cornel Wilde respectively and the managing boss of the traveling show Brad Braden played by Charleton Heston. The subplots include an elephant trainer who is obsessed over a girl in the show who doesn't care for him some smalltime mobsters whose crooked games get thrown off the lot by Brad and Buttons the clown played by Jimmy Stewart who never takes off his makeup and who seems to have a mysterious past. All of these plot lines are just there to hold the documentary part of the film together and also as a backdrop for all of the circus acts that are numerous and quite spectacular to behold especially the acrobatic acts. Quite honestly onefourth into the movie you can see the outcome of the dramatic portion of the movie coming at you from a mile away. This makes the fact that this movie won Best Motion Picture Screenplay an even odder decision than the Best Picture award.There is some interesting trivia involving the film. Famous clown Emmett Kelly can be seen at one point in the film without makeup  a fact that Mr. Kelly was not happy about. Also Dorothy Lamour has a supporting role in this film and during one of her musical performances in the show the camera pans to the audience as it often does in this film  but this time you get a brief glimpse of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope enjoying the show. The inside joke here is that Lamour Crosby and Hope were the costars of the popular series of Road to ... movies of the 40's and 50's.".

However don't conclude from that that this is a bad movie. In fact it is a very good movie.At the end of the day The Greatest Show on Earth succeeds primarily because it's good entertainment. Cecil B. DeMille knew how to do spectacle and there is plenty here to please the senses fun songs and costumes abound and the circus tricks bear up even by today's standards.The film's many solid casting choices don't hurt either. Charlton Heston is perfect as the brusque workaholic circus manager succeeding in remaining likable and sympathetic. Betty Hutton tackles the extremely difficult task of being girlish enthusiastic and breezy without being annoying. Both Hutton and Gloria Grahame provide some good drama and are thoroughly convincing as circus performers. Dorothy Lamour provides some nice comic relief and James Stewart is of course right on target giving a melancholy aspect to the tale. It's a pity the creators thought it necessary to have Cornel Wilde fake a French accent otherwise his performance is quite good.It's also refreshing to see actors especially from this time period doing their own stunts actually touching the animals and otherwise throwing themselves into their roles.While the romantic subplots flirt dangerously with cheesiness they do succeed in building genuine romantic tension.My biggest complaints are the stock villains and the deus ex machina resolution of one of the love triangles.Still this is good solid entertainment. Movie lovers will find plenty to interest them including Jimmy Stewart shown exclusively in clown makeup Charlton Heston's first star role and cameos from Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.".

	schema:headline " Fascinating spectacle from another era";
	schema:reviewBody "It's quite astonishing how many reviews of this movie appear to read along the lines of all it shows is a circus and no plot to speak of and then suggest this means it is boring. I would beg to differ. Indeed there really isn't much of a plot that ever develops but then the title is 'The Greatest Show on Earth' not 'The Greatest RomanceComedyTragedyStory on Earth'. But that does not by any stretch of the imagination mean this movie is dull or boring. Watch it with an open mind expecting a semidocumentary about one of the greatest spectacles and logistical exercises imaginable and you won't be disappointed. Speaking as someone who has never and will never be able to see a circus with all of the incredible acts seen here I found it quite incredible and very fascinating. The amazing feats performed by both animals and humans had me almost on the edge of my seat at times wondering just what could go wrong. The portrayal of a very large 'family' of circus entertainers complete with their menagerie of various small and large animals trained to perfection is something that is carried off very well by director Cecil B DeMille. I have to agree with other reviewers that the acting in terms of dialogue and emotion leaves a lot to be desired  though Gloria Grahame does an outstanding job with a mediocre script.

And we get to see lots of that talent here. I'm surprised that this movie won 'Best Picture'  especially given the competition but that said for sheer 'wow factor' watch this on a large screen forget the plot and dialogue and just enjoy the 'Greatest Show on Earth'.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's quite astonishing how many reviews of this movie appear to read along the lines of all it shows is a circus and no plot to speak of and then suggest this means it is boring. I would beg to differ. Indeed there really isn't much of a plot that ever develops but then the title is 'The Greatest Show on Earth' not 'The Greatest RomanceComedyTragedyStory on Earth'. But that does not by any stretch of the imagination mean this movie is dull or boring. Watch it with an open mind expecting a semidocumentary about one of the greatest spectacles and logistical exercises imaginable and you won't be disappointed. Speaking as someone who has never and will never be able to see a circus with all of the incredible acts seen here I found it quite incredible and very fascinating. The amazing feats performed by both animals and humans had me almost on the edge of my seat at times wondering just what could go wrong. The portrayal of a very large 'family' of circus entertainers complete with their menagerie of various small and large animals trained to perfection is something that is carried off very well by director Cecil B DeMille. I have to agree with other reviewers that the acting in terms of dialogue and emotion leaves a lot to be desired  though Gloria Grahame does an outstanding job with a mediocre script.

At first its very interesting but it seems as if everything is exaggerated on so many levels.The acting was not spectacular to watch but it was quite interesting seeing Charlton Heston in his first lead role. I found many of the characters like the tone of the movie annoying after awhile. Who I did like a lot was James Stewart as the philosophical clown. He to me saved the film in that he gave it a much needed extra layer. Sadly though after Stewart there was not much else.The directing of the much respected Cecil DeMille was non existent to me. I found the movie corny at times and his use of Betty Hutton was a mistake. The look of the movie was very good at times but it did not generate that magical feeling that classics need to have. The writing was actually pretty good considering how shallow much of the movie was.From movies like this did the term Hollywood Trash come up. There is no depth no valid attempt at drawing emotions out of the audience and simply no artistic value to the film. Then of course the many holes in the plot throughout. This movie was consistently annoying and frustrating. I even had a sense through this film that much of what I was watching was not only and inaccurate depiction of circus life but instead the opposite of how it really is. Why this won best picture is beyond me but its not like the first or the last time the Oscars will and have made a mistake.".

Anyway back to the film it's better then going to any circus I have ever been to or seen anywhere before. DeMille's voice as narrator is amazing and makes everything he says feel grander and epic. The cast was good but were more of a back up to the spectacle. Heston does his best work of the film towards the end and Stewart is great as always. I only wish these two would have shared more screen time or gone on to star in another movie together two amazing talents. I have heard this movie be lumped into conversations about the worst best picture winners ever and I could not disagree more. The only other movie I have seen from that year was Singin' in the Rain which is also very good but no where near the epic feel.

Adapted from a Georges Simenon novel the plot of EN CAS DE MALHEUR is quite predictable and not entirely convincing but the consummate professionalism of all concerned smooths over any bumps that come up along the way. Bardot is an aimless youth who together with her reluctant girlfriend amateurishly attempts to pull off a smalltime jewel heist that inevitably goes wrong and eventually picks up Gabin's name at random from a phone book to act as her defense counsel in court not having the financial means to pay for his services she elects to remunerate him in the only way she knows how seduction. Although this particular sequence as shown in the finished film is disappointingly chaste the deleted clip reproduced at the end of the copy I acquired is however too crude to be seen at such an early stage of the film and in my opinion the director was wise to jettison it in any case he did contrive to gives us a good look at the gloriously naked body solely from the back of course of the 23year old Bardot later on when she rushes out of the bathroom and into bed much to the chagrin of Gabin's mousy secretary of the apartment that Gabin provided her with! Needless to say Gabin is already married to the formidable Edwige Feuilliere and although on the surface she appears to condone Gabin's latest flirtation she is obviously none too happy about it. To complicate matters further Bardot is also seeing her irascible Italian lover Franco Interlenghi on the side and things come to a tragic head when she unwisely decides that loveless wealth is preferable to blissful poverty. Abetted by Jacques Natteau's noirish lighting and Rene' Cloerec's fine score the colorful cast also includes three alumni from the films of Luis Bunuel namely Julien Bertheau appearing briefly at the very end as the investigating inspector at the scene of the crime passionel JeanPierre Cassel unbilled as an animated trumpeter one of Bardot's casual lovers and an unrecognizable Bernard Musson  and even Jacques Marin and Daniela Bianchi also unrecognizable. While the film's 122minute running time would seem overgenerous on paper it is only the belated and unnecessary introduction of the character of Bardot's maid that makes one realize this as we lay watching I strongly suspect that the filmmakers wanted to push the boundaries of censorship even further by hinting at a possible mnageatrois between her Bardot and Gabin but perhaps thankfully this is not made all that clear in the few scenes they share togetherwhich is just as well since the huge difference in age between on screen lovers Gabin and Bardot and the abovementioned nude scene had already raised the proverbial conservative eyebrows! For the record the film was remade 40 years later as EN PLEIN COEUR aka IN ALL INNOCENCE with Virginie Ledoyen stepping into Bardot's 'shoes'.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's often interesting and sometimes entertaining to witness one generation of actors sharing the screen with the next sometimes handing the torch over gracefully sometimes dangling it in front of the newcomer and sending the tacit message 'take it  if you think you can carry it. We've seen it with Yves Montand and Gerard Depardieu in Le Choix des armes with Gabin himself and Alain Delon in Melodie en sous sol and here we have Gabin again but more pertinently Edwige Feuilliere facing up to Brigitte Bardot. I am arguably one of a small handful of heterosexual men who have never been able to see what all the fuss was about in the case of Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot. It would be foolish in incorrect to say they were totally inept and Monroe especially managed to appear in several films with real actors like Clash By Night All About Eve The Ashphalt Jungle Don't Bother To Knock and of course Some Like It Hot but only in the last title did she achieve abovethetitle billing. En cas du malheur is fascinating to people like me who love French cinema because it was released in 1958 which was just about the time those petulant schoolboys from Cahiers du Cinema were doing their best to destroy it and replace it with Amateur Night. Start with the script a novel by Georges Simenon who had been providing material for French cinema since the earliest days of sound add Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost who beginning with Douce in 1943 had written no less than ten outstanding screenplays largely adaptations from novels and in so doing had managed to get right up the nose of Truffaut quel dommage. With en cas de malheur they did it again even as Truffaut and Godard were preparing to take to the streets with their handheld Arris and Nagras and egos the size of a Sound Stage at MGM. Throw in Gabin and Feuilliere and you have as good a definition of the finest in French cinema as any. Call me odd but while I wouldn't cross a room let alone a street to get next to Bardot I'd cross deserts if Feuilliere was on the other side. I guess I've always preferred Class to Cute. Be that as it may this is a fine movie and well worth adding to your DVD collection.".

We've seen it with Yves Montand and Gerard Depardieu in Le Choix des armes with Gabin himself and Alain Delon in Melodie en sous sol and here we have Gabin again but more pertinently Edwige Feuilliere facing up to Brigitte Bardot.

At her trial she is defended succesfully by the jetset lawyer Gobillot played by the great Jean Gabin. Needless to tell that Gobillot gets involved by Brigitte's charms and that she becomes his mistress afterwards.'En cas de malheur' shows fascinatingly the spell young blond and beautiful Yvette  BB excercises on Gobillot    him getting into serious professional and marital trouble as a result. Of course Yvette meanwhile keeps involved with a lover of her own age.The movie also bridges a generation gap. It really is the splendid youthful beauty of Bardot against the magnificent acting by the mature Gabin and Edwige Feuillire who plays madame Gobillot.The greatest thing about this good movie is I think that Brigitte accepted second billing after Gabin. At the height of her breathtaking career she did just that and the results show her right.You may be interested to know that the story of 'Malheur' was written by Georges Simenon. He is a Belgian who became famous all over Europe for his detectivenovels featuring policeman Maigret. Also interesting is that Gabin had a love affair with Marlne Dietrich at the end of the forties I believe. So he knew about beautiful actresses when Brigitte met him for the first time on the set of 'Malheur' she was so overawed that she spoke her lines wrongly. Gabin understanding made a few mistakes himself in his lines    purposely thus putting Brigitte at ease. It worked.The end of 'Malheur' fits well Yvette is murdered by her lover the young one. A crime out of jealousy.".

Franco Interlenghi gives a deft performance as the young lover Mazettitough a little vulgar not willing to give Bardot up.AutantLara had to make a concession to 50's morality when dealing with Yvette's sexuality. Simenon shows us she is bisexual and very easy with her affections with the maid Janine as well as with the two men in her life. On screen we see very little of this the censors could be happy.".
